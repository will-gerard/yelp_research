Honestly, Ive never written a bad comment on Yelp. But this place kind of deserves it. A group of 6 of us went on a busy Saturday morning. We knew that there would be a wait, but didn't antisipate an hour wait, epecially when we were told 20 minutes. When they finally called our name 30 minutes after we checked in, 3 of us came to the host stand ready to be seated. The incredibly RUDE host told us that we needed our whole party to be seated ( I really wish she would have told us that when we checked in!!!) After the rest of our party had arrived, we walked up to the host stand and informed them that our party was complete. She then informed us that we would have to wait for a table to get up because they gave our table away. No big deal, so we stood up front and waited..... and waited..... and waited. Until finally the hostess heard us talking about how long we had waited, so she begrudgingly led us to our table while she rolled her eyes at us. The service once we sat at the table was fine, and the food was excellent. But i have NEVER been treated like that before as a guest.  I have been in the Restaraunt industry for almost 8 years, 5 of which I was a host, and 3 years as a server. I usually am not one to complain because I know how it is being on the other side of things. But seriously, the front of house service here is absolutely appauling. In my 8 years, I have NEVER treated a guest the way that I was treated here. Hopefully they hire some good people soon...

I was extremely excited to come to the Tempe improv last Friday (8/21) because I'd never been! When we arrived everyone who worked there was very pleasant! Once we were seated however, no one came to greet us or even take our drink orders for at least 20 minutes. After the first 10 minutes of us waiting, we even asked a host if he could grab a server for us, but another 10 minutes went by with no service, and the show was about to start. Once we finally tracked down a manager, we informed him and he apologized profusely and sent over a server immediately. Kimmie was absolutely fantastic and really turned the night around for us. Once we had been served by Kimmie, we realized that ALL of the servers were running around like crazy... Most likely from having too many tables. I have worked in a restaurant for the last 11 years and obviously don't like complaining. So my only request is that this establishment would staff a few more servers. Other than that... Everything else was wonderful and the managers even bought us shots for our wait. I really appreciated Kimmie taking wonderful care of us after such a rough start. We will definitely be back.

This place is TO DIE FOR!  My boyfriend and I made a reservation here for our anniversary. When I called to make the reservation the woman who helped me was so delightful, it made us excited for our visit!  The only reason I left off one star was because the night of our visit, we were running a little late, I called to inform them just so we wouldn't lose our reservation & since I am in the restaurant business, I know its a nice courtesy so they can plan for other reservations. When I called and spoke to the Maitre d , he seemed flustered. When I told him we apologized for us being late. He said, "Just get here when you get here and we'll figure it out." He was abrupt and quite cold. I was kind of thrown off guard, and when we finally got there, when we approached the host stand, no one even looked at us for a good minute or two, they were busy having conversations amongst themselves.  Even though we weren't too happy with that,  we were seated right away, they brought over champaign to celebrate our Anniversary! We were soooo ecstatic and very grateful. Our server was SO knowledgable and very understanding when we took a while to order (Everything looked so good and we just couldn't decide!!)  Our food was absolutely amazing and I seriously cant say enough how great the server was.  I would definitely return. It is definitely a place to check out. :)

I came here on date night with my boyfriend, and we were blown away! Our server Maria was awesome, she was super nice, and seriously was one of the best servers I've had in a while.  We started off with chips and guacamole, which were amazing... And I also ordered the skinny marg which was HUGE and equally awesome! We ordered the fajitas for two and it was super tasty and a TON of food. We will definitely be back!

Just tried Pho for the first time here, and I'm obsessed. First we started with the Shrimp & Pork Spring Roll, which came with an awesome peanut sauce for dipping. Then moved onto the Pho Tai for our meal. Everything was out so quickly and tasted amazing and fresh. Like the other reviews I've seen on Yelp, the service here is not as friendly as I'd hoped, but I think the food makes up for their very quiet/unpersonable demeanors. The service isn't bad I just think it's different.... I will definitely be back!

Ate lunch here today for the first time and enjoyed it so much! I had the kale Caesar wrap and sweet potato hash. Both were awesome. I really liked the patio atmosphere, it was a beautiful day so we chose to sit outside, the inside layout is a bit small for my taste but I guess you could just call it cozy. The outside chair I sat in was quite uncomfortable, but it's definitely not something that would deter me from going back. The only unfortunate thing that my boyfriend and I did not enjoy was the INSANELY long line we waited in, obviously we came right during the lunch rush, which is not their fault that they are so busy, but it was frustrating that there was only one register being utilized because the other was for To-Go/Pick-Up orders only. I feel like if they could add another register it would have made a huge difference. All in all, the food was amazing and even though we waited a good thirty minutes to place our order, it was delivered to us very quickly. So I will definitely be back... I'm a Chop Shop fan now!
