Wow! Super good. They know the local tastes because the pho comes with a whole cut up jalapeno and 2 cut up limes. This is a barrio secret that focuses on good food. So good it's almost packed at 2pm on Monday.

My favorite Thai place in Arizona by far! My go to spot for dates, business meetings, and just because it's Wednesday.

Poliberto's 43rd & Glendale Cost: $1 Service: 1 of 5, DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE WE GOT A BURRITO instead of a taco!  Presentation: 3 of 5 Taste 1 of 5, "not that great" DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE WE GOT A BURRITO! Seriously? In a taste test of 7 local taco shops, you failed to actually give us a taco the first time, and the tester wouldn't even eat the whole thing.

Always fantastic for brunch. Great mimosas. I've been here quite a few times and always enjoyed it.

After discovering this place 2 years ago I think it is the best restaurant in Glendale if you want Thai. Maybe even the best in greater Phoenix. The service is very fast, and all the waitresses are super nice and friendly.  However, this place can be so popular at certain times that it packs out. Sunday's are filled until 4. Sometimes lunch times can get busy too but that is because they are just so good, people make it a regular spot. Closed Monday's so save your craving for another day. The heat index is more towards the generic audience, so if you want more than hot you might have to say "Thai hot." I have been here dozens and dozens of times and they have never made a dish wrong.   My girlfriend will ask to get Tom Yum. Every week! She's loves it. The Pad Thai, Pad Prik King, and the cashew entree are my super favorites. The menu is in English but everyone here is Thai so if you can't find what you're looking for you can ask for it by the Thai name if you know that already. Tip the waitresses well, they are all going to college at GCU.

A pretty interesting experience having my back walked on for the first time. I thought it was pretty fun. The lady was very nice.

Fantastic place to hang out, great date spot, tons of beers on tap, decent food (sandwich and burgers are the best). Great atmosphere. Staff is friendly. Beers available will change as you sit there so if you find something in a flight you like better order a full one quick. That's Part of the fun.

Dan did fantastic work on my prius. I don't have covered parking and I noticed a huge cooling effect on my car immediately and it takes less to cool down when I'm running around. Only took 90 minutes and Dan was great at giving me information and chatting through the process. I would highly recommend using his services. There's a good reason he gets perfect scores.

Taco Mich 35th & Glendale Cost: $1 Service: 2 of 5, Slow, and had to order twice in Spanish. Presentation: 3 of 5 Taste 2 of 5, no flavor and it was cold. Why would it be cold if you took forever just to make two tacos?
