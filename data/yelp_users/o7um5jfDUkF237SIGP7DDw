Let me say, in a city where service is dead, where people treat customers like cattle, I was blown away to have SUPERB customer service at this place. Our food came out late and, even without complaining, the waitress told her manager we were waiting for awhile and the manager comped our meal proactively. They couldn't have been nicer and BREAKFAST WAS BOMB. I am so impressed they still care about customer service, a rarity in Vegas, so this place gets 5 stars from me.

Delayed 5 hours to Vegas....got in at midnight....lost a whole night for just a weekend stay. No compensation, no apologies. Nail in the coffin? The pre-paid shuttle to the strip is MORE expensive to book through Allegiant. Never. Fly. Again.

This was my first acupuncture experience and I am a fan. Mayo has great energy and I applaud her business model. Acupuncture can be very expensive per session but Mayo's "community" setup helps her keeps her overhead low and her prices reasonable, especially for people needing multiple treatments. She is very patient and allows you to relax while needled as long as you like. I will definitely be coming back here for any future treatments.

This is actually on Osborn and 7th street. what a great place, complex flavors at a good price. I recommend the "boots were made Oaxacan" cocktail. The building has a lot of history and really puts midtown on the map. All of the tacos were off the charts. Bang!
