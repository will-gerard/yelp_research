Service here absolutely blows. I've only experienced good service by one gentleman. Otherwise, employees are rude and have an, "I could care less" attitude. Staples down the way is so much better, in every aspect.

Employees do not abide by return policy. And if they decide to, they blatantly act as if they're doing you a favor. I understand working at Marshall's is no dream job, but 95% of the employees (particularly the ones at the register) are some of the most unenthusiastic and unpleasant workers I've ever come across. Comparable to the DMV.

THIS LOACTION SUCKS. Cash clerks are always really nice, but the roaming employees are unknowledgable, unhelpful and disgruntled if you ask for help (if, you can find anyone to help you). No one is ever in the lumber dept. and only one person in the paint dept.

DON'T LET THE OUTSIDE SCARE YOU AWAY! This place is GREAT! It took a few mins to get seated/acknowledged, but I was in no rush. I got vegan Pho and it was the best I've ever had. If you want to leave off on a lightly sweet note, "Peaceful Pink" is what I recommend. (cranberry juice + soymilk topped with rose buds, SO GOOD!)

Yelp has paved the way for businesses to receive honest, constructive criticism that they otherwise never would have received, so it amazes me how businesses don't use negative Yelp reviews to their advantage.   This Chipotle obviously doesn't give a s*** because they've never changed. My visits to this location are far and in between as the employees have a profoundly SOUR & UNWELCOMING attitude. Rice is almost always uncooked. Chipotle on Thomas is ALWAYS A LAST RESORT, I need food like now and don't want to wait kind of situation. Bleh.

Whenever I go from PHX to Tucson or vice versa, I take the Arizona Shuttle over the Greyhound at any chance I get (DUHH). It's double the price, BUT OH SO WORTH IT.   Service is always spot-on, they offer mini waters and have multiple convenient drop-off locations in Tucson. Shuttles are sometimes rattly, but otherwise are in great to good condition. I'd recommend taking AZ Shuttle for sure as I've never had any issues with them.

I've only been here once but I remember it being very good. It's not the most trendiest spot and sort of has a franchise-e feel to it, but I'd come here again for sure granted my meal is being paid for.

Pharmacists were incompetent and lacked communication between each other. A simple drop off turned into a repetitive, 12 question process. I gave them my pharmacy discount card and it took them almost 15 minutes to process the information. Drop your scrips off down the street at Safeway over this place.

A quiet but poppin' and trendy 5 star hotel. Interiors are modern and really well done. Everything about the Valley Ho is astounding and will probably blow your d*ck off. I f****** love this hotel and recommend it whenever I get the chance. It's a really swank place to have a vacation, stay cation or business stay (if you're swank enough).

I've dined in and gotten the Thai Basil w/ tofu about 3 times and everything has always been good-- but that all changed when I got pick up tonight. The carrots and another flat white vegetable tasted like a Chinese restaurant. Literally, it tasted like I had just licked a booth at a Chinese Restaurant. I can think of no other way to describe it. All of the veggies were overly oily and soaked to death in high sodium juice, and now I have guilt. Excessively fried veggie spring rolls were less than mediocre. Don't lie to yourself thinking you're being healthy just because you're getting rice + veggies. Everything is oily and sodium saturated I will absolutely never return to this unauthentic dump again. $17 down the facking drain, damn it.

Friday night...super f****** loud but I'm not 60 years old so who cares. After a night of drinking I came here for food and water. I ordered the veggie sandwich with a half and half side of onion strings and pistachio coleslaw. The sandwich was OK, but the ciabatta bread was super soft and delicious. Coleslaw was suuuper good. Onion strings were just OK. Tasted more like grease than anything else. Atmosphere and aesthetic is interesting and pleasing. I'd totally come here again but I'd probably order something else :)

The woman with an extremely short hair cut had no idea what she was doing. I was sitting there in pain thinking how I couldn't wait for it to be over. She hurt me so bad, fast forward to two days later and I can barely walk or even lay down. STAY AWAY

Before I contacted On Site Window Tinting, I called about 10 different places. They either didn't answer or wanted an outrageous price for low qual tint. Scott, the owner, answered right away and was very pleasant to do business with. He did a fabulous job and the price was just right. Not to mention he came to me- it doesn't get much better than that! Get your windows tinted by Scott and you won't regret it!!

Their coffee has a really distinct taste. If you consider yourself to be a connoisseur, I would recommend you try their drip or better yet, the pour over. Service is always friendly. Interior aesthetic is on point.

Store is huge with interesting selection. ...it was past closing time and one of the guys named Mike went out of his way to unscrew some hairpin legs off a table for me. I could tell it had been a long day for him and figured he was probably hungry and tired...in spite of all that, he was very pleasant while helping me out. I offered him a tip but he refused. Really friendly service. I would recommend Zinnias to a friend.

Went on a Monday night with a friend who knew the bartender Jeremy so maybe my experience is a little bias, but the service, fiilm, and beer was beyond great. The vintage seats are grimy and probably filled with bed bugs but if you're like most of the hipsters that go here you probably won't care.

There's so many positive things to say. When I first discovered PB online, I searched and searched for at least one bad review. I couldn't find a single one. So I decided to attend a one-time $23 class.  I initially envisioned PB being pretentious and click-y, but upon walking through the front doors I quickly realized these were not characteristics of pure barre. All of the girls are so nice, knowledgable and patient, and the instructors are there to adjust and guide you. There are women of all ages in class-- not judging, but empowering each other.  Since day one, PB has changed my life. After my first class I couldn't wait to go back. It's now literally the highlight of my every other day.  The results I FELT were instantaneous. I wouldn't say I was overweight, but to my standards, I was not where I wanted to be-- I like feeling strong and being toned. With 3-4 classes per week, clean eating, sufficient hydration and sleep, I was able to SEE results by my 5th class. I am fully addicted and couldn't be happier. What you put in is what you get out. PURE. BARRE. WORKS!!!!! The only thing you will regret is not going sooner.

I'm in love with Crescent's bean & cheese burrito. Plenty of booze to choose from, great vibe and there's always something going on here. Guacamole and chips are from another planet, SO DELICIOUS. Jessica is the best server here, no doubt. Venue wise, Crescent is the best in the valley. The sound is incomparable, and it's a very "intimate" setting, ya dig?

Nami and Green definitely fall into the category of "fat vegan." With that being said, the strawberry "milk"shakes and doughnuts are my fave. I'm not sure if they're on the menu or not, but you will kick yourself for not ordering one.

I decided to go with I Clean Carpets due to all the positive feedback on Yelp and because of the FIRM PRICES and no up sells, which is rare in the carpet cleaning industry. I spoke with the owner, Rob whom was very polite and professional. Apparently Rob usually does the carpets himself; but due to mechanical issues with his van, he had to send one of his guys, Alex to do the job- which was fine. Alex did a good job, but according to the home owner, (I work as a personal assistant) "wasn't up to his standards." (I wonder how differently it would have turned out had Rob done the job?) Anyways, Rob sent Alex with a few 10% off coupons since he couldn't show up himself. I was also left with high qual booties and a bottle of pet stain remover! It's been at least 5 weeks since the day of the cleaning and carpets still look good. I'll probably be using my discount to get my home done very soon based on my experience. Four stars because my of my boss's response. Five stars for quality of service.

My boyfriend and I love this place. It's definitely our #1 choice for breakfast. Service is great and so is the food. The owner always acknowledges us, says it's nice to see us. I get the 3 Sister's and my bf gets the Wilcox Avenue. Also, if you sub a veggie for meat they take a dollar off. Two thumbs up!!!

The service was astoundingly friendly and upbeat, but my food was too greasy...just wasn't fresh or healthy-minded enough for me (and I ordered a salad, too). I suppose this is an okay place if you're into border-line Mexican fast food.   I've only been here once, but unfortunately for Gadzook's (and fortunately for the well-being of my stomach) I don't anticipate ever coming back.

If you like A/C during the hot months, this is not the place for you. Last summer the A/C went out at least once a week. The schedule was, "it will be on by Thursday." Bugs were a constant. I lived here from Sept 2012 through July 2013 in three different units so I know the bug issue wasn't specific to one single unit. Office management gossips and talks negatively about the tenants when they think no one is around. I agree with fair housing laws but Cabana seems to have no filter when letting people become tenants. 8 out of 10 are either heavily on drugs or are completly strung out of their minds from prior drug addiction.  Slapping bright neon colors on a building and calling it good DOES NOT qualify it as being tenant ready. The exterior of the apts may look pretty but the innards are decrepit. (This was someting that was verbalized to me by one of the maintenance men who quit because he couldn't even stand Cabana himself.) Once, I tried taking a bath and the bath filled up with yellow water. Just more proof to show how haggard this place really is. The only positive thing I can say about this black hole is that Kim, the head maintenance guy was awesome.

During my residency, people did not pick up after their pets and let their dogs urinate on the inner grounds of complex so it always smelled like piss. CHANDA the manager is a pitiful excuse of a professional. Most times she would not answer the phone and was rarely in office during office hours. She made living here a complete and total NIGHTMARE. Chanda gives Carol Mary + The Continental (the sister complex down the street) a bad name. On the other hand, Juan, the friendly and helpful maintenance guy, the concrete flooring, pleasant tenants, the fact that there were never any bugs and location of this complex were some pros to living here.

What I get when I come to FEZ: cumin cinnamon carrot soup + the veggie black bean burger which comes with a side salad.   Everything is exceptional right down to the dressing for the salad. My bill normally comes out to about $26 which is a little on the pricey side, but I am never disappointed. Whether it be dine-in, or take-out, FEZ is always consistent and always delicious.
