First time here and it was really good. I ordered the bobbie sandwich since I hear everyone raving about it. It was ok. Not my favorite. Place is really clean and wasn't busy at all for lunch around 1130. I like going to a place where I can get in and get out. Staff was really friendly. They gave me this punch card.. buy 10 get the 11th free. Very nice. About the same prices as subway so I wasn't upset. Plus the sizes of food are definitely moneys worth. At least I think. For anyone in the Chandler area, this is definitely a place to stop in and try.

For the amount of money you pay at this place for 2 nights, its definitely not worth it. The holiday inn express is better and cheaper. But for convenience I had to stay here. I guess its what you make it..

Definitely amazing food and drinks but good lord, I'm sure I'm not the only one upset about a 35.00 drink when the "blender" it came in was plastic and cost probably 5 cents to make.

I have had insurance through Steve for the last 10 years. Never disappointed nor have I ever had an issue that wasn't able to resolved immediately! These guys are GREAT for all your insurance needs. I have no plans on leaving as long as he's in business. Which I think will be a long time. Thank guys for everything!!

Not bad. clean, not busy. Food was as good as McDonald's gets. The only bad thing is that the employees were yelling and fighting in the back. Kinda funny but really unprofessional considering the age of them and that the manager was standing there laughing at them.

This McDonald's can kiss it. And there servers. I only been here 3 times since its right around the corner form my work. I'd rather drive 10 miles to a good service and better food place then this. The service always sucks. The Piss inside lack communication and brains. As well as emotions. I think a robot could do better. And the food is always stale. Like its been under a heat lamp all day. Nasty fools.

My first time being to this kind of restaurant and I have to say I wasn't displeased nor was I impressed. If you want to get your moneys worth you literally have to stack the food above and beyond the bowls rim. Kinda a lot of choices which makes it difficult to make a good combination if your new to this kind of thing. However all in all I have to say my experience was good. Service was great. Just remember to get your monies worth.

One word... Amazing! Been here twice so far and haven't been disappointed either time. The staff is pretty friendly, which is a bonus in my book. The food has been on point everytime! For being a new business in this town, these guys have it all together in my opinion. Keep up the great work guys!! I'll keep coming back for sure!
