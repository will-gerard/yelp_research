So much for being accurate with their drive thru orders. I got the recpt with the correct meal on it, only to find out when I got home I over paid for some disgusting chicken nuggets and a large coke when I had paid for something more expensive on the menu. I'm really disappointed and will not be back... Gross

We loved this hike! We did the whole loop, me, and my 9 and 12 year old... Every bend has its own beauty and intrigue. We enjoyed the ruins, the flowers, the creek, and especially the big old saguaro cactus. We had an amazing time. We are hoping to get back there very soon... Beautiful and energizing place

For a pizza place, they have the best burgers around! I love the service, and the food is phenomenal! One of my favorite places to go for dinner!

Love this place! Being able to take what you want off the belt is amazing. My kids loooooove this place! It's super inexpensive too! For all 4 of us with drinks it's under $30! Great place!

Omg so delish! The beverage bar was amazing, lots of choices for flavored pop, and the shakes there are amazing! I took my kids there, we all ordered some burgers and fries, and it was all so great! The staff is steller, and the place is all around the best restaurant for families!!! Love love love

So darn yummy! I have three kids and we all found something healthy and super delicious on the menu. We sat out on the cool patio, and the food was made very fast! I have a son that is autistic and very picky with his menu, we ordered the gyro and he ate all of it, and wanted more! Enough said! We love it!

I've been a big red robin fan for years... Like the food, it's convenient, etc. but this time was different. We went in, and immediately my kids were attracted to the little computer on the table. So I let them play with it. Little did I know, there was a 1.99 entertainment fee on the bill for using the little tablet thing. I had a tablet in my purse, and a cell phone they could play on for free. I would have rather just sat and talked with my kids to be honest... Just a heads up red robin, you might want to inform your customers of any extra charges on the bill, before they accumulate it. I am kind of disappointed and feel a little cheated. Even tho it was only 1.99, it wasn't worth it. Not going back there, or any other red robin from now on.
