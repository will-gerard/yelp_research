Service here is the worst! I called 4 different times for reservations and activities first time I was told to call back in 10 minutes, second time I was in the middle of booking an activity when the person asks "can I call you back a customer just walked up" I waited three hours before calling back and had to leave a VM. My husband was adamant about going there so he tried to call and was forced to leave a VM going on the third day and still no call back, we have booked another place that is wonderful!!

Dr. Paris is amazing! He's super friendly and very knowledgeable and just relatable. He knew exactly how I was feeling about my vision and helped me find the best prescription for me! I will be a customer for life! The girls in the front were great they helped me with my frames and let me put on a fashion show, you can tell they really love working there!

They were great, came out same day for our repair, the guy was very nice and honest and the price was very reasonable. I will be using their company for any future repairs which I hope we don't need lol!

I absolutely love this place! The staff is always very friendly and they take great care of my dogs, they smell great for weeks! We choose to board them when we are out of town which is a couple times per year, there rates are great and they take awesome care of my pups. I switched to them from a popular mobile spa people use around here I had the worst experience with, this place outshines them 100%!   Thanks Kimbur!

When I first signed up almost 2 years I enjoyed the atmosphere and the girls were super nice and said there's no commitment just a 30 day notice for cancellation. However, when I called to get the paper to cancel all of a sudden I am in a contract that's not up until the end of the year and I will have to pay until then. I explained when I signed up they told me all I needed was a 30 day notice she then told me that was fine and she would fax me the paper, but really? Had I not argued with her I would have been paying until the end of the year for a mysterious contract I never signed?? Definitely shady, no wonder this place is in some kind of corporate lawsuit!!

The food was good, huge variety which is nice for large parties but seriously, these are the most rude people I have ever met. I work at a local business, we are small family owned and operated and would never ever speak to or treat our PAYING customers the way they do. When people stop coming maybe they will thing "hmm maybe we shouldn't have treated people like they were annoying us for coming to eat at our restaurant"

The restaurant inside deserves 10 stars!! Inside out taquito and Philly cheese steak with actual cheese wiz!! We have all of our company Christmas parties at the bowling alley and they treat us great, always on top of everything and it's a blast!!

Long long story short, canceled prism cable service (kept internet) because the rates got too high after telling me they would adjust the price...never happened. Sent me a box to return everything, packed it up and shipped the next day, did not write the tracking # down because eh, I though they were trustworthy. Then I see a $336.00 charge (4 weeks later) on my account for un-returned boxes!! I called and chatted online, multiple times only to be told they have NO RECORD of returned equipment and don't keep tracking numbers and maybe call UPS to see if they can find it. Called to UPS and they said if they created the label they have it for 90 days automatically it stays there for 90 days! Finally had my husband call and talk to someone let them know we already talked to UPS and someone from their company and we WILL be having a refund, she says "oh, I see right here on the account is says we received the equipment, all they have to do is pull up your account" all these phone calls and chat conversations and photo were the same day within 1 hour of each other.  Update 9/1  No refund, checked my online acct with Centurylink and they credited it to my account to use for future bills, um no I want the money back in my account that you took from it. Called at 5:15 after work to Billing (India) transferred to Payment Specialist transferred BACK to Billing, then oh we need to TRANSFER you to returns. On hold until 6 pm when they close and kicked back to India. So I will call first thing when they open and wait all day if I have to someone will be speaking with me!   Update 9/15  After being told on 9/1 a check would be cut and mailed THE NEXT DAY, still no check. I called today, after being on hold for 45 min (The fastest it's ever been might I add) the lady tells me " I apologize, I am not sure who you spoke to but, we don't offer check refunds on active accounts only credits" So you are telling me I can cancel my account to get the check but you can not cut it now, when #1 you were NOT authorized to withdraw it and #2 it was YOUR error in billing. Now they are saying we are locked into a 24 month commitment of which we are only on month 4, we have never signed any paperwork other than our initial agreement 1.5 years ago for a 12 month term which we fulfilled and if we want to cancel it's a $200 ETF fee.  I feel bad for whom ever takes my phone call EVERY DAY until I have a check in my hand.

Food is excellent, all of it! I have never had anything I didn't like and I am picky. The service needs some improvement, there are a lot of mix ups and it seems mismanaged. I'll still be back!

I love Red Mountain, I am so glad they opened an office closer to me! I have only been going for a month but I have great results and out of the girls I have seen Ginger is the best. I would highly recommend doing the RM3 shots with any program, they seem to make a huge difference in sticking with the programs!  This office is a bit hard to find since they don't have the outside sign up yet.

Holy delicious! Every single donut is amazing, the dough is so fluffy and flaky, no wonder the line is always out the door! This is our Sunday morning ritual.

By far the best urgent care in surprise! Checked in online (awesome already) for my daughter for 1 pm, barely 5 minutes in the waiting room we were taken back and saw the PA within 5 minutes of that, he was amazing with my daughter, talked about cartoons and fun stuff to make her feel comfortable! In and out within 30 minutes!

Been thinking about crossfit for awhile but never had the right fit with a gym, crossfit arms had very friendly staffing, great class schedule and a comfortable setting, we are excited to get in shape with them!!
