This one star is for the manager Libby. I loved this salon when my boy was there, but it has gone downhill since he left. She even reprimanded me for language. I refuse to go back. I will hunt my stylist down, you know a girl's hair is the holy grail of our looks.

I had a flat and came to the store with the spare tire on my car.  They were exceptional, I was in and out in a very short period of time. I had two fussy toddlers so this made all the difference in the world. Gary made sure that I got the best deal and checked the pressure on the rest of my tires. They came off very honest and genuine, I'll always be a customer!

Besides my fondness for bald men, Peter, the manager on duty was especially accommodating. It was my birthday and he made it super enjoyable (I started early, no questions asked) When I first walked in to the place I realized there was a distinction between the coffee area and restaurant itself, I had a the butcher with 4 shots of espresso (who doesn't these days) and waited for my gf in the lobby area. The decorating was superb, concrete walls with embroidered mid century sheer drapes. Krystal set up the bar and served us a couple champ bottles requested for my birthday. Vanessa, Emily and Ali are the best barista's, after only a couple visits they already knew my usual order. I will continue to be a fan, working from this location has been a blast
