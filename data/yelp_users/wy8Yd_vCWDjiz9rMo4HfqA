After living in Phoenix for three and a half years, last night was the first time I made it to a Sun's game.  There are many reasons, but I will name a few.  First, they have perpetually sucked.  Sporting events aren't very entertaining when the home crowd doesn't put on a good show.  Second, pro basketball is probably fourth on my list of favorite sports to watch.  Third, until recently, this part of downtown Phoenix wasn't necessarily a great place to spend a Friday night.  I can say that I had a blast last night.  The team played great, and they were playing the Mavericks so I got to see Mark Cuban (probably my favorite entrepeneur from Shark Tank) cheer his team on to the slim victory.  The concessions were reasonable, but not as well priced as at the Diamondbacks games, and the staff was friendly and helpful.  I would say outside of the game, the highlight was hands down the "Dancing Dads" - or 25 overweight white guys dancing to hip hop in t-shirts and shorts.  Without a question, the most awkward white guys twerking in unison I've ever seen.  The kiss cam is always entertaining, and it seemed like the entire crowd had a great time.  If you live in Phoenix, and you enjoy people watching, you should go see a game or two, I had a great time!

"I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie everyone's *really* hoping makes it happen. I want you to be like the guy in the rated R movie, you know, the guy you're not sure whether or not you like yet. You're not sure where he's coming from. Okay? You're a bad man. You're a bad man, Mikey. You're a bad man, bad man."   Maybe I'm alone here - but when I stepped inside this joint I felt like I was on the Swingers movie set, which is easily one of my favorite movies.  I have never been to any jazz lounges in L.A., but this is without a doubt one of the coolest places I've been in Phoenix.    Whiskey Kiss opened for Nikki Hill - and I was QUITE impressed with both.  Seeing these guys play for a few hours for a $10 cover while drinking $2 cans o' PBR just doesn't get much better on a Wednesday night.    I'm not cool enough to call myself rockabilly, and I wasn't even sure I'd enjoy Nikki's music - but you just can't help but jam when she starts crooning.  I mention the artists, because I imagine there are very few places that could book that kind of talent for a reasonable price on any day of the week.   Bravo Rhythm Room, your service was friendly, your beer was cold, your bathrooms were clean (but seriously get the urinal fixed) and the ambiance was electric.  Can't wait to go back!!

I was making a "HAVE TO" trip to Trader Joe's on Saturday and pulled out my yelp app to see if I had anything worthy of lunch bookmarked in the neighborhood.  I did not, so I then searched and filtered based on highest reviewed.  Niccoli's came up, and it was settled.  The parking lot, for the most part, was empty... but that didn't deter me from going in.  The smell that hit me upon entering reassured me that I had made the right choice.  Since I'm rarely in that neck of the woods, I ordered a meatball sub and an antipasto salad - knowing full well I would not be able to eat both in one sitting.    While waiting, I struck up a conversation with the female owner, who proceeded to tell me a story about a photo on the wall I had noticed of her and her husband, over 50 years ago, on the night of their wedding night.  Just the fact that she took a few minutes to tell me about their lives that long ago while I waited for my food was worthy of at least four of these stars.  Then, as I was seated in the dining room next door, listening to Sinatra's greatest hits, the food came and it was out of this world.  Easily one of the best meatball subs I've ever consumed - the bread had the perfect chew - and wasn't soggy from the delicious fresh marinara.  The salad had banana peppers, delicious olives, provolone, three different meats (salami, mortadella and pepperoni) and quite possibly the best Italian dressing to cover it in.  There were not many others who came to eat - but plenty were in and out for various Italian needs.  Their store is small, but appeared to have anything you might need for an authentic Italian meal.    Check this place out, whether you go for ingredients to make your own meal or want to try something they make fresh it's totally worth your time. If they're not that busy, ask about the beautiful picture on the wall and you're sure to hear a great story about Joe & Peppy's wonderful life.

Can we just sit down for a minute and talk about Cookie Butter?  Are you seated?  Ok.  If you have yet to try this delicious invention, please direct yourselves to the nearest Trader Joes and buy yourself a bottle.  It will not break the bank, for less than $10 you can get a bottle of this delicious concoction (like a spreadable gingerbread / cinnamon butter), a box of graham crackers and some apples.    Don't do this type of thing all the time, 'cause diabetes, but next time you have a party and need a suggestion for what to bring, this is for sure a party pleaser.  On top of this, TJ always has great stuff to eat and drink.  A decent selection of beer (although every time I go I wish it was a tad more diverse) and wine, and fresh produce (most of it with organic options).  The staff is almost annoyingly friendly (not quite to Oregano's standards, but you get the picture)... and their stores are always clean and tidy.  Even if all you do is walk in and buy a bottle of Cookie Butter (stay away from the cocoa swirl, it's too much cocoa and not enough cookie butter) you won't regret it.

The way I ended up coming to this joint is far from typical.  Matter of fact, it's so far from typical that most of my friends questioned my insanity for even showing up on a random school night during twilight.  That said, it's really a good story but I shall save that for another time.  Not only is it tucked away in a very cool / scenic part of Scottsdale, but the layout is vast, expansive and impressive.  The patio has personality.  This is important when one lives in a place where outside dining is preferable for eight months out of the year.  The help / service were impeccable and everything I tried was tasty and affordable.  If you can get behind the culture and history of born & bred Phoenix family stories, this is one not to be missed.  I'll be back without question!

Best authentic Mexican near where I live = clutch.  I've had the carne asada, the chips and salsa & their breakfast burritos.  All of which I recommend and will be getting again.  The service is great and the ambiance is what you want out of a Mexican restaurant.  Best time to hit this place up due to my schedule is the weekend, which I'll be doing as long as I live near South Mountain!

What a cool place that sits atop the mountain directly behind where I've been living for the past year or so!  The tour guides were knowledgeable and the castle spoke for itself in regards to being unique and eclectic enough to be worth the price of the tour.  The back story / decor / knick knacks are all of the following:  1. impressive 2. incredibly creepy 3. very cat-heavy 4. Beetlejuice'esque 5. plentiful  I appreciated all of the quotes and words of wisdom from the princess, Mary Lou aka Joan Wayne - those alone are truly worth checking out.  Also, am I the only one who feels like the bar doubled as a S&M dungeon?    Maybe... but I digress.  It's $10 for the tour and 50 cents for a water, which you'll want - especially if you're touring between May & October.    I'm a film student, and I TOTALLY want to film a short horror film in this joint.  I asked the tour guides, and they were probably humoring me, but that's ok.    This is worth your time and is a great way to kill a couple hours near south mountain!

I have, for the most part, avoided sushi since moving here to Phoenix from Seattle for obvious reasons.  So - to compare this to a sushi joint on the coast just isn't fair.  That said, for Phoenix, this place is right up there with Ra in regards to quality and freshness.  The service is what impressed me right off the bat.  There is something to be said for a place that hires pretty and friendly girls in a location where you wouldn't necessarily expect it.    The $10 lunch special is quite a value, and when you consider the free edamame for checking in via yelp (I love those little perks) and then get a delicious beer to go with it you're spoiling yourself for lunch at this place.  The miso soup and salad that come with the lunch are equally delicious and it is safe to say that I will be back at least once a month going forward.  Bravo Sakana - you won a fan!!  My plan is to go at some point for dinner to get the tepanyaki - I imagine the quality will be right there with Benihana at a fraction of the price.

We've been trying to use our Living Social deal to this place for a couple months now... we finally had the chance on Saturday night.  My take on Melting Pot has always been that the cheese and the dessert are awesome - but that I could pretty much do without the meat course in the middle.  So we started with the spinach artichoke cheese fondue, which was really really good.  The wedge salad with bacon and peppercorn ranch, also good.  Then we got to the meat course.  Without turning this into a novel, we discovered that one of the shrimp that had been cooking in our broth fhad not been de-turded.  That's right, it had been cooking with the rest of our meat, in poo-broth.    So, there goes the appetite, and after bringing it up to the waiter - and his discussing it with the manager - they were "gracious" enough to take a $5 beer off our tab.  I'm sorry, but serving poop to customers, should pretty much be a no-no.  Especially at those prices.  I kept thinking of the line from one of my favorite movies, The Jerk, "You would think, at these prices, you could keep the POOP off the food!".  I digress... suffice it to say, we won't be going back to The Melting Pot.

I saw the DDD spot a few years ago and wanted to check this place out more for the sisters who own it than the food itself.  After eating there, the food stands on it's own.  In Phoenix, I don't think you can get better carne asada.  If you like breakfast burritos, you haven't had one until you've had their carne asada breakfast burrito with potatoes, eggs and cheese.  Fantastic.  I work around the corner, and eat here at least twice a month for that reason.

I would like to thank Groupon for introducing us to this gem of a restaurant in good ol' Ahwatukee.  We went on a busy Friday night, and were seated immediately.  The water we got right off the bat had cucumbers in it - which reminded me of the movie "The Other Guys", and it was tasty enough that I didn't order a beverage.  Our waiter recommended the grilled eggplant appetizer, which, up to this point in my 36 years, is the best eggplant I've ever had.  The fresh marinara served on top of it was nothing to scoff at, also some of the best I've ever had.  For the main course I got the spicy penne w/ chicken and sausage, what was most impressive about this was the serving size.  I had enough for a full meal on Saturday for lunch, and it was better the day after once the flavors had time to marry.  The wife got the veal picatta - and said it was probably the best she had ever had outside of Italy.  The complimentary flatbread was warm and delicious, and their homemade gelato was the perfect capper.  We were waited on by the GM, who had a great sense of humor and was was one of the 1st waiters EVER to happily take our groupon - explaining that he's happy to know his marketing is working.  Go check this place out, groupon or not!  MOLTO BUONO!

After having lived in Seattle for seven years, there are just a few things I haven't even tried here in the Phoenix area.  Sushi for example.  Or, I guess, seafood in general.  For some strange reason, Thai food has been on the list of things that I just hadn't ventured out to try here, assuming there's no way it could live up to how great the options were in Seattle.  Then, for a co-workers birthday, I went here.  Not only was I immediately impressed with the service, the waitress recommended Thai iced tea - and it was just delicious.  I got the Pad See Ew w/ beef (5 stars 'cause that's how I roll) and it was fantastical.  The lunch special (like $8) also came with a small spring roll - which I dipped in the leftover peanut salad dressing.. just wow.  So, A for ambiance, service, and perfect Thai cuisine on a very busy Friday lunch.  Brian talk Thai - Brian talk Thai VERY good.

We've been here a number of times.  The service is always consistent, the chips and salsa are always fresh, and the food is great.  Last time I was there I got the fajitas - and I subbed the green peppers for jalapenos - and I was pleasantly surprised to find they were fresh rather than jarred.  Very tasty, the only thing that keeps us from going more often is the long wait on weekends.

We were referred here by one of my wife's co-workers.  I'm a little saddened to read some of the poor reviews, but when it comes to our pets I suppose it's just tough to be impartial.  We haven't had any emergencies with our dog Puddles, but every time we've been there they've treated us well.  Pet care is one of those things where half the time you feel like you're just being taken advantage of - similar to auto repair.  But, with these guys, you feel like they're not just arbitrarily charging more just because they can.  So - I will continue to refer people there and happily take our jack russell terrier there as long as we live in Phoenix!

I truly love this place.  Not just because it's awesome food, but Chef David Traina & his wife Kiersten rock.  Ok, pretty much everyone rocks there.  I've been to a few "community dinners" there, which are 1st rate - and it's one of those "Cheers" type places where they remember your name and are always happy to see you.  I recommend this to ANYONE.  Check it out, not just 'cause I said so but because it rocks.

So you know how you crave hot dogs like a couple times a year?  Yeah... well it was America's birthday and we were craving a hot dog - I had already tried Portillo's and this was on my short list of places that were semi-close AND open on the 4th.    I got the bacon wrapped (Sonoran) jumbo dog and had a bite of their cheeseburger.  The dog had the snap I wanted (natural casing) and was flavorful and juicy - just like I had hoped.  Tried a sip of the Loganberry shake and that was fresh and tasty.  We weren't the only ones who had this thought, as the place does not accept phone in orders and the line was quite long... but once I got to the counter the service was pretty good and by the time we got home the food was still warm.  Next year when I'm craving a good dawg, I'll come back!

So let's say it's lunch, and you're in Tempe, and you're craving a cheeseburger and a beer for around $6... good luck finding that anywhere else but here.  Is it a dive?  Sure it is.  Do they have random folk betting on horse races at 11 am?  Yep.  Do dudes rocking hydraulic billiards triangles frequent a place like this?  You betcha.  Can you buy condoms in the bathroom?  Absolutely.  Seriously though, the food is good, the beer is nice & cold and the people watching, as you can tell, is top notch.  Far from gourmet, but an excellent choice in my book - and I suppose if you are looking for a place to play some pool or bet on horses you could do that too.

Perched at the bottom of the classy Hotel San Carlos, this cozy little pub was quite inviting yesterday after a long day of walking and gawking at ComicCon.  Ginger beer + Jameson totally hit the spot - followed by their French dip which was superb.  For me, with a French dip, it's all about the bread and the au jus.  I assume you've got the roast beef figured out, and they did.  The bread was nice and fresh, and the au jus was spot on.  Far too many places don't stir their au jus before putting it in the cup, which leads to basically dunking your sandwich in bland broth... but theirs was great.  The ambiance is classy and the service was good, I look forward to a mini staycation at the hotel and will definitely be back.

I enjoyed everything about my evening here.  It was the Adult Puppet Slam - and have nothing but great things to say about the level of talent and artistry it takes to successfully pull off a naughty puppet show.  This was my first one, but it seems as if they have a core of artists - but welcome other puppeteers to showcase their talent.  Scott Gesser performed a few songs, and his musical humor is always welcome regardless of the venue.  This particular audience had a couple of hecklers, and it's always nice to see how different artists handle that.    Aside from the show itself, the venue is spectacular.  If you go, find an employee (look for Franc) and ask for a quick tour either before the show or during intermission.  The history is amazing and the architecture and woodwork are beautiful.  They offer adult beverages too - which is especially nice whenever you're bombarded with dick jokes.  For those that are feeling froggy, you can actually  make your own sock puppet which I thought was a nice touch.  My only negative, is that the chairs are extremely uncomfortable.  If your booty is sensitive to this kind of thing, maybe bring a stadium seat or blanket.  Other than that, it's a great time & well worth the price of admission!

I find it almost impossible to believe that there's a better place in the valley to get costumes or costume accessories.  I'm talking about selection / quantity / price / service / organization - it would take a miracle to beat these guys.  It's a bit of a drive from Chandler, but I will be doing all my Halloween / costume shopping here from now on.  Bravo!!

Sigh.  This morning I'm a sad panda.  This location is on my way to work, so occasionally I'll stop for a coffee and a maple bar.  Today, I was feeling savory - so I went with a bagel breakfast sandwich.  Do not, under any circumstances make this mistake.  It's partially my own fault.  I don't order buffalo wings at Quizno's, I don't get potstickers at In n' Out - but since I've never had a bad item at this place, I figured why not?  I'll tell you why.  Bagel = dry / flavorless.  Eggs = un-seasoned.  Bacon = under-cooked and only ONE piece folded in half FOR AN ENTIRE SANDWICH?!?!  On top of that, no sauce / mayo / spread / schmear a.k.a. NOTHING to make up for the fail that was this morning's attempt at sustinence.  I digress.  The maple bars are always spot on, the old fashioned cake doughnuts are money - even their coffee is consistent - so I guess what I'm saying is, don't get a sandwich at a donut shop.  The end.

Trust.  It's something rarely discussed when referring to auto repair.  I like to consider myself a "man's man", but my knowledge of cars and what makes them go vroom is limited at best.  For this reason, every one needs to have a mechanic they can trust to "do the right thing".  I've been burnt more times than I care to admit, sometimes lied straight to my face - this can turn a man against an entire industry.  A good friend recommended this place, and even though it's out of the way, and it's a little run down, it's refreshing to know you can bring a problem to them and get the truth.  Thanks fellas for doing the right thing, I will refer all my local friends to you!  Keep it up.

I've never lived on the north east coast, or in Chicago, so my standards for good pizza might not be the same as some of you.  However, if the ingredients are fresh, the cheese is real, and the pizza's cooked perfectly, I'm in.  It's really tough to get all of these in a delivered pizza.  I tend to stay away from the major chains because duh - but Venezias has never disappointed.  Now - I can be talked into pizza more often than I should, but this place also has great cheese bread and salads.  And we all know that nothing dampens the guilt of a greasy pizza like a salad covered in ranch.  So - check this joint out, you won't regret it!

I love this place.  It's amazing how delicious a simple bean and cheese burrito can be.  Their red sauce is perfect, their green chile is to die for, and their strips + cheese are amazing.  When I go, I usually get the mini burritos - because I like to have both the bean / cheese & green chile.  If you like Mexican food, go to Elmer's and you won't be disappointed.  I also give credit to their location, and their student prices, getting all those Chandler High students addicted to their tasty food early on creates nostalgia for their taste buds & guarantees "for life" customers.  Bravo.

So as often as I don't venture to Snottsdale, the movie I wanted to see was only showing here so eating nearby just made sense.  The open floor plan is nice and the decor is simple but modern and clean.  Did I notice that all of the waitresses were wearing yoga pants?  I did, and that isn't a bad thing.  I got the french dip + mushrooms and swiss and a coffee to help with my hangover.  The sweet potato fries could have standed to be crunchier, but the flavor was there and the sandwich was quite tasty.  Normally at a place with a name such as this I would only stick to breakfast - but when one is hung over, you must go with your gut instinct, and I'm glad I did.  Traffic / parking was a mess, but I suppose that's to be expected on a weekend with such beautiful weather.  Overall, I dig this place and will likely be back.

My thoughts on the KG is this: you just cannot beat the value for their HH or reverse HH.  Their drink menu, combined with their discounted rolls / flatbreads / appetizers are fantastic.  I can't quite give the joint five stars because outside of the discounted time, I just think most of their menu is overpriced.  This night, at this location, our service was outstanding.  Within minutes of sitting down we had three sake bombers with a big ol' bottle of Kirin light and we were happy almost instantly.  There were a few people smoking on the porch, but not anywhere near our table so it wasn't a problem whatsoever.  For food we got the calamari, the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps, a Philly roll and flatbread to share between the six of us.  Perfect amount of food and the bill was more than reasonable.  It should be noted that there were no less than four dudes rocking Affliction shirts who were more interested in their phones than their beautiful arm candy - but whatever.

My review here is somewhat unique because my first experience was as a performer.  I'm part of The Sic Sense sketch comedy troupe and we were booked for a Thursday night show here.  While I'm not a huge fan of Scottsdale, this location is tough to beat.  With hundreds of food and drink options within walking distance, it's quite easy to make an evening out of a show here no matter what day it is.    The help was incredibly attentive, the facilities were clean and modern and the music was recent and relevant.  It has a two drink minimum, but they are reasonably priced and including tickets and drinks you can have a nice time for two here for about $50.  I'm only slightly biased, but still impressed and will certainly be back soon!

I haven't been bowling in probably six years or so.  We got there around 9:30 and played for a couple hours for $10 a head including shoes - so the price was right.  Great and random music selection, the food was better than expected and they had a nice selection of beers available by the pint or pitcher.  My childhood memories of bowling alleys aren't that great - horribly trashy people drenched in Malboro Red smoke, ashing into their beers and never being able to find a freaking lane on league night.  But since then, due to my passion for The Big Lebowski, I've come around.  I feel like if I am ever to be a more consistent bowler, I need to procure my own ball and shoes.  House balls are just filthy, and how is it that in the last thirty years they're still using the same crappy spray on the shoes?!  Who are we kidding that stuff isn't helping.  That said, bowling with friends and beer is almost always fun, and since it's reasonably priced I will probably be back!

Twas my first time - and I was really quite impressed.  When you get to the parking lot, you are not expecting to be impressed - but the layout / ambiance is quite impressive.  They have quite a large open area in the back as well as a cozy patio.  My only complaint was the men's bathroom was 100 yards away, but they're at the mercy of the building they're in.  For food we tried like five of the appetizers, I was impressed by all of them.  I loved everything I ate that night and even enjoyed a couple of their cocktails.  Truly it's a 4.5 due to the price, but I rounded up because I couldn't really find anything else I didn't enjoy.    Totally worth checking this place out, although I probably won't be back unless it's for happy hour.

Picture this... it's the evening after a long day in the sun, lots of walking, lots of sight-seeing, lots of day-drinking and oh so many Scottsdale sun dresses.  Now it's almost midnight.  You're hungry, but you're also not in any shape to drive.  Well, if you're fortunate enough to live within walking distance of this joint, you're in for a treat.  Right when you get past the parking lot, you feel like you're in line at Disneyland or Universal Studios.  There is running water, fake caverns and bridges taking you everywhere.  Plenty of tvs too but I was focused on one thing, lots of icewater and now it's time to talk about their green salsa (that happens to come for free along with chips and a yelp check in - BOOM).  In my 36 years, I have been partial to red salsa ever since I can remember.  That's only because I hadn't yet tried this one.  It's like the perfect blend of tomatillo, jalapeno and green chiles... best I've ever had.  The waiter even brought out a 2nd tub due to our inhaling it in mere moments.  So good - I can't even explain.  If you ONLY come here for the green salsa and the New Mexican potstickers you are winning at life.  I realize that maybe some of my taste buds were off due to that much day drinking, but I am convinced that whenever anything is the "best I've ever had" it's my duty to shout from a rooftop so my fellow friends and yelpers alike can also enjoy.  I don't remember which entree I ordered, and it was too difficult to determine what it was when I finished it off yesterday - but it was also tasty.  I will be back, and will be dreaming of that green salsa until that happens.

Ended up coming here only after discovering that Carlsbad across the street had a 20 minute wait.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  It was a Sunday, and they still had happy hour rocking at the bar.  We pulled up a chair, had great conversation with the other patrons and then the food came...  I lived in Seattle for seven years - so to impress me with seafood in Arizona is few and far between.  That said, the scallops here may have been the best I've ever had.  We also got the wings, which were solid, as well as a couple other appetizers that I can't remember, but did not disappoint.  The service was awesome, and come to find out they share a kitchen with another joint in the same plaza.  Any time this happens I'm kind of impressed - especially when the speed of food coming out is exactly as expected.  I'll certainly be back, and look forward to hearing more stories about the origin story... I'm a sucker for tales of Italian fellas in witness protection!

Old town... karaoke... cold drinks... I mean I really don't think there are many establishments that can offer these three things every single night of the week.  For that reason, despite the drastic need for updating / polishing of ambiance / décor, they deserve four stars.    You know that scene in Swingers when they go to The Dresdin?  And the old couple is singing 'Stayin' Alive' on purpose?  Yeah - it was a lot like that - except the older folks singing weren't paid to do so and the crowd was a healthy mix of 21-90.  We showed up around 7'ish on a Sunday night smack dab in the middle of the older clientele rocking out.  Now, I had never seen a collection (like 30) older people care less about what anyone thinks regarding their singing voice.  This was kind of a treat in the people watching arena.  I heard songs I have never heard, nor want to hear again... I saw legit bell bottoms and junk grabbing like I haven't seen in years... They were flirting and dancing and drinking - and then about an hour later I saw the coffees start arriving at their tables as the songs / karaoke shifted to the younger folk.  Most of them shuffled out at that point, but some stayed to witness songs THEY'VE never heard and thus I got to witness a karaoke dichotomy that I'd never seen before.  The service was good, the prices were higher than average, ('cause Old Town)... but the evening was a success and based on living less than a mile away, I'm sure we'll be back many times going forward.  Great job Grapevine!

There is very little to say about this joint that has not already been said, but I can see why there are close to 700 reviews with almost a perfect rating.  It has been on my list for years, and yesterday I had the chance to have a late lunch there - I'm so glad I did!  There are a few Italian deli / markets around town, but by far this is the best one I've been to.  Of course they have a nice selection of Italian imports that will help make your meal the best it can be, but walking past the counters seeing the menu I knew I was in for a treat.  I went with a sandwich, since it was my first time, which was easier knowing my girlfriend would order the shells and cheese with a meatball on the side.  I got the Il Purista - it just made sense.  Fresh basil, mozzarella, prosciutto, tomato and topped with a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar - it was perfection on a deli roll.    The shells / cheese / meatball / fresh tomato sauce were everything you'd want in a bowl... the ricotta was hands down the creamiest and freshest I've had the pleasure of eating.    Topped it off with a beer and a healthy serving of Italian nostalgia for a lunch that everyone in Phoenix should have at least once.  I did notice that they cater for large groups / events and this will be on a short list in case I ever need anything along those lines.  GO HERE and enjoy!

I just think that this place oozes awesome.  It's tough to beat a huge warehouse turned brewery / Irish themed establishment.  I was merely there for happy hour, but was able to get the cheesy bread w/ marinara and a few lovely pints of their Hop Knot I.P.A.    Anyone wanting to check out a brewery should start here - this is the epitome of that here in the Phoenix area.  I've been to SanTan in Chandler but won't be going back there for a number of reasons.  I don't know if the parking is something that can be fixed, but that's really the only drawback I can think of - oh - that and the guy is a Vikings fan.

Came here last night, and between the pitcher of Hop Knot - which is probably my favorite local IPA and the salmon BLT - it was an evening of excellence.  I'm far from a seafood snob, but I have avoided it for the most part since I moved here from Seattle for obvious reasons.  But their blackened salmon BLT might be my new favorite sandwich in town.  Perfect seasoning, fresh veg and one of my favorite beers to wash it down.  If you haven't tried this sandwich and you're even a small fan of salmon, add this to your list!

Cool ambiance, great bread, little skimpy on the meat, but overall quite a tasty sammich.  The Golden Grahams / Cocoa Krispy treat was a pleasant surprise, and it was "kool" that they offer a few different flavors of Kool-Aid and Tang in the beverage area.  I suppose I wasn't blown away, but that's probably due to all the hype this place garners.  I'll go back, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.

I cannot support this store enough.  Sure you might be able to get your kit and ingredients cheaper through another website, but you will NOT get the 1 on 1 guidance and direction that comes by visiting these fellas.  They are incredibly friendly, and always have a good recipe on hand to suggest or recommend.  You can get everything you need for brewing beer or wine here, including specific and special ingredients that you might want to experiment with.  I will always recommend them and support this beautiful local business.  The only suggestion I would add is that they offer labels for the DIY brewer... luckily I've got a guy!  If you are even considering home brewing, come here and chat with them, they are excellent!!

I don't think I'm alone when I say that every time I go to an Irish pub I'm hoping to see a leprechaun.  Or at the very least some of his Lucky Charms... The only reason Rula doesn't get a 5 is the amount of time we waited for drinks / food.  Granted, we were there on a Sunday during the Tempe Arts Festival - but that' no excuse for drinks taking 30 minutes and food taking more than 75.  We got the Irish Dip with fries & the American Sliders - both were tasty and worth ordering again.  I took a peek at the back patio, which I think would be amazing with a group of friends.  This area of Tempe has LOTS of choices, so I might not be back right away, but if I'm in the area & am craving Irish cuisine / beverages / music, I'll come back fo sho.

I've driven past this place many times, and I always thought it kind of felt out of place on Mill.  I'd heard mixed reviews, and obviously it isn't super popular here on yelp.  But when I saw the Living Social deal (two drinks, any appetizer and any two entrees) it was time to try them out.  Upon arrival, got a nice quick tour of the building, with a little history of the oldest building in Tempe by the host who sat us, thought that was a nice touch.  We were there a little early, so we successfully brought down the demographic as most of the patrons were quite older.  Granted, it was game night @ ASU so I'm sure that had something to do with it.  Started with a couple of drinks and the blackened prime rib appetizer which was tasty - even though I prefer my prime rib medium... the creamy horseradish sauce was bomb.  For entrees, we got the seabass and porterhouse, as they were the most expensive items available.  And as it turns out, they were both spectacular.  Perfectly cooked, amazing presentation and excellent service throughout.  The sides were mashed potatoes and chipotle mac & cheese, both really tasty.  The GM stopped by a couple times to check on us, and was quite cordial.   All in all, it was a really nice meal, and much better than expected.  I had enough left of the porterhouse to make a perfect steak and eggs Sunday breakfast, so that's always a nice bonus.  As far as steakhouses in the area, this place is 2nd only to Durant's in my book - which says a lot.

Legit - mostly due to the atmosphere and excellent food.  I've been meaning to check this place out for quite a while - just needed a good excuse to celebrate.  The only time I cannot fathom loving this place is when it's too warm to enjoy the patio.  There's even a mascot!  We were visited by the official cat of the House Of Tricks and even though I'm not a big cat guy, this one was really sweet.  The cocktails were delicious and everything we ordered was really tasty.  The service was superiors and I only hesitate to give five stars due to price - this was not a cheap meal.  I think between the four of us it came to about $350.  Granted, we didn't hold back, and we were celebrating, but that's still rather steep.    It's tough to say whether or not I'll be back, but I won't say no if the group decides to do so.

No less than 30% of my measure of a great Thai restaurant is their Thai iced tea.  This place serves it to you in a giant glass and lets you mix the tea and cream yourself - which is just fun.  Add to this nice quick service and a simple delicious menu and you've got a winner.  I am a sucker for Pad See-Ew with pork and this was a nice ratio of noodle / veg / protein - I had enough to take home for later.  I got it "Thai hot" which is like five stars or something, it was just right.  I will be back without question and recommend this to anyone who needs a Thai fix.

I have been here a number of times.  The service is always just ok (as in, most of the wait staff just always seems meh), the food is better than ok and the ambiance is what sells this place completely.  It has a pretty sweet wrap around patio / deck that is dog friendly, and the interior is just so cozy and kitschy that you can't help but enjoy yourself.  There is always an atmosphere at an Irish pub that cannot really be explained - and this place is no exception.  Yes, I tried their oysters, and they're tasty.  I especially enjoy it because it's near Mill, but not pretentious or trying too hard like most of Mill Ave tends to do.

Went here for a team lunch yesterday to celebrate a couple birthdays.  Easily in the top five Mexican chains here in the Phoenix area.  Fresh chips and salsa, and they also bring a really tasty bean dip to the table while you're waiting for your food.  Our table ordered the nachos and the queso fundido (jalapeno cream cheese dip) and both were nice.  I got the chicken enchiladas suizas - which was covered in tomatillo sauce.  The beans and rice were spot on and the enchiladas were nicely seasoned.  So, this is a good standby - I won't be in a hurry to get back, but it's a solid choice if you're craving Mexican food.

Last night was my 2nd time dining here, and it was glorious.  Starting the night off by walking in through the kitchen always reminds me of GoodFellas, and that's a good thing.  I happen to like the old school signage / decor, it adds character to a restaurant that has been in the same spot for 60+ years.    They were busy, so it took a while to get drink / appetizer orders, but it wasn't unreasonable.  The only appetizer we got was the spinach-artichoke dip, and it was one of the best I've had.  My wife, my muse, got the wedge salad and it was fresh and also delicious.  I shared the 48 oz. porterhouse with my friend, and let me say that when a hunk of meat that big comes to the table you have to just appreciate the art that it takes to cook it so perfectly.  We got the mushrooms and the potatoes au gratin on the side, which were ideal compliments.    After getting the rest of what we couldn't finish to go, the waiter recommended the strawberry shortcake.  We were all full, but the four of us split - and was quite possibly one of the finest and tastiest desserts ever.  The only drawback, in my opinion, are the tiny, outdated bathrooms - but that's not a dealbreaker.  This is not a cheap night out, but if you have a friend in town and want a great steakhouse, this place can't be beat!

Legit.  Love the decor, great service, fresh ingredients and clever layout.  I had the signature burger and a flite of three beers.  We got a few sushi rolls, and it's easily the best sushi I've had in Arizona.  The fries came out in a freaking tiny shopping cart - AND they came with fry sauce!  For a fat kid who grew up in Idaho / Utah, this is an absolute staple when it comes to fry consumption.  The only reason this place doesn't get a 5th star is, the signature burger, while tasty, came out with a grease soaked bottom bun.  This leads to the sog-factor, which is a texture I find intolerable in the burger kingdom.  I'm sure it's not easy to make a burger patty WITH bacon mixed in non-soggy, but maybe a grilled bun, or some lettuce under the patty would help with this.  Either way, I will be back, and look forward to it!!

So yesterday I'm in CenPho and pull out my handy dandy yelp app... I see reviews from Reese / Moanz / Samantha for this place less than a block away and it made my decision VERY easy.    It's a cool old house, and probably not a place I would ever stop if not for the amazing reviews (which were spot on by the way).  Within fifteen minutes I was enjoying one of the best pizza pies I've tasted in Arizona... and the gorgonzola almost threw me off.  I'm glad I went with my instinct, the pie was perfectly cooked and the flavors were out of sight.    Add to this an ice cold bottle of Peroni - and I was quite pleased with my decision.  Between this and Pomo, I'm convinced that it's the best couple of pies within a half mile anywhere in AZ.  COME EAT HERE!  You won't regret it.  Also, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but if you like Nutella, you must try their Nutella crepe... it's pretty freaking tasty!

So we were going to a show at Stand Up Scottsdale - and pulled our our trusty yelp app trying to find something within walking distance.  ZuZu was close enough that it was worth trying.  It took us a while to figure out how to get in (located near the lobby of the Valley Ho hotel) - but once we did, I had to shake my head as I thought I was stuck inside the movie Casino.  The decor / ambiance looked almost exactly like DeNiro & Sharon Stone's house in Vegas.  This instantly calmed me - much like warm milk.  Even though we only had about a half hour, the waitress made a couple spot-on recommendations (Beef Stroganoff & Pork Chop) - and after checking in on yelp we even got a free glass of house wine!  I'm not often in Scottsdale, but will be back due to the delicious food and retro ambiance.  Well played ZuZu, well played.

This was my first time at either the Red Owl OR Club Red, and I will say I was not impressed with either.  I pulled up and the cops were swarming Club Red, no idea why - but that was a nice welcome.  My good friend and co-worker was playing at the Red Owl, hence the visit.  It was an "all ages" event, so drinks were only allowed on the worst half of the venue - which was the 2nd "nice" welcome.  While my friend did a great job, the "security" seemed more than necessary - and overly aggressive based on the group on THAT side of the joint.  Long story short, the service wasn't great, the venue was outdated and somewhat contrived - and if not for the cute, curly haired bartender, this would be one star only.  Don't bother!

I really liked it - and didn't get a chance to try anything more than the pork and a nibble of sausage as I was there for lunch and was kind of in a hurry.  The service was solid and everything I tasted was delicious... I just wanted a slightly bigger portion.  I realize they bring out free cornbread when you get there, and free tiny doughnuts when you leave (both are really good) - but you come there for MEAT!  I also realize it was a 'lunch portion' - but for the prices I wanted more bang for the buck.  The only side I tried was the mac n' cheese, and have nothing bad to say about that either.  I think the solution is to go for dinner and maybe try the sampler where I can leave satisfied.  I'll be back if I'm ever in the area!

So I lived in Brazil for a couple years, and up until coming here, had never been to a sub-par Brazilian restaurant.  The only other place I had been in this area was Fogo de Chao - which was pricey, but incredible.    I imagine going to this place for lunch, would be okay.  It looked like you could get out of there for around $15 for lunch.  But for two dinners, two cans of guarana (Brazilian soda) and tip, it was well over $100.  Let me say that the quality of food & service would have been more reasonable in the $40 range.  The cheese bread (pao de quejo) was amazing - but it's impossible to screw that up.  The salad bar was worse than Sizzler.  I couldn't believe that rice & beans weren't available in the salad bar area, and all of the "prepared" salads looked like they were scooped out of a pre-packaged bin.  The grilled pineapple was good, and the picanha (sirloin) was decent - but overall the meat selection was poor, and many of the pieces were dry and overcooked.  I guess when you spend $100 for a night out with the wife, you expect great service & to leave satisfied.  It just didn't happen here.

We were staying at the Westin Kierland, and this was simply the highest rated restaurant we could walk to - and walking was necessary because we drank a huge bottle of champagne in the room prior to beginning our adventure.  The hostesses sat us up on the rail - allowing us to watch the kitchen - which was really incredible.  We ordered a couple drinks, then shared the shrimp appetizer - which was both sweet and spicy.  Then, we noticed these tiny millionaire tacos that another guest had ordered and our mouths started watering.  The chef noticed, and totally made one for us on the house - which rarely happens.  They were amaze-balls, and something everyone should put in their mouth.  The main course was pork three ways - and the pork belly was good enough to slap yo mama.  Holy pig.  Seriously, some of the best pork we've had to date.  The other two were good as well, but that damn pork belly.  Phew.  For dessert, which we really didn't have room for but couldn't say no based on how perfect the rest of the meal was, was their chocolate cigar.  Just get this dessert.  Do it.  Actually, I would recommend everything we tried, and would especially recommend sitting up where you can see all the magic happen in the kitchen.  Well done deseo, we'll be back fo sho.

I came here with a regular over the weekend and really enjoyed it.  Granted, I wasn't sober when I arrived and surely didn't remain sober while there.  But, on a Saturday, when the work is done - there's nothing wrong with that.  The bartender, who was fantastic, recommended the Cuban sandwich - which was on special.  My buddy swore up and down that the bacon bleu cheese burger was spot on.  So, like any respectable men would do, we shared half and half.  The only negative on the burger was that the bun wasn't worthy of every other ingredient.  Some times the meat and cheese are so perfect, that an ordinary bun takes away from the delish factor.  The Cuban, while good, was very messy.  When sandwiches are finished in a press, I expect there to be minimal mess.  That said, the pork inside was roasted to perfection and the pickles were tasty.  Add to this a couple of delicious micro-brews and it was a very nice surprise.  I will be back, and would recommend trying this joint to anyone in the area!

I got the gyro and the green fries "great fries + feta cheese & their ranch" - which I would recommend to anyone with a mouth.  The service was good, but not great.  The gyro meat was tender, and tasty, and I will definitely be back to try other items on my international food bucket list.

If you dream of sipping a beer inside what appears to be some old couples home - THIS is the place for you.  I met up with a great friend here and was convinced we were barging into someone else's house when we opened the door...... but it's quite nice.  Very eclectic, and cozy.  Nice selection of beers, prices are reasonable, and the banter was lively.  There was even a short film in production (I use this term loosely) while we were there, and a couple of my rogue suggestions were actually implemented.  Everyone in town should stop here at least once and take it all in, this is a very cool and unique joint.

Transcendent.  Sublime.  Exquisite.  Delightful.  Not often enough in life do you get to use words like this simply to describe a meal.  Thank you Binkley's & Restaurant Week for allowing a simple dude like me to experience the beauty of this incredible establishment.  I tried to think back to the number of times I had spent $40 on a bar tab or a sub-par meal + drinks in the last six months, and it was too many to count.  Here, for $40, I had one of the best five meals of my life.  The website said four courses, but with all of the surprises and treats there were no less than fifteen different tastes.  It was a carnival - not just for the mouth either.  The attention to detail and presentation is second to none.  I am talking about a jaw dropping gastronomic experience.  Twas my first time trying many of the items on the menu - but I shant go into many details because I would simply try anything prepared in that kitchen.  Every single bite had me closing my eyes and letting the food or drink take me on a tiny journey.  Kevin Binkley - take a bow sir, you are a master of your craft and I am honored to have dined in your establishment.  I will spend a moment talking about the tea that was cooked in a vacuum over a bunson burner... the vessel on top had mint, Meyer lemon, hibiscus and a touch of sugar - once the water was boiling it was sucked up with the ingredients and then slowly dripped back into the tiny teapot.  I have never in my life said "wow" for tea - until last night. #science  The dessert was a white chocolate semifreddo (fancy ice cream) and came with a yellow curry oat streusel topped with caramel chocolate sauce........ how many times have you tasted curry and said, "man I wish someone would put that in a dessert!"... it was one of my favorite bites of the entire meal.   So if you want to: ooh / ahh / drool / moan / gasp / sigh or if it is your last meal in Arizona, this is where you should go... simply as good as it gets.

So the place has Christmas lights, and a fair amount of ambiance, and supposedly there's a shirtless shot at 1:00 - which might make going back worth it.  Other than that, the service was less than lackluster, the domestic kegs all seemed flat.  In other words, go somewhere else unless it's 1:00 and you want to see some daytime nudity.

Listen - this joint is exactly what you have come to expect.  The service is reliable, the beers are always cold and it's the only place other than Mexico that I consistently enjoy Corona.    Their food is good, especially their mini chimis and quest dip - and the ambiance never disappoints.  Dining / drinking outdoors is one of my favorite things about Arizona - and for like 8 months out of the year, this is one of my favorite places to go to happy hour.  Can't go wrong - you'll never be blown away by anything, but it is always consistently better than average!

What a pleasant surprise this was.  We had ventured to this part of Tempe to finally visit The Crepe Bar, but sadly it was closed for the holidays - so this was the closest joint with solid reviews & we went for it.  Instantly wary when you're the only couple dining in a new place, but it was the day after Christmas - and an odd time, so we didn't think too much of it.  Here are a few tips:  MUST.GET.GARLIC.KNOTS!  I've had too many greasy bread-sticks in my day, this was nothing like that - and came with a nice cup o' marinara to dip them in.  Also, get the baked ziti - it's a cheese-splosion.  Fresh mozzarella, ricotta and delicious baked goodness.  We also got the veal parmigiano - which was just spot on.    Great service, reasonable prices, and shockingly authentic and fresh... we will be back for sure!

We've been wanting a new cal king mattress for some time.  The last one we got was in 2006, so we were due.  When we walked in we really had zero intention of purchasing, and after looking at the prices we were even more certain we'd end up buying on one Costco.com or something.  After testing a few, the boss found one that she liked and then the conversation got serious.  The salesman did some aggressive price matching based on similar models that we pulled up on our phone, and after ten minutes or so, we had made the purchase!  The delivery was supposed to come yesterday, but their delivery truck had a problem, so they called today to let me know that they would be refunding the cost of delivery for the inconvenience and I will have it this evening.  I won't be purchasing a mattress any time soon, but am impressed with their customer service and will happily recommend this location to anyone.

Goodbye Movembeard!!  Andre did a great job - and the shave / haircut was a nice experience.  The shave had many different steps, and most of the product used was pleasant.  Due to the price, this is something I'll likely only do once a year - but I'm sure that's somewhat common.  I wish that certain things would've been done ie: nose hair trim, eyebrow trim, ear hair trim - but I'm sure that some guys would rather handle that kind of thing on their own.  All in all, it was a great experience and I will likely be back next year on December 1st!

I've come to the realization that if your car isn't under warranty, you should just have AAA.  This is the 2nd time I've had a membership, but yesterday was only the 1st time I needed to use it.  The tow truck showed up on time, got my car started, determined that it was probably just a dead battery - and easily could have suggested we replace it as he had one with him.  This would have been just fine, but he said since he was already there, it would be simple to load it up and have it taken to their repair center for a free diagnostic.  I agreed, and it ended up only being a dead battery.  What I enjoyed about yesterday was the little touches they do to add value.  Nice cold bottle of water for the ride over... lunch suggestion (which was pretty good) while I was waiting... discount on the battery itself... there just isn't much peace of mind when your car is starting to fall apart, and having these guys as a security blanket rocks.  Keep it up fellas!

It was a few weeks ago and I was looking for a place to watch the Seahawks game.  I checked online and certainly didn't want to drive all the way to Scottsdale to the Skeptical Chymist, so this seemed like a great compromise.  I got the Irish breakfast and a Harp lager, and the food was decent.  The service was attentive, which remained impressive when the entire place was packed with Hawks fans.    It was a great environment to watch the game at, and they do a raffle / prizes to keep it interesting and entertaining.  I will be back and would recommend it to any fellow member of the 12th man.

I came here for lunch, got the calzone and an IPA - thought I had been whisked to a ski lodge.  I suppose I was most impressed cause there aren't many joints in town with décor / ambiance like that.  The calzone was really good, the beer was nice and cold and the service was friendly and prompt.  I wasn't necessarily blown away by anything, but it exceeded expectations for a lunch stop on a whim.  I think I'll have to come back for a happy hour, I'm certain it's more fun when it's packed!

Solid all around - I've had their carne asada smothered burrito as well as their tacos and breakfast burrito... all were authentic and tasty.  The service was good and so were the chips and salsa.  I don't have anything super clever or original to say about this joint, most of the time if I'm in the area I hit up Los Taquitos.  That said, this is a solid option and nothing I tasted wasn't good!

So, I've been to Whole Foods before - and it's always a visual treat.  Great selection, fresh, natural foods, lots of beautiful & healthy soccer moms strutting about - but last night was the 1st time I visited their Watering Hole.  Immediately, I was impressed with the selection of craft beers on tap, and stumbled into a couple Thursday specials that I appreciated.  My low rating, this time, is for the idiot bartender and his poor service.  Here's the thing - I get it - you are kind of a hippie if you work at Whole Foods.  But a condescending British hippie is not what I need after a long day at work.  Once again, the beer was tasty, the place was clean, the prices were reasonable, but the service was intolerable.  Don't insult my country, don't insult my country's past-times, and don't insult my intelligence by thinking you've gotten one over on me without my knowing.  To the GM of this particular location - find yourself a bartender who isn't a jerk and I'll come back for sure.

A couple of friends had recommended this place, so we finally gave it a shot.  The prices on the menu kind of punched me in the face - because it was hard to believe that anyone gets away with charging that for Mexican fare.  I ordered the enchilada trio, which was immediately forgettable.  The chips and salsa were just okay, and te waitress did a so-so job.    The fun began once we were lured to the bar with the "Three Amigos" promo drink (after the meal).    Basically, it's their house margarita, with a Coronita tipped in from above, and a Hornitos tequila sidecar.  This kind of got my night started on the right foot.  A few more of the house 'ritas once reverse happy hour hit, and we were finally happy.  In other words, no reason to go there for the food - but the bartender is great and the beer flows like wine.

I'm quite sure that we stopped by this joint at just the right time on a Friday afternoon.  Not too many hipsters, not too many students and the right blend of randomness.  The interior design is kind of a modern / do it yourself type of vibe - which is quite unassuming and warm.  I instantly liked it because I found out not only do they have awesome coffee, but they make their own craft beer.  I ordered a flight, offering a sample of all they have on tap and really enjoyed what they had to offer, especially the Desert IPA.  They have tons of space to stretch out and open up your laptop, and the service was quite friendly.  A little bit of people watching and we were on our way next door to Casey Moore's.  Definitely a worthy place to stop by for a beverage!

Not only had I never heard of this chain, since it's kind of tucked away, I didn't know it was so close to where I live / work!  My friend Kyle is leaving soon to move back to the great Northwest and invited the roomies out for a steak night.  We arrived and I immediately enjoyed the ambiance.  Dark stone walls with fire sconces and low lighting, perfect for a steakhouse.  Our server was friendly and we decided to get the shrimpcargot as an appetizer.  This tasty dish has shrimp, butter & garlic - in an escargot platter with baked Havarti cheese on top.  The combination of flavors make this one of the finest shrimp appetizers I've ever had!  **IF YOU'RE HERE, ORDER LIKE THREE OF THESE, you won't regret it**  Decided to go with the famous French dip as an entrée and that did not disappoint.  The fries that came with were shoestring and perfectly crispy.  The side salad was fresh and delicious - and I had 1/2 of the sandwich to take home for lunch the next day.  I'll be back and will likely get the same exact meal because everything was spot on!

We went to this place last night for AZ restaurant week.  Believe it or not, it's surprisingly classy for a strip mall restaurant.  The service was great, and the menu filled all of us up despite the smaller portions.  I had the chop salad that had chunks of their delicious home made bacon that I will definitely go back for.  Then, the pork tenderloin with shrimp fried rice for my main course, then their wine infused sorbet trio for dessert.  Well done Cork, we will be back!

We were the only customers, which tends to make one a tad nervous, but the service and food did not disappoint.  We got the fried wonton - and it might be my favorite Thai appetizer ever... chicken / peas / corn / carrots in tiny fried wonton triangles with a sweet orange dipping sauce - just wow.  I got my stand-by Thai dish - the Pad See Ew with pork, which was equally tasty.  Simple, fresh ingredients make all the difference, and this is right up there with the best Thai I've ever had.  Never a bad thing when you can get a nice cold glass of Thai iced tea to wash it down.  Well done!!

Ended up here on a Saturday night after a long day of solid drinking... and it continued nicely here with some karaoke.  I can't speak to the food here because we didn't order any, but the service was solid and the drinks were nice & cold.    The karaoke host was great and the selection of songs was vast.  I like that they had a couple of books to look at and choose your songs from - sadly the last few times I went it was just luck of the draw whether they had the song you wanted to sing.  I'll be back, and next time I'll try the food!!

This is the 3rd year I've worked right down the street from this place, and this morning I'm trying their mocha smoothie.  Normally I get the Blimey Limey - but needed some caffeine today and this is just delicious.  The service is always friendly, and even when they're busy they manage to pump out the drinks quickly.  I'm somewhat partial 'cause I have a guy on my team who is addicted to these, so when I'm craving one it normally gets delivered straight to my desk... if you like smoothies, you'll dig this joint.

Came here for lunch today - seemed to have a great overall rating so figured it was worth a shot.  I ordered the open face chicken parm sandwich, and got a butterscotch cookie for dessert.  The chicken was moist and well cooked, smothered in mushrooms, spinach and fresh parmesan cheese.  It was really tasty and just the right amount of food.  The cookie was fresh and the butterscotch / coconut combo was just right.  I was able to sit outside and aside from being hassled by some incredibly aggressive birds, it was a great lunch experience.  Their breads and pastries looked really good and I can definitely see going back for something else.

Food = delicious Ambiance = meh Service = meh Value = meh  Started with the arancini (Italian rice balls) - this was our first time and they were delicious.  For the main course we each got the veal (the lady got the picatta - which was served with capers and a heap o' brocolli, I got the parmesan, which was yum-tastic and served with penne and their fresh marinara).  The ambiance felt a little tacky - with the exception of some very unique posters advertising some of their specials and promotions.  The service started off okay, a nice older gentleman who had the coolest Italian accent.  More than a couple times we went thirsty with empty glasses, but the weirdest part came at the end of the night.  When you dine with other couples, it's not out of the ordinary for said couples to pay individually.  This only becomes a problem when the bill comes hand-written and the waiter can't read his own chicken scratch.  It's not good to end the evening making the customer feel like they're putting you out trying to separate things.  So a few drinks, an appetizer and two main courses came to $80 with tip - it's just a shame that it ended on a somewhat sour note.

When it comes to cars, especially foreign cars, it's nearly impossible to find someone you can trust.  I've been to two of the three locations in town and every time I'm treated with respect and honesty.  Owning a BMW is an expensive choice once your warranty runs out, so having a shop like this is comforting.  I won't EVER take my car back to the local dealership for that reason.  Great job fellas, keep up the good work!!

I've had this twice - once my friend, the penguin, brought some over - and then Saturday night we actually dined there.  The pasty itself tasted much better eating there - probably because it didn't have time to get soggy.  But the side dish, the broccoli and cauliflower smothered in bread crumbs and cheese is LEGIT.  Very unique concept, and the crowd is very hipster / bohemian - which always makes for good people watching.  I'll be back fo' sho'!

Sadly, I think this place is suffering from "I don't know what I want to be" itis.  In the past, we've gone for the happy / reverse happy hour and had great experiences.  But, Saturday, unfortunately, it was just not good at all.  It was 9:45 PM, on a Friday, but since they didn't close until 11 I figured we were ok.  The only empty table that was clean was at the sushi bar - which looked nice due to the enormous fish tank.  Sadly, that's when the nice part of the evening ended.    Immediately after sitting down, one of the sushi chefs started breaking down / cleaning the entire bar whist mean mugging us and the rest of the patrons.  I then realized I couldn't even hear myself think.  Between the sauced people in the lounge, to the house music blaring overhead, I thought, for a moment, I was stuck in an over-priced lounge in Vegas.  Our waiter, who I'm pretty sure was an extra on the Jersey Shore, took our order and it only took twelve minutes to deliver the drinks.  Then, two of the three sushi rolls that were ordered made it to us, along with completely un-seasoned sliders and greasier than it should've been flatbread.  A manager noticed my sad face and asked what was wrong, after explaining it to him (I think he heard me) he came back with $6 taken off the tab for the grease.  It was a nice attempt at saving face, but not enough to right the sour note.  Alas, KG, we will not be back.

We live about a block from here, but for whatever reason I had avoided stopping for the longest time.  Not because of the location as much, but because I hate the Chicago Bears.  So, when I saw a Groupon pop up, I figured I'd give them a shot since they were so close.  On the night we went, they were fairly busy - our waitress was overwhelmed, so my poor rating has little to do with the service.    I ordered the special, which was the tortellini trio - based on the waitress' recommendation.  It took longer than normal, and once the meals finally made their way to the table, it was one of the worst presentations I've seen.  I'm certain I could've cooked better pasta at home, and the "trio" of sauces that came on the pasta were bland and un-inspiring to say the least.  So, we waited longer than normal, for food that was sub-par, and when it was time to check out, the process took about twenty minutes due to the Groupon.  Groupon is in my opinion great marketing, because it gets people who otherwise would have never stopped (like me) the chance to try out your service.  Combine all of this with the watered down "cocktails" that my wife ordered, with the annoying Chicago ambiance, and here we are.  Don't bother stopping unless you're from the windy city and need hometown validation.

I love a good dog park - and this one has quite a lot to offer.  Lots of bags for the poop, drinking fountain for dogs and humans of all sizes, shade for everyone when it gets too hot - and a separate park for large and small dogs.  Other than that, trying to maintain the grass and keeping it clean are important and neither were a problem here.  While looking for it, I stumbled upon the Japanese Friendship Garden - which I immediately added to my list of places to visit without a doggie in tow.  I will be back!

Just went last night for taco Tuesday ($1.50 fish tacos).  Their fish tacos are way good - make sure you get the corn tortillas.  Until having them here, I've always wanted more out of them.  Too often, tacos are placed into two tortillas - because one by itself typically falls apart.  Not here, they're perfectly cooked - and chewy - so go corn all the way.  Don't forget to get a side order of the refried beans, they're awesome as well.

Gotta say - if not for the speed of the kitchen, this place would get five stars.  Erika - who is one of the prettiest waitresses I've ever been served by, did a great job and the happy hour specials were legit.  The pizza, once I finally got it, was sadly undercooked - but the beer and number of happy hour options trump the couple minor mishaps.  I'll be back for sure!

I love this place - and I love the couple that owns it.  I just went back for the 1st time in a long while today, and they have the soda machine of the future!  It's silly I know, but it's a nice touch.  Their bread is always fresh, and their prices are reasonable (less than $6 for almost every footlong).  I stopped going when their corporate office stopped sending the pastrami - which was hands down my favorite sandwich at the time (consequently, albeit a sandwich they don't sell any more, they called the cold pastrami a "Nuckolsandwich" in honor of my last name).  Their roast beef, turkey, penny club & Italian sandos are bomb.

Decided to go here on a whim because they have a clever name.  Turns out that's really all they have going for them, besides the cold beer.  The food was forgettable, the atmosphere was bleh the service was slow and the decor was like a failed attempt at Applebee's.  Needless to say, I won't be going back any time soon.

We were dragged here with a friend because she was craving seafood.  Unfortunately, the only thing that was better than average was the oyster crackers and the ice water.  The incredibly "fishy" smell punches you in the nose when you walk in, and the crowd is almost exclusively retired.  There's nothing wrong with that - other than people tend to lose their taste buds as they age - that's the only reason I can explain how busy they were.  They're "famous" for their fish & chips.  The cod was no bueno and the fries were soggy.  I'm sorry, but if that's what you're famous for, you better bring it every time!  The service was less than desirable, and it's safe to say I'll NEVER go back.

Does it feel like a casting party for MTV's game show Next when I come here?  Yes, yes it does.  That said, you have to appreciate this joint for what it is: decent food, reasonable drink prices, and entertaining people watching.  I sat with friends for close to 2.5 hours and after tip my tab was just over $10 - that doesn't suck.  Most of the waitresses are nice, and easy on the eyes - so service is consistently average.  They have a plethora of tvs and there is actually sand on the patio, which I guess is kind of unique.  If you're patio bound, you may have to deal with the smokers, but most of them are considerate enough to not be a bother.  Check this place out some time for happy hour - that's your best bet for having a good time.

Gotta be honest, did not expect anything in Surprise to have such a classy ambiance / décor.  My friend and I were here on a Sunday afternoon for a few pints and a quiet place to focus on writing our screenplay together.  The help was quick and courteous, and the Guinness was properly poured and came out at the perfect temperature.  We were here for close to four hours, spent some time out on the porch and ordered some of their fries.  While I cannot comment on their food per se, everything else about this place was better than expected.  If I make it back here and the food matches the rest of the experience I shall bump it to a five.    It should also be noted, that while the majority of the clientele there is exactly who you would expect to be eating dinner on a Sunday afternoon, the live music was specifically catered to that demographic.  He was quite talented, but there's only so much Eddie Rabbit I can handle before needing to escape on the patio.  My kingdom for some Dropkick Murphys!  And, to be fair, that's probably what they play on a Fri / Sat night... just sayin.

I looked no further than Lisa E's review of this place and my mind was made up quite easily.  She was right.  You just can't control the clientele in a place like this, I mean most of us have access to do laundry in our own homes.  The signage was only slightly confusing as it was my first time in a laundromat in probably ten years... but one of the nice ladies showed me the ropes and I immediately dominated the row of washing machines that can handle SIX loads at a time.  Impressive.  It turned out, the nice lady who helped me (who at the time was doing her own laundry) actually worked there.  Not only that, she stayed late enough for me to finish drying my items before closing up shop.  She was quite helpful and deserves a raise.    My only feedback would be two things: 1) ATM - I had to run across the street to get more cash for quarters & 2)in regards to the a/c... with that many driers running, in the summer, in Arizona, and surrounded by that many mouth breathers, yeah, that could use some looking into.  If I had to guess what the temperature was inside (in addition to being quite muggy) I'd say it was easily in the high 80's to low 90's.  Sadly, the only employee who was working did not have access to change the temp - which I found quite strange.  Regardless, this place is legit and as Lisa said, totally the Cadillac of laundromats!

I was lucky enough to come on a $5 Monday for lunch, got the firecracker burger and it was really nice.  The fries were nice and crispy and the brew was ice cold.  Service was good and if I'm ever in the area again (which is rare) on a Monday I'll be back for sure.

I was nervous... getting my first tattoo is something I have been contemplating for a long long time, but going here for that experience was the right thing to do.    The ambiance, I imagine, isn't any different from any other tattoo shop.  It's in a strip mall, and is peppered with amazing people all united in cause.  It hurt more than I was prepared for, but the pain became endearing as the process went on.  Everyone there was polite and friendly, and despite making many changes to the design of the actual tattoo, our artist was friendly and supportive.  I enjoyed it so much I'm already planning my next one and it will certainly be here at High Noon - great job fellas!!

I've owned a Macbook for some time now, but haven't ever had a reason to visit their store.  I have avoided going in due to the high levels of smug - not only from the employees, but also many of the patrons.  There's a general "I'm better than you" feeling at places like this that you can also find at Prius dealerships and many parts of California.  The reason for my visit, was that I needed a software update that could not be downloaded.  Why I thought I would be able to pick this up at a place that calls itself the "Genius Bar" is beyond me, but I digress.  The "genius" took a look at my laptop, and said that I needed to order the update directly from Apple HQ... and then proceeded to tell me that he had no less than three other customers neededing the same update on this lovely black Friday.   I then asked him if he understood the irony of a company who prides itself on having most of it's information in the cloud - but not being able to help that many poor suckers in one day due to their policy, while STILL having the nerve to call themselves geniuses...  So, my suggestion, would be that if you only have ONE software update that requires an actual disk to download, maybe have a few of those in each of your stores.  The good news?  I don't ever have to go back.  Which kinda makes me feel like a genius.

I was in need of a joint that was somewhat close and offered karaoke on a Thursday night.  I had heard about this place from friends, and watched the DDD episode a few years ago.  I hadn't yet gone due to the reports of the long waits for service and higher than average prices.  The valet service is nice since the parking there is tricky, the fellas were friendly and quick when we arrived.  I walked in and immediately was entertained by the idea that people go to The Duce and spend $120 on a pair of sweat pants, which are for sale in the boutique near the front entrance.  Next we wandered over to the bar and realized we had infiltrated a private party, to which we were immediately invited to leave.  Walked past the boxing ring, which I find both awesome and bizarre, and on to the karaoke area.  Immediately I noticed that the other folks there were better than average, which I'll be honest kind of intimidated me.  I ordered a couple of drinks, they were about $10 each and come in a decent sized mason jar.    After I had a few sips, the prices made sense and I had zero buyers remorse (which happens from time to time whenever you're spending double digits on a freaking drink).  The servers were as quick as they could be, as crafting handmade artisan cocktails isn't necessarily easy!  The dj was cranky, but he warmed up to us after a while, and we all had a great time drinking and singing until the place closed down.  I didn't get to experience the food, or any of the other random and cool things there, but I did have a great time, and would recommend coming on a school night to avoid the big crowds and long waits.

Don't worry about the fact that this is in a strip mall, or the Chinatown decor, sit down, preferably near the window & get ready for the show.  I ordered pan fried pot stickers, which were easily the best I've ever had.  Then the fresh mango juice, best I've had since I lived in Brazil & cut the mangoes off the tree.  The spicy pan fried noodles with beef (#34) were flat out incredible.    With prices that are pretty close to what they charge at Panda Express, the food is easily ten times better.  The noodles are scratch made, fresh for every order, and you can watch them slapping & pulling the noodles through the window if you have the right seat.  Go here, even if you order ahead & take it to go.  You won't regret it!

Never before have I lived in an area where Famous Dave's has a happy hour - but theirs is so great.  Their Devil's Spit (hot) sauce might be one of my favorites ever created.  To get six of these little drumstick beauties for $4 is just perfect.  The other stuff here is great too - the brisket, the hot links, the ribs - but I'm a sucker for a nice cheap happy hour & these guys deliver.

1st allow me to disclose - the tickets for the Ben Gleib show on Saturday were free - we got them via fillaseatphoenix dot com.  Upon arrival, it was painfully obvious that it was date night in Scottsdale.  This is not a problem - I enjoy pretty people just as much as the next guy.  But, when you're treated like cattle prior to a show beginning, it doesn't give a good 1st impression.  The "lounge" area is way too small for the size crowd that was there, and rather than being assigned seats, you're given a card (A, K, Q, J, 10 and so forth) and ushered in Southwest Airlines style - we immediately ushered ourselves back out to the parking lot and stood around like a-holes for a half hour until the show was ready to begin.  1st tip / suggestion:  the bouncer & doormen at comedy clubs shouldn't be smug, condescending d*ckheads - merely an observation.  The guy taking tickets was very pleasant - and the wait staff was sweet.  The club itself is decent sized, but the chairs / tables are packed in very tight.  Once the show began, this wasn't a big deal at all.  The host / opener was solid, the Jew who followed him was equally solid, and then the owner came on stage.  I have no problem with people who choose to drink or do drugs.  I don't even care of you do both while you're working - as long as you're not putting others in danger.  But if you're on stage, in front of hundreds of people, maybe scale it back a bit.  Sometimes comics are funnier when they're drunk - but they're RARELY funnier when they act like they just did a pencil sized line off someone's booty.  His material was mostly solid, but his delivery was spotty - and he rambled - which is a little insulting to an audience who knows that half the reason you're up there is because you manage the joint.    Ben Gleib was excellent.  70% of his act was interacting with audience members - one in particular made my evening especially pleasant.  There was a tattooed lady in the front row who just wouldn't shut up - which can just be comedy gold - and in this case, it was.  I didn't really know much about him - other than he's regularly on Chealsea Lately.  Bravo sir, I would never have guessed elk hunting would get that much traction, but it did.  All in all, it was a solid comedy experience & we will likely be back!

Ok, I've been to this place probably ten times.  And most of the choices we're so-so... but recently, I was introduced to their orange creamsicle.  It has two levels of deliciousness, and every time I try one it blows my mind.  It's like the top level has flash frozen fresh squeezed orange juice on it, and the bottom level is the perfect blend of creamy orange goodness.  It's without question, hands down, the best popsicle I've ever put in my mouth.  Go try one!!

Ya know, it's really tough to enjoy a meal when your experience with the hostess rubs you the wrong way right when you walk in the door.  We met some good friends there this past Thursday, and were there to use our groupon.  They have a two year old - which normally isn't even worth mentioning, but that's where it went horribly wrong with the hostess.  For some reason, she looked down on us - and not just because she's taller.  Basically she said they had a table in the back where we wouldn't bother anyone with the "child".  I realize that restaurants such as these are normally quieter, more intimate, less rowdy, so it's not what she suggested, it's how she said it.  Our friend's child happens to be very well behaved, but she assumed we would be a distraction or a nuisance.  The fact that she was a ginger, while not affecting her poor courtesy, is still worth mentioning.  The server was attentive, for the most part, with the exception of drink refills.  I can't comment on the quality of the steak, because everyone I was with who ordered steak ordered it wrong (medium well / well done).  The food, for the most part, was forgettable, and unfortunately, we will not be back.  Luckily it was a cheap night thanks to groupon!!

Listen.  Making people laugh isn't easy.  These folks do it without regard for what is or is not politically correct.  Are you easily offended?  If so, you should move on and find something safer.  If not, you're in for a treat.  While the theater may be the smallest I've ever been to, it's cozy - and you can tell that the performers put a lot of work into making it as funny as possible.  For about the price of a movie, you can see a sketch comedy show that might just make you pee your pants.  Couple of tips: 1.bring something to drink, concessions are not offered & 2. if your rear gets sore easily, bring a stadium cushion as the chairs there just aren't comfy.

1st let me say, that almost every time I've ordered Chinese delivery / take out, I'm frustrated by the service / courtesy I get on the other end of the phone.  Not this time.  The lady who answered was very sweet and helpful.    The food was fresh, I highly recommend the beef on a stick & the Mongolian beef w/ fried rice.  The crab puffs were also tasty and the delivery was prompt as well.  It's not Benihana, but it was the best delivered Chinese food we've had since moving here, so give them a shot!

I stumbled onto this place thanks to Yelp!  My friend and I were enjoying ourselves at a beer festival down the street - and decided that we needed better food than the hot dogs they were serving there at the Venue.  So we strolled in, they had just opened, and we basically had the entire place to ourselves.  Since it was happy hour, we basically ordered one of everything.  No, we weren't sober.  But, yes, we were loving every bite.  The service was equally impressive, and I can't wait to go back for a full meal!

There is nothing bad to say about this joint.  From the service, to the eclectic selection of options, to the fact that they always have a great selection of craft beer to boot.  I've been here at least four times and now that I live nearby, I see myself frequenting at least monthly.    This place gets my highest recommendation & I've never had a bad experience.  It doesn't suck that it's right across the street from Angel's Trumpet either!

Friday was IPA night, which caught my attention immediately.  I got the Bourbon Street burger and added fresh jalapenos (no one does this - which really bothers me.  Most of us LOVE fresh rather than picked / from the jar).  It was delicious, as was the queso dip we shared as an appetizer.  Some dude was there playing guitar and singing, which was a nice added bonus.  Live music is a plus when it doesn't suck.  The service was so-so, I'm not 100% sure she was happy to be there, but the food delivered and we will definitely be back!

If you ask me, it's the best tasting fast food burger money can buy in Arizona.  I usually get the char burger with swiss and bacon - with extra crispy fries & ranch to dip them in.  You cannot go wrong with this meal, the bun is even toasted.  I work a couple miles away and end up going there at least twice a month.  I don't want to ramble, because it doesn't get much better than five stars.

Keeping this one short & simple.  I'm not a huge dessert guy, but they have an excellent variety of flavors, and the service was top notch.  Due to the gelato addiction in our household, we will be back, probably within the week.

I just have nothing bad to say about this place.  Combines the best of all possible worlds and hosts a number of super cool local artists.

Do you want an amazing meal AND feel like you're stepping onto a CW soundstage? Then this place is for you. Chock full of flavor, fresh food & lots of beautiful people. The bananas foster French toast is just - just - words just cannot do it justice.  I also shared their croque monsieur and would recommend that to anyone with a mouth.  Side note, I feel like the hours this place is open corresponds nicely to the hours I'm comfortable hanging out on Mill Ave (that's another story all together).  I will most definitely be back.

I love this man.  The bagel man.  He is incredibly friendly, efficient and makes a HELLUVA bagel.  I've tried almost everything here, since it's in my hood, and the only complaint I have is that they're too busy in the mornings to take phone orders!    The first time I stopped in, I paid for my meal and he looked at me and said "you'll be back"... he was right, but I didn't think it would be the next morning!    It's nice when small businesses like this GET IT - and are able to consistently crank out a quality product within their niche.  Clearly his recipes are spot on, for the bagels and the schmear which are made fresh daily.  If you like bagels, or breakfast, or really personable small business owners, come here - you won't regret it!!

I will preface this review by saying the following: if you are not seeking a natural child birth, the following may not apply to you.  We were, and our experience is best summed up by the letter I just sent the practice, which I have pasted below:  Up until mid-April, we had chosen your practice to assist us in one of the most miraculous moments of our lives, the birth of our son.  We had visited three times prior to our visit on 4/8 and each time had met with Laura Rutledge.  She was a delight, incredibly kind and helpful in every way.  The rest of the staff also seemed genuinely excited to see us and help us navigate this exciting journey.  On Friday the 8th, however, we met with our first doctor: Dr. Brock Jackson.  While we were greeted and he was presentable, we found out very quickly that he hadn't even glanced at our file to learn anything about us, despite our being there a number of times prior.  We didn't necessarily expect a thorough review of our file, but to come in at week 30 of our pregnancy and have your doctor ask if you know whether your child is a boy or a girl is not a great way to make a first impression.   We were willing to overlook this, but shortly after he asked us if we had taken any birth classes.  Once we said we were about two thirds of the way through our Bradley Method classes, the entire tone of our visit changed for the worse.  He then gave us a couple of pointers and explained the rest of the process, before asking us if we had any questions. I asked when might it be a good time to share our birth plan with the practice.  He was dismissive and said we could write it out and bring it in any time.  When I pulled it out and handed it to him immediately, the tone of our visit made a complete shift to annoyed and defensive.  While no words were spoken as he read, the non-verbal communication was off putting to both of us.  Nonetheless, we waited patiently to see what he might say.  While some in the medical community might view the Bradley Method, or other natural birth classes as strange or different, we felt we owed it to our unborn son to learn more about child birth without intervention and how we might be able to do this without pain medication.  At no point in our classes had we been told that we know more than doctors or any medical professional.  We did not present our birth plan in this way, but that is certainly how it was received.    To say we were appalled is an understatement.  To say he handled this situation in an incredibly unprofessional way is putting it lightly.  We did not pretend to know more about this than anyone, but as it was our birth plan, we hoped that our birthing team would be on board to help us achieve our goals together.  Since we did not record the conversation, here are a few highlights: * We must get an IV upon arrival, no option * The doctor may and likely will need to break your bag of waters * The doctor may and likely will need to use Pitocin to augment labor * Under no circumstance can the father catch the baby * Laura must have a fetal heart monitor on at all times * We 'hired' them to help us give birth, lessening this miracle to a business transaction  After prodding, he acquiesced that we don't HAVE to do most of these things, but we immediately knew that this is not the kind of labor we want to have, especially with the slight chance that Dr. Jackson be the one delivering the baby in June.    We have no idea if the rest of the practice feels the same way about natural child birth, but since relaxation and confidence in our birth team was of utmost importance, we simply could not take that chance.  We understand that we are merely one couple navigating a very profitable industry, and we realize that this letter likely will change nothing.  But it WILL help us feel better about how we were treated that day, and hopefully will raise awareness that human beings deserve to be treated with respect when it comes to important matters such as these.  We are incredibly lucky that we found a practice (Dr. Chavira) that was willing to work with us on our birth plan.  We are also happy to announce that at 40 weeks and six days, and after 18 hours of labor, we successfully gave birth to our beautiful son with ZERO medical intervention.

My buddy and I were looking for a late night option last night (around 9:30), and stumbled across this place thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app.  We were seated outside, which was lovely, and we got the bruschetta (the one with pancetta and mushrooms was ridic).  Then we got some of their tomato bisque soup, and the Italian flatbread.  I wasn't crazy about the tuna or the salmon options on the bruschetta, but almost everything else was spot on.  Yes, we dunked the flatbread in the soup - and it was ideal.  Great service, great ambiance, and right across the street from Paleta's Betty - which, consequently, has the best popsicle EVER (the orange creamsicle).  All in all, it was a great night and I look forward to going back and trying their entrees!

This joint had been on my bookmarked list of "gotta try" for quite a few months.  I'm not often in the area, but my buddy's wife planned his surprise b-day party here - so I happily agreed to kill two birds with one stone.  Ambiance is nice, beer was delicious and cold, and the food was great.  The service was solid, and upon finding out that I dabble in home-brewing, he mentioned the ability to come to O.H.S.O. and brew your own with the assistance of the brewmasters.  I was pretty impressed, not many breweries take the time to do something like that - so we downloaded the handy dandy app and were able to see the upcoming dates that were available.  They are currently booked through the end of November, but the concept is so cool that I will check periodically to book a brewing session.  I just love it when you can tell a place has passion for what they do, and this place was no exception.

Well, it took a couple of years, but I found the BEST Mexican food in the Phoenix area (I know, bold statement) thanks to fellow yelpers!  The food, decor, wait staff & value were second to none.  The chips and salsa were fresh and delicious.  For dinner, I got the steak a la chipotle, and Angie got the chicken a la crema.  Both come with fresh tortillas on the side, and the servings were huge.  Mexican rice, refried beans & small portion of fresh cabbage were incredible.  They also both came with fresh, sauteed mushrooms which went perfectly with both dishes.  The only negative I can offer (which was difficult, 'cause almost everything else was perfect) was the fluorescent lighting - no one wants to be reminded of "work" when they're trying to unwind with a nice meal - and the lighting reminded me of that.  Outside of the minor lighting snafu, I have nothing negative to say about this place.  We will be back, soon!

I will keep this short, there was nothing famous about this experience.  Got two pies, pepperoni / mushroom & chicken / spinach - all four toppings had the look / taste / texture as if they'd been pulled out of a can.  The red sauce was too sweet - and this is not what one wants on a savory pizza pie.  Sorry Frankie, not impressed & won't be ordering from you again.  The end.

Frankie contacted me and showed genuine concern for what was an unfortunate experience.  They made it right, and the 2nd batch of pizza I got was tasty.  Thank you Frankie for taking a vested interest in your company's web presence and keep up the good work!

Best. Breakfast. Sandwich. EVER! Don't let the lack of curb appeal turn you off.. the croissant samwich with avocado & Canadian bacon was to die for. I got the dirty iced chai as well, which was a perfect combo. SOOO good, MUST try!

This was my 1st time venturing into the realm of Indian food.  I've always wanted to try it, but it either hasn't been the right time, or there's always been a more comfortable suggestion.  It was time to do so, with a support group of couple co-workers of course.  Did I love it?  Not really.  My sense of taste was confused for a solid 40 minutes as I tried things I never thought I would.   Of course a couple of the items were really tasty.  I could eat their garlic nan bread all the time, it was some of the best tofu I've ever had and the butter chicken had great flavor.  That said, I don't see myself craving it any time soon.  So, great service, very clean presentation and reasonable prices mean they deserve a four, just not sure I'll be back!

What does a guy look for in a wing?  Crispy?  Yes.  Flavorful options?  Indeed.  Healthy size?  Sure.  Kool Aid on the side?  Why not?  Listen, the only reason ATL Wings isn't getting a 5th star today is the fact that we ordered them to go and then waited for 45 minutes.  I think they had a couple people call in sick, or something, but that's just too long to ask anyone to wait with all those smells punching you in the nose-hole.    I tried the Mac n' Cheese bites, they were good.  The Honey Biscuits reminded me of mini-scones from the fair where I grew up in Idaho - MUST ORDER!  I will be back - but you better believe I'll call ahead with my order to avoid the wait.

I enjoyed everything about this place.  I have been to BBQ places before with the 'grab a tray and load up' technique before, but for some reason this one was cooler than most.  I got a side of their green chili stew - and it's just something I could probably eat every day.  For meats I got the moist brisket and jalapeno hot link - both were on point.    Their house sauce was perfectly spicy and the service was friendly and quick.  So far - this is my favorite BBQ in Arizona!  It doesn't suck that it's not all that far from work either - so I'll be back sooner than later.  I didn't spend any time in the country store, but I will probably be purchasing some of their sauce next time I go!

Solid four stars for our first experience at the opolis of Pork.  It's tucked away in the Sam's Club parking lot and despite driving past it numerous times, did not realize it was there.  That said, I listen to Holmberg's Morning Sickness almost every morning so I've been wanting to try it out for some time.  It's smaller inside than you might think, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Our Groupon special came with two of their cocktails, an appetizer, three meat entrees + two sides, and a dessert.  I've only had fried pickles that were better at Hooters - and in my opinion, Hooters frickles are the best thing on their menu.  In other words, get 'em!  The brisket was fattier than it should've been, the pulled pork was spot on, and the ribs were a little dry.  The sides were tasty, I had the mac n' cheese - which had a kick to it that I enjoyed, and the jalapeno coleslaw that tasted nice and fresh.  They were out of the ice cream sandwich that came with the special, but instead they gave us two of the best popsicles I've ever had (see review for Paletas Betty) which ended everything on a high note.  The service was top notch and we will be back to try the other meats!!

I liked this place.  The menu kind of bugged me - in that they don't have anything above the cashier, merely copies of the menu taped to the counter next to the register.  But that has nothing to do with the food.  The chips and salsa were good, as was the fry bread / chimi that we tried.  It's not really close to us, so I won't be going out of my way to eat there - but still a worthy choice.

We stopped here for a bite after watching Le Reve, and really enjoyed it.  We got the pancetta fettucini alfredo - with some of their cheese bread and then a side order of wings.  The wings - were spot on.  The bread, was delicious.  The pasta, was VERY rich - but still tasty.  If you're staying at or near The Wynn, I would definitely recommend this place.  Especially over their crappy buffet!

Don't let the blase exterior (with the exception of the amazing mural) fool you at this joint... it's MUCH bigger than it looks from the outside.  The only food I tried was their margherita pizza, which was fresh and tasty - but far from my favorite.  I will reserve judgment on the rest of the menu items until I try, but their beer selection is just impeccable.  Rotating taps with every kind imaginable, a great happy hour, and friendly service = must try if you love beer.  I really loved the open design, the back patio (especially between October and May) are perfect for this part of Phoenix.  It's like, for a moment, you forget where you are.  Very zen like, and peaceful place to enjoy a drink - at least until they get busy, and then it's still great, just not as quiet.  MUST TRY if you're needing a drink downtown, I will surely be back.

So I have walked past this joint many a time while at Tempe Marketplace, but I never gave it a second thought.  I don't know whether it was the logo or the perception of stuffy hipsters inside - but I'm glad I did.  They have a solid happy hour with specials on drinks and food, the service was attentive and the ambiance was much better than I expected.  Based on the other places I have had a beverage in the vicinity, this place is one of the better options for sure.  Totally worth checking out during happy hour, I have no idea about the standard menu - but if I'm thirsty and in the area I'll be back for sure!

I've been to the other two sister restaurants in the same plaza, but had not yet checked this one out.  It was a weeknight, and they were not all that busy, so it was a good chance to try out some of their popular dishes.    The oysters Rockefeller / chips + salsa were really great appetizers.  It was my first time having oysters that way and will definitely not be my last.  The salsa was fresh and chips were perfectly warm and salted.  For the entrée I got the chorizo pizza - mostly because I like house made chorizo and wanted to give this unique twist on a pizza a shot.  When it arrived on the table, I saw all the fresh cabbage on top and remembered the last time I had lettuce / cabbage on a pizza was the time I tried a taco pie in Idaho - which was an epic fail.  This didn't fail as bad, because it gave the pie a nice crunch / texture alternative.  But the next day, as you might imagine, it didn't quite hold up.  The flavor combination just wasn't ideal and not something I'd order again.  That said, the service was solid and the appetizers were really good so when I come back I'll just try something else.

We went to the old location about 18 months ago, and after visiting their new home, it was a breath of fresh air to be greeted by Chef Hanna  upon arrival.  She is the sweetest and most passionate lady - and it's always an honor to have her prepare food for you.  We brought our appetite, and started with the small order of poutine - which is Canadian comfort food at it's best, eh?  Crispy fries with fresh cheese curds and delicious gravy peppered with parsley - it's just yum.  Then, for the main course, I had the cordon bleu and Angie ordered the schnitzel.  The side items are artfully prepared, I had couscous / potato and dill salad / beet salad for mine and they were spot on.  You can tell that everything is fresh, and no expense is spared in putting her passion on a plate.  It probably wasn't, but the food tasted better this time around, and I'm already excited to go back for the two items she promised: spaetzle and her Beaver Supreme dessert!

I've been trying to get over to Matt's for some time - but since I live in Chandler, it's not often that I'm in Phoenix during breakfast hours.  That said, boy oh boy was it worth the extra 30 minute drive.  Everything was spot on.  The service, the food, the ambiance - just wow.  We got there close to closing time, so they were out of a few things, but that's to be expected when they're so busy.  Probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had - and the pancake is in the top three of all time.  Very few restaurants bother with real maple syrup, but for me it makes all the difference.  The bacon was up near the top I've ever had, and I will be back as often as possible.  Simply put, it's the best breakfast destination in Phoenix, period.

Karen is the best.  Her specialties include therapy for individuals, couples & children:               Anxiety and Depression             Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)             Chronic Illness             Betrayal/Divorce             Grief and Loss             Major Life Transitions  I added her business to yelp because this is something people SHOULD be yelping about.  Great food reviews are nice, but Karen is actually helping me become a better person - which is pretty cool.  I was a complete "Doubting Thomas" prior to spending time with her, but she's sweet, and I would recommend her to anyone.  GREAT JOB KAREN!!

This place is brand new and I was excited to give it a shot since it's right around the corner from where I work.  I ordered two full tacos (fish / shrimp / pepper) for lunch.  They were still installing the security system so they're still figuring things out, based on their website, this is their 1st and only location thus far.  The measures of good corn tortillas for me are: are they fresh and do they fall apart - and these are really good.  The fish and shrimp were fresh and tasty and the cheesy pepper was a nice touch.  The salsa bar is nicely stocked with different salsas / condiments similar to what you'd find in Mexico.  The menu is simple and reasonable - definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood!

4.5 stars........... what a cozy and friendly joint this is.  It has been on my list for months now and yesterday was the perfect opportunity.  I had 1/2 of their breakfast sandwich and 1/2 of their green chile burger, along with my free Nutter Butter for dessert (I love it when business give us a little something for checking in with yelp).  The breakfast sandwich (Flanched Flarney Garney) was just delicious.  The avocado specifically was spot on and totally made the sandwich.  The AZ burger was well cooked, but completely under-seasoned and bland.  I hoped the chiles would help, but they just weren't enough.  I had a pitcher (don't let the name fool you, this is basically two pints worth) of Orange Blossom beer and one of the Farmer's Cup cocktails - both were delicious.  To top it all off, their homemade Nutter Butter cookie was just outstanding.  The light and fluffy peanut crème in the middle was melt in your mouth-tastic.  I will have to come back during the open air market, I really like the vibe and atmosphere here - totally coming back!

Tried both the margherita pizza and the roma salad... both were just absolute perfection.  I can't imagine a world where the flavors or ingredients for either are better.    It was a breezy fall's eve, so sitting outside was the right choice.  Service was great, drinks were cold - and after finishing off the 'za and salad, the chef came out with a taste of his special homemade limoncello.  That's what he called it at least, 'cept it was in an Everclear bottle.    Apparently more than a shot of it could cause liver-failure and diabetes at the same time - 'cause it was deliciously sweet, and thick enough that it coats your throat like lemon flavored cough syrup.    It was a nice touch, and the chef, despite not knowing a ton of English, was very kind.  I will be back to try other dishes, I can't see making a bad choice at this establishment.

Best. Burger. Of 2013... And to top it off, I was there for their Wednesday $10 burger & beer special.  What a pleasant surprise.  You know, we eat every day.  And most days we really don't think twice about it.  But on this day, repeatedly, I had to set the burger down, and just let my taste buds thank me for such a glorious meal.  The fries, in my humble Idahoan opinion, were cut fresh and seasoned perfectly, the patty was the perfect size and the pretzel bun was maybe the best I've ever had.  Add to that a couple pints of my first Jewish IPA (HeBrew Hop Manna IPA - it was Hasiderific!) and I was completely content.  This was my 1st venture to this area of Phoenix, and I found out there's a bar across the street called The Little Woody?  Sold.  I will be back, and it will most certainly be on a Wednesday!

I'm not what you would call a huge fan of French cuisine.  That doesn't mean I can't appreciate delicious when it hits my lips.  I didn't really know what to expect from this place, other than I was fairly certain I could get some duck confit or a croissant.  I was right, but they have a lot more.  Sadly, I came near closing time, so many of their savory options were gone.  But, I was able to snag some of their macaroons and a madeline.  I guess their macaroon flavors rotate all the time, but the blueberry one I had was easily the finest macaroon I've had to date.  Couple this with a very European feel inside & very friendly service, and this was a nice change of pace.  I will go back, if nothing else, to try one of their savory croissants - and possibly some of their other fresh items that frankly wouldn't travel well in 110 degree heat.  This place is unique and if you're in the area, definitely check it out!

I'm giving this place a solid four stars, because between the $5 yelp check in deal + happy hour prices, my burger and beer were less than $10 WITH a generous tip!  The beer was cold, as advertised, and the burger was tasty.  Not the best I've ever had by any means, but a solid cheeseburger worthy of being included in the namesake.  Our waitress was on top of it, despite having what appeared to be ten different groups she was waiting on, and the crowd was a nice mix of Scottsdale randoms.    It's possible that I'm giving the 4th star due to the company I was surrounded by (Rick / Jon / Amy / Jolly / Heath / Laura / Jeff / Becky) - we shared some very interesting conversation as a little sendoff for our pal Rick who was visiting from N.C.  On this day, we learned that there are still people in their 30's rocking aol e-mail addresses... HA!  Definitely worth checking this place out, it's a solid option in old town Scottsdale, especially if you're trying to watch a game!

Went here for the Blue Collar Beer Festival over the weekend with a couple of friends.  I didn't really have much of an expectation for the venue as I'd never heard anything about it.  That said, I think it was a great time had by all.  All things considered, this was the perfect spot for a crowd like this.  I realize that the event itself wasn't put on by the owners of the space, but no one went thirsty, and there were lots of people there, so that says something.   The temperature was nice and cool inside, they got ATL wings to set up shop and sell their delicious yard bird and all was well.  If this event happens again next year, I'll be there for sure.

So here's the thing, I'm a pretty reasonable consumer.  I need to make some home purchases here in the next few months so I applied for credit via their website.  26 seconds after submitting my application, I got a phone call from an area number.  I was quite surprised it was from a salesman that wanted to tell me I had been approved for quite a large credit limit and should come spend my money.  I agreed to come in that afternoon and see what they had.    I was looking for a laptop now, and furniture later and upon walking in, it felt weird.  I was immediately approached by no less than five salespeople assaulting me with questions and their eagerness to help.  I declined, because I wanted to check their prices vs. amazon just so I had an idea.  Immediately, I noticed their beautiful tv display area.  The furniture, also appeared to be quality stuff and reasonably priced.  The laptop I found, with the exact same specs, was $400 less on amazon.  They 'couldn't' price match or flex on the price at all, which made my decision rather easy.  Keep in mind, as the day progressed, I received four text messages from the salesperson, with wretched grammar asking when I was coming in.  This kind of approach couldn't be more of a turn off.    While they have a nice showroom, and a few of the salespeople did actually seem pleasant, my overall experience couldn't have been much worse.  Sometimes it's moments like these that remind us that it DOES matter where we spend our money.    Unless of course you're into being harassed and badgered for overpriced items, in which case this place is perfect!

As an amateur brewmaster, I will always have a special place in my heart for craft beer.  I had heard many good things about this place and just had not had a chance to check it out until last night.  What a pleasant surprise!  I do not remember our waiter's name, but he had a fantastic moustache and took excellent care of us.  We got the super duper flight of all seven beers they had on tap, and he took the time to explain each one.  Of the seven, I really liked five of them - but still appreciate the time and effort it takes to create the flavor combinations.  We also got the Flyin' Belgian Pig in Beer Cheese - which I'll have you know is cooked in duck fat... and just come on.  99% of the time, soggy fries are a lose-lose - but not this time.  Fresh cut fries, beer cheese (yes that's a thing, as it should be) and tender pulled pork.  Needless to say, I'll be back and absolutely love what this place stands for.  Tons of beards, love for the wilderness and passion for great beer.  I will go on a limb and say it is one of my favorite breweries and am completely stoked to go back!

Not only are the birds impressive on your way in, but the giant gate leading to the restaurant through the patio kind of blew my mind.  I was there for a football game with my friend and had heard good things about their beer.  I tried a number of differing varieties, but the one that I liked most was their ginger IPA.  Once I added a squeeze of lime to it, I was inspired for my next home brew.  I love it when beer inspires me, so we were off to a good start.   We got the pizza and the poutine - the pizza was excellent, easily some of the best in the east valley.  The poutine, however, left a lot to be desired.  I remember it being soggy and forgettable, despite the great intentions.  I would go here almost any time over the loud and obnoxious San Tan Brewery around the corner, so I will be back.  Any excuse I can get to hang out in Downtown Chandler means I get Paletas Betty for dessert, which is never a bad thing!

I have driven past this place a few times and had no idea what it was until I popped in  yesterday to check it out.  Comparing to say, Dave & Busters, it has about 30% of the games, but also has a bowling alley and billiards in addition to the food and full bar.  Sunday through Thursday they have free billiards until 7, so of course I took advantage of that with a bucket of beer.  The help was friendly, and the place is still relatively new so everything is clean (for the most part).  I don't think I would come back to pay full price for anything here, but if it's happy hour or a promotion I could swing it for sure.  It's only a couple of blocks from where I work so it's possible this will happen sooner than later.  I munched on the southwestern egg rolls and chicken quesidilla - both were ok but neither knocked my socks off.  Still, totally worth checking out if and when the price is right!

We have a number of different food trucks that roll through where I work on Fridays... Frank is easily the best we've ever featured.  Pretzel buns are no stranger to me, I've had many a sandwich / burger on some of the best pretzel buns man can create.  But I've never had an all beef dawg on an elongated pretzel bun - it was epic.  Topped with lobster mac n' cheese - with dirty chips on the side - I am in food truck heaven.  The service was great, everything was fresh, and the only thing I didn't like was how hard it was to decide what to get.  LE GIT - and for a hot dog of this quality and a side of chips, $13 is more than reasonable.  I will seek them out on their facebook page and definitely be back for more - these guys are doing it right!  It should be noted that the only hot dog I've ever had that was better was up in Vancouver, B.C... but I was so far from sober I'm not certain my reasoning can be trusted.

I don't have a good reason to have avoided this place as long as I have, so when the chance came on Saturday to check it out I was ready.  While I don't necessarily love the name, the menu was exciting - so many things to try.  We got the hummus sampler and then I got the special, which was a Greek enchilada - I totally added feta and kalamata olives (which was an excellent choice).  The rice that came with it had just a bit of cilantro in it and the tzatziki sauce was nice to have on the side.  The hummus was equally tasty and everything was fresh and well seasoned.  I had probably six refills on the fresh lemonade, which made sitting out on the porch that much more refreshing.  The service was attentive and while I probably won't be coming back to this location, I will totally come here again.

I stumbled across this place after a failed attempt at a date - and after opening the door, was immediately greeted by the lovely and beautiful Erika.  She suggested a flight of beers - allowing me to try many of what they had on tap.  I agreed and after my first flight, I figured the best value was in having another one (6 oz. x 4 glasses for $8).  So that's exactly what I did, which was the right choice.  They have your garden variety IPA options, but what impressed me was their Strawberry Field Hef - it wasn't too wheaty, wasn't too sweet, and was quite refreshing.  That said, the beers tasted good, and the grilled ham and cheese, despite being a little too sweet for my taste, was a nice touch.  My advice would be spend some bucks on décor / ambiance and improve the menu slightly - and you've got something.  The brewmaster / owner was in the kitchen making the food, which I always find interesting - but until they get much busier that won't be an issue.  By the time I finished, there were three other couples in there sitting down for a drink - it seemed as if a place like this is well received, and I always love giving business to local brewers - craft beer is my absolute favorite.  I hope this place makes it!

I had a pretty cool idea for a Christmas present, and walked in with kind of an awkward and obscure request.  I spoke with one of the owners, her name eludes me, but she was absolutely helpful and hilarious. The prices were reasonable, and if I ever need another trophy I'll be sure to come here.  They do great work and are great people!

Our employer recently decided to have a rotating selection of food trucks come every Friday, which is a decision I heartily support.  Today was Sweet Magnolia, and I had to try their special: Sunny Side Up - brisket on a bun, with a fried egg on top + a side of coleslaw and mac & cheese ($10).  Decent amount of food and the flavor was good for everything, although the brisket did seem a little over-cooked.  The sauce was good, their homemade coleslaw was just right (I hate it when it's too sweet) and the mac & cheese was decent.  Seems to be a newer, smaller operation than some, but the service was great and the seemed to have a nice selection of choices.  If they come back I'll be trying their ribs for sure, definitely worth checking them out!

What a horrible time yesterday... shYEAH - and monkeys might fly out of my butt!  As always, Lindsey's event went off without a hitch.  It was great to see a few fellow yelpers I knew, and a few more I had not yet met.  Immediately arrived to a drink ticket, Short Leash was outside (c'mon, they rock) and we were all kind of excited to watch a movie with one another.  The previews were great, the service was great, and I was excited when the title came up - as it had been at least 20 years since I've seen Wayne's World!  I had forgotten how many hilarious lines / scenes were in it that I still quote today.  Bravo - what a great time and can't wait for the next one!  p.s. this was my first time visiting Film Bar - and I will most definitely be back, I love the vibe there and they show some pretty sick cult classic type movies there.  Plus, the beer selection is better than you'd expect for a movie theater!

My first time experiencing The Capital Grille was for this event and I was wowed to say the least.  The service was fantastic all night, both at the event and afterwards with some fellow yelpers in the bar.    We got to sample some delicious wine paired with light bites that were absolutely delicious.  I was impressed from the moment I walked in until walking out a few hours later.  Included in our swag bag was a free cocktail / calamari - which I decided to use immediately.    I will certainly be back and have to commend both Lindsey and everyone else involved for such a fancy and decadent evening!!

I've gotta be honest - I was more than pleasantly surprised with this joint.  Right when you walk in you're kind of taken back by the ambiance / retro decor / style of the place.  This is a good thing.  Be different - your consumers will appreciate it!  As far as food goes, I tried the sliders / cheese curds (which were the best goat cheese I've ever had) & the fries - which come with house made ketchup.  All the food items were bomb, and this was the first time I appreciated a sweet pickle on my slider.  Along with that, I got a couple Dale's Pale Ale - since it's one of my favorite brews and ended up leaving incredibly satisfied for less than $50.  Took a walk to the bathroom and got to see the scope of this place, there's something for everyone here (yes, I also pictured Stefan from SNL just now) - but seriously, if you want seafood / Mexican / American / Greek / pastries - you're covered here.    I'll be back and can't wait to try some other menu items!!
