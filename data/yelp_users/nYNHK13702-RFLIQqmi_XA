Came here alone at 1:30am on a Friday night and sat at the counter. I ordered a southwest turkey sandwich and fries. The sandwich was average, and the fries were perfect. The friendly chit-chat between the waiter and the regulars at the counter was amusing enough that I decided to hang out longer while enjoying a slice of hot apple pie topped with whipped cream. The service was excellent! I live close by, so hoping that Jerry's becomes my new late night food stop. Next time, I'll try the breakfast.

Small portions. Overpriced. Tasted okay, but would have preferred some Filiberto's tacos for half the price.
