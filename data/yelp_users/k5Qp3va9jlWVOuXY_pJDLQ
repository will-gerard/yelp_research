Came back after two weeks because I still was sick.  The registration staff was still just as nice and helpful.    Although there was no line, I saw the doctor for approximately 90 seconds.  He said you're back; I told him what was going wrong and he told me his plan and left.    I doubt my co pay and health insurance appreciated such a pathetic effort.     I won't be coming back, there are other places where I'll be seen and treated for a bit longer.

My trip should have been aptly called "Beards and Beer" instead of the "birds n beers."  Apparently I missed out on the typical "sex" themed talks, IE. frog sex, bird sex and flower sex.  Since this was the last event of the year, visitors got a stand up routine about beards from an official Beardo.  Wildly funny and entertaining stand up, the Four Peaks beer might have helped.  Four Peaks provided their main staple beers: Kilt lifter, Hop Knot and Kolsch.  3 styles to meet any palate.    Stop by and you'll meet their passionate staff and some friendly bird n beer enthusiasts.  There's no better way to to unwind after work, and learn a few things about that nature thing outside.

I can't stress how quick the trip was.  It literally took the estimated 15 minutes for an oil change with some typical car checks.  It was nice that they vacuumed the front seats and cleared the desert crust off my windows.  Fair price with a nice smile.  My only complaint is that I'm not a women to take advantage of their $5 off Ladies Wednesday.  Maybe in another life.

Simple quick service.  Stop by, drop off your goods, pay and then you're off.  If you place your order before 9, you can pick it up after 4p.    What more can a peep ask for?  Free of course, but then I'd have to find somewhere new.    Friendly staff, I have never waited longer than walking to register.

I randomly drove by this place only to realize it was a parking lot.  This place has all the  pros of a small home business,  no bureaucracy headaches, so I never waited longer than 5 minutes for the shuttle, and owners who appear genuinely concerned about their customers.  If you really want to save some money, prepay pay on-line.  Of course this only works if you know your itinerary.  Plus they will try to schedule the bus to pick you up.    Admittedly the place looks a bit shadey, and I feared I would have to pick my car up in Mexico.   Ultimately my greatest fear should have been the two haboobs blanketing my car with an inch of dirt.  There is only non covered parking.    I doubt there are any cheaper places to park your car unless you walk to the airport.

SPOILER ALERT!  Don't look at the photo's posted if you want to be surprised when you reach the top.   This is the perfect locale for the lazy hiker or weekender who wants to see the West Valley Phoenix.   You can drive to the top of the mountain in about 25 minutes.  No hiking required.   Be wary of ambitious runners and Tour De France bikers blazing up and down the mountain.  I'm quite certain I nearly left one for road kill on the drive up.  This is probably a fun drive up if you a mid life crisis sports car, other wise make sure to be paying attention as there are many blind turns.  Parking is simple up top, but bring your food and drinks because vendors are banned from the top.  Make sure double check your route because it's easy to get lost.  Reception is terrible driving up, but you will forget about your technology once you reach the top.  Stop by if you want a nice city view and beat the heat in your car.  For those super sporty hikers and bikers there are plenty of trails to wander about  and enjoy the spring bloom.

This is strictly a beer review.  Happy hour looks promising though.  Looking for a man date or a sporty classy bar to escape the fam bam for a few hours?  This Rock Bottom brewery might be a good place start.  I came in at noon, and there were 4 pairs of guys drinking beer and watching ESPN highlights.  Clearly this is the place to go for the midday work lunch with a good guy friend.  Unfortunately the Cardinals got stomped on, so everyone was in a sour mood.  The local patrons were at least friendly to hide their discontent.  For ladies less inclined to drink beer, but want to try something new, I'd recommend the white ale.  For peeps that don't want Coors, get the Kolsch.  For guys, it's tough, but get a taster of the smoked porter and drink the Marzen.   My taster rack was unbelievably inexpensive.  From lightest to darkest:  Kolsch - Light beer good crisp flavor.  I generally don't like Kolsch, but I enjoyed this little taster    Belgium White Ale - Quite good with a lemony floral body and finish.  Best of the bunch.      Red Ale - Not that good, lacked the ale flavor.  IPA  - Dry hoppy, not so good finish and after taste.  Special Dark Octoberfest Marzen - Decent, had some ale taste with  wheaty finish.  Bourbon Barrel Smoked Porter - Served off cask, unfortunately it was warm.  Definitely interesting, I wish it was a colder.  It's like a drinking a light whiskey.  Not very oaky like most barrel aged porters (which is good thing), you can feel the alcohol, but not taste it.  It's odd, but worth trying, just hope it is cool.    The bartenders were quite knowledgeable about their beers, and offered advice to patrons unfamiliar with beer.  I would like to give the place 3, but there weren't any exceptional beers,  just a clear upgrade from the big American breweries.    Stop by if its football Sunday or you want a break from a typical beerless weekday lunch.

Why go red when you can go white?  White sauce that is.    Faily priced, cool mix of ingredient and legitamate 5 minute wait for a couple of slices, what can go wrong?  Get anything with artichoke heart and white sauce, so they can make a believer out of you.  White sauce is not so much a sauce as it is cheese. Obviously more cheese is better than more tomato sauce. The  owner appears to runs the place, and was suprisingly friendly despite how busy he was.  Low key place, so don't bring your hot date, unless she's a die hard foodie since seating is limited and hasn't quite made it to the 21st century.  Tessios is great for that beer pairing or late night munchies.  NOTE if you're picking up a pizza, consider using one of their coupons available online.     Tessios and Taste of Tops seriously need make a love baby, so the Tempe peeps can have their thirst and hunger satisfied under one roof.

Curious what happens when you combine random cuisine with a pizza?  Slices Pizza basically.  You would be surprised how well a salad can be contained a top a pizza.   I never eat salads, so getting the chicken salad pizza was a bit out of my comfort zone.  The pizza was a good mix of chicken chunks and ranch.  The salad was just there.  Do not get the Greek salad, as a meat eater, I need some animal on my food.  The Greek salad pizza just didn't have any distinct flavors to enjoy.  The gyro pizza is kind of odd, get it if you're feeling a bit more adventurous then Hawaiian.  The slices are pretty large, but if you're hungry make sure to get two.    Stop by if you need a quick bite of some Frankenstein pizza and be pleasantly surprised with the results.

Bust out your boxing gloves because you're about to get into a fight.   I'm joking, don't fight because people actually get kicked out.  Still, thank God I'm a guy because the woman's area is a gladiator ring meets the jungle.  The guy's side is a just a busy New York side walk.   The place is always swarming with people, so stop midday during the week.  The men's selection is really hit or miss.  I found a few worthy shirts, only to find two of them coffee stained and inked.     Don't be discouraged when there's a 5 person wait for the men's dressing room, followed by a 10-20 person deep check out line.  The line moves.   Bring your low expectations and work ethic and you'll eventually come out a winner.

No one appreciates Isaac Newton getting hit by an apple, until they they finish their Echo trek up and begin their descent down.      A couple of things I wish knew before hand if traveling on the Echo side.  Bring a bag, or something to carry your water. Peeps say bring water, so peeps bring water bottles.  Half way up the trek, the bottle is a nuisance because you may need your hands.  People find create ways to carry their bottles to say the least.  Unless you're true mountaineer requiring constant hydration with a Camelbak, a track bag + water bottle is sufficient.   Don't bother bringing a jacket, it too will be a nascence, do some jumping jacks before you head out and you'll be toasty.   It is only a 4 stars because it is incredibly busy and parking is terrible.  Thankfully there's Park N hike, costing you  5 dollars.  Park at the  Town of Paradise Valley off Lincoln and Invergordon.  Its a good option for peeps not from the area, so you can get some nice local advice on trails.  Plus you can get a banana to prevent them cramps.  For peeps looking for a fun date, spot, consider going up the Cholla side and parking on the street.  If one of you is not too fit, the Echo trek will be miserable for you both.    I plan to make my millions zip lining peeps from the top to the bottom.  Snapping your ankles on the downward descent could replaced with a soul crushing 2700 foot drop.    Note apparently the Echo parking will be closed after January 12ish 2013, to add  more parking.  I have no idea where to park at that time.

As compared to Camelback, this trek offers easy parking, and significantly lower chances of snapping your ankles.  One notable perk is the greater chance of falling down the mountain though.    This trek is by far a much friendlier, a more pure stair master as compared to the creative rock climbing at Camelback.  For the family visit, date, Piestewa Peak is a better choice than Camelback.  Expect a decent workout with less peeps and much more accessible for the less fit.

Make sure to bring your fist bumping attitude, if you're stopping after a night out in downtown Scottsdale.  They actually have a DJ blasting music, making for a bad transition from bar scene to food shop.  At night the place was quite crowded and clearly housing a lot of intoxicated peeps.   Even after a few drinks, the Phlilly sandwhich was whatever.  Add their spicy sauce to make your sandwich something to contemplate about.  As a hangover local, its worth the walk, as pure foodery, it was subpar.

To poor traveling college students and peeps under 25.  Just cause it's the cheapest, does mean you'll save the most money.  Basically I booked my Advantage Car online through Southwest because it had the lowest base fare.  Reasonable for a starving college student.    Following the pleasant bus trip to the rental car building, I managed to stand in line for 25 minutes despite a full lot of customer service representatives (like 15).  I suspect those representatives tried to sell a lot extra amenities.    The wait wasn't the issue, it was the flat denial of my debit card.  I expected them to put like a $300 hold on my card, but they simply would not accept it.  They also planned to tack on a $25 fee for being underaged.  The rep was kind enough to recommend me to another rental car service with weaker qualifications.  I guess this is more of warning than a review.  I'll make sure to never bring my renting needs to Advantage.

As a San Diegan, Oggis original home, I was really disappointed with my home town pizza brew.  My sausage artichoke pizza was a spot above your home baked frozen pizza, just less chewy.   I suspect my trip might have been better if I didn't follow the bar tender's advice to get the house tomato sauce on a normal crust.  Everyone around me got their buffalo sauce on a thin crust, and appeared to be really enjoying themselves.    So I got a full flight which is 8 tasters for $9, not too bad.  If you aren't a beer drinker get the Light Lager, if you like medium beer get the Scotch and the black if you like beers dark as night.    Light lager. One of the best lights on tap anywhere with a little wheat finish Amber. Hoppy start  with no body  and a stingy finish Pale.  Worse than amber  Hef. So so, just no wheat taste  Gold.   Absolutely unremarkable and indistinguishable from the amber and pale  IPA Lingering hoppy water Scotch ale. Some maltiness with a splash of caramel.  Best beer of the bunch. Black.  A darker hoppier version of the Scotch.    An OK place to catch the Coyote game and kick it with your guy friends.  If you're looking for your authentic pizza or craft brews, look else where.

FIVE STARS if you climb to the top. Three stars if you just stroll to the hole in the wall   Not to rain on any one's parade, but I think yelpers would reconsider their 4 star rating if they checked out the view on top the rock.  I do not believe climbing to the top is quite sanctioned, given there is no official trail.    A word of caution of course. If you are an abled bodied, clear minded, and careful soul, it should take you no more than 15 minutes from the easiest starting point.    Half the fun is figuring it out.  As the peep on top of the rock instructed me, find your "adventurous spirit," and you will find a way to the top.  If you think your route is too tough, it probably is.  This climb definitely requires shoes with good grip, don't even consider it if you have any doubts about your shoes.    It is a challenging climb for the novice, and probably a sneeze for the most experienced mountain climber,  regardless the view is well worth it. Spoiler alert in my attached pic.    As for the non climbing experience straight to the hole, the nature walk is easy.  Even the most non adventurous can make it.  If your company needs convincing, just tell them, if they can walk up one flight of stairs, they have met the physical requirements.    Ideal trek for both the afternoon stroll or a simple climb.  I will bring all my acceptably fit friends to the top.    Car door to top of the rock to car door time : 1 hour.     Car door to hole to car door time: 30 minutes.

A lovely low key, unpretentious beer bar off Mill Avenue.  Accidentally stumbled into Taste of Tops for their Eel River Brewery event, which was amazing in its own right.  This isn't your bar average college bar, most peeps are in their late 20's and know their beer.        The sampler was amazing, $8 for 4 4oz samplers. Quite a good deal.  Technically their tasters are a bit expensive, but their selection makes up.  There are at least 18 constantly changing taps, with a pretty balanced selection.   2 beers per style with more pales ales.  They had famous breweries like Deschutes, Stone and Maui plus a few local brews.  They go 1 keg at a time, so don't get attached like a one night stand.  Get a pint or two and love them for the night.    The frig was dead on my trip, so they let you bring in food from their neighbors.  Go two shops down to Tessios (separate review), and while you wait pick a beer from Top's Liquor next door and try it here.  Odd Note.  They actually had a few beer magazines like Draft sitting about.  If you can't find a nice peep to chat with, grab a magazine or watch some ABC family channel movie.  They had Harry Potter The Chamber of Secrets playing, quite unusual movie for a bar.  Oh yeah they have a small chilled bottle section in the back.    A great place for 3-6 peep sized groups, but they place easily gets full.  Stop by for kick back locale with your friends and enjoy your night.

An incredibly nice surprise hidden among the strip malls and warehouses.    4 only because my beer tasting was incomplete.  Season special Marzen is ok, but a suprise beer for a microbrewery. Porter was AMAZING!  I'll be back just for this, reminds of me a Black Butte, but with a bit more character, a definate must get.    The place does not serve food other than its pretzel dough.  They are more than happy to let you bring in food or order in.  The pretzel dough is a bit overpriced, but does make for good palet clensing and beer soaking.  If purchased, make sure to pair with a beer or drown it in jam.   No jam or beer = disaster.    If you just need something to munch on, they have free popcorn with a ridiculious amount of condiments, shaming every movie theater and grocery store in America.  The place is clean and well designed enough for me to bring a lady friend, yet scruffy enough for me to bring the boys.    I'll be back for the rest of their beers and happy hour, the prices were really fair even off happy hour.  Just make sure to be around when the Cardinals are winning, so everyone is in a good mood.

Review on Selection and Beer Class  Beer selection. A larger beer selection than BevMo, but the selection does periodically miss the really rare beers.  If you are looking for  something  recently released, like Vertical epic, try Bevmo, or call the store before you visit.  A note of caution, it is quite difficult to locate a specific beer, it is best to ask the staff because the beer could literally be anywhere in the store.    Belgium Beer Tasting Class.   So I signed up for the monthly beer class, which is a steal at $15. I don't like Belgium beers, but the class gave me a new appreciation for them.   Overall the class was filled with a few beer geeks and some curious Phoenicians.  The class comes with 12 beers samples, palette cleansing nuts, 1 PowerPoint and a score sheet.  I loved learning about the random origin of beer names. The speed of the class really depends on your instructor and how much the class likes a beer.    So if you don't know anything about beer, this is the best low key place to learn.  Friendly and non judging, you are allowed to ask any question.  The class really only takes 75 mins, but you might need the extra 45 mins to walk off the beer.  Either have a DD, or merely moisten your lips with the beer and pour the rest out.  So, beer class is like wine tasting, don't drink everything.  So if you're like me, a little part you dies every time you pour out your beer.  It's painful, but I'll be back.

Some how they managed to top my previous experience with these two new finds.  Is your desired beverage room temp and not ready for an outing?  You're in luck! This Total Wine has a fantastic cooler machine! In  3-8 minutes and your beverage goes from room temp to party temp.    The beer selection has some gotten significantly over the last 2 months.  Not only is it magically more organized, there are more famous breweries such as Odell, Cooney Island and Left Hand.  If you can't find something make sure to ask the staff.

The rumors are true, this place was an awesome continental breakfast. It's not the usual Costco Danish +  some small cereal boxes.  They had 4 hot buffet trays with eggs, sausages, potatoes, several coffee flavors and a waffle maker with all the condiments and more!  The service was quite good and the rooms were clean and not cheap looking.  My family booked it the night before and we got a surprisingly fair price.   Its right next to the Glendale Stadium stores, so be wary when the Cardinals are playing at home.  The location is ideal for Glendale and downtown trips.    Stop by for an superb breakfast on a budget to start a fun day in Phoenix.

The exterior of the Zinnias doesn't do the shop justice, cause inside is one beautiful disaster.  One moment you're in a 60's ice cream parlor and the next step inside a GI WW2 bunker.  Prices wildly vary, so there are some definite over priced items, and even fewer gems.   This place is the Ideal place to get lost in for an hour or two.  Be warned those, this place is not for everyone.  IF you love clean straight edge lines, this place will be a night mare. The posted pictures give a good feel for the place.    If you're the kind of peep who likes to rummage and visit street fairs, this place will dazzle you with its clutter.    Its not stated explicitly, but the shop is a random assortment of goods because it's a showcase for 40 artist.  As the owner stated "each little block has its own personality," and is in almost in constant flux because each block only last a few days, so check the front board for 50% off signs.    Everything is for sale, so make sure to peruse all the carousels and shelves.    So if you're claustrophobic and OCD, stay away for your own safety.  For the vintage collector and white wall decorator, make a stop by.

Ever wonder if all beers taste like water, ie.Coors and Bud? Let Old World Brewery blow your mind. The Brewery is the perfect spot to begin your education in craft beer brewing.  I don't like to sugarcoat thing, it's not the 4 Seasons, but what it lacks in style, it spends on its beer.  (Pretty places don't spend enough on their food)    Old World Brewery really puts the drink in drinkability, the owner believes that craft brewing should be accessible to everyone, and crafts his beer so both newbies and enthusiastic can enjoy.  Don't let the funny names intimidate you from ordering.  The staff is super friendly and would love to help you choose the right beer.   I had an unusual taster rack, made of 4 different scotch glasses.    Blonde Nitro : Lightest flavor, and not for me.    The Prick.  Wheat beer mixed with gallons of cactus fruit.  Definitely try this beer.  It's a light wheat beer with a hint of fruity mellowness.  4 Irish Red.  Their best seller and my favorite of the bunch.  Good malts and with a little hoppy finish.    Brown.   Really dark.  It was ok.  The place is made to hang out with dart boards, a tv and open space.  Don't let its somewhat odd location stop you from coming by.

Love the decorations! I'm not one for clutter but this place is a hot mess in the best way.  Got potato salad, burger rye with Utah ( ketchup + mayo) and Pepperchinis.  Be warned, I got rye,so my burger was more a sandwich, but I'm not a Semantics Nazi.  In order to really enjoy your burger, you have to cut it in half to get some good food porn for your stomach.  The burger was an amazing mix of flavors and well worth its price.      The place means BYOB is every sense, build it and bring your own beer.  No corking fee, and a friendly staff makes for a good kick back place in the hot afternoon.    One quick note, if you sit on the side, you're next to the kitchen; so unless you want to smell like burger, sit else where. Be sure to wave at the cook.  I'll be back with a nice hopped beer and empty stomach.

Thank God for Toni and Guy, because quite frankly I was ready to go bald if I got one more bad haircut elsewhere.    First off, its important to understand that this place is the academy, so your haircut will be done by a student.  Don't let that student tag scare you off, because before a student can see clients,  they must have had at least 6 months of classroom learning.  Also realize every student is different, so when you sign up you could get someone about to graduate.   Note, it's best to schedule an appointment because the place does fill up.    If you are new to the service, don't worry about the hairstyling.  All cuts and colors are reviewed by a teacher.  For newer students expect the teacher to probably cut most of your hair, while older students will have almost pure autonomy.  Quick note, if you do not know what you want, just decide if you want a more typical hair cut or something more edgy.     I don't know how long women's cuts take, but generally a men's cut will take the full 90 mins.  This includes shampooing, cutting and styling.  The place is really relaxed and is not really pushy with their products.  My only complaint is that the music can be so random that I don't know if I'm about to square dance or rave.    The price and quality are unbeatable if you are willing to wait.  If you are expecting a 30 minute run through, this isn't your place.

Hooray their music finally found itself.  I'm so happy their music is less bipolar, and now just a mix of house, rock and pop.    Lovely as usual, and I learned they have a little book of haircuts.  If you don't know what you want, just ask to see their book and see your potential hair cuts.  Since you're just as good looking as their models, it'll help you and your student figure out what you want. .

"Gross.. someone bit mine."   Don't despair, it's their trademark.    A fantastic place to pick up a nice dessert while you people watch or window shop out and about Tempe.  Its at the center Mill's, so it's the ideal local to pick up a treat and wander.  If you don't like tart, stay away from anything raspberry related.  My favorite is the rich and creamy arroz con leche.  Stop by when it's triple digits or need a free pass to visit Mills.

Da Burger Shack has two things you rarely find in the valley.    A genuine friendly staff and HARIO COLD DRIP COFFEE!!!  I'm somewhat torn to tell the world, so I can horde it all for myself.  That hunk of wood and glass next to the counter is actually an expensive way to brew low acid strong coffee.  For whatever reason it's in the shack and they sell it.   I can't write enough how friendly the staff were.  They really bring that island friendliness, in the typical cold city culture.    As for burgers, my first trip was daily dealled with fish n chips.   The second outing was Cal Burger filled.  Both meals were satisfying, but not sensational.  Their daily deal is an outstanding value, so outstanding it seems to be always sold out when I stop by.      As for atmosphere, not the place to bring your first date, but definitely a good place to call home after several outings in need for comfort foods.  The food is a 3 plus 1 for coffee and service.  I'll be back for the rest of their pictured food and coffee of course.

I accidental stumbled upon this place while completely dehydrated on 5th Ave.   The only sign indicating Bodega's existence, was this 3ft chalkboard  placard stating, "Fresh Lemonade for a $1."  So, I rolled in and figured out this place was like a mini farmer's market, with locally grown multicolored carrots, vacuumed chicken and fresh artisan bread.  It also had several varieties of beans,  local citrus and some crafts.    I got a lemonade and a donut plus its fried center.  The donut was semi old fashion, not greasy and magically still crunchy.  The lemonade had quite the zing even with honey and a nice balance to moderately sweat donut.  Quick note, the key is to violently stir your lemonade.    If you don't know what to order, the staff was exceptionally friendly and happy to educate you on their goods.  Apparently, the shop is the love child of the FND chef.  Her goal was to provide the public with the same quality ingredients she uses at her restaurant.   I suspect she hopes you will  wine and dine at Baratin and walk out of Bodega with armful of meats and veggies for dinner.     If you're not in the mood  for home cooking, Bodega is still the perfect place for a simple satisfying snack while walking 5th Avenue or a hiding spot as your significant other peruses about.

Beer is almost a 4, food is a 3, service was a 4.5.  + Check in deal makes it a 5.  Add that up and divide by the hungry fellow and you get a 4.    I got a pretzel and an oatmeal stout pulled pork burger.  Forget the pretzel, it's a essentially a utensil to enjoy their amazing sauces.  Even if you don't like pretzels or the sauce, it makes for a great palate cleanser between beers.  The burger was nothing spectacular.  I don't know where the oatmeal stout in the sauce, but it might have been in there.   Best part of the trip was getting a got a complete education beer mixology.  WHAT PEOPLE MIX BEERS!   I learned about the Stumbler and the Snake bite; ask and you shall receive.    Sampler note: Make sure to bring another mouth to finish a sampler, unless you plan to taxi and walk home.   Beer Recommendations: Lady friend who hates beer: Snake Bite Hop Head: Pale Complex Beer Drinker: Stumbler or MonkeyShine  Pilsner.  light and amazing wheat finish, I can drink this all day Blonde ok little citrus, Pilsner was better Pale. Light with dry bitter finish, not for average drinker  Red. Simple hoppy red  Brown. a bit darker crispy red Oatmeal. Not smooth enough for a dark oatmeal,  surprisingly a bit hoppy  Old Monkeyshines. Simply intriguing   If you are looking for a clean cut safe beer place with decent food and some beer geeks, Nimbus is your place.

Stopped by because Sundance was full and  recently increased their price.  Although at at times more expensive than Sundance, the small extra expense is worth the peace of mind.   NOTE! I found a coupon conventionally on their homepage.     Faux leather seats and an easily recognizable bus in the chaos of airport traffic, getting picked up after hours can be nerve wracking.  Calling in after midnight, I actually spoke with the driver, who found me quick.  I expect for the businessman or family, this is a good fit.

To poor traveling college students and peeps under 25.  Following an absolute disaster at Advantage (previous review), I was lucky Enterprise rented me a car.  I'm quite certain lightning does strike the same spot twice.  Overall I managed to get a better car for less; you can't really ask for more.    I had the friendliest and most helpful service rep.  Basically Advantage wouldn't rent me a car given payment plan, while Enterprise asked for $10 (given my age) and a departing flight itinerary (to make sure I won't steal their car and drive it across country?).  Since I only needed the car for like 5 hours, the rep upgraded me from a economy car to Ford Fusion for free. REALLY?!  I had to use my hand to keep my mouth shut from the excitement.  To top it all off, when you pick up the car, they offer complimentary water bottles.  Perfect for the excruciating hot Phoenix.    So if you need a car, don't have a reservation and your day is completely in the gutter, let Enterprise come to the rescue.
