This place is amazing!  Dan, Jerry and the rest of the staff are professional and welcoming to all of their guests.  We had such a wonderful time on our 2-hour trail ride with our Cuban guide.  I happily drove from Tempe and would drive from Chandler, Scottsdale, or Phoenix to ride here again.  The ride was therapeutic for my soul and my body.  My attitude is improved and my back and hips are all loosened up!

I tried Tom's for the first time today in my qwest for tasty barbecue close to home.  I had a brisket sandwich with fries.  The brisket was tender and smokey.  I just happen to not be a fan of sweet BBQ sauce and Tom's sauce almost bowled me over with the smell and flavor of cinnamon or nutmeg in the sauce.  The only other sauce option appeared to be hot.  I would have scored this place better if there was another sauce option.  Other than that the establishment was clean and the staff friendly.  I would definitely recommend this to people who enjoy the sweet BBQ sauce.

If you're in Tempe come check this place out.  The coffee and sandwiches are delicious and reasonably priced.  A noteworthy item here is the superb customer service.  The baristas refer to customers by name when checking in on people sitting around the cafe (pretty cool when they only hear your name once when ordering).  A personal touch in an impersonal world.  I highly recommend this cafe to anyone in Mesa, Tempe, Chandler or Scottsdale.

I have used Boston Market for my company holiday parties previously without incident.  However, For Thanksgiving some key parts of our order (gravy) were missing from our Turkey dinner order.  I decided to try the catering option to pick up at the store to see if I would get better results.  Much, much worse!  I arrived to pick up my order and the girl at the counter (possibly a manager) told me it would be a few minutes because they got a late start.  No big deal, I thought, even though their lack of preparedness is not my issue.  I sat there for 30 minutes and then had to pay extra for them not completing the order.  The young girl said "sorry for the inconvenience."  There was no attempt to make it right.  I'm going to find an alternative for my company parties going forward.

Wow so I purchased a used car here, which was a painful enough experience.  So they throw in free maintenance to pacify me.  Sounds okay, right?  WRONG.  I've been in the maintenance department for over 3 hours.  First they suggested a new battery.  Seems reasonable, right?  WRONG!  They don't have a battery and it took 2 hours of my inquiries to get that little nugget of information.  Now they can't give me my car because "they cannot find it".   What kind of place is this!?

I have to say that I had not tried reflexology before coming here and my response is WOW!  This place is quiet and relaxing, and the young woman who did my session was amazing.  Her name is Angela and I highly recommend her.  The cost is also fantastic at $30 for an hour.  I'm definitely coming here again.

All I can say is "Wow!" I tried these guys because they had a booth set up at Denim and Diamonds.    Oh my....I am so glad I tried the brisket sandwich.  It was warm drippy barbecued delightfulness!    I highly recommend a trip to this eatery.  You will not be let down.  I would drive from Tempe, Chandler, or even Scottsdale for another sandwich!

Great lunch place!  I am so happy I can order my lunch online and it's ready for pickup.  I tried the carne asada burrito today and it was delicious.  I will definitely be a repeat lunch customer.

Louis Parker is an outstanding bankruptcy attorney.  I sat down with him one day when I was considering bankruptcy and his insights and suggestions prompted me to research my debt issue more thoroughly.  I discovered that a slightly higher payment towards my debt could eliminate it within 3 years.  I happily drove from Mesa to his Phoenix office to speak with him, but would have driven from Chandler, Tempe or Scottsdale as well.  He is genuinely interested in the best options for his clients rather than suggesting bankruptcy to all in order to boost his fees.  I highly recommend Louis to anyone who is or may be considering bankruptcy.

I wish I'd has as good an experience as others with this cafe.  My bacon was burned and the coffee smelled and tasted burned as well.  This cafe is priced higher and the food quality is lower than other breakfast eateries in the area.  I certainly won't be back.

Michele did a fantastic job when I saw her for a facial and microdermabrasion .  She uses products that are non irritating to sensitive skin and they smell fantastic!  I drove from central Mesa to see her and would have gladly driven from Scottsdale, Tempe or Chandler.

I needed new wiper blades for my car and the guy at the counter, Jerry, was nice enough to install them for me as well.

Love this place!  The restaurant is modern and clean.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The food is delicious and beautiful.  Yes I did say "beautiful".  I ordered a simple gyro pita and side Greek salad.  I received this beautifully presented and colorful meal that delighted my senses!  I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes or would like to try Greek food.  You will not be disappointed.
