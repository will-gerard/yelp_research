If you value your time and actually get your order, do not come here.  They completely ignore your order and you actually have to inquire about it.  Awesome.

I attempted to purchase some custom size tires for my vehicle and they decided to cancel my order because it doesn't fit my car.  First of all, it is my prerogative on what size tires I want to purchase on my car.   I have purchased tires from Discount Tire Direct before and I never had an issue.  Supposedly I talked to a manager and he said in 2012 they made a rule that they cannot sell tires that won't fit a vehicle.  Safety wise I understand, but apparently they do not care if they make a sell verses canceling someone's order due to the fact the tire won't fit a car.    I will never do business with Discount Tire Direct ever again.

Visited Las Vegas for the weekend and a few friends from Hawaii recommended this place.  Plus it was near my friends house so that was a plus.    Great selection of poke!  I wish we had a place like this in Arizona, but alas we don't.     Since I had to drive back to Arizona, I stopped by and purchased a ice chest just to transport this poke and a few other Hawaii goodies.  As soon as I got home, I ate all of this onolicious poke!    When I do visit Las Vegas again, this is my goto place!
