I can only cancel my membership from 9-5 Mon-Fri, while I should be at work, or by mailing a request in...    Really??   Yet I can sign up in 2 seconds on the website.   I question any company that makes it this hard to stop using their services.

I'm shocked to see so many positive reviews.  Bread is subpar, staff at the location is rude, or at least they were to us.  Definately will not return to this store, nor purchase any of their products (which are sold under many different names).

Wow.  That's really all I can say about my experience here.  Finding a mechanic where you know you are not being taken advantage of is an amazing thing.  Community Tire Pros fixed my vehicle for a fair price, did not try to upsell me things I know I do not need, and did not pressure me at all on things that need to be fixed, but not necessarily right away.  I highly highly recommend this place.

I was looking forward to going here as I've heard a lot about it.   Overall it was a blah experience.  Hamburgers were okay but nothing to write home about.   Onion rings were cold and pretty skimpy on the onion, def not worth the $2.50 up charge.  For the overall price vs food, won't be making the trek to Gilbert again.

So the management of Joe's contacted me about my experience.  They genourously offered a giftcard for a revisit.  I can honestly say that shocked me tremendously.  While Joe's is a pretty far drive for me, I thought it only fair to give them a second shot.  My second experience was definitely better than the first.  We switched it up and tried the pizza and fish sandwich. had to get the onion rings also, to see if the ones from my first visit were unusually bad.  I am happy to report that the food this time around was much better.  The onion rings this time around were crisp and fresh.  The ingredients are fresh, and you can definitely taste it.  Overall I believe my first experience was a random fluke....I guess every place has a 'bad day.  Overall I would give Joe's 4 stars, BUT, customer service is huge, and I appreciate being contacted regarding my prior experience, so the 5th star is for excellent customer service.

I had Brandy as a driver and she was awesome we were coming home from Strong Beer Fest and Brandy was awesome and picked us right up. Took us from downtown to Tempe and had a perfectly cooled cab. We love her.

Food is average, but if you enjoy eating at a place that treats you like they're doing you a favor by letting you eat there, this is the place for you.

bland and overpriced.  For a place that specializes in strips, you'd think they would be better than KFC.....they are not.

I heard a lot of excitement over this place so decided to give it a try.   I heard it was the In and Out of the east coast.    The burger was good, on par with In and Out, Smashburger and 5 Guys.    The main difference is the price.   Holy shnikes.  Over $15 for a burger, fries and drink.    I'd give it 3 1/2 stars for food and 1 star for price.
