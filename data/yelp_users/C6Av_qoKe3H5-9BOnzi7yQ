Went here for lunch the other day...zowie! what a great place. Minute I walked in I was impressed as I have a liking for rich dark woods. Great looking place.   had a seat in a big fat booth and server Kelly was over in a flash to greet us and asking what we would like to drink. I thought it was great how she explained in detail that all the juice drinks are made from fresh to order from freshly squeezed juices- WOW Are you kidding me?!?! My wife ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade and it was awesome she said. I told Kelly I wanted a glass of white wine and unlike seemi9ngly most servers these days, she guided me through the labyrinth of wines to exactly what was going to turn me on. That was artful service and it didn't stop there either.    We asked her for some appetizer selections and she explained many in great detail. We selected the Spinach and Artichoke Dip with Crostinis that was really very good - rich and creamy with large pieces of spinach (I hate when they are all diced). I ordered 4 oysters on teh half shell. Kelly brought them to the table and pointed and explained each oyster and wher it was originated: malpeque Oyster, Blue Point Oyster, Hama Hama Toyer, Gold Creek oyster. My favorite was the Blue Point. They were served with cocktail sauce and horseradish traditionally; however, it also came with if I can recall correctly was a Chardonnay infused oil or something that was outstanding to pare with the oysters.   My wife has Chicken Alfredo pasta - yea she did. A bountiful splendor of  treasures form the grotto of the sea and she orders chicken. Each there own I guess but I'm not going to expand on her selection - it was chicken.   This menu was so thick with things for me to order I just couldn't decide so I asked my server Kelly to choose for me and she hit it right on the mark with the Albacore Tuna sesame crusted with a Thai Chiki sauce. Outstanding hunk of fish and cooked absolutely perfectly - BRAVO! It was served with a nice Juliane of vegetables. My only issue here was the unsuspected slice of ginger hidden in there that I unsuspected ate and really hate.   Great experience and outstanding service - top notch and remarkably affordable. There was so much to choose from and our server also explained that the menu changes TWICE a day - yes TWICE a day. Only thing I was out of the ordinary was a "10 UNDER $10 SPECIALS" list I guess for the penny pinching pamelas in the crowd - really seems your selling yourselves short there at the price point with  this quality, location, product and ambiance.

I just love this 'lil burger joint. My diet doesn't allow me such greasy-goodies so I only go maybe twice a year...bu I always look forward to it. My wife and kid were away and I happened to be driving by so I popped in for a double burger. Their burgers are fantastic (my wife likes the home made pies) Anyhow, sat at the counter and had great conversation with the counter cooks...great guys; great friendly service. I asked why the burgers were so good asking if was the seasoned grill and he said the key was they use fresh unfrozen meat and just salt and pepper. Simplicity that tastes it's finest.

Go somewhere else. Really bad service and mediocre food. I don't understand crappy rude service. Why? We pay your bills. Really snarky counter girl really got under my skin. Ordered my food and no eye contact or a thank you.  Gave her my corporate credit card to pay and she snaps back its declined. I told her it was impossible as there's 12 thousand in there and asked her to run it again. She literally rolled her eyes at me. No really she rolled her eyes at me like I'm some deadbeat who can't pay for a 6 dollar burro. Of course it went through. No thanks or eye contact again. Come to get my food she walked away without asking me if I needed anything. Had to wait and ask for my soda cup. She pours me a solo cup of water without ice and walks away. Have to wait for her to come back and ask for my cup again. She shoots me the stink eye and says she doesn't remember charging me for a drink. Brings me a small cup when my receipt says MD Soda $1.65. Again she lays out a snarky comment saying nearly under her breath that she hadn't charged me for the soda and now I'm annoyed further from her remarks inferring I'm a scammer and looked right in her eye and said You know what. ..you did charge me. Had a carne asada burro with beans no rice. Bland food. Everything needs salt. No love in this food at all.

Valle Luna Chandler  My wife and I were kid free the other night and were deciding where to go and deducted down to Valle Luna because of the lakeside setting. We got there and parked in the lot and the very first thing you see in the front parking lot is an overflowing open gated nasty dumpster with boxes and rotton food spewing out. We nearly turned around and said S@REW THIS, but we didn't.  Inside we asked the host for patio seating which she said was booked; however, there was first-come-first-serve on the bar patio. Scored a ringside seat next to the lake! Yippie! I'm so gettin' some tonight with this setting. However, the ambiance was really marred by 2 things. First was the wafting of clouds of cigarette smoke lofting into our serene spot. Ewww, not to be a hypocrite as I smoked like 12 years ago..no check that cigarettes are gross. The other issue was the EXTREMELY INTOXICATED middle aged foul mouthed trashy cougar hooker seated behind us. Her and her skank girlfriend sat down about 1/2 hour after we did and she was friggin' hammered upon being seated. She later exclaimed to her friend about how she'd been drinking wine ALL DAY...yea really, you handle and hide it well. I totally shook my head as I watched the server dude take her order and thought, "Dude you're not really going to serve that sloshy puddle more booze are you?" and he did - and multiple times. Unbelievable! Where's the Liquor Board when they're needed.   The other issue about the facility is the stank in the bar area. It has the aroma of a high school boys locker room. They really need to address this as it's nasty...carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned this millennium.   You can't go wrong drinking a Corona Light in this atmoshere and my wife had a Don Julio Blanca Marg Rocks that was good to. Later she prdered teh same but with a Chambord shot in it...awesome drink!  My wife loves that they serve a bean dip with the chips and I thought the salsa was very tasty and chunky. I hate it when the salsa is watery thin. Chips were good ny wife said as I don't eat them.   My wife had red cili enchiladas that were just ok...nothing special. I was pleased to see sea bass on the menu...yea! Ordered it but the server forgot to ask me which of the 2 sauces I wanted or about the sides. I flagged him down and told him the sauce and also said that I didn't want any rice. Food comes, there's the friggin' rice all over my plate. I'm not really picky but seriously I asked specifically for no rice and there it is and it's not like you can just push it aside as it crosses the international borders into the veggies, beans and fish sauce...forced to have a re-make. 8 minutes later and my wife is 1/2 done and here it comes back out. Looks good...taste is stone cold...what a shame as it was a good looking piece of fish.   Without that lake...we would never come back.

I first dined here about a year ago and was really disappointed in wasn't going to go back; however, my wife had a coupon from some coupon book and I went to go get some takeout to watch Sunday football. First of all, the service in this restaurant sucks. There's laid-back and then there is rude-they are rude. I finally get to the counter to order and the girl is drinking a soda and eating her breakfast on the cashier counter. She said to me, "what do you want?" And didn't even give me I contact. I probably should just walked out right then and known better, but I didn't. I ordered street tacos and they were an absolute joke. The worst of it was the Pasole which really was void of taste, however, the worst part or all the cartilage in bones that were in there. Now I understand that you need that in there for flavor when making Pasole because I make that soup frequently. When I pulled out the bones and the cartilage it amounted to about the size of a tennis ball. The flavor of it was really Bland and overall just not good. Good thing I found rather interesting was that they charge $.75 anytime that you make a non-cash transaction. That's just ridiculous.

I've been going to this shop for about five years now, off and on. I went in there for the first time years ago to talk about over seeding my yard which is 16,000 ft. They have these packages that they sell to you which have the seed, fertilizer, and mulch for different yard sizes. I always buy the big package and do about 75% of my yard leaving the other 25% undone with the Bermuda grass. This year when I went in to get my package the guy at the desk was quite the jerk to me. I chalked it up to them being rather busy at the time and said to myself I would just let it go. My wife came up to me a few days ago and said that she wanted me to over seed the rest of the yard which we usually don't do. So I went there to get a small package for this 3000 square-foot area. They usually have a sign up that lists the different packages and I couldn't see it anymore. I was looking around and it was quite odd but no one came to help me regardless. So then I approached the desk and asked the guy where the sign was for the different packages for over seeding, and he said to me, "I took that down last week. It's November" And didn't expand upon it at all. I then said, "Well, what can you do for me because I want to over seed my grass?" And he said, "Nothing." And then walked away from me. I was quite shocked by that and stood there for moment. When I walked in I saw mulch. Inside I saw fertilizer and seed. So first, I don't understand why he was being a jerk, and second, everything was still available. So I decided just to leave. I shop here because it's local...not because their prices are low. I'll just go to Lowe's from now on as they are cheaper...and nicer.

Was staying at the resort across the street so I ate here this morning. Was a bit annoyed from the get-go as I stood at the front waiting to be seated for nearly 5 min. Some woman several minutes after I arrived also stood at the adjacent cash register and when somebody finally did arrive they helped her before me which again was a bit annoying. After that the guy asked if I was being seated and I said no that I was waiting and he pointed to the table right next to me and said "just sit there." I said okay to proceed and sat for 7 min. before the server came up and approached me. Service was smooth sailing after that it was just bumpy in the beginning.  Had eggs Benedict and it was very good. The holiday sauce was rich and creamy and there's a nice chunk a ham in there to. I thought the coffee was really good to.

Really good experience here. To bad its so far away from my home and office. Anywho, had a business meeting at the Kierlands and took my sales director here for dinner and discussion afterward. As soon as you walk in your smell Italian. Reminded me of when I lived in New York. Took a seat and Chaz the waiter comes by and of course knows my employee. Good rapport is established and Chaz shows good product knowledge - he knows what he's doing and guides us through the menu. This seems to be a forgotten science these days with the "order taker" mentality of the turn and burn server of our microwave society. I digress.  We ordered the Calamari Infernalli which was sauteed in a spicy tomato sauce which was an awesome alternative to the usual bread coating. Just the right amount of spice kick - good stuff and recommended.   We both ordered Filetto Saltimbocca Del Porco as an entree. If I'm not mistaken Saltimbocca means melt in your mouth and that's exactly what it does. the pork loin is stuffed with cheese, sage and pancetta with a delicate sauce and was just awesome. Would coem back just for this again.   Great experience and nice job Chaz.

My wife and I did a priceline stay-cation here last month and absolutely loved it. I had forgotten about this gem of a hotel as it oozzzes the style of the way Scottsdale and Arizona used to be and yes I know what I'm talking about as I'm a native. My mother has a pic of me playing with a tonka truck in a dirt road that is now Hayden and Osborn. Anyhow, this is how Scottsdale used to be.  The staff is top notch. I'm particular about my 750Li and the took care of it well. Front desk dude was very nice and it was a really cool extra when we were given 2-4-1 discount cards for the dinign room, as well as, the Sunday brunch. We were planning on going to the Hyatt for dinner and for the gondola ride; however, they kept us on campus.   Pool bar was cool and had a good happy  hour. Pool is a bit small. We also went inside to the bar for $5 happy hour appetizers. Nice selection and great prices. Try the sangria - top notch.   The dining room is a gem. Old school waiters that have been there for 20+ years and have honed their trade. Table-side service cooking shrimp scampi next to m chair. Dessert table-side for my wife. Wow! Great stuff!  We had brunch in the morning that was absolutely outstanding and again with top notch service. Only negative about brunch was too many people so long lines formed which was a bit annoying.   Room was also top notch with a huge flat-screen TV that I REALLY appreciated for Sunday morning NFL. Only negative here were dirty clothes left on the patio presumably from the previous guests.   Double thumbs up here!

First time here and the facility is actually very impressive inside and out. I also noted how incredibly clean everything was including the restroom. Service was just ok. Server brought out chips and 4 salsas. I would expect the server to take 8 seconds to explain what they were instead of having to guess. Wife had lunch chimi day it was ok. Kid quesadilla was cold. I ordered chorizo chicken. It was rather good but the portion size was stupid small. Like a half a breast. It felt like a typical corporate menu item downsized for cost. It was more an appetizer portion. Host staff was really unfriendly. When I got there I went to restroom to wash my hands and blonde host said nothing on way in and out. 2nd restroom visit Hispanic female looked up and gave me eye contact and said nothing as she went back to reading whatever she had at the podium. I always feel the host staff is super important as they are the restaurant ambassadors and the first and last impression. No Nothing is ever good enough for you with me Michael.need to be so unfriendly.   Probably wont go back..to many other options around town with that food genre.

Avoid this branch if possible. Customer Service is a complete joke. I went in to but my wife a ring and pendent combination that I saw online. I arrived and no one was available to help me. Two clerks and they were busy with people. One clerk said someone would be with me shortly. 25 minutes passed and I was sitting on a chair still waiting. The other clerk, and older female, had finished up with her customer and instead of serving me she spent another 5 minutes shuffling paperwork and answering the telephone. She finally approached me and delivered a cursory "Sorry for the wait." I said, "I understand you must be short staffed but I am on a time limit" an asked her to show me the items. Nothing. Her response was nothing. I then pointed at a few items I wanted to look over. She retrieved them and put them on the desk again without word or eye contact. I asked her a few questions and she was either not knowledgeable or annoyed with me. I then tell her it will be necessary to find my wife's ring size from another Helzberg store before I purchase the set (I've bought her 4 rings over the years from them). Her response, "Well that's going to be a problem." At that point I walked out thinking to myself, "Well keep your problems lady." She came across as snooty and rather condescending. I think it was because I had been doing yard work and wasn't dressed very appropriately. I really got the feeling she was judging my book by my cover ... That's OK I'll spend my money elsewhere.

We ordered a bowl of the beef with barley soup.  The beef barley soup contained a surprising amount of beef, and the we very much enjoyed this.  We thought that the beef barely soup had great flavor and enjoyed the different vegetables contained within it.    For an entrée, we decided to split a entrée special which was a jumbo Canadian lobster tail.  The lobster tail was hot, well seasoned and presented nicely atop the tail shell.  The lobster tail mat was slightly sweet and firm, and won over both of us.  For the price charged, we felt  that this was an excellent value for the price.    The baked potato was split open and sides of sour cream topped with chives and butter pats were provided.  The vegetable of the evening was a mix of white and orange carrots and they tasted sweet, lightly seasoned and well cooked to a nice tenderness.  A side of butter in a tea light heater was provided to dip the lobster into.    After dinner we decided to split an apple dumpling for dessert.  The dumpling was served in a white bowl and presented nicely in its pastry pouch.  Caramel sauce was drizzled over the apple dumpling and vanilla ice cream was provided alongside.  We both enjoyed the apple dessert, and the  found the sweetness of the apple dumpling paired well with the cool vanilla ice cream.

We went here last Sunday for lunch and were incredibly pleased! The food in this restaurant is authentic and of high quality. You can really taste the fresh ingredients that they use as it brings the quality of their food to another level. I asked the server for recommendation and she told me that chicken cheese relleno and it was absolutely fantastic! Their pricing is a little bit higher than most restaurants Mexican out there; however, he really get what you pay for as you can tell as aforementioned that they use fresh ingredients.  They have a ton of tequilas for specialty margaritas as well.   Now what really made it this Sunday morning/afternoon even that more enjoyable where the mariachis who were playing on their absolutely beautiful patio. These mariachis weren't the run of the mill musicians they were really talented. They created such a nice atmosphere for my wife, my mom and my daughter that we plan on going back again frequently. Here is a video of the mariachis on the patio: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaco5JB-yJI

Really disappointed by this place. Had relatives in town for a wedding And needed same-day laundry service. I called the place like 8:45 AM to ask about same-day service and was told, "as long as you are hereby 10 AM." I arrived at 9:40 AM with the close and asked the lady to have them laundered same-day and she told me, "sorry. They already picked up the bags." She was very polite about it In fact she was a bit snarky In her tone. I pointed at this HUGE sign that they have hanging in the store that reads in big letters IN BY 10 OUT BY 5 And I Told her it was 20 min. before 10 and she again said sorry and that was it. This really threw a wrench  in my day because by this time I was too late to go to a different dry cleaner. If you're going State same-day service 10 to 5 Then don't tell people on the phone to be there by 10 AM. Or have An advertisement sign stating that fact. It's false advertising  and a disservice to customers.

Them an Arizona native and the growth in Scottsdale so this place used to be one of my regular spots way back in the day. I live in the far southeast Valley now and rarely come out to Snottsdale anymore. My wife and I did a staycation at a local resort and we decided to come into here and really glad we did. It seems to be a lost art these days our servers that give a crap about their trade and are knowledgeable about the product that they serve. Our server was a delightful gal who knew the menu inside and out and instead of just taking an order was a menu guider.  We started with the puh-puh platter that they call "the taste of Thai" it was an excellent selection at $14. It had spring rolls, chicken satay, crab Rangoon, potstickers etc. they came with all of these really cool sauces to. Loved it.  My wife rather picky about what she eats usually sticks to the main staples especially when it comes to Asian food. She ordered a Mandarin chicken and as soon as they put it down I could see that she wasn't going to like it as she eats a lot with her eyes and not her mouth. Sure enough she tried it and didn't like it is that orange peel gives off kind of a burnt taste. That's all her and her pickiness because I tried it and I thought it was fantastic don't judge her lack of taste. The server is gracious enough to bring her a replacement plate of teriyaki chicken. They put a rush on the order came out rather quickly and that chicken was absolutely out of this world. It was cooked crispy perfectly and seasoned wonderfully. She said it was the best teriyaki chicken she's ever had. I agree with her.  I had a seafood curry that had scallops and shrimp, call Mari, muscles and fish it was served in a spicy red curry sauce. Server asked me on a scale of 1 to 5 about the heat index and I said a three. Three is hot so be forewarned as I was sweating to the oldies eating that dish. The curry flavor was exceptional.  We also had a bowl of chicken wonton soup that had I think was spinach in it but also these incredibly good chicken dumplings. The ingredients are really good however the broth needed salt.   I love this place can't wait to go again!

Rather disappointed. Was looking forward to going here on a Saturday Night as we were meeting a group old friends and had never been. Heard good things about the joint and had watched the review on PBS some time ago.   First off, the bartender needs to learn some social skills, as well as, a refresher on some of the basics. Sat down and took over 5 minutes to greet us - there were total of 5 people at the bar. Gave us a drink menu then took a full 10 minutes to come back. Really? Wasn't like he was doing anything important, just casually chatting with some customers while we wait dry and parched. Sorry to interrupt your conversation but Alcohol sales are waiting over here sir! He wasn't fully knowledgeable about the liquors the establishment offers either. How about a cocktail napkin for the sweaty beer - they were 6 inches from where he set the glass down. In fact no one had cocktail napkins; just plain lazy. He never checked back with us either or asked for food sales. I had to flag him down to order appetizers. Never came back either, we ended up just leaving and going to the table. I hate that "Scottsdale Bartender" mentality of it seemingly being a favor to serve you. Don't flatter yourself lazy bar-keep.   The wait staff is mature and knowledgeable. Out gal was quirky and funny - we liked her personality. She dropped the ball a few times on beverage service though. Thirsty 12-top of people waiting for drinks decreases your sales and inevitably your tip as the check is smaller. Big hint: Six chicks at the table, you might want to suggest desserts as they WILL order them, but won't if not asked.   FOOD:  Started with Hummus app and pot-stickers. Nothing to write home about and presentation was plain generic. Pot-stickers were on the cold side too.   I ordered a Caesar salad sans the croutons with extra dressing and extra cheese. Came out w/o the extras and was quite dry. Had to ask for more dressing which was brought out. This might be picky but I like my Caesar tossed so it's even and not dressing poured over the top. The big kicker for me was the abundance of giant leafy romaine tops. A Caesar should be the hearts of romaine and chopped - not the other end of the leafy bush as it's too bitter. It was not enjoyed.   I ordered prime rib since we're in a steak house right. Ordered it MEDIUM RARE. MR should be red with some blood. The server dropped my plate and ran before comment so I sat there looking at a piece of Medium Well shoe leather. With that said, the 12 dinners came out wildly staggered and auctioned off at the table - real bush league. How difficult are table/seat numbers. "Who has the Sole? Who has the Steak?" is so unrefined. Some of the guys at the table were served before their wives and then were patiently waiting to eat until their partner's meal arrived - result cold food. Others were finished with their meal before others even got their entrees. The table service as a whole was disconnected and awkward.    Anyhow, I had to send back the prime rib as I don't eat shoe leather; especially for like $30 something bucks. It came back and it was MEDIUM not MEDIUM RARE. I'm not one for the double send back as you don't know what might be brought back the third time if you know what I mean. So I pained through it, and pained I did as this Prime Rib was super bland - really disappointing. In fact all of the food was rather bland and in need of seasoning. One other item was a side of this couscous thingy that sounded interesting. It wasn't - it was awful. Crunchy and tasted odd. Now with that said, it very well may be the correct way to prepare this, I don't know, but it tasted like eating raw rice to me.   No coffee or dessert were offered. I would have ordered a Grand Marnier or a Sambucca if asked as well.   What a tasteless train-wreck. I can think of a ton of other places to drop $140.00 in this part of town.

You can NEVER go wrong here...EVER! What a fantastic setting with great food and tasty craft beer. They have this multi-grain BLT blackened salmon sandwich that is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Had a "flight of beers" and tasted all of them...fav's were heffeweisen and peach ale. Great great service too. This place is a home run.

The three hour tour. I vow to never shop at this store ever again as there customer service is on par with the Department of Motor Vehicles.   Last Sunday I called to verify the price of an item, a iPod Touch 8GB, and to also verify that it had a $50 gift card. Specifically asked if it was a gift card or a Fry's card and the girl told me it was a Fry's Card. So I spent an hour loading up my cart with items to pay and pick up at the store.  Shopping cart won't work - I keep getting an error. Call the store and explain and the gal does it on her computer so I recite the 10 items and item numbers. She says "Oh I got an error." Yea...well just like me. She does it again from the beginning...error again. Goes to get a supervisor and we go through the whole dog and pony show again...twice. Same result error. They tell me that they will go and get all of the items together and put them on will call and I can come pay at the store. They will call me when ready. No one ever calls.   I call the next morning to see what happened. Talked to the specific super from the day before, says sorry about the call, but yes all items are on will call. I ask if at same price and deals and am told yes.   Drive my happy a$$ all the way across town and guess what...yea, nothing on will call. Wait 20 minutes and the box comes up. Agent tells me that not all items are on the same price. Ugghh..specifically asked that in my call. Goes to talk to someone and 10 minutes later comes back and says no. Fine leave that item out. Rings it up and I ask about the gift card...yea you guessed it "What gift card." Same fire drill and I explain it all again in detail to him and gave the guys name I talked to on the phone. 10 more minutes a supervisor comes over and asks. Have to repeat the same story AGAIN.   Growing impatient as this deal is narrowing on 2 3/4 hours in total plus a 25 minute drive here and back. 15 more minutes of waiting and I tell the Agent, "Dude this is just taking too long. Just take out the iPod Touch and I'll pay for the rest and go. Guy gets nervous and says ok just a minute AND LEAVES.   A "manager" came over a few minutes later. This is when it goes over the top. This stocky bald headed white guy approaches me and get this...he puffs up and says to me "Is there a problem here?" Are you friggin' kidding me! Well yea, with your arrogant and aggressive puff up and comment, well yea there was an issue and now it is a problem. This from a "Manager" no less. I geared for a comment, but then bit my lip and just said, "You know what, this process has been far too painful and I just want to go now, so take the item off so I can leave." This arrogant tool, gives me the passive-aggressive mean spirited "Just trying to help" line before turning away. His arrogance was almost like he was happy he won this apparent battle in his mind's eye. Ridiculous! Yea you won...you won me spending my $400.00 using Amazon Prime" you idiot.   One last SNAFU for me was when the supervisor comes back and hands me a VOID receipt...yea you guessed it again, he voided the entire order and not just the iPod Touch taken off as I requested (all in front of the "Manager" too I might add). Walked out completely empty handed and drove home.    The three hour tour. I vow to never shop at this store ever again as there customer service is on par with the Department of Motor Vehicles.

I didn't even get to stay here as I never got passed the phone call stage. Guy on the phone was somewhat rude and kept interrupting me asking to transfer my call before I could fully state my question. Gal that answered the phone after transfer was also rather short with me. I inquired about booking a room but first had questions about the pool, namely that I read that there is no shade at the pool. She too interrupted me and said "there's no shade at the pool or cabanas." I asked again, "no shade at all? No umbrellas?" and she said "there's no shade."  After an awkward silence...I said goodbye and hung up. I can't believe in AZ they have no shade. In a pic online I saw umbrellas and cabanas...so not sure what to believe. I ended up booking the Scottsdale Resort instead. The marketing department over there should be mad as hell and spitting nails to have a customer ready to book be treated like that.  Guess I'm probably dodging a bullet anyhow.

I've tried to go here like 3 or 4 times and its always been far too busy and tooooo long of a wait. Went in for lunch today and got a seat right away. We ordered a WISEGUY- Wood-Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage. WOW! Loved it. The dough they make for the pizzas is something I've never had before and I lived in NY for quite a while. My wife was a bit disappointed as it didn't have red sauce on it and she wasn't aware of it when we ordered. So we ordered the Sonny Boy to go for dinner tonight. My only negatives (not enough to ding a star rating) were that I'm diabetic and ordered a cappuccino and they don't offer sweetener...only Sugar in the Raw. I understand "keeping it real" but it kinda sucks for people like me. I hate being forced to pay for parking too (Parked 30 feet from entrance)...just the way I am. Regardless, this was rock-star pizza!

Fogo e Brasa  Cool looking place. I felt like I had entered the "Enchanted Tiki Room" at Disneyland when I walked in.   This is an awesome joint for a carnivore such as me. Service started out brilliant but ended in a bit of a thud for us and those around us.   I took a seat at the bar and was immediately greeted by a very friendly bartender. He recommended a Brazilian Beer to me that I can't remember the name of but was like a chocolate stout. It was awesome. This bar keep was on top of his game as he explained the whole Brazilian BBQ theme in great detail. I was getting hungry just listening to him and wishing my wife would get there already so we can eat. Thought that was a great "go the extra mile" service from him.   The service from our waiter started off great and he also took time to explain everything in detail. He also made recommendations to our preferences. Later when we were eating he asked if I liked spicy sauces and then said he would be back in a moment - he returned with a chili and olive oil side that was wonderful.  The only negative issue with the service is they all fell in the "weeds" busy.   The food runners delivering the meats to the table became rather scarce as well at the end of the meal. Granted this place was packed and people waiting at the bar to be seated. We overheard one of the runners say to a guest "Sorry we're busy and just really understaffed."   Toward the end of the meal our server was rarely seen - a contrast to the beginning of the meal. The table next to us (an 8 top) was getting rather pissed off when the server came 25 minutes after a man ordered his beer and asked him again if he wanted another beer. I ordered another glass of wine and it took over 20 minutes for the waiter to bring it.   There also was a long gap between the end of the meal and the check process. I found this rather surprising because of all the guests waiting to be seated at the bar.   With all that said, the food was wonderful.   The waiter explained that there are 3 different salad stations - a cold salad station, a traditional salad station and a specialty salad station. The latter was awesome as it had crab legs, mussels, and scallops, as well as, a shrimp salad, chicken salad etc. I blew my carnivorous horn loudly as I attacked this cornucopia of proteins from the sea. There also was a hot appetizer section that was equally great. It had a coconut tilapia that was exceptional. I usually don't like coconut dishes as they are to sweet but this was not sweet and its creamy sauce really represented the coconut flavor well.  There was egg plant parmegiana that looked like a sloppy mess but had good flavor. Next was a meatloaf dish that that was sliced into medallions. It was alright - a bit dry. Last they had a chafing dish of black beans. It was nothing special to look at but ZOWEEEIII what flavor. Not sure what they put in these black beans but it was a favorable favorite.   Now comes the food runners delivering spickets of food to the table - 16 different kinds of grilled meats. There was turkey breast wrapped in bacon, prime rib, lamb, top sirloin, BBQ chicken, garlic chicken, chicken breast, beef ribs, pork ribs, pork loin, pineapple, tri tip, sausages, ham, chicken hearts etc. WOW!  My favorites were the MR lamb, tri tip and best was the top sirloin. The top sirloin had this seasoned thin layer of fat on the inside that was spiced wonderfully and made the meat incredible.   Lastly, a very nice attractive woman rolls over a cart of homemade confections. I haven't seen an actual "Rolling Dessert Cart" since I was a waiter at the Sheraton in New York in the 80's. Nonetheless, it sold my wife who ordered the chocolate mousse cake which she said was decadent.   I rolled out of here literally full for 2 days. Zen Tiki gives Fogo e Brasa the double thumbs up!

Very disappointed with this place. My wife called to validate that we would be able to use trade scrip at the facility and the employee said we absolutely would be able to. She packs up all the kids and their friends and heads over there. When they arrive she is told a completely different story. There's a line of people waiting to get in so they mutually agree that she will pay and discuss later. Called later to resolve and the employee on the phone was rather rude when asking for a manger. Questioning as to why. Why? Because i want to speak with a manager. Spoke with the manager and was rather unfriendly to and somewhat uncompromising. Said he would try and resolve with the company with the scrip and would call me call later that day. Both proved to be untrue. Never gave me a courtesy call back. He told me he would try and resolve, told the scrip company no way would he resolve. That's just deceptive in my book. Say one thing to the customer and then do the opposite. Will never go back - no time for people like that.  Wife said food was bad, outdated, cold and stale. Servers were loud and several times dropping plates, loudly dropping bev racks which she said was disturbing. She said overall it was a very bad experience from beginning to end.

My sales director and I went in here for a quick biz lunch the other day. Good vibe walking in and friendly staff who shouted out seating instructions to us. Fast wi-fi was a bonus. Waitress (maybe manager or owner)  was a crazy col lady and helped us through the order process and some special lamb items we wanted ordered on the side. Gave us a free soup that was a surprise and tasty. My friend really liked the shrimp we ordered but it was a bit sweet for me. We also ordered lamb kabobs which he also liked but were a bit on the well side for me - tasty nonetheless. Gave it the extra star because we left with the feeling it's a cool place and wanting to come back and order something else. Cool BBQ store next door too.

Oregano's Pizza Gilbert  What can you say...best pizza joint in the city. You NEVER leave this place without a smile. They have all three of the essential triumvirate of a successful eating establishment - Great Fun Atmosphere, Awesome Food with Ample Selections,  & Nearly Perfect Service.   My young daughter loves that they give her a glob of pizza doe to play with at the table. She made an octopus on this occasion. I have an Oregano's Beer Mug that I bring in for discounted draft refills. They have an awesome house draft beer which I can't recall the name of it - we'll call it Oregano Brew - anyhow it's a great beer.   I love pizza but with some diet restrictions can't usually eat it. Wooohoo...they have thin crust WHOLE WHEAT crust...thanks Oregano's! We had it with pepperonis and their wonderful tasting sausage.   I watched as my girls devoured the Oreganos PAZOOOOKIE dessert. If you haven't had this dessert then you just don't know...hands down the best dessert EVER! It's a 1/2 baked chocolate chip cookie in a skillet with homemade vanilla ice cream..wow! Zipps Sports Grill also serves a version of this dessert as well.  Service was good besides a couple of waiter blunders. Managent was very friendly and accommodating. Manager Fran (male) is an awesome cat...so if you go ask for Fran and tell 'em Zenn sent ya!!!!

DISHONEST STAFF & TWO SEPARATE BUNGLED HOTEL EXPERIENCES  This was our second visit here as the staff bungled the first visit in July so horribly bad that we were offered to come back and stay again. Actually that's not really correct either as when we first stayed there we checked out after only being there for 2 1/2 hours and had paid and not been reimbursed. No call back from management. They sent an e-mail bot "how was your stay?" only THEN a manager calls. I told him (Robert) my wife wouldn't be interested in returning. He pleaded and said that he would personally assure a wonderful experience.  When I called to book, Robert did not return 3 calls that I had made requesting the room. Yes 3 calls. I then called the front desk asked the gal to book a room with the voucher tells me she has a room with two beds. I said that doesn't work for my wife and I. She then tells me one king is available but for like $35.00 more. So yes there was one available, they just want to extort some extra $. So I'm thinking, "This place screwed up badly, begged us to come back and then wants to nickel and dime me for a king bed,"   On that note, integrity is very important to me and this hotel has a dishonest staff.  If one thing happens, well meh. 2 things happen its alarming. 3 and 4 things happen, well, I'm pissed off. The pool bartender was nice. I was given 3 rounds of drinks while seated there and he only charged for 1. Yea, I hear folks screaming, "What are you complaining about?" Well, it's dishonest and it's stealing. I don't like thieves and didn't ask for free drinks nor did I expect them. I never walk in to Macy's to buy a shirt and expect the clerk to give me a tie and belt for free do I?   This experience really sucks because I really really wanted to like this place as I have a liking to mid-century kitschy cool design and this place fits that bill. Rooms are retro-eclectic and nice. I hurt my back prior to coming here and was rather annoyed that no one told us that there were no elevators so I had to lug luggage up stairs which irritated me. I understand it's an older building but staff should have said something prior. It is a LONG HAUL  from your room to go get ice. I also went to the restaurant to ask for a spoon as my wife had some Ben & Jerrys and the server was rude. Otherwise we checked out without incidence - I thought.   My wife comes to me a couple days later and asks me what the $50.00 charge was. So I call the hotel to inquire Kristen told me I was charged for a bottle of Belvedere Vodka. I assured her that we did not drink it. She said it would be refunded. I told her I was disturbed that I was charged for this without asking and asked why and she said, "Well obviously...somebody as in our minibar department went into your room or it was just a mistaken room number ...or anything could have happened. But we'll get it sorted out for you." I said, "OK Please do" and guessed that was the end of it.  I also wasn't very satisfied with the "anything could have happened" explanation.   To me this is quite sneaky to charge a customer's credit card in this fashion without consent and explanation. It's not like they don't have my e-mail and/or phone number to inform me of the charge. That's dishonest. My guess would also be an integrity issue again with the Hotel Valley Ho staff for missing liquor.   I was never reimbursed.  I call back AGAIN 3 weeks later and Brian said that he would take my name and number and call me back with information. The same Brian called me back a half hour later and abruptly asked, "What was the issue?" and in a somewhat curt tone. I explained the situation again and told him the charges were supposed to be reversed and weren't. He then said in a snarky fashion, "Fine, if you didn't take it home with you then I'll reimburse it to your Visa." At this point I'm really angry as he said it in tone implying that I might be lying about it. Nice way to treat your customers.   Well, guess what? Yea, Brian never reversed the charges. Twice they said they would reverse the charges and didn't; feels really dishonest at this point. It's only $50 bucks but to me it's the principle of the continued dishonesty and then having to spend 20 minutes more on the phone with my bank filing a "charge dispute" was time consuming and once again irritating. I have much better things to do then waste time with the Hotel Valley Ho's bungling.

We were each extremely impressed by the food at this establishment.  We decided to try the Sirloin Sliders as our appetizer course.  The portion size was immense for an appetizer, but the flavor was spectacular.  Even without the horseradish and au jus, the meat and Cajun onion straws had very good flavor; however, when combining those two sides, the dish was a perfect blend of savory flavor and heat.    For entrées, we ordered the Chicken & Pesto Fetish and the Pulled Pork Sandwich respectively.  The chicken sandwich was fantastic, served on a toasted ciabatta roll with a very tasty pesto spread.  The chicken was moist and flavorful, and was complimented nicely by the saltiness of the feta, an interesting choice for such a sandwich.  It was delicious.  The pulled pork sandwich was equally impressive.  The pork was full of nice smoky flavor, but what made the sandwich most interesting was the coleslaw topping the sandwich off and adding a totally unexpected texture and flavor.

Well it's been several years since we have eaten at this restaurant. Not since the rigatoni's people owned it. We used to enjoy this place quite a bit as the food was good, patio ambiance was nice, and the service is usually spot on.  Only one Sunday afternoon tried again with the new ownership and left a bit disappointed. As mentioned above, the Trinity of restaurant experience of ambiance, food and service are necessary for good experience; however, if one is missing, and drastically missing here, experience is just marred.  We took a seat on the patio and were not greeted for 15 min. yes 15 full minutes sitting alone like hobo Joes. I kind of felt like leaving and going next door to dos gringos. The server finally approached was far from enthusiastic seemed like almost annoyance to her to be waiting tables this afternoon. Almost zombielike, probably just hung over. In fact all the service staff that I viewed seem to have this zombielike hangover.  Anyhow, I asked her about the bloody Mary's and they were good as I assume they should be a roadhouse and she said, "the other awesome this bartender makes a really good." I smiled and happily agreed and waited in anticipation for this bloody Mary of greatness. She left and we see her again for almost 15 min. which is absurd. When she did come back to the table she didn't have my drink she just wanted to take the food order simply said, "you ready?" Not much the menu lead huh. She took our food order and didn't offer an appetizer before leaving so I had to call her back to order one. Still no bloody Mary.  When the bloody Mary did arrive we have been seated for about 27 min. yes 27 min. to get a drink. What's more disappointing is how awful the drink was. I'm not particularly picky as I felt you can't really mess up a bloody Mary but they sure did. Came out in a small plastic tumbler glass and literally tasted like tomato juice with barely any spice in it and no garnish whatsoever. It looked really sad and tasted sad. What really pissed me off was about 15 feet away there was a couple of guys seating at the bar who have bloody Mary's in glass pint glasses with a salted rim and a bunch of garnishes with some celery stalk and you can see from the color of the drink that it was made like a bloody Mary. REALLY!! It really sucks and I totally felt cheated. Restaurants without consistency drive me crazy. A Big Mac in Boston is the same as a Big Mac in San Diego. Your drinks and food should be the same.   The food runner or cook came to our table with an appetizer of sliders and said, "your sliders." I told him that we an order that that we ordered shrimp and he said, "what you mean?" I found that almost comical statement as it reiterated to him that we had ordered shrimp not sliders. About 5 min. later shrimp came out. This is where I have a hard time deciphering between two and three stars for this place because the food is really good. The Cajun shrimp drunken appetizer was outstanding. I even thought of ordering one to go for later on.  I had a Rubin and my mom had meatloaf. My mom's diabetic and can have a lot of sugar and the meatloaf came out with huge blobs of barbecue sauce on it. I'm not sure that was my mistake and I didn't read the menu correctly but I don't think I would have missed that. Anyhow we scraped off the barbecue sauce and my mom absolutely love smoky flavored meatloaf she commented about three times how good it was. My Reuben sandwich also was very good with an ample stacking of meat which I appreciated. Coleslaw was obviously fresh and had a good flavor but lacked the will of the seasoning and punch. Again food was outstanding. No doubt about that.  After the appetizer was served I had seen that they have Corona light on tap so I ordered one. 20 min. to get a beer and I was nearly finished with my meal when it came. This is stupid.  The only other negative was that the facility needs a bit of a facelift noticed was the same furniture from four or five years ago and it's starting to show.  Bottom line I probably won't go back because I can't deal with atrocious service.

Service was for the most part prompt but I think that's about all the positive I can say. Actually the coffee was good too. We went here for breakfast the other day as I saw the 4 star review. My wife had chicken fried steak and was rather bland and had too much gravy on it. Home fires were pretty good though. I had corned beef hash and eggs - not nearly enough corned beef served. The kicker was within an hour of leaving, we both became sick. Not crazy vomiting sick, but nauseous like you feel like your going to vomit sick - gurgling belly with heart burn.  My best guess as we ordered different items was a dirty kitchen grill.

WOW! We absolutely love this place! I've had a gift card for this place for 2 years now and hadn't used it. We pulled up in the lot (behind a gas station and next to a Vet office) and it looked empty, so we turned out noses up and left and went to Serrano's instead up the street. BIG FRIGGIN' MISTAKE as we found out 2 years later.   The food in this place is outrageously good and authentic. My wife is Hispanic from New Mexico and she was speechless about the food.   What caught my eye first was the picture of the Mexican Shrimp Cocktail on the back menu cover - no doubt to order that baby up and it didn't disappoint whatsoever - just the right amount of heat and flavor. Superb. Now I've ordered this twice. Both times the flavor was consistent. The first time it lacked a bit on the shrimp volume from what I would expect but the 2nd time it was full of them.   We also ordered the appetizer platter. We usually liek to order this as it sampel many of the featured appetizers. Many times, in Mex Restaurants, this comes out/tasting rather generic looking. This plate was the real McCoy. Everything was authentic and home-made; nothing boxed here. The most unusual aspect were the potato skins. Fresh potatoes hollowed out and filled with...ready...one with home-made red chili beef and the other with green chili pork. My eyes nearly popped out and the taste buds validated it.   Whenever I go to a new joint, I always ask what the best thing on the menu is and on this occasion I was told, "Well, the best thing actually isn't on the menu. It's a special order chipotle cream shrimp dish." I felt like I snuck into a foodie speak-easy...sign me up for that one! Big fat plump prawns in a zesty cream sauce - this is now on the monthly rotation; hands down. No rice, sub-veggie, along with re-fried cheesy beans completed the plate. Veggies were a surprise of fajita veg mixed with peas and mushrooms - awesome!  My wife raved about the home made sopapillas too and can't wait to bring her mother to this place.   Here's the knock and most likely why this place isn't burning busy with customers - the service is bad - consistently bad. You're either waiting un-godly amounts of time, or being inundated with courses. The first time we went was on a Tuesday I believe. Place was a bit busy but certainly not off the rails - but the staff was. They were truly in "the weeds." Took forever to order and forever + eternity to get a bar drink. I wised up the next time and ordered 2 beers instead of one ($2 Negro Modelos - yes that isn't a typo). Issue here was it was a school night and our 9 year old was with us and teh Sloooooooooooowww service was know making a time pinch as there's school tomorrow. It was painful HOWEVER the owner Mario is so charmingly nice, and with the food being so good, it warranted a repeat attendance.   The 2nd time was the opposite. The waitress took our order and I specifically said I wanted the Mex Shrimp cocktail first, then we would like the app platter before the meal. You guessed it - EVERYTHING on the table within 5 minutes of each other. 3 dinner plates and 2 appetizers along with chips and salsa. Inundated table.   Hopefully Mario can address the service issues. If he does, this restaurant would definitly run off the charts. My other suggestion would be to add Sunday Mariachis. We'd be there every week if they did.

I absolutely love this place. We accidentally discovered it nestled in the strip mall when we moved to Gilbert last year. I felt like I was walking into one of those corner deli restaurants back in Upstate New York. The staff is incredibly friendly and the owner "Sal" introduced himself while I waited at the bar having a Moretti Draft Beer. He's a really friendly guy and offered my wife and 7 year old some garlicky baked dough knots while we waited. What was even cooler was that he gave us a package of free home made sugary doughnuts when we left. WOW! This place rocks!  The food is fantastic and made fresh.  Our favorite is the large pizza (be sure and try their sausage) and wing combination to-go and it's an on-going special for like $20. Can't beat that.

Absolutely incredible this place is. The food is so fresh they grow it mostly on the farm there. Sashimi grade tuna sandwich was out of this world. Great place to bring out of town guests.

Sat at the bar and had absolutely wonderful service. Boy does that make such a difference. Friendly and knowledgable without being intrusive.    We did happy hour. I had a flight of their house beers. Really liked their Hefeweizen; crisp and tasty.   We had the wings buffalo style M with blue cheese sub for ranch. My wife didn't like them saying they were soggy. I thought they were ok but rather scrawny. They need larger ramekins to dip in too.   I had the 5 meat deep dish and I was astonished how good it was. Really thick with the meat.   Again bartenders Edith and Corey were outstanding. If we lived near by I would come back just for their service.

This place just really shoots itself in the food with the absolutely atrocious service & lazy food fumbles.   We sat at the bar & waited for the bartender & waited & waited. My wife turns to me & says, "I think we're on the pay no mind list." Finally she comes over & blurts out, "Drinks?" That's it. I replied back with one word, "water." All these beers & this chick had nothing to promote. She also didn't offer us a menu.   We finally got menus. Barkeep continued her one word service spiel blurting out "food?" I said we would start with the Cilantro Lime Hummus. Without comment, she left.   The presentation of the appetizer was ok. A large pool of oil floating on top of the green hummus.- not attractive. Nice flavor & the cilantro, which I love, stood out. Menu says it is served with their "delicious beer bread." Not sure what "beer bread" is but unless its tortilla chips or pita bread, it was absent. The chips were good, but, like I said, it wasn't beer bread. There were some small tomatoes on the plate that were wrinkly with age & should never have been put on the plate. Some really tasty black olives were great.   The bartender never offered a beer so I had to ask her. I pointed to some taps on the back bar & asked her what they were & she just said "we don't have that right now" without answering my question. I then asked her if they had draft beer "flights" & she looked at me like I was from Mars, & then said, "Oh, do you mean a beer sampler?" I agreed & asked her what they were & she pointed at a chalk board & said "those over there." She then said, "Here's the menu but it has all the wrong beers listed. Here's a placement but it has all the wrong beers listed too. God I wish they'd get new ones." She then, shockingly, took the time to explain them to me; however, when she picked up the Sunspot Gold sample, she spilled it into the stout & then just shrugged her shoulders as if to say "oh well." She continued, "This is our IPA, it's strong & tastes like rubbing alcohol." Oh, I'll look forward to that one. She continued, "This is our seasonal Winter Brew. It's old, like from November when we made it, so it's like I said, old, & we're trying to get rid of it so try & order it. It's got like 10% alcohol & will knock you on your ass." She also picked up every single beer sample glass by the rim with her fingers.   She was right the IPA had a rubbing alcohol after taste. The winter brew also was hard core strong. It almost tasted like someone poured friggin' vodka in it. The Hefeweisen was awesome, with a nice after taste of bananas -really liked it. I also really liked the Sun Devil ale.     The sandwiches came out &looked rather tired. Both plates were garnished with pieces of red onion & a sliced tomato; generic looking. Come on, pieces of red onion thrown on there, quit being lazy & slice the friggin onion will ya. Her plate looked rather sad & she said to me, "Honey, my plate seriously needs some love. I at least need some lettuce garnish." I agreed. Our bartender never did a check back so I had to wave her down & ask her for some lettuce. "The cooks told me the lettuce order just came in." Are you kidding me? Come up with a better lie than that. She hated it (Cajun chicken) & ate 3 bites. Near the end of the meal the bartender walked by & said "good?" & I told her "mine is, but my wife doesn't like her's." She said, "oh" & turned & walked away without asking what was wrong.     My ground lamb & blue cheese stuffed burger was awesome. I also had asked that they not overcook the lamb & they didn't. MR & oozing with blue cheese! I had the chili with it which was rather blah. It had an ice cream scoop size of sour cream blotted into the small soup cup. Also stupid from a food cost perspective.    When the bartender cleared the plates, she failed to ask how everything was. She picked up my wife's plate, looked at the uneaten food, shrugged her shoulders & threw it out. Never asked if we wanted to bring it home either. Just threw it out. Still on the bill.  I still wanted to have another beer. My wife said, "NO WAY, I'm not sitting her one more second with this crappy service. This chick sucks & I can't take it anymore" How do you argue with that? So we left. We'll never be back either.   A lot of waiting, pulling teeth for any kind of service & a general feeling of being uncomfortable. Great place with awesome potential, but they really shoot themselves in the foot.

Cantina Laredo at The San Tan Mall  We were taking our daughter to see a movie at the San Tan and never have dined at Cantina Laredo, so we decided to give it a try. We were thoroughly impressed with the general facility and the attention to detail that it contains; eclectic with Spanish overtones. The place was immaculate.   The food was fantastic! I had the Cantina Laredo Platter: Cheese chile relleno, tamale, chicken enchilada, fajita beef taco al carbon. I thoroughly enjoyed this plate. The relleno was super gooey cheesy and the beef in the taco was exceptional and reminded me of something my mother-in-law would make when we travel to New Mexico.    The glaring problem with this restaurant is the service. It was absolutely terrible. When we sat down it was nearly 15 minutes before we were greeted. The server never mentioned any specials and was not knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a Queso dip for the table which was good but not exceptional; however, I was extremely irritated when I overheard the server at the next table offer tableside Guacamole to his guests. HELLO! WTF! I love guacamole.  Then I sat irritated in my chair as I watched the neighbor's guacamole being prepared fresh tableside....eeeerrrrrr. In addition, our Queso dip came out late and our dinners early as the courses were annoyingly overlapped. Why even bother ordering an appetizer if you don't get a chance to eat it.   My wife has a sweet tooth and always looks forward to dessert. Not here though as we got the automatic check drop without being asked for coffee or dessert.   My wife and daughter went shopping before the movie so I moved to the bar to test the house margaritas. I never got to because I sat at the bar by myself for exactly 18 minutes without ever being greeted let alone served. So I got up and left and went to Kona Grill for a drink instead. By the way, a Gaggle of hostesses all up front and not one mentioned to say goodbye.   Wow! Great place, Great food and then this place really shoots itself in the foot with its absolutely lousy service.

I'm so done with this place. I ordered for the last time the other day as they are scammers. We order to-go food from here because they actually put out a rather tasty product but the process is just way too painful. Just placing the order is an incredible task as the people answering the phone speak next to know English.  Don't dare tag me a racist as I'm far from that but it's reality that you need to convey an order and have it made correctly - that's basic. To exacerbate this their on-line menu is conveniently numbered but it's THE WRONG ONE further adding to the confusion. What a hot mess. The last few orders we have gotten home and the order is wrong...errrrr! The topper is the last two times they have tried to scam when we had a coupon and that is where the line gets drawn when you lack integrity with your customers.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL4Amj0F2Pk&feature=g-upl&context=G2f125afAUAAAAAAALAA

Okay, we've been to this place twice now and both visits were very successful. They have really good quality food and the plates that they serve our enormous! I can't imagine what their food cost must be. Anyhow both times we went for breakfast. The first time I had eggs Benedict and the soft-boiled eggs were cooked perfect and the hollandaise sauce was creamy buttery and wonderful. Last week I had the corned beef hash and it was fresh and wonderful; it must be made in house. The coffee is very good as well. The ding on the star level comes from the unpredictable service as it can be slow at times; especially when you want to check to pay and leave. Overall this place is a home-run and we'll put it on the rotation even though there are quite a few breakfast places hearing Gilbert AZ.

Good time. We sat at the sushi bar and were entertained. We brought my 9 year old very picky daughter and she had fun. She has some edamame and a plate of plain noodles. Sticking me for 5 bucks for a small pile of plain noodles I felt was outrageous. Sushi was good and rolls were fantastic. Asked the sushi chef to make his favorite and it was a spicy tuna roll with a sweet sauce that was awesome. We'll come back, but I'll give me daughter a hot dog before we go.

Blue Wasabi San Tan  I bellied up to the bar here and was immediately greeted by a smiling happy bartender. Very nice gal (From Tampa Florida) and she handed me a menu and explained about the happy hour special. I perused the menu and was shocked at the happy hour value. Kirin Light 'biggies' for 3 bucks and add a jumbo size Sake for a buck and a  1/2 - are you kidding me. I sat near the service well and the bartender would give me "tasters" from the excess in the shaker of all the colorful martinis she was making. Great stuff.   I ordered 4 items to eat. BBQ Drunken Shrimp, Chicken Skewers, White Tuna Sashimi, and Cajun Tuna Sashimi.   BBQ Drunken Shrimp - great looking item. A jumble of marinated shrimp cooked perfectly on a platter of thin tangy BBQ sauce. Served with some nice toast points to soak up the delicious sauce.   Chicken Skewers - item was satisfactory. It had a nice presentation however it wasn't chicken breast but rather darker chicken that was cut and skewered on sections on to the stick. It had a nice sauce and was accompanied by a ramekin of dried chilis and powdered chili pepper and tasted fine. Only issue again was the non white meat.   White Tuna Sashimi - my least favorite of the four. The meat was cut a bit to thin; however, was fresh. The orange and ginger sauce was near non-existent. Not terrible item but not real memorable either.   Cajun Tuna Sashimi - Awesome item. Good quality cut of fished seared perfectly on the outside and sliced ruby red on the inside. Fanned out on the plate it looked great. Only issue was that the sauce was good but not enough of it. Real bargain for six bucks.   My friendly neighbors at the bar ordered the appetizer mushrooms which looked fantastic and I will definitely try them next time.   Great Service - Great Ambiance - Great Food

This was our second time dining here and both times visits have been absolutely fantastic! The food and the quality are very good. Everything that we have eaten in this restaurant has been superb. The last time I went I had a rib-eye that was fantastic. The time before I had the four course chef meal and it was also fantastic. What's really need is to give you tickets to go on a gondola ride after the meal, unfortunately, the last time we went it was raining but they gave us vouchers to come back another time. Service was spot on and I really recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Wow! Knock out punch good. We've lived in Gilbert for 5 years and have missed out on this gem as I usually only go to 4 star rate or above places. Don't be fooled by the lower star rating as that was marred I guess from a previous owner. This place is rock star and will be put on our permanent regular rotation. The food was outstanding in quality. It's a little pricy for portions, but I didn't go here for a buffet and prefer quality over quantity, so keep that in mind cheapy-charlies out there.  Artichoke dip = fantastic. Baked Brie = fantastic fantastic.  Veggie flat bread = fantastic to the 3rd power.   Wine flights Yea! Loved them! I had a Pinot Noir flight AND a Arizona Red Wine Flight. GM talked to us for 10+ minutes discussing/educating about wine - he knows his stuff. Female bartender was great; although she never told us her name. Bartender Blake was great. these guys seem to love their jobs which reflects in the superb service.   Oh! and live blues jazz guitar that was awesome! Perfect for the eclectic cool setting. Feel like a total heel as we didn't tip him as I only had $1 in my wallet (thanks to pilfering wife and kid - leave me a dollar in my wallet, what kinda sh!t is that huh) and wasn't going to flip the guy a buck. Guess I'll double him up next time.

Very disappointing with food and service. Ordered their standard burger and server delivered us the wrong plates. Drop and run without asking us for anything else or describing the dish. After we switched plates I had ordered MR and came out M-MW but moreover the meat was just really bland and void of flavor. The burger had like a 1/4 head of lettuce on it too I guess to give it a vertical volume perception. Server never said what the red lumpy sauce on the side was either and when I finally had to call him over to ask if it had sugar in it as I'm diabetic he said no but it sure tasted as if it did.   The worst part was some server dumped ketchup all down the back of my shirt and then just walked away leaving me there with a huge red splatter on my back. She literally just walked away. About a minute later a girl comes by and says "someone will be by to clean you off in a little bit." What!?!?!? Now I understand that mistakes will happen but to leave me hanging there like that and just walk away was not cool. No manager visit and no apology from anyone about the spill or ruining my shirt.   What really pissed me off though, was the gaggle of servers who gathered near the soda machine and all started laughing and giggling about my misfortune. That was seriously not cool. Of course no manager visit as no manager was seen and the service in this restaurant reflects that lack of leadership. Crappy service and bland food - will never return.

We've lived in Gilbert about six years and unfortunately I had no idea this restaurant was even here. What a gem! As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a jovial Tony behind the counter who also quickly introduced his brother saying, "and over there's my brother Mikey!" It is really reminded me of the eight years that I lived in New York. In my opinion you three things for a successful restaurant: good service, ambience, good food. The brothers immediately established the service end of that equation. The ambience was cool to as they were playing Sinatra and other big-band type music and adorned on the walls were pictures of famous New Yorkers and whatnot. The food didn't disappoint either as it  looked and tasted authentic New York. These guys get it about good service and that means a lot to me. We will definitely be back.

What an awful experience. Pizza was rather good however, the service at this place is abysmal. We thought that the menu was lacking in options and seemed rather limited. With the lack of options on the menu it's hard to feed picky children. You don't want to cater to them? well, we'll go somewhere else. However, that was the least of the issues with this disaster experience.   Anti-pasta as a starter was fresh and nice and we ordered the pizza it came out hot and tasted nice and fresh. I liked the pizza as I used to live in NY, but my wife didn't.   Service at the table was somewhat slow too. Forgot our bar order and then it took nearly 10 minutes to get it when we reminded the sever about it. I was nearly done eating when it arrived.   Server auto-check dropped with no offer of dessert. So my wife and the kids went across the way to Frost Ice Cream for dessert and I went to the bar to have a glass of wine and watch the game. I sat at the bar for seven minutes without being greeted and nearly walked out. The bartender in passing then said "did you want to eat something?" and I said no I had already eaten I want to have a glass of wine. She brought me the menu for food and beer but no wine list. I ended up sitting there another 12 MINUTES before she addressed me again saying "you need something?" REALLY, nearly 20 minutes at the bar empty handed and she wonders if I need something.    With that said, I had set our leftover pizza box on the bar when I sat down. While I was seated the bartender took it off the bar top and put it underneath the bar. I didn't think much of it as I suspected that she put it there for safekeeping and to free up bar space.   Anyhow, it took nearly 20 minutes from the time I sat down to the time I got a glass of wine which in my opinion is absolutely ridiculous. In the time that my wife the kids were gone I probably would've had two glasses of wine and a Sambuca but I barely had time to finish the one glass. I went to tab out and this also took way too long as my wife and the kids stood behind me at the bar waiting for 10 minutes while I tabbed out. Once this painstaking process was finished she took the check presenter and walked away without comment or eye contact. I had to call her back and say, "hey, can I have my pizza so we can go please?" She then looked at me with the quizzical face and said, "What pizza?" I reminded her of my pizza she put under the bar and she returned, "oh, I didn't know that was yours I threw it out." I looked at her and said, "There was half of a large pizza in there." She looked at me with a blank stare and said, "I can have you made a personal pizza and only take about 10 minutes?" I said no that's not acceptable. First, I had a half large pizza in there and second, we have to go now because the kids have school in the morning." She said "oh okay" and then turns her back on us and goes to the register without further comment. Offering no further solution to the problem she created. I found that absolutely astonishing and insulting. To throw my pizza away and then give me a lame solution was stupid. (The pizza we ordered was like 25 or $28 and personal pizzas is like 10 bucks) To just turn your back on us and leave us standing there like Hobo Joe's was really incredible and surreal.  I'll never come back to this place. I dropped $125 in this pizza joint and left really pissed off.   Lastly, one of my employees had been dining with us and he was so upset he called the manager. The manager asked him for my name and address and said that he would contact me to discuss what had happened. Whatever, I didn't really care anymore and just simply won't ever go back. There's lot of places to spend money at. Like a week later I got a $25 gift card in the mail with absolutely no explanation, no letter, no contact name, and no verbiage whatsoever except my name scribbled on it - and they misspelled my friggin name as well.  All this really insulted me a 2nd time. Like throwing a gift card at me remedies that crappy experience. I threw their lame offering in the trash. Hope your happy with my $125.00 as you'll never see a cent out of us again.

My wife has been wanting to bring me here to check it out so we did today. She usually goes to the one in Chandler but she thought we'would check this one out instead as it was closer.   The ambiance of the place left a bit to be desired in my opinion. It didn't seem to have any central theme. Seriously, what's with the metal bull and matador in the men's room...hmmm. Anyhow, there are no booths which I hate - except a couple of half booth tables that were already taken. The music was too soft & low so you can hear people's conversations around you. So yea, I got a couple of eye ball daggers thrown at me. Some woman let her 2 kids run around the dining room like it was Chucky Cheese.   Food was actually rather good, even though it was difficult for me to come up with a good selection with the diet I'm on. We had an appetizer of humus that was artfully displayed on the plate with a dichotomous split  down the middle with jalapeño cilantro humus on one side and red pepper humus on the other. My wife had the pita bread with it and ordered me some cucumber chips to dip - awesome stuff. You guys have that jalapeño cilantro humus nailed.   My wife had a Caribbean salad which looked like it was plucked fresh off the Chiquita Banana Ladies hat. Good looking artfully designed plate. She liked it.   I had a grilled chicken salad and asked for feta cheese on top. Salad looked great but our Patrick Dempsey looking server bolted before I could ask him for additional dressing. I forget that places like this literally spritz a single mist of vinaigrette on the salad in fear of offending Suzy slender bones that she's fat.  Server McDempsey was no where to be found as I waited and waited painstakingly eating the dry salad. He got there eventually and I asked him for the dressing and he said, "Sure man." Then he went to the busser station and talked with someone, got a drink, rang an order, bussed some plates, and then got my dressing - dude Dempsey WTF.   The place left a bit to be desired but the food was good. In my opinion you need good food, ambient atmosphere, and efficient service - 1 out of 3 in these economic times ain't bringing me back in.  Moreover, the management staff needs to have a refresher course in hygiene with its employees. Now I'm no clean freak what-so-ever, Christ I used to drink out of the friggin' garden hose when I was a kid - ah who am I kidden, I still do.  Anyhow, I'm looking over at a table with a woman who just sneezed all over the top of her drink - allergies I guess. Well she gets up and leaves and the petite bus girl comes up and bussed the tables and sticks her fingers inside of three glasses in order to carry them away to the bus station. She comes out with a clean rag to wipe the table and fresh silverware roll ups in the soiled hand - nice... Even worse I'm watching server McDempsey talk to another guy employee while he's running his fingers through his gelled hair, scratching his scalp and then rubs his nose with his thumb and index finger. He then goes and serves plates of food to the people next to us. Only good thing - the customer was the frigid woman who shot me the stink eye earlier. Here's to hair gel in your pita lady.

We stayed here last night with the groupon special. The wife and I were going to book somewhere else for a one night staycation but decided to book this special. I worked at this resort for several years in the late 1980s as a banquet manager. I absolutely loved that job and loved this resort; a lot of good times, and that lots of great people. Anyhow, I felt that it would be a good vacation, really affordable, and a trip down memory lane with nostalgia. When we arrived it was as if nothing had ever changed. Literally! Literally nothing is changed since the late 1980s and the resort shows it. I really found it sad disconcerting to see that they've let this amazing resort property in Paradise Valley that overlooks incredible scenic views of Camelback Mountain fall into such poor shape and disrepair. Notwithstanding the rooms have never been updated and still have circa 1980s or 1990s televisions, and decor. But the most maddening part of this entire experience to me is just plain and simple laziness. 85% of the problems with this resort, in my opinion, were just total neglect for upkeep and cleanliness. I mean just simple things that need to be done on a regular basis to keep things clean and good curb appeal. Things like wood railings that it just rotted and not been painted in the same railings are coated with bird crap. For Christ sake get the maintenance department to just clean the bird poop. The rooms have a musty dusty smell to them and need a deep cleaning. The tub filled up with water when taking a shower. The shower head was broken. Worst of all was the extremely wafer thin tissue type toilet paper. Unbelievable to skimp on something like this.    The pool was in awful shape. Again everything seems to be in disrepair, but moreover, just short staff laziness again. The trash was overflowing and never emptied either day we were there. Towels are in short demand and the towels are rarely ever picked up off of the lawn chairs. Trash, debris and cigarette butts littered all over the cool deck. Furniture and tables dirty and sticky with gunk and debris.   Of course there was no bartender attending the oasis pool bar. That was okay as I brought my own cooler and saved probably $150.00 in a bar tab for the two days. There were other people that wanted pool bar service too. I was gracious enough to share my ice cold bounty of Miller Lite's with some of them. Maintenance guys ogling my wife in her bikini wasn't really cool either especially when they weren't even cleaning the filthy pool area. Three o'clock in the afternoon guy goes through the pool area with a blower putting a ton of dust in the air ... just stupid.  My wife walks 10 to 15 miles every day so the track around the entire resort was the one nice thing about it; however, the workout stations that they have along the path again are all in disrepair and there was a tree that had fallen over,  a palo verde that was blocking the path. We saw several quail that had baby quail following behind them which my wife thought was pretty cool.  The only reason I didn't give this place one star out of five is basically because I worked there like 28 years ago and remember what a gem of resort it used to be.  With all that said, we were told by the staff that the hotel had recently been sold and slated to be closed within a month. The Borgata shopping mall that used to center the resort has been completely leveled demolished. What a shame because it was a beautiful mall. I fear that this resort is also going to come down to the wrecking ball and I really hope it doesn't because as mentioned it really is a gem of a resort and with some proper maintenance and updating, along with its old-growth trees could really gleam once again. A good reference point would be the wigwam resort across town and how successful their renovations have been.

I love that you can buy draft beer here as the will fill up your growlers for you. Negative is you can't taste any pf the drafts before you buy. The other negative about this place is checking out is almost always PAINFULLY LONG!

Great Place! Finally a great seafood place in the Valley. Went here for lunch Monday as my wife was shopping up the street at Last Chance (which I call the Crazy Lady Store). Nice ambiance and atmosphere.   Rock Star service from bartender Heather. She went above the call of duty in her service. I really admire and make note of when a server goes the extra mile. She brought out samples of BOTH of their chowders for us to taste as they were trying new recipes. The New England Chowder was creamy goodness and out of this world. At the end of the meal she offered without prompting to put our drinks in plastic cups to go. Nice extra effort Heather.   Food:   Sourdough bread had great flavor - bit hard on the end caps though.   I had Mahi-Mahi Sliders and they were awesome! Fish seasoned and cooked perfectly. It came with a roasted 1/2 roma (?) tomato that really added flavor to the bite sandwich. Only issue is I bit into it and the friggin' tomato squirted on my shirt. Oh, the bun was also above par buttery and fluffy.   Wife ordered a burger, yes a burger in a fish house - blasphemy I say! Oh well, to each their own. Usually the last thing you want to order in a fish house; however, BWG serves a good a$$ burger. I was pleasantly surprised as my wife gave me a few bites. Bonus for ye ol' land-lovers.   Need to go back for dinner and hit that raw bar.   Double thumbs up for BWG!!

Great time here. Went hoppin' along all the places on that Chandler corridor: Sushi Eye, Murphy's, San Tan and Siracha. Bellied up to the sushi bar and was greeted by a smiling chef VJ. Really nice guy and later we discovered was the owner. Great conversation and great food.   We had a few happy hour items. We had a couple orders of dumplings that were accompanied by an incredibly tasting sauce. Edamama is edamame but it was served pipping hot and steamed just right - I don't like over cooked beans. We also had a double order of spicy tuna rolls that were out of this world. I'll go back just for that! Kirin Light saki bombs rounded off a great experience.   Thanks VJ! Great place. Look forward to checking out the patio seat too.

I was in this place yesterday for an oil change and wash. Above the POS register in the oil change area there is a white board and written on it was, "Treat every customer as if they are a mystery shopper." I found this rather ironical. I own 3 vehicles. Two of which I have brought here; one being a BMW 750Li and the other a little work truck I have a '93 Ford Ranger that is not much to look at whatsoever but a great little work truck nonetheless. Anyhow, the service with my shiny BMW was rather good. Workers treated me well. Only real complaint was interior not cleaned sufficiently for the price I paid. Yesterday I changed the oil in the work truck and got it a wash. The service when you bring a 93 Ranger is quite different than when you bring a BMW. I asked the tech if they were going to call me when everything was finished and he said that it would be done in a half hour and they would call. No one ever called me and after 45 minutes I went in garage and asked. Different employee than who I dealt with originally and had quite an attitude when I asked abut my truck. Told me it was probably on side of building and walked away. One word popped in my head "jerk." Well yes, my truck was done and parked on side of building. No one has called me as stated. Called a guy over for it, gave him my ticket and a tip and he handed me the keys. Go to the truck and the antennae isn't installed, dirt/debris on the floor, smudges on back window, receipt, promo literature and paperwork on the passenger floor, paper trash and an empty water bottle in bed of truck alog with dirt/mud...but what really pissed me off was I had some home made soup in Tupperware and in a plastic shopping bag on the passenger seat. Was bringing it to my mother. The Tupperwware was open and the container on it's side with the soup leaking into the bag and then on to the seat. Just really really careless.

Well Mr Dyer, it appears you're not conducive to constructive criticism, which is rather surprising from a stated "Operations Manager" and one who appears to be in the charge of answering customer service concerns and relations. It's a holiday today so I was out with my family having a picnic with all of our phones off. So if there was a call, I wouldn't have heard it; however, I just checked and there were no messages on my voice-mail from any Cobblestone Manager. So that looks like a truth challenge. Yelp! Is about reviewing our experiences and I reviewed your establishment about 2 very different experiences that I had for 2 separate vehicles. I brought to attention the irony of the board message in comparison to my 2 vastly different experiences. You may claim, "It does not matter what kind of vehicle they drive, we treat all customer with the up most respect" but you can't substantiate that. Your statement is a claim, mine is a fact. My claim comes from direct experiences, so like it or not, that is exactly what happened in your facility. I accept challenges, like the one presented to you, not as an attack, but as stepping stones to success and to better brand/product. That's how I roll. I have no ulterior motive in writing my review of your company. My reviews are of an altruistic nature as I trust the Yelp! reviews when I patron establishments. Your answer feels more of an attack than any sort of solution based. Moreover, as a manager, and a manager dealing with customer service, don't you feel the intelligent thing to do would be to research the issue as opposed to stating "To my understanding" without vetting and verifying what they said might be a lie? Well no Jason. I didn't tell anyone to "F-Off." That's totally absurd and would be way out of my character. You can shake your head and say I'm lying and your staff is truthful but where is my motive to lie? I have none and have asked you for nothing...so there is no motive to lie. On the other hand, your employees, who delivered sub-par service, and are defending said poor service, well, Jason, do they have a motivation to lie there? You don't have to answer; it's rhetorical. Truth challenge #2.   "We call all customers names over the intercom system.  If customer do not pick put their vehicle, we do park them off to the side" albeit this may be your policy and procedure, as a customer, it wasn't correctly conveyed to me and as a CUSTOMER it upset me that I was needlessly waiting. I asked the tech what the procedure was and if they were going to call me as I held up my phone. He said they would call me. He didn't say over a loudspeaker. Additionally I HAD TO ASK him what procedure was, he didn't offer it to me which in my OPINION would have been good customer service. Don't you feel that it's your responsibility as a business to educate your customers on your proper procedure? Again that's rhetorical Jason.   Frankly, I didn't care for your published response. It starts off with a "thank you for your review" and then quickly slides into passive/aggressive overtones sprinkled with completely false accusations. As aforementioned, I didn't solicit this response, you did. If someone would have left me a phone message, I would have called back as I'm a solution-finder not a blamer, but after your accusatory statements, well, No Thanks, I'll just never go back - ever. It's proven to me that your staff has integrity issues. Maybe you might want to look into a mirror and address the trickle-down effect of your managerial style as the apples don't seem to fall far from the tree Jason.

WOW! This place is just horrible. This isn't the first time I've had issue with their services either. They sent me an unsolicited e-mail asking to describe the experience, so I felt it necessary to fill it out as the experience really left a bad taste in my mouth. The survey link doesn't work so I e-mailed saying so and this clown  Garrett O'Dell Service Manager, e-mails me back asking about what happened so I sent this:  Was totally not happy with the entire experience and I won't be back because of it. I let the service man know exactly what the issue was and led me believe it was a warranty issue when I knew the warranty issue was the PASSENGER not DRIVER seat. More importantly, they said it would take less than an hour and we were there going on three and then to be told it was exactly what I said it was to begin with, given an estimate for thousands for other things and charged $135.00 for something I already knew. Just shady practicing in my opinion, and I'll go elsewhere next time.    So the "Service" manager clown goes on and basically attacks me in his response:  I take our reputation and business practices very seriously and would vigorously investigate anything that would lead our customers to believe we were being anything other than forthright and fair. I took the opportunity to look over the initial write-up, and repair diagnosis. From the information here, as well as your email below,  it appears we were asked to inspect the car for the complaint of; SRS light lit on dash and specifically asked to determine if the repair was a parts warranty from a prior repair to the passenger seat mat as someone else had made that diagnosis and connection.  Our findings were that the vehicle did not need a passenger side seat mat as you were advised, rather a driver's side seat mat, counter to the information you had been given elsewhere, this was a repair that was not covered under an applicable parts warranty. It appears we charged you only for the technicians time to make that determination, as agreed upon , we completed an accurate estimate of that repair as well as other needed services noted during our inspection as a courtesy, you declined those repairs as well as the repair to the SRS system. I am sorry to hear you feel this was "shady". I realize that giving customers information about the condition of their vehicle, especially when it differs from their expectations or promises that other repair shops have made, can be difficult. I am sure you have found in your business model that when reality is different than expectations, the most common response is to attack the credibility of the messenger. If you are interested in making any of the repairs to your vehicle we would certainly still be willing to help.   Garrett O'Dell - Service Manager   What a clown. Nice customer service dummy. You can't tell in this Yelp posting but his verbiage was filled with CAPS and BOLD lettering to show his emphasis in yelling at me. Here's my response:   We already had the correct diagnosis.  I already knew it was the driver's seat mat and should have been told it was not a warranty item in the first place. Further, I was quoted less than an hour, it approached 3 - my business time is billed at $225.00 an hour.   I don't care for your customer service tone either, further exemplifying my feeling of this establishment. I'm not attacking anyone. I'm a BMW customer, and as a lay customer, this is how I felt about my experience at Chapman BMW. Moreover, your customer service approach feels more like an attack to me. So I hope you feel better about yourself, now that you've tried to "prove" me wrong. Enjoy your $135.00 and I'll go somewhere else here on out.   You win Garrett! I'm going to bring my BMW 750Li to North Scottsdale for ALL my needs from here on out.

We've been here a couple of times now and I love the place! We walked in there you feel like you're in a restaurant in Rocky point Mexico. It's got a really cool coastal beach theme. The menu is rather large and has a lot of options. It is a bit cumbersome to understand in parts of the language barrier. Service on both times that we went was exceptional. They have a ceviche tostada on happy hour that is knock your socks off fantastic. That with a cold Corona light draft beer you can't go wrong. My only negative issue was there's a male manager that walks around the dining room on both occasions with a cold and stern look on his face and seems really uninviting. He stopped at our table to clear off some table settings and didn't even speak to us which I thought was disconcerting. I find the parking lot a bit sketchy to as the first time we were there there were people walking out of the restaurant with Bud lights in her hand heading towards her vehicles and the second time there was a couple of good old boys in the parking lot with the tailgates of their trucks down sipping on a bottle of Jack Daniels. Does it give the place very good curb appeal. Other than that this place is rockstar!

Seafood in the desert is always a challenge. Earnie's is not the place to get it. I was excited to see the menu of seafood and try it out and did the other day. The joint is located at what once was a Jilly's location. They haven't changed one thing outside of the signage either. We got sat in a corner booth and I immediately noticed the dirty table. The salt shaker was completely slathered with grease from a prior patron - half filled too.   Sat down and waited for service..and waited...and waited. Christ the place is empty, why such slow service? Literally was a ghost town. No abckground music made sitting there a bit uncomfortable, a TV had sound in the background - what an ambiance killer.    Eventually the manager came over and waited on us the entire time. That said, the service was abysmal.  First two appetizers I ordered they were out of - not a good sign. Asked for a wine list and I quote, "We don't have one. We have a red and a white." After ordering, he never took the menus away and they sat there until end of meal, never cleared app plates, failed to ask for follow up drinks, forgot to deliver 2 ordered food menu items.   The "White Wine" was horrible. We ordered the crab cake sampler and they weren't "cakes" at all but rather three small cake balls - disappointing. Peel and eat shrimp were OK but was served with onions and the onions were so friggin' salty it was crazy. My friend had the fried scallops which was a good portion and he said tasted good. I had soft shell crabs that were not good at all.    Bad ambiance, poor service, meh on the food - a negative trifecta.

What a gem find! Really friendly service off the bat! Teh food was great...I mean REALLY great. What I liked most was that all of the dishes can be made without sugar (I'm diabetic) and also with a heat scale of 1-10...for EVERYTHING on the menu.   We had a Thai Fresh Roll to start with that was really good...and fresh as stated.   I had Thai Sizzling Beef that was a HUGE portion and tasted fantastic. I really loved it.   Thsi wil be added to my regular rotation.

The market rocks. I go here almost every weekend for fresh produce to cook during the week. They are adding more every week. Love the specialty cooking salts. The hummus is great and the pita chips even better. My only knock is whoever runs the facebook page sends WWAAAAYYYYY too many posts. I'm borderline ready to hide them on FB.

Wow! Great food. My wife and I went for lunch today and were very pleased with the meal. The strong but delicate flavor profiles were evident that the chef here know what (s)he is doing.   First off, they deliver a basket of chips with home made dark chips, but wait...there's also fresh plantain chips. It  was delivered with an awesome chili flavored salsa, as well as, a borderline spicy tomatillo sauce. Both tasted great.   I had the beef tacos of lunch. There were 3 on the plate and they are a bit on the diminutive side, but boy they pack a flavor punch. If I recall correctly, the meat was filet mignon and the sauce it was in was out of this world. It was also topped off with a smoked flavor chili pepper mayo and a fresh grilled green onion in the middle. I could eat 10 of those.   My wife had the pork enchiladas. She begrudgingly gave me a single bite to taste as they were so good she didn't want to give em up. And I tasted why as they too were awesome. The stewed pork was very flavorful, and the sauces melded perfectly with flavor  Oh yea! Try the Sangria...it was so spectacular. Served up by the bartender Elitza. Later i watched her make a house margarita all from scratch with fresh juices and wish I had ordered one of those too. She said their margs are all hand crafted with freshly squeezed juices. She also showed us a happy hour menu that was killer and sure to bring us back in...especially for one of those margs at half price.   Two thumbs up for this new joint!!

Had lunch here today and LOVED LOVED LOVED it! Not sure of these negative reviews. They appear to be some haters. The vegetarian commenter guy, well come on dude. You and your boyfriend should call ahead and ask for veggie options. My daughter is veggie and I always do that. Anyhow, the chips with the 2 salsas were dynamite! Wow authentic spices and great flavor. $4 Negro Modelo cam out ice cold. I had the carnitas and they were fantastic! Huge portion too. i cook this often so I appreciated there version. My wife, who is from New Mexico and appreciates NM cuisine had the chicken chimi and said it was very good and PACKED with a ton of meat. Portions hear are huge with the meat! Yea meat! My wife ordered sopapillas with meal as all New Mexicans do and they are great. Only issue I felt the beans needed salt but they were cooked perfectly.   Service was great. Laid back server was cool and very helpful - nice guy. The owners husband (Boyfriend?) was an exceptionally nice guy. Came to our table to explain the menu for over 5 minutes. I love when the service is menu guided to help dwell down to what you like. Thanks for that.   We live rather far from here which stinks but will make a trip out again for that tasty food.

My wife and I loved this place. The service was awesome. Our server was a New Yorker and he really made the experience great. It's just so nice when a server actually knows their product and helps guide you through the ordering process. This guy was great. The food was exceptional too. Antipasto was fresh and exceptional. I had a stuffed chicken dish that was out of this world. I'm hard to please sometimes as I lived for many years in Upstate New York, but they passed my test...We will be back.  We went for a 2nd time last Wed and it was even better this time. Head Waiter Jimmie is incredibly awesome. He reminds me of the Italian waiters from back in NY. Classy-cool! Ask for him.

My wife took the kids to the show and dinner. She said the place was pretty cool and had good offerings. However, two of the six children ate nachos and those two both ended up vomiting later that night. It was definitely pinned on their nachos. The bigger negative was that she called to speak with management, namely to see if others had similar issues, and they never ever returned her phone call. That's rather weak of management to do when trying to establish a new brand. I'm going to go this Friday and check it out for myself...but I won't order any nachos. I'll update after my attendance.

Loved this place. I live really close and was disappointed in myself I hadn't gone yet. My wife and her girlfriends go frequently for the bottle of wine and platter deal they have there. The food is outstanding - fresh ingredients and tasteful. Staff can be a bit wine restaurant snooty but nonetheless they were on top of their game and we never waited (large group of 12). Look forward to going back frequently.

Expected more when visiting this place.  I told the girl I was diabetic and asked for a recommendation and she recommended a Mexican breakfast I can't pronounce (Chilaquiles). I ordered it and it was basically breakfast nachos. Not dietetic for a diabetic...not sure why she recommended that. I tried it anyhow and couldn't eat it as the chips were a soggy mess. Sent it back for corned beef hash with "over easy" eggs...and it was nothing to write home about at all.  What's worse is the grumpy service. When we walked in we stood at the front for 2 minutes before a server walked up and blurted "TWO?" Geez, how about a "Welcome to Over Easy, will there be two of you joining us this morning?"  Female manager did visit the table and was nice. When we were leaving, there were 2 employees at the front and neither batted an eye at us as we left. So...crappy greeting and non-existent parting. This was the first/last impression of this place sandwiched between mediocre food. Too many other great breakfast places that are much friendlier to guests with better food.

We've been to this restaurant three times now and three times we've had an exceptional experience. I absolutely love this place. My vegetarian daughter from several options to choose from as well. Some of the roles are very unique and tasted fantastic. I think the best part is the exceptional service. Each time our server has been outstanding and on one occasion the owner, and Asian female, sat down and talked with us extensively about the restaurant and its offerings. She was super super friendly and we thought she was great. This place goes on our regular rotation!

Super irritated by this place today. They advertised a DieHard Portable Power Pack with a picture that made it appear brand new.No mention in the ad it wasn't the actual picture or any bad condition. I e-mailed ahead of time asking about the item and if it was still available as I wanted to be sure before I drove all that way to get it. Sure it's here was the response. I drive down there and ask the gal at the desk where it is. She leads me to it and I open it up and it's in NO WAY THE CONDITION OF THE PHOTO!!! The handle is all shewed up from a dog, the positive cable had been ripped off and replaced/crimped with a cheap knock off, but worse of it yet. the charger was completely discharged. Such bull crap. Total bait & switch and that type of deception pisses me off. Real lack of integrity here. Worse yet the gal just shrugged it off and walked away from me like she could really care less I just spent a 1/2 hour driving here for their scam advertisement.   To the owner, next time something crappy happens to you and someone/something totally wastes your time, think of me and karma ... jerks.

Top line auto services just that - top-of-the-line. I have had over a dozen services performed here and have been overly satisfied with every single one. Even one time when things I felt weren't fixed properly Chris told me to bring the truck back in and everything was fixed properly, promptly and with no extra charge. I have had everything from oil changes and tuneups, to front and alignments, bodywork and major engine work on my Chrysler 300 C. Chris also works wonders with diesel trucks. I have a Dodge 6.7 L Cummins diesel which many places have difficulty servicing; and I certainly won't go to the Steal-ership for any service issues. Chris and his team have been able to fix or maintain everything properly with my truck. Our Chrysler 300 C Hemi is so dialed in and running so mean and lean I couldn't be happier. Frankly, I was rather surprised to see some of the negative reviews here; however, once you read the negative reviews you can see what kind of wing nuts are writing them. Anyhow, I'm very happy and pleased every time I leave the top line parking lot with one of my vehicles.

Wowzers! This place's food is Rock&Roll in your mouth. Great service and great ambiance. The food is obviously prepared with fresh ingredients and you can tell. The meats they use in their tacos are slow cooked to perfection with love. Small portions on the street tacos and higher then expected price point but satisfied nonetheless.   My only mark down comes from when we requested some cucumber slices instead of chips for the salsa. The cucumbers they delivered had mold on them. They were very apologetic; however, it should have been noticed (appeared the cucumbers came from the bar not the kitchen). Not to take anything away from their chips as they were really good and salsa outstanding.

Really aggravating experience. Really poor communication. Really left me hanging and now I'm really stuck finding someone else on such short notice. Really Angry. Really Frustrated. .

The Perch Brewery ... pffft ... total jerks. I'm totally done with this place and will never go back.   You see, my wife and I, and many many of our friends have been coming to this area for several years and well before the Perch Brewery was open for business. There is this quaint little breakfast and lunch restaurant located in the southwest corner of the property called Yoli's Café. Yoli's is one of our favorite restaurants to go to and as previously mentioned we are regulars and have many friends and family who are also regulars. So for breakfast Yoli's is always a great call especially with the ambience of the common area center patio. Chef Yoli has exceptional food. There is some real love that goes into that cooking and she uses all natural ingredients and the end results is always awesomeness.   We also would frequent the Perch because we love the area's ambiance. The Perch food is mediocre at best. We tried several times and it's always been hit or miss. The last time I ordered a medium rare burger it was cooked grey well-done. Gross. Service is also a bit lackluster and never consistent which I hate. However, I always came back as I like the beer selections. No more though ... ever. Jerks.   You see, The Perch Brewery in their greedy wisdom decided that it was okay to be total a-holes to their neighbors at Yoli's Café. They felt it was a good idea to weld a big-ol metal fence barring any type of access to the common area in/out from Yoli's Café. So the other day when we arrived and entered the area from the east-side parking, there is absolutely no access into Yoli's whatsoever anymore. It took several minutes before we could figure out even how to get into Yoli's. This metal fence is just obtuse and ugly. Soon after we were seated another group of people came in for breakfast and one of them said to the server, "what's with the ugly metal barrier out there? It was a real journey just to try to get in here! Are they trying to put you out of business or what?" Those are my mirrored feelings exactly.  It's your business decision as the Perch Brewery to act in this unfriendly and greedy manner if you choose; however, just realize that your actions cause customer reactions and our reaction to your neighborly unfriendliness is to never ever spend another dime at the Perch Brewery again. Instead I will just go down the street to SanTan brewery for my draft beer cravings, and bring everyone else with me.  Oh, and moreover, the lame excuse that we were given from the server about it being due to liquor law is a bunch of friggin' hooey. Have some integrity to be truthful.  I'm very very well-versed in Title IV and that's just a crock. You could have put signs up that said "no alcohol beyond this point." And if you still wanted your ugly metal barrier fence up to separate the two businesses you easily could've been a friendly neighbor and had a gate installed for access into your neighbor's business as an easement for her customers, and again with a sign that says "no alcohol beyond this point." So shove that lame excuse up your Perch.  We'll continue to spend money at Yoli's but never ever again at The Perch Brewery. You people are total jerks and messing with others livelihood is super uncool and karma will teach you a lesson on that soon enough. Just remember that when it starts to happen to your business.

I am a tiki aficionado and was looking forward to checking this place out. The curb appeal is rather cool outside. Entering the place it does have a real modern feel hence the word in their name. However, I was really really disappointed that there wasn't any tiki type props or decorations anywhere in the restaurant other than the kitschy midcentury props stored inside the bar and the lonely only picture in the entire tiki themed restaurant hidden in the corner - a Mark Ryden print. I just expected a lot more and was told by the bartender that the other central location is better themed so I hope that they're going to make some additions as far as the decor goes . Now we had just eaten at Malee's Thai Room so we didn't sample any of the food items. What we did have was this giant scorpion bowl drink that was strong as heck and tasted awesome - flaming nectar of the gods it was. Bravo! Mr. Bartender. We would have stayed just a little bit longer but there was an extremely intoxicated noisy loud platinum blonde Snottsdale bimbo screeching stupidity right next to my wife's ear so we decided to pack it up after one. I'll make my way down here again and check it out again and maybe downtown too.
