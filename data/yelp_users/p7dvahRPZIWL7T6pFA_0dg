The Thai Food I tried was unique and different than from other Thai Places I've been too including the sister restaurant The Little Thaiger.   We sat on the comfortable covered patio.  I tried the crispy spicy Corn Fritters. They were a little sweet, a little spicy and seemed very light in texture almost like eating a rice cake. The cucumber chutney was light and refreshing and went well with the corn fritters. I thought the fritters were very unique and never had anything like them before.  I enjoyed the 24K, it was really delicious Thai Pumpkin, Two kinds of eggplant including Thai, fresh green beans in spicy green curry. I added chicken to the dish and it was prepared well. I thought this dish was delicious but would have been much better if they just added a little fresh basil.   My husband really enjoyed the Sliced WILD BOAR in HOT red chili sauce.   Service was very good. We had two servers that both checked on us several times and also offered refills before we even needed them.  Tasty food but I would ask for some fresh basil next time.  3.75 stars

I have been here twice and last time was great but this time I had expensive first row balcony seats. I didn't know they weren't the same as the other seats. THESE SEATS ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE !!!! They are much smaller and much less leg room than middle row plane seats and the person next to me was a triple large person and spilled into my seat and my husband who is normal size spilled into my other side so I think I only had 10 inches of room and was almost not able to squeeze my feet in . At intermission we jumped into the row behind us and felt very relieved they were NORMAL seats . Many elderly people attend and they drop balls of Kleenex everywhere I can't tell you how many balls of Kleenex I stepped on. The ladies bathroom  is pretty and clean but was designed terrible. You only have maybe one foot of room between the door and toilet AND THE DOOR OPENS IN so you have to hop over the toilet to get out. If you are an X-size don't even try it.  Next time I will call to ask if the seats are the regular ones or the mini ones. I only noticed this problem in the first row balcony.

If you like FRESH seafood and also enjoy spending very little such as $25 for TWO DINNERS this might be a place for you!   Small converted older Phoenix Ranch style house converted into a cheerful Seafood Restaurant that had live music when we were there, located among a row of row of other Mexican Restaurants. (that were rougher looking)  We had the spicy marinated fish and the diablo shrimp.  The Marinated Fish had essence of vegetable threw it and was cooked to perfection being very light moist but not falling apart also skinless , lacking fish taste meaning being sweet and fresh instead . The fish was topped with a spicy red sauce that was a perfect spice heat and topped with fancy cut lightly cooked celery for texture . This dish came with salad garnish , beans , rice , tortillas and the fish was elevated up on the plate by the use of fries .  The diablo shrimp come with a similar set up but are topped with onions and the spice heat is more of a challenging 10 out of 10 instead of the expected heat of 7ish . (this dish had good flavor but is not for everyone)  at the time of this review this is a cash only establishment but a sign is posted that they will except credit cards soon .  We were Five Stars satisfied with meals and service , we'd return .

The exterior of the building might be unappealing but once you step in it's whimsical and cheerful. This is a Family Owned Sinaloan Style Seafood Restaurant that is open every day for lunch and dinner.  Right away they gave us house made chips , the daily made green guacamole style salsa and the spicier red salsa. They are delicious and differ from other salsas I've tried elsewhere and I only tried a few and then they presented Mini Complementary Tostada Ceviches and gosh they were excellent and were better in taste (not quality of fish)  than some I've tried at high end dinning destinations paying maybe the same as my whole meal here and these were FREE here.   I always enjoy the fish veracruzana with vegetables but this time tried the fish with poblano peppers , onions and tomatoes. Both these dishes I can tell you are as tasty as can be. The fish filet is mild and fresh with a feather light batter that is not oily being the lightest batter I have ever seen on a delicate fresh fish. For me what makes these dishes so great is the delicious well made light sauces they are in. Also included are very soft fresh tasting tortillas and on the platter was salad , refried beans and a white rice with mixed vegetables that is yummy from the sauce of your dish. All this food I got was only $13.00 It was not good but very good.  While we were dining I noticed most people were ordering what looked like a steaming large cauldron of mixed grilled meats and fish , I found out this dish is called Malcajete and it looked great to try.  They offer many variations of fish , steamed , grilled , battered, and breaded with a variety of sauces. Very little in the way of chicken or beef but they do have some.  It's a small family run business so when they get busy sometimes they go down a bit I noticed on a visit after I wrote this Yelp.  3.5-5 stars

Very Good Family owned Sinaloan Style Mexican SEAFOOD Restaurant that's open everyday for lunch and dinner. Prices are reasonable I'd say the average plate price runs about $13.00. Most of the menu is seafood so plan on having seafood if you come here.   I've been here several times over the years and I'd say most of the time but not always they start you off with a complimentary mini fish tostada that delicious with your chips and salsas.  I can vouch for the Fish Veracruzana and the Fish Poblano plates because I had them before and the fish was light ,fresh tasting and flaky. The sauce and toppings  is really what made these dishes good to me. They come with your usual rice and beans and tortillas. They have many choices in this kind of dish.  Last time I was here the place was packed and we were the only table in the place that didn't order the Molcajete so I wanted to order it this time.  The Molcajete is a boiling hot caldron filled with your choice of Diablo Hot Chipotle sauce or Tomatillo Sauce. The menu that we had reads Fish, Shrimp, and Beef. But what we received was Battered Fish, Shrimp, Beef, Chicken and Octopus. The Diablo sauce is very hot and spicy but also very tasty and I found myself adding it everything I ate. Over all I thought it was good and fun to share. It cost $22.00 and feeds at least two people. It also comes with rice , beans and tortillas. If you get the Molcajete you should eat the shrimp first because they get over cooked just sitting on the hot Molcajete as ours did. I'm not a beef person but I thought the beef came out prepared the best in this dish.  I do note you should view the photo of the building so you know what the outside looks like before you give this place a try.

They have updated the menu to one menu that starts with Chinese foods and ends with Americanized Chinese.  For the most unique TONGUE Thrilling Numbing and Spicy food this is it! Honest to God the Hot Pot is a FULL SIZE COOKING POT filled with chopped up chicken on the bone with skin  (if you order chicken) vegetables such as bean sprouts cabbage , hot broth herbs , oil  and spices and lots of those Szechwan Peppercorns that have an illegal drug like effect that makes you crave it. This dish was not like anything we've had anywhere else. I do understand that hot pots are more elaborate at places that specialize with them but you do the the hot pot taste just not the whole experience.  Service was better this time but still not professional, the staff was laughing at my husband eating the hot pot with the fork they gave him. (we were not given chop sticks) He forked out the chicken pieces and vegetables and ate them on the plate. I guess most people just put the whole piece of chicken in mouth and use the plate to spit out the bones.  I had the water boiled fish that I tried to order last time, it was very good and lighter than the water boiled chicken I was given last time, both those dishes seemed very mild and far less tongue Thrilling compared to the Chicken hot pot but they were also flavorful and were lightly tongue thrilling.   This place is still a GEM of Phoenix and is an extraordinary dining experience if you dare to order something of the Chinese part of menu.

If you order from the Chinese Menu and not the American Chinese Menu items your food might be TONGUE Thrilling Spicy and your mouth might get numb.  We got started with the Sauteed Spicy Cucumbers. They were so crispy spicy and refreshing and were a nice start. I had the water boiled chicken and it WAS THE SPICIEST FOOD I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. It was SO SPICY I felt High and my head was flooded with Euphoria. My mouth went numb. I had this dish twice here before once with chicken and once with fish and neither time before was it this kind of spicy. It really was too spicy for me this time so I took home my leftovers and will thin it down for latter. The chicken in this dish was tender like no other place makes chicken. This really was an experience.  Our waiter highly recommended the hot spicy beef with pickled vegetables. The beef was very good and very tender like the chicken was and it also was a spicy dish but at a more comfortable level.  Portions were large and generous.  Service was pleasant (this time) but you only drink water unless you order a beer.  They don't clear your plates when you are done either.  It's an experience!

I Tried the New Dinners   Who knew the Crespelle was light as air garbanzo bean crepes filled with the lightest ricotta and spinach topped with a what seemed like slow roasted pealed tomato sauce and basil with a just the right size piece of focaccia studded with tiny tomatoes and olives . ($12.)   My companion had the Schreiners Sausage with polenta beluga lentils , greens and the same focaccia and we received the hand made chocolate with our meals . ($10)   The service was very friendly by the Girl at register and the Chef . The cashier ran our dinners out to us .   The only other items on menu the night we went were meatballs , vegetables and lemoncello sorbet .   From what I understand the menu might change every night and they plan to expand next door so more changes will be happening .   I have also been here for lunch many times and for lunch I still would rate the same .   They now are selling Bianco Mozzarella Cheese and Bianco Tomatoes maybe you can make a masterpiece at home .

I tried the Rosa HERE! and it was better than the Rosa I had at Pizzeria Bianco. The pistachios were baked on and not just tossed on at the end so the flavor developed. The Rosa HERE had Rosemary on it that you could see and taste and the crust was far less black , it was charred but not black .   The Escarole salad we ordered with it was very good.  It's take out but you can eat out side at one of the tables and it wasn't busy at all.  The menu last night was, a few salads, 4 pizzas, 2 pastas and Italian ice.  I don't know if they started milling their own flour yet from heirloom Arizona grains yet but I find that interesting.

Everything is always good here but the NUTMEG ITALIAN ICE is MIND BLOWING CRAZY GOOD! If that stuff was sold in Tubs at the supermarket bunches would be sold. The texture was like slightly compacted snow that seemed light as air. The flavor was not too sweet but perfect with an unexpected something refreshing about it.   This place is different from the other Bianco restaurants and is my favorite. Everything is always good and this place really has soul. It so far has always been good for lunch and the few times I've been here for dinner and my last pizza was better here than from the pizzeria.  I always just sat out at the outside tables but this time we decided to try out the dining room. My husband had the sopressata sandwich and it was great the way it always is. I had the tuna salad and it seemed better than usual maybe because it was served on a real plate instead of the plastic container. We shared the focaccia it was very good it was a cheddar , red onion , and tomato focaccia.   4.5 stars

We've been coming here for years and it's not new news but over the last year the menu here has changed. For Years I used to order the tuna salad because the sandwiches are too filling for me for lunch and it's gone now so I tried the chicken salad. The chicken salad was made with white meat chicken that was cooked well and was still was moist and tossed with a whole grain mustard lots of  apple and seemed sweetened with something. The greens underneath were very fresh and were garnished with a fresh ripe local tomato and it came with a piece of country bread. The salad was good and an above average salad but it was sweet.  My husband always used to enjoy the sopressata sandwich and that one has also been updated to be made with roasted onions instead of the fire roasted red pepper. It's still a good sandwich but it used to be great with the red pepper mostly because of the natural juices the pepper added to the sandwich improved the flavor and the meaty texture of the pepper that made it easier to eat. The onions are good but not the same but it was nice that it came with a small side of apple slaw.   They also don't give out the candies anymore with your meal.  The bread is special from here as it's made with local heirloom grains.

Christo's is OK if your into three courses in less than 45 minutes. I was expecting to dine here but it was much more similar to a diner experience were you get whammed bammed and thank you'd as we were in and out in a jiffy.  My husband loves classic Italian Foods and according to reviews Christo's seemed like a top destination. Honestly in general the food was OK but not great and nothing I'd drive out of my way for. I almost never consider service as part of my review since it varies all the time everywhere but in this case it sort of even lessened the experience so MUCH that I have to consider it otherwise I would have given Christo's three stars.  Our waiter quickly greats us and ask if we want the menu or the restaurant week special. Despite being around 70 years old he was very quick talking and very speedy and sort of made us nervous but what really bothered me the most was him  and his helpers standing there not to far from us with his arms crossed just watching us like a hawk eating the whole time.   Now the food.  I started with a Christo's Caesar Salad. I could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons. The dressing wasn't properly emulsified nor was it balanced in flavors and was super heavy with lemon. The croutons were crisp and buttery. I pointed out the faults since I know them but it really was an OK salad. I do note I wasn't offered fresh ground pepper, nicer restaurants do offer fresh ground pepper for Caesar Salads.  I was sort of excited to have the classic dish Sole Meuniere here. The Christo's Version is nontraditional as the fish seemed heavily coated (maybe battered not sure) with flour in a lemon white wine sauce in stead of a traditional lightly floured and prepared in browned butter. The fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it.   Desserts seemed house made and were OK. We both liked the lemon cake better over the mousse.  A glass of house wine was included with our dinners and during the meal we finished it and my husband ordered another round. He noticed a price difference from the menu and questioned our server. The server confirmed it wasn't the same price as the menu and said that for restaurant week they up charge the wine. It was only a few dollars but I feel this is bad business and not good for customer relations.  I was really torn between two and three stars but the surprise of the wine up charge, being really rushed though dinner and with the waiter and his help all standing across from us just watching us the whole time in a unprofessional way sort of spoiled the dining experience.  2.5 Stars

After you watch the movie "Deli Man" you will have a new appreciation and an unbelievable hunger for Deli Food.  The last 4 delis i've been to didn't make the cut for pastrami & fish.  Scott's decor is a little old and tired but the restaurant earned a current grade "A" Maricopa Health Inspection.  When I looked at the menu I saw many items I haven't seen on other deli menus including a very large selection of smoked fish.  I ordered the smoked fish supreme platter. I got fresh hand carved Nova Scotia, White Fish and Lake Sturgeon that came with many sides and a bagel. They do have belly lox on the menu but were out of it. The hand carved Nova was very good and maybe the best you can find anywhere. The white fish was outstanding. You can't find better anywhere. I thought the sturgeon was good but I don't have much exsperience eating sturgeon because it's normally about $70.00 a pound so I haven't eaten that much. The potato salad and the cole slaw had good flavors but were a little drippy. The pickle was really great and above average. The everything bagel was really different but good. It was almost like a very oniony onion bagel with also with the everything toppings and was really packed with flavor. My platter was very large and I took enough home for another meal.  My husband ordered a triple decker sandwich with turkey pastrami and corned beef. The turkey tasted like fresh roasted. The corned beef was good. The pastrami taste very similar to what regular pastrami taste like back east. It had the right amount of fat and the correct flavors. The sandwich platter came with a mountain of crispy fries that might have been fresh cut red potatoes with several tasty pickles and fresh coleslaw.  After I watched the movie "Deli Man" I learned that Deli's have the highest food cost of all restaurants because they sell mostly meat so it isn't the cheapest food because it can't be.  But really the thing that struck me the most was that there are no more immigrants that bring over the recipes.   From what I tried already Scott's Food is very Good and I don't feel the need to look for another deli.  See the "Deli Man" Movie and support a Deli!

They have won the 2011 award from Wine Spectator for excellence and besides the wine list offer several different wine flights that go from starter wines to rich chewy long lasting in four generous portions that adds to the enjoyment of dinning.  The appetizer special was prosciutto wrapped white asparagus ( grilled ) , buffalo mozzarella , heirloom tomatoes topped with an over easy quail egg that was topped with a shave of black truffle surrounded by truffle vinaigrette. This was pretty much as good as it gets. I saw black specs in the vinaigrette and thought they were pepper but to my surprise they were pieces of black truffle so I was impressed that the chef didn't use cheap truffle oil and used real truffles. The buffalo cheese has so much more going on with it than regular mozzarella and also just melts in your mouth in a pleasurable way. The prosciutto used was high end. I also liked that Chef Stephen Toevs came out and asked us how we liked it.  I ordered the special, sole topped with fennel salad surrounded by grain mustard beurre blanc and whipped not spicy jalapeño potatoes. I wasn't sure if these taste would work together but they did and were an incredible experience.  My husband had the prime strip steak au poivre. This steak was as good as strip steak can be but it came with fries and onion straws. The the fries and onion straws were good but not as exciting as the very good prime meat and are part of the reason this wasn't a five star review. I do note the sides of fries and onions were included in the modest price for this kind of steak. (Prime strip steak runs approx $49.00 lb at AJs)  We have been up to this point been receiving the very best over the top service from our waiter Grant ( who really was a joy ). But at this point the two waiters on got slammed and I counted our waiter running around with at least seven tables  ( some were outside on the patio ) He had help but wasn't able to ask us how are meals were ( although they were great )   We wanted to order dessert since the meals were very good and Grant did make the trip to clear our plates and give dessert menus. We don't drink coffee but I do think we should have been asked if we wanted some with the hazelnut bar we ordered but I know that was due to the workload our waiter was experiencing . I'm not being mean or picky but in high end dining you are paying for everything great.  Over all the food is reasonably priced for high end. The specials were OUTSTANDING. I think the menu is slightly dated and the dessert we tried was good but is not on the level of the really great meals. I also used my preferred dining card and received one meal for free.  I would love to try more of Chef Toevs specials. I got the impression he is a masterful and Creative Chef.

I suddenly knew this was a mistake as soon as we started to scale the steep difficult steps and the handrail covered with a large amount of bird POOP. My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.  We were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.  We thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.  I can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.  We asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.  Our waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.  The starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.  The middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.  For dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.  I can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.  1.5 stars almost 2 stars but with price factored in I feel one star  SLIGHT UPDATE 9-11-13 I read that they got a new chef since my review so hopefully they are better now.

It is easy for me to overlook the dated decor that reminds me of old steak houses the service was so exceptional and the food was dependable to up to masterful . Our knowledgeable waiter explained most of the menu and gave detail to where meats were sourced from .  We started with the corn ravioli's with truffle oil , the flavors went together well and it was a nice size portion for two to start with.  We both thought the salad of radicchio , endive , walnuts , pears , and gorgonzola was a perfect balance of taste and texture in a generous portion for two to share .  My husband had the wild boar loin that came with a very rich sauce to balance the extremely  lean meat . He said the sauce was a little spicy , beefy rich and well made the flavors went nicely with the addition of mushrooms . The wild boar plate also came with buttery mashed potatoes and buttery fresh vegetables .  I had the Scottish Salmon that was seared on the top but prepared almost medium well . The Salmon came with a red pepper lightly creamed sauce and  haricot verts , asparagus , sugar snap peas and eggplant . The vegetables were all cooked perfect and were buttery . Chopped raw tomatoes on top cut the richness .  We shared huckleberry tart for dessert it had pastry cream and less huckleberries than I was expecting but it was good , soon we were ready for the check but they bring us out these tiny BAKED chocolate mousse that tasted light as chocolate air .  A sweet ending! (also no problems using a Groupon here)

BEST VALUE DINING IN PHOENIX  We always go for the 3 (like 4) course menu ($22) and shared  Cesar salad that was big crisp ,fresh with house made croutons followed by butternut ( 3 bigger sized ) squash raviolis ( so tasty piping hot in tasty flavorful sauce)   I had a combo platter of sole , arctic char , vegetables and seasoned rice. Everything on my plate was absolutely delicious , both fish were so fresh and cooked so perfect , the assortment of vegetables were hot and crisp . This dish came with rice and it was one of the best rice dishes I have ever had out !  My husband had the filet mignon cooked to a perfect medium rare with a peppercorn sauce , fresh vegetables and  potatoes au gratin .   We still had room for the dessert that was soon to come since the dinner proteins ARE VERY SMALL  (I DO note VERY SMALL ) but it is small done right , with vegetables and a starch side .  A waiter surprised us with THREE  mini desserts cheesecake , strawberry cobbler and the yummiest lemon tart with a mini scoop of raspberry sorbet. ( he just gave us an extra I think )  Easy on your wallet and also your stomach . It was so nice the perfect portions , you could eat a lot without feeling like you ate too much .   Wine is priced reasonable. Service has always been very good .

This time I was unsure between four and five stars but it was close so I went with five because most times everything is usually nailed.   It is very hard to pass on the Prix Fixe $25.00 three course menu and both of us went with it again. It's kind of fun to get the whole caboodle for only $25.00 and so what if it isn't a hipster crowd that dines here as we were the only non Senior Citizens here who cares!  They start you off with warm fresh buttery flakey miniature croissants.  We shared a nicely presented Beet and goat cheese napoleon that was garnished with walnuts.  Next we shared very earthy mini mushroom raviolis garnished with fresh tarragon.  I went with the beef tenderloin with green peppercorn sauce. The beef was tasty and tender but petite (my guess is two oz.) the sauce was rich with butter and brandy but did lack a pepper taste and salt but was very tasty as is. The vegetables were hot fresh and crisp. The labor intensive potatoes dauphinoise were creamy and garlicky and maybe a little heavy handed with the garlic this time but still good.  My husband went with the lobster and he said it was cooked perfect.  They called my dessert a raspberry pots de cream, it was a rich custard studded with raspberries and did have a thin layer of caramelized sugar. The chocolate mousse was rich with chocolate.  This place isn't for everyone because of the petite proteins gives you that is a French Style of eating feel. But in my opinion it is petite done right. You don't need a lot along with everything else and the rich sauces.   This place is a Winner!

The Prix Fixe $25.00 Three Course Menu is so darn desirable it's hard to order  something else but I went with the specials and it was only $19.00 for THREE GREAT COURSES!  They start everybody off with these indulgent mini warm flakey buttery croissants.  One of the soups of the evening was called Chilled Heirloom Tomato Soup. It consisted of not one NOT TWO but THREE small dishes of different high end Heirloom tomatoes Red, Yellow and Orange.  Each soup was chilled and each soup was very velvety but each one was seasoned in a different way. That was certainly a BIG WOW for only $6.00.  My husband ordered off the menu and had the Three Cheese Tartine. It's like a French open Faced Garlic Bread with Melted Cheeses and Pesto. They were very yummy and the plate came with a generous fresh mixed green salad. ($9.50)  I had the Rainbow Trout special ($13.00). The moist fresh tasting trout came topped with rich beurre blanc sauce sprinkled with fresh basil and chives. The portion of fish was small I am guessing about three ounces but was enough with everything. I picked the fresh mixed greens as my side dish but the other choices were potatoes or rice.   My husband had the Duck Confit that came with bacon laced lentils ($16.00 the highest price menu item) He said it was the BEST DUCK he ever had and other places were we paid twice as much or more haven't made duck as delicious,  moist, flavorful and with a crispy perfect skin to boot too!  We didn't order dessert but our waiter presented us with Slices of Blueberry Mousse rolls. A rolled moist not too sweet yellow cake with perfect blueberry mousse. It was just a wonderful ending.  Two really GREAT three course meals for  only $44.50 before tax, tip and beverages.  I've been here a bunch of times. The food is ALWAYS VERY GOOD and the same can be said for the service.

Why would anybody wait for Restaurant Week when Vincent Market Bistro is priced better than Restaurant Week every day!  Vincent Market Bistro is a Comfortable Casual French Style Bistro that offers exceptional service and delicious French Style Food with South West Style accents. It doesn't matter if you order off the $25. Prix Fixe 3 Course Menu or the A La Carte Menu your not going to spend much either way. Everyone here drinks wine you either order a glass or two or a bottle. The other thing to keep in mind is that there is no late night here I think they stop serving around 8pm.  I've been here a bunch of times and all the food is always fantastic! They always start you off with Buttery Fresh Croissants on super adorable plates. I particularly enjoy steak here more than anyplace else because it's always delicious and not too big of a portion. I also always enjoy the fresh seafoods they offer that usually come with a Basil Beurre Blanc Sauce. My husband thinks the Duck Confit and the lamb are better and more enjoyable here than most others he has tried. No matter what you order it will be delicious with fresh herbs and properly prepared.   The desserts are always delicious and are worth the calories.  The Service here is always very professional and warm.  I always enjoy every dinner from Vincent Market Bistro.  As a slight update 6-1-15 the Prix 3 course is now $29.00 and is still terrific!

No reason NOT to give FIVE stars.  Excellent atmosphere,service and most important excellent food.  We shared the antipasto platter that included house cured meats, house made cheeses,humus and pickled vegetables (one was brussels sprouts)   I had Scottish Salmon that came with crispy onions, asparagus, and a cheese supreme lemon tomato tart. Everything was seasoned and prepared perfect. The tart was so unique and unusual, it looked like a slice of pizza and I was tempted to pick it up with my hands to eat.   My dish was great but my husbands dish might be the dish T Cooks is most proud of, it was the Paella. Some of the ingredients that were in the Paella were cockles, calamari, pork belly, chicken, perfect prepared shrimp , sausage and mussels. Not only a delicious dish but also over generous in size to be enjoyed again.  The inside out ice-cream sandwich tasted almost like a gourmet milky way bar it had those flavors but it was made of chocolate sponge cake and frozen milk chocolate mousse.  I did not have a problem with them adding a 18% gratuity to our bill for two people since I usually tip 20% and added on the rest. I am not sure if they normally do this or only since I was using my preferred restaurant card that gives me one meal for free.  I liked the Menu that they had it seemed that they offered something for everyone including vegetarians and vegans.  Our waiter was very professional, knowledgeable and welcoming.   Great for Special occasions or High End Dining!

La Fontanella is NOT your average Italian Restaurant the food is better. Much of the menu is Tuscan or Sicilian with many house made pastas, Dishes and are seasoned surprising well with many being braised or roasted and service is very professional in a crisp very clean dining rooms that look almost like someones home. The foods we tried so far have been resort quality at nearly strip mall prices.  We were impressed with our last visit here so we made our second visit.  We started with the upgraded fresh salad's are upgraded when you add Gorgonzola and walnuts ($2) they were extremely crisp and piled high on the plate so high that salad spilled off the plate as you ate it. The bread they give you is good and you are given their signature herb ed olive oil.  I had the special Chilean Sea Bass with spaghetti and both were cooked to perfection. The Fish was so perfect and light and the spaghetti was also a perfect al dente. This dish was set in a VERY WELL thought out stock that was perfect ,not salty, not oily, not buttery but laced with perfect flavors. Fresh chopped tomatoes and onion topped this dish.  My husband had the Ossobuco (Veal Shank) that was served with a fresh rice blend.   We were too full to have the really great house made gelato but had it last time. Desserts are all house made.  They put out a coupon about every other week for an approx $45.00 dinner for two special that includes a bottle of wine (that is a cash only special) You should clip out the coupon from the Thursday AZ Republic even if you want other dishes they are somewhat flexible with the coupon and you can save a large amount of money.  I have told people I know about this place after our first visit and it is a favorite dining destination of theirs and they go back again and again also with friends.  As a slight update,on a return visit I had the chicken pollard and honestly would not have given 4 stars for this meal since it only is chicken with a dusting of dry sun dried tomatoes a few caper and a sliced olive around the plate. My dinner didn't come with a side or vegetable and left me underwhelmed. I will leave the rating at 4 stars since the other times I've been here it was 4 stars good and I would return but I'd never try the chicken pollard again.

This may not be exquisite five star dining but it is nothing less than four star Jalisco Mexican dining,this is not average it is very good and the owners Maria and her husband are super nice and charming.  On our last visit before several, my husband enjoyed Albondigas Soup, it had two large meatballs a large potato, a large zucchini in a tasty rich chicken broth. (3.95)  The Jalisco meals are what many people enjoy coming here for that you can't get at the usual Mexi places. We have been here several times and mostly pick Mexican Meals we can't get elsewhere.  He had the Birria plate this time and it was falling apart tender tasty beef with rice and beans served with a plate of cut radishes, onions and cilantro and choice of tortillas. (9.99)  I had Carne De Res Con Chile Rojo (beef in red sauce) my beef was tender and also came with rice , beans and choice of tortillas. (9.99)  Both meals were great and fresh, the carne de res con chile rojo was more of a building spice dish, and I would rate it at 6 out of 10 on the spice scale but slightly building and interesting.  I spoke to Maria Saturday and SHE TOLD ME NEXT WEEK, they ARE moving to new location at 7 and Thunderbird next week and she showed me the picture of the store front and it reads El Conquistador

This Hilton is going threw a renovation. I got to stay in a newly remodeled room. I liked how fresh and modern it was. Our stay was good but not perfect. The bed was comfortable and our room seemed clean. You have a small slim shower and you have to turn the facet counter clock wise for your water. The other thing is that it's hard to get an outlet by your bed incase you need one for something. During our stay NONE of the vending machines had bottled water to purchase and my husband complained at the front desk and then they gave us bottles of water. Had the free breakfast the next day and it was OK. The ride back from the airport was OK. Overall I had a good stay.

Where else can you go and get Wild Boar and Venison Sausages or Buffalo Meatloaf?  Name me just one place where you can get Walleyed Pike.  If you choose to dine here you will be eating at ARIZONA'S ORIGINAL STEAKHOUSE est 1947 but restored and added to City of Phoenix Historical Register for roles in AZ Cattle industry and Architectural style.  Something struck me as different when we entered here we were greeted by a host that greeted us like VIPS and seemed genuine not rushed although other people were coming in. You see the extra care that went into your setting everything is polished till it sparkles. Wait staff is dressed professional and are knowledgeable.  We were started off with complimentary fresh cut vegetables and dip on a very shiny well polished relish tray and piping hot  biscuit's bread muffins that were rich sweet and moist  and soon we received salads (house salad or soup is included) the salad was large and fresh but very mildly seasoned.  My husband had the Wild West Mixed Grill of Elk Medallion, Walleyed Pike, Wild Boar and Venison Sausage that included potato cake ,rice pilaf and vegetables. Everything was prepared well and seasoned mildly.   I had the Walleyed Pike it was lightly pecan dusted and buttered this fish is very mild and rich textured and was also served with fresh vegetables and rice pilaf.  Both meals were large enough to feed two people for us a few things were less than 4 stars but that is due to just not being our style nothing was wrong with anything.  I was impressed with the hospital cleanliest of the Ladies room.  The Stockyards is Dining it is not just going out to eat

Organ Stop Pizza is an ATTRACTION that sells food. The food isn't the best just like from any other attraction but I do note they are very clean and post a Grade "A" Health Inspection Sign.  That said this is a very casual large family friendly place where you order at the counter, pay, get your drinks and silverware, seat yourself and look to a giant board on the wall for your number and pick up your food yourself.   The attraction is seeing and hearing one of the largest Wurlitzer Organs in the world. Not all but many of the songs played are theme songs. I heard the Star Wars Theme Song followed by the Star Trek Theme Song. I heard American Theme Songs and lots of Disney Theme Songs. Beware lots of young children all around dancing to the music between tables. Lots of family gatherings with birthday parties too.  Downstairs they have setting for about 500 people in bench style tables. It is very loud downstairs but you are closer to the organ can see more of the organ around the room.  Upstairs is smaller and seats around 200 people with tables. Upstairs might be the romantic spot because you are near the woofers and the seats vibrate a lot when the Titanic Theme Song is played.  The salad bar is similar to what budget steak houses offer but the difference is that everything was fresh.  The pizza is similar to a frozen pizza but slightly better. The crust is thin and crispy covered in corn meal or semolina and the cheese is better than from a frozen pizza.  Nobody waits on you but they do have bus people to clear the plates and clean.  For those that get board of the organ playing people can spend time in the arcade or shop for stuffed animals and organ playing music at the gift shop.  Parking is easy in the very large parking lot.  This place was fun and should be on everyone's bucket list!

I note this is the rating for a Monday-Friday visit. I do understand the weekends are better with gun shows.  I wanted to come here after seeing this place on Laura McKenzie's Travel Show. I really wanted the see the MYSTERY SHACK that defies gravity with water running the wrong way and gravity that makes you walk on a diagonal.   My main reason for the two star rating is because the website states the mystery shack is open 10-5 and it clearly wasn't. We also saw to call for seasonal hours and when we called the number it just rang and rang with nobody to answer. I think the charge to enter the mystery shack would have been  $5.00 a person if it was open.  The reptile house was also closed.  The Ice Cream and Salsa House were also closed.  I saw the museum ($1.00) it was very dusty and had an old Robert Redford's Buffalo Coat from a Movie he was in.  It doesn't take long to walk the grounds.  It's free to enter.  They have a Church on the grounds were you can pray.  I wouldn't say don't go here but I recommend to wait for the weekend so maybe everything might be open and you might see the gun shows.

Kai Restaurant is a Forbes Travel Guide five star and a five diamond AAA restaurant located in Chandler Arizona.   Kai specializes in cuisine that is Native American tribal inspired sourcing as much regional ingredients as possible. The menu changes with the seasons and this season the menu features many different proteins such as elk, buffalo, pork, lamb and more.   I found that the service was attentive and impeccable. Besides enjoying a shop stopping dinner this event also was slightly educational from the interpretations of menu paintings described by our server.  Dinner takes about three hours without the multi course tastings. Several amuse bouche are served and tribal flute music plays in the background.  I do note although they say they can accommodate anyone. I am not certain that they actually offer any vegetarian plates. Possibly only one of the salads might be vegetarian style but the other as I was surprised to find out after it was sitting in front of me that it  had squid in it. Ironically the salad was named, "From The Garden" I sure wasn't expecting squid and my server offered to make me a new one or get something else. I don't feel it's necessary to remove a star for this one fault since the salad was so absolutely stunning.   I received the most sophisticated breath taking salad I've ever seen before that truly looked as if it was growing up from a garden with fancy vegetables I've never seen before like a small green with a fuzzy bright red top that I was told was some sort of spinach. The salad was delightful and looked magical. I was told it was a small plate and it was much larger than I expected it to be.   For dinner I had the Chimayo Rubbed Dry Aged New York Stirp that came with horseradish potatoes gratin, creamed spinach, heirloom carrots with bordelaise sauce. The steak wasn't the most succulent steak I've ever had but it did have a really great crust on it that was very unique. The portion was very large for me and after eating enough I took home close to 7 ounces of steak. Heirlooms carrots were scented with vanilla or something that reminded me of vanilla. I thought the creamed spinach was very good but the potatoes gratin was slightly over salted.   My husbands Elk Loin wrapped in Iberico seemed like a much more complex dinner and I went green with envy when they shaved fresh truffles over it.  Peanut butter in  mousse towers, peanut sponge cakes, crunchy peanut brittle dust and Jelly Dessert was many layers of peanut taste and very grown up jelly. Blackberry five spice sorbet, poached grapes and red wine hibiscus drops adorned the plate. This dessert really was amazing. It wasn't too sweet and was just right and had many different textures and was delicious.  Waiting for us in the car was a handwritten Thank You Card from the server, two bottles of water and a box of chocolates.  If you attended Devoured this year you might have picked up a card from Kai that would give each guest a complimentary glass of wine and a complimentary appetizer. For two people that adds up to a $70. savings. If you still have your card now is the time to try Kai if you were thinking of doing so.

I met the owner briefly and she did a lot of research into developing what kind of Delicatessen she wanted to open. The service is casual, you order at the counter and the food get delivered to you. This place looks like a deli. Big Deli case and little not so fancy tables and plenty of tables outside facing the parking lot.  This Delicatessen is Chicago Style with some traditional Jewish items. I've never been to Chicago but I met a friend from Chicago and she said this place serves food just like what she had in Chicago.  I tried a Nova Lox and Cream Cheese on a toasted Bagel. The bagel was the first proper sized bagel I had in Arizona. It didn't have the East Coast Chew to it but hey this is Chicago Style in Arizona. The correct size was enjoyable to eat most bagels here are too big. The sandwich was good and everything in it was fresh.  My husband had the Pastrami on rye. The Rye bread was a good kind of rye and not that boring wimpy tasting Arizona Rye. I did get to taste a piece of the pastrami and it was prepared very carefully and was very succulent and juicy but very mildly seasoned almost but not quite and seemed closer in taste to East Coast Corned Beef. Not my style of pastrami but it was good and very fresh. The potato salad was seasoned nicely.  Service was friendly and helpful.  3.5 stars

We tried Zinc Bistro for the Restaurant Week Menu.  We both started with the Vichyssoise (Classic cold potato leek soup) The Zinc Bistro's version of this soup was kicked up a BUNCH with these tasty Salmon Croquettes topped with PASTRAMI CURED SALMON topped with radish and lemon pickled onion. The creamy soup was laced with what I think was leek oil and what I think was Esplette and was great alone but with the addition of the adorned Croquettes it became amazing and really was one of the best things I had anywhere this year. This soup was OUTSTANDING and should be on the summer menu as it was PERFECTION for a summer meal.    I sure didn't mind ordering Scottish Salmon for dinner as it was meticulously well crafted with many little details. They took the time to roast a baby fennel till it turned caramelized. They Pickled a pretty red Endive and turned it into something interesting and pretty. The nicely crusted and seasoned Salmon sorted of popped a little with the addition of sweet and tangy Kumquats. This all at on a pillow of creamy rich puree studded with Beluga Lentils that pop in your mouth like caviar.   The Confit Lamb Shank was just as wonderful being melt in your mouth perfect and was a gastronomic journey of Moroccan Style Seasonings with interesting crafted vegetables.  The Hazelnut Toffee Chocolate Torte was good and rich! The creamy Ice cream seemed to lighten it up a bit and the Burnt Orange Honey Carmel complimented it very well.  The Show Stopper Dessert was the Canelles De Bordeaux with Vanilla Brandied Cherries, Espresso & Valhrona Mousse. The little Cake Towers were delicious and had a texture like no other. They were firm and almost caramelized and the inside sort of melted in your mouth and had a rich pastry cream taste and soaked up the light very chocolate Mousse and Cherries. It was maybe the best dessert I had this year!  Service was friendly and efficient.   This was a Great Dinner!

The food made me feel like I was in Purgatory.  This restaurant is older and dated looking. The decor is perhaps entertaining. They have a cut away ceiling that looks like an artificial sky. Unless you are blind you will view a very large mural of a naked woman with nude cherubs flying above her and other various Italian artworks and Portraits.   As soon as I tasted the bread and seasoned oil I became uncertain about how dinner would be. The bread tasted like that frozen bread dough that comes in a can and the extra virgin olive oil was oddly flavorless.  Really I don't need to describe my husband's Florentine Cannelloni too much because if you take the time to view the photo you can see it looks like a coyote took a dump on the plate. The dump part was actually dried up crushed meatballs and other God knows what else. I was told by my husband that the inside of the cannelloni's were awful. My husband just kept saying,"not good" "not good". I did taste one of the gnocchi on his plate. It was much firmer than I was expecting and was a very chewy lump of dough that was covered with a mushroomy tasting paste that was just reminded me of the paste  that came in the plastic tub you used in elementary school but it was mushroom flavored paste.  The actual on-line menu differs from the menu at the restaurant. I like Sun Fish and was expecting to order it but I noticed it wasn't on the menu so I went with the Salmon Francesca. I didn't expect the best quality fish since this isn't a fish place but I was shooting for OK since it was $23.99. At that price point IT SHOULD BE OK!  I took a bite of the fish and tasted a very overpowering sour tangy garlicy sauce. The lemon butter, white wine, caper sauce was so strong in flavor I actually couldn't taste the fish at all until the third bite. Then I knew why the sauce was so strong. The fish had that off taste. It wasn't spoiled but it was that off taste like when you purchase fish from Fry's or Safeway kind of taste. I couldn't eat it after the third bite. The vegetables on the plate were OK and the the Italian Potato was tasty but would have been better if the cheese wasn't dried out and crunchy on it.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and entertaining. I considered giving this place another star just because of the waiter. Before I knew how the fish was our waiter did ask us how the food was and I did tell him about the sauce.  He said that if we came back they could do the dish different for me.    Good Luck!  If you give this place a try you should use the coupon on their website or one of the other various discounts they offer.  1.5 stars

This tiny place is sort of shabby chic and looks like a place that belongs in an art district.   They have a weekend lunch menu that offers not only breakfast but also lunch choices.  I decided to try the HOUSE-Made-hickory smoked salmon plate that included, watercress fennel slaw and jalapeño potato pancakes with herbed goat cheese and condiments. The salmon was bone free and skinless and smoked nicely not too heavy. The fennel slaw was very good light and refreshing with a lot of orange in it. The potato pancakes had great flavor but I wasn't a fan of the texture, it was like a thawed veggie burger sort of mushy but like I already said the flavor was very good. Everything on the plate tasted good individually.  My husband tried a chorizo omelet, same as my meal the flavors were very good but the texture of the omelet could have been lighter.  Over all because of the nice seasonings they are worth a try but the cute sugar bowls need to say hello to some brass cleaner.

The food we tried was VERY GOOD and VERY ABOVE AVERAGE and I am sure to return. This restaurant has five star potential.  I liked that they serve you complimentary hot tea with your meal.  The menu is somewhat assorted Asian and offers many Chinese Favorites, some not so common Chinese, some Thai and a few other Asian dishes. The pricing does run on the high side and portions that we had were small but the food we tried was VERY GOOD and was close to authentic style and this is a rare find!  I had the Spicy Chicken and Cucumber Salad. The moist tender white meat chicken was poached to perfection and the cucumbers were carefully deseeded and trimmed. They were in a tasty not too spicy gingery, garlicky sauce. This was a delicious refreshing light meal. It reminded me of a Chinese/Hawaiian dish I tried called Cold Ginger Chicken that this dish was very similar to.  My husband had the Szechuan Spicy Beef. The beef was very tender and had been twice cooked. This dish had some heat but wasn't as spicy as Szechuan. The sauce was close to  authentic style and lacked sweetness and the thick texture that your used too in Americanized Chinese Food. This dish was very good.  I was expecting just ok but was pleasantly surprised to find a very good restaurant that serves up very good Asian Food.  This place might be a gem!

I'll tell it as it was, your experience may differ.   The appetizer cheese was tasty and the included salads were good.  The sauce on my fish dinner was a salt lick of maybe a quarter cup of small capers and what tasted like a large amount of spoiled anchovies. This sauce was not edible.  My fish dinner looked like it took a bungee jump to land on my plate. The I am now glad Tiny 2-3 oz fish was about half broken up into maybe twelve pieces.  The side dish of pasta was over cooked and broken up.  The sauce over the pasta tasted like it was made of crushed tomatoes and sugar ONLY.  Over steamed plain pealed broccoli was the high point and only edible portion of the meal.  My husband's ossobucco was under cooked by an hour and tasted like it was boiled (but not boiled enough) in water.  The ossobucco had an inferior brown gravy poured over it instead of a proper braising liquid of wine and broth as it should have been. Under the veal shank was pasta sitting in the inferior brown gravy.  We ate only a couple bits off our plates and didn't want to complain since we were with another couple that picked this restaurant since it is their favorite. I now know their taste differs from ours ....more than I thought.  Service was above average and the restaurant is also above average looking with tablecloths. You might want to give them a try but WE WILL NOT RETURN.

We were going to eat at Beavers Choice but they were closed today. We decided to try Ted's Hot Dogs since so many people everywhere including the workplace rave about this place. Our order was taken and we got to the part were they top your order I noticed they put BBQ sauce on my no sauce chicken sandwich. I didn't want to hold up the long line to ask for a replacement.  THE MAIN REASON FOR THE ONE STAR RATING   I tasted my iced tea and I am not certain what they filled my cup with? I didn't see bubbles for soda but it didn't taste like iced tea but the color was sort of dark. I asked my husband to taste it and he couldn't tell me what it was either. I think it might have been a mix of iced tea and diet soda syrup. I did NOT drink it and took a few sips of my husbands soda. If I can't trust them to give me iced tea that is a problem.   The hot dog is extra fatty and greasy, the BBq chicken sandwich is overpowered with sauce and grizzle. Also  The onion rings were a bag of greasy unseasoned crumbs with only a few pieces of onion.    I know most people Love Ted's and they are most likely OK most of the time so give them a try!

Short Story.  Just edible and far from Best Thai but with very nice service.  Long Story.  Started with Fried Won tons. It was nice that they seemed free of grease and were seasoned nicely but they might have been slightly over cooked since the filling was very dry. It was a little disappointing but not a big deal.  I ordered the Pad Gra Prao. Their spelling, it's spelled many ways but is spicy basil dish that is a very common Classic Thai Dish that is very simple to made as it's basically Fish sauce, garlic, usually Chicken, 1-2 bunches of Basil, Thai chili's and Oil. Better Thai Places do offer this dish Thai Style topped with a crispy fried egg.  My dish lacked basil as it only had maybe two basil leaves in the dish so it didn't have any basil flavor. It was very high on the heat level but had a terribly strong jalapeno flavor to it. (See Photo - those are not bell peppers they are jalapenos! ) The next taste was sugar. This dish was very very sweet. Honestly it was so sweet it could be good on pancakes or ice cream. The dish might have had fish sauce in it but it wasn't enough and lacked that funk flavor that balances the flavors and makes the dish delicious. Lastly the chicken was on the dry side, still edible but dry.  Many people do say this is one of the best Thai Places in town so I don't know if it was an off day or maybe I ordered the dish they do least well?  2.5 stars

The sushi was fresh and was seasoned under the fish and didn't fall apart when handling.   The Bento Box C ($12.95) comes with miso soup and is large enough to feed an army. The chicken teriyaki was a little dry but not bad and was tasty. The spicy rolls weren't spicy unless you dipped them in sauce.   The wasabi is green here and the ginger is white.  This place is small but casual and comfortable.

Tokyo Lobby serves up the highest quality sushi in this immediate area. I can't eat poor or mediocre sushi and can taste the difference. Since my favorite sushi place changed hands I haven't found edible tuna in the immediate area until my return to Tokyo Lobby. For $2.00 you can order real wasabi sauce here and you can request the Fish Collar that they call Jaw here. I did find that the service was a little hit and miss as the one server never gave me my wasabi but I was able to get it from the other server and in the end I left very happy.  Best sushi in the immediate area that I know of.

I'm not saying this to be mean but what my inexperienced waitress did to me was comical and not excusable. I DO NOTE I am NOT basing my review on what she did and only the food but I feel it needs to be told so you see the whole picture.  She took our order and soon came to deliver the drinks . Her tray had three beverages a water an iced tea and a soda. Somehow she sorts of looses her balance and almost lost the water and it spills ON ME with Iced cubes hitting me but she manages to save it before it all splashes me. She said she was sorry but she suggested to ME TO CLEAN THE TABLE WITH THE PAPER TOWEL MYSELF! It's bad enough that she couldn't be bothered to clean that up but what really made it WORST was she left the wet napkin on the table the whole time we were dining. I do note she was very youthful and might have been only 15 or 16 years old so I have to chalk it up to that but I also note the cooks on the night I was here were also very youthful looking and I might not have experienced the food as it was meant to be prepared.  We started out with very average house salads and fried pickles appetizer. The salads seemed fresh and the dressing seemed bottled tasting and not so good. I thought the pickle appetizer was inedible not because of them being wet laden with oil but because of how overly salted they were. My husband who tolerates more salt than me didn't think inedible but he felt too that they were over salted and he ate only a few.  Our two plates arrive and my husband got nearly everything they make on his plate and asked me to try stuff I didn't have. I only tried his short rib and had to stop there because it was DRY and almost cold. (YUK!) so then I moved on to my plate. I tried the BBQ'd Turkey first. It was almost good with good flavors and not too much sauce. I also liked that the sauce wasn't too sweet but like the Rib it was dry and almost cold. (YUK! again) So I figure maybe the chicken is good but I was WRONG again. (YUK!) Another almost COLD and VERY DRY. I really hate dry chicken. I had a nice looking side of vegetables but sadly they were ruined by a generous hand of BUDGET SEASONING SALT that tasted awful. Lastly I was hoping the corn bread would be ok but I WAS WRONG AGAIN and SADLY it was so dry and so from the box tasting even soaking it in honey butter couldn't fix it.  I do note my husband said the store purchased hot link wasn't as dry as the BBQ'd other items. He also said the pork ribs were better than the beef rib. I also need to say  I hope that the day time crew prepares the food in the way the owner meant it to be. I say that because of the numerous BBQ awards they've earned that I saw here while dining. But.......   Only one word..........   PITIFUL

This is a family owned and operated restaurant. We started with golden margaritas they arrived and almost tasted good but it was like drinking half water and half drink.   I didn't care for either salsa, one was smooth tomato puree that was just very hot and the other fresh tomato one was very watery and smooth with barely any flavor like the margaritas.  I ORDERED a grilled CHICKEN salad. As my luck would have it the waiter presents me with a grilled BEEF salad. I didn't say anything and just accepted it. The salad really was OK with grilled mushrooms and some onions the beef was OK but not seasoned. I was afraid to use the dressing that came with it because it was bubbling a bit.  My husband had a platter with steak, sauce, onions, fresh roasted jalapeño and cheese all melted up with rice and beans, he said it was good.   We got good and not so good.  2.5 stars

But it's a good two stars if that makes any sense at all. Better than taco bell (I would rate taco bell a one star). You are not going to leave and say what ever you had was the yummiest whatever. I've been here a number of times over the years and the last time I had a chicken taco salad. I don't know if it was a bad day for chicken but the day I had the chicken it was terribly dry and awful. I was afraid to order chicken again and since I don't usually eat beef on a salad I asked for fish instead. They gave me fish I don't know but I think it was tilapia. The fish wasn't oily but I could taste pre used sort of burnt tasting pan oil on it. My salad was very average with an unripe tomato wedge on it. I thought the salsas were good this time and it also was a good day for guacamole.   My husband had the carnitas and they were not like he expected but thought they were passable. (see photo and you will know what I mean)  This food is just passable and sadly one of the better of the fast casual Mexi places in the area.  The $3.75 Margaritas are very strong and the food will seem better if you suck one down before you eat.

Caramba isn't the Best or most Authentic Mexican Food but it is a Budget Family Friendly Place that happens to serve some seriously VERY strong $3.75 Margaritas. (I think they were $3.75)  It's casual as you order at the counter, seat yourself and wait for your number to be called.   They also serve breakfast items all day and all your Mexi Favorites.  Caramba is a better alternative to Taco Bell or Chipolte and offers a large patio and is one of the better fast casual Mexican Restaurants in the immediate area.  Many Caramba locations are in the area.

I've forgotten how Great this place is , I used to only go at lunch time and dine with a friend but now I rediscovered it . The lunch specials are big and interesting and had variety so we always shared one something like soup , salad , some sushi , something fried and rice .   When you walk in you see samples of maybe up to 4 specials to give you an idea of what you might want to try .   Last night some of what we saw was (I think it was?) a Yellow Tail Jaw platter that looked really good and various sushi rolls one topped with lots of fried onions and another that was so colorful and interesting looking we had to try it called a snow white roll made up of a mild cooked white fish and avocado rolled over top and what looked like ahi inside with a battered shrimp running threw so it was a mix of raw and cooked and we shared a spicy salmon roll . Unlike other sushi I had before it was easier to eat more of the sushi here because it didn't have that extra heavy ring of rice around it and the spicy salmon wasn't all mayo-ed up like from some places my plate also had threads of radish topped with spicy sauce .   I now want to go back and try the dinner menu that I didn't know they had with maybe a stir fried white fish or 10 spice salmon? they also have breaded pork and breaded chicken and teriyaki .   If you drink Kirin Beer you can buy a decent appetizer off the .50 cents-$1.00 menu (with purchase of beer)   Dinner was approx $25 before tip...FOR TWO PEOPLE    I can't wait to go back

I had the most SUCCULENT salmon cheeks here that I have ever had , they were seasoned so interesting they were almost sweet and almost salty with the lightest crispness on the outside , they were perfection .     (one of the specials)   We shared some very fresh sushi and a special of the evening roll that had great textures and taste to it that had a center of fried chicken made with fresh tuna and salmon covered with a tasty sauce. My only criticism is that the sushi and rolls are made in pieces that are too big to eat in one bite .  I am not an expert with sushi and only understand freshness , taste and artistry . I don't know how this compares to other places but I can say for sure we were VERY PLEASED Everything was very fresh , tasty and the service was so good we were treated like we were rock stars and the meal ended with a well groomed complimentary orange that tasted better than any orange I buy anywhere.  For approx $12 a person (most rolls and plates of sushi are around that price) at dinner time you can really feast well !

I don't know if I came on an off night or if this place has declined in quality on preparation of sushi because I have had better here in the past. The last time I was here I thought the sushi was also a little less good than the time before that but this time it seemed even less good.  We started with a boat of tuna, salmon and yellow tail sushi. All the sushi was extremely large and hard too hard to eat whole as you should. I had to cut them in half with my chopstick. I also noticed that the yellow tail and the salmon weren't seasoned under the fish again but the tuna did have something under the the fish something that looked like ponzu.  The salmon one was good and fresh and was the highlight of the evening, also the rice was better than last time and didn't fall apart. I didn't try the tuna but I did try just half of the yellow tail and this was the first yellow tail I've ever had anywhere that I didn't like. The fish was very thick and instead of yummy sushi it just tasted like raw fish that had an unpleasant connective tissue threw the meat of the fish making it chewy and not good in the mouth. I do note that even the slightly dried out yellow tail sushi from a nearby budget buffet (with health code violations) puts out better tasting yellow tail sushi. So I didn't want my other half and my husband agreed with me and said it wasn't so good.  We also had two orders of rolls and picked the spicy tuna and the spicy salmon. They were a choking hazard to eat as large as they were. The sushi also wasn't rolled so nice and seemed less well rolled than from budget buffet sushi place. I did try one as is (the smallest on the end) and I didn't know if I could hold it all in my mouth and felt like a chipmunk trying to eat it. I could only eat them if I cut them in half and they really weren't so tasty. I had very tasty spicy tuna from one of the participants at the devoured culinary festival earlier in the day so I do know what tasty yummy spicy tuna should taste like and this sure wasn't it.  Sadly service wasn't so great. The people who came in after us received four rounds of plates before we received our first plate. Plenty of people checked on us but it didn't seem sincere but just quick and going threw the motions. The check was dropped off and they FORGOT AGAIN to give us that yummy orange that they gave everyone else.   In the past I did enjoy the fish collar specials  from here and the fish stir fry was good here but the sushi has gone down too much for me and there are many other sushi places in this area so I say SAYOUNARA to Sakana for sushi for sure.

I haven't been here in years and stopped here after my first choice didn't work out. I know Pei Wei isn't the best food but honestly I don't remember it being this bad. I should have left when I had a hard time finding clean silverware in the silverware bin. I picked about 6 forks before I could find one without paper stuck to it.  I soon receive my Ginger Broccoli with Chicken. It didn't look bad but the taste was just like really BAD Asian Buffet Food. The sauce tasted like very salty soy sauce mixed with an artificial chemically flavored sweet syrup of some sort kind. I didn't taste any ginger at all in this dish. I don't know what they did to the broccoli but it tasted super strong like maybe it was decomposing. The chicken was passable and better than spongy fake whipped with filler chicken from the Subway Chain. They gave me enough rice to feed four people but it was polluted from that not good tasting sauce.  When I hear Pei Wei I will say NO WAY!  Never Again

Five Stars IS A LIE. but what difference does it make since they are closed now. I feel terrible I never told the owner that people (the cook)  she trusted did horrible in her absence. The food really was better when SHE was cooking.. I liked her chicken  cacciatore  that she took off the menu years ago. Her eggplant was light and never greasy. My husband liked her braciole. I should have told her what  was best she done. I feel sick to my stomach that her place is gone since I had many good memories here. I went there with friends.She made buttered noodles for my hard to please niece and my my nephew really liked the food.Not to mention my in laws. It was a neighborhood kind of place.

Sweet Tomatoes reminds me of those store purchased cookies from my childhood called Almost Home Cookies. They were almost good but weren't. Sweet Tomatoes is Almost good but also isn't. I tried a variety of things and couldn't find one thing that was good to me except for the service.  I made myself a nice big salad with mostly nice produce but whatever dressings were in the salad mix tasted awful to me so my whole nice almost good salad didn't taste good.  I tried the Thai Cole Slaw and after a bite I was done with that. It was almost good made with nice fresh vegetables but lacked the taste I wanted.   I tried some sort of pasta salad with turkey and the seasoning just wasn't tasty. It was almost good but wasn't. The pasta was very squishy and turned to mush and the turkey had a strong turkey taste to it so it needed a good flavor to cover that up.  I tried a piece of grilled chicken, it was moist but was over seasoned with some sort of Italian concoction that tasted awful. Too much dry maybe old herbs. Seemed like it could have been good chicken but wasn't.  Tried a little square of pizza. Wow that was bad and not close to almost good. It's kind of like Wonder Bread with tasteless sauce and almost no cheese.  Tried a spoonful of Macaroni and cheese, it was maybe slightly better than the blue box stuff and seemed similar to that with maybe some added real cheese.   I thought the sweet potato plain might be good. It was a real potato but it was water logged and seemed like it was steamed with lots of water entering the potato making it a watery potato like baby food.  The soft serve was almost good. It tasted watered down but was thick. The metal bowls were nice that kept the ice cream cold.  Maybe the worst thing I tried was the sweet orange cranberry muffin. It wasn't sweet and had raisins in it instead of cranberries. It just was very unappetizing and was very bread like.  Almost good........ but wasn't.  Sorry to put it that way but that's the way the cookie crumbles.  1.5 stars

A Very Solid Above Average Chinese Restaurant for Sure!  I wish I had more time in town to try the Abalone or Geoduck , Braised Tofu with Bamboo Fungus and bunches of other things I never had before.  I tried the vegetable rolls and being honest they were very average but we wanted something vegetable with the dish we shared.  I was very impressed with the Crispy Fried Whole Fish (Flounder) with Spicy Tofu and Beef. The sauce it was in just hits all the right places in your mouth. You get a slight amount of sweet and you also get a little sour from a pickled vegetable. You get SPICE I'd say about a 6.5 on a Thai Food Scale and you get deliciousness from garlic ginger and other ingredients. The beef just adds a little body to the sauce. The fish was very sweet and fresh tasting and very moist. It's very large and enough for two people to share at lunch time but for dinner I think one person can handle it because the fish is very flat so it's not as much food as it looks. They use plain silken tofu with the dish and it's just in the sauce on top of the fish. It's a little difficult to eat with the one fork but it really is extremely tasty and worth it.  They feature dishes made with a variety of live fish from tanks.  Joyful House Chinese Makes Joyful Meals!  A new favorite  4.5 stars

After a second visit I realize that not only is Joyful House above average Chinese but they are also very high end Chinese Dining.  Where else can you order Geoduck and not too many places offer Abalone. I do note that these are very high end luxury seafood items and do cost around $60. $70. a portion. They also have a variety of many reasonably priced fresh fish dishes and daily specials. Free range chicken is also on the menu. (I've never seen that at any other Chinese Restaurant).  We ordered the Sweet Corn Soup for two. Actually the portion is enormous and can feed 4-6 people. It's delicious and anyone would enjoy it. Our waitress offered us a hot chili sauce and soy sauce condiments with the soup.  I had to try the Braised Tofu with Bamboo Fungus. (I think it cost around $12.00) The presentation isn't good but the dish actually tasted good. Bamboo Fungus is actually a veil from a mushroom grown in Asia. It really has almost no flavor on it's own but does have a most interesting delicate texture and is suppose to be extremely beneficial to your health. Under the Tofu and Bamboo Fungus was a large pile of fresh Chinese Broccoli.  The Special of the day was Whole Flounder for $23.00 so we ordered one fried and it was served  de-Boned Table side.  Joyful House was a Joyful Experience and is on my Las Vegas Rotation!

It's terrible that Nylabone Nubs (Dog Treats) are only sold at Costco and Costco is currently not selling them in Arizona. I called this store and the Glendale location and both stores say these edible natural dog treats have been deleted from the system. The Nubs are tremendously tasty to dogs and I think they have some kind of dog crack in them because my dogs are hooked. My dogs are very unhappy and told me to give all the Costco's a one star rating but I will give two stars just in case they bring them back.  BTW the shoppers here sneak in pets, leave loose carts by your car and this location often has moldy produce.

Costco has many redeeming qualities. Not all but just a few of these redeeming qualities are great big savings on.....  Car Tires Dry Goods Some Produce Sometimes Fresh Fish Healthy Natural Dog Chews Called Nubz ( A Costco Exclusive ) Offered Occasionally Big Bottles Of Booze cheap  They also do food demos that some people call lunch.  This store SOMETIMES has problems with too much moldy produce (see photos) and too many loose carts in the parking lot. (see photos)  They also occasionally let people in with their pets. (see photos)  I somewhat forgive them for most of their faults but need to drop them a star for MESSING WITH MY CHICKEN.  I liked the packaged chicken they used to sell but they replaced that better chicken with Foster Farms Chicken. I don't think Foster Farms is bad chicken but it's just OK chicken that I could buy at Fry's. (If I wanted to.) The breast and thighs are much smaller and lighter color meat with less flavor than the other chicken they used to sell for the same price.   Meh. I've just experienced better Chicken someplace else.

You most likely will not agree with us on this one but that's OK and I say that because of the Yelp Rating and the crowd I saw while dining here my Yelp is being based on two lunches .  As soon as we were seated we received a bowl of chip crumbs that were dripping with oil and a small dish of what I think was sweet and sour sauce the color was  red .  Next came our cup of soup and we both picked Egg Drop the soup was actually very good and fresh and  that made me think our meals would be great !  Soon our meals came and they were VERY LARGE and also came with egg rolls and fried wantons both were fried to a cigar color I didn't eat them and steamed white rice (the rice was good) But my meal called Amazing Chicken had this sauce on it that tasted like sweet and sour sauce mixed with wing sauce and I tried to eat it but after a few pieces I lost my appetite and it is a shame because the vegetables were fresh and nice , the chicken was tender juicy not spongy it was cooked nice but that sauce killed the dish for me .  My husband didn't care for the sauce that came on his lotus dish but I think he didn't care for the fried rice even more because he thought it was rice with basically just soy sauce .   Nobody checked on us .  When the busboy noticed our pushed away plates he didn't even ask if I wanted to take it with me...guess he knew I didn't

We tried eating the food but it was just like trying to fry water, it's a YIKES and Eeks! Methinks not!  We also got the same service as Yelper Susan D. We got the impression that we were a bother coming in but we got that treatment from two women working there. But I did get a smile from the one woman when she saw we stopped trying to eat and left almost all our food and she offers boxes I say no then she says, "YOU NO LIKE" I just smiled back and that is when I got the smile or maybe she was holding in laughing not sure.  I will say I did like the hot tea we started out with and my husband got the $3 extra soup , egg roll , crab puff add on . My husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy . I ate the crab puffs and they were fried nice and the oil seemed fresh I thought the crab puffs were better than most places because they almost looked like crabs . At this point the service didn't bother me because I thought the food would be good .  I ordered the spicy eggplant with chicken and I don't know how it was prepared but the chicken was minced unseasoned  hard and dry , the chicken was NOT EDIBLE . The sauce was not spicy it was like they dumped egg drop soup (with out the egg) over the chicken and stir fried eggplant. The thick chicken soup or sauce didn't taste good it seemed house made but it seemed like they didn't use any aromatics or salt or pepper in preparation and instead of good the sauce tasted like the way raw chicken smells also lacking any Asian Seasoning . Wong's was generous with the amount of eggplant in my dish but I couldn't stomach the sauce on it. I ate mostly steamed rice I think it was regular rice because it fell off my fork and didn't stick.  My husband ordered the Szechan Beef and neither of us could eat that one either although it was very slightly better than the spicy eggplant chicken . The beef was tough but it was seasoned but not in a good way it was very salty and I think like you dumped soy sauce on it . The sauce tasted very thick like brown gravy mixed with soy sauce and vegetables were mostly celery and a few mushrooms .  I know I already said enough but depending on where you sit in the dining room you might have a strangers butt near your face because half the dining room is raised and you might be next to that and who know, that person might need beano .  I would NEVER SAY not to go here, You might like your food that way. Also I am guessing and Hope the REAL COOK wasn't on and they are normally better....I HOPE  My husband left hungry and stopped at the Hot Diggity Dog Cafe Cart that sets up at the Home Depot Parking lot on Bell and 67TH he said the $4. Chicago Style dog was really good and said he'd stop there whenever we get bad food out. I lost my appetite.

When you step into this quaint restaurant it appears that you truly are stepping into a small Bosnian town complete with Bosnian Natives. You see doorways and Bosnian artifacts. It's sort of like Disney Land. The menu is very meat and bread heavy so you have to plan for that. I had a chicken sandwich made with their house made bread. The bread was unlike any bread I had before and had a similar texture to a fluffy glazed donut and was tasty but a little greasy. My chicken was pounded very thin but was tender, juicy and seasoned well. I had added mushrooms and ajvar (roasted red pepper and eggplant condiment) to my sandwich. The ajvar seemed fresh made and was very mild. They gave me a generous amount of mushrooms that lacked caramelization. The sandwich was tasty but is a lot of bread so I ate it open faced so I wouldn't eat too much bread.  My husband had a cup of bean soup that was very porky and the popular spicy beef sausage sandwich. The sausage is skinless and is spicy but not very spicy.   Since it was our first time here our waitress wouldn't let us leave without trying a Bosnian Candy. She gave us a chocolate covered candy that looked like a banana. It tasted like a banana flavored circus peanut that was chocolate covered.  Among the most interesting restaurants to try because it was like a trip to Bosnia.

If you are a fan of the Subway Chain or On- Cor Frozen Dinners this is the place for YOU!  My husband tried the recommended George's Special. It's almost an Italian Style Hoagie. The quality of the meats aren't as bad as Subway but it was pre-portioned and made possibly days in advance and is all old and squashed together. They apologized to us and said they didn't have their normal rolls. The roll they had when we were there was a squishy roll that fell apart. The sandwich was dressed with a not so tasty dressing.  But on the bright side they do have hot peppers as an option.  They offer a sandwich of the day and also have a special board. The special of the day was Eggplant Rollatini. I thought that sounds good I'll try that. They all start running around and maybe five minutes later they tell me they are out of Eggplant Rollatini and my husband spots them pulling out from the freezer a big plastic frozen tray of them.   So I go for the Sandwich of the day. It was corned beef on a roll. I asked them to put it on rye instead because that would taste better. They asked me if I wanted it cold or warm and I answered warm please. The people working seemed very confused making my sandwich. They toasted my bread and popped the corned beef in the microwave. It was a very generous portion of corned beef but it was a mediocre quality. I tried a side of cole slaw and it seemed very processed.  I saw chicken parmesan patties under a heat lamp and they looked like they were formed and processed just like those On-Cor Frozen Dinners that I remember from my childhood.  My husband purchased some of their house made Hot sausage. He cooked it as soon as we got home. He said it had a good flavor but it was unusually dry.  I would never come here again to eat anything but the store here is above average for an Italian Deli place.  1.5 Stars Rounded up for the store.

There ( almost ) is no need to hop the Marrakech Express since we have Alzohour Market right here in Phoenix. Islamic clothing , groceries and other items are sold here but there also is a very modest small Moroccan Restaurant and Bakery here. The food we tried was delicious. Service was VERY pleasant but terribly slow. I think it took them a half hour to bring our beverages. Only one  other small table was in the restaurant and our meal was a two hour stay so that should be noted. I also noticed that table of four people had each plate delivered to them one by one and NOT TOGETHER! I think it might be very hectic for them to serve more than two tables at a time.  We shared the B'Stilla. It's a Moroccan Appetizer. It's a very large House Made Phyllo Pastry stuffed with shredded chicken, almonds, and cinnamon. It very delicious and certainly unique. It really feeds four or more people but we wanted to try it.  Then we shared another Moroccan dish the Fish Tangine. It was Cod on a sizzling skillet in a Tomato based sauce with onions ,  bell peppers , preserved lemons and exotic spices. It was very fragrant and spicy! They gave us side salads and a big plate of fluffy long grain rice to share.  You can get Moroccan without the hassle of going to Marrakech.   This building is Halal that means no pork is in the building and a big wall of A Grade Maricopa inspection reports are posted on the window.

What they did to me at this store WAS NOT SMART and might NOT be Final.  Smart and Final is a no membership smaller big box kind of store.   I like Smart and Final Stores for a few unique items I can't get anywhere else like the grout cleaner that's a miracle in bottle. My grout isn't sealed and this stuff makes it look brand new in an instant. I love it. I also like their vegetable base. I use it when I cook greens with thin sliced onions and people do tell me I make the most delicious greens they ever tasted.There are several other items I also like. I make special trips to Smart and Final once in a while since they closed the location that was convenient to me.  This store isn't so close to me and I stopped here after another Smart and Final was out of one food item that was on my list.  I spotted the item I wanted above the shelf. We got it and took it to the register. It didn't ring up so the cashier called someone. That person left for a minute or two and came back and said that nobody put the price of my item in the system and I was not able to purchase this edible item. They rather have food sit on the self and get old than sell it to me.  They don't live up to their name.  Not SMART and maybe not Final.

With out a doubt this is among the best places in the area to dine and it happens to be a little Ecuadorian Cafe. This place is tiny maybe only five tables and the only server is the chef's husband.   I've been here many times before but I came very often and burnt myself out ordering the same few things so I decided to start fresh and try new things.  They offer many ceviches including an interesting vegetarian variety made with Lupini Beans. I decided to try the Ecuadorian Style Ceviche. We were warned by the server it was very spicy and it was very spicy. It was fresh Cod in lime juice with tomatoes and pickled red onions. This was a very bold dish. They gave us dishes with spoons to eat it but I was getting too much lime and it would have been better with a fork. The pop corn sort of balanced your mouth from all the flavors in this dish. I thought it was a very generous serving.  I really liked the grilled trout because it was seasoned just so and seemed to have a tasty wood fired taste on it. The fish wasn't perfect as the texture was a little off and ever so slightly over cooked but still very delicious. The salad that came with it was made with high end greens and had a tongue pleasing sweet mustard vinaigrette taste to it. I had my choice of side and picked rice. It was fresh and tasted buttered.  I don't remember what my husband's plate was called but I think of it as a man plate sampler. It was tasty tender steak and beans, sausage, crispy pork skin, an egg, avocado, plantains two ways, rice, an arepa and a relish.   It cost very little to dine here as my trout dinner was only $10.95 the value for certain is five stars.

I LOVE love LOVE this PLACE! (how often do I even like a place?) I drive by at least 3 other Chinese Places that are closer to me to come here because the food is just SO MUCH BETTER the food is very flavorful fresh and packed with vegetables never too salty or oily . This is the only place out of  the 4 near me that makes any meal I order really delicious. So far after maybe a half dozen visits I have not been disappointed with any order .  I haven't tried everything but meals that I have tried and can recommend are Chop Suey , Szechan , Dry Sauteed Beef Chow Fun and Yui Shan Eggplant these are all really great ! My favorite is the Szechan Chicken that explodes with great layers of flavors in your mouth  and is also loaded up with a great mix of fancy vegetables too this one dish is 5 stars . I haven't tried anything fried here so far so those dishes you will have to find out .  You do need to know this place is located in an older strip mall and might be considered a dive with one booth held together with much duct tape .   It might be a dive but the food is DELICIOUS so it's worth the drive!

Did you know that Dry Sauteed Beef Chow Fun is a major test for chefs in Cantonese Cooking ? This is not the easiest dish to prepare and requires some skill . New Asian Kitchen makes this dish and it is delicious , it includes tender beef , bean sprouts , onions , snow peas and wide rice noodles . I think the portion is large and two people can share it for dinner. (we did last night)  My favorite meal here is the Szechan Chicken and I usually order that all the time but have had other dishes that were all good.    slight update Feb-6-12 NEW AND PRETTY DECOR

This Chinese is the best that I've found in this area and I have close to a half dozen places that are closer but non of them have make food so tasty flavorful and fresh like New Asian Kitchen always does.   Last night I had my favorite the Szechuan Chicken it was great like it always is. My husband had a cup of House Wor Wonton Soup and the Kung Pao Delight.  The bill including two drinks was only ONLY $22.85 before tax and tip.  They remodeled and are modern and clean looking.

I agree with Ryan C on this one. New Asian Kitchen is the best small and independent fast food Chinese of it's kind in the area. Nobody in a several mile radius makes Chinese Food as tasty. Food packed with lots of fresh vegetables and great flavors. They even make the very hard to make Cantonese Dry Sauteed Beef Chow Fun that's considered a major test for Cantonese Chefs for cooking and their version is very good indeed and you will not see that dish at most places I note. My personal favorites are the Szechuan Chicken, the  Curry Chicken and the Yui Shan Eggplant. Lately they don't make these dishes as spicy as they use to make them but they are so flavorful it doesn't matter. The people that own the place are very nice and they will make anything within reason for you.  I have at least a half dozen places that are closer that aren't nearly as good.  This place isn't fancy  at all but it seems clean and is very reasonably priced.

Cowboy Ciao is located in the downtown arts district in old town Scottsdale. If you can't find a parking space don't worry because there is a nearby free parking garage. They serve up American chow with global accents in a casual but slightly upscale shabby chic environment. One specialty might be the catalog of wine they offer. You will be there all night if you read the whole catalog. We tried a bottle of wine and we liked it so we looked it up online and found that they really didn't charge too much more over the online price so maybe you can get a similar deal.  My rating is based on one Restaurant Week dining experience.  I started with the Squash Blossoms. They were light, seemed oil free and were packed with unusual ingredients like huitlacoche. They were so tasty I could have eaten a big bowl of them.  My husband had the duck skewer. I didn't taste it but my husband said it was seasoned nicely but was bloody rare. He might have sent it back but nobody asked how it was so he just ate it anyway.  We shared the Famous Mushroom Pan Fry and everyone is telling the truth...This really was a delicious dish. Very mushroomy and tasty. You could slap it on a dirty old sneaker and it would be delicious.  We were right in the middle of enjoying the mushrooms and our waiter squeezes our dinner plates on the table. My husband says something like I guess our dinners will get cold and the waiter doesn't say a word....Timing was slightly off and it made us feel sort of rushed at that moment.  My Ahi Tuna was interesting with Jerk Seasoning. I thought there were a lot of flavors there. I tasted a piece of my husband's Hanger Steak. It was tasty and the black garlic potatoes were good too.   For dessert we had the Brookie Sundae and the Peach Brioche Bread Pudding with Bourbon PralineBrown Sugar Streusel. Both desserts were good but the flavors and textures in the bread pudding were more exciting than the Brookie but both were good.  You might want to know that the temperature is different in various locations in the restaurant. By the windows it seemed like a good 20-30 degrees hotter than near the ladies room where it seemed very cold.  Sure had a Blast at Cowboy Ciao!

That Dinner was "IMPOSSIBLE" to TOP last night at THE LUNCH & LEARN is just the VERY best that you can treat yourself too.  Chef Robert Irvine of Food Network's Dinner: Impossible & Restaurant Impossible Held a Magnificent informative (with recipes to take home of dishes) and entertaining 5 course dinner with wine pairing at this breathtaking resort. Some question and answering was done,some door prizes and cooking demos by Chef Robert Irvine. Chef Beau MacMillan was the host and good natured target of much of the entertainment. Live and DJ music too!  The Menu started with a trio of oysters, (all different) paired with a sparkling wine  five spice dusted seared sturgeon with apple nage,barley compote,carrot slaw,paired with Simi Chardonnay (all the pairing were spot on but this pairing was the most perfect to me it was magic,I normally don't like chardonnay but with this wonderful food it was great)  pan seared mahi-mahi , orange kim chi sauce, jasmine rice , celery salad paired with Simi Pinot Noir (this was my favorite dish the flavors were very layered and most interesting and will try to make at home)  herb roasted strip steak,creamed potato,english peas,demi glace paired with a Simi Cab (he told us he infused the steak with freeze dried blue cheese and butter,it was really incredible but I don't see these details on the recipes he gave us)  tiny chocolate brownies  Chilled grapefruit souffle with orange mint salad,chocolate jus,sabayon (this was great the souffle was like eating ice-cream)  Service was over the top and they were VERY GENEROUS with the wine pouring   very well worth every penny we spent  This was the VERY BEST DINNER out we've had in two years  I highly recommend  the Lunch & Learn at Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain

Based on the Szechwan Chicken and the Spicy Chicken dishes two stars seems about right.  The menu here states that the spicy chicken would be in a bean sauce but we received it in approximately eighty percent sriracha sauce and the rest was mostly oil. This was the better dish.  The Szechwan Chicken I couldn't eat because it was extremely sweet and could have passed for a dessert sauce.  Both meals were made with nicely cooked white meat chicken. The vegetables in both dishes were bell peppers, onions and mushrooms that were a good ratio. They gave us two plates of white rice that were approximately three cups each.  Maybe other dishes on the menu are better I don't know.  This place is very casual you order at the counter and seat yourself.  I do note this place is very clean and spotless.

Great little hideaway that is nestled by an outstanding wine shop. They offered many different unusual appetizers that sounded amazing but we skipped them to save room for an end of meal cheese plate.   We started with salads my husband had one with mixed greens nuts and duck and I had a grilled romaine salad with a fried duck egg on it. My only slight criticism on food preparation was the execution of the egg was off with too much raw white and the bottom almost burnt so I pushed to the side the parts of the egg that I couldn't eat. But over all we were happy with the salads and they came out quickly.   The food is slowly prepared and I think we waited an hour or so for the dinners from the time we ordered. I had the Fresh Halibut with Calabrian Aioli topped with toasted pine nuts surrounded by assorted roasted vegetables , fresh spring peas , micro greens and fingerling potatoes. My fish was prepared well and seasoned perfect it was salty but a good salty not too salty and the flavors of the light aioli and pine nuts went well together with the fish. Each vegetable did have a different taste the carrots were lemony and the baby cipollini onions were smoky and so on. The fingerlings were prepared well being crispy on the cut side but still showcasing the creamy quality a fingerling is my portions were generous. My Husband enjoyed his hanger steak topped with a basil bacon sauce served with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.   We really enjoyed the cheese plate, I picked a local non-tangy maybe a goat cheese dusted with fennel pollen , a robiola , a taleggio and another local cheese a havarti all these cheeses were worth the calories all were very good. We also received VERY GOOD tasty bread with the cheese with a side of very soft smoked butter. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS Todd should have told us he was adding on a $4. charge to give us bread with the cheese. WE DIDN'T ORDER or ask for bread OR THEY SHOULD just add $4 to the cheese $12 plate and just make it $16 on the menu so nobody is mad but I do note the bread was very good.   Linens were crisp and clean silverware and glasses were sparkling. Service was friendly and knowledgeable.  The only thing bad about BYOB ($10 fee) is you might bring a wine that doesn't match your food as we did but we had plenty of time to enjoy the wine between plates and with the cheese.  Next door we found a VERY HARD TO GET Pride Syrah it is always sold out from the winery and the ride to get it is officially the second scariest drive to do in Sonoma. It should be excellent! WOOHOO!

This visit here was very different from my last visit. The Chefs have changed and I'm here for Restaurant Week. Instead of a menu with many selections we only saw a Restaurant Week Menu that differed not completely but somewhat from the one posted on the Web. I do NOTE that on the Website they do post, "Menu is subject to availability as we source all of our ingredients from very small producers."   What I liked about the menu here for restaurant week is that they offer three courses of a starter, a salad and an entree so I thought that seemed very good since it's a waste of calories ordering dessert UNLESS of course it's an outstanding dessert.  They started us off with an amuse bouche of very creamy but also very velvety cream of cauliflower soup. My very rich little soup had crispy heirloom roasted cauliflower in it as croutons and was a nice surprise, also topped with a cheesy crostini.  My starter was the Hand Rolled Ricotta Gnocchi, they were very light in texture and were well seasoned with herbs,  seasoning and then were lightly crisped. The gnocchi mingled with with lots of tiny sweet local sun gold tomatoes and different sauces adorned the plate.  My husband enjoyed a well crafted Wagu Beef Bone Marrow duo. One was adorned with lamb bacon and the other with a sort of onion jam.  As delicious as the the heirloom sun gold tomatoes were in my starter dish I had very similar tomatoes again in my tomato salad. They were delicious again and a few other tomatoes joined the tomato party. Fortunately I do love tomatoes, especially this quality tomatoes and can eat them all the time. I was looking forward to the jalapeño fritter that was on the web menu but tonights version was crispy seasoned croutons. I enjoyed the tomatoes but the croutons were a little too crisp for me as my fork wasn't able to penetrate the sturdy little cubes. Instead of some kind of cheese curd they made house made ricotta and I think that was a win!  Instead of the Black Grouper with those black tiny lentils that I was looking forward too  I had the halibut since that was what was offered instead. I do have to say the halibut was excellent and prepared to perfection, it was tasty and delicious but it was a very tiny piece as small or smaller weight watchers lunch portion being between two and three ounces. (I'm thinking two) The vegetables on the side were also a very small portion but also excellent and I even enjoyed the sauces, one was lemongrass scented and the other was a tasty pea nage. For my taste I thought the chef was overly creative with the forbidden rice as it had flavors going on with it that weren't savory and seemed odd with everything else going on. I asked my husband to try it and he didn't care for it either but I note other people might like it. So I can't say it was bad I just didn't care for it.  The service was very personal and right on until dinner with only the owner and his helper serving us. Then every seat was filled and they weren't able to check on us and when we were done the helper instead of trying to sell us dessert says something like are you interested in dessert? with what I thought was a stressed look on her face.   The food overall was very good. This is a very TINY place with 5-7 tables (depending on how they are pushed together) You DO need a reservation for here. This is a B.Y.O.B. a $10. cork fee is applied.

Atlas Bistro hires the very best upcoming chefs. The past chefs have moved on and opened some of the best restaurants in the metro Phoenix area. Atlas Bistro is a very tiny upscale ten table restaurant that's B.Y.O.B. It's adjacent to a very good wine shop next door. This restaurant serves up organic, local, wild line caught exotic dishes. All the dishes I had were painstakingly detailed and masterfully prepared.  We started with an amuse bouche of House Smoked Hawaiian Opah Fish with a caper and Lemon Aioli. It was so darn tasty I wish I could have purchased some to bring home.  My first course was a combination of crisp cucumber, sweet watermelon, creamy Israeli Feta, jicama, pickled honeydew, pistachio, fresh mint tied together with watermelon/lime vinaigrette. This was so light but bursted with bright flavors. Just delicious!  My second course was a very detailed beet salad. What stood out were the beets. You can taste how different a just picked beet taste. It has a totally different texture. The whole salad was earthy and bright from the fennel and tangy from the blue cheese. The crisp rye berries added some texture.  Dinner was Wild Hawaiian Hebi Spear Fish. The fish was mild sweet, meaty, moist with a nice tasty crust. This dish had many components but the one that stood out was the beet infused cous cous topped with harissa. It was so darn delicious it was the star of the plate. It had great flavors. I had to fight off my husband from taking too much of it.   Unfortunately I was to full to try one of the interesting sounding desserts.  Being that this is a B.Y.O.B. place I do note your bottle of wine you bring might not pair with the plates you order but if you drink wine between plates it doesn't matter. As of the time of this review the corkage fee is $15.00

Maybe they make good sandwiches but if you order something harder than that you might NOT get something OK to eat .  Not only did I wait 1/2 hour to get my salad after I ordered it but when it arrivered it was awful and mostly not edible.  I ordered the chicken pesto salad and it was smeared maybe bottleld pesto paste smeared sickenly thick on top of breaded chicken breast ....(AWFUL)  the salad could have been great but it wasn't because it was soaked in a fishy Oil that tasted like oil from anchovies it was a bowl of salad drowning in what tasted like oil from anchovies and covered with lots of grated cheese to make the fishy oil all over taste even worse .  Also a big splash of tomato sauce on my salad plate .  This salad was insaulting and disrespectal to anyone .  This truley was one of the worst meals I ever tried to eat .  I left my salad in full display of guest to see  I didn't even complain because I didn't trust them to make me anythingelse and I didn't want to wait another half hour .  I think even a teen at a drive threw would care and make better food I can never try this place again....no care here....I can't eat at a place that is this way .

If you are looking for HIDALGO Regional Cuisine look no further THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!  Brain Cheese Crisp , Cactus Soup , Tacos De Cabeza , Huitlacoche (corn Smut) Barbacoa (Hidalgo State Dish) , Mixiotes and much more .  This place is located in a small strip mall (all Mexican) behind another business so it is hard to see from the road the name is EL TLACOYO .   The cheese crisps or as our waitress call them quesadillas  (a long list of many to try) are really more like flaky crispy dough pockets in a half moon shape  . I didn't have the acquired taste for the corn smut that is considered to be a delicacy or the pumpkin flower either but that is just me because these are very special dishes .  I do have to say as far as chicken burritos go mine was a five star burrito since it was so much tastier than any I had before . The chicken was white meat carefully shredded , very moist and very flavor able with lots of minced onion and cilantro some tomato through out . You can order enchilada style baked with sauce and cheese or without I choose without and really enjoyed the two sauces they give you to try the jalapeno cream sauce that is very layered with flavors and the smokey creamy chili sauce both sauces are EXCELLENT but are spicy maybe a seven out of ten .  I remember seeing lots of Mexican Fish dishes on the menu,I think I saw goat? and I know I saw tripe .  This place is not fancy but is extra special and adds to the diversity of the area and is WELL WORTH a Try!

El Tlacoyo truly feels more Mexican than being in Mexico. I know because I've been in Mexico a few times. You do get something different here and it is Hidalgo Regional Cuisine. Some dishes might be cactus soup, head meat tacos, huitacoche cheese crisp (Mexican Truffle or corn smut) Barbacoa (the Hidalgo State Dish) and Mixotes.   They start you off with two sauces and chips. The green sauce might be an some sort of smooth avocado cream thin sauce that's very spicy and VERY delicious. The red sauce has smoked chills in it and is also very good.  We started with the whats considered to be a delicacy the huitacoche crisp (corn smut or Mexican Truffle). It really was the real deal and was what I tried in Mexico. I liked it much more than last time as it did seem different and not as saucy or cheesy I had it here. It's very earthy and different.   This time I ordered one of the fish dishes and it was the fish with chili. They gave me a WHOLE FISH. I could tell IT WASN'T A FROZEN FISH as it was VERY FRESH with very SWEET MEAT and was very moist. The fish was very nicely seasoned and was FRESH and DELICIOUS. The fish it's self really was one of the BEST fish dishes I've tasted in Arizona and it was only $11.99. The sides were the usual sides you get at most Mariscos (Seafood) Restaurants, they were rice beans and fries with tortillas.  My husband tried the shrimp diablo. ($11.99) It was spicy smokey and slightly sweet. The shrimp were fresh and prepared well. This dish came with rice beans and tortillas.  Service was good and efficient. The menu is English on one side and Mexican on the other side.  El Tlacoyo is NOT A FANCY PLACE at all being very basic but it is a Special Place as you go for the food.  El Tlacoyo is a little hard to find because it's in a tiny strip mall behind another building but it's worth a try because it's A TRUE GEM.  4.5 Stars

El Tiacoyo is not your usual Mexican Restaurant. It's Hidalgo Regional Cuisine. That means you can order things like cow foot tacos, cactus soup, head meat tacos, sausage and intestine tacos, huitiacoche cheese crisp, barbacoa, mixotes and so much more!  They have weekend specials this past weekend it was lamb tacos but on past visits I saw goat and brain tacos.  They start you off with chips and a creamy green very spicy sauce thats very good and a smokey red sauce that's also good and less spicy.   We got the huitiacoche  (also known as corn smut or Mexican Truffle) cheese crisp. It's not the Americanized watered down version it's the real stuff. Very earthy and interesting.   From what I tried so far from here I've found that they do very good fish dishes here very reasonably priced. They don't use that cheap tilapia or muddy tasting swai fish like other places use. From the two fish dishes I tasted it seems like a very fresh sweet snapper kind of fish. This time I tried what they called grilled fish. When I saw it I thought they gave me the wrong thing because I received an aluminum envelope filled with very moist very fresh tasting fish cooked in juices from tomato and onions and a little butter. By looking at the envelope I think they cooked it on the grill. This dish came with average rice and beans and tortillas.   My husband tried the chicken enchiladas, They were made with very fresh tasting chicken and were or mostly were just filled with chicken. The green chili sauce that topped them was very heavy with lime juice.  I should mention that this place is not fancy and is very raw looking so you only come here for the food and not the ambiance. It's also hard to see from the street because it's located behind another building.  4.5 stars I didn't round up to 5 because of the average rice and beans and lack of atmosphere

Short Story  Small, not fancy, cash only, no restroom or hand cleaning station. Chicago Style Dogs and Food.  Tasty Italian Beef Sandwiches and hand cut Fries. Low Prices BIG Portions. FAST!  Longer Story  Dazzo's Dog House appears to be a much loved place of Glendale for Chicago Style Vienna Beef Dogs and other foods. They've been around for decades and I witnessed customers sharing stories about Dazzo's here. The Tiny casual restaurant also is decorated with an assortment of memorabilia and fun antiques including an autographed Alice Cooper Guitar. We placed our order and sat ourselves near the flashing traffic light. Within a minute or two our order was called.   I tried the Italian Beef with Giardiniera. The beef was very tender and very developed with flavor. The bread was a sponge that was soaked with all that beefy goodness and the spicy vegetable topping just made the sandwich pop in my mouth in all the right places. The sandwich is very large and comes with a foil liner so you can bring some home for a snack later if you want.  My husband ordered far more food than he could eat but wanted to try The Fire Dog and the combo sandwich. He liked the dog and the combo sandwich but the dog and sausage come deep-fried slightly more well done than he likes so he would stick with Italian Beef next time. Fries come with all the hotdogs and they are made fresh hand cut in house. The fries were tasty and good.  They make Home Made Italian Water ice! I don't know of anyplace else on the westside offers that! The Water Ice is a Creamy kind of style I'm not familiar with perhaps it's a Chicago Style? Honestly I didn't care for the water ice but that's just me and I'm not holding that against them.  Currently a grade "A" Maricopa Sign is posted by ordering station.  3.5 Stars

Ordering here is difficult because they give you the Americanized Chinese Menu if you are not Asian. We asked for the Chinese Menu and they looked at us funny. It turns out they have a mess of menus. They have many menus all over the room in Chinese, they have the Americanized Menu and they also have a very long Hong Kong Style Menu. I was told the Chinese Menus would not be the same next time because they change everyday.  When a waitress came back we asked her to translate the one Chinese Menu that was by our table. We decided to order from that menu. After that they were very nice to us and very helpful. She told us for future visits to just tell her what we like and she will suggest plates to us.  For my first plate here I went with Eggplant with tofu. It was unlike Asian Eggplant I had at other places. This dish was very light but still flavorful. Even the tofu was super light silken tofu with a nice thin crust. I was told it would be very spicy but it wasn't but still was very good with lots of good flavors in a thin light sauce.  The plate I'm really basing my five stars on is the dish that they call special beef. The vegetables in this dish were truly stunning. How often do you get fresh crisp lotus root in your dish. This dish also had the most unusual interesting mushrooms that had a texture unlike any other mushroom I ever tried. The other vegetables were all fresh and crisp. The beef in the dish was nice and tender like an eye roast but it was a very small amount of meat in the dish. This dish was very lightly sauced like the way you are suppose to sauce pasta. This dish was highly recommended by the waitress as she told us it was their best beef dish.  It should be noted that this place is not fancy and is located in an old strip mall prices are very low.

I really had the most unusual second experience here. The waitress's remembered us and the Chef ran out to take our order. He said he wanted to make us a special meal for us and said I remembered you like spicy. I said I'd like something with fish and vegetables. The waitress translated what I said to him and he ran to the kitchen.   Soon out comes these tasty silken tofu cubed bowls that were lightly battered holding these tiny shrimp with a tasty dipping sauce.  Next comes out this big bowl of hot and sour soup. The soup had lots of tofu threw it, pork and shrimp. Also some fresh made fried noodles that were very crisp and made with fresh clean oil. The soup was well made.  Then we get a big plate with Sea Bass and Bok Choy. The fish was very fresh tasting and moist. The bok Choy was crisp and tasty. The sauce was silky smooth made very carefully from stock with taste of garlic a spicy pepper and the perfect amount of salt.  Our two drinks and all this food only cost $26.00 before tip.  As I said in my previous review. If you aren't Asian they give you the Americanized Chinese Menu. I note they have a Hong Kong Menu and Many Menus written in Chinese all over the walls here that change Often.   I also note this isn't a fancy place.  I don't think you are going to find another place like this anywhere.  Update 5-30-15  As of April-2015 This restaurant was sold to new owners

Until early this year Lucky's King Wah Express was the very best Cantonese Restaurant in the Metro Phoenix Area. The restaurant has changed ownership twice since spring and the current owner serves up a more Americanized Menu and Chinese Food for patrons who can read Chinese.   Based on only one visit so far...The food is not the same. But what we had was pretty good and tasty.  I had the fish filets with Chinese Vegetables. I was pleasantly surprised that the fish used was flounder and thought that is much tastier than the normal tilapia or catfish that is often served in lower priced restaurants. Everything was prepared nicely and the dish was tasty but ran slightly salty for my taste.   My husband had the Hunan Beef. The beef was very tender and this dish was also tasty. It was very unlike anything we'd get here before. The sauce had some sweetness some smokiness to it and a very nice heat to it.   Service was friendly and attentive.   This isn't a fancy place and is located in an older strip mall but has comfortable big booths.  Seems like above average Chinese Food to me and does have potential  to be better than that if you can read Chinese.

This is possibly the most adorable looking restaurant in Glendale. You walk in to what looks like an antique shop with a grandma's dining room kind of look. They offer a large dog friendly patio and the Facebook page says to ask for the dog menu so I really wanted to love this place.   They started us off with fresh hot just baked mini muffins of two varieties one tasted like vanilla cake with chocolate chips the other was some sort of spiced muffin. They reminded me of box mixes.  My cajun chicken caesar salad arrives. The greens look fresh and crisp and the garlic parmesan breadstick looks like cheesy toast. I tasted the chicken and it taste very salty and over marinated like processed chicken from Costco. It might be the teriyaki flavor topped with too much salt. The taste of it made my stomach upset. The one thing I tried that was delicious was the crispy cheesy toast they gave me. They should feature that toast on the menu because it was unique and tasty. It was kind of like a crispy grilled cheese. I had to share it with my husband because there were some issues with his meal.  My husband had the breakfast special. It was missing the green onions and tomatoes that our waiter said would it would have. The eggs were fine but the pulled pork under the eggs lacked favors and the muffins underneath needed some toasting because they were very soggy. Lastly they forgot to fry the potatoes. It seemed like someone took a baked potato cut it up and just threw it in the oven. This made the potatoes very dry like chalk.   Sadly I have to kiss this place good bye!

I LOVE Tolmachoff Farms! the $2.00 a LB Heirloom Brandy-wine Tomatoes can't be beat and are the BEST! They are Dummy proof no matter how you prepare them you will have a hit on your hands. I love everything I buy from here, the only reason I didn't give five stars is because of the selection. For the most part you can only count on Tomatoes and squash but sometimes they have much more. They are WORTH the trip.  As a slight update, This time I noticed them selling Goat Milk and assorted Goat Cheese products from Crow's Dairy of Buckeye AZ.

This is a dive bar that serves up some above average food and some below average food. The atmosphere is dark with many stuffed hunted animals decorating the wall.   I tried the walleye pike. They coated the fish with a cornmeal kind of fish fry mix. Traditional coating for a sweet mild meaty walleye pike is a cracker crust or a beer batter so the corn meal was unexpected. Most of the fish was good but the ends were a little dry and chewy. Possibly from being microwaved or maybe from being freezer burnt. The kitchen is open so I did see the microwave oven getting a lot of use here. My platter also came with sweet but tasty cole slaw and shoe string fries that were very similar to Burger King kind of fries.  My husband had the French Dip. The beef was roasted in house and was very good but they served it topped with processed Swiss cheese and served it on a budget squishy soft roll.  It would take very little work for the food to be four stars here with some of the above average food they serve like buffalo burgers, walleye pike and the very good house roasted beef but the subpar bread, fries, processed cheese, cornmeal fry mix and heavy use of microwave cooking brings the level down.   Service was above average and was thoughtful and welcoming.  2.5 stars

This is a budget American Style cafe. I know what kind of food to expect and I certainly wasn't expecting Michelin Quality Cuisine.   I ordered the trout because the menu said it was fresh. I received mixed vegetables that were over boiled and soggy. Fish that was edible but over cooked, dry and seemed more like from frozen and not good. I also received GREY-GREEN mashed potatoes. Right away I asked the server why the potatoes were green. After asking the cook she said potatoes turn green from black pepper and potato skin.   This food was mostly inedible.   The server removed my plate with most of it remaining and didn't say a thing.

Once we figured how to enter threw the enclosed patio we made it to the hostess stand and got seated. The menu is all over the place meaning all kinds of styles of food are offered and they have multiple menus even at lunch time.   Overall I thought the Spa Menu Salmon Taco Plate was surprisingly good. Instead of a taco shell they thinly sliced fresh juicy jicama ! That's a great idea and it made the tacos very light and refreshing. I was so happy that the salmon tasted fresh and not fishy and was seasoned OK. The plate also came with grilled pineapple and grilled vegetables. The only thing I didn't like at all was the guacamole because it was dark and mushy with a weird thin texture and not such a good flavor. But it was only in a small amount of the taco so I could tolerate it. Overall it was a very nice plate anyway and I'd love to have it again when I'm up here on a hot sunny day.  My husband had the Enchiladas sampler plate with what they called green chile fideo. He liked his plate and said the enchiladas were tastier than he was expecting but the green chili fideo was OK but just seemed like spaghetti with a south west sauce on it instead of toasted pasta like it should be. But he was still overall happy with his meal.  Bigger hits than misses.  Worth a try!  3.5 stars.

My MAIN complaint about the Rio is the housekeeping service but did have some other issues.  YELP could NOT be accessed from my room and was blocked. The man at desk didn't know why Yelp didn't work from my room.  The drinking glasses had thick brownish goo around the rim and we marched them down to the desk to show the front desk and he gasped and then offered us free Internet to make us happy. (this was the first day and we thought about leaving)  The Bath tub was slippery and greasy with a slow drain.  Received an almost empty shampoo one day instead of a full one.  Received a crumbled towel on the corner with a big whole in it.  Another day had no maid service and called the front desk for towels THAT NEVER CAME!  The sofa in the room was all sunk in the middle.

Doesn't look like much from the outside but the rooms are great!  Great location!   They lie, internet doesn't work. You go to one page and you might as well leave and go out and have dinner and your next page still won't load.

Todai is an independently owned and operated somewhat upscale Seafood buffet in the miracle mile mall. They feature many Asian salads, a hand rolling corner, crepe corner, noodle corner, carving station and micro mini fancy desserts. The sushi is middle of the road sushi, not high end but good and rolled very small the way it should be. Everything I tried was fresh and had mackerel , tuna and salmon sushi.I liked the kimchi here, it wasn't too sour. They had another salad that looked like kimchi but was spicy napa cabbage that was slightly sweet. My favorite salad was the green tea chasoba. The tempura was fresh and light. Beer, wine and sake are available.  I would rate 4 stars for lunch during the week. (around $20)  The price is higher on the weekends and increases for dinner. (around $23 and $33) There is a coupon in the Vegas magazine for $5 off  For around $20 for lunch during the week in Vegas it's a pretty good lunch.

Wo Fat offers your usual Chinese Favorites and some Hawaiian Chinese Inspired Dishes that you won't find anywhere else nearby.   We started with the crispy au au chee (Crispy pork dumplings). They were very meaty and were fried to a bubbly light crisp.  I tried the cold ginger chicken in onion sauce. I was surprised that this dish was served warm and not cold. Once you peel off the chicken skin and remove it from the bone THIS IS KILLER GOOD CHICKEN! Deeply flavorful and moist. Not over seasoned the chicken flavor comes threw, just DELICIOUS. The portion they gave me was very large and I had enough leftover for two large dinners.  I wanted to try the hard to come by CAKE NOODLES. My server spoke English but I had a hard time understanding her and I accidentally ordered a meal of chicken cake noodles instead of just adding on cake noodles for $1.25. Anyway the cake noodles are really delicious. They remind me of ramen but are more firm and have much more flavor like wheat. The noodles seemed slightly pan fried with crisp ends and even were more delicious on the crispy ends. What ever kind of chicken dish she ordered for me was also delicious. It was chunks of flavorful tender yummy dark meat chicken.  My husband had Szechuan Shrimp. The shrimp were cooked well and this dish was FIERY HOT as it should be.  This is a small not fancy restaurant. Everyone there seemed friendly and welcoming. Our order was prepared quickly.

Los Sombreros offers much more on the menu than most Mexican Restaurants I've been too. They offer many plates with interesting ingredient combinations of all kinds and a wide selection of different proteins for dinner that includes different fish options.   I noticed a charge on the menu for chips and salsa but depending on what you order the fee is waved as we didn't ask for chips and salsa but they were given to us. I do note the chips were thin and hot and fresh and seemed free of grease. The one smooth tomato salsa was very hot and the other salsa was chunky and very smokey.  One of the MOST DELICIOUS THINGS I TRIED THIS YEAR was the Huitlacohe crepas from here.  For those who are unfamiliar with Huitiacohe it's considered to be a delicacy and grows on sick corn and is also called a Mexican Truffle. BUT I DO NOTE the crepes had so many flavors and textures in them I didn't recognize the Huitlacohe in them and I had Huitlacohe in Mexico a bunch of times and here in the valley a few times so I know what to look for. But the crepes were so delicious it doesn't matter to me. The lightly buttered thin perfect crepes with tasty fresh sweet corn, just the right amount of blue and goat cheese fot the right amount of tang and salt. Maybe the huitiacohe was part of the magic to the blend of flavors. Chewy cranberries and that drizzle of pomegranate sauce It was so good I will have a difficult time to come here and not order it again. Honestly I could enjoy this plate as a dessert because it did have some sweetness to it. I think it could be an EXCELLENT dessert plate.  I had trout like I never had it before. For one thing the portion was very large and I had to take half of it home. The fish was in a familiar lemon butter with capers sauce but it was topped with pickled cauliflower salad with almonds and caramelized onions. It was very unusual. I really enjoyed the side vegetables as they were so fresh and cooked but crispy and cut the right size for eating easily. The mixed vegetables had a surprise of crunchy chayote squash in them that livened them up. The side of rice was seasoned in a very tasty way too.  My companion had the Pork Chipotle and he said it was moist and very flavorful he enjoyed it very much.  I noticed they have a nice patio but in the 110 degree weather it's too hot to sit outside so we had to dine indoors. The inside is somewhat small and crammed. The few small normal tables were already occupied so we had to sit at a high top table. That really is the only thing I didn't care for since I'm only five foot zero i have to leap up and try to land on the sliding cushion and some how rock the chair to push it in.  Service was friendly , cheerful and efficient.

The Los Sombreros 10 Course Tasting Menu ($50. for TWO) is PHENOMENAL and is something you shouldn't miss out on if you are thinking of trying flavors of Central Mexico as the special will end sometime call or check website. I was told they are extending the special past August to promote the new menu and new restaurant they are opening.  You get. Chips and two Fresh Salsas.  Two cups Pozole Soup Two Hibiscus Taquitos Fig & Panela Cheese Salad Shrimp & Papaya Salad Salmon with Mango Salsa Trout with Almonds in Lemon Butter & Capers Chile Rellenos with Beef Picadillo Pechuga Rellena (Stuffed Chicken Breast in Chipotle Tomato Sauce) Pork Loin with Tamarind Mole House Made Piloncillo Ice Cream  Everything had delicious flavors.  I never had Hibiscus Taquitos before and they were a stand out. A little sweet and cheesy and tangy they were delicious.  The Chile Relleno stuffed with Beef were very unlike any other I had before being much lighter and MUCH tastier than any other I ever had. I liked that they weren't a fried battered kind like you get at most places and only had just the right touch of cheese on them.  The four entrees were all delicious but a few were over cooked but very ACCEPTABLE and that is the only reason I didn't up this place to five stars but I was five stars happy.  The house made Ice cream was very fresh tasting and the most creamy ice cream I remember trying in a while.  This place is far above average and is very good but it's a small place and many tables inside are high tops.    4.5 Stars

This resort does have appealing qualities. It's like you stay in a small apartment with a nice kitchen. I liked that you are in walking distance to the MGM and the free WIFI works really well.I also liked the very easy nice close parking.  The things I didn't like most.  Very high tub- I had to be very careful getting in and out of the shower.  Stains on carpet-big stains in entrance, a trail of stains through out. And most of all.........THE BED  The bed was very uncomfortable as it dipped in the middle. You could also feel hard springs on the ends. I didn't get one good night of sleep and woke up achy everyday. I stayed here once before and left to stay someplace else just because of the bed. That time the bed was even worse. This is years latter and I was told that they have gone threw remodeling and have made changes to improve and that is why we gave them another try.  I can never stay here again just because of the bed.

For the BEST in Ultra Fresh Seafood this is it. The Fish are line caught and flown in fresh everyday from Italy. Computer chips are inserted in fish to monitor the traveling temperature to insure perfection. A marine biologist is on staff to monitor the live tanks. You won't find that kind of care and quality anywhere else.  We tried a number of things since this was a splurge dining here. In general I found everything simplistic but done to perfection.  We were impressed with the priest chokers pasta, the texture was phenomenal. It wasn't fancy only butter and sage with pieces of turbot that melted in your mouth.  For dinner I wanted to try a fish I never had before. You get a whole fish that they sell by weight. The John Dory that they had last night was too big for two people so I picked the Gilthead Sea Bream with the tomatoes, arugula,garlic and red onion. The fish comes out on a cart, then the waiter cleans it and plates it with fresh vegetables and potato. The fish seemed slow cooked and really melted in your mouth. It was so light and fresh and the simple topping just enhanced the fish.  We had to try dessert and I don't get blown away by dessert often but the lemon cake is something YOU MUST TRY if you come here. It was just perfect, The perfect taste of lemon, it oozed lemon, it had crunch on the top and the rosemary gelato tasted so good with it.  Yes it's expensive. You get what you pay for.

This is the adorable looking patisserie shop in the Paris Casino on the strip. They offer amazing looking pastries, sandwiches, coffee and more. I walked by this shop a million times and finally decided to try out one treat the chocolate mousse pistachio dessert because it looked terrific.  My first bite was offensive in my mouth. The slick looking chocolate glaze is really loose brown colored gelatin that I had to scrape off. Then I took a bite of the almost dry mousse that was dense and too sweet without a good chocolate flavor. My last attempt at tasting something yummy was to try the pistachio ribbon. Sadly it seemed to be just green cream. I do think it's possible that this dessert was a few days old and might have been better when it was fresh.  Three small bites and this went in the trash.  Based on trying only one dessert I'd say the quality is equivalent to buffet desserts.

The Aria Location here is better than the other location because you can sit down here. I had the key lime one before and the last time it was mind-blowing and sent me in a tizzy with different layers of flavors including passion fruit. This key lime was different with only one layer of filling and didn't have the passionfruit layer or as much key lime and was good but not mind-blowing. My husband had deep chocolate one and it was Great. I didn't think the macaroon tasted right with it but it looked pretty. I would have given five stars if the key lime tasted the same as last time.   You will gain a pound from trying the treats here but it's worth it.

This Patisserie shop offers sandwiches, boxed lunches, tea cakes, pastries, chocolates, gelato and more. The executive chef is Jean Philippe Maurey who is an official Meilleur Ouvrier de France. That means best pastry chef in France. The chef also holds a world pastry team gold medal. There are two locations of this shop on the Las Vegas Strip. This is the bigger one with more seating in the Aria Hotel/Casino. This location has more products, more seating and always an amazing eye popping chocolate work display.  This year I tried a Lemon Meringue Tart. The crust was thin buttery and perfect and was topped thinly with a natural sweet tasting strawberry spread that was topped with the perfect tasting lemon filling. The filling had a delicious lemon pop, the right tang and sweetness. This dessert sported perfectly torched meringue and adorned with fine chocolate work. It sure doesn't get better than that.   It's also worth checking out the Bellagio location so you can see the world's biggest chocolate fountain.

The duck pond was my favorite part , but it is kind of dirty and lacking pond plants for the turtles that live there.  If you are shopping along this strip and need a break this will do because It IS NOT THE WORST but also NOT The best in American style Mexican cuisine.  We thought we were going to try the $14.95 buffet but took a peek and decided against it because nothing to use looked appetizing and there were very few choices I think only 6 buffet pans plus an omelet station .  They gave us the chips and the 3 sauces so MAYBE it's just me but all 3 sauces had an unusual ingredient added that I didn't care for .  My Chicken Fajita salad came and I DO NOTE this was the greasiest and oiliest one I have ever had it was very generous with peppers and onions and red cabbage that I picked out because dripping with oil . The chicken had an odd texture sort of dried out but juicy like a dry sponge with liquid . My salad also came with Mexican Style sour cream and  guacamole . I asked for the re fried beans on the side and my husband tried them he said they were just unseasoned whipped beans that really needed some salt .  My husband tried the carnitas and thought the actual pork was OK but the black beans that came with it just had an awful smoke flavor to them and he also wasn't a fan of the corn tortillas . He was having gastric problems the next day and thought it was from here since  I was fine and it was the only food we had different the day before . (so it seemed like kind of visiting Mexico for real) I can't say positively that this was from here just a guess .  If you dine here a table would be better than a booth because you will have a better view of the ducks , swans and turtles .

At first I was a little bummed when my husband picked the Residence Inn for our stay in Las Vegas but it turned out to be a very good stay for many reasons.   It was quiet at night so I could sleep and didn't hear the loud noises from the strip.  The bed was comfortable.  The shower was easy to work and didn't run out of hot water.  Very close, easy and abundant parking.  Walking distance to Monorail. (saves lots of $ on Taxis)  Free Breakfast. (They offer complimentary dinner Buffet Monday-Thursday)  The full size fridge was good for holding gallons of water.  Dog Friendly.  I do admit the decor isn't the most exciting but it seemed very clean so I wasn't afraid to sit on the furniture like I was at the Cosmopolitan where I thought I'd catch a disease or get pregnant from siting on the furniture.  The only downside I can think up at the moment was the free Wifi was slow in our room so we used a hot box.  It was a good stay I'd return!

We arrived four minutes early after a taxi ride for our reservation and made an early reservation because we had plans for seeing a show. We were made to feel very unwelcome so we opted not to return. The Bar was full of happy hour patrons and we were given the ultimatum to sit at the bar and buy some small plates or to leave and come back in four minutes. If the restaurant was closed at the time I'd understand but it wasn't and I had a reservation.The host knew we had a reservation and told us to leave.   We had a lovely meal somewhere else without having a reservation.  We were looking forward to dining at Fleur but will probably skip it next time too due to it's a big town with many options that are more welcoming.

Many Great Restaurants can be found in the area of Las Vegas and I have tried several and many were very good but I never before tried plates that delighted and surprised me so much before as I did here at L'Atelier. Everything we tried was well crafted and far from ordinary.  The Amuse Bouche of grapefruit and avocado was tongue thrilling.  A mini salad with fresh greens and caramelized Kampachi was interesting with texture and taste.  I wish I could have the cod I had here delivered to my door EVERYDAY the layered flavors and textures were magic in my mouth. Perfectly prepared cod cut in circle shape brushed with pesto topped with dill , tarragon , micro frisee sitting on top of moist and rich with butter potatoes in the lower half of the circle with a whispering spicy gingery design on the plate every thing went together like magic.  The BEST Dessert I ever had out in my life was the raspberry centered mini cheese and white chocolate covered sphere of happiness.  All this was only $59 portions were small but the right amount of food. (early dinner menu that changes)  Service was very cordial , sincere , and welcoming. The restaurant was cozy and spotless. The open kitchen was busy but also very quiet.  This was my favorite dinner I ever had in Las Vegas , it was so good we ate here twice and tried other things everything we enjoyed very much all top notch!

This is the place you go to when you want to EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED and want to taste things that you won't be able to duplicate. Overall it's a mix of taste textures and special ingredients you won't find anywhere else.  They were starting everyone off with an amuse of foie gras Parmesan parfaits.  I think it's best to order off one of the tasting menus of SMALL plates to get the whole experience. Currently they offer three tasting menus. I ordered off the smallest least expensive menu ($79) and I thought that was enough. I think the prices were something like $79. $109. and $159. My husband ordered al a carte.  I had a list of several appetizers to pick from. I picked the beef cheeks and it  really was the big surprise of the evening for me was how amazing the beef checks really were. The textures and taste are indescribable it was like eating air with amazing taste. The little salad next to it was also magical. We both were just blown away by this plate. My photo came out blurry but you can still see how meticulous the plate was put together. I watched the cook prepare it with tweezers.  Besides the beef cheeks I think my husbands favorite plate was the Le Jambon Ham. It's that special ham that comes from black footed pigs that only eat acorns. The ham has a special melting texture and slightly taste like acorns. You watch them slice it fresh and they serve it on a warmed plate.   The place is small and couples are only seated at the counter even with a reservation.

This SHOULD BE one of your Splurge Night destinations if you WANT to taste things that you won't be able to duplicate at home with unusual ingredients and the most interesting of textures. Everything I mean EVERYTHING we tried was a surprise and everything was masterfully crafted.  Like most of the other nicer Las Vegas Strip Restaurants they offer many menus and for price and selection I stick with the current $79. menu I think it's the most bang for your buck. It includes your amuse, two appetizers one entree and one dessert selection.  They started everyone off with an amuse of foie gras parmesan parfaits. My husband said they were indescribable.  One of the appetizers I revisited again was the beef cheeks. They have the smallest threads of radish standing up like hairs  applied with tweezers on the slowly red wine braised beef. decorated with the tiniest onion rings you ever seen in your life. this time micro cubes of tofu were applied. Last year they used chopped egg. What really amazed me was the gem lettuce I had it before but I never tasted lettuce that was so good before it was like the steak of lettuce. I don't know how you can make a lettuce so special but it was and it was adorned with the thinnest lightest cheese crisp anyone can imagine.  The salmon carpaccio was like melted butter in my mouth. The lemon laced fennel mango salad garnished with tiny purple flowers  and micro lettuce was perfect with it.  Seared Kampachi belly was butter like as well and worked well in the cilantro sauce as long as you didn't use too much of the sauce. Eggplant compote was complex with flavors.  The side of potatoes with almost just butter with some potatoes. It was so rich my heart almost stopped but I couldn't stop eating them. Only here have I tasted potatoes that were so smooth and so buttery like this.  I picked the tart for dessert and I received an assortment off the best appetizer sized tarts I ever had. Each one did differ in taste but each one was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  It was just light years from ordinary and among the very best I tried anywhere.

My Photos I just posted shows what shouldn't be done at ANY RESTAURANT ANYWHERE and there is no excuse for this to happen all night long at a Michelin Star Restaurant.  All night long the cook kept the cleaning towel under his armpit and was wiping the armpit rag all over everything the night I was here. I am FLABBERGASTED that the management or co-workers didn't notice these actions.  I am heart broken. I've dined at many fine restaurants and this was my favorite restaurant maybe in the whole country as I've been here several times.  No matter how Extraordinary the food was  (and it was) I have to knock out stars for that kitchen 101 mistake as that is unacceptable and can't go unnoticed.  And that my friends is the Forking Truth.

This is a one star Michelin Restaurant that serves up several tapas style tasting menus along with off the menu choices. The service is counter style where you watch the kitchen action.  For most of us this would be your splurge night. Expect the unexpected. Everything is a masterfully created surprise. All the food truly is as good as it gets and these are dishes that you'd never be able to duplicate at home.  They start everyone off with an amuse bouche, fresh baked breads and French butter. Everything I tried was very detailed, layered with many flavors and was just perfection. One of the small dishes that was very interesting was the L'Oeuf. I received a tiny soft fried quail egg topped with a nest of micro thin crisp noodles that sat over a detailed micro vegetable salad and house smoked salmon. Even the tiny greens seemed detailed like something was done to them.   Everyone gets the signature Joel Robuchon Pommes Puree. I heard that they are about 1/2 fingerling potato and half butter. They do taste like more than that. I imagine a touch of egg and possibly a tiny touch of dijon.   I always enjoy the Les Tartes. They are perfect little slices of heaven.  The food here is the best I ever had anywhere!  This IS GOOD AS IT GETS!

No it's NOT Pat's King of Steaks                                                             or                                                       Geno's                                                             or                                                     PUDGE'S                                                                      but it more like someone else in town.   Coreone's is a Genuine Taste of Philly as they make their Rib Eye Steak Sandwiches on Philly's Amoroso's Rolls. I didn't try the soft pretzels but I can tell you they sure LOOK like real Philly Pretzels you'd but off street corners. If your in the mood for dessert they also sell Philly's Famous TastyKakes that everyone knows. The casual place sure makes anyone from Philadelphia fell at home with that old Philadelphia look and all the really interesting iconic Philadelphia Memorabilia all around with a "Rocky Movie" playing on one of the TV's.   I tried a small steak combo. The small is plenty big and at least half the people out there only need a small. The ingredients are right so it passes as a Philly Steak Sandwich. Technically I'd like the sandwich tweaked a little different and the meat and onions less chopped up but it was still a good sandwich. I helped myself to the condiment bar and added HOT CHERRY PEPPERS and a few sweet cherry peppers and they were really good. For me it isn't a Philly Steak unless you have those delicious Cherry Peppers on it.    I wasn't a big fan of the onion rings but the fries were good.  My husband had the regular size combo. He ate many more cheese steaks in Philly than I did. He thought it was the best Cheese Steak he had in Arizona so far. I thought the regular size one was enormous and can feed two people. I asked my husband if he would get a small size next time and he said NO WAY.   They offer other menu items like Philly Style Pizza (I might try next time and tell you if it is)  Chicken Steaks and Hoagies.  For me this really was a  fun "TASTE of Philadelphia" and I didn't have to drive down the Schuylkill to get there.

Squish squish so you can Eat a Dish. How Crazy is that? They even provide wax paper just for squishing down your food to CRUSH as much as you can into the tiny dish.  I was a first timer and didn't know the squish thing or even had an idea what the wax paper was for until I saw OTHER PEOPLE displaying humiliating , embarrassing ,  disgraceful behavior crushing down food and then piling maybe as high as 10 inches above the bowl. Some people actually had to jump in the air to squish. ( I am sorry now I didn't video and send this up to You Tube.)  The meats and vegetables seemed fresh and I didn't notice any vegetables being canned (like at the Gag Us Chain) But I really didn't like the watered down sauces. Unlike the other stir fry places here you need to add maybe 7 ladle's of sauces to get the correct flavor and then you get a BOILED vegetable dish. YUCK!  I know MOST people enjoy coming here and doing the squish thing eating a boiled dish of food for approx. $10 but I can go to my favorite Chinese and get a rice bowl that taste better and is bigger and not crushed food for only $3.50 or spring for the whole lunch plate for only $4.95 so you won't be seeing me here again.  As for Stir Fry Places I like the independent Stir Fry place on Bell Rd is better than this place or the Gag Us Chain because I don't have to squish down food , I (don't) but I can go back and get as many Stir Fry's as I like at that place and the sauces aren't watered down so the food comes out better.   To each his own . Different Stir Fry's for different folks Eat what YOU like!

This Vietnamese Restaurant is located in Old Town Glendale with all the cute shops. The atmosphere is really charming because this restaurant is a very old tiny cute converted house. This time I ordered the large chicken salad. I received a really big mound of fresh crispy cabbage mixed with light as air iceberg lettuce. My salad was laced with fresh herbs and white meat chicken and a fresh light limey dressing. It's a perfect meal for when your running around and it's hot outside. I thought the small salad would be too small but the large is more than I can eat. So small salad and and an appetizer or dessert is the way to go.  My husband had a pork and rice plate. It was very good and came with a fried egg and a crispy pork filled roll.   I wanted to try a macaron but our server got busy and slapped our check on the table while we were eating.   So we paid and left.

Egg-Zactly what you want in a breakfast place only 2 miles off the strip.  We got drawn in by the great reviews and the buy one get one free coupon in the current Las Vegas coupon booklets that are in every taxi everywhere so we whipped on over .  What SEPARATES the eggs here from other breakfast joints is the foods we tried were prepared with care and were NOT GREASY , YEAH success! and they offer many things that surprise you that are different that you won't see anyplace else also VERY REASONABLY PRICED .  No yoke we had the chile Relleno omelet  (a whole green chili stuffed with cheese inside your omelet covered with sauce and cheese) and the chorizo skillet eggs  , both were enough for two people each and both were tasty delish! I picked the house made banana muffin over the toast and it was a really GOOD real banana muffin not a mix .  This place cracks me up , they are GOOD eggs!

According to Tripadvisor Bobby Q is the Highest Rated BBQ in Arizona. Bobby Q is a very large old fashioned looking restaurant. I don't know how old it is but to me it looks a hundred years old with Giant Old Trees shading the parking lot. As you walk in you do get hit with an aromatic BBQ aroma.   We were quickly seated and our server gave us a fast run down on Bobby Q. We learned that everything is made in house and the meats are smoked with mesquite wood. They also start everybody out with what I recognize as Johnny Cakes with soft whipped butter.  I had the BBQ Pulled Chicken Sandwich with Pecan Cole Slaw. The Chicken was falling apart tender and laced with sweetness but not too much. A small amount of skinny fried onions were added to my sandwich on a soft grilled roll. The coleslaw was drip free and fresh and crunchy.  My husband had a much better value item called the lunch sampler plate with 3 meats and a side. He enjoyed everything. I tried a taste of the brisket and for me it was too succulent and fatty but for my husband who likes fat he thought it was just right. My husband ate the macaroni and cheese I have to say it tasted like processed cheese. I didn't like the macaroni and cheese but I know most people do like this style. My husband liked the beans too he said they were packed with all kinds of meat ends.  When you're all done they present you with a bag of Fresh Made Thank "Q" Cinnamon  Sugar Donuts.  Not my stye of BBQ but I still thought it was good and plan to return for dinner.

The $1.25 breakfast seemed appealing to my husband and he wanted to try it. I saw these cute looking Swedish desserts made with marzipan so I was curious about them so I picked one up. It is a cafeteria and you go threw a line just like you did at school. I didn't try any of the breakfast plate but to my eye the eggs seemed to have been cooked in a large batch in a steamer. The turkey sausage and potatoes didn't appear to be a fresh kind and had that certain frozen look to them like what you can find in your grocers freezer. You can see in my photo they look very processed.  I go to try the little cake and have a taste of the frosting. Wow! it was terribly sweet and have a texture that was like liquid rubber with an awful after taste. So I peal some off and go for the inside. The cake tasted like something processed and a chemical fake raspberry taste was above it. I fear it had it had castoreum in it. If you don't know what castoreum is you possibly don't want to know what it is but you HAVE eaten some if you ever ate a Cadbury Cream Egg.  A few things did look better than the breakfast like the tomato and cheese salad and the gravlax plates.   If you are a fan of the meatballs you can buy them in the store in the frozen section.  I think most people have had food outside the box and have had better.  1.5 Stars

Since my last review the menu has changed a few times for the better. Also since my last review I've dined at several Italian Restaurants in the Scottsdale area that offer similar meals at much higher prices that aren't as good so I feel the need to update my review.  This is a family owned and operated budget Italian Restaurant that's been a pillar of the area for over twenty years. Nothing comes pre-made all the food and sauces are prepared in-house. Portions are large and prices are low. No other restaurant that I know of offers around a half dozen fresh vegetable choices for your dinner nightly. If your not a fan of pasta you can alter your dish to be prepared with spaghetti squash instead. Although the restaurant isn't gluten free they do offer gluten free pasta and whole wheat pasta for those who are interested. Another health helpful option is the grilled chicken parmesan that you can get over vegetables if you care too.  I had one of the new dinners Steak Gorgonzola where I swapped out the pasta for spaghetti squash ($13.99). This dish was richly flavored and delicious. The steak was seasoned and was butter knife tender. The sauce was delicious and flavorful. The dish was made with fresh spinach and sundries tomatoes and gorgonzola cheese.   I'm a big fan of the spacious comfortable dog friendly patio and enjoy the live music that plays on the weekend. I've always found the service friendly and warm and efficient.  Tag's offers DEEP discounts. You can get $25 extra on a $100. gift card purchase and they also have a Swipe Card that gives you additional savings.  This is a family friendly kind of restaurant.

VERY very Very GOOD! I have to teeter totter between four and five stars.  When I tasted the dinner roll I knew this place wasn't average. I never tasted a roll like this before. It almost tasted like it was made with white corn flour but it wasn't. The roll was Yucca flour and cheese and was gluten free.  The menu is difficult to read.   We ordered the Kampachi En Leche De Tigre. Our waiter translated it as Kampachi two ways. It was the most generous portion of Kampachi I ever had anywhere and both kinds were delicious. One was mild and the other was sort of creamy spicy and cut with avocados. The presentation was outstanding. ($16.)  My husband ordered the Bone-In Pork Chleta, it was described on the menu as Niman Ranch Pork Loin Spanish Chorizo, Kale and Peruvian Giant White Beans ($28.)   I note it is our fault for not revealing an allergy but there is no mention of lots of pineapple in this dish and my husband has a pineapple allergy. He receives his plate and looks at all the chunks of pineapple on top of the pork and shoves it aside and takes a bite of the pork and says IT'S DELICIOUS but then starts to get an itchy throat. He stops and ask the Chef in the open kitchen about the Pork and we find out the pork is also marinated in pineapple.   LICKITY SPLIT the CHEF takes BOTH our plates and makes us new ones right away! The Chef suggest the Beef Tenderloin for my husband and he soon received that!  I Received a new Pan-Seared Halibut. The fish was cooked perfect and seemed like oil poached. The Fideo was loaded with lots of fresh vegetables and was flavorful and very good. I remember reading something about cauliflower and spinach with this dish and they arrived as pretty sauces on the plate that individually tasted very different. ($32.) The green sauce was kind of sweet and the yellowish sauce was savory.  We shared a side order of Red Lentils with Mustard Greens. ($8.) They were the most delicious Lentils I ever had! They were made with toasted Marcona Almonds, Local Dates, and Mahon cheese. All these flavors together was amazing.  The Beef Tenderloin was all you want it to be. It melted in the mouth and was very flavorful. Everything on that plate was Delicious.  We were too full for dessert.  Deseo participates with LocalDines.Com. I didn't have any trouble using my local dines here and saved approximately $30.00 of my check.  I'm still teeter Toddling between 4 and 5 stars. The food is five stars or close to five. I think the menu should be more descriptive or the server should explain the dishes. All through the meal many different people served us and in the end things turned out fine but the service from the wait staff just doesn't feel like five star service to me and I'm not certain if my server even knew we had a problem during our stay. I don't know if my experience is typical or my waiter might have been new or just seemed loaded with too many tables. He was very good answering our questions in the beginning of our stay but we didn't see much of him until he said something like "Are you going to be having dessert?" A professional server would say something like, "We have many delicious desserts and my favorite one is.....or our most popular one is.....Food wise was excellent and the Chef went  above his duties and out of his way to take care of us. Servicer wise it felt more like a Macaroni Grill instead of a Binkley's. Not bad but not as high end as the food.  4.5 Stars

The Ambiance is so breathtaking it almost doesn't matter what the food or service is like so that makes Sassi is a must go to dining destination if you enjoy going out to eat .  You will want to dine on the patio so make sure you reserve a table there .  Because of the Elegant , Romantic but Casual atmosphere I almost didn't mind the white dinner napkin when I was wearing black .  We started with an Antipasti plate and seasonal Melone (honeydew) both were Fantastic . The small size Antipasti that we shared was larger than we thought it would be with higher quality meats and cheeses than i thought it would be. I did  think the small is big enough for 4 people . The Melone we had Blew me away and this became an instant must order again  I hope it can taste this good again it was so light and refreshing it was divine seasoned just right.  My husband had the house made Orecchiette with house made sausage , red peppers , rapini and pecorino he enjoyed it.  I had the special salmon but not the May special I ordered it as an entree (wild king salmon ,squash cut like fettuccine , fava beans and pistachio mint pesto) It was very good but not perfect ,the pesto needed more mint , slightly over salted and slightly underdone and was slightly too oily, I do understand medium rare but mine was rare to raw on half I was undecided about sending it back but I didn't because nobody checked on us and I was getting filled up anyway and had enough food. You will not be as picky as me and will not think the same because it was so fresh and really good quality salmon it almost didn't matter.and it was good don't get me wrong and I would have given 5 stars if my meal was spot on and service perfect.  Overall it was enjoyable I thought reasonably priced I would recommend and I'd return. I thought the server I had was not as accommodating as others I saw . this was close to a five .

As I said before the atmosphere here is so breathtaking the rest almost doesn't matter and they also have one of the best patios anywhere for outside dining .  The bread basket is excellent with variety and you have high quality olive oil to use .  We ordered the antipasto again and now I believe my server LAST TIME gave us the wrong one ( the one for four people last time) because this one was much smaller and maybe less variety BUT STILL GOOD and ENOUGH .  Both dinners were cooked to perfection , we had Veal Osso Buco over polenta and very light and delicious Branzino that came with roasted broccoli and a roasted lemon . The broccoli was a whole top that was roasted and had crisp ends but not burnt , sort of nutty tasting it was the very best broccoli I ever had out .   Service was off the charts as good as can be and like last time they called the next day to discuss how they did .  They participate in the preferred restaurants card program and one dinner was free . They did add 20% gratuity because of the preferred card but I had no problem with that since everything was excellent .   Everything really was great I highly recommend .

Got the impression Corbin's seems to not fear to season their food nicely.  The onion rings are tasty and large, the dip is a little too smokey for my taste but isn't really needed anyway.  The Thai lunch salad was very fresh with deseeded cucumbers. I liked that it wasn't necessary to use a knife , everything was a perfect size. A few too many fried noodles were used for my taste but the salad over all was very good and also presented well.  The green chili pork stew was also carefully made and seasoned well.  Many interesting menu choices here at reasonable prices.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Restaurant appeared to be very clean.

I've been here several times and no other restaurant that I have been to in the Phoenix Area has delighted , thrilled and surprised me as much as Quiessence . Each time I've been here we've had different plates that were never the same but always excellent , and I always have something new I never had before and I find that exciting !  I recommend you to indulge to select the farmers feast so you get a sampling of much of the days menu that is customized to your liking or needs , also I find it cost less that way also because you are getting 6 COURSES !  I started with house pickled and marinated seasonal vegetables with a few cheeses what stood out to me as different was the flavors were Bold but not too much and the salads were very neat and not oily one bit . My husband was served a plate of house made salumi cheeses and a very interesting strawberry wrapped in larding that he said was like butter on a strawberry he also said the house made meats were better than from a special place  we went to in Las Vegas .  Second plates were smoked black cod & cucumber salad and also arugula , long beans , pancetta , & duck egg salad . Again both salads were very neat not oily but flavorful .  Third plates were house made gnocchetti with peaches and another pasta tortellini with pepperonata , raisins , pine nuts and eggplant . Both were very good but the tortellini was a high point .  Fourth courses were Tuna with eggplant , tomato topped with sea beans (very hard to find here I have purchased them before as sea asparagus ) with arugula . This was the most delicious Tuna I ever had .  Fifth Plates were Venison with an Antelope terrine with wild huckleberries , and a Beef tenderloin with tiny carrot coins and a tiny baked buttered potato . I note that this Beef was the BEST I ever had anywhere .  We shared a plate of assorted mini desserts including something lemon , chocolate , strawberry but the most interesting and exciting one was the Fig Pot de Creme with chocolate shell topped with Candied ROSEMARY topped with a very thin abstract hazelnut cookie standing up . I never knew something like that could taste so good .   I've been to other places in the Phoenix Area that were this price range but this is the only one that I enjoyed this much . (so far)  Every visit here has never disappointed me and service has always been outstanding  UPDATE 11-17-13  Since my review the ownership and Chefs have changed .

This was decent food if you know how to order and very low priced if you understand how to order.  The foods are in generous double portions. We had two chicken dinners and could only eat maybe half because they give you half a chicken (cacc. and the chicken with hot , sweet sausages and hot cherry and bell peppers ) Both dinners came with TONS on vegetables . The bread basket was massive and very good . We also shared the arugula salad that was also for sharing . We didn't have the famous meatballs but I over heard they are 6oz. each.  The quality is like Aunt-made , maybe not from your home but decent and good. I don't know if everything is as good as the chicken since we both had chicken but it was moist and flavorful on the bone with skin , so that might not appeal to some people .  Next time we are sharing one dinner or will stay in a room with a microwave so we can take back leftovers.  Maybe you want food other than hoydy toydi chef places , this is it.

Ive been here twice and THIS IS THE BEST GELATO I've ever tried. I recommend to split your cup with two flavors so you can try more than one. This time I had the rum with nuts and the hot chili chocolate. If you are sad you will feel happy afterwards. If you are old you will feel young. If you are poor you will feel rich. It is just that GREAT! I don't have words to tell you how amazing it was but I felt like I needed a cigarette afterwards and I don't smoke. BTW the pistachio is just as good too!  Just amazing, it's just the best!   This is a MUST TRY.   GO HERE!  They also make some Italian Sandwiches ,  these teeny weeny delicate tiny fruit tarts that look like they belong in a doll house , Other assorted pastries and they carry some Italian Candies.

Binkley's is an experience that can't be compared to any other and certainly is memorable. You pick your courses and receive them coupled with a parade of maybe a dozen tasting plates that includes a combination of traditional foods and molecular gastronomy. I feel we got the most satisfaction because we choose to get the wine paring and I feel food and wine pared takes food to a much higher level.  The cold appetizers were picture perfect you could snap a picture and have artwork for your house but the hot appetizers are really something to rave about. Both were great but I think the one that might be the most memorable was the SHAVED BLACK TRUFFLES on a perfect soft farm egg on some sort of fresh grilled bread with mornay sauce. This one dish was exceptional and the next day me and my husband were craving it.  Somewhere in-between appetizers and dinner we enjoyed a variety of cheese and fondue.  For the dinners we picked Wild Striped Bass , Chicken , and Ribeye. We both thought the Chicken was the stand out dish and was roasted in way that tasted different from any other roasted chicken we ever tasted . We were also told the chicken can from just right up the street and was alive yesterday . Our second favorite was the striped bass that was cooked and seasoned to perfection followed by the Rib Eye . The Rib Eye was good but wasn't a stand out like the Chicken.  Dessert was interesting, we shared the raspberries and they came out with liquid nitrogen and froze the sauce with a big puff. I have to admit I was slightly scared I would get splashed but I didn't. This plate was fancy embellished with micro sized blondie bars and had the raspberries stuffed with a little bit of cream and had creamy drops of that nitrogen ice cream also nuts and very tasty frozen citrus pieces.  SOME only some not all of the small tastings were- Yu Shu Flowers that you brushed threw oil and a seasoning. Savory Donut Squash/Apple Soup Frozen Citrus Salad Wine Braised Currents vanilla Couscous Beef Jerky horseradish foam perfect chervil lardon egg in a micro tiny thimbal shaped puff pastry Apple Bomb looked like raw egg yolks but was molecular gastronomy Key Lime Lollipop Cinnamon Souffle Some I liked more than others only a few were misses for me but all were very interesting.  The Dinner for us was three hours, the staff was very orchestrated well timed and extremely professional. Binkey's called us the next day to thank us for coming.

Like I said before Binkley's is an exsperience that can't be compared to any other and is certainly memorable. You just don't go here on a whim as it is a special destination kind of place. You go here to celebrate something and spend about twice as you would for a regular nice dinner out. The seats here are NOT created equal as you might get a little squashed in table nested by a busy waiter's stand or a spacey roomy semi private table pushed away from all the action. You don't go out to eat here, you go here to dine and your stay will last two and a half to maybe three hours. Binkley's doesn't have the finest atmosphere as it is a small restaurant located in a small strip mall but the exsperience here is special and the food is in general unexpected, playful and presented in magnificent ways. Some dishes involve molecular gastronomy and are presented like a science experiment.  You have a choice of different ways to order either a la carte, multiple tasting menus and wine options that are paired expertly and not average.  Binkley's is well known for enhancing your meal with many Amuse Bouche and when I say many it really is over a dozen and maybe around twenty different ones. That are micro sized and look like they belong in doll houses. One plate was playing card sized and had a sloppy joe the size of a short fingernail with a waffled fan potato chip standing up on the plate. (sadly this photo was one of many that didn't come out)   I enjoyed everything but some dishes stood out more than others for me.  A dish that packed a big wallop of flavors was the Australian Black Truffle and Sweet Corn Risotto. I'm a sucker for real truffles and these were fresh and not dried up like from other places I had truffled dishes. The plate was a wonderful flavor and texture combination that surely was a pleaser.  It might not be for everyone but I enjoyed the Seared Hamachi Au Poivre. It was a little spicy from the seven peppers and sort of melted in the mouth. It almost was like a really good steak but lighter. This plate also visually interesting and had many textures. This is a new dish for them.  The staff was very well orchestrated and extremely professional.

My review will be most helpful to people who have visited Binkley's before and might confuse those who never dined here.  Binkley's is considered to be one of Arizona's finest restaurants. The Chef is a four time James  Beard nominated chef. The cuisine is French Inspired mixed with whimsey using the highest quality ingredients out there.  This restaurant is located in a strip mall and isn't the fanciest inside.  It is common knowledge that the Chef/Owner is closing this restaurant at the end of June and is focusing on opening a new concept in the fall at his (at this time) the  more casual Mid Town Bink's Restaurant that will be closed and remodeled for the changes.  Binkley's used to offer their guest many menu choices so that they could customize their menu into four, five or six course tasting menus or have the option of ordering ala carte. You used to about three different choices for each selection.  The menu choices have been downsized. The current offerings are either a petite tasting menu already made up for you or the chef's menu that is also already written and a Chef's Tasting menu that is already written. On line are vegetarian menus that I didn't receive in the restaurant. Substitution off the Petite Menu or Chef's Menu converts to a vegetarian plate.  Some of the other changes I noticed are choices in the wine parings. You pick them by your budget now and the new wine pairings are in three levels that range around $50-$200+ a person. Other changes are that you don't get the assortment of bread anymore, you get less but some better amuse bouche, the cheese menu has been dropped and you don't pick your dessert or cheese course anymore.  Technically most of the food I had was prepared perfect. The only exception was my second course that had shiitake mushrooms that were razor thin and leathery hard.   Both me and my husband loved the risotto (our 3rd course) and it was both our favorite course of the evening. The rice was a perfect al dente and the sauce was rice and creamy. the Parmesan Foam just added that perfect umami. It was delicious and one of two plates I would want to have again.  My favorite amuse bouche was the fresh shaved French Truffles over house made mascarpone cheese with local honey. This was more satisfying and much more wow factor than some of the entrees.  If I am honest and if you read my reviews you know I always am I have to admit I was very underwhelmed with my dinner of Steelhead Trout. It was prepared to perfection but was far less detailed to what I tried before at Binkley's for dinner. I thought my dinner was also sort of spoiled because someone accidentally served me cabernet wine that didn't pair at all fine with this dish. In addition to that nobody cleared the last amuse bouche plates or the last wine glasses and just dropped the dinners off. I had a pile of extra serving ware on the table to look at. (see dinner photo). I did inform the sommelier that the cabernet didn't pair with my dinner and he apologized and poured me more cabernet and said he'd give me an extra wine course with dessert.  They preformed molecular gastronomy on dessert and it was to close to me and I felt it on my leg. It didn't burn but it felt like ice cubes rubbing on my leg. It was weird.  Lastly someone used to stand at the hostess stand and thank us for coming. When we left nobody was there but someone did run after us in the parking lot and asked us if we took our parting snack bag.  Binkley's is still one of the finest places to dine at in Arizona but if you've been here before it's no longer the same.

This is a family owned Chipotle like kind of place adorned with  Whimsical Disneyish  boarder line offensive Stereotype Mexican Caricature Paintings. Your food is served to you in aluminum cake pans. (that might be a sign to run away) and they ring a cow bell when you tip them. (maybe another sign of I got another sucker today and this one going to die when they try this food)  I've been here before and thought I remembered it being better and maybe I was just here on a off day on my most recent visit. My expectations weren't high I knew where I was I was just expecting quick and OK.  I am giving two stars based on my husband's meal of two enchiladas that he said wasn't the best but edible and cheap.  I liked the fresh greens in my salad and I really liked the fresh cabbage option for the salad but I didn't like my Chicken Green Chile Salad for many reasons. So I have to think do I just don't like it because of my taste or is this a meal that IS awful? My conclusion is that it was awful.  1) The Chicken tasted like CANDIED Chicken. It's a shame because the chicken seemed fresh and was cooked nice and seemed like it could have been good in other hands. (even a caveman can do better)  I didn't know you could make chicken that sweet. They took the time to marinate the chicken with honey and poured a ton of honey on top of it.  2) The what seemed like house made dressing was awful and I don't know what it was suppose to be. It could be used as a WD40 substitute. I took a small taste and pushed it away before it caused damage in my system.  3) The pasteurized guacamole like green stuff just doesn't taste good. It's manufactured mix of chemicals that Lowe's maybe uses in their paint.  4) The salsa tasted like those budget jarred salsa that always suck. Nothing fresh and not so good tasting. Very flat and soggy.  5) They gave me a fresh made flour tortilla that was RAW!  6) Where was the Green Chile? Nothing resembled green chile in my salad but I did have fried onions and I did have fresh greens in a tin! WOO HOO!  ADIOS Bajio!  1.5 Stars

Spinato's is a locally owned family ran pizza/restaurant chain. You can do take out service or you can get seated in the cozy dining room or patio. This location gets very busy around happy hour time and might be on a wait during all of happy hour.  The people we with highly recommended getting the Spinach Calzone with added Ricotta Cheese. We ordered and it took a very long time for the Calzones to come out of the kitchen but once they arrived our server was very attentive and brought us sauce with the calzones.  If you are very critical with your tasting you will notice that the sauce is very sweet and also very salty. If you are a normal taster and taste the sauce on the calzone you will see it as wildly flavorful.  I liked that the calzones had a thin crisp dough. The calzones were also very heavy with garlic and stuffed with lots of melty cheese and lots of fresh baby spinach. Overall it was tasty and service was good.   Prices are low and the food is very filling.  You'll leave stuffed like a calzone.  3.5 stars rounded up because for Phoenix Standards I feel the food I tasted and atmosphere seemed above what the average neighborhood pizza joint offers.

The atmosphere is lots of fun but the food is another story.  With a 3 star average on Yelp I wasn't expecting the best but was aiming for ok food. I was here many years back and the food was awful then but I heard about new ownership so I thought this place might be worth a try.  You walk in and see maybe a thousand model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. Then you pass by a retro salad bar similar to the ones from those budget steakhouses. They have a case packed with nice looking desserts. The back wall has large windows so you can watch the airplanes take off and land.  I ordered the grilled flat iron steak. My dinner came with a loaf of soft wheat bread and salad bar. The salad bar had lots of items that were fresh. Nothing I picked was bad or bad tasting. I was happy enough with the salad bar.  My Grilled Flat Iron Steak arrives and looks pretty good. But I had a hard time sawing through it with my steak knife and really needed something stronger like a jack hammer. Thank God I still have my real teeth because if I had dentures they'd be in the trash from damage occurred from trying to chew through that meat.  Thank GOD I asked for the gravy to be served on the side because it was THICK and LUMPY like RICE PUDDING. The gravy was so unappetizing looking I had to push it away from me because it looked like vomit to me.   I do note the mashed potatoes and bell peppers were both good and that was a surprise. At least I had something to eat.  My husband had the chicken fried steak. He was able to eat his but complained to me about the thick lumpy gravy and corn that seemed like from frozen.  Our waiter never checked on us.  I was thinking about dessert because they did actually look good.  The waiter just dropped off the bill.  We paid and at that point the manager asked us how everything was and I didn't feel like getting into it at that point so I just said ok.  I might give them another try in the future because of the location and fun atmosphere but not any time soon.

Today's Asian Pear salad had apples in it instead of pears with nobody telling you that. See my picture and you can guess how it taste.  Maybe the best meal they make is the Tofu Puffs,Todays vegetables were Broccoli, Bok Choy, Snow Peas, Carrots, and Mushrooms in an Ultra Mild thickened Chicken Broth. I couldn't taste any oil in this dish or much flavor but it did seem like fresh food.  I have been here many times with different diners because of location and I remember one person not liking a shrimp dish and another not liking a beef dish. I thought the Asian Pear Salad was a total loser today.  Most of the Asian restaurants in this immediate area are two stars to me  with them all being different also I wanted to retry in this area and also I didn't care to drive down Bell Road for a better option.  The thing that separates this two star Chinese from others nearby is that this place is sparkling clean,just look at the grout by the door.

I took my instrument here for a repair. I was told I'd get the estimate the next day but got it in two days. That's not a biggy and I'm AOK with that. I didn't ask enough questions and found out they don't do the repair and sent it out to someone else to repair. They had my instrument for 21 days. In that time I found out I could just send my instrument out for repair myself and the prices vary from $70-$140. (plus shipping) They charged me $225.00   I also use reeds and they sell the Ricco Reserve Reeds for $29.00 and that is fair but I found them myself on the internet for only $17.95 including shipping.   They also don't carry my Eb reeds but they can order them. I told them not to bother I just ordered them myself.   I saw they have many rooms with people practicing and it was terribly noisy the rooms don't seem soundproofed and it wasn't music to my ears.  A little beat here or maybe it blows?

Short Story- Very Rough Gem                   - Above average Chinese Food - Americanized                    - Specialty might be Cantonese Style Seafood + Live Seafood                   - Service is efficient but not warm or friendly                   - Appears a little tired or run down but scores "A" with Health Inspection  Long Story-  Once seated I saw the tanks of live seafood and saw a sign for sea bass that I was interested in. The waitress told me that they are all out of sea bass and haven't had it for at least three days....This was not a deal breaker for me but my husband got offended by the way she said it like I should have known they were out of sea bass. She said today they have tilapia. I'm not a big fan of tilapia so I ordered off the menu.  I got the rock cod with vegetables. The Fish was prepared to perfection and was very moist and clean tasting. The sauce was very thin, light and velvety with essence of chicken and was laced with ginger and garlic. This would have been a perfect dish if the bok choy was cleaned properly. I also note the paddle in my rice bowl appeared dirty but when doing a closer inspection I realized the paddle is stained not dirty. This can be easily fixed by using bleach.  My husband had the Szechwan Pork. He thought it was very above average. The pork was moist. The dish was spicy and wasn't too sweet like the way Americanized Chinese Szechwan is. It wasn't the same as the way The Szechwan Restaurant Mui's used to make it but still this dish was very good.  The Yelp rating is very accurate here.  I'm also feeling a 3.5 based on service, atmosphere and averaging food in.  I will round up my rating to 4 stars because the food is what this thing is about.

This review is only based on take out pizza.   NYPD Pizza is a local pizza chain with twelve individually owned locations in the valley. They offer New York Style Pizza made with genuine New York Water.  We took out two pizzas and found some difference between the personal size and the small size. Our personal size pizza was tasty but had a much thicker dough ratio to toppings than the small size.  Both of us were most found of the small size "Blanca" (white pizza that was 1/2 tomatoes and half spinach) While the pizza didn't remind me of a genuine New York Slice it was a very tasty unique pizza. The crust was thin and chewy and very light. The toppings were delicious and  extra seasoning wasn't needed. The spinach was actually fresh spinach and you could tell it wasn't from frozen. The pizza was so light I could eat three slices without that over filled feeling that I get from some other pizzas.  The pizzas we tried were hot, fresh and tasty.  I'd recommend the small size over the personal size because of the topping to dough ratio.

This place IS really GREAT except for one thing that some people like. THE NOISE! We almost left, it was so noisy we couldn't have a conversation and neither of us could hear the drink special from our waitress. The noise level did get better towards the middle of our stay I guess if you are there during the happy hour you might hit them when they are busy and noisy.  However  The food was good, I started with a little romaine salad it was only $3. it was good except for the apple slices that tasted like onions (that might mean something wasn't cleaned). My roasted salmon was delicious and came over a cold quinoa salad. I was surprised to find out they use high quality Scottish Salmon that only better restaurants use.   My companion had the cheese flat bread and the Pork Chile Verde and was pleased.  We spent much less here on dinner than we would have spent at many other places having a similar meal.  I do plan to return but will wait for a patio seat where dining is much more pleasant.

I've only heard positive things about the Chef of Jennifer's. She is a well trained chef and has worked in many very prestigious restaurants.   I came here for restaurant week and whoever prepared the food clearly wasn't Jennifer.  The best dish of the six we tried was the soup and sammich appetizer. The soup had little taste and seemed like half and half with pureed squash that was decorated nicely. The sandwich was tasty Grilled Brioche Bread that was stuffed with quality cheese, local honey and fresh pears. My husband had Arborio Rice that was still hard and not very creamy or tasty it was very flat and dry.  My second Course was Patagonia Salmon over a  Sunchoke Puree  that was getting broken up by a big puddle of oil. The Fish was topped with not so tasty combination of raw tomatoes, and brown chunks of garlic and some fresh basil. The Fish was edible.   My husband's Fresh Pasta Dish seemed like boxed spaghetti  instead of fresh pasta that was prepared mushy and seemed sort of watery.  At this point we were checked on and my husband informed the waiter about Hard Arborio Rice and Mushy Pasta. The waiter seemed sorry about that and walked away.  I was hoping that desserts would be redeeming but for me they were the worst part of the meal.  My favorite dessert is Lemon Meringue Pie so I was hoping the Mason Jar Lemon Meringue would be delicious. The Meringue wasn't Meringue but tasted like that gooey jarred Marshmallow Stuff called "Fluff" It was terrible to me. Nobody goes out for dinner and expects to receive  jarred "Fluff".My husband was hoping for an apple Tarte Tatin. You can tell by the photo he didn't receive a Tarte Tatin. I didn't taste his dessert because I was too grossed out by the Marshmallow Fluff I just had but he said the dough was really weird.   Maybe this is a really good sandwich place and not a dinner place? Maybe i hit this place on an off night and it's a possibility you might get a better prepared meal. I don't know.  This was more disappointing to me than the not so fresh sushi I had last week somewhere.  Jennifer needs to taste the food her cook prepares before it's too late.  I will not return.

Not only was Angelo's Italian lemon water ice awful but they also had the nerve to charge a BLEEPING ten dollars for our two cups. We tossed them in the garbage after one spoonful.  Very artificial in taste with an odd texture and very expensive.

Honestly this was the best hair salon I've been to in Arizona. This Hair salon isn't the cheapest but it was about HALF the PRICE of Rolf's in Arrowhead and I received a much better treatment than a similar I got at Rolf's. (not saying Rolf's is bad but my experience wasn't the best maybe due to one particular stylist) When I was done all the other women being done at the salon OOHED and Aah at me admiring my hair they were impressed. People do stop me about my hair often and my hair was checked out and searched recently at a certain airport.  Kandy said she did my highlights in the NEW MODERN WAY not the old fashioned way. Not with foil but painted on ends like hers.  Her Prodigy did most of my styling under Kandy's direction so I wasn't sure how to tip correctly so I did wind up tipping extra. ( not a big deal) The Bumble and Bumble products are nice. I think using all of them is too expensive but will shell out for the styling creme since it goes a long way. I was happy and I am not Usually happy with a hair style,that says a lot!.. more than you know.

Who knew at the Fashion Square is a very good cafeteria? It's nice that you can see a sample of each platter so you know what to expect.They do pizzas , soups , salads , Sandwiches , pasta and entrees and the most expensive meal is $13.50 for grilled skirt steak .  They say on their menu that they use cage free eggs, organic  local  (when in season) sustainable foods in season produce .   I had their Nicoise Style Salmon Salad . ($12.25) It was delicious. The seasonings were just right , the salmon was cooked nice everything was good. It was great that the salmon and potatoes were warm .   My husband had the Cilantro Lime Chicken salad . He said it was very good but seemed a little light for him so I gave him most of my potatoes , eggs and some salmon .  The only down sides of cafeteria dining were if you are with packages it's hard to hold a tray and if your meal is all cold they hand you your platter and the hot items are ran out to you so you might not get your meals together.

Based on only two meals I give them an above average rating for Thai Cuisine. We had the special of the day that was spicy duck basil. The duck was prepared surprisingly good and the flavors seemed right. We also had the spicy pumpkin basil with ground chicken. The chicken wasn't that supermarket kind of ground but was more like chopped up well chicken that was moist with some developed flavor and not just cooked and tossed in. The flavors were about right. If I knit pick I can say the dish would have been better if the pumpkin was cooked more because it was slightly crunchy and the basil should have been broken down more instead of being like mini branches of basil. But over all we both were pleased and plan to return.  The decor is very tacky but in a good way. Fake fish swimming in the fish tank. and stuff glued on the walls everywhere. Novelty hugging salt and pepper shakers are for sale for $3.@.

I suppose if all goes well as it appears it normally does you will have a positive experience. It didn't appear to be crazy busy when we arrived as approximately ten people were ahead of us. Also it didn't seem like the line was moving either and we waited and waited and waited while the woman in front of us left because she couldn't wait any longer. By the time we got to the cashier a half hour passed and we thought maybe the cashier was new since she seemed to be extra careful in taking our order and also took the time to repeat it back for accuracy. So we  picked a table and waited another thirty nine minutes. My meal was fine and correct I'd give maybe four stars if I IGNORE THE ONE HOUR NINE MINUTES TO WAIT FOR LUNCH.   Besides the wait, a couple key parts of my husbands lunch never made it to the plate. He didn't receive the caramelized onions on his roast beef sandwich and didn't receive the goat cheese on his REd Pepper AND Goat Cheese salad. (waiting sixty nine minutes for lunch) I am not sure of what kind of quality the roast beef should have been but on this past Saturday it wasn't like real roast beef it was like that lunch meat that comes in a tub but thicker. When he saw he didn't have the onions he ran over to them them as he didn't notice the missing goat cheese at that point. I tasted the roast beef and agreed it wasn't what we were expecting it to be since we read the chicken and turkey are roasted in house we thought the roast beef would also be good. So he was sort of upset eating inferior roast beef without onions after waiting sixty nine minutes. I know we weren't the only ones that waited that long but maybe were the only ones that had a platter missing stuff.  The woman in charge did stop by and apologized and said, "it was a crazy day, we are never like this" and she did hand my husband his money back for his meal.   My husband looked at me and said, "what good does this do me, why would I want an unpleasant experience for free?" I said you have a point.

I KNOW now that some flavors are better than others.  I took a bite out of my husbands cinnamon cupcake,it was OK not too sweet, sort of moist and about the right amount of spice. It tasted like a cinnamon bun.  BUT THE LEMON one was disappointing and half of it got tossed in the trash. The top had a candy decoration that was so hard I almost broke my teeth on it so I spit it out. (maybe I wasn't suppose to eat it???) The frosting had lemon in it but was AS SWEET AS EATING STRAIGHT 10X SUGAR from the bag (it really tasted like straight 10x sugar with a little bit of lemon rind ) . I love sweets and IF I SAY THIS WAS TOO SWEET it was since it's like a mouse saying something like there is too much cheese in the cheese trap, it's THE SAME thing . I tried the frosting and the cake together, it still didn't work to me .  The main taste in the cake part of my lemon cupcake was EGG it was like egg flavored cake . The cupcake had almost no lemon flavor but it was moist.   I would NEVER eat a lemon cupcake from here again and it was a mess to park here.

QUANTITY NOT QUALITY mostly NOT EDIBLE  The good- my ice tea and the pickle chips.  The bad- rye bread as thick as my thumb (rye bread should be thin) low fat  low quality corned beef that appeared to be previously frozen because of dark color but had added grease fat added to each side of each slice of meat that seemed to be mostly burger grease (because of the remnants of burger I found in my sandwich) and other assorted grease. The dressing was thinned down to a milky substance. The cheese used was processed not real cheese . The sour kraut had a few of someones grilled burger onions in it.   The salad was water logged and not drained and I had an inch or more of water in the bowl.  The waitresses all were sleeveless and that doesn't seem sanitary because of all that reaching everywhere how do you know if some deodorant or antiperspirant didn't flake off into your food?    My waiter seemed very rushed the whole time.  Felt sick to my stomach after here.  and on the way out I saw ketchup bottles on the patio tables outside that may have been opened and were possibly spoiling in the high heat outside.  I know most people only enjoy the fatty breakfast here since they are used to that  and that is cool . They are really large and most people I saw were LOVING that!

I thought the food might be decent because of the very good Yelp Rating.  My husband started with the minestrone soup. The soup was very thin and watery with a burnt taste. I note this soup didn't have any beans or pasta in it but only large pieces of falling apart over cooked vegetables.  We both ordered Mediterranean Salads with Chicken. The Menu reads mixed greens but they gave us iceberg lettuce. The chicken had a nice seasoning and was a nice portion but was pounded flat and dry like chalk. The tomatoes they gave us were going bad and the artichokes were grey with old age. The roasted red peppers weren't fresh made and sweet but were full of citric acid taste. I didn't care for the dressing because it was just full of chemicals and very harsh tasting. I thought for the $12.95 price this was a very low quality salad.  I noticed this place attracts a very blue collar crowd as the man seated next to me ordered two breakfast plates. I also noticed his potatoes didn't look homemade.  I think the name for this restaurant might be incorrect because the sign out side reads Times Square Neighborhood Family Restaurant.  Maybe they are better at Pizza?

We decided to retry Times Square HOPING they'd be better for dinner.  We started with a glass of wine. My husband ordered the Malbec so I decided to have the same. I found it undrinkable so I pushed it aside and drank water.  They feature many chicken dishes on the dinner menu so I thought chicken might be a safe bet so I ordered the Pollo Ortega. My waiter told me I made a good choice saying it was about the best item on the menu. It sounded tasty and was described as sautéed Chicken with Mushrooms in a garlic basil tomato sauce with spicy red peppers.   I soon receive two pounded flat dry pale (not browned at all) almost tasteless breast of chicken with a next to tasteless thin bland red oily sauce. sitting by nicely cooked spaghetti with that next to tasteless bland thin oily sauce and a big basket of garlic toast that tasted like 1/2 butter 1/2 plain cooking oil with some dry herbs sprinkled on that also was bland and oily.  There was nothing fresh tasting about any of the food I tried and certainly fresh herbs weren't used in either of our meals here.   My husband wasn't too thrilled with his Veal Ossobucco he said it lacked developed flavors and the fat wasn't cooked out and also was in a bland sauce.  For me this is a borderline one star rating but when I think about the review I did on 1-26-14 this is just a smidgen above it.  Dry almost tasteless Chicken in bland oily sauce.  1.5 stars

Short Story  Bland  Bland Unappetizing Painfully Slow Not being checked on Loud Old Music Blaring   Longer Story  I received a watery funky unknown flavor of iced tea and I knew things would decline. The dining room was very loud with music but it was mostly but not all sounds of the forty's I suspect. The restaurant didn't seem busy as it only had a few tables seated but it might have taken about a half hour to prepare a salad and the sandwich we ordered and another half hour for the server to return.  I receive my salad and the greens were fresh and good and I will go on to say the blue cheese tasted like a good blue cheese. The turkey however was very dry chalky white meat that lacked flavor and the house made concoction of cranberry relish was something I didn't relish . It was lumpy thick and creamy and was hard to identify a taste because it was not good to me. I could not eat it. So I ate very dry flavorless turkey on wet plain greens and the only flavoring I got was from the blue cheese. Our server was walking around like in slow motion and never made it over to check on us.  My husband tasted my dish and just like last week he said, "WOW that's Bad! Then he tried his dish. He also had a plain green salad without dressing. He said the ciabatta bread was good but his sandwich was tasteless. I tried a tiny bite of the chicken. It was cooked nice but was oddly tasteless. I wouldn't say his plate was awful it just wasn't tasty.  We finished and waited for a LONG TIME for our server to give us the check.  My review is based on just one lunch visit.  2.5 stars

They do serve nice Lunch Bento Boxes SEVEN DAYS a week priced $11-18.  I had the salmon teriyaki lunch bento box ($13) that included an oriental sauced side mix green salad,steamed rice,one large tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables (two big pieces of sweet potato, one zucchini,one onion ring) My salmon was tasty and a perfect size for lunch,not only did I get all that food I mentioned but my salmon was on top of pan seared mixed vegetables including baby bok choy.   Service was especially good from our server and the manager.

So far This is the only True Neapolitan Certified pizza that I tried that taste good to me. This weekend we tried the famous Bianca D.O.C. pizza (white pizza $12) and the Regina Margherita D.O.C. ($14) The margherita was tasty flavorful and very light,the dough was wet but did have some structure and was seasoned perfect so it wasn't necessary to add a thing. I did find the bufala cheese too wet for this pie and prefer the Margherita D.O.C.  (difference is house made mozzarella and a $4 savings $10) The Bianca pie was much sturdier and also not wet. For my taste the pie is very garlicky and for my taste next time I will be adding the onion option for $2 more to balance the flavors more.  Next to us the people were having the home made cheese cake and it looked so light and fluffy I got a piece to try the next day. I tried a little and it was light,not too sweet but was light on the vanilla. I prefer this style and think it was the best I've tried in years.  I've been here several times and always had outstanding service here.

As a slight update, I do find inconsistencies with the pizzas from here. Our pizza that we shared was unseasoned this time and just OK. I do note a person other than the owner prepared our pizza. Usually the pizzas are very good and for sure are the best that Glendale has to offer. But this was my second time I got an off pizza out of several times so that does happen sometimes. I note the pizza was still good but not special.  We also had salads they were large and fresh but not fancy.  Pizzas from here are not the average pizzas they are the light and chewy certified D.O.C. pizzas. The cheese is made in-house.  3-4 stars

La Piazza al Forno is one of the few places in the Valley that serves Certified Neapolitan Specialty Pizzas.   This time I received a perfect Margherita Pizza! The Crust was tender and with a little crispness, it was soft in the middle but I was able to pick up the slices. The tomatoes were delicious and came threw. The cheese was flavorful and just right. The basil and added Calabrian Peppers really made it pop! That pizza was excellent! This really was the best tasting pizza I had in the valley.  I've been here many times and I can't give 5 stars because the last two times I was here the pizzas differed so I don't know if you or me will get a perfect one next time. If you take the time to view the photos I posted perviously you can see how the pizzas can differ.  The popular dinner Special here is the spaghetti pie and I can tell you the Cheese Cake from here is Outstanding.  Service from here always has been friendly and efficient.

Pappadeaux is pronounced Pappa Dough I think of it now as Pappa don't season the food here.  I really liked the building inside and out. The patio is charming and the inside looks so old fashioned and established. The wait staff looks professional and the place is very lively with lots of activity. What I didn't like about the atmosphere was all the NOISE! It was so loud you have to shout at anyone you talk to and it is very hard to hear the server.  Maybe because it was early in the evening the Gumbo was very watery and needed to cook down. It was kind of disappointing and lacked depth of flavor but was slightly spicy. We also shared a very average but very fresh house salad that had very strong red onions in it and tasty fresh made seasoned croutons. The salad was good.  I tried the Rock Port Redfish, it was very large and generous. The Shrimp and Crab that came with it were overcooked, sort of hard and dry but the Redfish was cooked nice but not so tasty. I think they forgot to add salt, pepper, olive oil because it was unseasoned. The fish had a very nice texture but left a not so tasty taste in my mouth. Maybe I was just tasting blood line from the fish. I try to eat fish all the time on weekends since I can't buy fresh fish near me, I enjoy fish and have had Redfish before but it never seemed disappointing before. I can't say it was bad either but it just wasn't tasty. It came with a barley salad. I ate barley salad till I was full and thought it was also unseasoned until I took my last two bites and it tasted good. I got salt and pepper and tasty toasted almonds in it. Those last two bites were delicious but unfortunately It seemed the barley salad wasn't mixed correctly so on most of what I ate I didn't get it the way it was meant to be.  My husband's complaint about the shrimp creole was mostly on the creole sauce. He said the tomatoes were good but it completely lacked creole flavor and could have almost passed for a spaghetti sauce. He said the grits had little flavor on their own but got some from the tossed in andouille sausage. We don't know but maybe they did give him the wrong sauce as they do have something with spaghetti sauce on the menu.  Maybe they are normally better but It seemed the kitchen didn't take much care in the food preparation when we were here and at the spendy level price point ( $88.48 with two drinks before tip) I feel a two stars is accurate.

Several people suggested that I revisit Pappadeaux and since it's close and I often eat seafood out I did.  I had a very different exsperience this time. I sat on the patio this time and I found the patio very pleasant and comfortable.  We started with the in house made Hot Smoked Salmon appetizer. We received a generous portion of salmon topped with a mustard herb sauce and seasoned thin crisp bread toasts. The salmon seemed like it was slow cooked as it just melted like butter in your mouth. I also liked that it was lightly smoked and not too much so you could get the yummy taste of the sauce with it. I thought this was a masterfully prepared dish and this one really wowed me as I would like to get it again some time.  We received our dinners. My husband ordered the Gulf Coast Redfish Pontchartrain and I got the Halibut with spaghetti squash. I taste the redfish and this one is perfect, it's fresh, tasty and prepared perfect. Then I taste the Halibut and it's overcooked and dry. I sort of feared sending it back since it was still edible but my husband convinced me to do so. We flagged the waiter over and he took care of it right away and sent the manager over.  The manager and the waiter were extremely kind and didn't at all make me feel guilty for sending the fish back. They also remade my husband's dinner so he could have a fresh one with me and also gave him the option of nibbling on the current one he had if he wanted to. The manager even suggested having some salad or soup while we wait he really couldn't be more hospitable.  We receive our new dinners and both were very good. My Halibut was MUCH BETTER as it was tasty and flaky and moist. The Spaghetti squash was good it was slightly sweet and buttery and the redfish was nailed perfect again, it was really delicious. The manager checked on us and said we could have dessert on them. We enjoyed the dinners very much and over ate a bit so we didn't have room for dessert but we saw someone walk by with a dessert tray and they looked really good.  This was an educational exsperience for me.  I know I can come back to Pappdeaux because the food will be good or they will do their best to make it again right for you.  I will try to be a better diner and say something to my server if I need too.

Everything I had exceeded my expectations.  My waiter suggested to try the Charred English Peas so we did and they really were an unexpected pleasant surprise. You can eat them the same way you eat edamame. The peas were big and beautiful and firm the way they should be.  I had the Ahi Salad and the freshness and quality of the ahi made this an enjoyable meal. The salad was very fresh and was made with butter lettuce, fresh green beans and pitted quality olives.  My husband had the spinach salad and the gumbo. He was very impressed with the spinach salad and said outside of New Orleans this was the best gumbo he had.  Everything we had was done nicely.  The Big Open Kitchen was nice , clean and organized.  Service was great!  BAM!

AGAIN EVERYTHING EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS! BAM!  I didn't plan to come back so soon but did because they wouldn't let us have the antipasto menu at Otto Enoteca and it turned out to be a very good thing.  I didn't know they have a top ten in the country mixologist here so we tried the special $7 cocktails. All the drinks were very creative combinations and that's a great price for Vegas and the drinks were very good!  We shared the YUMMY English Peas that you eat like edamame. My husband had to have the gumbo again since it's so good here.  I had the striped bass that's served whole. The fish was as fresh as can be and was prepared to perfection. The dish came with lemon risotto that was prepared perfect and wasn't the traditional flavor of risotto but the lemon flavor coordinated well with the entree. The risotto was garnished with fresh pea shouts and fresh peas. My husband had the whitefish with fresh crab heirloom tomatoes with a fresh cucumber sauce that was delicious as well.  The service again was PHENOMENAL!  Emeril can be very proud his employees do a Great Job Here!  4.5 Stars

Where else on the Strip are you going to find a four course dinner fresh made for you dinner that might include COLORADO FILET MIGNON for only $45.00?  Table Ten is running a special summer menu where you can pick from many items of the regular menu and create your own four course menu for $45.00.  I didn't want to eat the rolls but they were piping hot and fresh with steam coming out so I couldn't resist.  I started with a salad made with fresh marinated artichokes arugula and fresh mozzarella. The balsamic dressing stood out to me and seemed very high end.  Whisper thin maybe 50/50 pasta (semolina and flour combo) with bite to it carefully made raviolis were stuffed with tasty mushrooms in a thin but creamy butter laced sauce.  I wasn't expecting a full sized Filet but received a delicious one with a tasty seasoned crust cooked a perfect medium rare. The supporting spinach was fresh and seasoned just right with garlic, salt and pepper. The red wine sauce wasn't necessary since the steak was very good on its own but completed the plate.  I never had a Banana Cream pie before and always thought I wouldn't like it because I imagined Jello Banana pudding but when you get an Emeril's Banana Cream pie you get banana's on steroids. It's mostly ripe fresh bananas adorned with the best accompaniments.  Just right amounts of caramel, fresh REAL whipped cream and chocolate shavings.  Everything including service exceeded my expectations.  BAM you did it again!

I don't remember the last time while dining at any restaurant where I was given a piping hot steaming roll out of the oven like I got here, that was a nice start.  We both started with salads, I had the beet and goat cheese and salad with those great house made candied salted pecans with mixed greens. This salad had the PERFECT play of sweetness and saltiness and was perfectly dressed with a delicious taste. The goat cheese was high quality meaning not tangy. The portion was generous ($8.)  I went with the hanger steak special ($23.). I wasn't sure if the steak would be tender ordering it medium or medium rare but my server informed me that they use high quality grade of steak and it would be tender no matter how I ordered it. At first I was a little bummed that it came with only feta side salad instead of a vegetable and potato like one usually expects, but when I tasted everything I was blown away. Everything was perfect, a perfect sauce, perfect steak and a salad that exceeded my expectations.  My husband went with pasta special ($22) that was made with three different in-house made sausages, sweet, hot, and fennel. He said the taste was phenomenal and we'd have to come here more often. I do note the pasta was slightly over cooked.  I noticed most people were ordering the fish and chips special made with cod. On a past visit I had a similar soup to one I had at Bouchon and honestly Amuse Bouche soup was better. I was too full for dessert this time but the pots de creme here is exceptional.  The only downside I see here is the very limited daily changing menu, and you might have to go out of your comfort zone and order something you might not usually get. The only dinner that seems to be regular on the menu is the bacon wrapped meatloaf  ($15)  I've been here several times for dinner, it's always good to exceptional for dinner. You have to make a reservation because this place is tiny and you have to bring your own booze they charge $3 a glass fee.  4.5 stars

I've been here for dinner several times and always had an experience that exceeded my expectations. Coming back from Vegas you almost pass this place by so we stopped here at lunch time.  You can tell by looking at my photo this is an above average salad. The eggs weren't that chalky well done kind but cooked medium. The salmon was a good quality and fresher than what I can find at the store ,  also prepared medium and was herb crusted. The salad was dressed perfect and was fresh and tasty. I didn't think I would like the sweet almonds but did because the sweetness was cut with salt. The salad was hearty and generous in size and all the flavors went well together.  My husband had the cabernet burger and ordered it medium rare. The Chef ran out to deliver our plates to us. He was very happy that someone ordered a medium rare burger since most people who order it ask for well done , I think we made his day. My husband said the burger was very good and we think the roll might have been made in house since they are French Culinary Trained Chefs in cooking and baking and we had the fresh baked rolls before at dinner time. The burger also was above average since the meat for it was just FRESH GROUND. I don't know of any place near by to here that does fresh ground burgers. The fries were unique. The fries had an almost sweet buttery taste to them almost like buttery pastry.  I really like them for dinner and they are B.Y.O.B so you can save some money going here but it's a tiny place with a small changing menu so you need to call and ask what they are serving.  We were happy we stopped here.  4.5 stars For sure above average.

I've been here quite a few times for dinner and once for lunch. The proteins are always fresh and very good quality. I never had anything under or over cooked here.  Amuse Bouche is one of the very few places that actually bakes you your own bread for dinner. The bread was HOT and nice and crusty but I do note did lack salt this time.  We decided to try the Risotto Cakes. I tasted the Fennel Cilantro Aioli and didn't think I'd like it on Risotto Cakes but I was pleasantly surprised that it added the right layers of flavors to the very well made risotto cakes. They were interesting.  They were offering a larger dinner menu than from my previous visits and were offering seven very different dinners of different proteins. I liked that my server informed me that they were flexible with the dinners meaning I could swap things around if something didn't suit me.   I tried the Barramundi. The Fish tasted amazingly fresh and was simple but perfection. The Crayfish Fondue was very well made but I thought the braised spinach seemed very average. Nothing was wrong with it I guess it's just me not being a big fan of baby spinach.  My husband tried the Smoked Pork Chop with Savory Apple Bread Pudding in a Cider Reduction also with Spinach. He said it was also prepared perfect. The Pork Chop was juicy and tender. He liked the smoke to it and the sauce was very well made. He also enjoyed the Savory Apple Bread Pudding.   It was very hard to turn down their delicious dessert of Bread pudding that I tasted at the "Flavors of the West Food Festival" It truly might have been the best bread pudding I ever tried but I thought I had enough bread today so I went with their amazing Pot de Creme. The sophisticated grown up chocolate pudding is topped with fresh just whipped up REAL whipped Cream. For certain it's among the best desserts you can get anywhere.  Amuse Bouche is a very tiny B.Y.O.B. if you plan to come here you absolutely need to make a reservation. They charge $3 a person Cork fee .  4.5 stars

This is my favorite fast casual HEALTHY place for a non-gutt busting lunch or light dinner that is  somewhat close to the Arrowhead Mall area and it is NOT A CHAIN like the one on same street near by.  I have been here many times and everything to pick from on the stir fry line has always been very fresh and clean as can be . Yesterday I picked chicken ,water chestnuts , cilantro , green onions , carrots , bean sprouts , broccoli & chewy noodles . I then sauced them with white wine , hoisin , sesame oil ,garlic , ginger ,and chili , next they cooked it up for me and I was on my way to enjoy it at the table .   My meal came out Perfect! This doesn't taste like Chinese Take out because it is very light and never salty , never oily , never burnt and never old . I never take a second plate but you can eat as many stir Fry's as you like during your stay .  You don't have to make your meal with any of the 3 styles of noodles because you can take steamed rice from the mini buffet that is included , other things I saw on the mini buffet were breaded fried chicken , cheese wantons , soups , fried noodles , jello and donuts . I am not a fan of the mini buffet but I do help myself to a donut now and then .  My companion's meal was not sauced correctly so it didn't taste as good that is the only down side to dining here also they charge extra for picking tofu or shrimp as your protein .  Lunch for two people with 2 drinks was approx $21 before tip ....................... the healthiest you can find in Arrowhead Mall Area......

WHERE ELSE might you find Tacos of chicken sautéed in yellow mint coconut curry and sweet tangy tamarind chutney? If that doesn't do it for you maybe the slow roast chicken basil almond pesto red pepper balsamic cruda taco will do. And if your feeling beefy the number eleven wasabi seared steak in Chinese black bean salsa with crisp cabbage slaw wasabi crema you might dig into? They got all that and bunches more but those were the ones I tried that were all awesome delicious not just sauced up but developed with great flavors and topped with out of the ordinary ingredients.   Only $2.50  each for these gourmet tacos!  Side dishes cost .75 cents each I tried the quinoa salad. After the mind blowing tacos this salad didn't do it for me but it might for you.  If you are coming from out of town I recommend that you call to make sure they are open. Last year in August they closed with out notice, everything was packed up, and when I called the phone rang and rang without a message.   They are a little hard to find. No sign on top of the restaurant. Only a picture of a big sombrero on a side wall. The inside is very raw and the chairs were made in a wood shop.  4.5 stars  This one made it for my Las Vegas Rotation!

Classy as a Lap Dancer leaving a skid mark on a man's lap that is a indication of the way they cook filet's of beef here here . (crap on your plate)  Remember the Movie Logan's Run where they killed everyone that reached 30 years old well I am over 30 but I felt like dying after trying my meal we've been here years ago but thought maybe they weren't as bad as we remembered .  We were seated and it took around 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us as we noticed the table next to us that got seated latter and already had food before we even had water ok so that was no big deal it happens all the time at chains .  My husband ordered the $4.99 for 2 margarita's (I knew better) and I took a sip and it tasted like you licked a spoonful of dry artificial drink mix . (YUK)  This place had a MASSIVE amount of peanut shells and DUST all over the floor so if you were wearing flip flops you might cut your toes on shells .  They have a bucket of peanuts on every table and I hope little dirty kids hands weren't on them not to mention peoples coughs .  When my meal arrived I thought it looked ALMOST picture perfect because my vegetable skewer looked great with real fresh vegetables on it but when I tasted them they were awful because they brushed them with I COULD TASTE cheap Italian dressing and some sort of brown NASTY sauce (YUK) ! Then I saw my potato with all that melted whipped butter that looked like SPIT (YUK)! (it wasn't but looked like that the way the butter melted)  but maybe the WORST was what they did to the filet....WTB (bleep) they brushed the filet with liquid smoke and maybe a terriyakki sauce and that was another YUK! I consider the filet not edible the way it tasted and took it home for dog treats (I washed sauce off for my dog of course) The sauces on the vegetables and on my filet were awful and ruined them in taste and as far as I know they are not listed in description on menu . This was not the most expensive meal but not that cheap either (mine was $16) but even if it was free I still would not recommend . Now that I Yelped I will remember years from now that I didn't like .   One star ?  two stars ? but my understanding of definition is eeks me thinks not meaning I won't go back not just I had better...duh..I am not a fan of here.....maybe you are?.....not the best  quality but it really is too amateur to go out for it's like your relative that can't cook and just throws stuff in a bag with Italian dressing and then throws it on the grill .   it was close and I didn't feel like going far but I should have done a Logan's RUN AWAY!

I am just happy to have a nice salad for lunch. The Herb Peppered Salmon Salad was tasty and a not too heavy meal for lunch although it appeared to be large enough to feed a family. The Salmon was prepared about medium and was a good portion. My salad had marinated chopped tomatoes and grape tomatoes (I thought that was odd) red onions cucumbers and what I think were bottled red roasted peppers because I didn't taste can but they didn't seem fresh roasted either. The salad overall tasted good and came with a piece of herbed flat bread to fill you up.  My husband had the Milano Salad it was like an Italian Hoagie in a salad, overall he liked it but thought it's dressing didn't have enough zing (vinegar).  They have many interesting sounding things on the menu and I will most likely visit again because they serve lunch NOT just Brunch on Saturday (Sunday I don't know)  I noticed they might? have a dog friendly patio because I saw a big container of dog treats.  Service was very friendly and efficient.  But-  Parking is very limited and you might have to park on the street or a nearby lot.  I do NOTE-  I would never use the ketchup here because they keep it outside on the patio in containers you can't see threw. Ketchup once opened does start to spoil when it is not refrigerated. In a restaurant the ketchup isn't handled the same way as in your home. I've seen many ketchup bottles burst from going bad in an indoor environment. Outdoors in AZ heat must be worst.  Overall a nice place but I have to add my two cents about the ketchup.

The weekend 11-3 Lunch Special ($11.95) is GREAT! It's like a buffet BUT BETTER because they cook up your food fresh as you want it. You pick from about FIVE appetizers and FIVE entrees and two desserts ALL YOU WANT!  We tried chick pea ceviche, lentil towers, and paratha. I liked the chick pea ceviche and the lentil tower best. The paratha is basically bread. We picked Tikka Masala with chicken and quinoa and Chicken Vindaloo with brown rice. Both were good with the chicken being fresh and moist. The Tikka Masala had a little heat to it and a slight sweetness to it. The Vindaloo was much more savory with much more heat that did build up. When we finished our server asked us what entree we'd like to try next but we declined another entree but decided to try the carrot halwa. The carrot halwa is almost like a pudding but without starch and it seemed healthy.  I was told by the server that this is AMERICANIZED Indian food made heathy style without butter or cream and nothing is fried here almost everything is 500 calories or less.  The New Times Awarded Them "Best use of a chickpea" for the Chickpea Ceviche. Chef Sunil Kumar's recipe is posted on Examiner.com Jon Kapoor's (Executive Chef at Bombay Spice) has his recipe for Tikka Marsala Sauce posted on abc15.com Sonoran Living.  The weekend lunch special is a great introduction to try Indian style cuisine.

I was a little disappointed that my server didn't offer me the bottomless weekend lunch special. The weekend lunch special is something like $11.95 and all you can eat appetizers lunch plates and dessert. I had it last time and it was very good.  At the time I thought they discontinued it but the table next to me got the menu for it but I still had an enjoyable lunch here anyway.  They offer an appetizer sampler plate where you pick four appetizers for $11.95. I picked Chickpea ceviche, Lentil Cake Towers, Chicken Tikka Kebab, and Chicken Seekh Kabab. My husband liked the Seekh Kabab best and said to him it tasted like sausage and peppers. I thought everything was tasty and flavorful and the chicken was prepared very well being moist tender and flavorful. It was a good amount of food but not quite enough for two people so we shared a Hot Chicken Vindaloo.  The Vindaloo was very spicy and chicken was very moist tender and flavorful. I thought this dish was presented very nicely with the Indian Style Bread ( Naan) and Cracker  (Papadum).This dish cost $9.45 and I added mixed vegetables to the dish for a $1.00 more. I don't mean to knit pick but if I'm being totally honest I need to mention my server told me the mixed vegetables were a mix of the vegetable choices Like cauliflower eggplant and other stuff but what I recieved were similar to frozen mix you buy at the store (carrots peas corn but I won't dwell on that and let it slide). I'd make a different vegetable selection next time.  The food here is Americanized Indian Style food that is mostly Low Fat and Healthy. They offer healthy side dishes like quinoa and brown rice. No Butter or Ghee is in the house, they use Olive Oil instead. The restaurant is casual but stylish.  They also are accommodating to Vegans and Vegetarians.

Fun food with a sense of humor  ( the what's in this steak ) , comfort and celebrities to be spotted . ( Athletes and Food Network Stars)   We've been here before and have always enjoyed everything.  This time we decided to try both specials of the evening since they sounded so good and we were given a sample of  the sauce of one to try .  One meal was the lamb shoulder with bolognese sauce that came with wax beans , brussels sprouts and potato croquettes , everything on this plate was great and well thought out . This was a very comforting dish .  The other was short rib with crab and sweet potato gnocchi . The rib and crab were good . The sweet potato gnocchi had good flavor but were too heavy and dense for my liking .  The menu here has a lot of variety  and includes several seafood dishes .  I didn't encounter any problem here using my preferred restaurant card getting me one meal for free . Eddie's House is among my favorites in old town Scottsdale .

Over the Years I think I've been here maybe a half dozen times and have a different experience each time due to what I order. My conclusion is that Eddie's House does comfort foods with a creative twist best. Simple home Style foods with maybe a sauce or seasoning that you might not be familiar with.  The complimentary signature blue cheese butter, pistou sauce and bread arrived and this time the butter was soft and irresistible. It's just TOO DELICIOUS to pass up.  We ordered off the menu even after hearing about the specials that sounded good and started with the grilled honey spiced chicken lollipops. I was expecting them to be small but they were THREE BIG juicy chicken legs with a really crispy skin with sauce and a dusting of seasoning that tasted really good.   For dinner I had the Chermoula Roasted Chilean Sea Bass with Candied Lemon Broccoli. It was a simple dish of just fish and broccoli but not so simple. The fish (a not so big portion for $40.00 but this kind of fish is very exspensive) was  Moroccan Style marinated in Chermoula that's delicious and the broccoli was also delicious just the right little hint of sugar and the lemon that cut and brighten the sweet. I don't think they can win any awards for presentation but the food really was spot on. The fish was cooked threw and juicy with a slight crust and the broccoli was also perfect. Eddie's Chef came out to my table to make sure he prepared my Sea Bass  correctly since it's the hardest dinner to prepare just right. Normally I'm disappointed if I only get a plate with just a single vegetable and a protein because when you entertain people you prepare them a another side of something like maybe a potato  or rice but I'm giving giving Eddie's a pass on this because of the very above average bread and sauces that you have to indulge on that I wouldn't normally eat but did.  They also nailed my husbands Prosciutto Wrapped Filet with Lobster (big pieces) risotto and topped with brussels sprouts salad.  We don't always get dessert here because it's very home style like your mother might have made it but thought the fresh Apple Cobbler sounded good and it was.  Eddie's House participates in LocalDines.Com and you can save a great deal of money on your dinner check if you use it.

When you enter Eddie's House it's a little different atmosphere than from most other restaurants. It's more like your walking into Eddie's real house because of all the personalized knick knacks and family photos. You will also see a lot of fishing items and notice Eddie is a fisherman. The fishing gear is also reflects on the many fresh fish items on the menu. Chef Eddie also participates in many local charity events.   In the metro Phoenix area Eddie has known as a celebrity chef and has made a lot of appearances on local TV. Eddie now might be considered a celebrity chef everywhere because he recently won an award from FoodNetwork's TV Show Triple G- Guy's Grocery Games and made his signature dish bacon infused meatloaf.  I've been here a bunch of times over the years and always enjoy Eddie's complimentary blue cheese butter, fresh herb pistou sauce with the bread. It's so delicious and it's so hard to stop eating. It's a nice treat.  We started with the grilled honey spiced chicken lollipops. They plump juicy nicely and seasoned well. The legs were cleaned up real nice so they were easy to eat. They were delicious anyone would like them.  I ordered the half portion of a signature dish called, "what's in this steak". It's a juicy nicely cooked tenderloin in the center of a big ball of yummy mashed potatoes with a crispy cheesy crust. My tenderloin was prepared perfect and was tasty. The potatoes were yummy. It's something different.   My husband had the bacon infused meatloaf. It was topped with crisp onion straws and was served with mashed potatoes. It was tasty after all it's an OFFICIAL Food Network Winning Dish!  It don't always like desserts out but did try the cheesecake after questioning the waitress about it a bit. It turns out the white chocolate blueberry cheesecake was really good. We both enjoyed it and my husband usually hates cheesecake but even he liked it.  Eddie's House participates in Local Dines where you can save a bunch if you use it.  After I dined here I got an email from Eddies House that the menu will be updated soon. I'm looking forward to salmon tartar, mustard and GHOST Chili pickles and Wild Salmon with shititso relish and peach quiona. New lobster dishes will also be on the menu.

This little restaurant with a big patio serves of an assortment of dishes that are made with French Taught Techniques. Chef Aurore has trained in France.   We placed our order and waited around a half hour for our lunches. I do have to give our waiter credit for spotting that my husband's request to omit the aioli for his sandwich was ignored by the cook. The waiter gives my husband the choice of eating it anyway or getting a new one made with his request of no aioli. My husband wanted a new one so we waited maybe another half hour while my salad is sitting in the window all this time getting warm and wilted.  Our plates arrive and as warm and slightly wilted as my salad is the salad was masterfully made and very layered with flavors. The creamy shallot vinaigrette was so delicious I could drink it and I never tasted walnuts that were so complex before. I also need to add that the house smoked salmon might have been the most delicious buttery fresh salmon I've ever had anywhere. However the house baked bread that came with it came out and seemed stale and not so tasty.   Unfortunately the cooks that were on don't take to re-fires very well and inflicted something on the pork in my husband's sandwich. The pork was very dry and was drier than dog food jerky. The pork suffered something like rigor mortis it was deader than dead.  Our waiter seemed busy and didn't ask how our meals were but offered us a complimentary dessert because of the aioli mess up and how long we waited for everything. (he didn't even know about the pork)  I picked the house made chocolate collection. It was an assortment of chocolates that were obviously very high quality. They were extremely good.  This should have been a five star review but lunch shouldn't take two hours, meal request should be honored and I have nothing more to say about the pork as I said enough. I do note I didn't see Chef Aurore in the building.   Also the 4 star rating seems high after everything mentioned but some of the food was so masterfully done I can't give a lower than 4 star rating and chalk this up to them having a bad day.  PHENOMENAL and ABOMINABLE

I had a wonderful time and certainly enjoyed the Trailer Park Musical. I am not critiquing the play only the food.   It's possible to see the show without a meal but you'd have to drive here and find out if tickets are available. Your ticket without a meal will coast somewhere around $20.00 less.  You receive a menu of included starters and entrees and you can also add on appetizers, upgrade your Entrees $10.-$14.@ and add desserts or specialty drinks. We just went with the included foods.  Everyone starts with a salad or Vegetable Beef Soup. We both picked salads, they were OK the menu states that the French Dressing is home made.  I tried the chicken cacciatore. The chicken didn't have a natural taste to it and I don't know but think it was injected with something but I don't know what it was, it wasn't a chicken taste. This dish was very bland and seemed free of salt and pepper. The sauce was thick almost like tomato paste. It was edible and better than a frozen dinner but that's about it. My plate did come with roasted red skin potatoes that really did taste good after a dose of salt and pepper. The plate came with a creamed corn casserole. I don't know how they made it but it tasted like a box of cake mix, a box of corn muffin mix , a can of creamed corn, mixed with sour cream and baked. It possibly  was a recipe from Sandra Lee of Semi Home Made.   My husband tried the Beef Tenderloin Kabob that also came with the same potatoes and corn casserole. The beef was OK but very well done also bland but it had this thick beef gravy on it that tasted very generic.  A table across from us had a visitor that they knew and they asked her how the Baby Back Ribs were and she didn't say anything but made this movement with her wrist like she was turning a dial back and forth. I almost peed my pants I thought hat was funny!  Well it was a good time out!  The food is edible but not the best.

Extremely GOOD well thought out sandwiches and the most tongue thrilling ice cream sandwiches ever !  We've now been here three times for lunch and between us tried most of the sandwiches and every time each one is great .  This time we had pulled pork with pickled red cabbage topped with a surprise of black radish on a fresh bun and the most delicious perfect curried chicken salad on a poppy seed bun . We both picked the salad as our side that is field greens with house vinaigrette and we got a different kind of house made pickle that really WAS a Five star pickle it was tiny almost white and was savory but maybe apple too . Most sandwiches are about $12 but are worth it .  If you never tried the fries you might want too between the size and all the house made dips I don't think they make a penny on them, I think the malt vinegar is good but we are not a fan of the truffle  (got to be aroma but for only $4 you can't blame anyone) ketchup ,also they are seasoned correctly to use with dips but alone the fries are over salted .  The only reason I didn't give five stars is the price of the salads when you add meat to them $18 I had one once and although IT WAS GREAT not worth $18 I don't know if the salad was smaller than it should have been or not I still remember the $7 extra to add the  salmon (maybe 2 oz)  also we've found service hit or miss when an unexpected rush of business happens  but had mostly good service .  The sandwiches are so tasty I have to eat the whole sandwich and I have no room for dessert and MISS the (to die for over the top) ice cream sandwiches I had once before after the $18 salad I had once .

I've been here several times since my last review for lunch and twice for dinner. Sometimes they do hit five stars like when I had this really masterfully crafted dinner with three different heirloom turnips that all looked and tasted different. That dinner was so great we came back with another couple and again the food was very good but that night the portions were so small that even with several plates of appetizers, dinners and desserts three out of four people left hungry and I felt very embarrassed since I suggested Cafe Bink so it's noted that at times the portions can possibly be too small.  I still enjoy coming back for the very above average food.  The breads and Buns are Bink or Binkley's made.  You don't get sauce from a jar it's made here.  They use unique produce that you don't see often on menus.  The moist meat on your salad or sandwich might have been SousVide for four or more hours at 140 degrees.  I enjoyed a very unique interesting salad called Frisee Spaghetti Squash with added Turkey. It was filled with a multitude of different tastes and textures with many small details that were unusual and interesting. The walnuts were roasted but far more roasted than I ever had before and almost were like air when I ate them. The crispy sage leaves were a perfect flavor in this salad and the pomegranate added light refreshing notes to it. The white meat turkey seemed SousvVide as it was moist  and deep with turkey flavor. All the flavors really went together perfect so it was perfection on a plate. This salad also was BIG! This was the VERY FIRST Time I ever had something I wasn't able to finish here!  Good but not as well received was a beet appetizer called BEETS. It was interesting but it was more hazelnuts than beets. The beets were hard to remove from plate because they were as thin as paper and stuck to the plate. The beets were piled with mostly these really roasted airy hazelnuts. Maybe they over did the hazelnuts because they hardly gave me any beets and wanted to give me something? It was good but beets weren't playing a staring role in this dish.  Service is usually very good but when they get busy with only a few on is goes down like many other places do.  They do also have a nice patio but I note it isn't Dog Friendly.  Potential for Five stars is always here.

Short Story - Our beverage order was taken  but nobody took our lunch order and we waited 25 minutes. We arrived when it wasn't busy at 11:10- 11:15  Sunday November 22nd 2015. I took a picture to show you it wasn't busy yet but there were three tables behind me on the patio. I left at 11:40.  Longer Story - I love nearly all the food from all the Binkley Restaurants. The food is always the highest quality, very creative and masterfully prepared. It's usually something unique I won't find anywhere else. Sometimes the food is so great it's mind-blowing. I have blogged about all the Binkley restaurants except for Cafe Bink and have only posted positive things about the food. I go to Binkley's once a year. I visit Scottsdale Bink's and Midtown Bink's a couple times a year as well and I do go to Cafe Bink maybe once or twice a year. Just last week my husband entertained business clients at Bink's Scottsdale and they raved about the wonderful dinners they had. My husband said they drank a lot too..  When we arrived a server told us to pick any table we wanted so I picked a small table that faced the mountain. Our server takes our beverage order and I ordered an iced tea that I received quickly. We were looking forward to starting with a fun vegetable plate or two like the Armenian Cucumbers and were hoping the vegetable plate of the day would be something interesting. For lunch I was torn between several plates. The sole or the roast beef. My husband was going to get the Sloppy Joe and the stuffed Anaheim Chile. He LOVES the Anaheim Chile and had it several times usually at the Scottsdale location.  We waited and waited and noticed several tables that came in after us got waited on.  We waited 25 minutes and we decided that was enough and we'd have to have lunch elsewhere.  To the Binkley Management. Against my husband's wishes I left $4.00 under my iced tea glass not to tip the server but to pay for the beverage I hardly drank. You should have a single iced tea sale rang in before 12:00 November- 22- 2015.  Since nobody cared to wait on me I do feel it wouldn't be out of place to award this visit ONE STAR.  My two stars is possibly overly generous and that's only because the food is usually outstanding.  My blog is www.TheForkingTruth.com   Very VERY unhappy.....Sadly I'm not sure if I will ever visit or recommend this restaurant again.

Sorry this place really sucked .   it was expensive and not worth the money YOU CAN COOK BETTER even if you can't cook..I have no idea why people like and recommend this place .   anything cheese is from what I had is in a fake cheese sauce . Very orange even more so than Velveeta .   The side vegetable (was asparagus ) was cooked till it fell apart and with less skill than the local 2 Star Asian Buffet.   disappointed more so than most places  As only a VERY SLIGHT update 1/22/14  Since my review I haven't been back so I can't update my review but my husband ate here twice. He said the steaks he had were OK. He didn't have vegetables either visit but did have the Green Chile Macaroni and Cheese and said it was very improved from what we had when we were there. I asked him how he'd rate his meals and he said around three stars because it was OK.   Most likely I won't return anyway.

For a long time I was afraid to come here because of the mixed reviews. This is a family friendly sort of sports bar kind of place. It sorts of reminds me of the Ground Round Chain but this is a privately owned place. They offer all the fried goodies and cheesy delights most sports bars have and a mixed menu of family type favorites priced very reasonably. I'm not penalizing them as another Yelper did for the Kraft Mac and Cheese on the menu because it is on the kids menu and is a preferred  food to any young child I know. (sadly)  I ordered the pecan crusted trout. It came with the nicest freshest vegetables and the fish was over a mound of mashed potatoes that were rich with lots of sour cream and butter. The spicy mango salsa was delicious and the trout seemed fresh , tasty and was prepared perfect.   My husband ordered the meatloaf made with angus beef. The plate looked very unattractive but the meatloaf was actually very good with fresh torn sandwich bread threw it.  Service was OUTSTANDING!  I note the vegetables and potato in my ($ 14. something) meal from here were better and fresher than from  a $34. meal I had not too long ago. My Yelp review 3-2-13.  3.75 stars rounded up for value and service.

Short Story  Execution of food was perfect. Flavors and seasonings were spot on. Some unexpected elements of surprise moves the food past four stars. Perfect portions,not too much not too little. Atmosphere maybe isn't quite five stars but I was happy with the food.  Long Story  They started us off with the most amusing looking amuse bouche I've ever seen. A tiny piece of a cherry tomato on a bunch of tiny plates. But wow that tiny morsel of tomato was packed with a mouthful of flavor.  The spicy sausage was very good and the chick peas were clearly NOT of the canned variety and seemed like cooked and then maybe roasted nicely with a crispness.  The simple salad really wasn't so simple as it was made of high end ingredients such as endive, apples, Marcona Almonds, Garrotxa Cheese. The careful slicing of the ingredients made the texture interesting and the vinaigrette was so bright and fresh and perfect the salad was outstanding.  The pasta was perfect and light with the right texture and made with local Hayden Farms semolina flour.I had to ask about the pasta because it looked darker than semolina it really was interesting. I thought the beef short rib ragu was perfect not fatty but cooked down with perfect seasonings.   Prosciutto wrapped fennel and cheese stuffed Pork Loin was prepared perfect being moist and flavored well.  They gave us a giant bowl of green apple cotton candy.  Ricotta fritters were yummy!  The Triple Chocolate Flan really didn't seem like flan but had the taste of pots de creme but not the mouth feel being  what seemed like lighter. It had these praline rice crisps that sort of tasted like hazelnut that were yummy and on the side was a salty buttery cookie that went well with it.  They gave us chocolate chip shortbread cookies to take home.  I was very happy with the food and service.  The dining room is a little dark and I almost needed a flashlight to read the menu. Tables are close together. This is a small restaurant in a strip mall.

They started us off with an amuse bouche of tiny marble size arancinis (fried cheesy rice balls) They were so tasty we thought about asking for more but didn't.  We tried the tasting menu and had a long parade of things to try.  I was very impressed with both of our starters. I've been fortunate to have dined at great places in Las Vegas and Napa and had Raviolos in those places and I have to say the Raviolo I had at Noca was truly the best tasting Raviolo that I have tried so far. The pasta was thin and seasoned just right with the right texture. The egg oozed out in a sexy way revealing a light fresh cheese. The browned butter sage sauce just was the best I've had cooked carefully and enough, not burnt being very tasty and nutty and it had the perfect seasonings. This dish was special.  To me the other starter dish was also a very masterful and well thought out dish. I've never seen a soft boiled FRIED  and lightly breaded egg before. That truly isn't the easiest thing to do with the yolk not coming out chalky but moist instead. The dish was embellished with painstaking shaved asparagus, prosciutto and morel mushrooms. I never seen anyone before cutting the morels in half but I was impressed with that because I know that is the only way to clean a morel. If you didn't know that morels harvest the most dirt of any mushroom because of all their crevices.  In between here and dinner we had the lemon rosemary flat bread. I don't know if they made the wrong portion size or not but they gave me a whole bread. It was made very nice and was very thin but crisp and had a very good aroma from the lemons and rosemary. My husband had the fresh made pasta with Lamb Ragu and Fava beans. He said it was very good. The lamb was nice and tender. The favas were very fresh and the pasta was perfect.  For dinner my husband had the Burrida it's basically the Italian version of Cioppino. The Burrida was packed with fresh mussels, Whole Prawns, Calamari, and Branzino in a spicy tomato broth. My husband said the mussels truly were the best he has ever had.  I had the Hake. It was fresh and very light and almost a tasteless fish but it was seasoned nice and was adorned with Italian condiments including mostarda that made it taste good. I almost want to run out and buy some mostarda now. This dish only came with a high end grain salad being mostly black barley and I think it had a little kamut in it and maybe a few other grains.   Then came a long parade of desserts that I didn't need because I was past my limit at this point.  A big bowl of cotton candy. A Chocolate enrobed chocolate cake stuffed with Nutella Mousse with a fancy cookie garnish and caramel sauce. If this dessert doesn't give you a buzz nothing will. And our other dessert was a blueberry tart topped with a little vanilla ice cream. We thought we were done but then they brought out two small chocolate coated cubes stuffed with a light chocolaty like mousse center.  All I can say is WOW!

Not sure how to rate since this is Las Vegas but if I visited this place near me it would be 2 stars.  My meal only cost around $9.00 and could feed two people. I didn't have the time to go elsewhere since I was at a convention at the Rio   I got what I thought was three broccoli stems with two shiktakki mushroom caps and a few shreds of carrot with a (Maybe) fried slightly crispy block of tofu with slightly hard rice on the side but after eating more I discovered this might be Chinese broccoli because of the ONE leaf I discovered.  The sauce was mild and flavorless and the steamed white rice was hard and crunchy.  The Chinese broccoli steams were very hard to cut with the plastic forks they give you here and the sauce was too mild to enjoy.   But for a Casino this was extremely low priced and maybe better to some people. It was low priced but would go elsewhere If we had the time. It will do in a pinch.

You step in and walk into an upscale grandma's dining room. You might hear as we did a deep Italian Voice singing from the kitchen who might have been the chef. Our waiter also had an Italian accent and was very enthusiastic explaining the evenings dinner specials. We went with one of the appetizer specials and two of the dinner specials since they seemed very good.  Someone soon brings us very crusty bread, they provide butter but also have very high quality olive oil on the table to use.  My husband started the house made pasta that had pieces of veal osso bucco threw it in a well made sauce. He just kept saying this is really good.  I started with a light arugula salad. The salad was small but not too small , the salad was dressed nicely and was fresh.  I went with the Branzino since it was flown in yesterday. The fish was so fresh you almost tasted the seawater in it. My meal was cooked to perfection and the lemon white wine caper sauce just danced in my mouth and showed the skill of a trained chef. I picked the green beans as my side and they were cooked threw but crisp, lightly buttered and came out the most beautiful emerald green color.  My husband had the pork chop, the waiter didn't ask how he'd like it prepared but it came out perfect. The pork chop was lightly breaded and topped with prosciutto and fontina cheese. The sauce that the chop was in was in was also out of this world , very flavorful and made the dish special.  Like magic both dinners stayed piping hot till the last bite.  I didn't have any problems using my preferred Diner's Card getting me one meal for free. The gratuity gets added on when you use a card.  Maybe the menu and decor is a little Old Fashioned but the place is very neat and clean.   4.5 stars

The food we shared was INSANELY Good and Delicious but we had to make a phone call from the hostess desk to get seated after waiting for quite some time , but once we got seated SERVICE WAS VERY GOOD .  We shared the Summer Salad , and this was one of the most delicious salads I ever tasted . The unique taste of toasted coconut , fried shallots , fruit with that special secret dressing that was so light but sort of sweet and tasty then leaving  a spicy but not too spicy heat in the back of your mouth was wonderful and multi dimensional .  I never had Pad Gra Paow ( their spelling ) before so I can't compare this dish to other places but at Satara this was OUTSTANDING , the sauce was so CRAZY GOOD you could pour it on anything and it would be devoured . We ordered the Pad Gra Paow with chicken that was also delicious white meat that was a good ratio to the vegetables .  Dishes that I tried here were all very good to Great , plates can be shared ,  on Sundays bottles of wine are half price .   4-5 stars  slight update 1-1-12 retried the Pad Gra Paow, it differed and wasn't as wonderful but still good. 3-5 stars.  UPDATE- They've changed ownership since my review.

It's pains me to give Ko'sin two stars but that only means I've experienced better.  I picked the Chicken breast dinner.  The Chicken was DRY!  The fingerling potato hash didn't seem like fingerling's or potato hash and was ORANGE and pureed with HARD CHUNKS in it.   The mushroom fondue WAS THICK AS PUDDING and had a RING of melted BUTTER around it. This fondue was heavy with lots of flour butter and cream tasted like ultra thick salty cream of mushroom soup.  My husband ordered the pork porterhouse medium rare but it came out Almost Well Done.  His fingerling potato coins were hard and under cooked.  We were checked on after we were finished.  At the price point two stars is accurate.   Ko'sin is a distance from the Wildhorse, a shuttle bus runs about every fifteen minutes  and it is approximately a seven minute ride to the restaurant.

Located in the beautiful Phoenician Resort is the J & G Steakhouse. The inside is very clean shiny dark wood walls done in a contemporary way. Plenty of large windows to view the city and also a patio with fire pits.  The restaurant features more items than just steaks and the menu is accented with French and Asian Accents. Signature Items are recommended.  The Tuna Tartare (a signature item) might have been the best Tuna Tartare I ever had. Unless Tuna is really good I don't enjoy it raw but this was truly delicious. The fish was sweet and fresh and the textures of the Avocado were just right. The Ginger Marinade made it pop with the just right flavors.   The Black Truffle Cheese Fritters are very additive. They were only marble sized put packed a delicious mouthful. I could have eaten them all by myself. They had this very thin shell that tasted kind of like a yummy potato chip and the inside tasted like it was filled with like an Italian seasoned parmesan cream taste with truffles to me. It was a bomb of delicious flavors.   I had the Fresh just flown in that day sautéed Grouper with Spaghetti Squash. The Fish had a tasty nice seasoned crust and was flaky and moist inside. it sat in a sesame miso broth dotted with chili oil that didn't over power the fish. The spaghetti squash just soaked up the sauce.  My husband had the 19oz. Rib Eye with a side order of the Brussels Sprouts and the Black Pepper condiment. The steak was prepared MR as he requested. I tasted a small piece and it seemed on par with other steak houses but the Black Pepper Condiment was really Outstanding. I could tell a lot of work went into it. The sauce tasted like  combination of reduced beef confit onions with black pepper to me. It takes all day to make that kind of sauce.  I love brussels sprouts and pecans and aged balsamic but they didn't have that yum factor to me or to my husband. They weren't bad just OK.  We decided to try the Apple Crumble for dessert. It was as tasty as an apple crumble can be with a refreshing big hit of cinnamon and the creamy cinnamon ice cream went just right with it. It delicious but more homestyle than I was expecting.  If you have a Scottsdale/Phoenix Preferred Dining Card you can use it here.  Great Ambiance  Signature items have the WOW Factor

It's a shame this great tiny Cuban Place didn't remove the former Mexican Restaurant's sign with the name Bisteces. Also the old Mexican Food Bisteces Sign is still on one side of the shopping center too so if your looking for this place the Bisteces sign might still be up.   This very casual place is very tiny and only has 5 or 6 tables.  We started with the Papa Rellenas (fried mashed potatoes with a tangy seasoned beef center) I didn't know that they would be so large and the size of grapefruits since they were only $3.45 and they gave us two of them. This variation wasn't breaded and seemed lighter than others. The beef inside was very flavorful but not hot with spice.  I had the Pollo de la Plancha that is basically pounded chicken breast seasoned with lime  garlic and onions. The plate didn't look very attractive but the chicken was moist and very flavorful. They gave me an extra generous portion of rice with it and the plate was garnished with a light salad. ($6.99)  My companion had the Ropa Vieja. The beef was very flavorful but not hot with spice.  He found some bay leaves in his Rice and Beans. We've seen at some other Cuban Restaurants that when you find a bay leaf in your Rice and Beans it's like a prize and you get a free drink. I doubt they do that here as I didn't ask but it might be a fun thing to know. ($7.99)  The only thing I didn't like was if you need a restroom you have to walk threw a work area.  Someone from Yelp needs to remove the Mexican food reviews from Bisteces from this place.   I think the food from here will appeal to most people.

This Filipino Food was very good and I think most people can find something they like here because we tried three different meats and a tofu dish and all were different all were cooked nicely with good developed flavor. Nothing was spicy or aggressively seasoned and nothing tasted Chinese or Thai that I tried to me but everything we tried had a rich developed flavor. Portions are large prices are very low I think our combo plates were about $6.99 each.  This place is VERY CASUAL and is set up sort of like Panda Express. You decide on the kind of plate you want just like at Panda and point to what you want on your plate by looking at the food line or you can order from the pictures on the wall. Next you pay and seat yourself and clean up your tray when you leave.   I picked a combo plate so I could try two things. I picked Coconut Chicken and Tofu with vegetables. Both my picks looked familiar like Chinese or Thai dishes to me but neither of them had the seasonings I thought they'd be but the food was still tasty and good. The Chicken was very moist and had great developed flavor from being slow cooked on the bone but they didn't brown the skin so I found the skin unappetizing and had to remove it. That is my only criticism.  My husband tried the pork adobo and one of the beef dishes. He said both were very tender and tasty and he'd come here again.  This was a fun adventure it was like traveling the world.

we ate here once but not recently and it wasn't so great.  approx $40 for crummy sushi and no drinks..bah...but today they were featured on Channel 5 dirty dining with 7 health code violations I was actually going to retry them but now I think I will  continue to stay away As a SLIGHT update they have been on dirty dining a number of times since my first yelp. You need to check up on current situation.  8-21-14 Someone messaged me and told me new ownership. I will update in the future.

I heard that Kawaii was under new ownership and recently had a perfect Maricopa Health Inspection so I thought I could give Kawaii another try.  We ordered the most common of sushi to try that should be fresh.  A Salmon Surprise Roll and Sushi of Tuna and Yellowtail.  When the sushi came out I knew immediately  that this was not pristine fresh as it should be. (see close up of Yellowtail Photo)   Honestly I never had sushi anywhere that looked that bad including budget buffets.  I took a chance eating the sushi.  The sushi was put loosely together and most of the pieces fell apart when we ate them.   The tuna and yellowtail pieces weren't seasoned under the fish as they should be.  Really the worst tasting of the sushi was the salmon surprise roll. It was the only one that had an actual raw fish taste to it. I guess raw fish taste was the surprise.  None of the sushi really tasted fresh.   I only like fresh sushi.  This sushi I didn't like and is why some people won't eat sushi.  A while latter our stomachs ached but we didn't get sick.   If they didn't have any fresh fish the server should have suggested a stir fry to me.  BYE BYE KAWAII AND SAYONARA!  I WILL NOT BE BACK!

I don't truly think of this restaurant as a two star establishment as the food in general really was mostly very good but too many things went wrong. I had an excellent experience a few years back at the Chef's other restaurant Nob Hill but Nob Hill is gone now so I thought I'd try American Fish.  One of the things that went wrong was the oil I received with the delicious breads. The oil had a garlic slice that was baked onto the plate so I know it has been threw the dish washer at least once because of how hard it was baked on. We brought this to the attention of our server and he gave us a proper oil with a fresh garlic slice that floated and butter.  Both starters were delicious. I had a Ceaser Salad that was made with Kale. The Kale didn't appear to be massaged but was still easy to eat with the tasty dressing and cheese. They added two breaded fish called smelt fries that were a very tasty treat. My husband had the shrimp and grits and he said it was very good. I enjoyed my salad but I do note the sign outside said it was made with Romaine and not Kale.  We receive our dinners and I notice right away it didn't match the description of the menu I was given inside the restaurant. At this time I didn't realize the menu outside differed from the menu the inside was using because they were VERY SIMILAR MENUS. And then THE BIG ONE HAPPENS my husband pulls a wrinkled piece of PLASTIC WRAP FROM HIS MEAL. So we have to tell the server our meal doesn't match the inside menu and we found plastic wrap in the food. So we eat at this point and honestly my fish had a nice wood smoked taste to it but it was slightly overdone but not enough to complain. My husband said his was very dry on one side but better on the other side. He tasted mine and said mine was better than his. For me I thought the roasted smoked were too smokey but they might be great for most people as I only like mild smoke flavors. The inside menu said that I would be getting Corvina with some sort of English peas but clearly I got smoked vegetables and possibly Sea Bass since the outside sign said sea bass.   The manager stopped by and apologized about the plastic wrap. He said the fish there isn't wrapped in plastic and he just didn't know how that happened. He offered  my husband another plate of food. My husband declined as he was nearly done.  We received two desserts that came with our meals. Both were delicious and I would recommend either. But since I now know the inside menus differed from the outside menu I can't say for sure what they really were. I don't know if the management didn't change the outside menu to the correct day or if the server just handed me the wrong menu.  When the bill came we were told the manager took off our cocktails.  It's a shame a very nice concept of a restaurant with good recipes.  I would have given 3.5 stars if all went well but based the 3.5 on the preparation of the fish.

The food we received clearly showed masterful techniques and was done with the finest ingredients with a touch of molecular gastronomy thrown in as well.  They offer you rolls one is studded with bacon and the other is a French loaf along with real herbed creamy butter and a special salt.  Next comes an amuse bouche ours was a raw salmon that went down fast.  The sashimi dish featured melon like I never tasted before I think they were compressed and delicious, very sweet with an almost crisp texture. I thought this plate looked stunning and part of the look were those buttermilk caviar beads. The beads did add a texture and had were there for attractiveness but for me they seemed strange but I still thought this was a good dish. I admit I'm not the biggest fan of molecular gastronomy.  We are suckers for truffle so we tried the slow poached farm egg. It came out all foamy and you had to break the egg yolk and smear it on the nicely seasoned toast they give you. I thought the flavor was spot on and really great but the texture of the white foam was odd and little like raw egg white to me.  I thought the Oro King Salmon was OUTSTANDING. The fish seemed carefully sous vided and then seared. It truly melted in your mouth like butter. The marinated fancy tomatoes were flavorful and sweet. I enjoyed the carefully seasoned yellow squash that was cut into linguini noodle shapes. I didn't recognize the eggplant in the dish but it must have been the sage laced sauce on my plate. I was pleasantly surprised by the tasty use of snow pea tops in this dish. This dinner would have been better on a smaller plate because it was almost lost on the very large plate they put it on.  Wagu Short Rib was a winner.  We tried the corn dessert. It was very unusual and lacked sweetness.  Then we received an amuse bouche of hot white chocolate coffee.  Service was efficient and kind.

As guest we felt like a burden instead of welcomed and we found the foods  we tried as one dimensional and under seasoned , flat and the dessert awful . Maybe they just weren't in the working flow of things yet or maybe it just was an off night I don't know.  The door was wide open at 5:25 so we walked in and the hostess told us to make a reservation for 5:30 and to leave and come back in a few minutes . We thought that seemed odd but thought it was just because she was very young and figured that was all it was and came back a few minutes latter .  Too start with I received a white lint filled napkin on top of my black pants , but I did notice they have black linen napkins they use for the wine bottles.   We felt uncomfortable the whole time dining because most of the time I saw up to eleven members of staff were standing across from us with their backs against the wall just looking out into our direction . I glared at them a few times but they didn't budge .  We started with the tuna susci -described as marinated vegetables with preserved truffles , everything was raw and everything had little taste.  We shared the short rib agnolotti , that were like mini raviolis filled with short rib that had a baby food texture inside the well made pasta. Maybe ten percent of the  agnolottis we topped with a scant amount of toasted  crumbs slightly laced with horseradish for flavor that were resting in some browned butter.  The black cod although cooked nicely would have been forgettable but was not , only because of the concentrated tomato that I found interesting .  this dish was extremely mild and under seasoned with a few pieces of fennel that were nicely caramelized .  My husband had the duck breast and he said it was his least favorite one he ever had since the skin wasn't crispy and also lacked flavor , he thought it wasn't seasoned at all .  We had a little time to kill before the show so we thought maybe dessert might be good . We ordered the zeppole I don't mean to be mean or disrespectful but honest to God they tasted just like the chocolate muffins of the Sweet Tomatoes salad bar buffet , the zeppole were bread like , not sweet , almost not chocolate flavored and only a few zeppole not all had essence of nutella in them .   At this price range they don't have this much room for error.

I get upset often at this store. While the employees seem very nice and are always more than helpful. Over and over this store has many problems. Often I don't get the sale price on purchases and have to drive back since I don't catch it while they are ringing it up. Many times I've seen out of date products on the shelf and sometimes I accidentally purchase some of them. One time I went in to buy limes and all the limes had mold on them.(my picture is terrible and I couldn't capture all the mold)  I did speak to the manager about it and he said the limes were fine when you wipe the mold off and then he was at the limes wiping off the mold.  YESTERDAY in the meat department they had large packs of beef with stickers on them that said 96% and I could tell just by looking at them that it wasn't. Then I noticed the price sticker said 80% I brought this to the attention to someone from the meat department and instead of fixing the packs he told me that the meat was OK.   I don't think that's OK. Some people do have health issues and need to have the correct fat content.  Sadly The near by Fry's is even worst and I haven't been there in over a year since I kept buying spoiled meat from them and that is why I can't give this place one star.

The Special Bastille Day Menu WAS PHENOMENALand far from ORDINARY It was FOUR COURSES paired with FOUR WINES for $59.00.  As I entered I noticed that this is a very tiny but cozy place and I recommend for you to make a reservation if you want to be seated inside with air-conditioning. I also noticed many people ordering Lamb. The Lamb looks really good here.  They started us off with these  piping hot fresh from the oven Gougers (Cheese Puffs) and they were oh so tasty and cheesy it seemed like they were just made.   Amuse Bouches of tasting spoons arrive with dehydrated garlic chips tomato fresh herbs and olive oil. They go down easy and quick.   We receive Yellow Tomato Consommé with Fresh Made Red Tomato Raviolis topped with a Olive Oil Cracker. It really was a labor intensive dish that was out of the ordinary. The true taste of the tomato came out in the most perfect light way. The Tomato raviolis had a perfect texture and really went well with the dish.  A delightful plate of Special French Charentais Melon Balls arrive. They were perfect spheres of melon goodness with not just shredded crab but whole pieces of real Dungeness Crab that were just prepared.  The melon wasn't ordinary melon it was high end melon and seasoned in a way that complimented it well.  The main entree was Butter Poached Cod that nestled in Herbed Lemon Bur Blanc Sauce. The Fish was fresh moist and it was topped with a jam made from local tomatoes and with topped with a dehydrated yellow cherry tomato. A solid very good dish.  The dishes we received were so perfect. The wine parings amplified the outstanding dishes and made the dishes seem even better.   I sort of feared tomato as a dessert since I had a similar exsperience someplace else having a great dinner but an awful tomato desert. I sort of think Tomato is the one ingredient that should never be desert. The Desert was described as Tomato Trifle. I was game and was willing to try it. Thankfully   what we each received were tomato slices sandwiched with layers of creamy mild non tangy goat cheese with a yummy not too sweet but salted shortbread kind of cookie.  Service to every detail was outstanding.  I note they added a 21% Gratuity on our bill and I didn't ask but am guessing they did because of the special menu. I didn't have a problem with that as service was Outstanding and the food was beyond my expectations.

I do note  PHOENOMINAL excellent service by the waitstaff and manager and waitstaff that wasn't even ours. They did truly work as a team. Our group was made to feel Welcome Here.  I guess I have to start with the breadsticks. They give you bunches of them like it's raining breadsticks. Not all but most of the people at my table liked them but I thought they tasted a frozen dough product. One bite was enough for me as I didn't taste real garlic or a tasty oil on them.  The salad was sort of average with a what seemed like bottled dressing on it. They give you all you want and grate cheese on it for you.  I had the Apricot Chicken that's on the new Healthy Menu. The chicken wasn't as bad as that spongy Subway kind of chicken. I'm not sure if it was precooked and reheated or just over marinated because of the odd texture. It didn't taste fresh cooked but might have been. It seemed like it was cooked in a press of some sort. The asparagus and broccoli were nice and fresh but 100% unseasoned and just steamed. This dish tasted salt free and was slightly sweet.  My husband had a Shrimp and pasta dish. The shrimp were the small ones and the pasta was overdone.  I'd say if you are a fan of frozen TV dinners you will love the food here because it's a notch better with excellent service.

This is the Whole Foods version of a Dog Supermarket. They specialize in "Natural" , "Organic and "Holistic"  Dog Foods. It's not cheap to shop here just like Whole Foods (whole pay check) but that is because your buying  specialized , less ingredient , natural items that cost more.     The salesperson they had on asked me what I was looking for and showed me several options. He was extremely knowledgeable about all the ingredients in the packages and explained why some were better than others.   They do dog dental cleaning here for $150.00 with no sedation. I haven't had my dog's teeth done here so I can't say if it's good or not but I can tell you that is a nothing to bark at price for dog teeth cleaning.   Dog rescues set up here on the weekends.  They are conveniently near to AJ's where you can buy $40.00 a pound halibut and $40.00 a pound mushrooms.  I based my 4 stars rating on comparing to another smaller similar dog food store in the area that offers much less at similar prices.

I was very pleased with my first visit to Cafe China. The first thing you notice is that the restaurant is immaculately clean. The second thing you notice is how pleasing the staff are to you and thirdly the food is solid good.  I tried the chicken coconut curry. The chicken was moist and had a good ratio of vegetables. They made it a perfect spice level for me. It was unlike any curry that I've tried at other Chinese Restaurants so it wasn't what I expected but it was good so that didn't matter. The curry here was more like a tasty light and thin Asian Brown sauce that was lightly curried and topped with some coconut.   My husband tried the Black Pepper Chicken. Again nicely cooked moist chicken with a good ratio of vegetables and it tasted the way this dish normally taste.  They use a combination of jalapeno peppers and chili flakes for heat in the dishes.  I liked that you can order brown rice here and they are accommodating to people who like spicy!  Cafe China is Good!

We pass this place all the time and wanted to try them since they do OK on the Maricopa Restaurant Inspections.  This place was very noisy with lots of foreign loud chatter.  The chairs are very uncomfortable but the food we had was good and did differ from the other Vietnamese we tried.  The chicken cabbage salad was extremely delicate and seemed to fresh thinly sliced to order. The chicken was moist white meat chicken that seemed like it was poached with lemongrass. Fresh mint and cilantro laced the salad and the dressing tasted refreshing with a citrus taste. The crushed peanuts really balanced the salad out. This was a very nice very light very fresh delicate salad.  My husband went with one of the Pho's. It was suppose to be one of the three meat pho's but it was missing the sausage and nobody informed us that it would be missing sausage. Anyway the only reason I can still give four stars is because my salad was very good and my husband said this pho here  even with it missing the sausage was much better than the other places we had pho at. He thought this place did put less meat in their pho than some other places but the taste of the broth was far more flavorful, layered and spicy. He really liked it.   Viet Kitchen is located in a shopping center with a Costco.

With the weather being so hot we wanted to have a lighter meal and Viet Kitchen didn't disappoint. I noticed the menu looked different since the last time I was here but I think they offer most of the same things they offered before.   They didn't have much of a description on the menu for chicken and greens but I thought whatever it is sounded like something I'd want to try so I did. It wasn't listed under the salads but it turned out to be a cold salad served with a delicious mound of seasoned sticky rice. The salad was very refreshing and just right for a hot day. It was made with flavorful infused poached white meat chicken that was ultra moist and very fresh tasting.  Instead of salad greens the greens of this salad seemed to be shaved cucumber and fresh cilantro, it was light refreshing and tasty.   My husband tried the one soup called Hot and Spicy. He said it was good but very spicy and didn't have all the flavors of Pho as it wasn't Pho.  The chairs didn't seem as uncomfortable to me as they did last time maybe some are better than others?  This is the busiest Vietnamese Restaurant I've been too every seat was filled with people and most were Asian.  The atmosphere was loud and busy.  Didn't disappoint.

Since my last visit they got rid of the uncomfortable but pretty chairs and replaced them with comfortable cushioned chairs that are slightly too wide to fit the tables.  We started with Summer Rolls. They were much larger than I was expecting and also far more delicious than I was expecting. The beef inside had this delicious charcoal kind of taste and had very fresh vegetables around it in a rice paper wrapper. The fresh mint inside made it very refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day. The roll was also served with a light fish sauce.  I had the Spicy Stir-Fry. It wasn't as spicy as I was expecting but it had a nice kick to it. The white meat chicken was developed with flavors and was prepared very well. This dish had a wide assortment of fresh crunchy vegetables in it that was covered in a very balanced sauce. This WAS A VERY GOOD Dish and possibly one of the best dishes you can get anywhere for $7.25.  Out of all my visits so far I haven't been disappointed with anything I ordered from here.   I like that they offer many different things that I don't notice at other Vietnamese Restaurants.  The food seems very solid from here.

Now I know why President Obama skipped the Biltmore on his recent visit. He must have been informed about the Pork Belly and the Corned Beef from Frank and Alberts.  The atmosphere is mostly very impressive. It's very rich and airy. It's very cool Frank Lloyd Wright but with a retro diner kind of feel.  A few things about the atmosphere were not impressive. Dirty Salt and pepper shakers and crumbs on the floor. I also noticed bowls of tortilla chips just sitting out getting stale and dusty on the line the whole time we were seated.   I ordered the house made corned beef sandwich. When it arrived I thought it looked OK and took a bite. All I could taste was sauerkraut. Then I took a piece of meat out to try. It felt slimey and was very fatty. I cut off the fat and tasted the meat and it seemed corned but lacked the spices that flavor the meat. It was pretty tasteless and was just slimey and fatty. I gave a piece to my husband to try and he also said it seemed slimey to him and tasteless. I was hoping our waitress would check on us but she didn't.  I asked my husband how his Pork Belly BLT was. He said the porkbelly and roll was very dry, the bacon was good and the tomatoes were old. I didn't know how dry the porkbelly was until I got home and feed some to my dogs. It was the driest piece of meat I ever felt in my life. It was so dry that if you rubbed your skin with it you could cut yourself on it. I thought my sandwich was awful but after feeling that porkbelly I think his sandwich was worst and both sandwiches were served with cold fries.  We were NEVER checked on or asked how our meal was.  I know I should have found a manager to complain to but sometimes you just get so bummed you don't feel like it. This was suppose to be an extra special meal out at an exceptional place. These sandwiches cost about $16.00 each. Fortunately I have a Scottsdale Preferred Card and had one meal off the check but even if the meals were free they'd still be horrible.   I don't know if my exsperience is typical or not.  If you still want to give them a try after reading my review you have to do a valet park or park yourself in the garage that's around a little way from the restaurant.

This Thai Restaurant offers many items that I haven't seen before on Thai Menus. We started with curry puffs. They were crispy won ton skins stuffed with marinated seasoned minced chicken and sweet potatoes. They were tasty but didn't remind me of curry....just tasty.  I had the chili eggplant with chicken. This dish was delicious! My chicken was tender and the sauce was bright, tasty and accented with lots of fresh herbs. For me it had all the right flavors going on. My husband had the sweet basil with beef. The beef was slightly chewy but the flavor of the sauce was good and this dish was infused with basil flavor like it should be. We both ordered our dishes HOT and they were perfect for us. Real pepper was used for heat and not powder like from some other Thai Restaurants.  Portions were good. I thought they were large for Thai.  They have sticky rice and brown rice on the menu.  Many seafood dishes are offered and they have FOUR kinds of fish on the menu.  At the time of this review they have these fun complimentary scratch off lottery type of tickets were everyone is a winner and you can get some money off your next order. (We both got $5.00 scratch offs)  Service was very friendly and the restaurant appeared clean.  Slight update......Feb-2016 Did take out and the food wasn't nearly as great.....Not sure....if they went down or just don't do take out well....

Being as nice as possible I have to say this is a below average Chinese Restaurant so I am rounding it UP to two stars  ONLY because of the extreme cleanliness and the attentive server .  I was going to order the Szechuan Chicken but the server informed me that they make it with fried chicken so I thought I wouldn't like it and ordered Vegetable Chop Suey instead . I couldn't watch them cook but heard almost no noise from the kitchen and my meal was out within a couple minutes  (maybe two?) . It seemed like the vegetables and rice were precooked and someone poured heated chicken stock over it . I am trying  NOT to to be mean but It seemed and tasted liked microwave cookery  . Most of the vegetables didn't seem like fresh ones like the awful canned bamboo shoots and the pre cut very possibly bagged broccoli , potato chip shape cut carrots with snow pea mix , but two fresh vegetables were the button mushroom and cabbage . Even the steamed ( steamed ?) rice didn't taste good , each rice grain was sort of dried out . (maybe old?)  My husband had one of the Beef Lunches that are mostly priced at $4.50 or $4.95 . It came out two or three minutes after mine and had the same vegetables but in a brown sauce that tasted very strong of uncooked beef base . The lunch menu includes soup , won ton  , and egg roll , The soup was very thick with too much corn starch and the won ton was EMPTY .   Maybe someone new was trying to cook that day .

The REAL deal for Korean Cuisine !  This is only the second Korean Restaurant I've been too and the other one seemed like  normal everyday American Food compared to here . The decor is a mix of Asia , Gilligan's Island , and a disco .  We started with the OH MY GOD if your looking for SPICY fish cakes with chili sauce and added assorted peppers appetizer dish . I wouldn't say #10 Thai hot but maybe almost a nine hot since the sauce had a nice sweetness to cut the heat . I am not 100% sure if we got what we ordered since neither of us recognized anything on our plate as fish but whatever it was it really did taste good . The what we think ( and hope ) were fish cakes looked like logs of gnocchi pasta but had an unusual texture that was chewy and light . I saw slices of what looked like beef through the platter but passed on trying since they were unknown to me but my husband ate them and said they were just beef . Our server was so HAPPY and enthusiastic we ordered this dish she actually JUMPED in the air for joy . I was afraid to ask if this was what we ordered since I also didn't want to know if it was something I would never eat .  I tried what was basically chicken on a sizzling skillet with vegetables in a sort of sriracha tasting sauce . This dish was good . We were given eight little dishes of pickled sides . I found it interesting that each side really did change the taste of the meal and the anchovies with peppers made the taste change to a Thai food taste and I liked that one the best until I saw heads on the tiny fish and had to stop with that one . My meal also came with a large bowl of fresh steamed sticky rice .  My husband had the beef rib soup . The soup came out SIZZLING really sizzling . The soup seemed like a beef stock with some sriracia added and in the middle of the soup was a big beef rib the soup also had crumbled tofu in it . The soup also came with a big bowl of rice .   Portions were big for sharing .

Tasting something delicious from a buffet  ANY BUFFET usually never happens because it is always at best just A-OK or not so good or a spit out . I tasted Mongolian beef that was absolutely delicious , beef ribs that were meaty and not fatty , tasty flavorful spicy white fish , juicy chicken sticks and bok choy that was sauteed with hand chopped fresh garlic and finished with a hot fresh donut . This is not the prettiest buffet and not the biggest but I would call it  take out quality . (if you are lucky enough to have good Chinese take out near your home) with good service .   I do note that all buffets change things up and HOPEFULLY the next selections will be just as tasty and fresh .  A chain Chinese Buffet will be opening almost next door behind Freddy's Custard that will be new and prettier but if the taste of good food from Shanghai is a world a part in difference .

I don't get blown away too often when I go out to dinner but I did here. EVERYTHING we tried was PREPARED TO PERFECTION, SEASONED WONDERFULLY and each dish was UNIQUE and INTERESTING and mostly unlike dishes I've tried at other places.  The only problem we've encountered was deciding on what to order since they had SO MANY INTERESTING dishes on the menu. so we ordered several plates.  We started with crispy chick peas, the famous award winning Leek dish and the I hope this one stays on the menu, Beet Falafel plate. All were excellent. I had the Leek dish before so I knew it would be good but the Beet (yes beet) Falafels were MIND BLOWING CRAZY GOOD with the surprise dips. Both dips were VERY GOOD but that  spicy red dip really was awesome. To me that falafel plate should be an award winner.  For dinner I had the Corvina. For sure this was one of the very best fish dishes I've had in Arizona. I think if you THINK you don't like fish you would like fish it you had it as well prepared and as fresh as what I had here it really was that good.  My husband had the brontosaurus sized Pork Shank that had this really perfect crust on it. I think it was GENIUS of Chef Charleen to pair it with watermelon radish kim chi and bok choy. BTW the kim chi was better than some I've tried out at Asian Restaurants.  We didn't need dessert but wanted to try one anyway since it was such a home run. I don't remember what he called it but it was some sort of chocolate cake with a chocolate mousse center on top of a very dark chocolate sauce. It seemed very light but I know it wasn't. I wasn't a problem to eat anyway.  With out a doubt Among the BEST and most Interesting that the Valley offers.  I will have to dine here more often.

We always order too much food here because everything in so darn good. I am hooked on the falafels so I have to order whatever one they offer since that first beet falafel I tried. Since then I had the Swiss Chard Falafel and this last one was the spring green Falafel. All were great and yummy I can't wait to get the next one. Instead of a salad we shared the Broccoli with tangerine aioli and pistachios. It was delicious and it was the first time my husband ever ate aioli because he is very anti mayo but he said it was good.  My husband ate the shrimp appetizer he said the shrimp were cooked perfect and he really enjoyed them.  I had the Halibut and I have to say it might have been the best halibut I ever had. It was so tasty and juicy with great flavor from the wood grill. It was served over a cous cous that was studded with fava beans , tomatillios , fancy almonds and rainbow heirloom carrots and then topped with pretty purple micro sprouts. It all tasted really good together and this was the first time I ever had chopped up fresh tomatillos in a dish in this way it worked really well.  My husband had the lamb chops he said it was the best lamb he ever had!  Dinner was a big home run and the poppy seed tangerine cake sounded too good to resist to we had to try it. The cake was topped with mascarpone cream and cherries. I didn't like the taste of the cream by itself but on the cake it was delicious and this was one of the best desserts I ate this year so far.  I'll be having my five star leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Woohoo!

Vegetables get transformed into something you never thought they could be. Who knew a (Gilfeather) Rutabaga could be more delicious than a baked potato? Who knows that Meyer lemon tahini with cumin and Grapefrut makes sweet carrots delightful? The Chef at FnB Knows that Miso Butter, Almonds, and Crispy Onions makes Butternutnut Squash something special.  I've been here many times and not only do I get a delicious meal but I find my dining exsperience educational too as I always learn something about vegetables I didn't know before. I learned from FnB that Harissa makes spaghetti squash something unexpected and wonderful. That Roasted till creamy and then crisped Rutabager really pops from Ginger Creme Fraiche.  Food & Wine Magazine Named FnB's Braised Leeks, Mozzarella, Fried Egg & Mustard Bread Crumbs Dish Award Winning.  The Chef has been nominated for a James Beard Award!  The food is excellent just go and get your Veg On!

I didn't dine in the place but I did get delivery . For the most part I am not a fan of freaky weird pizzas and I prefer them traditionalism you might think different .   We ordered two basic pizzas to share....and both of us didn't like the crust...weird tasting sweet wheat....    both of us didn't like the sauce....like ketchup .   I note the cheese was actually good but this variation of pizza is not for pizza lovers

Thai Spices is THAI-RIFIC!  Yelper Mark R. periodically posts these scrumptious looking photos on Yelp from Thai Spices so I thought I'd have to check this place out when I'm by this area and I'm glad I did as my experience was VERY GOOD!  We started with tasty Sweet Potatoes appetizer. They came out very thinly dipped and didn't seem oily at all. The kind of potato they used almost had a sweet chestnut like flavor and was very good. They came with sweet and sour sauce that was OK but a little sweet for my taste.  My husband had the Thai Spices Basil with the added option of making it Thai Style with Chopped Ground Chicken and Crispy soft fried egg. The chicken in the dish was moist and flavorful and the fried egg was excellent. It had a thin crisp all around it and a soft center that oozed it's richness into the dish like it should. This was a much better variation of this dish than I had at several other places in the valley. However I did think this dish needed more basil and would ask for extra basil next time we are here.  I am a sucker for anything pumpkin in a Thai Restaurant so I had to order the Pumpkin Tofu Curry. This variation did differ from others I've tried but was still very good. This version was vegetarian and made with red curry. It had a silky richness to it from the pumpkin with only just a few tasty pumpkin chunks in it. The vegetables in it were cooked just right and the tofu was nice and helped to lightened this dish. I do note the portion was very small but it was delicious and I had enough anyway.  Service was friendly and efficient.  A very SOLID 4 stars   THAI-RIFIC! Located in Mekong Plaza

You take a long beautiful stroll to enter the restaurant and pass by the singing dancing Christmas Tree to get you in the spirit ( if you come during the Christmas Season ) . The tree was a light show with Christmas tunes .  We started with house margaritas they were good and large and we shared a plain queso fundido . The fundido was a lot of melted cheese with butter and came with three warmed flour tortillas . Fundido is very filling and might be best for a group of people .  My waiter said the very best dish that La Hacienda does with out a doubt is the Braised Beef Short Rib so I ordered it and he was right ! The rib was flavorful and nicely crusted , the vegetable escabeche on top cut the richness of the beef and the chile guava sauce was delicious . Creama potato puree completes the meal with all the flavors in harmony . The portion is also large the rib is a double rib and my leftovers made two lunches . (this dish alone was five stars)  My husband had the slow roasted pork shoulder it came with roasted corn puree and pumpkin seed sauce and said it was very good .  We had no problems using our preferred restaurant card and received one dinner for free . Service was professional and way above average making our visit a 4.5 stars .

It pains me to down grade them a few stars but this last experience was disappointing.  I do note we did stop in for happy hour this time and really enjoyed the $5.00 margaritas and $5.00 mini tacos but I don't judge places by their happy hours because Happy Hours are usually happy anyway.  We had a really great dinner here last year and thought we would again. It's a BEAUTIFUL ATMOSPHERE here and they have beautiful Christmas Tree and Ice skating at the Princess.   For Dinner I was going to try the Grouper or the Pistachio Crusted Tuna this time but to my surprise they took them off the menu and replaced them with a Tempura Battered Fish. (website needs an update)  Why would I order Tempura at a Mexican Place? So I went with the Skirt Steak.   OK I didn't like anything on my plate. The steak wasn't tasty. It looked OK but just didn't taste good. I guess it needed some salt and pepper. I should have asked for salt and pepper. It was just soggy beef and also was like chewing just cow and not a tasty steak. I didn't like the potato gratin because it also needed salt and potatoes don't taste good unless they are salted. I didn't like the enchilada because of the horrible thick mole sauce. This was the worst mole sauce I've ever tasted in my life and if it was my first time with mole sauce I'd never touch it again. The sauce wasn't balanced and was thick and too much chocolate and it turned my stomach. I do note the table salsa was seasoned nice and the bar foods we tried were made nice so I know you can get good food here.  My husband ordered the short rib that I had last time. The rib this time was OK but not great like the one I had last time. This time it didn't have the really tasty crust on it and the portion size was much smaller. The rib was just passable and not made with the really great care like last time. But my husband felt really bad when he tasted my plate and told me I could have his instead since it was better.  A very nice manager did check on us and offered to get me something to fix my meal and it was before I knew what was wrong with what I was tasting. I told her it was just OK.  Last time they weren't busy and the food was very good. This time they were very busy and that might or might not be  factor in this last experience. I received my meal for free since I have a preferred diners card.

This is a family (Jordanian Back round) owned and operated store with over 30 years  Food experience from Chicago .   The Owners are MORE THAN NICE as they are cheerful friendly and offered me a taste of the exotic produce such as green almonds and tiny green plums that look like green cherries how interesting and rare is that !  The Foods we tried were Great and Flavorful . We had the vegetarian plate #2 and beef kabob platter .  The hummus and babaghrooj (I used same spelling as menu) were so neat and pretty with a tasty oil dip built in and some sort of grind-ed  mildly spicy pickled green pepper in the middle,these were the most delish I've had and the felafel's were so light but crispy on the outside  I wasn't sure if they were made with fava beans or a combo since they were green and the tahini sauce was the very best I've ever had all these were seasoned so perfect that is what made them so good . The beef kabob plate was great too great tasty beef nicely cooked onions and peppers with rice ,pita and a salad .  We had to share one of their desserts it was a tiny pastry filled with pistachios and dipped in chocolate.  This place is not fancy but it appears to be clean . This is a Halal so no pork is in this market . This is (almost fast casual but you do eat on real plates the food is made fresh to order a few minutes) and it is very reasonably priced .  This Place is FIVE STARS Special if you are open to this kind of food you will agree .

OUTSTANDING semi quick Very Casual not fancy Mid East/ Greek style Grill.  I've been pleased with everything I tried here over the years and the Olive Tree Market & Grill is really at the TOPS for a Grill of it's kind and it's a must stop to kind of place if you are in the area.  The falafels are among the best in the valley and the sauces and dips are outstanding. They bake at least one of the breads in house I think it was the pitas. The salad here is the BEST I've had at any of these kind of places by a long shot. Kabobs are delicious and I like their shawerma more than others I've tried. Portions are large and prices are low. The food has always been fresh.  They sell some produce and hard to find jarred and dry items and lots of variety of bulgur including the whole grain style.  The owners are exceptionally nice and sweet you are always made to feel very welcome here.  A Gem in this area for sure.  4.5 stars

The Cosmopolitan is NEARLY PERFECT in every way. It's beautiful accented with crystal glam glitter and mesmerizing  hypnotic walls of strange moving pictures. They are in a really GREAT location and have and are very close to many VERY fine restaurants, shops and casinos and also a few that aren't so fine too and of course the Secret Pizza and SO MUCH MORE!  I enjoyed most of my accommodations in my stay at the Cosmopolitan.  Comfortable Bed, Good toiletries, Easy to work nice shower.  But I need to mention we were erroneously charged for a snack from the mini bar. My husband noticed it on the online system and called. Right away they removed the charge from our bill. OK I guess that happens not a big deal as it was corrected right away.  We weren't able to do the online check out because it was down. Again not a big deal as we were able to check out on the phone.                   MY ONLY COMPLAINT is I feel the furniture in my room wasn't as clean as it should be. I've included photos of the suspicious stains on the desk chair and the different kind of suspicious stains on the sofa.   That is the reason why I can't give this Beautiful over the top high end Gorgeous Property Five Stars.

The Jidori Brick Chicken sounded really good but it came out dry. The chicken didn't seem freshly made and the skin on top was like a sheet of rubber. I've cooked chicken and froze and reheated chicken before and it never comes out this dry. How do you make a leg of all things dry? My waiter did check on us and I informed him about the chicken being dry but that was that. I do have to say the mushrooms and corn under the chicken were outstanding, I did enjoy them. The potatoes tasted like box potatoes but might have been fresh?  My husband had the veal osso bucco and he said the veal was dry and disappointing but the gnocchi were good and light.  I don't know if they were having a bad day or if they are like this all the time. My husband was here before and thought the wild boar ragout was really good here before but the waiter talked him into trying the osso bucco that was dry.  Wolfgang needs to spend less time on the shopping channel and more time in his restaurants.

The most delicious Thai Dish I ever tried was the Spicy PUMPKIN Basil with chicken from Lao Thai. That Kabocha Squash (Japanese Pumpkin) has the taste of a chestnut mixed with sweet potato. The sauce is a very balanced sauce with perfect spice heat the right amount of sweetness and flavors to knock you out. We also had the Pad Ga Pow and that one was good as well.  Lao Thai uses Thai Chilies in their dishes instead of jalapenos for a more authentic taste and features many spicy dishes and also seafood. I do need to mention the portion we just had was smaller than other places and had less protein so if you need  leftovers this is not for you.  Lao Thai is among the cleanest of restaurants I've been in. It was a pleasure dining here.

I don't know if Lao Thai is the best Thai out there but Lao Thai is the best Thai I've been too. I don't judge Thai food by the green curry dish or the pad Thai but by the dishes that I find interesting and of course taste and food execution.  I've had three very good experiences here so far.  The one dish that is so darn tasty is the Spicy Pumpkin Basil and that dish is so tasty I have a very hard time ordering something else. I've had this same dish at other places and nobody makes this one dish as well as Lao Thai. The pumpkin is very hard to get right and not over do or under do. The sauce is always delicious and the chicken is always perfect.  This time we also had an appetizer and tried the Beef wrapped asparagus. It was also so tasty I don't think there is a person out there that wouldn't like it.  My husband had the Spicy Egg Bomb. He said it was the very best Thai he ever had and also said the pumpkin basil was so good he would also be happy with that as well. I do note the egg was not as runny as it should have been.  The food for us was a perfect spicy level and I do note it might be too spicy for some people .  I liked that they have brown rice as an option.  I liked that the place is meticulously clean.  And I liked that service was always fast and efficient.  4.5 stars

Richardson's is New Mexican Cuisine and is similar to Mexican and Tex Mex but is slightly different. The Big Things here are the Potato stuffed green chile and the do you want Red or Green Chile Sauce question.  I tried the Santa Fe Chicken. It came out on a very large ornate silver platter. I have to say everything on my plate was delicious! The chicken was pecan grilled and was very moist and flavorful. It was topped with sautéed mushrooms and Jalapeño hollandaise sauce and served over tasty garlic toast. It was delicious as it was but I though it was shy with the jalapeño. I had my choice of side and went with the house specialty Potato stuffed Green Chile. It had some heat to it but not too much and was delicious. Also on my plate was a very large salad that was mostly cheese. For me it was WHEY too much cheese but the salad was fresh and lightly dressed with a very thin white dressing.  My husband tried the New Mexican Enchiladas. He had a trio of pork, chicken and beef Christmas Style with Red and Green Chile Sauce also filling the plate was rice and beans. He said everything was seasoned nice and everything tasted different and his plate was also very generous with LOTS OF CHEESE.  Based on this one exsperience the food seems solid but you'll need to cheddar a few pounds if you eat all the cheese.  You Cheddar believe it.

An Affair not to be missed .   Besides the Amazing participating restaurants of the valley it really was a party as we ran into friends and also great live music such as Rodger Clyne and you could walk around the Art Museum included .   not all but many restaurants had a few different things to try some were like buffets on their own also it was almost like a culinary trade show not like a Costco sample demo , the restaurants put out quality representations of their work   La Grande Orange or Cibo (shaved brussel sprout salads,pepperoni pizza , Kai (quail egg w/bacon on top of a tiny french toast,chocolate & pork) Petite Masion (seafood ball) Cowboy Ciao (bite size ice cream sandwich) Narcisse Champagne & Tea Lounge (pepidew pepper cheese crosstini) Short leash( not only dogs but fried pickles) St Frances (cauliflower soup)  too many others to mention .   Pork belly was everywhere offered to eat and on people attending .   almost never more than 3 people before you waiting  Terrific wines some were Stags Leap , Etude , and AZ wineries .   Some foods were also butlered to people attending , bottled water everywhere .   only one place didn't prepare food ok...you could get sick from it becauce it was cooked meat that was raw and ice cold inside .  next year will bring sunscreen burnt today .

Did you know it was $79 for walking in the door for one day or the way in advance tickets were $90 for TWO DAYS not just one day.  You really couldn't go wrong picking either day both were Great! You didn't have to wait long anywhere and water was provided for you. Many Area Restaurants participated and tried to impress you with tastings to razzie and dazzle you.  On Saturday many offered good salmon but the one who nailed it was Switch Restaurant with a seared salmon unlike anyone's with a polenta cake arugula salad and a tiny Parmesan cheese crisp.  The most beautiful eye popping salad came from St Francis Restaurant with greens I never saw before so colorful, so many textures words can not describe.  Heirloom Beets were popular and District American Kitchen had them in a easy to eat  cone salad with strawberries that was very good and North also had them in a salad with house made ricotta and fennel.  Maizie's  Cafe cooked up some real corned beef Reuben's on a marble rye.  Some wineries and breweries were represented and one highlight was Mary Edwards with a very good Russian River Valley Pinot Noir conveniently located near all the Salmon.  The one dessert that wowed me was the gold dusted lemon raspberry macaroon from The Four Seasons.  On Sunday Kobe sliders and Turkey apple sliders from Relish.  The best pork might have came from Barrio Queen and her side of corn in a cup was so tasty anyone would agree.  The Breadfruit made great seasoned Mussels (who knew?)  Large shrimp in chili oil came from the House of Tricks.  Maybe the best prepared fish was the Steal head Trout from Kai it just melted in your mouth.  I wasn't in a head cheese mood so I didn't try the fancy looking plate of head cheese from Petite Maison but I'd guess it was good.  Short Leash dogs had a mini buffet spread of hot dogs.  Tuck Stop had good muffulettas and Tammie Coe had very tasty Crack Cake.  Betty's Nosh had several of their popular mushrooms and a yummy light custardy light carmel bread pudding.  I couldn't mention everything that was good more more was. Only one place I thought didn't do well preparing food in an out door environment all the meats were over cooked and dry. The only downside was some things that I liked the most I didn't see offered on the restaurant's menus that they came from.

Several places both days ran out of food EARLY like by 1:00 both days and it was packed like sardines due to less space from construction but as per usual many of the best of the valley showed up to offer you their best. This year the price was about $70. for one day or about $100. for two days.   I thought it would be another year of pork belly after pork belly but this year it started to look like it might be a year of Burrata Cheese since I saw it at three eateries the first day but it wasn't. Pork over the course of two days was the big protein I think followed by beef and then shrimp. I only remember seeing just one chicken dish in the two days. They offered endless desserts but it seemed like less desserts than in past years. Great beers , Great Local wineries and Great non-local Wineries showed up. Bottled Water was provided, hand washing stations , hand sanitizer and clean restrooms.   Saturday  Of course I wasn't able to try as much as I wanted too due to stomach room and did miss out on many great things but I still managed to make a nice dent on the offerings.  The Avalon Gourmet put out a beautiful assortment of fine cheeses, crackers, pickles including a really tasty bread and butter kind of pickle that was sort of spicy but the crowning offering was the Iberico Ham that is made from some kind of rare black footed pig that only eats acorns and is sort of kissed by the lips of God. Well anyway this ham at Christmas time runs $75. for 4 oz. and the normal catalog price is $52. for just 4 oz. or you can buy it by the leg but that will cost you an arm and a leg. (Gourmetfoodstore.com) It was mighty generous for Avalon Gourmet to bring Iberico Ham to the party.  St Francis put out another jaw dropping pretty salad. I wonder if that salad is ever on their menu?  One of my favorite bites came from Milagro Grill. I don't know what it was called but it was a very tender nicely flavored piece of beef topped with vegetables siting on something horseradish on very thin corn something. The bite as a whole was very delicious.   I liked the Bite from Sushi Roku. It was something like sushi. It was spicy tuna over a tasty fried seasoned rice patty.  I appreciated the lighter foods that Tertio Wine Bar put out. I tried that Thai Style Cauliflower soup and the tasty light nicely seasoned eggplant. I thought it was nice to have lighter food in this kind of setting.  My husband was able to eat more food than me and really enjoyed the food from Cartwright's , it was Buffalo Sausage with Spatzle and said we need to go there for dinner. He also enjoyed the Porchetta Sandwich from Davanti and decided after a little time passed he wanted another one but sadly Davanti was out of sandwiches by 1:00.  We were at some places at the wrong time when they were having some kind of cooking problem. We hit T. Cook's when the lamb shanks were raw inside. We hit La Grande Orange when the pizzas came out black on the bottom. But we did notice after wards things looked like they were coming out right.  There was so much more and it was an overall great day!  Sunday  It was even harder for me to take pictures on Sunday because it was standing room only between the very big spreads from District American Kitchen , Kai , and the places in-between Gallo Blanco and Hanna. I thought much of the food from Kai was sweet and custardy . For me in that group the plate I took from Hanna I liked the best because I liked the very tasty just one bite of beef and the interesting light Sushi Slider with a lemon slice. My husband really liked the goat taco from Gallo Blanco he also thought the Raw Lamb Heart from Petite Maison was really layered with great flavors. I admit I wasn't brave enough to try goat or raw lamb heart.  The Tuna Crudo really knocked me out from Crudo and just next door was Blue Hound offering Wild Steal head that was light and tasty and I'm sorry I didn't ask what that vegetable was on it that looked like yellow grass but sort of tasted like corn.  Barrio Cafe also put out a very nice mini buffet.  Everything was great but I thought the shrimp with the tastiest slaw was the knock out dish. The Guacamole from Barrio is the only guacamole I've ever seen my husband eat. Sadly Barrio also closed up early I think 1:30.  Relish Burger Bistro put out pork tacos and bacon deviled eggs instead of burgers.  My husband liked the hot dog from Short leash that squirted out cheese and jalapeños but I noticed they had at least three different kinds out there.  Switch made an interesting Beignet with crab siting on slaw.  They were pouring many better wines I noticed that some were $100. bottles. I remember liking a Syrah I thought that came from Oregon and the Patz a Hall Pinot Noir and the Merry Edwards Pinot Noir.  We received many discount cards for many of the restaurants that participated in Devoured.  There is just so much I left out, can't wait to do it again.   It's a week of nonfat cottage cheese and nonfat yogurt for me now.

After making it to Devoured for a few years in a row now I can say they weren't at their finest this year to me. But still Good enough to be a five star event. General public tickets ran about $80 a day or a two day price of about $140. They offered a VIP option that got you in an hour before they opened and had some exclusive items just for VIPS. The VIP tickets cost $150. A DAY.  Last year were hundreds on intricate tiny desserts that were mesmerizing  when you waited to enter the event. This year were a few that seemed solid both days. Last year you could be dazzled by Iberico Ham that runs 50-70$ for just 4oz. This year you didn't see that! I didn't think Kai was as exciting this year or had as big of a spread as they usually do but they did prepare three different dishes.  I do note I didn't try everything but most things I tried were good only one dessert I thought was horrible but only a few main dishes were memorable. My husband tried many more things than I did and preferred different items than I did. Some restaurants I've visited and had their food before DEVOURED but when I tried the same here THEY DIFFERED. One for the better and the other not. The one Constant of places that I do go out to eat at was Los Sombrero's and the Trout was prepared tasting exactly the same as when I dined there 3x between their two locations.  I really enjoyed when the Chef from Hana took the time to explain to me her whole buffet she was serving and how to eat the food. Her Sea Bass was tiny and intricate and one of my favorite dishes of the two day event.  The tastiest small bites thing I ate was from Little Cleo's Seafood Legend. I wasn't sure if I would like it because I don't like smoke flavor too much but all together The buttery oozy seasoned Quail egg over the house made sturgeon with herb ed creme fraiche on toast was popping like magic in my mouth. Will it be that good when I visit that restaurant? Hope so.....  I don't get wowed by too much by a slab of beef it's just not that special to me and is very filling but one of the best I tried was from Roka Akor and it was only skirt steak however the shiso chimichurri sauce made it special.  The simple vegetables and dip from Phoenix Public Market was stunning. The Vegetable Terrine from Tertio Wine Bar was tasty and pretty and a bit zippy. I thought it was a very thoughtful dish among the mostly heavier foods offered.  One of the best desserts had to be from the Gladly. They did some sort of Whiskey Blondie that was delicious. I wasn't going to eat more than a tiny taste but it was one of the things I finished after sharing with my husband.  For my taste I enjoyed the wines most from Merry Edwards.  There is a lot that I left out....   OK not as Grand as last year but still well organized and the best of the area. Still five stars just on the lower end this year.

The food we had was delicious and far exceeded our expectations , since this was low priced.  They start you off with a complimentary cup of egg flower soup or a small fresh salad with peanut dressing.  We had Hot and Spicy Cashew Chicken and the Ginger Chicken Lunch Plates ($5.50@) Both were fresh and flavorful with a good meat to vegetable ratio and came with crispy vegetable roll and steamed rice shaped like a heart on your plate.   Besides YUMMY FOOD service was very good and We were HAPPY we stopped here !

I went here because of the certified dog friendly patio but was pleasantly surprised about really well prepared food.   I had the BBQ Salmon Salad. I don't know what kind of salmon they used but it sure tasted like Loch Duart. The fish was rich and creamy with rich flavor. This a very above average preparation of salmon. The salad underneath was nice and fresh tasting. I liked the fresh cut corn in the salad.  My husband had the lunch meatloaf platter and swapped out the garlic mashed for the house made potato chips. Everything on his plate was seasoned well. The meatloaf was delicious but a little mushy in texture.  Service was friendly and we were checked on often.  This is a small restaurant with a stylish but funky decor. The outside (dog friendly) patio is  large.   On this visit I didn't hear any rhythm from music nor did I indulge in wine but I did have a very nice lunch.

Rocket Burger & Subs is a very casual and divey. You won't get the most high end burger in the valley but you'll get 100% angus flat patties that are prepared to your likening  and are delicious with several choices of sizes and toppings. Besides burgers they offer sandwiches, subs, beef hot dogs, soft serve, floats and the biggest selection of bottled sodas I've ever seen. Portions are very large and prices aren't much more than fast food. You are getting food that's MUCH Better than fast food.  After watching RB&S on Check Please Arizona I went with what everyone else tried the popular NY Double Burger with fries. I liked that they carefully toasted the buns and the burgers were prepared medium just like I asked for and were juicy and tasty. A generous amount of tasty grilled pastrami and house made slaw and rocket sauce topped the burger. It was all good tasty and humungous and a giant amount of fresh cut fried potatoes were yummy too.   Check out Rocket Burger!  It's a Blast!

Interesting quaint and sort of shabby chic urban vibe .  At the moment this is a TEENY tiny place with maybe 6 tables and the tables are mostly two seaters but they will be expanding next door . I do find the menus are somewhat limited so check first on line is the menu suits you and parking is on street or the free garage almost next door . Also I need to add the bench along the half of restaurant sits you up above the table oddly and only one 2 top is without bench at this time .  We stopped in for lunch and our server was very warm and informative .  For lunch we started with very fresh salads made of spinach , just the right amount of feta cheese , plump fresh blackberries , candied nuts with raspberry dressing .  We tried the panini with blackberries , goat cheese , fig on home made bread (like focaccia) . The panini had a nice light crunch and you get a taste that is was salted , the cheese wasn't too tangy it was creamy so it was a better goat cheese this sandwich sounds sweet but it wasn't so it was good .  We also had the special gnocchi with pancetta in a smoked cheddar cream sauce , this was a perfect lunch portion and it was seasoned nicely . for two drinks ,two lunch salads , two meals the bill with tax before tip was approx $21.  we liked it we'd go back but I will pick the chair again

THE WEEKDAY $15. THREE COURSE LUNCH SPECIAL (w/beverage) IS PHENOMENAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is a small restaurant with a small patio that's covered with leaves from an old tree. There isn't a parking lot here so you have to park on the street.   All the food we had was very detailed and delicious with some surprising ingredients. The food was presented like an artist painted it.   They started us out with a complimentary appetizer of crispy leeks with cranberries. The Leeks were tastier than potato chips and the cranberries seemed marinated. They were a fun snack.  For my first course I picked the Paprika Parmesan Hummus. It was very unusual but also very good. It came with fresh grilled and seasoned pita bread and many perfectly placed vegetables including Shiitake Mushroom Caps. For me the favors of the hummus popped the most on the slightly softened carrots.  It was hard to decide on the main course because two of the three were calling me but I went with the Ahi Tuna Salad. It came out in a heavy kettle but revealed a very delicate salad inside. The salad had capers that were crisped and opened up into flowers. The Tuna was very fresh. Tiny pieces of goat cheese pulled it together and the Orange Segments were very refreshing. This was a very above average salad and a lovely fresh picked pansy just topped it off.  My husband had the other dish that seemed very interesting to me. It was Marsala Braised Beef with Pumpkin, White Truffle Smoked Egg, and Crispy Leeks. It also was interesting as it was delicious.  We both picked the cheese plate for our dessert course. We received a chunk of good quality cheese with mustard and raspberry sauce, house made bread, crushed pepper and smoked salt.  The portions were just right. Not too much and not too little.  The beverage was included beer and wine were an option.  The $15. Lunch Special made the meal seem like a special occasion.  It just doesn't get any better than this!

You can't see this place from the road since it's hidden in a business mall across from the Deer Valley Airport. This is a very casual order at the counter kind of place and your food quickly gets ran to you.  I tried the smoked chicken and was expecting it to be pulled BBQ Chicken but instead it was two chicken thighs. The chicken was very moist and tender with a careful gentle light smoke flavor. I thought it was very good and didn't really need any sauce but I had to try one of the assorted sauces on the table for fun. This plate comes with two sides I tried the cole slaw and it seemed very fresh, was sort of sweet but it was drip free so I thought that was good. I also tried the macaroni and cheese, it was seasoned nicely and was familiar like what you eat at a picnic.  My husband tried the Monster that was described to us as brisket and pulled pork with two sides. It however is a sandwich of the two meats together topped with coleslaw. Like the smoked chicken I had the meat in this sandwich isn't all sauced up but you can use the assorted sauces on the table if you care too. My husband did like the sandwich and said it was very good but would order something different next time because he's been here before and liked the regular plates better. He said the beans here are very porky.   The staff thanked us for coming as we were leaving.

This is a family friendly Italian-American Restaurant that mostly serves pizzas, sandwiches and pasta in a traditional Italian looking setting. They start you off with complimentary baked dough cut in bite size pieces and herbed mild tasting oil.  I decided to try the Thai House Calzone. When I was presented with the calzone I thought it looked beautiful. It had a very perfect looking shape and a nice golden brown color. It also was very large and I know it can feed two people. I liked that it was filled with lots of fresh spinach and vegetables. The flavors were ok...But I had two problems with the calzone. One was the chicken in it. The chicken was some sort of over marinated chicken that had a texture like biting threw rubber. As I was eating the calzone I thought it had melty white cheese in it but I was wrong. It was raw dough. I didn't feel I could send it back because I would just get another one that was the same. I also didn't feel like complaining about it because they only had one waitress on that was waiting on all the tables.   My husband had a sausage sandwich. The sausage used is heavy with sage and the sandwich was more like a pizza just made on sandwich bread with the same thin slices of sausage.The sausage sandwich was really ok and if this review was based on the sausage sandwich I would have given three stars.  Service was pleasant. 2.5 stars

We thought the food was good, we both tried the Specialty of the house the 6in. Italian Beef sandwich wet style as suggested. They were much bigger than expected and filled much more than expected and the hot pepper mix was tasty this sandwich can feed two people. This sandwich is very sloppy to eat and that's OK but you will have to use the restroom to clean yourself up after you eat it.  This one star rating is because we WILL NEVER COME BACK after visiting the restrooms.  The women's restroom has deep embedded dirt in the floor with heaping piles of dust that you can see around the edges. I have NEVER SEEN such a dirty floor.  The men's restroom was out of soap.  This is NOT ACCEPTABLE

The management thanked me profusely for my input on Yelp and graciously invited me to return as a guest to show me the true Latilla Experience. I was told changes have been made because of reading my YELP review.The changes are that dinner portions are more ample than before, the appetizer plate share charge is gone now and I noticed the web site has been updated. This visit showed little resemblance to the service I had last time. A full staff was on with staff working in sync as a team with all the tables not just mine.  I was even more blown away with the food than the last time due to perhaps I picked foods that were more suiting to me some highs were-  Beet salad- it was similar to others I had in other places but this one also had HOUSE GROWN BEETS ,Riesling soaked pears and the toasted hazelnuts made the salad  pop with flavor.   Foraged mushroom rissotto-correctally made with a depth of flavor, it was good on it's own but this had an added embellishment of a SIXTY TWO DEGREE duck egg.   Nicely seasoned and prepared fresh branzino sat on top of ribbon cut caponata, an unusual surprise was the vinaigrette and the ribbon cut string less celery that was very good.   We also enjoyed the Kobe Flap steak with wine reduction and tiny marble size multi color potatoes and tasty spinach.  Since we skipped the interesting desserts last time we had to try one this time and tried the chocolate hazelnut cake with jam-figs and mascarpone gelato this dessert was garnished with a chocolate sort of lavender crisp and roasted hazelnuts. This dessert was something Iron chef worthy for sure with all the flavors working well together.  The service we had was phenomenal.  The food at Latilla is masterfully done, the surroundings are majestic and breathtaking. The meal we had wasn't ordinary it was extraordinary!

Sophisticated refined Asian Tea house that is in a turn of the century bungalow serving Very reasonably priced well crafted foods.  We decided to try for lunch and were told the plates were small so we ordered three  plates to share but really two plates would be enough.  We started with the grilled tofu salad,with udon noodles, cucumber, and greens. The tofu was marinated and very lightly grilled and it, along with the noodles picked up most of the flavor of the dressing. ($8)  The short rib steamed buns were like sandwiches not stuffed like buns and had precision cut Tokyo Negi (onion) inside them with house made pickles (celery) the meat in the bun had a most perfect tasty char but was also marinated and for some people the taste of the marinate is an acquired taste,don't misunderstand it was good but fish essence was part of the flavor. The steamed fresh bun was the best I ever had and we were served two sandwiches so again this was a generous portion. ($8)  The most impressive bursting with pleasing flavors plate we had was the panko fried soft shell crab on house made foccia served with side of fennel cole slaw. Perfect in preparation,great pops of taste with kanzuri aiol (Asian red pepper paste) I think purple shiso herb (minty fennel like basil) and cucumber sandwich. My only thought is this was perfect and didn't need the dressing on both sides of sandwich. The house made focaccia bun was so light and fresh and the herb that was used under the top bun that I think was shiso transformed and elevated the taste tremendously. The fennel cole slaw was the best I ever had and was like fireworks in your mouth it was delicious. ($10)  some plates are a whisper and some plates are a scream, service was exceptionally good. The menu is limited so you need to examine before you dine.

The food without a doubt is ADVENTUROUS, INTERESTING and UNIQUE. Most of the experience was downright MAGICAL. We tried a flight of meticulous made assorted sweet potato spirits all with different aromas and changing flavors. The plates here are very small so you need to order between four to six plates for a couple for dinner. The stand out dishes that we tried were some sort of Carpacci made with fluke and served with foccacia, it was presented and sizzled when the server poured a liquid over it. The KNOCK OUT DISH was the Fried Black Back Sole with blood orange vinaigrette and BONE CHIPS. YES I SAID BONE CHIPS. The flavors and textures were over the top for sure this is a must try dish. The fried bones taste sort of like potato chips but tastier than potato chips.  Other dished we tried were all good but didn't stand out like the ones I mentioned above.   We tried  dessert  sampler plate. I must be blunt and will just say I most likely WON'T try dessert here again.  Nobuo participates on localdines.com so you might want to check that out.  This is a very difficult to rate because some plates are so masterful and so creative I feel it's a crime not to give five stars but on the other hand I don't feel all plates are a true five stars. If I figure price point per skill of some of the dishes I lean towards five stars.  4.5 stars

Nobuo At Teeter House is one of the places I can go to to experience wonderful exciting magical foods that are unlike any foods I'd ever prepare at home.   The shochu (Japanese Vodka like liquor) flights are interesting and fun to try because they are made in a careful meticulous way and not just poured in your glass. The shochu flights have different aromas and changing flavors and you need to just sip them very slowly threw your dining.  Everything we had was more wonderful than I can describe but everything is also very small plates that are meant to be shared. You might need to order between two though four plates a person depending on what you pick.  Both the dishes on the cold plate menu we tried really were like fireworks in your mouth. They were so layered with many very good flavors. This time we tried the Grapefruit and Hamachi that tasted magical and the Carpaccio that tasted and looked magical. The carpaccio comes out with someone pouring a boiling steaming oil on it and they bring you out the smallest amount of the tastiest focaccia bread to soak up the insanely delicious remaining goodness on the plate. They were so good it will be a hard decision to try something different next time.  One of the more adventurous dishes is the Fried Black Cod orange vinaigrette and BONE CHIPS. This meal has lots of flavor and the bone chips are far more tasty than any potato chip that you ever put in your mouth. My only criticism is that this was an even smaller fish than I had last time with only one piece of bone chips instead of the three pieces I had last time.  Service was gracious and outstanding.  I enjoyed my meal here very much but I don't think Nobuo at Teeter House is for everyone because the plates are very small and most of the plates are mostly protein with a small amount of vegetables. Rice is not served with the meals because it is not traditional in Japan when you drink Japanese spirits since they might be made of rice.  Nobuo at Teeter House participates on local dines dot com and you can save a good amount of money if you take advantage of that.

I am very embarrassed I ate here. So much so I didn't even photograph because anyone would think this was just a hate review. I will start with my iced Tea.  I went to the iced tea dispenser and got splashed in the belly with cold iced tea. The manager just laughed when she saw saw iced tea hit me in the stomach  but she did wipe it off the floor.... (yeah)  I thought the packaged salsa looked better than the salsa bar salsa because the salsa bar salsa looked like it was just frozen tomatoes just brought out.  The  chicken in my salad was so dry I don't think anybody body would come back for trying chicken here. (In the salad anyway)  And the tomatoes seemed like thawed  grainy frozen tomatoes and the dressing was just Mayo with a little green stuff in it.  It was very bad food....sorry

I came here to try the delicatessen food and that is what my rating is on. On a positive note this place is in a nice location with a pleasant dog friendly patio. The inside is nice and bright. You don't have table service as you order at the counter, seat yourself, and they run the food to you.  I soon received my lox platter. The cucumbers, onions and tomatoes were nice and fresh cut. I took half the bagel and spread the cream cheese on it and noticed that the cream cheese was very thin and seemed like it was whipped and then thinned  down. I tasted it and it lacked the tang that cream cheese needs. NOBODY ANYWHERE thins down cream cheese and it was terrible. The bagel was fresh but very odd to me because of it's texture. It lacked the chewiness and yeast-ty-ness that a bagel normally has. But the MOST DISAPPOINTING thing about this platter was the lox. I wasn't sure at first if it was the lack of quality or the lack of freshness about the taste. It actually was fishy tasting with lots of salt. After maybe three bites I think it was both issues and didn't eat the rest. This was the worst lox and cream cheese I ever tried anywhere.  We also tried a potato knish. The first thing I noticed was the knish was very untraditional in appearance and was wrapped in puff pastry instead of the normal knish dough. The filling had the texture of instant potatoes and lacked the onion flavor and taste the filling normally has. The puff pastry was gooey in areas see photo.  We also had DRY but fatty pastrami on fluffy mild thick rye bread. The pastrami would have been good if it was prepared properly as it seemed mishandled like someone just fried it instead of braising it for maybe two more hours with some onions to make it tender and juicy. The fluffy that lacked sour rye bread just was a sponge for the oily fatty dry pastrami.  Lastly it was obvious that the potato salad was home made because the flavoring was    a combination of unbalanced spices and too much mustard. Only someone without taste buds would be able to choke the stuff down.  I was WRONG not to complain about the lox but my head was just spinning about everything.  Old tasting lox weird texture bagel WATERED Down cream cheese not good gooey knish almost hard dry pastrami inedible potato salad  Nobody asked us how things were and I didn't feel like walking back in with my dogs and telling them.   I would be understanding if a relative or neighbor prepared food like this but I expect at least passable quality at a restaurant. I do feel terrible about giving a small business only one star but the truth is wild horses can't drag me back to eat here again.  Oy Vay!  Usually deli food is very filling but here you can leave hungry.

DAM, we can't wait to eat at the Beaver again! it's true! it's true!  But before I tell you how great it was a few things need to be mentioned. I was teetering between 4-5 stars on this one because of the European Style Service and I had to forgive them for using canned green beans in the green bean salad. However because of the really over the top seasoning of the prepared foods we tried and the UNIQUENESS of this Quirky one of a Kind place it deserves five stars. You also need to know that this is a Tiny Mom and Pop shop in a strip mall that is BYOB SCANDINAVIAN Bistro that makes your meals fresh to order and when we were the only order it took at least half and hour to prepare. This is not a fancy place and they provide some games like Yahtzee to play with while you wait.  We ordered the Chicken Schnitzel and the Gravlax platter,the platters come with THREE SIDE SALADS EACH and A SIDE DISH!  I had the Gravlax and it was sliced very thin was very fresh and very flavorful I think anyone who eats Lox would like the Gravlox here. For my side salads I picked the house made cole slaw,it was very light and fresh no creamy heavy sauce(it was very good) , tomato basil salad, it was very fresh with lots of fresh basil and yummy balsamic , Peas (just plain) and for my side dish I picked the rosti potato. THAT POTATO was DELICIOUS but was SO LARGE it could feed a small country I could only eat about 1/4 of it.  My husband had the regular chicken schnitzel it was pounded thin , breaded just right and came with a side of mushroom sauce,It tasted very good. One of the sides he picked was the green bean salad and I noticed they are canned green beans, that really is my only slight complaint on any food here.  They don't sell any desserts that are day old here only fresh made and they have the good humor to sell a dessert called Beaver Balls.

THE SECRET $25 ANTIPASTO   is as as good as it gets in Las Vegas .  You can only get it if you ask for it and sit at the antipasto bar and is only available 3pm-7pm and after dinner time 10pm on till? . YOU GET ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED TWO PEOPLE!  Holy Giovanni! you get close to 12 different samplings , mostly vegetable salads and cheeses and then some house made meats next following some of the tastiest fried Italian samplers you can imagine even biscotti samples.  We got for only $25  Rosemary Focaccia three cheeses with three toppings assorted house cured meats arancine (fried rice balls with cheese) fried prosciutto balls fried cauliflower grilled radicchio with smoked mozzarella summer vegetables and farro roasted beets with saba eggplant caponata biscotti (last time 2 this time 4 all different)  We've had this special two years in a row , this time it had less in the salad courses  (smaller plates but more in the fried. )STILL for only $25. this can't be missed and you have to ask for it since it isn't posted . It's a reason to dine in Las Vegas. I think only offered near the Antipasto Bar if you ask.  This is the best gift Las Vegas can give us you feel like a WINNER! This is a Mario Batali Restaurant in the Venetian .

the produce section gave my stomach a Charley Horse .   I almost passed out walking by the big stack of bagged potatoes that were giving off a strong stink that was worst than 100 cat liter boxes .   I also saw peppers that were shrived rotten and with unknown white stuff coming out of them .   Once in a while you can find a true bargain that you may or may not need like a #10 can of cocktail sauce that is still in date or warm designer dog coats for our chilly summers .   good LUCK! and happy hunting .

The staff was very welcoming to us and our waiter was extremely pleasant informative and knowledgeable. It was hard to decide on starters because so many things sounded so comforting like grilled cheese sandwiches macaroni and cheese and deep fried deviled eggs. But we decided to start with the house made Burrata cheese plate. It came with two kinds of tasty bread, seasoned cashews and a house made cranberry sauce that made it special. Our waiter highly recommended the brussels Sprouts. I thought they were good but not something I would order again.  Both Fish Dinners they were offering came with pureed vegetables. I usually don't care for any vegetable pureed because the vegetable turns into baby food texture and usually is loaded up with lots of butter and cream and usually no longer taste like what it was. Or sometimes it is just a smear on your plate and reminds me of a dog scoot on a carpet.  But I wanted to order a fish dinner anyway because I look forward to fish dinners out because I can't buy fresh fish from any markets by me to make at home.  I was brave and decided to try the White Bass. The fish was fresh and steamed well but really had very little flavor on it's own but when you dipped the fish on the very flavorful carrot puree it had something going on there. Who knew the puree would work here. The puree wasn't too buttery or packed with too much cream it was actually intense with flavor and I'll give it a thumbs up. The vegetables were an unusual combination of fennel a slight amount of corn and poblano peppers. The poblanos were done in a way that gave crunch and texture to the dish.  My husband had the Osso Buco and it was terrific according to him. He also enjoyed the apple and onion spaetzle that came with it.  Prices seemed very reasonable, it was a good time out!

Unique, interesting and different Thai but I do note very small portions.  We started with stuffed mustard leaves called Miang Kum. I don't know what all was in them but they were a roller coaster of sweet spicy sour crunchy and coconut. They don't taste like those Girl Scout Samoa Cookies but had that same additive quality and that same coconut snap to them.  I tried the Stuffed Eggplant with Chicken in Green Curry Sauce called Kang Makeur Sai. I do have to say the Green Curry sauce was nearly perfect and was the best Green Curry sauce I've tried in years because it wasn't too sweet and also didn't have too much coconut milk. I liked the taste of the dish but for me it was too soft of a dish in texture for me. It was sort of like an Asian Pancake with a small amount of chicken wrapped with soft eggplant in a really delicious well made sauce.   My husband tried the Spicy Stir Fried Pork Shoulder with asparagus called Kua Kling Mu. He liked the taste of it but was disappointed with the portion and said out loud, "I will need to stop for a hamburger because there is only two ounces of meat on this plate".  I would like to return and try other interesting things here but I know my husband will never suggest this place so I don't know if I will ever return.  I noticed that they offer $7.00 lunch specials and a three course dinner special (I think $36.00)

Chances are you will have a nice meal here but I feel the meal I had was one star worthy. I am giving two stars because my husbands meal was fine and the dining room manager tried to fix.  We decided to try for Saturday Lunch and I thought the chicken wrap plate might be nice since the menu described it with jicama and pecans with chipotle mayo. The meals came out and my plate looked pretty but I sort of knew I wouldn't like it when I saw the wraps were filled with lots of Mayo ( seriously one third , the wraps were standing up on the plate like towers ) and to make it worse they were standing on a large amount of chipotle mayo ( you were expected to dip your mayo wrap into mayo) . This plate came with a nice side of salad so I knew I could eat that. I choose to eat it because I knew my husband was starving and wouldn't eat unless I did. I ate the side salad and it was good I took a bite into the wrap and the contents spilled out onto the chipotle mayo pool that was on my plate. I didn't notice any jicama and only saw a few crumbs of pecans in it but it did have a few chunks of cucumber in it . I ate half the wrap and was finished AND NOW MY WAITER CHECKS ON US. I told him about the mayo problem and he offered to get me something else and I say I ate already and don't want more food. Then the dining room manager comes over and offers to get me something else and I say that's not necessary since I ate already. The dining room manager sees my leftover half wrap and suggest that I can enjoy the other half of my wrap latter if I just add extra chicken to it and offers to box it for me with some extra chicken. We received the extra chicken and it was hot chicken.  I just have to say this was an awful recipe for chicken salad or perhaps the recipe wasn't followed?

More often than NOT I agree with the Yelp Rating but Not for Holstiens. I do note what I tried might have differed from what others had. I am Not saying Holsteins is a bad burger as it was OK and Good but for a high priced burger I was expecting the beef  patty a full fat one to taste better with more flavor and juice than when I cook a 93% lean burger at home.  I got the Fungi Burger. I was expecting more mushrooms than onions but it was mostly onions that were very good I add. I upgraded the aged sirloin beef to wagu style since I buy this meat once in a while and it's very good. My burger was juicy enough but did lack flavor. I was expecting it to taste really good and beefy. I liked the study well sized bun but my sweet potato fried seemed old.  My husband had a dry aged sirloin burger with bacon , goat cheddar cheese and arugula. He had to send back his bun because it was hard as a rock. We laughed about it with the waiter and got a new one fast. His medium rare burger was lacking in taste and was oddly juiceless. He complained to me and said it's not as tasty or juicy as your 93% lean burgers you make at home.  That's how it was  expensive and we had better.  But I note service was excellent.

This turned out to be one of the ONLY places OPEN for breakfast when we were here at the airport as we did search for a better option but turned out almost nothing .  We we stood to order and a worker stayed there scrubbing the fryer and we waited and waited then a cook came out sipping coffee and said "someone will be with us shortly" after a few minutes more people were pile-ling up in line and the person scrubbing the fryer decided on taking orders . We ordered the breakfast egg muffin sandwiches with the hash-browns and they were tossed to us from a drawer below the counter almost warm in foil and we were told they would make some hash-browns soon . I did see hot dogs spinning be thought they might be from last night but as it turned out I fear the breakfast sandwich might have been older .   I took a bite and even after adding ketchup salt and pepper THIS WAS NOT EDIBLE . The muffin was uncooked without nooks or crannies and sort of had a solid cardboard taste (YUK!) I don't have a clue on how to make an inedible egg the way they did it because it was far worst than any frozen or microwaved egg , not only was it UNFIT for HUMAN consumption I also would NEVER feed my DOG something this NASTY . The egg (?egg) was thick and solid and might have been mixed with something unknown or was maybe just so old I just don't know , or a combination of both , I couldn't sample more to figure it out . THE CHEESE (NOT CHEESE) was thick ORANGE something between WAX , PASTE , RUBBER and Slime so these sandwiches WENT IN THE TRASH FAST!  The hash-browns were edible they turned out to be chopped up french fries ate a few forks full .  I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE RITZ -BUT THIS WAS THE PITS As far as I am concerned they stole $15 from us .

The Wicked Spoon Buffet is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel/Casino on the Strip. I thought a few things on the buffet were very good like the smoked salmon, the beet, fancy cheese and hazelnut vinaigrette salad and the mini lime cream puff. The angry mac-n-cheese was ok but not spicy and had a skin on it from sitting out.   Short Story- Much of the food really was dried out or just not seasoned right. Desserts looked amazing but most didn't taste as good as they looked.   Longer story- I took tandoori chicken that was absolutely flavorless. Some sort of Asian Chicken that was chewy like rubber over hard dried out rice. The pizza looked like cafeteria pizza and not like real pizza that you want to eat. The kung pao chicken had POW but no kung. (spicy but no flavor & chewy chicken) My husband took an individual lasagna that was a little pot of mostly just sauce. The desserts all look amazing but when the chocolate covering on the strawberry was like a brown waxy thick rock. Same with the pretty cone shape dessert. The mini tarts and cheese cake are edible but not so good and not worth the calories. Only the mini lime cream puff was delicious. They do offer many frozen deserts that I didn't try.  The service was friendly and plates were cleared quickly.  I was here for lunch.

THE THREE COURSE $22.13 LUNCH IS PHENOMENAL!  The start everyone off with crusty bread and high quality Greek Olive Oil.  It's difficult to decide on your appetizer because they all sound so good. I tried the bagel and cream cheese with Nova Scotia Salmon. The salmon was rich and fresh and the toasted bagel was a lighter kind that seemed more like toast. My husband had the ($10.00) supplemental Maryland Crab Cake. It was the real thing just like what you really get in Baltimore.   The menu is mostly fish and some do have supplemental pricing.  I picked the Greek Sea bass that they call Lavraki because they told me it was FRESH FLOWN IN EVERY DAY. They gave me a whole fish that was mostly free of bones very simply dressed and prepared to perfection garnish with a little fresh broccoli. The Honjake Salmon was prepared just the same and was also pristine fresh and melted like butter in your mouth.  I welcomed the beautiful fresh fruit plate. I thought that was a very nice ending.  If you eat fish this place should be on your must go places  for lunch in Las Vegas.

From the outside this place looks nothing special sort of like any fast food joint but when you walk in you see the tables are not lament but granite and the chairs are artwork not banquet and that is a clue that this place is not average .  This place IS SPECIAL sort of Rocket burger special and La Comida special so if you are a fan of these kind of family owned places you will love this spot and I feel like a dirt bag for not giving 5 stars since it is so Authentic  and can not be improved ,also the family working here are so nice but I HAVE TO KEEP IT REAL as possible . This is VERY CASUAL eat in styro-foam dining . For ME this is really three star food but it was so over the top of the kind it is a have to add a star and can TOTALLY understand why most people rate this at 5 stars because it really is 5 stars special .  We were BLOWN AWAY with our first order here and shared the Chicken and beef BBQ combo and the Lemon pepper chicken . This food was ROCKIN GOOD and so FRESH also the BBQ here in my mind can blow the nearby FAMOUS you know Who Chain away . I also need to mention the portions are extra big so you know .  They have many other interesting things to try I have to try the Island Chicken Curry ,  steamed vegetables , Chicken Katsu salad , and some Musubi and I need to try in future visits at some point for me .  This IS A TRUE GEM of PEORIA and across from Arrowhead mall Area it is a crime if you pass this one by .

This place REALLY is a GEM for FAST CASUAL dining, my last meal I tried is my current favorite.   Musubi with Steamed Vegetables, the Musubi is like a GIANT sort of sushi a sticky rice roll that has a center of breaded fish or chicken with a pleasant slightly sweet sauce and it is wrapped in Norri. Musubi is on the appetizer platter for only $3.59 and you get TWO,they are LARGE and measure two inch wide by 4 inch long and I had the fish ones and they were very tasty and you can only eat one at a meal,if you are a normal eater.  I also had steamed vegetables, they were so fresh and tasty for simple steamed vegetables and I ate all I could of the carrots, broccoli, cabbage, and snow peas and they were guilt free and healthy.  I spent VERY little and enjoyed my meal very much and had half to enjoy again  latter for another nearly guilt free mostly healthy meal. (see my photo)  I have been here a few times and tried several different dishes so I think they really do offer something for many people with different taste and this place really is a BEST for fast casual dining near the Arrowhead Mall area. Also the Maui Burger is so awesome good,Yummy yummy! delish!  They are FAMILY OWNED and Operated and are very accommodating to you.

If you have ever been to Hawaii and a local takes you out to eat Leo's is just what you'd get down to the styrofoam container. The portions run extra large . The prices are low and the food is always hot and fresh.  On my most recent visit I had the Curry BBQ Chicken . (I think it was $6.99 and 50.cents extra for brown rice) The sauce was tasty and not too thick , creamy or heavy. The dark meat chicken was prepared nice and was a very generous portion. The macaroni salad is the kind that a dap of sriracha transforms it into something very tasty. I liked that they put a bed of steamed vegetables that is mostly cabbage under your entree and they offer brown rice as an option. It is a ton of food and you can't eat it all. But the thing is it's good and better than just about anything from the mall food court.  I've tried many other things over the years and I really like the Island Grilled Fish they make it very tasty. The BBQ is all good even the beef. They make a variety of noodle soups that are good. The lemon pepper chicken is a little lighter and made with white meat.   One of the very few non chain places by the mall as they are family owned and operated.  A GEM of a place for Fast Casual Dining in this area!

Very Good Fast/casual Hawaiian Food just like what I had in Hawaii!  I am a regular because the food is always good and is always served piping hot and very fresh 100% of the time. Leo's Island BBQ one of the few family owned business in the Arrowhead Mall area.   One of my favorite Meals from Leo's Island BBQ is the Island Curry Chicken with potatoes, onions and Carrots in a Yellow Curry Sauce. This one is made with a very generous amount of white meat natural chicken that's always so moist and fresh, it's a pleasure to eat. I enjoy their House Made Curry Sauce it's made with exotic seasoning that's so tasty I crave it. They serve most of the plate meals over fresh steamed cabbage with a couple pieces of fresh steamed broccoli. You get a double scoop of steamed Rice (white or Brown(extra for brown) and a scoop of very fresh macaroni salad that I love with a squirt of Sriracha. Because the portion is so big I get two meals out of this and that's a Win!  Often I also get the Mahi Mahi Grilled Fish. It's always very fresh tasting and I like the crispy edges they get on the fish. Sometimes I get the Lemon Pepper Chicken or a noodle soup when I'm in the mood for something a little lighter.   My husband enjoys everything he tried here. He usually get a combo plate of BBQ Chicken and Kalua Pork and enjoys it every time. He enjoys other foods from here too like when he last got the shrimp he was very impressed that they cooked it perfect. He also likes the Moco Loco.  The food from Leo's Island BBQ is very solid and prices are low. You might just do a Hula!  4.5 Stars

I used to think they were OK for what they are. This is family owned American Style Mexican Restaurant that always has fresh made salsa that always taste good and dirt cheap $3.00 margaritas that gets you whoosey.  I was here this weekend and had the Chicken Fajita Salad (the only thing I eat from here) because it is decent. I pulled out a long piece of bacon from it. I didn't make a big deal about it because I thought maybe bacon was their secret seasoning. It sort of bothered me since I never noticed bacon before and I called them up today and the girl on phone said they don't have bacon in the restaurant so it must have fallen out of someones sandwich or something.  This place is a slop house. They don't care about what they slop on a plate. That Violates menu accuracy.

I keep going back and forth between three and two stars on this one. Like I said before Popo's isn't the best or most authentic Mexican Cuisine but you can usually count on delicious salsa,  warm corn chips and the strongest cheapest margaritas in town. This is a budget Sonoran Style Restaurant that gets very busy very early. You can get there at 5:00 and the place might be packed and on a half hour wait.  I usually get the Chicken Fajita salad because it's usually tasty. It differs slightly every time I order it but it's usually OK. One time a big piece of bacon was dropped into it and I let them know about it. They said they don't have any bacon in the restaurant so it must have fallen out of someone's sandwich. That time I lowered them to two stars because that is what I consider to be a slop house.  I decided to try a chile relleno. Usually chile rellenos are very tasty. Not always but they usually are a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with cheese then batter dipped and fried and served with sauce. I think I tasted what seemed like a canned chile stuffed with cheese, topped with cooked egg whites and covered with a green chile sauce that tasted liked the canned green chile and then topped with a thick blanket of cheese. I ate as much of it as I could but my stomach locked up. It might have been the worst thing I ever tried to eat. I do note that I don't know if the green chile was canned or fresh but it tasted canned to me. This was very unappetizing to me.  I also ordered a side of vegetables to go with the chile relleno. I thought the vegetables looked and tasted great. But they were piled on top of a dried out old piece of steak. I thought that was terrible again they are a slop house AGAIN to me.  The last two times I was here I did notice that they changed the guacamole recipe and it's not as good as it used to be. It now seemed like it's made with frozen avocados. The taste and texture is different.  I used to think the super strong margaritas were fun but now they just make me sick they are so strong.  With all that said Popo's does have some redeeming qualities. They make very good carnitas. The chicken fajita salad is usually tasty. Delicious salsa. Service is usually good.

The Good  The Hostess and Waitress seemed nice and the place is cute modern neat and clean .  The Bad  Bread basket contained squishy bread (Italians don't eat this kind of bread) but they do get a point for adding an herb and salting the top .   pizzetta (margarita) I don't know how to describe but the crust had that very similar taste to frozen pizzas not even like a bad pizza out and unripe roma tomatoes were placed on top , the addition of some fresh basil topped the pie but didn't save it from tasting sort of cardboard like this was not tasty and after a bite or two we didn't feel like eating more .  Herb roasted salmon tasted farm raised and was cooked to approx well done not sure about herbs but it tasted like salt pepper and garlic just a notch better than salmon off an Asian Buffet . This salmon ($15.75) dinner only came with what I think was the frozen broccoli cauliflower carrot mix you can always taste frozen especially in the broccoli . If I had this same meal in a food court at the mall  I'd say it was OK for a food court meal but even fresh vegetables are served at Panda Express and I don't intentionally go out to eat and pay for meals that are far lower quality than what I'd eat at home .  My husband had the penne pepperonata and he thought his peppers were raw and said the sauce tasted like crushed tomatoes out of a can without seasoning also the pasta was gooey and over done .   I do feel sick and sad for who ever owns this place and I hope they aren't like this all the time . I hope they get help from someone on how to prepare better food . Last Night was our first visit here but even Wild Horses would not be able to drag us back for a second visit .  as a slight update the owner contacted me and said I was a "mudslinger" and he said I HAD A GOAL in saying something awful about his place...Gosh I don't know what I set wrong in my Yelp for not getting his message posted.  I am NOT endorsing not to visit his place.....  he didn't say anything about what I said about the food.  maybe I was there when they weren't at their best? maybe we've ordered what they do least well? and maybe? they've improved since...I hope so give them a try......  I don't know what to say to the owner other than that. also I will mention now...that I left out we took our unfinished pizza home and it was packed sent to us all stuck together so I had to throw it out...I wanted to retry in case I was too harsh but as I said before they had unripe tomatoes that day so it didn't taste good and the dough I think might be frozen or a mix?

We ordered BBQ Brisket sliders and a Hamburger .  We waited and waited and waited I don't know how much time passed but the waiter apologized to us and said our food would come right up . (Lunch time) Then we continued to wait and I think  at this point another 20 minutes passed and we were told we didn't have to pay for our meals. I hate to be ungrateful but I need to mention my medium burger came out dry and well done and I had some decent fries but they were thrown over fries underneath that were also raw and not cooked . I was told they rolled out a new menu yesterday and the kitchen just stayed in a meltdown mode . I also know I should have ordered something BBQ since it is a BBQ place but they didn't have a BBQ Brisket sandwich on the menu and only had it in sliders I find sliders are too much bread for me and I am not liking sliders these days .  My husband ordered the BBQ Brisket sliders and I took a bite and I do have to say they are absolutely delicious , not too fatty and flavored just right , with pickled onions that really make them bright and pop ! The meat to bun ratio was much better than other sliders I've tried .  I would give them another try and order something beef brisket but I would never order a burger from here.

It might be premature after only one visit to give this place five stars but if it's not it's awful darn close to five stars as I couldn't find one darn thing wrong with our dinner or service we had here. The room is a bit on the dark side but it's crisp linen and shiny silverware. The menu goes from very casual with bar food to sandwiches to maybe about a half dozen dinners.  Upton entering we were greeted warmly and whisked to a table. Our server was very professional, explained the specials and was friendly. The cocktails we tried were good and also packed punch.  We started with a special appetizer of an all house made plate of Tasso that came with  mustard and pickles. Everything was excellent even the pickled okra and pickled watermelon rind.  My plate of Pacific Rock-fish with curry millet and stewed okra and tomatoes was delicious as well. The fish was fresh, seasoned and prepared well. The curry millet was a curry for curry lovers meaning full strength flavor and was an interesting healthy alternative grain to use. Bird seed just never tasted that good before. I sort of feared stewed okra because I have had it before and didn't enjoy it's texture but in this dish it was enjoyable and anybody would like it because it had a fresh crispness to it and picked up the delicious sweet flavor of the small tomatoes.  I was too busy with my plate to try my husband's Amaro Meatloaf but he said it was very good and also enjoyed the potatoes. he said, "they taste just like your potatoes" I take that as a compliment.  The waiter described a very refined adult style nut butter and boozy fruit sandwich as dessert that I wanted to try but unfortunately I was too busy with my plate to have room for it.   Very very good  don't know if everything on menu is as good as what we tried but what we tried was excellent.

Tasty TINY tacos that are inexpensive in a VERY NO FRILLS repeat very no frills   atmosphere. You order at the counter and they run the food to you. Between us we tried four different ones that were all seasoned differently. They were all tasty and good. The fish ones came on a very thin fresh tasting flour tortilla and the others came on double stacked corn tortillas .I heard they are Oaxaca Style. I tried to find out what Oaxaca is but the only information I found was that Grasshopper Tacos are popular in Oaxaca and mole sauces are popular there. I've had real street tacos on the streets in Mexico but they were Jalisco and did differ in taste so I can't compare them . They gave us small sides of thin avocado based sauce , green salsa , grilled onions and an inedible super hot roasted chili pepper that looked like a Serrano to me but might have been a jalapeño. Unfortunately my husband took a bite out of the pepper and started hiccuping. I just tasted without eating the tiniest piece and my lips swelled up like balloons because it really was that hot . The pinto beans were very runny like soup but tasty and had an unexpected cheese surprise at the bottom of the dish.  A bottled water five tacos and a side of beans was less than $12. before tip.  3.75 stars

We came in extra early for dinner on the way to an event. The place was packed and on a wait with mostly sports enthusiast also on the way to an event. That normally is a good sign that things should be running well. I did notice the hostess using great restraint not filling every single table to pace the kitchen. Eventually we got seated, my husband ordered a drink off the drink menu, I thought they might run too sweet so I ordered what I thought was a common drink that you can get anywhere a bloody mary. The waiter comes back very apologetic and tells me they don't have the ingredients to make a bloody mary and hands me the drink menu so real fast I picked skinny mojito not realizing it was raspberry flavored because I picked it out too fast and didn't read it all. He brings it over and the color is bubblegum pink. So I tried it and there was no way anyone anywhere can drink this drink, it really was that bad the chemical taste was overwhelming. IT WAS THE WORST DRINK I EVER TASTED ANYWHERE and I wasn't even able to chug it for a buzz. I do note my husbands drink was drinkable but left an after taste in my mouth and he also couldn't believe how horrible the raspberry mojito was.  We decided to share and start with two cheeses that come with two chunks of bread each and a tiny pot of rasp berried cherries. This was the highlight of the meal and I am not a fan of rasp berried cherries. However the cheeses and bread was fresh cut to order and that is how it should be done.  When we finished my waiter did notice I pushed away the drink and asked me if I wanted to try another drink. I said no, I will just drink water and he took it away. (and off the bill)  I decided to try the salmon and envisioned it tasting good with apples and farro. But what I received was less than a dieters portion as a whole, the fish had a nice sear on it but wasn't as fresh as I like and was a little over cooked but edible. A very small amount of spinach and fennel garnished the fish that was approximately a tablespoon total. I could tell just by looking at the farro it wasn't cooked. I was brave and decided to try the farro and it was undercooked being very chewy and also was what I am thinking might have been end of the pan because it also was HARD AND CRUNCHY and I could have damaged my teeth eating it. I also wasn't a fan of the flavors because this entree was as sweet as dessert. Little tiny light like small water chestnut shape things were elevating the salmon and they was odd, honestly I thought they were water chestnuts but they turned out to be the apples that I forgot about. I doubt that this dish is suppose to be this was and do chalk it up to them being massively busy and running out of food. But this dish WAS A TRAIN WRECK and I was steaming over the crunchy farro that was HARD to chew.  My husband had the jambalaya, he said the chicken in it was very dry and he thought all the ingredients were cooked separately and then just tossed together.  We were checked on when we were finished at that point I really didn't feel like bringing up the farro after that traumatizing pink drink.  My husband meant well and was sorry he picked this place for dinner.

A HIDDEN GEM OF SCOTTSDALE! located in a court area of the Seville Shopping Center. (no signs to let you know it is there)  Authentic French Bistro dining with real French staff featuring baguettes, crepes,quiches, Flammekueche (French pizzas), crosty (stuffed potatoes) and possibility the VERY BEST DESSERTS in Scottsdale.  The Bistro is quaint and charming with a large patio and the dishes are served on interesting plates. We decided to try crostys for lunch they came with interesting fresh salads served first. My companion had his crosty with sausage, provolone, Parmesan and mine was smoked salmon onions, cream fraiche & dill. Both potatoes came out piping hot and both were ooey gooey with cheese but potatoes were not fluffy and were brown on edges, also I wasn't excepting cheese on the salmon and would ask for no cheese if I ordered this again. So the lunch entree was really about 3 stars on this visit but dessert was on a level so much better I think 4 stars rounds it up.  The STAR of this lunch was the lemon mousse perfection in flavors, texture a perfect mouth feel and design,I have to say this is the VERY BEST mousse I ever had and if I came in for just dessert this would have been FIVE STAR Yelp. The mousse was a cut round in shape topped with a strong  shiny orange under it was the thick layer of intense lemon mousse that wasn't too sweet but perfect and under that was a thinner layer of chocolate mousse that reminded me of pot de creme but wasn't. If you dine near that dessert case you will get hypnotized and fall surrender to one of the many amazing desserts they all looked wonderful.  Service was very charming but clunky. Beverages ordered came after salad water was not refilled and we had to ask for check.  Slight update  Business has been sold to a new French Owners recently.

FABULOUS CAMBODIAN CUISINE!    Just like being on an exotic vacation tasting new flavors from top chef pretty platters in almost a Cambodian Museum .  This small restaurant is easy to miss depending on your direction driving here because the sign is only painted on one side of restaurant . Once you walk in you see a display of Cambodian relics including very old musical instruments , nick nacks  and visitor books on Cambodia on every table .  Our server was very friendly and welcoming and understood we needed a little time to decide .   I decided on the Loc Lak , it was pan fried beef cubes over a salad platter that came with  pickled green papaya and carrot salad , egg roll and steamed white rice . This dish was prettier than I can describe but it was also more tasty than I can describe as well . I tasted unusual flavors I never tasted before that were very good sort of tangy slightly garlic almost a mint flavor but not mint and a lingering honeysuckle note in my throat . The beef was very tender not fatty or oily one bit but it needs to be mentioned that it was a very small portion of beef my guess is two ounces . I also really enjoyed the green papaya carrot salad it was so light and fresh but also spicy , every thing on the platter was very light and fresh and a very nice meal overall .  My husband had the House Made Beef Sausage platter that also came with steamed rice , egg roll and pickled salad . This platter is a very generous serving of meat you get four sausages that are seasoned in a sweet and sour way and are very good .  We were EXTREMELY HAPPY with our visit and also spent VERY LITTLE the two meals only cost less than $20 we hope to visit again soon . Also a BYOB

Reathy Sekong is the only Cambodian Restaurant in town so it is the BEST CAMBODIAN Restaurant in town and also the worst Cambodian Restaurant in town. This is a small restaurant where you enter from the parking lot behind the restaurant. You see grape vines, fig trees and a big Italian looking dry fountain. Inside are all kinds of interesting Cambodian relics.  I had a wonderful meal here last time and was hoping to have another wonderful meal here again.   We started with a spring roll. The spring roll was large enough for two people and seemed freshly made and was tasty with the dipping sauce.  I specifically came across town to try the National Dish of Cambodia. The Fish Amok. After I ordered it the waiter told me the kitchen wasn't making it today. So I ordered something else real fast and just hoped it would be delicious.  I ordered the Chicken Kreung. It was basically a stir fry with similar seasonings that the Fish Amok was made of.  When I saw the dish I was VERY surprised to find a very large portion of chicken. I'm guessing it might have been eight ounces with fresh green beans and fresh red bell pepper slices. The last time I was here I think they only gave me 5 small chunks of meat that might have added up to only TWO ounces but it was a VERY DELICIOUS two ounces. Last time my husband enjoyed the Cambodian Sausage but it is no longer on the menu.  If you read my reviews you KNOW a peeve of mine is properly prepared chicken. I received CHEWY, RUBBERY Dark Meat Chicken in a Gritty, Paste-like, Oily Sauce that was saltier than I can handle. The sauce was heavily laced with lemongrass and also had lots of turmeric in it. Maybe the sauce is the way it is suppose to be and I just didn't like it?  However I can't justify anyone anywhere preparing of all things dark meat chicken that's DRY and RUBBERY. I don't know how it was prepared but seemed very leftover to me because it is very difficult to make dark meat chicken dry and rubbery.   My husband tried the Mi Keaw Noodle Soup. It came out almost COLD with two shrimp in it and SOGGY home made pork dumplings that busted open in the soup. (THAT IS A FAIL) My husband had to fish for the dry dumpling centers. The soup was not flavorful and just was an almost cold gooey mess. He also received a side of bean sprouts with wedges of lime in antique bowl that had chipping red paint that didn't seem sanitary to me.  The waiter was too busy to check on us and never asked how things were.  I don't know what happened in the kitchen. I don't think the same caring person was preparing the food as last time.   Maybe it just was an off day?  Last time was a BIG HIT this time was a big miss.

You might feel differently than me about this one and I give two stars because the majority of what I tried I couldn't take more than a tiny taste and for sure not a second bite  also a few things had to be spit out . Of course I couldn't try everything so maybe I missed what was good but in all that I tried I say in general much of the food was very overly bland or mostly just not right .  The best things about my trip here were the service all the folks working were very attentive and the place seemed nice and clean . As for food the sushi I tried seemed fresh , I passed on the buttered rolls , onion rings and fries but they looked good also at the end I did have a little ice cream and I tried the cheese cake they were good .  Here we go....  Cucumber salad was fresh but had cheap Italian dressing poured over it . The Salmon had a strange what looked like crushed maraschino cherries on top it was so odd I had to taste it...(that was a spit out) so over cooked it tasted like very dry fishy chicken breast I couldn't figure out the red stuff) They had something marked prime beef it was cooked very tender but lacked any seasoning that it desperately needed or at least a au jus or gravy . The pan of spinach was half melted cheese so when you tried to eat spinach you just got melted mozzarella cheese . The breaded tilapia was very strong tasting of fish (a spit out) It was unmarked but the either orange chicken or generals chicken didn't taste like either . The spicy chicken was just sweet no spice . The green beans were just in thick sweet sauce . They had breaded mozzarella sticks that were cold and when you bit in to them it was like biting into rubber .  But the stir fry was the funniest thing and maybe they just purchased the wrong beef and had the grill on too low because we picked a beef stir fry and they cooked up your vegetables and threw the beef on the grill and we noticed it was taking an unusually long time and we left it just taking the stir fry that tasted OK not great but OK about the time we were almost done the stir fry they run the beef to us and you have no knife to cut it and it wasn't fork tender so my husband picked it up and tried to bite a piece off and nearly tore out his teeth trying to eat it...(well that had to be spit out . Lastly the steamed rice was hard and crunchy and wasn't holding up well on the buffet .  Maybe because they are new they just don't have it together yet but this by far isn't 4 or 5 star quality from what I tried .

You don't have it your way, My husband got hungry and wanted more food , He's Italian and Italians from what I've been told don't eat mayonnaise. He asked for no mayonnaise on his burger. Of Course they Slapped on Mayo and I noticed and "  I  " said he wouldn't eat it to the worker there. Next my husband opened it up and saw the Mayo and told cashier he wanted his money back.   They were all frightened and shaky my husband didn't scream or do anything wild (although I thought he might, he just has that look) I thought the  innocent guy who slapped on the mayo was tearing.  The guy who took order just threw money out of the tip jar...WTF

Rita's Italian ice is an East Cost Regional Chain based in Trevose PA selling Italian Ice custard and Gelati and more.  The first day of spring (so far) they traditionally give out free regular size Italian Ice .  This new location just opened and till Tuesday (4-5-11) they are giving out free regular size Italian Ice till the official opening on Wednesday. (4-6-11)  We had the passion fruit and the chocolate ice and we had them topped with the really GREAT custards one vanilla the other chocolate they were really great and just like we remember from before .  This new Arizona location is different, a real walk in store not a window in a shack see what the shacks looked like at ritasice.com . The other difference is that this one is open year round!  It's about time Arizona got some Italian Water Ice!

Did a re-visit and it was NOT THE SAME AT ALL! and tossed our orange and pear water ice's out! they were watered down in flavor and the orange tasted fake ,they didn't taste like Rita's         WHAT HAPPENED?  I didn't try the custard this time ....so I hope that it is still good or this would have went down to one star

I must of been here during some sort of kitchen meltdown. I say that only because of the very good reviews and I KNOW NONE OF THEIR FOOD COULD HAVE TASTED LIKE MINE.  My whole experience was so bad it could have been a sitcom TV show.  We sit at a what could have been quaint table on the patio. The linen was crisp and clean. The glassware was spotless. The patio was cockeyed and the floor slanted and we just had to sit at an angle.I don't know if other patio tables here are like this but the two top one closest to the hostess stand is the one I'm talking about. It's the little table where you watch the people coming in.  I didn't think lunch would be terribly long so I thought it didn't matter but gosh if I was old I'd need a chiropractor for my hurt back. This was the most uncomfortable table I ever sat at in my whole life.  The iced tea I ordered tasted like bubble gum. ????????????  OK so now my back hurts and the iced tea is terrible but I'm still thinking things will be OK.  We wait and wait for our salads.  I decided to use the ladies room and gosh it was cold in there and if I had nuts they'd fall right off. HONEST it was like walking into a freezer. I guess women who are going threw hot flashes would love it.  We wait and wait and our waiter apologies to us and gives us refrigerator cold bread and ice hard cold but pretty swirled butter while we wait.  We finally get our salads AND THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD! But my chicken was dry ,it was so dry I think my throat could have gotten splinters and it's not just me being picky. My husband started eating my chicken and screamed about how dry it was. I think they cooked it for 45 minutes and that's what took so long. The salad looked beautiful but I couldn't eat it. A nice girl that worked there asked me about it and I told her the chicken was dry but I couldn't eat the salad because they didn't make the dressing right. I can't say for sure but I think the dressing was just oil with nothing else and it was horrible and not edible. This salad upset my stomach.  I did also speak to the manager who seemed concerned. The manager offered me dessert but I declined and he took $10. off the bill.  My husband said his shrimp were overdone and he wasn't sure if he had any dressing on his salad and thought he only had a little of the pesto from the shrimp on it.   I did notice several large parties were in while I was there and that must have been contributing factor of the problem with the preparation of my meal.  I'm sure they are not like this most of the time and it was just me being here at the WRONG TIME.  Weird tasting iced tea. uncomfortable table. Ice cold restroom. DRY not good Chicken. Beautiful salad maybe just oil as dressing.  Not for me.

The food we tried was wonderfully light, refreshing and all with bright flavors. We tried the shaken beef (filet mignon) and the lemongrass chicken. Both meals came with jasmine rice, side salad and scallion broth. The scallion broth sure didn't look like much but it sure was additive and you just needed to eat it.  Both meals really were scrumptious and it will be hard to order something else now. They had some kind of fried caramelized tiny crispy maybe scallions lightly tossed threw the meats that added to the delightfulness of the meals.  This place isn't as far out as I thought and was just fifteen minutes west of arrowhead mall. Service was very friendly and efficient.  As a slight update 9-17-12  I've been here twice since and enjoyed the vegetarian pho, the beef pho is not as impressive but is OK.  The side salads and scallion soup is excellent. So far I've noticed they are very good preparing proteins. Some dishes are more flavorful than others.

For over 30 years, Chef Ray Romeo's meticulous culinary preparation and presentation has delighted food enthusiasts, whether in a restaurant setting or in one of his catered events for the many charities he supports. Chef Ray Romeo has been the recipient of some of the most prestigious culinary awards in the industry. I am only one of the lucky many that has sampled much of his Masterful creations and his sauces are not to be missed since he is an expert saucier .  Dining here is a bit different, first of all the menu changes daily and most but not all plates are small plates to be shared in combination with each other also a mushroom bar with maybe a dozen different fillings and several sauces .  Today I just stopped by for lunch I ordered the grilled very flavorful chicken Caesar salad that was filled with chopped romaine, the tastiest focaccia croutons, house made dressing and Parmesan cheese and I picked up an Angus burger .   You will not find better food in this immediate area this place IS 5 STARS SPECIAL!  many of the small plates are approx $3-$7 (example pulled pork , grilled prime flank steak w/port wine reduction orange roughy w/lobster sauce)  sides like Mac & cheese with truffles $3 sweet potato mash $3  desserts $3 and fruit and cheese plates $6  On Sundays is an Omelet Bar  A nice outside patio is also here and leashed dogs are welcome .  As a very slight update (5-1-11) We were blown away by Dinner last night and I truly didn't Know how ingeniously original and utterly delicious the MUSHROOM BAR IS we shared Braised RAPINI large portabello mushroom and Italian sausage marinara mozzarella button mushrooms ,salmon cakes with sweet chili and black bean mango salsa, Mac & Cheese with truffles and the MOST incredible Chocolate dream dessert of bundt cake ice cream and fudge this dessert was only $3 it is worth 10-12 anywhere .  Everything was very good and very ULTRA  reasonably priced and Value priced wines are featured . I don't think they had an official grand opening yet but word of mouth has traveled and the place was packed . Full dinners will be added at some point to the menu .  NOTE I went before official opening and the Menu I had and posted was a pre-opening Menu and may or may not be the same in selection or pricing .No Dah this is an interesting and Unique experience but I did find service to be slow so I can ignore the minor eccentric ties and I think you might be glad you came since it so so reasonable priced and so much better than anything in this area I am overly enthusiastic about this place because nothing here comes  anything close to this so I hope this place is supported so it can stay in business because I AM PICKY and I REALLY do enjoy this place I hope I can go here for a long time because it truly is very good and NOT crappy like most places in this area....I am a supporter as much as I can about decent businesses in local areas and that is VERY HARD for me since I don't care for most .

The menu has expanded so you have many more goodies to decide on. More Nosh-ables (small plates ) Dinners and more. The chicken Marsala is absolutely delicious and was a nosh-able or a dinner when I was there an as a nosh-able it came with some yummy mashed potatoes. We also shared salmon cake sliders  (the salmon cakes were so light and nice) and flank steak  (cooked tender and flavorful with the most perfect gravy) nosh-ables.  I tried a Betty's Cosmo and that really was the bomb! very generous with Grand Marnier. (SCORE!)  The mini Creme Brûlée trio was delightful and well crafted.  I've been here many times because this is the VERY BEST food that I know of that you can get in this immediate area with a very nice ( Dog Friendly breakfast-lunch time) patio. (dogs not at dinner time)  Some of the other great things they offer are the MUSHROOMS, Sunday Omelette's , sandwiches and really the VERY BEST BURGERS (you will Thank me for suggesting these burgers the angus ones so delicious) that come with really delicious house made potatoes and the very best veggie burgers ever known to anyone so awesome they could win a prize.  service is very casual

Sumptuous fork tender Osso Bucco , Beautiful fresh Tuscan vegetables and Fresh Spinach Cannelloni made with House Made Pasta. This dinner was fantastic! I don't know of any other place in the area that even comes CLOSE to the great food I always get at Betty's Nosh. The specials are off the charts good and very reasonably priced. I was too full to have dessert but last time I tried the fresh daily made house ice cream and it was excellent.  Osso Bucco $18 Vegetables $5 Cannelloni $12  My pictures tell the truth.  4.5 stars   Slight update 9-23-12  My last several Dinners here have been five star experiences. I have received outstanding service from waiter James and the older lady that works for the school. You can see how good the food really is by my pictures.

I tried their signature dish called the Thai Basil. It wasn't awful but for me it was too out of balance in flavors. It did have a very nice spicy heat level and I liked that you could pick many proteins you don't normally see offered at Thai Restaurants. For me it really needed more basil flavor mostly because the three leaves they used didn't give it that full basil flavor. I thought it needed some garlic too. The other for me out of balance issues was that this dish was very sweet and oddly the broccoli seemed almost candied as it was even much sweeter than the sauce. I wonder if the broccoli was pulled out of another dish since it tasted so different? The other dominate flavor was soy sauce and that doesn't seem right to me. I know this dish is traditionally chicken but I picked salmon as a choice and salmon worked well as it picked up flavor easily but it wasn't the quality I like.  My husband tried the Thai Spicy Sausage. It came with rice, raw ginger, raw cabbage and peanuts. My husband said the sausage was good but this plate seemed disappointing and too plain. I don't think anybody eats raw ginger so it was odd that it was on the plate. It just was a really odd plate.  Next door is a really great gelato shop!

They now offer more things for me to try since my last visit .   The hot salsa tasted like can , I could taste can , it was canned smooth tomato product that was slightly spiked with something spicy . I tried the pico and I am not sure if the chopped tomatoes were frozen because they looked like frozen and thawed . The tomatoes were also unripe and the seasoning was unpleasant to me .   I will not fault them for the margarita since I didn't expect the best but the margarita tasted like dry mix .  As I mentioned in my last Yelp I didn't care for the seasoning of the chicken I had last time but I thought it was just me . I was afraid to order chicken again so I ordered a chili relleno . I took one bite and I didn't spit it out but I couldn't take a second bite either .  I only tasted pan oil . My husband tried it and he said it was awful and he felt bad  and said to try his food . I tried a piece of beef from his platter and it was just dry and tasted like it was just plain dry beef just soaked in jalapeño brine .   Maybe they are better at times and I was just unlucky with my visits .  I think it was one of the owners that asked me how everything was . I didn't have the balls to tell her . Would you?

Mike's cooking has been recognized with favorable reviews by "Phoenix Magazine", AZ Republic , New Times and has won AZ Best at least twice , Best of Phoenix , and Top 10 Restaurants in Phoenix . He has been in the food industry over 40 years and worked in South Africa , The Island of Crete and the Phoenix Restaurant Tomaso's before starting his own places .  His new place Just Opened and the menu is mostly sandwiches of Subs , Grilled  Panini's , Nann , Pita's , Quesadillas and salads . I was told dinners will be added sometime . He has taken over a former Quizno's location and the place still looks like a Quizno's .  We tried Grilled Panini's one was a Roasted Italian Style Pork with Caramelized Onions with Fontina cheese on hoagie roll the other was Reuben on marbled rye featuring House Cooked Corned Beef . Both sandwiches were ooey gooey yummy goodness and both came with the side of the day that was a tasty pasta salad  I do note Mike is a master of seasoning and what I tasted was extra special I never tasted pasta salad that was so tasty. I noticed on menu that many things are made in house such as mozzarella , cole slaw and corned beef .  The sandwiches are unique creative and good! this place is a GEM of this area! This gotta be among the Best Fast Casual Places Around! this area an honest to Goodness REAL sandwich shop !...I wish this was closer to my neighborhood's  I'd come more often.  This place is not average.....it is above average.....Very VERY GOOD!  slight update I was told the decor is slowly changing away from the Quizno's Look and within months new cooking equipment will be added for fresh baked bread and more cooking  Slight update....  1-14-12 Got to try for dinner,they now have a full dinner menu with some house made pasta and house made sausage.  I had the Myconos Chicken and it was delicious, the chicken was  tender juicy and flavorful with Kretikos Wine and came with tasty rosemary garlic potatoes. Only $10.99 and we brought in our own bottle of wine too. I also enjoyed a small greek salad that came with garlic toast. I saw some people were getting pizzas, they looked good. The place is a little prettier now and they play Greek Music. ....  UPDATE  Mike's Bistro is under NEW OWNERSHIP NOW, Not sure about changes and I hope the food is still as good as it was. !2-16-12

We tried the $4.95 lunch special , it was half sandwich with salad .  The Salumeria sandwich was assorted Italian lunch meats that were unusually mild for Italian meat and cheese that had little flavor . This sandwich seemed to  lack seasoning or dressing . The salad on the side was good .  I had the grilled chicken sandwich I did enjoy the taste of the char on the vegetables and chicken but  the chicken was dry , bread wasn't toasted and also this sandwich lacked seasoning and dressing . You might ask why didn't I just get up and ask for some vinegar and oil and my answer is after taking two bites I thought it wasn't worth getting up for a tiny end of sandwich ( this was a half sandwich ) . This sandwich even with grilled vegetables seemed very dry .They do say they are East Coast Style but  no hot Cherry Peppers in store can't be an East Coast sandwich without hot cherry peppers .   If you get a sandwich ask for your oil and vinegar on the side so you can add it if you feel your sandwich needs flavor .  I saw Rice balls  (arancini) and Stuffed Artichokes that looked really good in the case  and would have purchased to try at home if I was going straight home but I wasn't maybe I would have given more stars if that is what I tried . Two stars isn't saying don't go here .   I think this small comfortable casual place has potential so give them a try maybe they are still working things out .

The TRUTH is Freaky chemicals ARE ADDED to fortified the "healthy pizza"   I have a problem with no freaky chemicals are added as the website says but the truth is they do add probiotics to the crust.  We've recently tried the thin crust pizzas and found the crust flavorless sort of like a matzoh cracker but sort of like a tortilla with a burnt edge.  The sauce is almost flavorless , how do you take out flavor from tomatoes? I don't know? I threw my own seasonings on to make it taste better.  Mozzarella cheese that is lightly topping the pizza is almost flavorless.  I think this is extremely expensive considering you only get a (basically) 10in tortilla for $7.50 with almost nothing on it if you order one topping. This pizza wasn't filling one bit either for the first time in my life I ate a whole pizza. (I normally only eat one or two slices maybe three if I am pigging and the pieces are small)  We are not fans and my husband had high anger issues after trying this pizza he kept screaming to me to only give one star but I think maybe it deserves two stars?  only because it isn't as bad as others I've tried near here , at best I think this is only suitable for appetizers when you are having guest if you can't cook.  ALSO ONLY TAKE OUT OR DELIVERY no sit in dining

Nice and New Fresh Chinese Cuisine in the former location of the My Thai Restaurant. ( I miss My Thai )  I tried the Avocado Chicken that had vegetables of avocado , broccoli , water chestnuts , carrots , and squash. The textures were very interesting , who knew avocado would be great in a Chinese Dish? The chicken was very fresh and very tender the sauce was tasty but slightly sweet. I really liked the crispness of the squash .  My husband had the Black Pepper Beef with peppers , snap peas , onions , it came out and was poured on to a hot skillet and made a sizzling display . The beef was very tender not fatty,salty, or oily and the sauce tasted very beefy and  black peppery .  Our server  sensed that we would prefer the dishes more spicy and asked and then gave us two different hot chili's to add to our dishes to try , she was very attentive to us ,friendly and knowledgeable ,she was an awesome server.  The hot chili's elevated the dishes to us we will ask for spicy when we come here.  This nice new place is worth a try and is a Great Addition to our selection of restaurants to try in our immediate area.  This is NOT the same current ownership of the other Shangri-la Chinese Cuisine location.  7-24-11 as only a slight update we did make a second visit and ordered two different meals the hot spicy tangy beef and moo goo gai pan. We told our server (different person from last time) that our spicy meals were mild last time and we wanted extra spicy. They both came out extra mild and I know the moo goo gai pan is always mild anyway so I am not faulting any for that dish but Hot Spicy Tangy Beef should have been spicy  (the name of dish) and especially since we asked for extra spicy, so I think it is fair to say you will have a hard time getting spicy food here.  I am considering lowering this to Three stars but will give them one more try since they are new and maybe still working things out. 3-4 stars

The Gag Us Grill ......I gagged from the bamboo shoots and had to pick them all out because they tasted like tin from the tin can they came from so my bowl all tasted canned also the sauces I picked were too sweet.  I also don't think it is right that they charge you a dollar more at dinner time just because it is dinner time. (I asked the server if it is any different at lunch and she said no)  This stir fry place cost more than the independently owned one across the street .

We didn't want to eat at the food court at the mall and hoped that Genghis Grill would be better.  It's been FIVE years since I've been to Genghis Grill and it did change some.  Genghis Grill is a small casual Mongolian Stir Fry Restaurant with a bar. A hostess seats you and then you fill out a card with the size stir fry you want small, medium or large and your side that goes under your stir fry rice, noodles or cabbage.  We ordered some vegetable pot stickers. They came out pretty fast and did come with a tasty dipping sauce but the filling in the dumpling looked like it went through a blender. The pot stickers were the best part of our meal and they weren't so great.  I thought the ginger fish looked like the freshest choice for the protein so I picked that. The bowl is very tiny and I had little room for vegetables. The guy behind the glass said just pile it higher. After I tried to pile in some vegetables I selected some dry spice and a spicy red chili  stir fry sauce. Then I passed my bowl to the stir fry guy.   I went back to my table and in a bit the waitress brings us our stir fry. I look for some fish but I can't find one piece. I think it got chopped up real fine like rice. (ICK) I go to try a piece of broccoli. It's hard and got that bad broccoli smell and made me "GAG." My bowl is mostly rice with mashed up fish. It just taste awful. I was really starving but my stomach just locked up from trying this food.  My husband took different meats and used different spices and sauces than mine. He said his didn't taste good either and was convinced that mine must be better so he tried to eat mine. But he couldn't eat mine either.  Our server was cheerful and ok. She asked us if we wanted boxes for our leftovers, we declined and she just smiled.  I just don't know if it's possible to make a delicious stir fry here.  The food made us "Gag"   The Gag-us Grill  1.5 stars rounded up because the workers seemed nice.

Short Story - Not the Best.  Long Story based on just one lunch visit.  After years of just driving by I decided to try this restaurant after reading about the ten month renovations and seeing the Chef/Owner on TV. The on-line menu looked terrific to me so I thought this still might be a good choice.  We were only the second table of the day to enter the restaurant and the table I picked was filthy from the night before with crusty dirt. For my beverage I ordered an iced tea and the glass had a lot of dried soap residue on the outside but the tea didn't taste soapy so I didn't send it back.  I noticed the menu differed from the on-line menu and what I wanted to order wasn't on the menu so I went with the strawberry salad. I have to say the produce was very fresh and very good but the chicken tasted like processed chicken. It had that lunchmeat salty taste and texture. It's possible that it could have been over marinated real chicken but it did have that processed taste.I couldn't really enjoy it because the dressing was terrible and was mostly just oil. I dreaded the thought of asking for another dressing because I doubted any other dressing would be any better so I just ate it dry. I did notice my plate had soap residue and near the end my mouth felt like it was burning. I think I ate or drank some soap or cleaning chemical.  My husband ordered an antipasto salad and a slice of pizza. I took a bite out of the pizza and it lacked seasoning and left a weird strong after taste almost like blue cheese. I don't know what it was. His salad looked nice but was only BREAD PLATE SIZED at $13.00. His salad had lots of sun dried tomatoes in it but they weren't HYDRATED and were chewy like raisins.  I do also note much of the time the cook was seated in the dining room between cooking and was chatting with our server about stuff. He looked like a hippy boy from Whole Foods and didn't look presentable seated in the dining room.  Using the ladies room was an adventure. It was clean but the stall I picked was out of toilet paper so I went to use the next stall and that door doesn't lock or close all the way. I couldn't remove a roll so I went to grab paper and it had some weird mechanism were it only allows you to use a couple squares at a time.  After leaving the ladies room the Cook (hippy boy) was blocking the hall chatting with the server and I thought I'd have to push him out of the way to leave.   I did see the 2.5 Yelp Rating and was hoping it wasn't accurate as I don't always agree with the ratings.   Sadly the Yelp Rating for this restaurant seems very right on.

Based on the creativity of offering a FIG PINENUT and SPINACH PIZZA and making it with quality cheese I have to give four stars. This is an above average pizza.  The crust on my pie was crispy and I could taste salt in the dough but not too much salt. The cheese is good and taste like it has more flavor than just mozzarella but it is very thick. I think a few drops of olive oil might have been applied to the top of pie and I like the way the pine nuts got toasted on my pie. After I applied a light sprinkle of salt black pepper crushed red pepper and a pinch of garlic the pizza had a nice sweet to savory taste going on.  The spices that I noticed for you to add to your pizza were salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, grated cheese and garlic.  My husband had the sausage pie, he liked that the sauce wasn't sweet but would have preferred the pie seasoned.  The owner/pizza-maker seemed very accommodating and I am guessing he'd make your pie to your liking.

This is my saddest one star rated review ever only because the food could have actually been very good since everything was nicely flavored but what I received I find UNFORGIVABLE.  We started with a cheese plate and the first thing I noticed was the cheese all appeared to be cut far in advance from our ordering. The Tallegio cheese was also unlike any Tallegio cheese I've ever tried with a much milder taste and firm texture, disappointing but the real problem was THIS CHEESE WAS NOT CUT FRESH TO ORDER.  I went with the seafood special and it was so dry it was as if it was a left over that was over cooked again and it was a filet of fish that was cut in half resulting in an approximate three oz. portion for $29. I do note the sauce my fish was in was very good and the vegetables of carrots and matchstick asparagus were good BUT MY POTATOES were shriveled up and over cooked and when you cut them BROWN rings were threw them like old reheated over cooked potatoes. THREE OZ. OF DRY OVER COOKED (possibly multiple times) FISH with OLD SHRIVELED BROWN potatoes. I've reheated fish at home and it is never as good as fresh made but NEVER WAS IT CLOSE TO THIS DRY and I note the potatoes are not acceptable either.  My husband's pork shank was WORSE and was an unhealthy ICE COLD in the middle. The heirloom bean ragout seemed like canned garbanzo beans with some lentils and DIDN'T SEEM like a Heirloom bean ragout. I do note the sauce the beans were in was well made.  Our waiter did check on us and I told him about the dry fish and my husband told him about the Ice cold center of the shank. Our waiter did offer to reheat the pork shank but my husband he declined as he felt it would have taken so long it would have ruined the meal even more so.  When we received the bill, $12 was removed from the cost of my husband's pork shank. I was surprised no-one from management said a word to us. Our waiter also forgot to give us a bread basket but that wasn't a big deal but have to add that because I am upset over the food they felt is OK to serve.  I don't know if they are like this all the time or not but for sure I'd NEVER go back.

Based on just my lunch salad and a margarita Caldero is unique and above the average in Mexican Cuisine with a interesting and not average dinner menu. Many people who are not fans of Mexican might be fans here.  They have several non ordinary salads and I picked the Bass salad but they ran out so I went with the almond crusted chicken salad. It was just the right amount of chicken that wasn't heavy or oily, it was prepared nice. The salad also had jicama red peppers and pecans. The vegetables were cut nice and tasted well together. I picked the mango dressing and it wasn't sweet but savory and interesting, they also have a tamarind dressing.  I don't recall the name of the margarita I had but it was a tropical fruit one with a hint of habanaro pepper. The margarita wasn't really sweet but was flavorful sort of a peach kind of fruit flavor with sour and the mild hot pepper hit your throat at the end of your sip in a nice way. The margarita was large ($6) and does give a buzz.  I noticed marinated whole fish on the menu  and nut crusted stuffed chillies and slow cooked beefs on the menu.  Service was friendly and efficient.

They changed the menu and no longer have salads or the unique items I mentioned from 1-24-12 so we left. I don't think it is necessary to drop a star since my last meal was good.

Full of Great food IF YOU COULD GET TO IT! the placed was packed and full of CHAOS.  The SuperFarm Super Truck was one that made an extra effort to treat people nice running food to people in line. (maybe others did but I couldn't tell)  Band that I heard was good.  Bricks were on ground that people could trip on. (not too far from short leash dogs) this area was SARDINE SQUISH CITY.  AT LEAST WE WERE GIVEN WATER so you wouldn't choke on food.   Hopefully next year they will get it together but I'm skipping it.  we left early and went out to eat  Nov.2 slight update, after contacting them we received a refund

VERY GOOD PUMPKIN CURRY! Pumpkin was used to thicken the curry and chunks of pumpkin all though it! Even the white meat chicken was moist and good!                                                                                     YUM!  The Pad Gra Pow was delicious but lacked enough basil. It would have been perfect if it had enough basil. I would ask them to add on extra basil if I come back and get it.   We both ordered level 4 out of five for heat and one came out fiery hot and the other was pretty tame but tasty!   The Summer Rolls were very fresh but I'd skip them because I didn't care for the sweet teriyaki like sauce for dipping.  They also offer brown rice and sticky rice here.  Dining room is sort of lavish. It's very decorated with tapestry, drapes, dark carved wood furniture. Almost like someone's Grandmother's house. (If you have a Thai Grandmother)  They had a current grade "A" health inspection posted.  Service was quick and efficient.  VERY GOOD!  Worth a try when you're in the area!

The correct website for this location is www.jdvhotels.com/dining/distrito .  Parking cost $10 but you can get a validation that takes $5 off the parking charge.  I made our reservation early since I read about a Happy Hour to try. (Monday-Friday 5pm-7pm) I was very Happy that the Margarita tasted GREAT but I was somewhat disappointed that happy hour only means ordering off the menu as is, so after a round of drinks we went to our table.  The dining room is a fun mix of bright colors texture and sparkles with tables close together.  This is Tapas dining so you need to order several small plates to share, several people told us at least two three or four per person or to order Chef's Tasting Menus.  Chips and guacamole were suggested often to us but we concluded we would prefer ordering more unusual items off the menu rather than filling up on ($7) chips and salsa, we finally decided and ordered.  The ONLY negative thing I can say about the food is about the first plate we started with, the Hamachi Ceviche . The ceviche was excellent and absolutely delicious but I do have to say the portion was only MAYBE one half oz. of fish TO SHARE and the tiny scoop of sherbet was less than a half teaspoon TO SHARE. Our server asked us is we wanted to order another one but at $12 a pop that is crazy.   Huarache De Hongos was outstanding, I've tried corn smut before and didn't really enjoy before but here it was completely different to me , absolutely delicious . (this was a vegetarian earthy mushroomy sort of flat bread)  We tried a chicken taco plate and received three very stuffed two inch tacos that were very tasty and good.  The carne en adobo came out with a tasty crust was fork tender and juicy  (correctly fatty ) with a yummy sauce.  We didnt receive side tortillas and extra sauces but another yelper mentioned they did? 't...we... shared the large that is nine oz. to share, the small is four oz. sized.   For our side dish we picked the Esquites - sweet corn queso Fresco chipolte lime , this maybe was the most layered in flavors out of everything we tried,it really was out of this world, it really popped.  Our Service was OK the servers all seemed knowledgeable but it was somewhat uncomfortable with a staff of about twelve servers standing with backs against the walls all watching like hawks at the few diners dining. The Servers were quick to soar in as you were trying to finish plates sometimes they came in before you were done.  I was considering only giving three stars since I am down on the Portion of Hamachi Ceviche, The Happy Hour and the parking charge. 3-4 Stars

For sure Jasmine Tokyo is an above average Asian Buffet. After sampling a variety of offerings you can have a very good experience if you zero in on the dishes you like. The high lights for me were the spicy salmon rolls because they weren't the mayo upped kind you get at the budget places. The spicy fish on watermelon chunks was really awesome. I would have preferred the sushi to be smaller in size or with less rice but still the sushi was above average. I liked the great selection of fresh vegetables. The entrée I liked the most was the tofu stir fry with bok choy.  I was very pleased in general but since it's a buffet it can't be five stars in my opinion because proteins that I tried were a little chewy or overcooked but still much better than your average Asian Buffet.  I'd go back.  I think the dinner price was $21.99

I knew that going to a new restaurant on opening day would have some hiccups in service and possibly food preparation. That said we decided to try Barrio Queen for lunch today. The idea of ordering at the window and having a seat outside was a nice idea for a lunch on a sunny afternoon While ordering it was evident that the woman taking our order was very unfamiliar with the extensive menu.  No problem! We persevered and slowly went through the menu items and got the order placed. The server was very friendly and apologetic for the time it took. this was not a big deal.  It was time to pay and off to our table we went to await the fantastic sounding food we ordered.  W ordered 4 tacos 1 salmon y Mango, 1 Chorizo, 1 Barrio Pollo and 1 arrachera y relleno.  We also ordered what we believed what we believed would be the star of the day, The masa azul quesadilla with Huitlacoche " the mexican truffle" .  The 4 tacos arrived and where each truly unique and different. I also didn't get the same plate representation that DAVID L. posted and didn't get side dishes of sauces. (I know HICCUPS) While they were delicious the arrachera y relleno seemed to have lost its relleno.  Oh well opening day hiccups, not something to worry about as it was still very good.  Then came the Huitlacoche quesadilla. We have had huitlacoche a few times and really like its flavor.  The menu describes the quesadilla as served with quesillo cheese, sautéed onions, roasted pepper mix and of course huitlacoche.  When it arrived at our table the server identified it as a quesadilla champinon.  We asked her about the huitloche and she corrected herself and said thats what we had and she misspoke. Upon examination what we had was a quesadilla containing cheese, sautéed onions and button mushrooms. No sign of the pepper mix or the Huitlacoche.   My husband returned it to the window and the woman was very sorry and said she would get us what we ordered.  She took the quesadilla.  A few minutes later she came to the table and said what we had was huitlache.  When we disagreed she offered to get the manager.   The manager came to our table and he told us what we had was huitlacoche.  My husband told him we knew what huitlacoche was and that it was grown on corn and was a purplish black color and that our quesadilla was only onions, mushrooms and cheese. No huitlacoche or anything that resembled it.  His only reply was that is what huitlacoche is.   He then said he wouldn't charge us for it.  Nice since we had already paid! he then said he would get it taken care of.  We finished our margaritas and left never seeing him, our $8.00 or our incorrect quesadilla again.   Based on the quality and taste of the tacos I would be glad to recommend this place, however after the conversation with the manager I can not return.  He was confrontational and actually insisted we had something that we clearly did not and implied we just didn't know what we were talking about.  Since the server had taken the quesadilla we had nothing to show him.  As far as I am concerned that management mentality will not work its way out the like the service hiccups probably will.

We had a terrific meal here!   It was hard to decide on what to order because they offer a nice variety of plates you don't see everywhere with many irresistible side option choices.  I went with the Blackened Fish Sandwich, the fish they offer differs between a few and is red fish sometimes but on my day it was Maui Maui. My side I picked was fresh green beans with olive tapanade and feta cheese. Everything on plate was delicious, the fish was prepared perfect on an above average artisan bun with a tasty slightly spicy sauce and some toppings and I thought my side was above average too it was also prepared perfect and seasoned very nicely.  My husband went with the shrimp po boy. He said it was also delicious and prepared perfect but could have used a little more shrimp. He couldn't decide on one side so he picked two and had to have the dirty orzo and the jalapeno cheese grits. He said they were awesome and we have to come back to here again.  I was full but we wanted to try dessert and went with the house made apple pie because it was a special offering that they don't have all the time. They bring out a large slice that is plenty for two people dressed with caramel and vanilla gelato. I liked that the pie had a super thin crust and the apples were cooked well and nicely seasoned but for my taste the crust was a little doughy but it still was good.  Service was fantastic!  A very solid four stars!

The food is HUMBLE and features some Jalisco dishes that many people are looking for,such as Bistec, Mole, Menudo, Birra, and Posole. My meal I had recently here was Steak Poblano. The steak was fork tender and covered with fresh tomatoes , Poblanos , & onions .Everything seemed fresh and the place was very clean. They make their own tortillas here daily and Howard Seftel had them on a top ten list according to the menu here.  Meals that I tried so far have been carefully made  and were not greasy.   Service is usually good, but sometimes it goes European Style. (your order gets taken,food comes out and that's it.....that is how it rolls. It's a Mom and Pop business.  3.5 stars

I was hesitant about trying this buffet because I didn't care for the food from the metro location but I asked the person at the hostess stand and she assured me that this buffet was under a different ownership.  Last week the food was really decent and a few things like the prime beef and the rib eye were surprisingly good. I really couldn't find anything wrong with the food last week with a small exception to the rockfish and was happy that it was decent but thought I needed to wait for a second visit since it's a buffet to do a Yelp review.  I don't know what the problem was last night but almost everything was a fail.  All the sushi had leathery fish, the fish was sort of dried out and like leather so I couldn't eat any because I thought I'd get sick. All the sushi fish was like that.  The rib eye was tasty last week but last night it had no flavor.   I tried to cut a piece of the one steak with the serrated knife but couldn't cut threw it so I knew I wouldn't be able to eat it.   So next I tried to eat the prime beef since it also was tasty last week but last night it wasn't the same and I couldn't eat that one either.  The salmon was awful and I never tasted anything like that before, when you tried to eat it the fish turned to paste and liquified in your mouth and it didn't even seem like fish.  I tried to eat the spicy chicken since this one was really good but a little oily last week. Last night the spicy chicken was even oilier and didn't have the tasty sauce on it but it was spicy.  The chicken sticks were over fried so I couldn't eat them.  I don't know what they did to the chicken with broccoli but when you tried to eat the chicken it turned to a paste (just like the salmon did) and I found that not to my liking to say the very least THE VERY VERY LEAST.  Green beans were oily.  I tried the Hibachi Rice and maybe one or two spoonfuls were ok but then I hit something added that wasn't suppose to be in it and had to remove it from my mouth. I don't know what it was since it didn't even taste like food.  The rock fish was better than last week and tasted OK but I was only able to get a teaspoon's worth since it was just bones and skin left. Last week the rockfish was fishy tasting so I thought I just didn't like rockfish but now I think that one last week wasn't the freshest.  The Mongolian stir fry vegetables were good.  The fruit was good.  The cheese cake was frozen solid.  My husband wanted a refill on his soda and waited and waited and got up to get it himself. Our server had over thirteen tables and the server  from the next station over to her was complaining about not having any tables.  This was really one star to me but I am giving two stars since they are new and maybe were just having an off night or maybe this is just how they are now?

Short Story  Two of the pastas we tried were very thick and heavy with a paste like texture and flavors were disappointing.  Long story  We were excited to try this place again after reading all the great new reviews. We were welcomed nicely by the hostess and our servers were very cordial and efficient and we were surprised by a tasty amushe bouche of  olive oiled crustini with a light spreading of cheese.  We had a hard time deciding on what to order because really only one traditional type dinner plate was on the menu so we ordered a cheese plate while we took some time to decide. We received delicious crusty bread with high quality olive oil and the cheese plate adorned with very good accompaniments.   We had the pasta fagioli soup. This variation of soup was made with dark beans and seemed to not include the usual seasonings and vegetables such as tomato, celery and onion and the stock. The soup seemed extremely rustic and mostly was just  cooked beans. The pasta in it looked like rolled by hand orecchiette, each one was very heavy and thick regular flour pasta that had a paste like texture.  The peach and arugula salad was very good and large.   We ordered the one dinner plate of the evening that included roasted chicken legs and thighs, Shriner's sausage, cold potato salad and pickles. The chicken was OK, The sausage was a little over grilled. The potato salad wasn't delicious.  We also ordered the eggplant strozzapreti also know as priest choker pasta. Again just like the pasta from the soup this pasta was also a hand rolled regular flour pasta but the shape of strozzapreti is an elongated cavatelli shape. Each piece of pasta was approximately the size and heaviness and thickness as a solid green bean. After I ate one I really didn't feel up to any more. I did pick the vegetables out and ate them.  I thought even with improvements this visit was a step down.   If we made different selections we might have had a more positive experience.

I heard about the recent changes and I thought we should give this place another try.   Everything we had THIS TIME was very well crafted and made with the finest local ingredients. The prices were also very reasonable for this kind of quality and the portions were more than we needed.  The pasta e fagioli was made with assorted heirloom beans including scarlet red runner beans and the pasta was well crafted and al dente. The soup was made really well.  I had the chicken salad plate. The chicken salad was made with this really well developed dark meat chicken that was cooked so perfect it was a joy to eat. I think it had a little mustard and oil holding it together and it had tiny pieces of green apple and pecans though it making it tasty and delicious. I really enjoyed the vegetable salad on my plate. It was made with heirloom fancy red carrots and heirloom radishes , fresh crunchy cabbage , and parsnips. The vegetable salad seemed light and tasty. On the other end of my plate was fingerling potato salad. The potatoes were warm creamy texture and sort of mustardy. Overall I was very impressed with this $10.00 dish as it far exceeded my expectations.  My husband enjoyed the grilled mortadella and braised cabbage sandwich. The flavors went together well and this sandwich came with a salad. $9.50.  I liked that they got rid of the community tables and made that area a bar.  Unlike my other visits here Chef Bianco was in the house and everything prepared was perfect. I hope when he is not there that his place will run just the same.

MOSTLY FULL PRICE MEALS   VERY LIMITED TWO DOLLAR SAMPLES       To prevent choking hazards water should be provided.  Parking lot was unnecessarily muddy.    Food Shows should held in convention centers.  Had hopes of sampling different trucks, purchased one $10 meal that we didn't care for so we trashed it and went out for a nice lunch. Happy that we arrived and left early lines were still OK.

I thought it would be lots of fun to try the food from the Spice It Up Food Truck. They specialize in Flavorful International Food. We enjoyed watching them on the Food Network's The Great Food Truck Race and were hoping that they would win because everyone said their food was delicious and they won many of the challenges on the TV Show. I also felt good about ordering food here and had no fear about them being a "roach coach" because they displayed a current grade "A" Maricopa Health Code Inspection.  We ordered three things to share.  Chicken Tikka Masala - The white meat chicken in the dish was moist but the sauce was oddly mild and mostly tasted like tomato. The crisp was tasty but greasy and the dish was about 75% rice.  Lentils- Very nice presentation but again very mild with little flavoring. Not bad.... but after a spoonful or two... there was no reason to go on. Again about 75% rice.  Thai Red Curry - Lots of fresh crisp vegetables BUT NO SAUCE AT ALL. DRY CHICKEN only mildly scented with curry flavors. NO HEAT AT ALL. About 50% rice. EPIC FAIL  If you prefer your food without heat and on the bland side you will find the food delicious.  They sure need to live up to their name and SPICE IT UP!

Closed clams have been dead for an unknown period of time and are unsafe to consume and that is what they gave us in one of the dinners. I didn't even complain about the missing eggplant in the eggplant caponata that should have been included with the sunfish dinner but I note EGGPLANT WAS MISSING. The sunfish dinner was cooked nice and had the taste of eggplant caponata without the eggplant. We ordered focaccia so we could get some bread and we got four two inch by two inch ( approximate ) thin pieces for four dollars that was tasty.  We did alert our server about the closed clam and someone came out and apologized and presented us with a dish of cooked clams. A closed clam can infect the whole dish and has the potential to make someone sick.   If we didn't have the clam problem I would have given three stars because it was just OK.  I don't want to go to anyplace that would serve someone a dead clam on top of their dinner I will not be back and am thinking I should have given one star.

If I base my review on just the tacos at their price point two stars is accurate.  Their were lots of things I did like about SOL Mexican Cocina. They present you with above average salsas and and spiced toastadas. The margaritas were good and strong but maybe pricey.  ($10.50 and $13.75) I loved the warmed goat cheese with salted peanuts and that sweet hot chipotle syrup it was like whipped cream cheese but tastier and all that sweet salty and spicy went really well together. It is worth coming here just for the goat cheese. The grilled corn was good! Not the best I've ever had but GOOD!  They are accommodating to vegans and vegetarians. Service is above average as our server Amanda was very knowledgeable and informative and seemed well trained.  Now the tacos.  The tacos are Baja style street tacos. They are very small tacos.  My husband had the sampler plate and I ordered two ala carte tacos so together we tried five kinds.  We tried chicken, beef, pork, fish and vegetable. For the most part the tacos were just meh but the stand outs were the pork and fish tacos. We spent $30.25 on 8 MINI TINY tacos. The chicken was the most undesirable but passable. The chicken was sort of dry and not so tasty. The beef one could have been more flavorful but was OK. The vegetable (corn & rajas) taco was full of just mooch as it lacked flavor and texture. The wild caught fish taco was yellow tail on my visit. The tiny taco was tasty but the fish was over cooked ($7.50) and it seemed expensive to me for such a tiny taco with very little fish in it.   Your best bet is to come for Happy Hour and take advantage of it.

Brad Garrett is hysterical and if you are old you might pee your pants. I thought one of the other two comedians was funny too. They don't make you buy drinks like at most places. We purchased some wine and it wasn't awful but it wasn't good either it was just drinkable. They add the tip on so you don't have too. The only food they sell is pre made pop corn.

My last two shopping trips have been unpleasant. Last week I purchased the Wild Sockeye Salmon for dinner. It looked good I thought but when I unwrapped it the fish was unpleasant smelling and felt slimy so I returned it the next day.   Today I saw them loading up the fish counter with Lots Of Sockeye Salmon. This time I thought some of the fish didn't look fresh and the PLACE STUNK AND SMELLED JUST LIKE LEE LEE's.  Then I went to check out and I didn't feel like waiting a half hour as the two lines open had families with multiple carts filled all the way up so I did the self check out and that was fine.  The wheels on my cart locked two aisles before the yellow line. So I had to drag my cart out from in front of someone's car. Grab my bags and the one bag falls apart on me and my stuff falls to the ground. A guy in the lot told me those carts do get out of sync sometimes.  So BRING YOUR OWN BAGS!  The Fish MIGHT be spoiled!  Be Prepared for your cart to suddenly lock it wheels before you get to your car.

If you like Belgium Style Chocolates, Fresh Baked Pastries, coffees, teas, smoothies breakfast or lunch this place might be for you! This friendly but very small place also sells some hard to find British dry goods. Some of the breakfast and lunch specialties are, English Style breakfast,  Cornish Pasty and Cotswold Pie.   We shared two of the lunches. The pasty had a very tender crust and was filled with tasty ground beef and vegetables. This meal came with a very large fresh regular salad.   The sandwich named, "Best Grilled Cheese Ever" Turned out to be the best tasting Vegetable with cheese sandwich I ever had! This sandwich was more vegetables than cheese but was on  tasty, nicely toasted white rye bread. This sandwich also was made with tasty sauces that just made it delicious.  Had to share a dessert so I picked the double baked almond croissant because I never seen a dessert like that before. It was made of many light layers of pastry, stuffed with an almond cream and topped with more decadence,  It was a very rich dessert but was masterfully made.  As we were leaving the server INSISTED we try a chocolate since we never were here before. I picked the milk chocolate with macadamia nuts. The chocolate was very creamy and delicious and so smooth. I won't be able to eat store bought chocolates now after Rayner's Chocolate.  What a Treat!  You should Check Rayner's out if you can!

I was here maybe two weeks back and they were open with almost no gelato the pans were empty and some had one scoop of gelato in them.  Here's the Scoop-  The chocolate taste like those budget chocolate ice cream cups that only a kid could eat.  The pistachio doesn't taste good. I should have left after the pistachio tasting. The coconut seemed good after trying the other two you do get some real coconut in it but after a another taste you could taste the extract flavoring and it wasn't good.  You might want to give them a try (but I won't again) because the next closest Gelato that I know of is maybe a half hour drive.

DOG Gone it the meal was PAWS-itively filled with unexpected surprises and masterful execution. It was something to YELP about.  You will BARK about having a great meal here if you share a bunch of small plates. Many of the plates come in small or regular sizes. The prices are very reasonable with one of the small plates starting at just $3.  We started with these really great Sazerac CockTAILS. They were so good we couldn't help not to LAP them up. It was outstanding and a very strong $10. drink.  Who doesn't like to WOLF down Blistered Miso Shishito Peppers and a small size Small Family Farmed Cheese Plate served at the perfect eating temperature with very tasty house made saltines.  The Elote Style Corn was so fresh and was something to HOWEL about. The corn tasted like fresh corn you'd get from a farmers market and found out if did come from local McClendons Farm.  Another TAIL WAGGER is the Jerk Cured Scottish Salmon. The flavor of the potato complemented the jerk seasoning with the salmon that was truly unique.  The Kimchi Pork Belly Siders might give some people a new LEASH on life. They make you a little nuts because they have peanuts on them.  We ended the meal sharing one Massive BBQ'd Beef Rib over Blue Cheese Grits. I feel like a HEAL saying this but it didn't say on the menu that it would be topped with a pickle fruit. It came out with pickled peached and I didn't mean to pick a BONE with anyone but we had to send it back since my husband has a peach allergy. LICK-ity split the Chef sent out another and graciously apologized for not noting that on the menu. The Short Rib really was the most MASTER-ful Rib I ever had anywhere. Not only was it caramelized meaty and succulent. it also had this chewy leather meaty coating around it that was awesome with those great BBQ smokey flavors. I usually don't eat ribs because they are too fatty for me as this one was in places for me and I note for other people it might be too fatty but for some people this is bliss and what they are looking for. The top or curved part of the rib is the less fatty part and I could eat from there and what I ate from there I really enjoyed and can appreciate how good it really was. The Blue Cheese grits really went well with the rib and were really great. It's a shame I had to pass on the picked peaches.  I felt like CHASING the waiter down for one of those interesting desserts that they have here but when he presented the dessert menu I just had to MUTT-er I was too full to cram in dessert and had to take a WALK.  I don't mean to be a little RUFF but Blue Hound Kitchen and CockTAILs might leave you STAY Hot under the COLLAR in a Good Way.  1-15-2015 Chef has changed since my visit.

I'm not sure if I'd give four stars for dinner because I only had lunch here but lunch  really was ABOVE AVERAGE FOR SURE! We ordered two sandwiches that were well crafted, had some above average ingredients and just where something special that you don't get at too many other places.  I had what they called a tea sandwich. It's not what I think a tea sandwich is but whatever it was it was darn good. It was made of house cured salmon that was prepared very nice and wasn't fishy at all and more like butter in your mouth. The pickled cucumber radish salad with sprouts cut the richness of the fish and marscarpone cheese. They didn't use cheap common radishes but pretty heirloom ones.The bread was very fresh and was toasted absolutely perfect. This sandwich was very well crafted.  My husband had the short rib sandwich. The meat was developed with flavor and cooked down still being rich. They used spinach, heirloom tomatoes and those  pickled cherry peppers that are a REAL TREAT to find in Arizona. The short rib sandwich came with fries.  Both sandwiches really were very good but if I can be knit picky I thought both were a bit heavy on the bread to filling ratio. I ate the tea sandwich open faced. I thought it was enough food but it would have been nice if the tea sandwich came with something like a chunk of fruit.  Very nice comfortable patio.   Very nice treat for lunch!

I am undecided between four and five stars so I went with five because overall this second very good experience exceeded my expectations.  We started our dinner with happy hour prices and got a pretty good bottle of wine half price for almost what it cost you at the store and those tasty Haloumi Cheese stuffed cherry peppers for only $4.00.  We went with burgers for dinner and I have to say my nearly perfect burger was the most delicious burger I ever had out and is deserving of a more fitting name like maybe Mary Poppins, Practically Perfect in Every way! I tried what they named the sweet chili Burger. This burger doesn't need cheese or bacon or even sauce to make it taste good. This burger was really different and creative with layers of flavors and the perfect bun to meat ratio. The roll was buttery fresh and lightly salted and never fell apart while eating the sandwich. The delicious patty is made of Short rib , sirloin , chuck and brisket and is also seasoned. Toppings were pickled fresno chiles ,onions , cucumbers and under the patty were greens. This combination was a flavor bomb! My only minor criticism is the patty seemed a bit dense and maybe the meat was packed too tight. The side I picked were the mixed vegetables and they were beautiful above average vegetables including broccolini and wax beans. I really enjoyed this burger.  My husband enjoyed the Kelly's Original Burger and had the tasty perfect onion straws with it.  I also purchased a Kelly's local dines dot com certificate and saved a good amount of the bill with that too.  That seems like an overall five stars to me.

I would have giving another star if the burgers were cooked correctly. I think if mostly all you do is burgers they should be cooked the way you asked for and we were the only table they were cooking for at the time. We ordered two burgers and asked for one medium rare and the other medium. The medium rare one came out rare. The medium one came out medium well. So both of us were slightly disappointed but being one off we could manage and didn't want to waste time having one thrown back on.   The burger I had seemed to be seasoned nice with a slight charr. About half the people are like me and will only eat half the roll because that's too much bread to eat. I thought the house made garlic knot was good and not too garlicky with the burger. (but I only ate the smaller half not the whole roll) But my companion eat the whole thing and said all together it was too much garlic so it can go either way.  The truffle string fries are OK but don't didn't taste truffles on our visit. Maybe they left it off or maybe they use real truffle oil that's very delicate? Usually if you taste a lot of truffle flavor it's artificial truffle aroma. So that may be a good thing that we didn't taste the truffle.  We both had margaritas and I'd pass on them them next time as they were large and too much mixer in proportion to booze.  Two burgers that came with the fries and two margaritas about $40.00 before tip.

I needed to stay around terminal A and gave Modern Burger a try. They do pre made salads that look tasty and I had a Chinese Style Chicken Salad in my hand I was about to get and changed my mind thinking a fresh made breakfast burger might be better. I may have been expecting too much since I was expecting a yummy burger tasty like a Zinburger. But what I got was more like a really good fast food type burger. Like what a Whopper Jr might be like if it was good. It was a very thin small patty maybe the same size as a Whopper Jr beef patty I guessing a two oz. patty. I do note the patty was cooked nice but not so tasty. The bun was soft and eggy tasting but a lot of bread for the little patty that didn't fill the bun. My egg slice was cooked very hard and was chalky. It was sort of messy with thousand Island dressing squirting out all over.  Depending on how you look at it the burger was really good if you compare it to a Whopper Jr but it cost like 5x more or it's lousy if you compare it to a burger you cooked in a pan or on the grill.  I should have went with the Chinese Style Chicken salad with canned oranges on it.  2.5 Stars

I received a coupon to come in and try them because they were open. We were looking forward to trying this mid eastern style place. I saw the big banners saying they were open. We walked in and were Thrown Out at approximately 5:30 because they reserved the place for a party. Not a soul was there and they wouldn't even let us sit in the bar. My first impression wasn't a good one. The woman asked us to come back tomorrow. If they put a note on the door I would be more understanding. I hope they let YOU in when you make the trip.

POOR SERVICE , BAD DRINKS , and SPOILED FOOD.  I do note the poor service was NOT the waitress's fault as she alone was waiting on close to fifty people all by herself.  We looked at the wine selection and decided to go with mixed drinks so we ordered a mojito and long island iced tea. When the drinks arrived we tasted them and they nearly tasted the same. Both tasted mainly of budget artificial lemon aid drink mix. Nether of us could stomach these drinks. The drinks were truly horrible.  We ordered two appetizers, the falafels and the Lebanese Muhammara (spicy red pepper and walnut  dip). I thought the dip was good but the falafels weren't really made right. They were fluffy but had hard things in them that might have been chunks of uncooked hard beans?, unless it was something nonfood?  I was afraid I might break my teeth eating them.  Our dinners arrive and when I took a bite out of the salmon it wasn't right. The salmon was past not fresh and was spoiled. My husband confirmed it as spoiled. The waitress is running around with lots of tables and never comes back. I am left with a plate of spoiled fish to look at. I nibble on the few vegetables I have and notice they cooked some of my tomatoes but added a RAW tomato to plate. (see photo) My husband gives me some food off his plate so I'd have some dinner.  On the cleopatra plate the Kafta had good flavor but was dry. The Chicken was flavorful and good. The filet mignon was so overdone it was dry , chewy and tasteless and didn't even taste like beef with no beef flavor left in it. The plate was came with a little cup that I thought might be hummus but turned out to be unmelted garlic butter.  If somebody puts a gun  to your head and makes you come here for dinner get the chicken kabob.  The waitress arrives and ask if I want a box for my plate. I told her no because the fish was spoiled. She told the management and nobody said anything to me but my meal was removed only because I had a buy one get one coupon.  You won't see any belly dancers either unless you eat dinner at 9pm or later.  This is a new business and I hope they work things out and improve because we have very few nice places to dine at in this part of town.  BUT I NEVER imagined the first time I was here and didn't eat would be the better of my two visits.  I do feel slightly bad but not completely.  My thoughts are I can't forgive about spoiled fish they didn't care about but I did enjoy the chicken and the pepper dip.   But bad management can spoil a place as we know.

Maybe you need Durian fruit for that special someone? Or how about Jelly Fish in an instant? Fresh duck eggs, quail eggs or canned quail eggs? Produce ,meats, grains and fish you don't find everywhere. Or maybe YOU JUST WANT TO HIT THE ONE ASIAN MARKET that DOESN"T SMELL yet at this time.   I also noticed a new PHO  and Grill restaurant is coming on the corner.

I had to return the Fish I purchased for dinner just a few hours ago because it smelled bad. I was not able to smell bad fish over the counter. This place still smells clean. This is the second spoiled fish purchase for me from here. The manager said yes that fish smells so the fish monger knowingly gave me bad fish.   I will still stop in for produce or dry goods because I like them here but I can no longer trust them for fish.

Many small and interesting plates to try. I'd say you need to order about four plates for a couple to share. The place is sort of hip and the wait staff is groovy. You listen to an interesting selection of music while dining. We started the roasted cauliflower steak topped with yummy roasted chickpeas that  cauliflower really looked like a steak when it was whole. This was the one dish that really wowed us with a great range of flavors it also had a nice twang to it. Next came the roasted corn , walnut , pecorino , arugula and mushroom salad. This was a HOT salad out of the pan. The mushroom had a great caramelization and the corn was clearly fresh. The salad was nice but didn't pop. The Saturday's Chef Whim was risotto topped with shaved truffles so we tried it. The execution of the risotto rice was perfect, the style of this risotto was rich with butter and cream, the flavor screamed of truffle possibly aroma. I asked what kind of truffle shavings were used and was told Umbrian. For dinner we shared the flat iron steak. The steak was half well and half medium rare and was very small like everything else. The very sweet saba mushrooms had a very good caramelization but really were too sweet for both our taste. The radish was different but was like a raw radish and when I tried to cut one the half flew into the air so I couldn't eat them the way I wanted. For me the steak was the least successful dish. We did share a dessert and the dessert really was up there with the cauliflower. We tried the spicy brownie sandwich stuffed with HOUSE made pistachio gelato that was garnished with REAL fresh made whipped cream and very tasty brittled peanuts. It was a winner.  Some hits, some misses. I am really torn between three and four stars but went with three because of the steak. I think the main meal of the evening should be the one that impresses you.  Davanti Enoteca is really worth a try.  3.5 stars  As only a slight update, I was undecided between 3-4 stars based mainly because of the steak.  But after thinking about it I figure the bold red wine I was drinking went terribly wrong with that plate. I'm not a wine expert and one normally thinks bold red wine goes with steak. But this plate was hard for me to pair so I was thrown off with the sweetness in the mushrooms. Not sure but I am thinking a riesling might have been the right one because of the sweetness being more sweet than mushroom taste. When you pair wine correctly your meal is enhanced but pairing the wrong way spoils it.  I also forgot to mention plates were well timed.  A solid 4 stars with potential to be 5 stars !

I've been here before and I enjoyed the unique starter plates very much and again for Restaurant Week I enjoyed a new one. I had the cauliflower steak before and it doesn't disappoint it's a delicious combination of flavors and textures that work together really well. The cauliflower is caramelized, the chickpeas are roasted and nutty tasting with some texture. They use olives for that twang taste and you get that slight almost ceaser dressing taste threw it. It's very good.  We also shared the Truffle Egg Toast with Fontina Cheese and asparagus. It comes out as a thick piece of toast with melted cheese topped with two egg yolks that someone cuts up for you at the table. The toast is surrounded with slices of white asparagus. This is one of those oozy gooey yummy dishes that most people love. I usually don't care for white asparagus because of it's strange texture and lack of taste but in this application it's perfect and adds the right texture to the dish and absorbs the flavors.  For dinner I had the wild salmon. I liked that they crisped the skin really well and the fish was seasoned nicely. The spring vegetable ragu was an interesting combination that looked like it was made of farro and pea green tops and other vegetables. This side ran on the sweet side for me. The plate was also decorated with whipped fava beans.  My husband had the Pork Porterhouse he said it was great.  We both picked the Gelati for dessert and our waiter didn't bring us the exact flavors we requested but we had a large assortment so it didn't matter. But watch out for the Italian Cookie. If you have loose fillings or fake teeth you might be in need for some dental work, that is one tough cookie and should be soaked.  Overall it was a very good $30.00 Restaurant Week Choice.

Undecided between 4 and 5 stars.  Outside of California Thai and my favorite Thai place that closed this seems to be the closest to perfect Thai based on just one visit.  I had what they call Sweet Basil here and ordered 4 out of 5 for my heat level. 4 is seriously hot and I don't think most people will order 4 here but for me it was enjoyable. The sweet basil here is full bodied and packed with lots of flavor and has that just right sauce that this dish needs. They use white meat chicken that seemed hand sliced and not chopped but it was moist and developed with flavor. so that's fine. I liked the crisp fresh green beans in this dish. The portion was larger than I was excepting since Thai usually runs on the small side. But what made the dish pop really was the well made sauce. It was really great with the right amount of flavors but could have been more like California Thai with just a touch of more basil. The sauce was so good my husband took my rice and added to what was left on my plate and my serving plate and wiped them clean.  My husband had a similar dish called Sweet Basil Noodles with Beef. The beef was very tender in a similar sauce with a nice assortment of vegetables in tasty noodles.  I don't know if they usually give out complimentary dessert but we were given Fried Bananas that were a perfect sweet ending that seemed to have a cooling effect for us after this full flavored Spicy Thai.  Prices were very reasonable I think our bill for two full entrees (not lunch) and two beverages with tax came to $21.00.  I do note this is a very small NOT FANCY place with tables close together. They have their own parking lot so parking is easy.   Open 7 days lunch and dinner.  4.5 stars

After two visits I'm still undecided between 4 and 5 stars this place is a solid four stars at least. This is a very TINY place that isn't fancy and only has a few tables but also serves very above average Thai Food.  We tried the Chicken Pot Stickers. They were packed full of tasty seasoned moist Chicken and were fried crispy in clean tasting oil.  My husband had the Sweet Basil Duck and ordered it at a 4 level heat out of 5. The Moist Rich Duck was Roasted and then added into the flavorful Fiery Sauce and with Crunchy Colorful Vegetables. This dish was excellent and was a bargain at the (I think) $10.99 Price.  I ordered the Green Curry with Chicken also at a heat level of 4 out of 5. I received a very Velvety Well Balanced Aromatic Sauce also with crunchy fresh vegetables but with not bad but slightly dry chicken. It didn't come out as spicy as I wanted it because it was close to being mild but I thought it was still delicious and I would still order it again.   They surprised us with complimentary ice cream.   The Owner/Chef Personally Thanked Every Single Person for Coming In.  A really Good Place for Thai Food.... Shame it's not an area I normally can go to or I'd go more often.  A true 4.5

I normally would not hesitate to give a place two or one stars for very bad service problems since I was a certified restaurant trainer for some time.   The dark haired youthful looking line cook made up for all the problems we had and went beyond all jobs he had to do and was a saving grace and deserves to be recognized and made our visit worth going back for. I DO NOTE the waitress wasn't at any fault at all since she was clearly over loaded with responsibilities including seating people while she was over loaded.  To keep it as short as possible. We ordered, drinks that almost didn't come out Meals were run out  while after sitting under heat lamp by line cook one meal came out one undercooked so we had to run one back to kitchen, and the LINE COOK ran the meal to me. I am touched and I need to say in general the food in the end was very solid.  The dinner items seem to have a little more Wow factor but what we had was good and better than what you get at most places.  I hope they get space heaters for next winter because it was a chilly maybe 43 degrees in the dining room just like outside was on Sunday.

This is a really great place and a gem of the area for sure. I am undecided between 4 and five stars and need a second visit to decide. I don't think any other place in the valley is like this place and offers these kinds of over the top foods. They prepare a multitude of in house meats in the house instead of just serving Boar's Head Brand like many little places do so that right there bumps them to at least four stars just for that. I was told they couldn't find bagels in Arizona that they liked so they send in REAL NEW YORK BAGELS from NEW YORK. I am kicking myself for not bringing home a bagel now. Yes some of the sandwiches are higher priced than what some people are used to paying but it is quality ingredients with a lot of workmanship and a double portion so when you put that into consideration the price is very reasonable.  No matter what you order they present you with a little freebie plate of something of the day. We tried really good pickles.  I was thrilled to see a chopped salad on the menu with salami, corned beef and fresh roasted turkey. This salad FOR SURE was over the top with High end mixed greens not to mention the very long list of added ingredients. Such as, not just corn but roasted corn, eggplant, cauliflower, bell pepper, green beans, kasha, radishes, egg, feta cheese, and crispy bow ties as the croutons. The house made Russian Dressing was very good and flavorful and went well with it. For me this salad was a little too busy but still very good and still seemed much lighter than one of those big old bad boy sandwiches. If I could tweak it I would use a different kasha such as roasted buckwheat because the kasha they used was more like a porridge and that was the only thing I'd change with the not important preference of less ingredients. ($14)  My husband tried the In house Roast Brisket, Pastrami, Corned Beef, Swiss on Rye. It's a giant sandwich and can feed two people. They give you a side of very good potato salad. The potato salad wasn't drippy at all and was made just right. The meats were made just right and this really is like what real sandwich shops were like on the East Cost but they slice the meat thinner here. ($16)  The only thing I really can criticize is our server was very sweet but not trained well. She didn't know the menu well but in time she will.  4.5 stars Mazel Tov Abe's You did very Good.  6-3-13 slight update  Went back over the weekend. We had Rueben sliders and a sandwich. All was still good. Took home a bagel and belly lox. The bagel was still fresh a day later and the belly lox was really awesome.

My review is only on the food from just one visit and not on the abundant selection of over thirty craft brews they offer on tap. I also noticed a selection of wines on tap and a very nice large dog friendly patio.  I ordered what I think was called the avocado salad and it really was among one of the best salads I ever had anywhere. It was unique and interesting and something better than what I would have at home because I wouldn't take the time to smoke my own beets. The combination of creamy avocado, mild goat cheese and smoked beets with those tasty little just the right amount of toasted almonds was quite a sensation in my mouth. I will have to steal that one as it really was that good. The greens were very fresh and above average and the dark meat chicken option was tasty and cooked just right. I also enjoyed the supreme segments of grapefruit as they added so much brightness and freshness and really cut the richness in the salad. The salad had everything going on it was really good.  My husband had the matador sandwich, it was pink beef with onions, peppers, mushrooms, horseradish Havarti cheese and a pretzel roll with two dipping sauces and fries. I didn't taste it but I thought it looked good. My husband said it was good but would have liked the peppers cooked more and more of them.  I would like to try the beer sampling option next time.  I thought the meals were reasonably priced. If I remember correctly the total including tax was around $23.00.

This is a small Bistro with a patio in Old Town Scottsdale. The building is an older converted house so there are very few parking spaces so you have to park in the street. The interior is dark and sort of dark shabby chic with lots of candles and old mirrors. The menu is Modern American with international accents and prepared using French Techniques.  I drove across town to try this restaurant for the restaurant week menu that was three courses with an amuse bouche for $45.00 a person. When I was seated I didn't receive a restaurant week menu and there was no mention of restaurant week from my server so I had to ask about it. I thought that seemed weird to me and afterwards the server quickly handed out restaurant week menus that differed slightly from what was posted online. It turned out to be an even better menu that what was posted.  For restaurant week they gave us two amuse bouches, a generous glass of wine and three great courses.  The first amuse bouche was so tasty I could have eaten a bowl of them. They were little scoops of yummy corn bread with pickled mushroom and a fresno chili. It was like a little taste of Thanksgiving.  My first course was the malted rice with mushroom dashi. It was just delicious! I never had anything like that before.  My main course was the Scottish Salmon. The fish tasted and was prepared just as well as the salmon I had at Bouchon's in Napa Valley. It was perfect. The cauliflower and dill topping complimented the fish without over powering it and those horseradish pickles on the side might have been the most interesting pickles I ever tasted. They were delicious and I wish I could buy a jar of them.  For dessert the roasted apple pain perdu with melted camembert and cider caramel was a perfect balance of savory and sweet. It also was light in texture and oh so buttery. It was just delicious.  Service was superb.  It was a great dinner and worth driving across town for.

After only one visit so far.......  "GEM ALERT"  Possibly the very BEST CHEESE STEAK in the valley is served here.   Lets start with the roll.   IT'S MADE IN HOUSE! The roll is a little on the soft side and is chewy but does hold up to the generous amount of filling the sandwich contains. I would prefer it toasted but that is a preference. It's a respectable roll.  The sandwich is packed with the tastiest, tenderest melt in your mouth ribeye steak that I tasted in a sandwich in Arizona so far. It's a really delicious sandwich!  The fries were prepared hot and fresh but are the crinkle cut kind.   We shared the Mac-N-Cheese Bites because they sounded fun. Little triangles with a familiar cheesy tasting coating and inside seemed just like someone filled them with Kraft Blue Box Macaroni and Cheese.   This is a small restaurant that also serves beer and is family friendly. Children get to visit the treasure chest.  This is a casual small Wisconsin Themed Restaurant. You order at the counter, pick a table or booth and the food get ran to you.  Service was very helpful, friendly and efficient.  They made us feel welcomed dining there.  If you like cheese steaks and are in the area you're going to want to give this place a try!

I fear giving any buffet four stars because we all know that any buffet can differ by the hour with food drying up or pans staying empty for long periods of time and God only knows what else.  This place smells very fragrant when you walk in but I found it a little strange but ok. We were seated and we waited for someone to greet us and after a while the gentleman that sat us just tells us to go help ourselves at the buffet because it's a buffet.  Most of the food I tried was tasty. Nothing was too salty or too oily. All the chicken I tried was moist and tasty and even the fish was fresh enough so I could eat it.   Currently a grade "A" Maricopa inspection is posted.  The buffet line started with a savory donut that seemed fresh made and wasn't oily at all. Next came a few vegetable soups. I thought the rasam (tamarind based) one had much more flavor than the sambar but both soups were very light with vegetables. The rice dishes were made from long grain rice and were very fluffy. They had dum aloo (baby potato curry), channa palgk (spinach & chickpeas), Fresh plain naan bread, They offered 5 meat dishes and one egg dish and offered three desserts and some beverages.  I found that many of the vegetable dishes ran spicier than the meat dishes. Most tasted good to me. I didn't care for two dishes that I tried due to they were just too foreign to me and they might not really be bad but dhal tadka looked fun but lentil dumplings in yogurt I couldn't get down and the upma vegetarian dish looked like potatoes to me but it was porridge with vegetables that I also couldn't get down.  2 of the three desserts were interesting. The gulab jamun was like tiny donuts that were soaked in something fragrant and sweet and the halwa was a vegetable packed carrot pudding.  Compared to other buffets I've been this one is a smaller buffet but it seemed well taken care of on my visit and plates were cleared quickly.  It was almost like a trip to India but with much better traffic and it only cost $13.99 for the Sunday Buffet.

When we walked in Franco himself greeted us and asked us to pick our table and he surprised us with a very generous plate of thinly sliced prosciutto and cheese. We also received a bread basket with at least four kinds of fresh bread and very high quality olive oil. The menu is interesting and does differ from other Italian Restaurants I've been too but I also wasn't expecting the very long list of added specials to choose from.  We started with the Grilled Vegetable Plate that included a variety of vegetables with the most delicious mushrooms I've ever tasted.  Next we shared one of the house made pastas it was the Fettuccine Tartufo. It really was a WOW dish. The sauce of Black Truffles with some olives was addictive and I found myself sucking the insides of my mouth to keep tasting the sauce. It's not the kind of sauce I normally like but this one was light and not heavy for what it was. The pasta it's self was very thin and light but still had some body to it.  For dinner I had to choose the Halibut special since it is in season now. I was presented with a great plate of well executed food. The halibut was very moist and fresh and was on top of the most simple but most delicious tomatoes with basil I've tasted in a while and it had a little kick to it too. The plate also came with two vegetables and very dreamy layered creamy potatoes. Everything was seasoned so perfect I couldn't say it was too much of something or not enough of something else.   My husband had another one of the specials that was a Veal Scaloppini Dish with a well made sauce that contained cherry peppers.   We tried the Merenghata it a semifreddo between a crisp meringue. The center was cold and like whipped cream and ice cream and the meringue was like a crisp cloud. It seemed very light and was easy to eat.  SIMPLE, fresh well prepared food priced very reasonably.  Franco personally thanked us for coming.  You have to do valet parking because they don't have a parking lot. The valet cost $5.00 before tip. This place is small and busy so you need a reservation.

I think this place can be considered a hole in the wall kind of place since it is very tiny and the only beverage served here is water. It's open and bright but I still had a claustrophobic feeling the whole time here.   The menu is very limited and more limited than the picture of a menu posted a while back.  I tried the chicken shawarma plate that came with two sides and picked what they called spicy carrot salad and eggplant. The chicken was moist dark meat that differed from other shawarma I tasted because it was more almost nutty tasting and less of that tang taste that some shawarma has. The portion was monstrous as I ate a bunch my husband ate some and I took over 4 oz home. Maybe they just wanted to use up that batch and let it all go on me? I don't know? The eggplant was tasty and tasted like you fried onions with eggplant in a pan. The carrots were skillfully chopped into the tiniest cubes and seemed to taste a bit like coriander but weren't spicy but flavorful. I liked the spicy sauce that came with the plate it wasn't too spicy but was very flavorful and it was long and lingering and interesting.  Both of us were blown away with the beef kabob. It tasted better than we were expecting so it was a pleasant surprise. It tasted like the juiciest better tasting burger you can imagine. A thin nice sear and very moist lightly packed beef that was very good. My husband said if we ever go back he will try a hamburger from here. The kabob plate came with two sides and my husband picked fries and salad. The Fries were COLD AND SOGGY and might have been leftovers from the large take out order before us. The salad was finely diced tomatoes and cucumbers that they call Israeli Salad but according to Wikipedia Arabs also call this salad Arab Salad and Palestinians call this salad Palestinian Salad so it seems the Mid East is also fighting for bragging rights over this salad.  Our waiter offered us some pita bread with tehini. I have to say time froze and stopped  still for a second when we tasted the pita. It was that good, I don't know how you make a simple pita taste that good but it was. It was fresh warm very light but strong in texture. My husband isn't really crazy about any shawarma from anywhere but even he said the chicken on this pita was delicious.  I took home my left over chicken home and a few sauces and ordered a few felafel's to go. They are green inside and that is an indication of a better felafel that is made with fresh herbs instead of dry. The felafel's didn't have a big crunch but were moist inside and very fresh herby tasting.   Our waiter was very thoughtful and just kept trying to bring me more food.  Some big hits but the fries were a miss. It really was like traveling the world. Limited hours I think open Sunday-Thursday.

PAPRIKA has reopened with a NEW Menu, New Staff and New Decor and still under the same ownership. The New Menu is different and features some Uzbek Russian Style Foods. I prefer the new decor it's much more roomy with only 6 tables and the counter is gone.  We tried the fresh baked to order Lepeshka Bread. A short time after ordering the bread a Hot piping fresh bread comes out to us.   We shared a beef Calzone/Samsa. It was baked dough stuffed with tasty marinated beef and onions. They served it with a slightly spicy tomato sauce. This was very good.  I had the Chicken Kebob Plate. The Chicken was outstanding. Plump Juicy Flavorful Chicken with seasonings and tasty fresh dill and onions. A variety of  salads were on my plate and an enormous pile of very fluffy rice and maybe the best pita bread you can get anywhere.  My husband tried the Chicken Shawarma. The plate was set up the same way. I do have to be honest and tell you the Chicken Shawarma didn't seem like the chicken shawarma I had before here. It was very tasty but was on the dry side and wasn't nearly as good as the Chicken Kebob to me.  My old favorites from Paprika are gone but I think I can get them most of them next door at Mozart.   Now I get to try new things I never had before. After watching other people I noticed many people ordering the soups and adding a condiment to it. I will try that next time.  Something new and different.  Portions were very large and I took most of the bread and half the food home.  Service was very good.

I saw the really great reviews for this place in Yelp and decided I had to try this place. Honestly this might be the best budget Asian Buffet I've ever been to. Some of the items I've tried were far better and more delicious than what I can get at the four closest Chinese sit down Restaurants to where I live. I'm not saying this is the best Chinese food anywhere but I'm just saying most of what I tried was better than what I can get near me and most of what I took was very good. I note I DON'T KNOW if they were just having a good day or if they are like this all the time or not since I fear endorsing any budget Chinese Buffet.  This new Buffet has over 150 items and is DIRT CHEAP as they charge $7.99 for lunch and 9.99 for dinner Monday threw Thursday and the weekend 10.99. On their website they say crab legs are included on the weekend but during the week they charge you for optional crab legs $1.49 a 1/2 Lb. and $2.49 a Lb. Drinks are extra.  When we walked in the servers were VERY WELCOMING and friendly. The place  seemed clean and is cute and has a slightly different look.  Of course I couldn't try everything but I did take a variety of stuff. I note this is the very first budget Asian Buffet I've been to where the salmon was actually edible and not funky tasting and dried out. The salmon was moist fresh and tasty and was a shocker for me. The chicken and broccoli was actually delicious and so was the yummy Asian Eggplant dish. I would have loaded up my plate differently if I was aware these were so good. They had flounder on this buffet and it really was flounder and not some mystery fish. Nothing I tried was oily. Someone can actually cook here and make some good food.  Only a few things I tried I didn't care for such as their tempura dipped vegetables as it had too much flour in it. Also they had a large variety of sushi and most were passable but not all I thought. Not the greatest sushi but better than the packaged supermarket sushi. Desserts aren't so special but you can take fruit.   Why hasn't Yelp's Buffet Guy Rand been here yet?   This place seems like a winner!

Short Story  Very good Pig and Very Good Pickles. The plates are protein heavy , nearly perfect and you can easily eat Pig PIG and MORE pig in a comfortable casual setting. (Insert the Monty Python Spam song here but use Pig instead of the spam word.) With a daily changing menu.  Long Story  They have many interesting starter plates we picked the pickles and the cheese plate so we could have variety . The pickle plate was colorful and impressive. Each vegetable or fruit I tried all tasted different and was interesting. I thought the cheese plate was very good since it was made of better cheeses  , it also was a good sharing size.   We had a Pork Porterhouse that was perfect and came with well seasoned beans and we also had a trout dish that differed from the on-line menu example but was delicious and prepared masterfully . Both dishes were light with the vegetables. The only real starch on the trout plate was the breading from the shrimp.  Decided to try a dessert since most have pig in them so we went for a less piggy option and tried the pretzel bread pudding topped with the BEST IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD peanut butter ice-cream. A yummy blackberry complimented this dessert making it taste like a yummy peanut butter and jelly sandwich. This dessert was nearly perfect my only criticism is that the bread pudding was chewy and hard but it was so tasty I ate it anyway.  Our server was very well trained and knew the menu well.  The ladies room was clean and nice but the stall was extremely small with the door opening in instead of out so even if you are tiny it's hard to get out.  Very solid very good.

Just like last year this is Maybe this is the Very best of PHX area Festivals with a vast assortment of local businesses  of many kinds and the awesome food vendors that were very generous with free samples and money off coupons to visit them. (Spinato's Pizza samples were really big and good and the St. Francis gave out big cups of delicious Pumpkin Soup) This festival was so organized in every way it was a pleasure. They had free parking in the garage ,many stations set up for hand washing, provided bottled water and they had places all over where you could sit . I enjoyed purchasing local produce from a vendor . They had activities for kids and vendors selling beautiful things from sunglasses-kitchen serving ware.The Festival was really a labor of love for the community.

THE VERY BEST MACARONS I HAVE EVER TASTED. They were MIND BLOWING CRAZY GOOD! Slap your Momma. Go to Church CRAZY GOOD!  Little bite sized wonders of not the ordinary flavors. I LOVED THE Savory Thai Curry Macarons, Tikka Masala macarons, and Rosemary and Cheve Macarons. I was told soon Whole Foods will carry them and I was told AJ's carries them. I have never tasted a French Macaron that was so transforming as these from Aunt Abby before!  Smoke a cigarette good even if you don't smoke good!  Really REALLY good!

OUTSTANDING OAXACA  IN PHOENIX!  The only problem is if you don't know your Memelitas from your Enmoladas ordering is bit difficult but not impossible.  We walked in and they have a menu board with pictures I really didn't know what I wanted because I didn't know what many of the plates were. So before I had that deer look in the head lights for too long I said I'd like something chicken with mole and the woman behind the counter said oh you want Mole Negro Con Arroz and pointed to a sign. I said, yes thank you that sounds good.  My husband said, "what would you recommend?" She told him about Memelitas and Enmoladas. I think they were similar but one was topped with a dark bean sauce and the other is topped with the dark mole.  For beverages they offer mostly Mexican Beverages and a few sodas but nothing is sugar free and there wasn't iced tea.  We seat ourselves and and soon bunches of things arrive. We received HOT Fresh Made Corn tortillas, a trio of salsas , chips and our two entrees.  The salsas were UNLIKE any other salsas I had anywhere else. We received a tasty tomatillo, a refreshing creamy avocado and the most interesting salsa was the Chili de Arbol (it's a Mexican bird's beak chili)  that also was the most spicy , smokey but not too smokey unlike your normal smokey sauce and it almost was creamy.  I received a very carefully cooked seasoned chicken leg that was falling off the bone moist.  But the skin was a throw away as is was moist and melting off.  The Mole sauce that blanketed the chicken was  the most well balanced mole sauce I ever had and that's why that sauce was delicious. A bit spicy, not too much chocolate, all the spices and ingredients carefully blended so you couldn't tell them apart.  My rice was fluffy moist and fresh, it tasted like it was cooked in house made chicken stock.  I'm not really sure if my husband received the Memelitas or the Enmoladas but what he received were shredded white meat chicken and cheese in folded corn tortillas that was topped with the same dark mole sauce. He said the chicken was moist and good.  They sell some Oaxaca Goods in the restaurant.  Very very good 4.5 Stars

Maybe not quite ready for prime time still with some opening hiccups but greatly improving and worth trying since this is the only Vietnamese for miles and miles. It seems Pho & Grill is now using the Angelina's name and the menu plates and some of the recipes changed.  We started with the steak wrapped around asparagus ($7.). This variation was tasty and good but didn't match description on menu. No spicy peanut sauce and no pickled salad. But it was good anyway. This variation was very unlike what I had when they were known as Pho and Grill.   I had a Grilled Chicken Salad. It was delicious the thigh meat was so tasty this really was an incredible salad for only $7.00 but like the appetizer it also didn't completely match description on the menu. For sure I didn't have an aioli garlic dressing or crushed peanuts. The dressing I had was very light and very fragrantly spiced and maybe better that what was described.  My husband tried the beef Pho  ($9. for large) with added meatballs ($2). He said it was good overall but wasn't crazy for the meatballs. Not the best Pho out there but it is the ONLY Pho you can get around here and it was OK.  Service was good this time.  It's a great big fat STRETCH to give this place four stars but four stars also means I am a fan so four stars it is. I don't feel right about the menu descriptions (or is it hiccups?)  but in the end the food tasted good and the service was fine.  Don't worry I'll let you know how it is next time. 3.5 stars

From what I tasted and saw on this last visit. I have to say Angelina's has really stepped it off on service and the Pho has greatly improved. I don't know if this was a good day or if they are this good all the time since I don't come often enough to know. They also post a current Grade A Maricopa certificate on the front door.  I got the Chicken Pho it was made with tender fresh white meat chicken. The broth tasted fresh made and was delicate with ginger and other flavors. I thought the broth had good flavors and I added the side plate of cilantro, Thai Basil, Jalapeños and lime. I didn't think I needed to add any sauces. At other places I have added sauces.  I ordered a large because it was only one dollar more than medium and I thought the medium might be too small but the large was way too much food for me. I don't know how much chicken they gave me but I couldn't eat it all. And I had enough noodles for four people I think. The very hot pho started to cook the chicken more and bring out the jalapeños to full strength. So you have to try to eat it as fast as you can because the chicken starts to dry out and the soup grows with too much spice.   My waiter was very sensitive and I almost offended him by leaving too many noodles in my dish. I insisted to him that it was very good and I was very full.  My husband had the rare beef and brisket pho. This time it was much richer with beef flavor than it was before and like the chicken pho it was very well seasoned. He said the rare beef also continues to cook but the brisket stays delicious and tender the whole time.  I do note they only gave us one small plate of the cilantro and other toppings to share but the waiter did offer to give us a second plate so you might have to ask for a second plate if there are two or more of you having pho.  It really was good I have to come here more often!

Excellent Fast/Casual Middle Eastern Style Food featuring a variety of unique Hummus and many interesting toppings.   It is a little confusing on how to order and is easier to understand when you read the website. The Main Menu is $6.45-$9.95.   Your best option for sampling the most amount of offerings is "the plate" so I went for that. I walked in front of the glass front buffet and the helpful people behind the glass served.   When you get "The Plate" They start with a really delicious Rice. You get TWO Protein Options. I went for the Flavorful Moist Brisket and the Lebanese Falafels. Since I got the brisket the Chef recommended a little Beef sauce over my rice and it was a really great suggestion. Then I got TWO vegetables Sides, yummy spicy carrots and crisp lemon broccoli. Next came Hummus and you either get one king or they split it and you get two. With all the flavors they offer I suggest getting two as I had the Beet root Hummus and the Original. You then get a salad choice and I picked Tabbouleh.  Believe it or not your not done yet.  Next are a large variety of pans of all kinds of vegetables and condiments and sauces and you pick whatever you like and get a pita too.  I picked Pickled Beets and some kind of Onion dish and really delicious Schug Sauce.  Now I'm at the end of the line and pay. Get my Cup for beverage and seat myself.  Everything was so delicious. I never had a Lebanese Style Falafel before and it seemed very different but also very good. The beef I tried was moist and flavorful and not too fatty. The rice was really, Really Good. I thought the carrots were super yummy. The pickled beets were almost crunchy with a really interesting flavor. Of course the Hummus was very good and that Schug Sauce was very aromatic and delicious. The shrug sauce had some kick to it but is a milder more herbal version of others I've tasted before but was certainly just as delicious.  Very Above Average Middle Eastern Style Food in a very casual and quick atmosphere.   4.5 Stars  P.S. No I wasn't able to finish my plate and took 1/2 home for latter.

Humble pie is a casual family restaurant that serves up Neapolitan style pizzas, salads, soups, sandwiches and other items. This is a small but local chain with at least a half dozen locations in the metro Phoenix area.   I have to admit I was fearful of trying this restaurant because of some of the negative reviews on Yelp but finally decided to give this restaurant a try because of the reasonable pricing and the dog friendly patio.  They offer a lunch express special. For $10.99 you can pick any soup or salad and any individual pizza so both of us went with those choices.  I started with the strawberry and gorgonzola salad. It was much nicer than I was expecting and it was made with the best tasting strawberries I tried all year. My husband had the minestrone soup and it was made with sausage that's made just for Humble Pie. My husband thought his soup was very good.  I had the margherita pizza. It looked like a gourmet pizza from any high end pizza joint. It was made with house made fresh mozzarella cheese and sprinkled with a generous amount of fresh basil. The sauce was good quality sauce. The crust was thin, light and crispy and either semolina or corn meal was applied to the bottom of the crust giving it a little extra flavor and texture. Lastly a sprinkling of oil was applied to the top.   My husband had a similar pizza but with the Humble Pie sausage.  Not the leading pizza in the valley but a very good pizza and it was a very inexpensive lunch special since it was two courses for $10.99.  Service was above average and was friendly and very considerate to my dogs. Our server brought the dogs water to drink.  It was much better than I was expecting.

Dam, I ate at the Beaver and it was very good! I liked it! I liked it! You just don't get Gravlax or Scandinavian Food anywhere except for cruise ships and Ikea but here you can get real fresh gravlax thats moist, rich and not too sweet and made just right, tasty with dill and a yummy mustard sauce with it. My super generous plate came with three sides and made with Hanna's own pickled beets that were sauced with rich sour cream. The cole slaw is very fresh, sliced nice and thin and seasoned with fresh dill. The tomato salad is very flavor packed with lots of fresh basil. The food was all flavorful and seasoned very nicely. I remember really liking the rosti from the old Tempe location but was disappointed with the rosti from this new Mesa location as it might have been purchased from Ikea as it had that McDonald's hash brown taste to it but I do note the Mashed potatoes and the dill potatoes looked Excellent and I was sorry I didn't order one of them instead of the rosti.  My husband tried the stuffed chicken breast. It was boneless and very moist. It was prepared very well. One of his side was the green bean salad and it was just like everybody's Mom's green bean salad made with those canned green beans.  The house made desserts do differ from the old Tempe location as the Beaver Balls and other baked desserts are gone and I remember they were very good.  We tried the Swedish Crepe with lingonberries. It was good I liked the not too sweet taste of the lingonberries and reminds me of my lingonberry shrubs from my old house that I planted. The crepe was good but the ice cream was too dense and too sweet for my taste.  You get a warm fuzzy feeling dining here as Hanna, her son and daughter are so friendly. They make you feel very welcomed.  This is one of the best family run businesses that you can go too! When you visit Ikea you should think about stopping here!

I pigged out at the Salty Sow's Sunday Brunch Buffet and I will do it again sometime!  I don't mean to boar you with details but this buffet wasn't typical of most buffets. Most buffets are just slop. The food here was a much higher quality and was VERY GOOD and not dried up or old. Everything was fresh and replaced quickly.  I squealed with delight when I tasted the crunchy, sticky, sweet and flavorful boneless fried chicken. There was so much food at the buffet nobody can eat everything.  Oh Lardy...There was Porchetta, Buttered Rainbow Trout Almandine, Fried Green Tomatoes in Guacamole, Beets with Goat Cheese, Brussels Spouts Caesar Salad, Cheese Grits, Hot Skillet Egg Dish, Jumbo Asparagus, Poached Eggs, Pork Chile Verde, Prime Rib Hash, Pastries and MORE! They will even make you an omelet if you request one.  The $5.00 build your own Bloody Mary bar isn't too shabby either with lots of hot sauces to add a variety of tomato juices, fun toppers like bacon and cheese stuffed olives and more.  They offer comfortable low top booths and mostly high top booths. They have a large dog friendly patio too.  At the time of this review the Sunday Brunch Buffet cost $18.95@ and is served 10-2 on Sundays.  It ain't no slop and feel free to eat like a swine.

Last week I saw the Grand Opening Banner so I wanted to try Ooka Hibachi out and I'm glad I did. This place is big and beautiful. But the sushi is what I will come back for. They have KILLER lunch deals here and it was hard to decide on what to try. We SHARED the three rolls with soup or salad for $11.00. Not only was it inexpensive and generous but this sushi had the very BEST rice to fish ratio that I had at any sushi place in this area. This was the most enjoyable sushi to eat because it wasn't too much rice and that is a big deal to me. The fish we had was very fresh as well. We tried the spicy yellow tail, spicy salmon and the spicy tuna. I do have to say they did lack spice and next time I will order the regular fish instead. We also shared the Yellow tail with Jalapeño appetizer. The fish was very fresh and the jalapeño wasn't too spicy for it . They seasoned the fish with ponzu sauce.  As we were leaving I noticed at the table next to us the couple had the Hibachi Lunch specials. They looked very good and most of them run around $10.00.  It was very inexpensive to dine here. Our appetizer two drinks salad and three rolls came to $25.64 before tip.  We had very good service.  This place is a gem in a big cluster of mostly chain places.

My first visit was good so we wanted to go back and try the Hibachi this time. We shared one steak and salmon combo hibachi. They started off with mushroom soup and a little salad. We ordered two simple rolls of salmon and yellow tail with scallions. We hoped that they would arrive before the hibachi but they arrived afterwards. So  maybe we didn't make it clear to our server that we wanted the rolls as a starter.  I thought the Hibachi was good it tasted the way I exspected it to taste with some fresh ginger and mild garlic and other Asian Flavors., We both thought the salmon was prepared better than the beef because the beef was slightly overcooked but still OK. It's a nice big plate of food so you really only need to order one combo for two people and maybe supplement it with some sushi. The vegetable fried rice was tasty and they give you sauces to use with the beef and salmon. The hibachi was very similar to others I've tried at other restaurants with them giving you a few shrimps for fun. We sat at a dining table and not at the hibachi table.   The salmon roll and the yellow tail scallion roll are OK and would be just OK at anyplace do to what they are. I was going to order the Angel Roll I think it was a combo of spicy tuna and regular tuna that they present in a heart shape. They do offer some different rolls I don't see all the time.  I still prefer this place to all the near by chain places by the movies here  and I also prefer place to the Asian Buffet across the street. The food is fresh and good tasting, the sushi is better than from the buffet and it cost less!   Service was a little slow but still OK.   They are open everyday at lunchtime or dinner.

I've already tried Szechuan Style Cuisine a number of times so I already had an idea of what to except but what I didn't except was the very friendly kind staff that made us feel very welcomed and seemed deeply concerned that we enjoyed our meal here. The food was similar to other Szechuan I tried but in general all seemed fresher, Brighter with more vegetables and not flame scorching hot. They also do Cantonese Cuisine but I didn't order any this time.  We started with the Bean Threads in Spicy Sour Sauce and the Spicy Cucumbers. The cucumbers were a less oily and less fiery version of what I had someplace else but they were fresher and brighter being crisp and fresh. They are kind of refreshing and additive and spicy but not too spicy garnished with fresh scallions hot chili's and Szechuan peppercorns that were slightly mouth numbing.   The bean threads come in a tasty sauce that is also hot but not too hot. The bean threads have a very soft texture but are very healthy with a low carbs and some fiber.  We had the Water Boiled Fish and it differed from the other times I had it. This one had more herb garnish, vegetables and was a very manageable heat level. It also had the freshest bean sprouts I've ever tasted in it and the fish was very tender and plentiful.  We also had the Spicy Pork with Pickled Vegetables. It was unlike any dish we had before and was very good.   We were checked on many times and our waitress even offered to give us more rice.  I drank the Chinese Black Iced Tea. It was presweetened and flavored. Not my kind but It reminded me of a long Island Iced Tea because I imagined a splash of cola in it. I don't know if it has cola flavor or not in it but that's what it tasted like to me. The owner very proudly told me that he imports the teas, herbs and many ingredients  from China for the most authentic experience he can provide.  A gem of Tempe.

After my first visit here I know that this place is an above average sushi place and I'm not sure if it might really be a five star place. This is the first place in the Glendale area that I've been to that uses REAL WASABI on the nigiri sushi and also seasons under the fish. A few things on the menu I'm not sure what they are but they also do a Korean Style sushi that is wrapped in lettuce.  When we stopped in we were greeted by the most enthusiastic happy person. We were taking a little time to decide and she gave us miso soup so I don't know if it comes with thee meal or not. We ordered a variety to share and ordered the two pick bento box some sushi and a specialty roll.  The Mackerel in the bento box really WOWED me. It was the most delicious mackerel I ever had. The fish was sweet and fresh and seasoned so tasty anybody would like it even if you hate fish you will like it. The salad was dressed with a creamy sesame dressing and the spicy tuna rolls were rolled just right and were fresh.   They don't have the biggest selection of rolls and many have cream cheese or are fried and that is why I didn't give five stars based on one visit. I tried the Salmon with garlic sauce roll. It was rolled very carefully and was a very good fish to rice ratio. The fish seemed very fresh and the sauce really made it taste good. I do note this roll had cream cheese in it and I might have missed seeing that on the menu.  This isn't a fancy place and is very small and opened in a previous sushi restaurant location using the same old sushi sign but this is a completely new restaurant in an older strip mall.  They also do reasonably priced all day happy hour rolls ($3 - $7)  Next time I might try the Korean Sushi and have some soju here!  4.5 Stars

I went back for a second visit and ordered some different things I never had before and was wowed again.  I never had Hoedeopbap before, it was described to me as Korean Sushi. It's basically Fresh Vegetables (sort of a salad) , Fresh Sashimi and a sweet and spicy sauce with seasoned rice. It was very good.  I did try a $3.00 salmon roll it was just OK and what you expect it to be.  I had what they called Screaming O Roll. I'm not sure why they call it a roll since it isn't but it's Tuna Tataki. The Tuna is marinated and seasoned and only slightly seared and wow it was really delicious.  From my last visit I highly recommend getting the Nigiri sushi since they put REAL WASABI on it and I also recommend getting a bento box with Mackeral because I never tasted mackerel that was that delicious before. The Bento box is better than I had from some other places because you can get a good roll instead of that CA roll and that really great mackerel.  We enjoyed a bottle of Soju it's the sweet potato kind that's considered the better kind and pairs perfect with the food.  This place is small and not fancy. The owner is the only one making the sushi all the time. For sure this is above average sushi in the Glendale area.  4.5 Stars

In a nut shell the main dishes were very good and some things didn't knock it out of the park for me but they just opened and might still be working things out so that should be noted. Even with the only SLIGHT misses I still think they are deserving of a four star rating.  I thought the roasted cauliflower with yellow curry was delicious. The sauce was mild so you could still taste the vegetable and currants and better almonds in it. Cafe Bink used to make a curried chicken salad that tasted very similar that I enjoyed.  The marinated Leek dish was the most attractive dish we tried but for my taste it was missing something since it was so delicate with little flavor. I looked for salt and pepper but the tables don't have any on them so I went without. They weren't awful just lacking with flavor for me.  The Deep Fried Baby Back rib came out a bit dry and chewy. I didn't taste the sauce but my husband said it lacked heat and for him was overly sweet.  I had what they called a Sand Dap Po Boy Sandwich. I'm not sure if it really is the definition of a Po Boy but it was a very tasty sandwich that you can't get anywhere else that I know of. I ordered the single piece of fish but for $3 more you can have two pieces of fish in your sandwich. It was a smaller sandwich that wasn't too heavy. The pickle was not your average pickle and was dimensional with flavors. The salad was fresh and good and dressed perfect.  My husband had the Cider Braised Pork on Onion Bun, This was a bigger sandwich than the Po Boy. This was another very good sandwich. The pork was tender and seasoned very well the onion bun was fresh and tasty. Apple added nice crunch to the sandwich. I recommend that if you order this sandwich to get the mustard on the side so you can appreciate how well made it was with interesting flavors that linger. They should sell this mustard it 's very good.  We tried the Cake Donut and the Butternut Squash Pop. The Donut was good but I wasn't a fan of the butterscotch sauce only because for my taste it was over caramelized and had a caramel taste instead of a butterscotch taste. The Butternut Squash pop was the better one for me. But It seemed to be missing Chocolate that I read in the description. (see my photo no chocolate) I could taste the tamarind it was different but overall good with layers of different flavors.  I liked all the White Stripes Music they played while we were here but it might not be appealing to some people.   They have fresh herbs growing in the bathroom. I hope I don't eat bathroom herbs when I come back. I think that might be the biggest miss for me.  I didn't try the soda but my husband said it wasn't so good here. I had Iced tea and it was OK.  The atmosphere is light and airy and they have lots of patio room.  You have to use the valet here no charge for the valet but you tip him.  The sandwiches from here were very good and all those sides made it fun and interesting.

Our main plates were masterfully crafted and delicious and well worth what we paid and deserving of five stars but this is how it went.  We shared one of the many small seasonal vegetable plates to share. The Asian inspired Marinated Eggplant with serrano chili , peanuts and enoki mushrooms was pretty good but was an extremely small portion for $7.00. I am guessing the piece we shared was two and half inches long and approx. an inch and a half wide. Not a big deal but I think it should be mentioned.  My waiter didn't completely describe the pig of the week sandwich and left out the Greek Yogurt Sauce in his description and neglected to give my husband his choice of side. We didn't say anything about receiving chips instead of a salad or fries but my husband had to say something about the yogurt sauce since he HATES yogurt and doesn't eat it and pulled the top bun off the sandwich since it had a big spread of yogurt on it. Our waiter did check on us and offered to bring my husband another dish but neglected to bring my husband a yogurt free bun top. With all that being said Everything else about the plate was excellent down to even the house made pickle.  My salad was amazing, the kind of salad that makes you hear angels sing. The horseradish honey vinaigrette dressing had the perfect layers of sweet , heat and deliciousness. My arugula salad had fresh figs, sweet and spicy pecans, chewy apricots and slightly crisp spaghetti squash it was so interesting. At first I thought it was very fine crunchy cabbage but it was spaghetti squash. All the different tastes and textures were very good. It's optional to add protein to your salad and since I can eat chicken or steak anytime I went for the sand dabs. They were very charred but not burnt. I think the char was intentional because it tasted good that way. This certainly was an over the top very good salad.  It's not my intention to end this on a sour note but our waiter brings us dessert menus and accidentally gives us two different menus. The waiter returns and we asked what menu do we order from and he didn't know and returns with the answer so we went with what was called White Chocolate Strawberry Short Cake. What we received were tart marinated strawberries topped with some crumbs and a BIG side of lemony white chocolate cream. I wouldn't get this dessert again as it wasn't naughty or tasty to me like what I want in dessert. I'm not really sure if it really should have even been called a strawberry short cake since it didn't have any cake only crumbs on the top. It was sort of weight watchers if you held back on eating all that cream. I think it was like an unfrozen parfait in a dish. I do note I have had very good desserts from Bink Restaurants just this last one didn't do it for me but it might for someone else.  Overall a four star rating because of so so service some dishes are well crafted big hits but a few  misses.

I was undecided about the full FIVE Stars only because of an allergy request that was ignored but when you have a dish that was THE BEST OF YOUR LIFE service issues go out the window.  This is an upscale casual dining restaurant. The owner of this restaurant has been James Beard Nominated many years in a row. The menu changes often with the seasons and many interesting small plates featuring local produce are always served on the menu. You have to use the valet service to park. It's free but then you have to tip.  We came for restaurant week and got a fabulous three course meals for thirty three dollars each.  I started with the local tomato gazpacho. It was very non-traditional in texture. It was very airy and light and silky smooth. The soup had a very concentrated cucumber taste in it.   My entree was the Korean Style Fried Chicken. It truly was THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. It was spicy, sweet, vinegary, not greasy, crispy crackly perfect with a juicy flavorful interior. Absolutely DELICIOUS! It was life changing and sets the bar for fried chicken for me. It came with a small amount of sweet pickles with kimchi coleslaw that was maybe Thai HOT spicy.  For dessert I had the sour cherry clafoutis. It was a richer texture than other clafoutis I had before but the many flavors were very spot on. This was a delicious dessert that was worth eating. Most desserts out are not worth eating to me. The dark chocolate brownie was also outstanding.  Back to the service issue. Our actual server was friendly and efficient but I made my reservation with a specific request for buckwheat not to be served for one person. For some reason I don't know why buckwheat bread was ran to our table not once, not twice BUT THREE times during our stay.   The Korean Style Fried chicken was so amazing I can't give four stars.  If I could I would give a 4.5 stars because of the service issue.

This is a nice Italian Restaurant located across the street from the Biltmore Shopping Center in the Esplanade. You have to park in the parking garage but it's free because the restaurant validates the ticket.   You see lots of paintings for sale filling the walls.   Our waiters were very friendly and gave us outstanding service and they dress extremely  casually. To be honest I thought the dishwasher was waiting on me until he took our order.  We were here for restaurant week so my experience may differ slightly.  Our appetizers were sausage and a full size mushroom, balsamic and arugula pizza. Both were tasty and very large portions.   We shared a mushroom pasta course. The pasta was toothy and the mushroom were cooked well and tasted like they were kissed with wine.  My dinner was the ribeye. It was seasoned nicely and cooked to a perfect medium rare. It came with beans that seemed fresh cooked. The beans were cooked nicely but seemed almost unseasoned.  My husband had a pasta dish with shrimp and Calabrian Chili. Pasta was toothy, shrimp cooked well and this dish was SPICY. Like Thai Food Spicy!  For dessert we shared the cheese course and the lava cake. While it wasn't the best cheese course I've had.....It wasn't bad either. I thought it was nice to offer something for people who don't like sweets. The lava cake was tasty but needed to be served slightly hotter because the filling didn't run.  3.5 stars rounded up for exceptional service!

This is a small semi/fast casual free standing taco & tapas shop in the middle of a busy parking lot. They have OUTDOOR DINING ONLY. You order either threw the drive threw or the walk up window.   Some things were better than other things.  We shared a variety of things.  The chicken empanada was tasty and out of the tacos I tried I liked the vegetable one best because it had the most flavors and textures. I didn't try the shrimp taco but my husband liked that one the best.  The chicken and steak tacos were kind of meh and had little flavor.  The fish taco was awful and tasted fishy. They need to remove that one from the menu.  The side order of beans was just like beans in water. I don't know if this is the way they normally make it but if it is they need a new recipe for beans. I do note that the place had only kids working there on our visit. I don't know if it's that way all the time.  Service wasn't the best. We ordered a side of guacamole that was ignored and when we got our sack of food it was missing utensils and napkins. My husband had to go back and wait in line to get forks.  I would still recommend going here instead of something like a taco bell but just be prepared that this isn't the best.

I'm usually slightly disappointed at most Fox Concept Restaurants but what I experienced at Little Cleo's was different. First of all... Little Cleo's is surrounded by other Fox Restaurants in a Large Area Called The Yard that's very crowded with lots of people. You have to Valet Park and it's almost like walking into a small city. Then when you walk into Little Cleo's you get transported back in time. It's like from any OLD CITY. Little Cleo's has a Genuine 1940's Look down to their vintage looking glassware.  We sat and decided to have a cocktail and both had Sazeracs. I have to say they were very good.  We decided to go with the restaurant week menu that features items of the regular menu but at reduced price including a glass of Sparking Wine.  Our server Brian was very helpful explaining the menu to us and was also very attune to the allergies I listed on my reservation. All threw our meal he really was a phenomenal server.  We started with the Crispy (Asian Inspired) Frogs Legs and the Sturgeon Bacon Toast. According to my husband those Frogs Legs are amazing. He kept trying to get me to eat them but I have thoughts of that frog from chemistry class and I can't get frog in my mouth. My husband kept taking all weekend about how delicious those Frogs Legs were and wants to go back just for the Frogs Legs. The Sturgeon Bacon Toast was delicious. I tasted it before at Devoured so I knew what to expect but this was a much larger version that I also shared with my husband. I think most people would like this toast.  We both had the Grilled Loup De Mer. Our Fish was cooked perfect and had a Delicious Wood Fired Char taste to it. The sauce complimented the fish and didn't over power so you could taste everything. A small portion of  Artichoke Buttons with Shallots garnished the fish.  Both deserts were worth the calories. The Beignets were hot and made fresh for us and came with a tasty Whiskey Caramel Sauce. The Buttermilk Pie was creamy and rich and laced with a lemon flavor that went very well with the blueberry topping. Real just made Whipped Cream topped the pie.  This was very close to being a five star review. I was five star satisfied but in the end for me in my opinion the Fish entree should have come with a complete side dish. We both had enough food and I know they do sell vegetable side dishes but most restaurants that I have been to do give you at least one complete side dish with a fish entree.  Little Cleo's if you like Seafood you might get hooked!

Thai Lotus offers a GREAT BIG Menu with LOTS of to choose from and they are open SEVEN DAYS a week for lunch and dinner. Also did I say they offer PUMPKIN? Two pumpkin dishes the day I was there.  My husband tried the Spicy Basil Duck, it was prepared reasonably well. For my taste it could have used more basil but was good.   I decided to try one of the specials it was Spicy PUMPKIN Basil, Cashew, Egg, and Vegetables with Chicken. You pick mild medium or hot and I picked hot and it was just right for me I'd say 6-7 out of 10 for spicy heat. The chicken in the dish was cooked reasonably well. Egg was cooked in the sauce instead of being fried on top. In this dish the pumpkin was cooked well and the dish had a nice variety of vegetables in it in a tasty sauce with the typical flavors.  The road to Thai Lotus looks closed but it isn't and you can get threw or you can pass the intersection and pull into Tacos Atoyac and you will find parking for Thai Lotus as you pull threw.  3.75 stars rounded up for the service and really great menu.

This buffet just opened Friday in the spot were Hibachi Grill used to be and it looks the same with the really funny resteroom sign that I tried to photo but couldn't. Sadly I left hungry with an upset stomach over the foods I tried. I started with some sushi that sort of looked dried out and when I tried a piece the rice wasn't seasoned and was just gooey and fell apart.I was hoping for some tasty seafood since this is a seafood buffet. I"m not sure I did SEE FOOD but I saw cod and what they called salmon that was a white flesh fish here. I really like fish and I wasn't able to eat either of them the taste was too offensive. I put some vegetables on my plate but the broccoli was mushy and had a strange taste to it.   Since I still didn't eat almost anything I decided to try the Mongolian stir fry. I picked some vegetables that looked good and some chicken. The stir fry guy asked me if I wanted teriyaki or soy sauce so I picked soy sauce. He chopped, he slopped sauced it up a bit and he twirled the spatula around a bit for show. It looked OK to me but it tasted awful like an 8 year old made it. The chicken was extremely dry I couldn't eat it but the way it tasted was just awful like all just soy sauce.   They had one salad that wasn't completely awful but it tasted like old fish, it was the seaweed with cucumbers and radish. I was able to pull out the radishes and eat the radishes but the rest tasted very fishy.  The chicken on a stick was sweet and weird tasting. (YUK)  My husband tried to eat an octopus and he said it was just like rubber.  They didn't have much in the way of prepared stir fry dishes.  I tried a piece of battered chicken that was OK and a couple of cold french fried that were edible.  I did like the bean paste stuffed bun that looked like a peach.   The fresh grapes were very good.  I saw loquats so I took some. I popped one in my mouth and had to spit it out because it tasted like something meaty was on it.   They just opened maybe they will get better and just don't have it together yet?  I also note I didn't try everything so MAYBE they had some good dishes? I didn't try? However I will never return.  As only a slight update This Buffet was featured on 5-16-13 on Dirty Dining with 11 major health code violations. (no wonder why stuff just didn't taste right) So you should check the Maricopa Co. Health Inspections before you dine here.  ANOTHER slight update Aug-22-13  6 major health code violations according to Dirty Dining on KPHO

A casual energetic urban center with a MOSTLY health focused menu unless you notice all the baked goods. They do slow wood roasted meats on a rotisserie. You order at the counter get handed a number find your seat and they run your order out to you unless you just go for the grab and go section. Also a small amount of mostly local goods including books and nick knacks and some grains.  I tried a salad called Public Market Vegetables. It was a mix of marinated, steamed and raw vegetables and went for the add on chicken up charge. It was a very fresh tasting salad with a stunning mix of vegetables of different textures. Carrot ribbons and spiral crisp carrot spaghetti, sprouts, fresh dill, spinach leaves and marinated cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetables. The white meat chicken seemed poached and was very fresh. For me this salad had too much acid in the dressing or maybe just combined with the marinated vegetables for me but I still thought it was a very above average salad.  My husband loved the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie. The pork was tender with a really perfect spice level and all that tasty sauce just melted into the crust like butter.  They have all kinds of seating here. Sofas tables with chairs and bench tables.  The restrooms are unisex.  Your silverware is in a bin on your table and you have to hope little kids didn't play with your utensils before you used them.

This is a very small and NOT FANCY but clean Caribbean Bistro with only Five Tables. You order at the counter and seat yourself and YOU WAIT a half hour or more for your food.   I have to say the food was worth the wait.  I had the Red Snapper Whole Fish Stew. It was delicious anybody would enjoy it. The fish was fresh and prepared perfect in a tasty tomato broth loaded with lots of fresh crunchy vegetables. The dish came with tasty plantains, a salad garnish and enough rice studded with just cooked beans to feed a family.  My husband had the Jerk Chicken. It was powerful with spice and heat and isn't a dish for the timid. The chicken in it was very fresh tasting and very tender and the plate had a similar set up to mine.  The people working there seemed very friendly and asked us often how everything was.  I do need to note I'm not certain if they have a public restroom. I only saw one door in the dining room that led to the kitchen with a sign that reads Do Not Enter. I did notice a hand sanitizing station by where you leave your used plates.  The place is clean, I noticed a Grade "A" Maricopa Health Inspection.  The Prices are very low.  This is a place that's worth checking out!

A gem of Glendale is here!  This is a very small and NOT Fancy but clean Caribbean Bistro with only 5 tables and no restroom. You order at the counter, seat yourself and wait a CARIBBEAN MINUTE for your food. That means 20-40 minutes depending on what you order.   All the food we tried was delicious!  Last time I had the snapper and it was fresh and so delicious. This time I had the Chicken Curry. It was flavorful and stewed to perfection and was just falling off the bone tender. I was offered hot sauce and it appeared to be home made and was MIGHTY HOT! My platter came with a large amount of rice that was studded with beans that went well with the melty tender chicken curry. I also had some fresh braised cabbage and fried plantains.  My husband wanted to order the oxtails but they weren't ready yet so he went with the Jerk Chicken. I tasted a piece of it and thought it was spicy, delicious and also was very moist. I liked all the flavors in it.   The people there were very nice and friendly. They checked on us often and offered us some extra fried plantains.  A specialty of the house is cow foot's soup. They also offer goat dishes too.  This little place from the desert brings the Caribbean to you!

Based on what I had this place is a HIDDEN GEM!  This place used to be an OLD COUNTRY STORE and was converted into a restaurant sometime in 2013. You enter an old historic wild west looking building that isn't fancy. For dinner they offer a burger menu and the regular menu with sandwiches and dinners. They also have a bar with tables. They have cocktails and beers and offer only house wine.  For dinner we started with the sweet corn nuggets. They were on happy hour special and were two dollars off. ($4.25) The nuggets were sweet and tasty and the dipping sauce was nicely spiced.  My dinner was the peach topped halibut special. ($17.00) My halibut had a yummy grill taste to it and was prepared next to perfect! The dish came with tasty barley risotto and fresh charred asparagus. This dish was a bargain because I've paid $30 a bunch of times for halibut dinners in Scottsdale that weren't as good.  My husband had the country fried steak. ($13.75) His steak came with a fresh dinner salad and two sides. He said the country sauce over the steak was unusually good and the steak was tasty. The fresh grilled vegetables were a very generous portion. The mac-n-cheese was marginal but we are very picky about mac-n-cheese and would get a different side next time.  This is a place I wish I discovered sooner because what we had was good!  Hidden Gem for this area!   Great place to bring out of town folk or kids to because of the wild west atmosphere and reasonable prices.

JD Campbell's formally called LW's Hide-A-Way used to be an Old Country Store and was converted into a restaurant back in 2013. The atmosphere is Wild West with wood and trophies. The grub isn't fancy but they have been known to serve up some killer specials that were priced right and they are well known for a special burger menu.  It kills me to lower my rating for this restaurant since I enjoyed some killer specials here.   I note that I am not lowering the stars after one not so good visit and am lowering the stars after a couple not so good visits. On my last visit I tried a special that tasted awful. I just figured they screwed that one up.  My last dinner here was the Blackened Salmon. I've had this dinner on the menu before. Last time I had the same dinner the fish had a great texture, could have passed for fresh, tasted great and the sides were prepared nicely.  This time when I had it I can tell a different story. The fish had a crumbly weird texture and didn't have the same taste. Last time the vegetables were pretty good but this time if you take the time to look at my current photo you can see the vegetables might have came out of the microwave without seasoning or anything. Nobody likes zucchini just warmed up from the microwave. The macaroni and cheese really was awful. It was so overcooked it was gooey pasta. The sauce tasted like blue box thined down with a smokey bbq sauce that was added or possibly just fell into the pot.   The food was so bad I almost started to cry.  I asked if they have a different cook and was told nothing has changed. (???????????)  I didn't give one star because my husband wants to try them again since we had many nice meals here.  You might do best ordering breakfast or a sandwich here.

My review might be slightly more helpful because I wasn't here on a Wednesday Night for the phenomenal Wednesday Special like almost everybody else was here for.  The menu is very limited and for the most part you are going to order a pizza or a burger and drink wine or one of the many craft brews they feature.  I can't say we had the best burgers out there anywhere because I haven't been everywhere but I can say we had some doozies of very good burgers priced less than Vegas and better than what we had in Las Vegas at one of those specialty burger places.   Ivan Burger $12.00 Hangover Burger $14.00 Most craft brews run an average $8.00 VS. Las Vegas close to $20.00 a Burger  They only have a couple burgers to pick from on the menu and they can be altered slightly. I went with the famous Ivan burger. It is extremely large and is a half pound burger patty with the usual lettuce,tomato,onion, choice of cheese chipotle Mayo on a pretzel bun. It comes with tasty battered fries. My burger was cooked a perfect medium just like I asked for and had a nice crust. It was a very juicy burger but not too much as it didn't fall apart. The pretzel bun was strong enough to support all the weight of the sandwich fillings. It really was a tasty burger.   I think at least half the people out there might think like me and admit the burger is too large. I split the burger in half because I knew that would be plenty. But would have enjoyed it more if it was smaller so it would be easier to manage. For me it was very thick and still delicious but too thick.  My husband tried the Hangover Burger. It's basically an Ivan Burger but with an added egg and he said really good bacon. I don't know how he ate that whole sandwich but he did and said he had to because it was really good.  The Attic is located above a sandwich shop and uses the name Cave and Ives on the outside of the building and on the receipts. The steps are easy to climb but if you are handicapped an elevator is available.  The burgers we had were VERY GOOD! The Pizzas looked good! Lots of craft beers.

If you have dined at other fine Restaurants you know Virtu is certainly up with them. Virtu is a small, not the fanciest but cozy restaurant with an Old Fashioned Feel I say this because of the bar area it just looks like from another time and after dining there I know everything thing is well crafted like things used to be in the old days. I am usually a wine drinker with a fine dinner but the cocktail menu is made up of unusually well crafted with Cocktails that are made with very upscale ingredients put together for you that a mixologist creates for you in a meticulous way. The drinks are very well worth the I think it was $10-$12 but they aren't just poured in a glass and take almost as long as a food order to prepare but  they really are worth the wait!  From my experience the waitstaff seems to be very well trained and even the hostess is able to answer any question about the menu.  We started with the House Made Testa. I didn't know what Testa was so I had to ask. It's a Mix of the finest Italian Meats and head cheese sort of like a pate with Cornichon Calabrian Chili Relish and Truffle Grain mustard with some micro greens for texture. ($11)  We also had a Winter Vegetable Salad. It was Mache greens. It had a lot of attention to detail as the small cubes of squash were seasoned and had a texture that added interest to the salad. The Ice Wine Vinaigrette was unusual. ($12)  I had the Pan Seared Branzino with Sunchoke Puree and Truffled salsify crisps with Sundried Tomato Pesto. This for sure was a solid five star dinner. I've had very good branzino at other places in the valley and I also had outstanding seafood dishes in others places like Las Vegas and I can truly say this was the best Branzino dish I ever had. First of all the fish was pristine fresh and fish just taste different when it is that fresh. It was prepared absolutely perfect and the textures and all the different sauces and vegetables just went together like magic. The Crisp salsify added a very unique taste. It was all so delicate and interesting. It was a dish that couldn't bore you and just got more interesting as you dug threw it. ($28)  My husband had the Hand Made Spaghetti Pork Osso Buco. It was topped with Ricotta and Parmigiana Reggiano and Fried Basil. My husband said it was Outstanding and that's the kind of dish he likes and eats that kind of dish often when we go out to nice places. ($19)  It was very hard to decide on dessert since they all sounded very interesting but we went with the Nutella Chèvre Cheese Cake with a Pretzel Crust. It was very perfect with flavors and wasn't too sweet with a not too heavy creamy texture. I liked the special candied hazelnut that came with it. ($12)  There is a reason Virtu was voted one of the "Best New Restaurants in America" by Esquire Magazine, it's because they are.

I go out to eat often and had salads from many very good places. I've been here twice so far and both times the salads were excellent and above average. The steak salad was made with delicious crusted filet mignon that was more delicious than many dinners out I've had. I was very impressed with the ahi tuna salad as it was very fresh and nicely crusted. Since then I had a salmon salad that was also very good.   The second time we were here my husband ordered the chicken panini. He received a very delicious fresh chicken sandwich. The inside was toasted but not the outside like what I think of like a panini.  Or it just didn't make it to the panini press. I don't know.  He just ate it and said it was a delicious sandwich he liked the fresh juicy chicken , the roasted pepper and the cheese. I note they were training a new girl that day and I don't know if they make this sandwich this way all the time or not.  I do note I deleted my original review because for a short time someone changed the Name and address of this place and I didn't want to have a false review on Yelp. After all that's not logical but it is logical to order a salad from here!

I go out to eat often and have been to many places. I can tell you the food from here has been consistent and very well prepared. The proteins I tried from various visits were very above average and many were better than from expensive dinners I had from other places.   After not ordering the Ahi Tuna salad in a long time from I ordered it again fearing it wouldn't be as good as before but actually it was improved and even better! As before the generous amount of Ahi Tuna was just as delicious and just as fresh tasting with a tasty crust. The salad was fresh cut and I liked the fresh cut oranges in it and instead of a crusted toast I got this tasty toasted flat bread that was delicious. The whole salad was delicious and was great!   My husband got the Chicken Fried Steak. "He said it was really good and why don't we come here more often?"  Prices are reasonable.   This is a small casual Breakfast/Lunch only place in the smaller shopping center across the street from Desert Ridge Mall.  4.5 Stars

We were excited to try this new restaurant. Tried the chicken pot pie nuggets, they had a nice thin crisp but the insides were half empty so they were a meh.  The Inside out French Onion Grilled Cheese Cheese Sandwich was tasty and the Onion soup laced with wine was good.  The slow cooked egg on the jumbo asparagus seemed undercooked and slightly raw. The whites were slightly undercooked and runny. The yolk was not velvety as I am sure the chef intended. The asparagus were nice fresh and crisp but I didn't enjoy the undercooked egg on it, as it was just asparagus in a pool of liquid that didn't coat the asparagus. I've eaten slow cooked eggs before and missed that velvety consistency.   The VERY BEST OUTSTANDING thing I tried were the fish tacos. They were so delicious and layered with flavors and spices on clever thin crisp taro root shells. But the problem was they were so tiny, more tiny than street tacos maybe only a little over an inch long. But they were $4.00 each so you spend $12.00 for Super Great Tacos that are only slightly larger than amuse bouche sized. The tacos we received were just too small for $12.00 so I feel that is a meh.  Cheese plate was OK but uninspired. Some of the grapes had rotten spots. While not fully rotten they were too far from fresh to be on the plate.  A little concern and observation from the kitchen should have caught this.  We brought the grape issue to someone's attention in a nice way asking for nothing in return, and were told someone would come out to speak with us. We waited and waited then got the check and then paid the check. Nobody ever came out.  I would have given three stars but since nobody came out to speak to us. Price point is a factor too.  Wine selection by the glass is limited $14. - $25. a glass   Cocktails that I looked at ran $14.00 - $17.00 a glass

George and Sons recently opened in the Deer Valley Towne Center. What makes George and Sons different from other Chinese Restaurants in the area is George and his staff. He is a Showman and Master with communication and Service. He was very particular on the way we were served. He checked on the favors and spice of our dishes and said if you want something more or less spicy tell me and I will change it. If you want anything different from what I did you tell me and I will do that. You can't ask for much more than that. They offer mostly Chinese Dishes but do offer other Asian such as Thai.  The atmosphere is more upscale than other Chinese Places in this area with a Zen like Fountain and attractive modern decor. They feature a full bar but it looks like this location doesn't have a buffet. Also there is no mention of this location on their website.  We ordered one lunch plate and one regular entree. They started us both out with small regular salads tossed with a very thin white dressing.  I soon received my Spicy Thai Basil Chicken. Upon receiving it I thought it was lacking basil but when I tasted the chicken I found it was infused with the right amount of basil flavor so it was good and the chicken was moist. The spice level was good and not too much but also not too little.  This lunch plate came with generous scoops of steamed rice and a scoop of very tasty lo mein noodles not to mention a crab puff and also a vegetable spring roll.   My husband tried the Spicy Beef. It was beef in a Szechuan Sauce with a few vegetables. I thought the beef was good and tender. For me the sauce ran a little salty but was OK.  3.5 Stars Rounded up for very good Service and a very nice addition to the area.

Short Story-  Either the best or one of the BEST at Thai Cuisine in the Metro Phoenix area. (Spice level runs one-two hotter than other places)  Service can be HIT or Miss and on my day it was a Miss or I might have gave 5 stars. (on my day service didn't get bad till we wanted to leave so it was mostly good)  Longer Story-  We came at a popular time when the place started to fill up quickly. Our server seemed rushed and quickly took our order and dashed away before we were able to order beverages but she did bring us water so we went with that. (no big deal that is typical and average service when a server is too busy)  We did notice they only had one waitress on with another that seemed like a helper. The place filled up quickly and the two ladies were working like a team together.  We started with these  green leaves stuffed with the most insanely DELICIOUS mixture of toasted coconut, pieces of lime, ginger, and peanuts. Small pieces of a very hot chili was on the side and when you add just one it's the perfect heat. You taste sweet, spicy savory, tart and tangy and all the textures. It just delicious! It's a MUST GET DISH!  I soon receive my Pad Ped Makeur (Eggplant) with Chicken. I ordered it one level under Thai Hot and WOW was it hot! I almost couldn't eat it. But WOW was it delicious! The Chicken was prepared very well and this dish was layered with the just right flavors that made it just right.   My husband had the Kapow with Beef Thai Style. They hand chopped the beef giving it more surface space to taste the sauce more. The beef seemed like a better quality than what you'd usually get at a typical Thai Place. What made the dish special was that PERFECT Crispy Fried Egg with a runny center. This Kapow was very good. (I do note the dish should have had the same amount of basil as the Eggplant Dish had and was slightly short on basil)  We eventually finish the scrumptious food and we wait about 20 minutes for our server to stop by and she said she'd bring the bill.  And we wait and wait and wait and wait and wait.  We decided she was just too busy to ever come back so we HAD to leave money on the table.  I don't know if they were short on help or if they often roll like this?  Food 5 stars or close to 5 stars.  I only deducted one star because service was mostly good  (average) and the food was delicious and was above average Thai.

Donut Shops are on the rise in the Metro Phoenix Area and Desert Donuts is certainly unique. The Donuts are made fresh to order. At the time of this review the sweet fresh donuts are priced at $1.50 each and you get a fresh cooked to order vanilla cake donut that you can have with a variety of toppings and or fillings. They also offer breakfast donuts topped with eggs and bacon.  I looked at all the choices and went blank so I got one I saw on the menu, the Boston cream. My donut was hot and fresh. It was a light cake batter that wasn't too sweet and the toppings were tasty.  Maybe as this Donut Shop gets more popular they can offer a couple more flavors of donuts like chocolate or cinnamon?  The people working there were very helpful and friendly.

I liked that when I asked for Iced Tea I received real iced tea and not a strange funky flavor one like many places give you. This place recently opened and our server was very attentive and took the time to explain the menu to us. He strongly favored the halibut tacos and said they were his single favorite thing on the menu so I ordered them.   I need to note we were here for lunch so this is only a lunch review based on just one visit.  I soon received them and they were I think the most figure friendly meal I ever had out. Aprox. three oz. of halibut between two lettuce leaves (instead of tortillas) , pickled onion , Mexi style tomatoes , avocado , radish,  some crunchy greens and a very mild sauce. This plate was a bit on the mild side for my taste but maybe the intention of the dish was to taste the fish and not to over power it. This plate came with a side of black beans that were seasoned and had some flavors going on. This seemed like a very healthy meal to have out. I also liked that they used halibut and not something like muddy catfish or tilapia.  My husband tried the Charcuterie. It was sort of like an around the world kind of plate. It had five kinds of meat , a Chinese Sausage, a Hungarian Sausage, Italian Meats, Fig Jam, Toast, whole grain mustard, pickles, olives and a wedge of Brie Cheese.  I noticed an interesting Connecticut Style Steamed burger on the menu that you just don't find too often that might have been fun to try. Someone seated next to us got one and I thought it looked good.   3.5 stars Rounded up for above average service.

The correct address is 20020 N. 59TH AVE .  I note this place is very new and still working things out and has potential so it's worth a try.  We tried several things here and I think some things are better than others.  From what I tried on my visit I think the Beef Asada and the Chile Verde are much better than the fish here. The meats were flavorful but terribly dry when we were here.  The fish from the fish tacos might have been a frozen product that had little flavor and it was kind of dry for fish.  They have a selection of house made sauces and a few condiments to add to your dish.  Customer service is not the best.  I ordered a side of Hot Carrots (.99 cents) before I noticed they are a free condiment. They should have told me it was on the sauce bar. But it made me a little more mad when the woman working there runs me an empty cup and tells me to fill it up myself from the freebie bar. If they are on freebie bar why charge me????    Like I already said they are new and still working things out hope your visit is better.

After one visit I gather that Shawarma King is very above average in the kind of cuisine it is. (Fast Casual Middle Eastern) I really enjoyed all the unique offerings and different variations of these Mid East Classics. Overall everything was very good, I enjoyed how different this place was.  We never had Cheese Boubak before so we tried them. They look like Giant Spring Rolls but are stuffed with a seasoned cheese blend and are tasty anyone would like them.  I tried the Vegetarian Feast Plate so I could try as much as possible. My plate was made of Felafel's, Hummus, Babaganoush, Purple Cabbage salad, Pickles, and I think Arabic Salad. (menu listed Tabbouleh but I heard after I received my meal they were out of Tabbouleh for the day) and House Made Pitas.   The felafel's are very unique. They were the crispest ones I ever tried anywhere with a hard crunch. (I sort of worried about my fillings) They were made with fresh herbs but had a different seasonings than others I tried from other places. I'm not sure but I thought I tasted caraway in them. Dips were both good. I really enjoyed the Purple Cabbage salad as it was light and filling at the same time and is something not all other places offer. The chopped vegetables were very bright with lemon and flavored of fresh parsley. The pitas were fresh baked and were much better than from a package but were a sturdy style.  My husband tried a Combo Plate it had one dip on it I wasn't familiar with. It was thick and white and tasted sort of cheesy garlicky and lemony. I tried the chicken, it was white meat but very tasty.  They don't offer Yemenite Sauce but offer Sriracha if you desire a hot kick. I think that's kind of odd as they are not at all similar in taste.  The owner seems nice and ask how everything is but communication isn't the best but that is how it is at these kind of places.  Above average, something different and worth a try!

We went in for our annual eye examinations. My husband needed a new pair of glasses and I reordered my contact lenses.  To get my contacts there was much confusion on the floor end and they were unsure of how many boxes to sell me and picked wrong amount of boxes that were later corrected. This process took about an hour. I had to come back to pick up some boxes and they were mis-filed and it took over a half hour for them to give me my remaining boxes.  Later my husband goes in to pick up his glasses. He tries them on and can't see out of one side. They try and try and do many adjustments. They suggest him walking around the mall with them. His head hurts from the glasses and returns. They tell him to see the Dr. After much time and examinations the Dr. discovers that the wrong prescription was made.   OK they made a mistake.  Then instead of saying I'm sorry Mr. so and so we will fix it they make him go threw the whole ordering process again and this takes another half hour.  He gets a call maybe a week later saying his glasses are in. He goes in to pick them up and comes home.  IT"S A GOOD THING HE HAS ME as he paid for something he didn't receive.  As soon as he walks in the door I can see from a mile away the glasses aren't made correctly as they didn't polish the rimless part as they were paid extra to do. The edges just looked like bright headlights. NOW THIS IS A $80.00 charge that he was charged for that he didn't get. We drive back to Visionworks and they fix after we inform them about the rims and we wait another half hour.  I wouldn't say don't go here as in the end all was fixed but I would say just be on your game as they make errors.

Tiny not too fancy restaurant that serves up some seriously good food.   We shared a lunch bento box and some sushi.  The Beef Bulgogi was insanely delicious. It lacked heat but had great flavors that were very balanced and the beef was tender like butter.   The sushi I tried was all very clean tasting. The was nicely seasoned and held together well. Sushi was seasoned under the fish like it should be.  The spicy tuna roll really was very good. Best one I've had since my favorite sushi place changed ownership. It was truly spicy and had other flavors going on to make it delicious.  It's not on the menu but for $1.00 more you can order real wasabi sauce that is much better than the wasabi paste they serve.  One of the best for sushi in this area.

Most of the food we tried seemed very old and leftover. All the food we were served was just luke warm and almost cold when it arrived. They never even bothered to unwrap the Musubi from it's plastic wrap. The food reminded me of food from the worst budget buffet I ever went to.   I tried a Bento Zip Box with Pineapple Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken and Mahi Mahi with Potato salad. Both Fried Entrees (Pineapple Chicken and Mahi Mahi ) were almost cold and when I bit into them Oil squished out and left a bad after taste in my mouth. I found both fried entrees inedible. The Teriyaki Chicken was cooked nice but was also almost cold with a not to offensive bottled cold sauce squirted on. It didn't taste so fresh but was the most edible thing on my plate. My white rice seemed over cooked and mushy and also didn't taste fresh. I kept eating the potato salad trying to figure out what was wrong with it and my conclusion is no salt or pepper was used in it. I liked that they used fresh green onions in it but I think maybe the potatoes might have been old because it really didn't taste good.  Unfortunately my husband had a similar experience with his plate that was all different from mine. He had a Spam Musubi that still had plastic wrap on it. He couldn't eat the Kalua Pork it did have some fresh green onions on it but other than that it lacked flavor and seemed unseasoned and was almost cold. The most edible part of his plate was the Katsu Chicken it seemed like it was made today but was also almost cold. The rice was overcooked, mushy and not so fresh tasting. The Macaroni Salad seemed like it was a month old. The Mayo had broken down to just paste like oil and was very offensive and horrible.  Approximately. 2/3rds inedible food.  Approximately 1/3 edible but not so great almost cold food.  Equals One star I will not return or recommend.  My stomach was turning for hours I thought I'd be sick. It was like catching Da Valley Fever from Da food. 5-14-14 I appreciate that the Da Valley Grill contacted me about my exsperience. I am certain this might have been fluke exsperience since they didn't have their regular cook on. But the honest truth is if the food wasn't old it was very mishandled or equipment wasn't working right. I do appreciate their concern and are very glad they are looking in to what happened. I was hoping this would be a new favorite since I am found of another Hawaiian Eatery in the Valley and this place offers different options. I do hope they figured out what happened and I hope this was just an isolated  circumstance.

I feel like I never had Thai Food until I dined at Two Sisters Thai Food it was THAT life changing.  I tried the Esan Gang Gai, it was a clear curry made with Lao Basil, a green vegetable possibly called Pat Krana and seasoned with fresh Dill. The Aroma from this dish was intoxicating. I tried to ask my server about the ingredients in this dish but she wasn't about to translate any of them. She did say the green vegetable in my dish is believed to be a most healthy vegetable. The vegetable was sort of like spinach but with very thin almost like celery stems.  My husband had the Pad Kee Mow and it also was unlike any Thai Dish we had anywhere else. Not sweet, not saucy, just very flavorful.  This place isn't the fanciest with a kitchen in the middle of the dining room but is neat and was clean with a few Maricopa grade "A" inspections posted by the door.  On the restaurant's website they state they prepare 4 styles of Thai Food. North Eastern or Esan Thai, Central Thai, Thai/Chinese and Thai/American.   If your used to Americanized Thai this might not be your destination but if you want something that seems like you took a trip to Thailand this is it!

After watching Multi Awarding Winning Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown in Northern Thailand I got the Impression that most Thai Food we eat is Americanized. I recall him saying on the show something like, "Your not going to see your Pad Thai or Green Curry here!"  Last time I was here  I had the Thai-Lao Chicken Curry uniquely flavored with Lao Basil and Dill. I remember the waitress told me that this was a dish that they DO EAT in Thailand.   This place isn't average.  This time we started with an egg roll. It was different and stuffed with a lot of fresh grated carrot and a little chicken. The dipping sauce was sweet and also spicy.  I had the Esan Style Red Curry with Chicken. Esan Style is made without Coconut Milk. I thought it was delicious. I haven't noticed this dish offered at other Thai Restaurants in the area.   They offer different styles of Thai here including Americanized.  The Take Out Menu has descriptions of the food and easier to order from than the menu you get seated with.  They offer brown rice but it's a half hour wait.  They have a Spectra water system that makes all their water like spring water and they say their food taste better and is healthier because of it.  The restaurant has Grade "A" Maricopa Health Inspections posted.  The Food make you feel like taking a trip to Thailand!

I wrote a very honest mostly positive review on Cuttlefish while they were newly opened. To my surprise the owner felt the need to contact me to come back to enjoy a better meal and make me a fan. I normally DON'T accept any of these invitations but this one was so sincere and unnecessary I felt different and the truth is if you read my first review all the fish we had was great anyway! So here's another honest review.  We decide we will have wine with dinner. We didn't order the Silver Oak but we did notice the $90. price wasn't much of a mark up because it sells for $75. at the store and were very impressed with that because many other restaurants mark the wine bottles at double or better.  They started us off with delicious warm squid ink bread and olive bread served with a fresh herb garlic butter that was scrumptious.  We started with a Caesar Salad and a Pappardelle. The salad was good and fresh with house cured fish and a thin bright with fresh lemon dressing adorned with crisp made of cheese. The Pappardelle really totally exceeded my expectations. The beef was melt on your mouth tender and was full of flavor. The pasta was spot on perfect and the sauce was delicious. This is a Five star dish.  Both the White Sturgeon and the Wild Halibut were prepared to perfection. The Halibut maybe the most unforgiving of fish was Moist but cooked threw and tasty with a nice crust on it. This dish came with a side of stuffed gnocchi. The gnocchi were very light perfect pillows that were covered in a tasty light truffle cream sauce that anybody would like.  The Sturgeon had this really outstanding presentation with tiny pretty supreme blood orange segments adorning the pesto crusted fish. Perfect cooked sun chokes. The White Bean and lava stew was excellent too.  Service was OUTSTANDING as we were checked on all threw dinner by our waiter Matt and other servers and were also made to feel very welcome by the manager.  In the end I can't say anything needed improvement. Everything was very good. The Fish was all prepared perfect. The pastas were excellent and perfect. Everything tasted great and service was outstanding. I will return and recommend.

I had a FABULOUS exsperience at Pomo. You walk in and it's so airy, modern and beautiful. I partially liked the wall with the potted fresh herbs growing. Pomo serves certified Neapolitan Pizzas among many other Italian dishes like pastas and rice balls.  Our server was extremely welcoming and very knowledgeable about the menu and in Italian food in general.  I decided to order one of the seasonal special pizzas called the Stracchino and Rucola because I never had Stracchino Cheese before. I soon receive the pizza and everything thing about it was perfect. A nicely prepared crust with good structure and chewiness, the sweetest charred cherry tomatoes, peppery fresh arugula, and that very special melty, creamy more flavorful than mozzarella cheese with the perfect touch of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It was a delicious pizza and I'm glad I ordered it.  This really was a 5 star exsperience.   Due to I go out to eat often and have been to many places I've come to the conclusion that pizza places can't be five stars because pizza making is part science and also mostly INTUITION you vary the recipe on the the humidity and the life in the yeast. I've been to Pizzeria Bianco and La Piazza al Forno a number of times and I can tell you they aren't consistent so I don't expect that Pomo can be consistent either.  If I have three consecutive perfect pizzas from Pomo I will change my rating to 5 stars.  4.5 stars

The ten courses for two special is PHENOMENAL and just might be as good as it gets for Mexican Cuisine in this area. You can't help being delighted with all the bountiful flavorful tasty plates that give you the feeling you were on a tour along Central Mexico. Everything  we tried was delicious and our dining companions were also thrilled and impressed with the well crafted food. (This now is a new favorite of theirs too.) Many other great Mexican cuisine can be found around town but what's here at Los Sombreros it's a finer dining experience with a very comfortable attractive dining room and shaded patio and very attentive service.   I thought a few things to go wrong since this was their first weekend open and the multi course menu requires above average service but to my surprise things went well like clockwork.  For $75. the menu per couple went like this.  Chips and salsa (2) Corn Chowder Soups (2) Crispy Hibiscus Tacos Fig and Panela Cheese Salad Crab and Mango Salad Snapper and Corn in Chipotle Balsamic honey sauce Trout and Cauliflower in lemon butter caper sauce Chicken Breast stuffed with goat cheese, huitlacohe in chipotle tomato sauce Chile Rellenos Pork Chop with tamarind mole House Made Ice Cream  You should plan the ten course event to take over two hours to enjoy.

Very casual restaurant with mostly long communal benches to sit at. This isn't your usual restaurant I never seen a sausage salad on anybody's menu before. This restaurant specializes serving the Cornish Pasty. They offer a multitude of varieties and a long list of vegetarian ones to choose from.   I ordered the traditional "Oggie" pasty. It was a thin crispy crust stuffed with nicely seasoned moist beef, potatoes, onions and rutabagas. It was delicious as it was but when you hit it with the wine gravy then it becomes super delicious!  As delicious as my pasty was I'm glad I stopped eating at half. When I got up I felt full. My waiter was very helpful and efficient and offered me extra sauce to take home with the yummy half I brought home. I don't think it's possible to leave hungry from here.  The parking lot is very small and you might not get a spot. You can easily park across the street by the shops.  A very solid 4 stars...

This is a very small casual sleek MODERN gourmet burger joint that also offers cocktails and beers. You're most likely coming here for the insanely great grass fed beef burgers. I had a really terrific beef burger from here before so this time I tried the sushi grade ahi tuna burger. The chopped up tuna patty was held together with whole grain and seemed light as air. The patty was topped with buttery avocado for richness and that spicy sauce made the burger really delicious. I also liked that the bun didn't seem too big and was sturdy but also seemed light at the same time. We shared the non-traditional deviled eggs. They were really large and tasty with a little fresh dill and pretty pieces of beetroot. We also shared the shattered potato chips. They were crisp and some had soft centers. The chips came with jalapeño sauce and labne. The jalapeño sauce that came with the chips was very tasty and the Lebanese style yogurt cooled you down so things don't get too spicy. When you're done they offer you complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies.   The help were extremely helpful and friendly.  The restaurant is hospital-like sparkling clean.   They offer a small dog friendly patio.  Parking lot is small.  A complimentary valet is located across the street.  High quality ingredients prepared to perfection with Great Service in a pristine clean environment deserves 5 Stars.

Short Story -  Order the Smoked Marlin or Chicken Mole Tacos or a Quesa and enjoy the salsa bar.  Long Story -  You will be razzle dazzled by the ENORMOUS selection of salsas for you to try on the salsa bar. I think we were told seventeen but it might have been twenty. I tried the unusual creamy pecan salsa and a grilled vegetable salsa and whole lot of others that were very interesting.  One of the specialties of the house are the hand made Quesas. The Quesa was described as a quesadilla but seemed very different to me as I would describe it as a Mexican GINACOTTI or fried Calzone. We shared an all vegetable one stuffed with an assortment of vegetables including spinach and cheeses. It was very tasty and I like anybody would enjoy it.   Out of the four tacos we tried the Smoked Marlin Taco and the Chicken Mole Taco were the best and the ones I'd recommend. The Smoked Marlin really tasted like Fish Tacos I had in Mexico. They were full flavored and dimensional with layers of cilantro and the right amount of smokiness and spice and that just right crunch. The Mole sauce from the chicken tacos was very well made and heavily coated the tender tasty dark meat chicken and was very good.   Nothing was wrong with the beef or pork tacos but they seemed very average after the Smoked Marlin and the Chicken Mole.  The Quesa and the tacos were a very generous portion and more than we expected. I didn't think two tacos a person and a shared quesa would be that much food but it was.  Best tacos I had so far in Glendale.

The Food and Service surpassed my expectations by leaps and bounds.   They started us out with these tasty fresh complimentary donut holes with maple butter.  As busy as our waitress Sara was waiting on Tables all over the restaurant and Patio she still managed to give us amazing service making us feel very welcomed and comfortable ordering.   All the food we were served was paced out really perfect.  The Velvety Curry Pear Soup was very good with sweetness and spices and the bowl was painted with Hibiscus that gave it an interesting unexpected twang.  We also shared the Local Roasted Cauliflower. The combination of Charred Sweet Onions, Capers, Dried Fruit, Taleggio Cheese, Toasted Pine Nuts and Chives made the Cauliflower very special and couldn't be anything except delicious.  I had the Spinach Salad. It had everything going on with it and was very balanced. Dates, Pickled Onions, Kumquats, Labne and Harissa Vinaigrette. Every bite was a pleasure. I had added Chicken as Sara suggested and it seemed like it was carefully Sous Vide possibly at 146 degrees for two to maybe four hours meaning that it was perfect.  Even the Chef as busy as he was went beyond his duties running food, busing tables and treating the restaurant as if it was his own. The Binkley's should be proud they have some outstanding staff.  I don't know if next time will be five stars but I am certain if it isn't it will be close.

The food and service surpassed my expectations by leaps and bounds.   I enjoyed a great meal here about two weeks back and wondered if lightening could strike twice.  The $30.00 three course Restaurant Week Menu with Optional $15.00 Wine or Beer Pairing was Phenomenal.  I soon received my first course of Tempura Eggplant sprinkled with Bonito Flakes, Shaved Jalapeño and Black Garlic Vinaigrette. The Tempura was nice and crispy and the eggplant was creamy not soggy. The shaved Jalapeño added the right kick and the Black Garlic Vinaigrette added the right sweetness. It also was a bonus that the serving was large so my husband got to try that one out too.   My main course was the Baked Trout with super great Red Potatoes. The Trout came out on this cast iron dish that was extremely hot with herb butter. The fish was nice and fresh and very moist. I thought it would over cook but it didn't and remained moist and hot and was simplistic but perfect and tasted great. The Red Potatoes were Amazing and were cooked perfect with crispy edges so creamy on the inside and seasoned well. They were embellished with Chopped Egg and White Anchovy Vinaigrette and were excellent. The portion was big and my husband happily helped me eat them too. The wine pairing was a buttery Chardonnay and I normally Hate Chardonnay it's usually my least favorite wine but the pairing was magical with this dish.  I'm a sucker for Passion Fruit so I went for the Coconut Mousse that came with Passionfruit Curd Blueberry Cake Ginger and Coconut Flakes. The Mousse was unlike any Mousse I ever had before. It had a hard shell that I suspect to involve Molecular Gastronomy. Light as cloud Mousse came out when you broke the shell and complimented the intense delicious Passion Fruit Curd and everything else on the plate.  Service, Food and Value were Outstanding!

I purchased a Grilled Chicken Curry Sandwich to go to take on the plane. I do have to say this was the best airport food I had so far and have never given any airport food 4 stars before. The filling was delicious and enhanced with sherry soaked raisins. The bread was a good quality made with grains and had a slight sweetness that paired well with the sandwich filling. My sandwich stayed neat and never got messy to eat. The bread stayed dry and didn't get soaked by the chicken salad.   This sandwich did cost $13.00 but I thought it was worth it.   My husband felt different and enjoyed his $5.99 burrito from somewhere else.

Boondocks is a Modern Sports Bar that has a really Big Patio with High Top Tables, Ping Pong tables, TVs and other Games. Many but not all the drinks on the cocktail menu feature fresh squeezed Grapefruit Juice.   They offer lots of interesting appetizers and shareable plates and they also have a Children's Menu. The menu had a wide assortment of sandwiches and all kinds of interesting burgers.   Many things sounded interesting and I went with the Bibi Burger. I was sold on the Harissa and Raisin Marmalade and ordered it being not sure about ground turkey. But it was delicious! The Turkey was cooked like it should be but was flavorful and juicy and I really liked that spicy and sweet taste with the Turkey.   My husband had the Sin Burger and it was really delicious too. It had Jalapeño Marmalade, Pickled Cabbage, Cheddar Cheese and a blistered Jalapeño on a four grind beef patty. For his side he picked the potato salad and it was good too.  The Burgers are very solid here.  I'm not sure if they offer any full dinners here as it seems to be just a very casual menu.  Service was very good.  They are open 7 days a week for 11-2am  I'd return.

This is a very small Peruvian Restaurant with a bar. They serve mostly Peruvian Food thats heavy with rice and lots of potatoes. They start everyone of with tasty complimentary corn nuts. We started with the Peruvian Specialty Appetizer called papas a la huancaina that means basically a boiled potato topped with a creamy chile cheese sauce. I thought it tasted good but for me this dish is an acquired taste kind of dish because of the texture.   I ordered the Arroz Chaufa (a chicken fried rice) because it sounded like the lightest dish on the menu. The chicken in my dish was developed with flavor and was very moist. I thought this dish was tasty but it was an extremely large portion so I took half home.  My husband had the Frijol con Seco a la Nortena (basically a beef stew with rice and beans). I tried a little piece of beef that also was prepared well and was flavorful and moist. The pickled onions were bright and bursting with lime flavor. This was also a large portion.  The pictures of the desserts looked interesting and mostly different from other desserts I've seen and our server talked me into getting his favorite dessert the crema volteada. It was like a very dense flan with a dark sugar coating. It seemed rich and wasn't too sweet.  Service was very friendly and welcoming.

I know going to a newly opened restaurant usually involves hiccups in food preparation and service but I was not prepared for a MASSIVE TRAIN WRECK. This restaurant is NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME.  I thought Taco Haus meant a place with lots of tacos but really they only offer five tacos, A Veggie, Chicken, Steak, Pork Belly, Fish either grilled or Fried. We ordered one of each  since they are small street tacos, a chicken mole empanada and street corn to share.  Our server said he'd bring us salsas and sauces and did come back with bottled sauces but no salsas.  First comes out our Chicken Mole Empanada. I liked the unique crispy shell of the empanada but I didn't recognize any sort of mole there anywhere. A white slightly herb-ed cream was under the Empanada and it was so mildly seasoned I couldn't tell what it was suppose to be but it was sort of tangy and I thought it might be tarter sauce. Whatever it was I didn't like it.  The Rotisserie Chicken Taco was MEMORABLE because it was the DRY-EST Chicken I ever had and was like SAW DUST in my mouth and also was next to tasteless.  The pork belly taco just seemed like it was deep fried and also lacked flavors.  Similar stories with the fried fish, veggie, steak tacos and street corn. EVERYTHING WAS UNDER SEASONED.  My grilled Fish taco was INEDIBLE. It was either spoiled or next to spoiled. It tasted like rotting fish. I did inform the waiter and he took it away and insisted on bringing me something else. I almost died. In my head I'm thinking I really don't want anything. Everything was terrible. My husband asks for a veggie taco to replace the fish. My waiter told me EVERYBODY WHO HAD THE GRILLED FISH SAID THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT.  If EVERYBODY doesn't like it something is wrong with it. (fish taco was removed from check and manager did apologized about the fish)  And Lastly the street corn was a terrible concoction. It seemed like old not so fresh water boiled corn that got slightly browned mixed with popcorn and a spoonful of mayo with so little anything else it had no resemblance  or taste to street corn and had little flavor on it's own.  I only heard good things about the chef from here but I seriously worry about his pallet.  Everything fell short.  SLIGHT UPDATE 2-2-14  Fish Tacos have been removed from the menu since my review.

Based really on only my lunch sandwich for price and quality The Pink Pony is deserving of four stars.  I like the cool modern decor and the roofed patio and the cool music they were playing. I didn't partake in alcohol but they offered interesting sounding drinks, craft beers and reasonably priced wines.  It was hard to decide on lunch because they offer many high Carb tasty sounding appetizers pizzas and sandwiches. I do note they also offer healthier options like several  salads. If I remember correctly none of the salads offered have chicken and I don't remember reading any chicken on the menu.   Two sandwiches caught my eye!  House made pastrami and the Fried Walleyed Pike. It was hard to decide but I went with Walleyed Pike because it's so rare that you can get it in Arizona and when you do it's expensive! Walleyed Pike is a really delicious Mild Meaty Fish that is Way above average that's very good.  I soon receive my platter. My sandwich is as Big as a Whale! I picked the Caesar Salad option thinking it might be lighter than fries,chip or tots (all house made) but it was topped with the tastiest crusty chewy bread I had to bite into. I decide I am not able to eat my meal as a sandwich and really only needed the fish and salad because that's enough food for me. My fish tasted good the batter seemed light and crisp. My greens were fresh and had a generous amount of what seemed like quality Italian Cheese. I did taste my Brioche Bun and it was so soft and fresh and rich and like I said before the grilled crusty bread that topped my salad was really delicious bread. For me this platter has too much bread but I don't feel the need to remove any stars because what I tried was all good and a bargain at only $12.00.  Service was very much above average.  I'll go back!

Since my last review the chef and menu has changed. They still have that cool modern decor and also play cool music in the background. I didn't partake in alcohol but they still offer interesting sounding cocktails, craft beers and reasonably priced wine.  The Lunch menu offers some indulgent options that are carb heavy but also some healthier options too. To me the biggest change I noticed since my last visit was much more beef options on the dinner menu.  The tasty walleye pike sandwich I had last time was replaced with a house smoked salmon plate. It came out different than I was expecting and was more of a salad than a platter but still tasted good. The salmon seemed fresh and only had a light smoke so it tasted good to me. It was adorned with watercress, tomato jam, mascarpone cheese, roasted onions, fried capers and then topped with chopped up pony pretzels. The pony pretzels have a very buttery taste like Aunti Em's but taste good with the salad. It was nice that every bite had a different taste. This dish was described as also being served with beer mustard with it and I think they left that out.  My husband had the Hot Mess. It was basically two tortillas topped with a meat green chili sauce, some cheeses, pickled onions, quark and two eggs. This might be a signature dish here because it's very recommended and also very popular. My husband asked for the quark on the side because he thought he wouldn't like it.   As our luck would have it the meal came out with quark so he sent it back. After a short time a new one came out with the quark on the side. The manager apologies to us about the mistake and does stop by after a few bites to ask how things are.  Not a solid 4 stars only because of human errors but I thought the food we tried was good enough for four stars.

I guess if Jesus ate Brisket he might eat it here.  We arrived at 10:50am that's 10 minutes before they opened and the lot was packed I thought we'd have to leave but they have someone directing traffic and told us were we could park. We decided we'd wait in the long line that wrapped around the outside and behind the small area of out door picnic tables. During out wait in line people were passing out bottles of water so you didn't pass out in the heat. A woman in line in front of us kept raving about the pecan pie from 20 some minutes straight so I thought I had to try it too. We waited ABOUT AN HOUR till we were in the door to order.   We finally get in the door to order. The meat is hand cut to order and the person doing it is fast, friendly and efficient and also gives out samples to people who aren't sure on what they are ordering.   Between my plate and my husbands plate we had the Moist Brisket (they also have lean) Turkey Breast, Pulled Pork, House Made Sausage and all four sides Meaty Beans (from all the meat scraps, Cheesy Grits, Potato Salad and Cole Slaw.  All the meats were very good but on the day we were here the Moist Brisket really stood out above the rest. It was so succulent with just the right amounts of careful smoking and spice. The ends of the pieces were a little too fatty for me but my husband likes them that way so it worked out for sharing.   For me some things were less than stellar such as the slightly dry and bland potato salad and the too sweet and too gooey pecan pie but I don't think I need to remove them a whole star when the meats and hospitality was so high.  Really a 4.5 mostly because of casual and limited table option atmosphere, and the long wait in line. It's sort of like being at the Pizzeria Bianco of BBQ and you just have to wait....  4.5 Stars

Based on just one lunch visit it's too hard to determine if the Grassroots Kitchen is deserving of four or five stars but I can tell you it was pretty DARN GOOD! Also very solid and above average!  I was going to order a Chicken Salad of some sort but the server tells me about the Fish Sandwich of the day that was Ono and the Vegetable Side of the day that was Tri Color Cauliflower with Mustard Sauce, Pecans, Golden Raisins so I had to go with that. It was so good simple but so many details done to perfection. The good quality  Bun was carefully toasted and buttered. The Tomato and pickle slices were very high quality. The sauce was extremely flavorful and delicious and the fish was cooked to perfection.   The Farmers Side of Tri Color Cauliflower was also fresh and delicious and very much above average.  My husband was thrilled with the Shrimp Po Boy and Jalapeño Cheddar Grits! He said his plate was so good that it will be very hard to order something different next time.  As delicious as my sandwich was I was careful not to completely fill my self up and held back eating half my bun to save room for their specialty dessert Key Lime Pie.  WOW this REALLY was the BEST Key Lime Pie I ever tasted. It isn't a beauty for presentation but the crust ratio was perfect. It was the just right sweet, tangy and Just bitter enough. Wow it was really good!  Service was great too!  4.5 Stars

At the time of this review the Linq dosn't have taxi service. I am sure they will improve after my review but this is how it is now. The closest Taxi service is at the flamingo so you have to trot threw there.IThey don't have the best shops or eateries but was told the ferris wheel is the largest one in the country. Each bin holds 40 people. It's an up and coming place and is sure to improve in time. The Brooklyn Bowl newly opened here and is also sure to improve and become a destination in Las Vegas.

For an Authentic taste of Italy Scottsdale AZ might be your closest spot. According to the Forno Fabbri Website they received an Italian Certificate that meets the certification for Italian Foods. It means the recipes, ingredients, and machinery used are certified Italian and have the same values, characteristics and use the same methods of the past and without modification or alteration.  I started with a slice of Margherita Pizza Romana. It was only $3.75 so I thought it would be a little square but it was big enough to be a meal. It was simple and not heavy. It was made with the flavors you know and expect.  My husband started with the Pasta & Fagioli. Neither of us ever tasted a version of this classic soup that we tried here. Here the Pasta Fagioli was a thinner vegetable based soup that was only very light with seasoning and flavor but did have a good amount of beans in it.  I had the Tonno Salad. ($6.75) (AKA Dieters Platter) This was maybe the lightest salad I ever had anywhere. I knew being priced at $6.95 it would be on the light side. All it was were fresh mixed greens, some sliced onion, tomatoes, some Italian Tuna and maybe a spoonful of Extra Virgin Olive Oil mixed threw. No seasonings or spices were added. Very very simple and very VERY light.  My husband had the Piccante (Hot Calabrese Salami Sandwich). He didn't ask what the rosa sauce was and just assumed it would all be good to him. He asked the server what the sauce was and she told him it was ketchup mixed with mayonnaise. I don't know if the server was correct or not about those ingredients. My husband's Father is from Italy and raised his children (my husband)  not to eat things he didn't eat in Italy. I don't know what Italy is like today but in my father-in-law's day according to him Italians don't use mayonnaise and many other American Condiments like ketchup. SO my husband asked the server if she could do something about removing the sauce. She said she'd make him a new sandwich without the sauce. He enjoyed the new sandwich very much and said the salami in it was really VERY very Good.  This is a small casual place including a small Italian Grocery without produce.  If you are modest you might want to avoid the ladies restroom. It is clean and attractive but the wall between the stalls is only semi-transparent. I don't want to draw you a picture about it. Just use your imagination.  3.5 Stars rounded up out of respect for what they are trying to do.

If you were a fan of Abe's Deli of Scottsdale then you should be a fan of Miller's Deli and Grill for similar deli treats you had before. The new restaurant  and menu has been trimmed down and the deli case is also gone but most of the top favorites still are here.   We had our own smorgasbord and tried a variety of things.  My husband never had a potato knish before so we ordered one. (appetizer $4.) It was very fresh and came out warm with a side of beef gravy. It tasted just like fresh ones I had before from a bakery I used to go to. I ate only a quarter of it just to try but my husband who never had a knish before enjoyed it and finished it off.   I went with the soup and half sandwich and tried the matzo ball soup. What impressed me the most about the soup was that it was very fresh tasting and the white meat chicken in it was very tender and correctly cooked. (I hate dry chicken and just get bummed when I get dry chicken out. Places that give me dry chicken I usually give two stars.) The soup broth was very thin and light as Matzo Ball is suppose to be because this soup is about the ball. I liked the fresh still with body carrots in it and the pasta was fresh and not soggy. The Matzo ball was the lightest fluffiest one I ever had. I do prefer Matzo Ball soup seasoned with dill but not everyone does. No dill in the Matzo Ball soup here but it was good as it was and is enough to feed one person.   I tasted a spoonful of my husband's Sweet and Sour Cabbage soup. It was tasty I might try that one next time?  My husband went with the Reuben Sliders ($9.75) but with the kraut and sauce on the side. To his surprise he really enjoyed the kraut and especially the house made dressing as it was really delicious. The sliders are considered one of Phoenix Arizona's top five things to try according to the AZ Republic as they are very tasty. They are Three  Sandwiches of House Own Recipe pickled corned beef,  House Own recipe Pastrami and Brisket grilled on potato latkes. I tasted each and all were good but I liked the pastrami best.  My half sandwich was the pastrami on rye. My sandwich was tasty as it was but would have been much better and elevated as the sliders were if I asked for it hot so if you get the corned beef or pastrami make sure you ask for it hot because it's much tastier that way. I liked that the bread was real rye and not that squishy Arizona Rye you get at other places. The cole slaw was very fresh tasting but on the sweet side but had a pleasant celery seed after taste that I liked. ($12.50 !/2 sandwich with soup)  Our server Sean was OUTSTANDING very friendly and helpful.  They have a beautiful large dog friendly patio and free Wifi.  Mazel Tov!     They did the soft opening as they are still working things out but Really did a Good Job!

Things seemed promising when we walked in. The atmosphere seemed like a fun English Pub Style with lots of wood and some stone work.  Things seemed even more promising when they presented us with samples of complimentary beer.  Then things went down hill.  We ordered two pasties.  The waitress come back a few minutes later and says they are out of one of them. No big deal we pick another.  A few minutes latter the waitress comes back again and says they are out of our second choice  so another few minutes pass by and they are out of the second choice. So we have to make a third choice but don't pick the chicken one because we are out of that one two because our baker isn't in yet. The waitress says you can have the meat n taters for free so my husband asks whats in the meat in taster? The waitress wasn't trained to know what was in it so she just got a menu for my husband to read and he says OK.  So I'm thinking only yesterday's leftovers are available.  We wait a long time for the meat hand pies to arrive.  Unfortunately I didn't check my silverware until my food arrived. The first two silverwares I unrolled WERE FILTHY! (see photo) the other rolls didn't look as bad so I used my water to wash them down. I NOTE IF I KNEW THESE WERE SO FILTHY I WOULD HAVE LEFT before the food arrived. I couldn't help but thinking if the silverware was THAT BAD then maybe the plates and pots and pans might be just as BAD OR WORSE.     Our Meat Pies arrive and mine the Traditional isn't awful but isn't so good. I think the recipe is good meaning if it was made fresh it would be good but the one I had was all dried out inside with dry meat in it and I already know it was leftover from at least yesterday. I did the right thing and told my waitress and she apologized but I do think management should have made an appearance at this point.  My stomach is spinning and I use the restroom. (see photo)  Then my stomach turned even more from the sewage smell and over flowing garbage. (It looked like Sara Silvia Stout was in charged of the garbage duty.......Google Sara Silvia Stout Song).  This place has potential but  Management needs to train staff on menu. Management needs to have someone on who can make the pasties during opening hours. Management needs to supervise basic cleaning duties. Management needs to take an interest in on going problems.  No I will not return or recommend.  Draft House or Drek House?

I called Sears Appliance Repair to make an appointment and they sold me a Warranty Called a Smart Deal that would include the service call and cap off the repair at $279.Yesterday. It would include the service fee and all parts and labor and guarantee the repair for a year. Today the repairman shows up and informs me THEY WON'T HONER MY WARRANTY they sold me yesterday because I have a GE Brand Refrigerator. The repairman was in my home at least an extra hour just spent on the phone talking to various people in Sears canceling my contract and appointment and then setting up a new appointment for the repair without a warranty.    Also the address on my receipt reads.  Sears Home Services Pacific SouthWest Dist. El Cajon CA 92021  I doubt the repairman drove from CA.  Seems like a scam.   I can NO longer TRUST Sears.  I will NEVER BUY or RECOMMEND any GE Appliance.  As an few hour later Update. My husband complained to their service department and Sears refunded us what we thought was fair. I'm happy for that but it wouldn't of happened unless my husband complained to them. I didn't delete or change the Yelp Rating because other people need to know as they might go threw the same thing.

Amazing low prices for fresh really good food.  This is a clean casual little place were you order at the counter and seat yourself.  As we were ordering the cashier hands us some cream of zucchini soup to try. It was a nice surprise and I have to say it was really good.  We ordered two plates of tacos the 1/2 Lb Ribeye (4 tacos $6.99) and the Pescado (3 tacos $7.49) Both plates came out nicely presented with a Grilled Mexican Onion, Blistered Chili, and Sauces. Everything was tasty and everything was fresh. They have a condiment bar and I really enjoyed adding the pickled onions to the Ribeye taco.  This place seems very solid.

The Carefree Bistro is a small casual upscale restaurant that serves seasonal American food. They only serve natural fed meat, organic free range chicken and locally grown produce as much as possible. Hint hint.....that means you will be spending more because those things are quality and cost more. They offer a comfortable roomy looking bar, a stylish dining room and an outdoor dining patio.  Based on only one dining experience the main things we tried were outstanding but a few things were odd.  I had the blacked petrale sole sandwich with truffle fries. I thought it was a delicious sandwich. Lots of flavors coming though. I also thought the house made bread for my sandwich was tasty. As tasty as the house made tarter sauce was... the sandwich was covered with too much sauce so I would ask for sauces on the side next time. The fries had a similar texture to frozen fries and were fried with real truffle shavings. The fries did taste like truffle. A side of balsamic ketchup was on the plate but for my taste it didn't go with anything on the plate.   My husband had the grilled chicken sandwich with some sort of aioli on the side. The chicken in his sandwich was so delicious it was memorable. Juicy, flavorful, the works. It had melty creamy goat cheese on it and I think some pesto. The aioli would have been overkill for either of us.   We tried the house made prickly pear gelato for dessert. I liked that they offered such a unique flavor but for me the flavor in the gelato was very hard to identify. That means I wouldn't order it again.  For me the sandwiches were overall very good and made with high quality ingredients. I am a fan of that.   They do over sauce the sandwiches so if that sort of thing bothers you - you need to order some of the sauces on the side.  Service was efficient.

If your a fan of weak overly sweet margaritas, American/Mexi food that's bland, made with mostly very dry meats, in a very LOUD rubbing elbows bar and circus like atmosphere this is for YOU!   We entered the small restaurant and were almost knocked out by the loud volume of 70s classics anthem songs. As we sat we were quickly served a basket of half crushed chips and a salsa that lacked typical salsa flavors. Since there was four of us we ordered a pitcher of margaritas. After one sip I found the margarita cloyingly sweet and almost liquor free. It was like sucking on hummingbird water. Someone was running around giving everyone tickets for a floatation giveaway in the bar. The number was called soon after and someone left with a nifty corona floatation raft.  A table gets sat next to us and one person from our table really didn't have any space between them and the person from the next table.  We all thought tacos would be a good appetizer since they were on special for happy hour. My husband's short rib taco was very dry and was bland. It lacked fresh herbs and chiles, it was very flat as well as the tacos the other people had at the table. I had the snapper taco. They did prepare the fish better than all the other meats but it also lacked flavors and the flavor it did have was mostly just strong vinegar from the pickled onions. It lacked fresh green onions, fresh cilantro and a pop of chiles would have been nice. It just tasted vinegary with really super sweet chunks of pineapple that seemed like sweetened canned pineapple.  Out of the three appetizers, the drinks, and four dinners only my dinner was actually very good. But I got the kale and mango salad. My salad was prepared nicely, it was tasty and what really surprised me was that the salmon was cooked very nicely. I do note that this might have been the most expensive item on the menu and was a WHOPPING $18.75 for a salad. I know it's Scottsdale but that is higher pricing than what a salad cost on the strip in Las Vegas. I also note the salad did come in small and large and when I asked about the difference my interpretation was that the small looked like a four inch side salad and the large looked like about a foot.   My husband had the carnitas that was very dry and undeveloped with flavor.  One person at the table had the carne asada fajitas. They were very dry and that person told the waitress and she offered to make a new dish  and latter took the fajitas off the bill.  I thought our server was friendly and efficient.  This is a mixed review but overall it averages to below average so that equals two stars to me.

I haven't been to many Indian Bistros but when this new tiny one opened near the Asiana Market we decided to check it out.  We started with Shami Kabab, They were Chicken Lentil Croquettes that were tasty and came with a terrific mint chutney.  We shared Chicken Vindaloo and Chana Masala (chickpea stew). The Vindaloo was spicy with a building heat and the Chicken in was extremely tender and moist. The chickpea stew was tasty.  We also shared rice and Naan. The Naan seemed like it was made fresh to order.  The portions were very large and we had enough food for 4 meals.  I note I don't eat Indian Food Often so I don't know how the food stacks up to other Indian Bistros but based on the quality of the Chicken preparation and the Value I feel they are deserving of four stars and are worth a try when your in the area.  I plan to return it's great this new place opened!

I note this review is based on only one lunch visit.  This restaurant is an older small converted cape cod type of home that's adorned with lovely pomegranate trees by the entrance. Our server lets us pick our seat pours us water and offers many embellishments for the water. He seemed very professional.  I wasn't planing on tacos since I go to taco places for tacos but the special of Fish Tacos seemed most suited for me of the menu choices so I ordered them. They did take a while to prepare. I didn't time them but my husband said it was 25 minutes. I received three small double shelled street size tacos. They really didn't look so special but when I tasted them I found them wildly flavorful and similar tasting to the genuine Jalisco Tacos I had in Mexico. The tacos had perfect amount of heat for my taste. I liked what I think might have been a white corn flour blend tortillas they were on. They seemed better than average and I noticed that they were seasoned. I never noticed anyone seasoning double stacked tortillas before.  My husband was torn between a hamburger and the pork chili verde. I was hoping he'd go with the hamburger because it came with a side of the day of whimsical sounding watermelon and cheese curls. He went with the pork chili verde and said it was good. His plate came with what seemed like fresh baked flat bread.  The food was prepared well. Portions were on the small side but I note we had enough food. Pricing for the tacos ran slightly higher than other places I've been too  for the tacos ($12.) but they were very tasty so that's OK.

This review is based on Restaurant Week Dinner.  The menu differed slightly than what was posted on-line and the Pate first course and the second course peppercorn crusted filet were dropped. I'm not sure if they did offer the $12 wine paring as I forgot to ask about it and my server didn't mention it. Service seemed much more casual than from my last visit. The water is no longer garnished with fruit or rosemary embellishments and the restaurant specials weren't on a menu and were told to us verbally.  In a nut shell the the first courses and dinners were all delicious.  I got a large serving of crusty local Noble Bread Bruschetta topped with yummy fresh local dates and creamy goat cheese and cranberries. It was messy to eat but it was delicious.  My husband had the gazpacho. It didn't have lobster nuggets as stated on the restaurant week menu but it did have nicely prepared whole shrimp.  For dinner I had the Basil Salmon that came with ribbons of squash and creamy cheesy smoked grits. The salmon was really delicious and prepared PERFECT. It had a nice sear and was cooked medium rare. I liked the flavors very much, it was seasoned just right. Squash was tasty and was on the spicy side. The grits were very creamy cheesy and smokey.   My husband had the Bacon wrapped meatloaf that was over pulled pork that came with mashed potatoes and green beans. He said it was all delicious and this was a great choice for restaurant week.  I wasn't big on the desserts. I do note I am very picky about dessert and maybe it's just me. I tend not to care for most desserts I try out in restaurants anyway.  I was still happy I picked this restaurant for restaurant week the dinners were delicious!

I didn't try the sushi here yet so my review is only on the menu food.  This Asian Bistro offers something different than what most of the other Asian Bistros offer in this immediate area offer. This Asian Bistro actually offers TASTY Flavorful Food and isn't the "Old White People from Sun City BLAND style" that most nearby places offer.  The menu is sort of Pan Asian and besides Japanese Food they offer Korean Style Foods and Other Asian Style Food like Pad Thai. The prices are reasonable and some of the portions are very large.  We started with a Hamachi Kama (Grilled Yellowtail Collar $7.45) The portion was gigantic. We shared some and have enough leftover for TWO lunches. The fish seemed fresh and was good.  I had the dish called Korean Spicy with Chicken. It was a stir fry made with egg white noodles, vegetables, chicken in a flavorful, easy to handle spicy sauce. I thought it was very tasty but I can go for more heat. It was maybe LESS than a 5 out of ten on the Thai Scale for spicy heat.  My husband had the Yakiniku. It was a very similar beef stir fry dish but was served with rice instead of noodles. It tasted very similar but the beef was a little chewy.  Tasty FLAVORFUL Asian Food with a little heat in the area WOOHOO!

Eastwind Sushi is somewhat Pan-Asian Cuisine. Prices are very reasonable and all the  food I tried so far was tasty.  This time we tried a spicy tuna roll to start with. I will say the tuna was cleaner tasting than what you can get from NOT ALL but several near by sushi places. The sushi menu had mostly rolls with cream cheese or rolls that were deep fried so I had a salad for dinner.  I had the Spicy Thai Style Beef Salad. My salad was big and tasty. It didn't remind me of Thai Food but it tasted good and the beef was tender. I thought it was a pretty good salad and I think it ran about $7.99?  My husband had the Korean Style Hot and Spicy with Beef. The food seemed fresh and was flavorful.   For me this is more of a stir fry place or salad place and your opinion may differ.  I thought they were deserving of 4 stars because of the clean tasting tuna, low prices and everything I tried so far tasted good.

THE BEST ICE CREAM ON THE WEST SIDE and one of the BEST in the Valley!  Real home made ice cream made with quality ingredients by someone that actually knows how to make delicious ice cream and didn't just open an ice cream shop.   A review is necessary for this ice cream shop because of the location as it's on the west side but ONLY 10 MINUTES Past Peoria Sports Complex or at most 15 minutes past Arrowhead Mall.  Located in a mostly unoccupied strip mall.  NO SIGN I almost didn't spot this place....(hint) you need to look at the window.  It was very hard to decide on a flavor because it seemed like around 30 to choose from but went with the thin mint. It was rich and creamy and obviously made with quality chocolate and the right amount of chocolate. It really tasted just like a thin mint cookie. My husband had two scoops and had regular chocolate and a caramel flavor and those were also great.  They also have a nicely furnished dinning room with comfortable booths and complimentary water.  You should read the story about this family owned business on the Mighty Moo Website and then plan a trip to have some GREAT Ice Cream!

I love the Whimsy Modern Airy Atmosphere. When you walk in and you get the feeling you are one of those beautiful people in a movie that's in a really cool place somewhere. Oh But Yes you are it's Scottsdale AZ !  Asian and Latin Faces are sprinkled on some of the seats and a big really Real Looking tree is planted in the dining room. The Beautiful Restaurant was also pristine clean like a hospital.  Our waiter was very welcoming and explained the menu to us. The food is Asian Mexican Fusion and is TAPAS Style meaning you share small plates and do need to order 2 - 3 plates a person even at lunch time.  We started with the Korean Beef Tacos and the Miso Eggplant. Both were delicious and oh so delicate I think someone must have very good eye sight and used tweezers to add all the tiny delicate flowers and micro veggies in the right places on both these dishes. The Eggplant is a must get dish, it's creamy eggplant flesh that's slightly sweet and laced with miso and sake and also  adorned with sesame seeds. I would say the same about the Tacos  that are just as delicate and are also highly detailed and ARE DELICIOUS. But I do think they should up the price a few dollars and give you more tacos because my photo doesn't show you how small they really are. They are smaller than street tacos and you only get two to share. They were delicious and delicate but they were only a very small taste as they are only two bites at the most.  We also shared the Crispy Chicken Mole, another must get dish. Like everything else the presentation of the food was EXQUISITE! The dish was made with really moist delicious Chicken and Sweet Plantains and pickled red onions to cut the richness of the mole. It wasn't big on crisp but was really oh so delicious and I sure wouldn't mind getting it again.  For lunch this was more of a splurge but this is the kind of place when you want something special and different. I thought dinner prices were reasonable as they didn't differ so much from lunch.  I don't know if everything on the menu is as delicious as what I tried but sure will come back again to find out!  The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars are the tacos as interesting and delicious as they were. They were smaller than street tacos and you only got two for $7.00. For me I think either the tacos should become slightly bigger or they should up the price a few dollars and give you four tacos to share.  I note everything else I tried seemed in line with what it should cost.  Service was very welcoming and very efficient.   I can't wait to try this place out for dinner!  4.5 Stars

Even if you don't own a restaurant Great Deals can be found!  How about paying 29.5 CENTS@ For Red Bell Peppers! (Bags of 6 for $1.77)  How about getting close to 5 Lbs. of Parsnips for $2.25  Butternut Squash is only pennies a lb. It was only $1.something for two really big butternut squashes.  I saw some whole pigs.  I saw low priced meat items I'll try next time.   1lb. 1oz. Canola Cooking spray for $2.54  Small boxes of frozen Wild Caught Fish of different varieties.  LOTS OF STUFF more stuff than you need.  Glassware, Plates, all kinds of containers, gadgets, knives, and restaurant equipment. One of the flat top grills I saw sure would be nice to have.   Some prices were very low and some were the same as anyplace.  You need a free membership card to shop.  Also it will be helpful to bring a sweater with you as it gets mighty cold real fast when your walking around the produce, meats and cheeses.

The gravy train is no more.............  With a heavy heart I have to say I noticed some big changes over the past few months.  That's not to say that some true bargains can be found like the brisket that only cost me around $2.60 a pound and some other things that I like.   One of the big changes is that they used to sell chicken from a farm and now it's just chicken from a distributor. The price is up from $14-$18 and the quality is not the same. For example the chicken quarters used to be big and meaty and three quarters fit in a gallon ziplock bag. The chicken quarters that they sell now cost more and are so tiny and thin that NINE fit in a bag and some of them don't even have thighs attached. Each quarter only has about 2 ounces of meat.  I've never seen chicken quarters that small and they also have little flavor with pale flesh. I think I might throw them out because they are hardly worth the work.   Other changes that I noticed are in the produce department.  Prices have gone up and some of the quality has gone down.   On my last visit I saw very small and not very fresh cauliflower for $7. something a head. (honestly thought if must be a mistake)   On my most recent visit I saw 2 bunches of celery for about $8.00 and the red bell peppers were also very small and shriveled and not a bargain.  We called the store about the chicken and spoke to the meat guy. He said that I'm not the first to complain about the chicken but that is what they sell now.   I don't want anyone to be mislead by my last review so I felt I must make an update.   It's still worth the trip for some things but it's not a gravy train anymore.

The Cuff is a small but interesting Restaurant in Historic Glendale. They offer American Comfort Foods and Hand Crafted Cocktails in an Old Charm Atmosphere.   We sat on the comfortable but small outdoor patio that grows some of the fresh herbs used for dinners.  The Cuff's Cocktail menu is very above average. One drink had some sort of Artichoke liquor in it. I went with a Moscow Mule with fig infused vodka. It was tasty and strong and worth the $8 happy hour price.   We shared a few appetizers, the deviled eggs ($6.) and the Mixed baby lettuce salad. ($7.) Both were presented nicely and both tasted good.  For Dinner I had the Amalfi Chicken. ($11.)The chicken tasted fresh and was moist and came in a lemony fresh herbed broth with a whole grain bread for dipping and fresh broccolini.   My husband tried the smoked brisket platter.($12.) That came with fries and a very tasty coleslaw. I tasted a small piece of the brisket and I have to say that brisket was outstanding and I BET is the BEST Brisket you can get in Glendale! It came in two pieces on the platter and my husband said one piece was fattier than the other. but they had these delicious caramelized ends. The brisket was very developed with flavor and was really VERY very good!  Very Good Food!  Interesting well crafted Drinks!  Low Prices!  Old Town Glendale  has a new destination restaurant!

EVERYTHING WE HAD WAS DELICIOUS and we tried a lot!  This Lebanese Grill offers a platter or feast for two that cost $21.99  We got started with two generous fresh crisp salads that were lightly dressed with tasty flavorful dressing.  Soon our humungous platter arrives to us. We got....  one juicy tasty Chicken kabab one shish kaita (lamb & beef) one chicken kaita one tenderloin kabab Three house made tasty sauces two crispy falafels two stuffed grape leaves fluffy rice and flat bread  The kaitas had this delicious char on the exterior and the centers were seasoned with delicious herbs. they also were mouth watering juicy. The falafels had crisp exteriors and also were filled with delicious herbs. Everything was seasoned just so and everything was prepared well.  Service was friendly and welcoming. The dining room was comfortable and appeared clean.  Found a new favorite for my rotation!

FINALLY A DECENT VERY GOOD Restaurant has come to this part of town!   After only one visit The Dash Grill is a part of my local rotation.  This is a small casual restaurant where you order at the counter pick up a number and seat yourself. I ordered the Seared Tuna Sandwich and picked the fresh herbed vegetables as my side. I soon receive a very well presented platter. The Tuna tasted fresh and has a tasty kale slaw and was brushed with a not too spicy but sweet marmalade on a very fresh Brioche Bun. The fresh Julienne Vegetables were just delicious.  My husband had the New Yorker that's a Grilled Corned Beef Sandwich. He asked for the slaw on the side. He also received a nicely presented and prepared platter. The sandwich was on good grilled bread and the generous pile of corned beef was tasty and cooked in house. His side of macaroni and cheese was really good and you could taste real cheese there.  Some how we managed to save room for dessert and shared a Lemon Tart. The dessert was well presented, tasted good and was a nice treat to share.  Sandwiches are priced $9-$14 and come with a side dish. They might cost you a buck or two more than other places but you are getting higher quality food here. They also offer small plates, Dinners, and do have a children's menu.  I didn't notice alcohol being served here.  Service was very friendly and efficient.  Very VERY Good! Very SOLID 4+ Stars!  The Best Restaurant that has come to this area in a LONG TIME!  I'm so happy they opened here!

I believe the correct name for this restaurant is Suh Noi - The Little Thaiger. This is a small super casual Thai restaurant with a drive-thur window. The menu is small compared to other Thai places but they also serve some unique foods too. You order at the register and seat yourself.   Based on what we had they are deserving of at least 4 stars as the food really was very good.  In both dishes we tried the meats were cooked nicely and the dishes actually had enough basil.   I had the Holy Basil Chicken. The chicken was tender and this dish had enough basil to make it taste good. This dish ran much hotter than I was expecting and I almost couldn't eat it. I ordered it very hot. About 1/2 of other Thai places don't make very hot that hot and I'm usually left wanting more heat but NOT THIS TIME. I'm not the biggest fan of jalapeños in Thai Food but it's such a big deal to find a place that uses Holy Basil I got it anyway.   My husband had a similar dish the Wild Boar Grapao. This dish is made more the way I like. The meat was hand chopped in a similar but slightly different sauce with Thai Basil and Thai Chili's. The very hot in this dish was mild compared to the Holy Basil Chicken but was spicy. For $1.50 extra you have the option to have your dish Thai Style with a fried egg.  Very good and above average for sure.

For most of us this is just a Gallery and Not a Store to shop at. The store is adorned with the largest several Ton Crystal found. (but was under protected covering)   Not just another Rock Shop it more like the very best of the Tuscan Gem Show. You will see Large Breath Taking Dazzling Gems that you can't afford. Dazzling tables with bases of gems. Some beautiful artwork. Art Glass.  I saw the most beautiful slabs of stones inlayed with gems to be cut for either custom tables or counter tops that cost around $450.00 - $950.00 a FOOT. These are the people that also install those beautiful thin stone walls that light up like what you see in some of the fine places like in Las Vegas.   They also sell a small amount of tourist jewelry.  For me this place is a Gallery.  If I hit the lottery I will shop here.  This was my favorite stop in Cave Creek.

I glad that I decided to give Naked BBQ another try because they improved a lot since my last visit. I did want to try the brisket because that is how I usually judge BBQ but they were out of brisket so I tried the turkey. THE TURKEY WAS REALLY AWSOME! It's really hard to flavor a turkey breast just right and keep it moist. The turkey had many flavors going on with it and was smoked just right. It was delicious!  Just like last last time my husband really enjoyed the pulled pork he said it was very good.  I thought the pickles and corn muffin were really tasty. (didn't need the hot bbq sauce but it was also very tasty)  The coleslaw was very improved. It was fresh tasting, a little sweet and pretty drip free.  The fresh vegetable was mushy but it was nice that a healthy choice was offered.  The owner checked on everyone in the restaurant and made sure everyone was happy.  This is one of the best BBQs on this side of town!

Fired Pie is a fast/casual sort of build your own salad or pizza kind of place that also features a suggested menu in case you don't feel like making decisions.   I've been to another one of the eight Fired Pie locations and had the pizza before and do prefer the salads from Fired Pie over the pizzas but that is just my preference and not necessarily yours.  I picked the Field Greens with Roasted Vegetables Salad. I soon received a nice big fresh salad with lots of vegetables. I particularly liked the roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes in my salad, they were cold but still tasty.  My husband had the Steak and Blue Salad. He said it was pretty good but would have liked it better if they warmed up the meat in his salad. Oddly a meatball was found in his salad. Well I guess it was a free bonus like a prize in Cracker Jack because he ate it and we weren't charged extra for the cold meatball.  This place is brand new and the people working there have to read instructions on how to make the salads so bear with them.  At the time of this review 10-26-14 There is nothing better to eat at Tanger Outlets unless you want to eat the sandwiches next door from that popular chain that carries spongy chicken and soft fluffy fresh baked YOGA MAT bread.  So you have to grab your bite at Fired Pie.  3.5 Stars

This is a small casual restaurant with only a few tables inside and a bigger patio outside. You come here for Asian Inspired Fried Chicken made with organic red bird chicken and really great donuts. You place your order at the counter and first decide on what size and flavor chicken you want, then decide on your Asian Inspired side and lastly your donut. Some donuts are a $1.00 uncharge. You then seat yourself and wait for to hear your number called. A special was offered the day I was there and they were offering ramen in addition to the menu.  I went with the two piece Korean Chili Chicken with tom yum slaw and a key lime donut. The chicken had a nice crisp skin and the interior was juicy. I thought the sauce was tasty. It didn't have that caramel shattering crisp thing I like in Korean Fried Chicken but there is no denying this chicken still was tasty. The slaw was very unusual to me but sort of tasty. I thought the donut was cooked nicely. It was light and puffy and seemed oil free. The Key Lime Donut was really delicious with lots of flavors and textures. I just wish my donut had a little more of the delicious filling as mine was very scant with the filling.  The people working there were helpful and very concerned about how everything was.  Tasty fried chicken and a fun donut is a treat!

Undecided between four and five stars.    The food tasted great and the portions were more than double of what I was expecting since pricing seemed so low. (most of what we got was $5.@)  Service was friendly and helpful.   This is a small family run casual bistro that specializes in Banh Mi Sandwiches and MORE. You order at the counter and seat yourself.  I ordered a grilled chicken banh mi and a lotus root salad. They were only $5. @ so I thought they'd be very tiny and not very filling. WOW was I wrong! My sandwich was GIANT SIZE but was very delicious. I loved the pickled carrot/radish salad in it and the sauces they used. The chicken was very tasty too. The jalapeño added a fun burn to the sandwich. The sandwich was very tasty and more than twice as big as I was expecting.   The lotus root salad was fresh and delicious. (also a larger portion than I was expecting) I never seen lotus root that looked like that. They were fresher than what I've seen before and looked like baby lotus roots to me.  My husband enjoyed his pulled pork banh mi and ate the whole thing.  We shared the fire cracker salmon roll. Due to our American Taste this one wasn't a winner to me or my husband. I'm not saying it was bad but the kind of seaweed wrapped around the salmon added a fishy taste that made the salmon taste fishy instead of sweet like it really was.   The fire cracker salmon roll came with a generous portion of cabbage slaw. You have to really love seaweed with fish to love these rolls.  I took a bunch of food home and feel I got far more than what I paid for.   This place is a winner and a new favorite for my rotation.  I can't wait to try other items.  A solid 4.5 Stars

The majority of the menu is priced at $5.00 each, portions are large and the majority of the food is delicious. This is a small family ran casual business that specializes in the Banh Mi sandwich and more. You order up at the counter and seat yourself.   On my last visit I enjoyed the fresh crisp lotus root salad and the chicken banh mi. The chicken banh mi sandwich was really delicious and packed with tasty crisp vegetables. Portions were much larger than I was expecting and I took half home for latter.  This time we shared some vegetable egg rolls. They were different and unlike any other egg roll I ever had. You get lettuce leaves, fresh herbs cucumber and radish carrot salad to wrap around the egg rolls and then you dip them in a light fish sauce. They were the most interesting and the most delicious egg rolls I ever had.  For my meal I had the chicken and tofu vegetable bun. The bun is a salad made with lots of noodles. You have a choice of two toppings for your bun. The chicken was nicely seasoned but was very dry in my salad. I actually liked the tofu very much. It was marinated and flavorful. The way they prepared the tofu you could mistake it for moist chicken in this salad.   My husband had the classic banh mi this time. He liked it and wants to eat his way threw all the banh mi's on the menu. He is very interested in the meatball banh mi.  I like that this place offers something very different and unique to this area.  A solid good place to eat!  I do recommend to call in advance for opening hours if you're traveling to visit Banh Mi Bistro because they do occasionally close for special events as they did last Saturday.

ALL ABOARD! THE MARRAKECH Express has arrived in Phoenix!  HIDDEN GEM ALERT!  This is a tiny but exotic Moraccon Restaurant with only four inside tables and four big bench tables outside. Much of the food they serve are slow braised meats that mostly come with couscous. It's like what your grandmother would prepare for you if she was Moroccan. The male owner was just like my grandmother. I kept telling him I was full but he kept bringing us more food. Pricing is very low and portions are very large. (currently they offer a $5.99 lunch special)  We entered not knowing what we'd order and then the owner introduces himself and makes light conversation with us. He tells us to sit down and he said he'd just bring food to us to try.   We started with Date Shakes, Moroccan Mint Tea, House made Lemon Cured Olives, Fresh Baked Bread and Moroccan Carrots. It was all good and it was all fresh!  Next came a soup. It was thickened with Garbanzo Beans and had noodles. This was a goat based soup.  A BIG generous dishes of slow braised fall off the bone tender, beef ribs, and lamb arrive, a dish of stewed potatoes followed by a plate of tender flavorful dark quarters of chicken on a platter with more couscous and an assortment of vegetables.  We also tried tasting style chicken bastilla. That's a puff pastry stuffed with their really good and tasty chicken, cinnamon and powdered sugar.   What a FEAST!  And it ended with house made Moroccan Desserts!  Pricing was very low and potions were very large.  A current grade "A" Maricopa inspection is posted.  The Restaurant Front is Rough but it's a Gem inside.  Parking might be difficult. (I parked next door)  Get your Couscous on at Couscous Express!  call them for their hours of operation  Hours at this time are M-F 10:30-5 and Saturday 11:00-4

This is a casual eatery were you order at the counter and seat yourself. At the time of this review they are only open for lunch Monday threw Friday. Noble Eatery is the restaurant side of Noble Bread. Many of the best Restaurants in the Metro Phoenix area feature Noble Bread. The menu changes daily.  On my visit they offered a house made soup, a couple produce sides, sandwiches made with the signature thin crusty bread pocket and Smorgas.  I saw that smorgas were open faced but didn't know what they were and ordered a tuna smorgas. It was three big chunks of Crusty Noble Bread topped with a mixture of tuna, EVOO, and spelt. It was suppose to also include Home Boy Jalapeño Hot Sauce. They used a very small amount of the sauce because I didn't taste anything jalapeño there. The Bread was excellent but the tuna was just ok to me. I would order a sandwich next time.  The grapefruit and strawberries with wild fennel seeds was very light and refreshing but was very light with the fennel seeds because I didn't get them in many of the bites.  My husband really enjoyed the #2 Fra Mani Sandwich and the canary lentil soup with poblano chilies, farro and kale was good but also was very light with the poblanos because neither of us found them in the soup.  3.5 stars   3-5 stars depending on what you try.  Parking might be tight and the tables are small and some are very close together.

Local craft beers and masterfully prepared hand crafted food items. Many meats are skillfully prepared in house like the house made mortadella, house made andouille sausage, house made cured and smoked salmon that they call lox. The atmosphere is light and airy but also very casual and industrial.  Many interesting items are on the menu and it is very hard to decide on what to order.  The walleye pike was calling my name but I went with the house cured smoked salmon that they call lox salad. It was very detailed and was more like a deconstructed bagel sandwich. The fish was slightly smokey, buttery and accented with goat cheese, crispy capers, other vegetables, dill croutons and a clever "everything vinaigrette" was carefully thought out. Every bite was interesting. This was a great salad and it did have enough protein with the cheese and egg but I thought it needed a little more fish than the maybe one ounce I received.  We shared a side of roasted cauliflower. The cauliflower was roasted till nutty and was terrific with the almonds and carefully lightly smoked tomato. It tasted great and went together really well.  My husband also had a difficult time deciding and ordered the house made andouille sausages but begged the waitress to sell him a slice of house made mortadella. He said the mortadella was really great and would have been happy with it and also really enjoyed the house made andouille sausages. He said they were so good with the grits and shrimp gravy.  Everything including service was great.  I managed to save some room for dessert. They offer Sweet Republic Ice Creams and two house made desserts. I went with the Texas tea stout chocolate cake. The cake it's self was moist chocolatey and laced with stout. Topped with a fresh tasting cream hazelnuts and chocolate shavings. It was all good together. I didn't get the Bailey's too much because the other flavors in the cake were stronger but it was good and we didn't have any trouble polishing it down.  Very good detailed food.  I'll probably get hooked with the walleye next time!

This restaurant offers local craft beer, in-house prepared meats, farmer fresh dishes and hardier chef crafted fair. The atmosphere is roomy and comfortable and service was friendly and efficient on my last two visits.  We started sharing a half order of the three cheddar, two ale cheese and mac with truffled parm crust. No denying this dish was tasty and layered with flavors and texture due to the delicate tasty crust bursting with truffle essence.  I came back to try the wild walleye in beer batter. It came with a very tasty fresh slaw that was heavy with celery seeds and other flavors. Nicely seasoned tarter sauce and a MOUNTAIN of hand cut fries. I got a very generous amount of meaty mild fresh tasting fish in a beer laced batter. I thought all the flavors were delicious but I think the batter was slightly off being donut like in texture and that's the reason I'm lowing the 5 stars to 4 stars because the batter was still good but not perfect. I looked at photos from other people's walleye and I do see I didn't get what they got. I do note that I feel that this is a very good restaurant to eat at and on my visit possibly due to someone new cooking or a slight slip in the recipe I got something less than what they normally serve.  I was absolutely blown away with what I ordered last time and hope to bring them back up to five stars next time.

This is a newly opened stylish family ran Brazilian Restaurant with a beautiful patio that sits by a running water feature with plantings.  They start everyone off with crispy plantain chips.  We started off with Pao de Queijo that are basically baked fresh to order chewy cheese puffs that are gluten free. They take 12 minutes to bake and came out piping hot and tasty.   I had the cold chicken salad called Salpicao de Frango. I never had a chicken salad like this before. The chicken salad with studded with corn, peas, apples and raisins and topped with matchstick crispy potato chips that sat over fresh romaine. Somehow it was very refreshing and sort of seemed tropical to me.  My husband had the Feijoada that is a variety of meat and sausage in a black bean stew with rice and collard greens and condiments. He liked it very much and said he'd order it again the next time.  I thought the food we had was very good and the service was friendly and efficient.  ********4.5 Stars******

Oh-OH-Spaghetti Rolls! (like garlic knots, spaghetti and pizza had a baby) ($4.95)  Oh my... Stuffed pizzas... big enough to feed godzilla packed with goodness ($4.95)  Drum Roll..........................  The above were all great .....but both of us enjoyed the white pizza slice the most!  The Bianco Neve was unlike any white pizza I ever had before due to the really magical smooth wonderful ricotta cheese on it kissed with olive oil and the right amount of garlic and mozzarella. I did add a little salt, pepper and a few pepper flakes to it to suit me and it was really special.  The Low Downs-  The plain slice of pizza was just ok and nothing special. Not bad but nothing special and seemed very average against everything else we tried.  This place is very small and already a HIT and ALREADY VERY POPULAR!  At the time of my visit they only had 5 tables (they do have room to add more) so many people weren't able to get a table.  They don't have real silverware and you have to dine with plastic silverware. Normally that isn't a big deal but it's difficult to eat the the stuffed pizza with plastic silverware.  Prices are low and portions are off the charts! (we took a bunch home)  Destination Pizza across the street from the Anthem Outlet Mall!  Absolutely worth a Fork!

You wait in a single line that is covered and INFESTED WITH PIGEONS POOPING and cooing over your head. It STINKS and bird poop is everywhere.  Then you enter and think every things OK.  The theater is old and very stained, dirty and STINKS from filth and the chairs don't rock either.  My husband thought he was hungry and tried a soft pretzel from the concession stand. I took a bite, It was covered in FAKE Butter and the pretzel was like bread Styrofoam. It's a throw out.  I am NEVER seeing a movie here again everything about this place stinks.  I need my real camera to photo the pigeon infestation.

Fresh Box is a fast/casual High End salad, wrap, smoothie and juice place. Ingredients here are locally sourced and organic. High end oils are used like avocado oil and high end sweeteners are used like coconut sugar.   You have your choice of building a salad yourself or picking an already thought out salad from the menu so I went with the sumac daddy salad because that sounded different and unique. My salad was made with FREE RANGE sumac coated tender fresh chicken, turmeric coated cauliflower, other fresh vegetables, quinoa and a better quality feta cheese that was creamy and not too salty. The Tahini cucumber dressing that came with it was interesting. The salad was very large but satisfying and filling but not in a heavy way.  My husband built his own salad with grass fed steak. The steak was fresh tender and flavorful. He also picked a bunch of other items including pickled onions that were tasty. We both thought his cilantro dressing was very good.  The people working there were friendly and helpful and the salads were prepared quickly. The dining area was attractive and seemed clean.

Where you ever so disappointed with a meal you felt like eating again?  My husband was so disappointed from the food from another food truck he thought he had to eat again. (we had lots of leftovers we just left) He decided an Italian Press Sandwich would be better.  He ordered the sandwich that came with one side so he picked crispy potatoes with gorgonzola sauce. (that sounds good doesn't it?)  The sandwich was very dry and seemed to lack the pepper pesto it was suppose to have. Some of the potatoes were really delicious with fresh herbs and light drizzle of gorgonzola sauce but the rest of the potatoes were burnt tasting and without sauce.  meh

Nice American looking restaurant with an airy patio. The menu is mostly American Comfort food.   I had the crispy grouper sandwich with spaghetti squash as my side. The grouper seemed as fresh as can be and was so moist and mild it just melted in my mouth. I did find it impossible to eat as a sandwich because the bun is too large so I ate it open faced with half the bun. The house made slaw and pickles were very tasty and cut the richness of the buttery rich bun and fried fish. For me I thought the spaghetti squash was too rich with butter, cream and cheese but my husband thought it was very good. The sandwich did cost $14.00 but I thought that was a very fair price for grouper since grouper runs about $22.00 a pound.  My husband had the cavatelli carbonara with the $1.00 add on sunny egg. He thought it was excellent but thought it was a small portion and should have came with a little bread or a small salad or should have been just a little bigger.  Our waiter highly recommended the monkey bread for dessert and said it was his favorite. The pies at the sister restaurant Grass Roots are outstanding so I thought dessert from here would have to be too. Honestly the dessert was tasty and reminded me of sticky buns but it was a lot of bread and can feed 4-6 people.  Service was friendly and efficient.  3.75 stars

The Adobo Dragon is a small food service counter located in the Desoto Central Market. They serve up a limited menu that's sort of Asian and Latino Inspired.   We decide to share a Bao Combination Platter of a Chicken Bao and a Fish Bao. The Platter comes with a fresh salad. We share the Fish First. It sounded the most interesting with guava chili jam and wasabi huancana. The bun was fresh, hot and steamy. I thought that this would be good. But then all I tasted was fish and not in a good way. I didn't think it was spoiled. It just was like fish from Safeway. Not spoiled but off tasting. The sauces didn't mask the fish taste. I don't recommend getting the fish bao here.  Then we split the Chicken Bao. This was more sweet than anything but the chicken in it was sort of dry and lacked flavor.   The salad was the best part of the plate. I enjoyed it.  The girl at the counter was pleasant and ran our food to us.

The SECRET is OUT!   Toscana has just opened and now Glendale has Fine North Italian Dining. Toscana shares the same front door as Pomo Pizzeria but has it's own well trained staff, their own bar and separate more formal dining area.   They start you off with crusty bread and olive oil that's studded with dots of balsamic vinegar. We shared a plate of house made gnocchi that was adorned with walnuts and gorgonzola cheese in a light cream. The gnocchi with light and airy and the walnuts were fresh and not bitter. The flavors went together well. For dinner I had the  pistachio crusted salmon. My fish seemed fresh and was prepared well, it was nice and moist. My broccoli was crisp and tasted like it was brushed with olive oil and seasoned just so. Grilled polenta also came with my dish.   My husband had the pollo ripieno. It was a stuffed chicken with prosciutto and fontina cheese in a white wine sauce with sweet corn. The chicken was melt in your mouth tender and that dish was delicious.   Prices were reasonable. Atmosphere was on the loud side and energetic. Glendale has a new destination dining spot! People from Scottsdale might travel to dine here!

This is a small fast/casual middle east style eatery with very stylish decor. You order at the counter and seat yourself.   I had the barberry rice and chicken. The white meat chicken was juicy and I liked the char taste on the chicken. The long grain rice was very fluffy and was studded with very tart barberries. The barberries were interesting I never had them before. The portion of the entrees are very large and they do give you a large portion of meat. You also get a pat of butter with the rice and sumac is on the table.   We also shared the falafel appetizer. The falafels are very large and are not the crispy kind and are more of a meatball texture and are tasty.  The girl at the counter was friendly and helpful.  This restaurant is located across the street in that big shopping center from the Whole Foods on Mayo Blvd.

Undecided between 4 and 5 stars and need another visit to decide.  Beautiful decor that lacks Corduroy and very professional service.   Corduroy is a Spanish Global Style Tapas House sort of.    Everything we had was DELICIOUS!  We shared some crispy cauliflower. It came with a lemony aioli. We also shared the Corduroy Salad and the Chicken Piri Piri. The salad and the piri piri were really very good. The salad was very detailed with about 13 ingredients and was dressed with preserved lemon champagne dressing. It was an adventure of taste and textures. The piri piri was made with seared moist flavorful white meat chicken in a spicy but not TOO spicy tabasco sauce and was served over citrus rice and was just delicious.  This place just opened last week and they are still tinkering with the menu.  Corduroy isn't in the decor and isn't worn by the servers.  Not your cheapest eats but also not the most expensive either.   Very very good could be a new favorite!  4.5 stars

Short Story-   Very Good Food in a Comfortable Attractive Atmosphere served by untrained servers. Based on one visit. At least my server was very inexperienced serving tables and knew nothing about the food.  More detailed longer story-  I arrived five minutes before the restaurant opened and the parking lot only had two parking spots open. As I strolled to the restaurant I noticed a small coffee building and lots of attractive outdoor seating with an outside bar. I also noticed the restaurant wasn't full of guest yet so I wondered why the lot was full.  The restaurant is sleek, modern, light and airy with comfortable seating. The menu is modern with international accents. They feature hot and cold not - so - small, small plates and larger plates that feature many chicken dishes. The plates are meant to be shared so a couple might want to share up to three plates. The wine menu is written for wine dummies and has symbols so a ten year old can understand each bottle of wine.  The restaurant wasn't full yet but the hostess sat us at a table that they were using as a bus stand filled with many used wine glasses. She pulled the table apart so goody-goody we could sit on the clean end. The pulled table left very little room between tables.  We informed out server that we were sharing the plates we ordered but she didn't space them them out and served all three plates at once barely fitting them on the small deuce of a table. We told her to bring one plate back so we'd have a little room.  We started with the Spinach Salad. The detailed fresh salad sat on top of silky buttery smoked salmon. It was a very perfect balanced salad and was very good.   Next was the Japanese Fish and Chips. I asked what kind of fish was used. A trained server would know what kind of fish was used. A GOOD server would say something like, "I don't know but I'll find out." Our server said, " I think..Japanese Fish. I was eventually told after asking three more times that the fish used was cod (or at least that was what I was told). It was mild sweet moist and meaty and prepared to perfection. The fish was so good I would not have recognized it as cod. The fries might have been the weakest of what I tried as they were tasty but sort of dry and not crispy. They also didn't come with a dipping sauce so they were easy to push aside.  The Thai Style Roasted Chicken was developed with flavor and was very juicy and moist. Perhaps from sitting the skin was soggy and not edible to me but the sauce over it was absolutely delicious. Based on this one visit it's a good bet that any chicken dish will be delicious but might have soggy skin.  When we finished the plate instead of our server saying something like we have many delicious desserts or something like can I get you anything else?........The server said, Do you want anything else?  I do note this is a newly opened restaurant that serves up delicious food. Service based on my visit isn't on the same level as the food.  Some growing pains but a wonderful menu with very good food in an attractive atmosphere.  Slight Update- 11-28-15 Service has improved and the food is still delicious! This is a wonderful Restaurant!  4.5 Stars

Twenty Flavors of Thirty Ice Cream, pickles and lots of water. Eight inside water filling stations. Interior design center for all your home remodeling. We had single scoops of blueberry cheesecake and chocolate malt ball. ($1.70 or $4.00 a whole cup) The ice cream was good and I looked at lots of interesting tiles, fixtures and flooring. I think it's GREAT that this unique store opened! The Poseidon Filtration Systems Store, Thrifty Ice Cream and D&K Kitchen are sort of all connected but are also separate businesses. Thrifty Ice Cream is a bare bones kind of ice cream shop. No tables but you are welcome to sit at the counter at D&K Kitchen. The four stars is a stretch but hey they are the only ice cream shop in the area and I'm happy it's not yogurt.

"GEM ALERT"  This is NOT your average Mexican Restaurant they have something different to offer.  This IS casual authentic style "Mexican City Mexico" style food.  This is NOT a fancy place. You are only here for the food.  The specialty of the house might be the namesake dish called the Machete. The Machete is a house made corn tortilla that is SO LARGE it doesn't fit on a plate and is served on a PLATTER. The humungous tortilla comes in about a dozen varieties and comes stuffed with a thick blanket of mild melted cheese and arrives folded. Some of the varieties are seldom offered at most Mexican Restaurants in the valley like the squash blossoms and the huitacoche (Mexican Truffle also called Corn Smut that is considered a delicacy)  I had the Huitacoche Machete. At the time of this review it was only $7.99 so I didn't think it would be that large but it was enough to feed 2-3 people and I had to take half home after sharing some. It was very tasty, very good and generously filled. The Huitacoche was a more sweet, more textured kind less earthy kind than I ate in Mexico. It was mixed with sweet corn and was very interesting.   I also had a Chicken Taco ($1.75) I knew it would be street sized because of the price. I liked that the house made double tortillas were hot and steamy and tasted just like the fresh ones from the tortilla factory in Mexico. The taco differed in flavor from a Jalisco Style Taco. It was a much milder tasting taco.  Three sauces were offered to most people in the restaurant with the dishes but due to how busy they were we only got to try one sauce that had a little kick to it and it helped the taco out.  My husband had the Huaraches with Chorizo. It was a giant platter that looked similar in size to the Machete but served open face and also came with lots of melty mild cheese.  I warn you that the menu is written in Spanish but it's pretty easy to figure out what is what because of the pictures on the menu.  On out visit the atmosphere was extremely loud. Mexican Music is blaring outside the building and inside is Mexican Television blaring and you hear both at the same time.  On our visit they were very busy with non stop take out orders and every booth was filled with customers. Considering how busy they were I thought the service was very efficient and friendlier than I was expecting.  This place should be on your bucket list if you like interesting food.  I recommend ordering a Machete or a Huarache.  Parking is easy they have their own large lot.

If you want the best pastrami, the best nova lox, the best Italian meat sandwich, the best fries  in all the land in a LOUD but casual environment that's hard to park at this is it!  The house made wagu pastrami is to die for. It flavorful and succulent it's like no other you'll find anywhere else.  The Italian Stallion is made up with the best Italian meats that you can't find anywhere else like finocchiona.  Fries were triple fried and have a shattering crisp outside and a fluffy moist  interior.  I took out a nova lox bagel to have for the next day. I read from the Phoenix New Times that the nova is from Russ and Daughters and is the best nova in the country and the bagel is from New York too. The Nova lox is truly the very best nova around as it's very silky in texture with a light briney taste like no other.   I can overlook the insanely loud music after all I do remember what college eateries are like. But it was so loud the cashier couldn't hear my very loud husband ordering. We also couldn't talk to each other because it was so loud. I can also overlook the parking after all I knew where I was going.  I can't give five stars because of the take out $14.00 Lox and Bagel. I got 1.9 oz of the best hand cut nova lox and not enough cream cheese to make it to the ends of the bagel. Anybody that sells a bagel and cream cheese anywhere makes a nicer put together sandwich and not one like I got. I also prefer regular capers over the cocktail capers as they don't taste the same.  This is a newly opened restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch. This restaurant is still working the bugs out.  THE BEST INGREDIENTS in a casual, LOUD small restaurant with a patio.

TUNISIAN HAS FINALY HIT PHOENIX and TUNISAN FOOD IS DELICIOUS FOOD!  *******HIDDEN*******GEM********ALERT****************  This is a very small basic restaurant that isn't fancy and also has a very limited menu. They serve mostly just a few chicken, few lamb, few vegetarian dishes and tuna.  I ordered the Chicken Mechoui. It was seasoned moist chunks of chicken breast and came with fresh baked to order pita bread and this extremely delicious vegetable side called Slata Mechouiya. When I first tasted the vegetable side I thought it might be too spicy for me but somehow almost like magic the spiciness takes a bake seat and it just turns delicious.  My husband had the house made lamb sausage plate called Ajja Merguez. It was also very delicious and was garnished with eggs and was served with harissa and fresh made to order pita bread.  The owner gave me a Tunisian Chicken Tajine to sample. It differed very much from Moroccan Tajines (that you can get next door at the Moroccan Restaurant) The Tunisian Tajine is more like a casserole. It tasted like something your mom might make if she was Tunisian.  You won't go wrong with the Chicken Mechoul or the Ajja Merguez!   The food was more delicious than I can describe you must try it if you can.  The owners were friendly and welcoming.  Portions are large and prices are low.  This is a soon to be discovered Hidden Gem!  4.5 Stars

ALERT! ***********HIDDEN GEM********DISCOVERED!**************  This casual place has just opened and may be still in the tweaking stage but if you want the tastiest roast beef sandwich in town HERE IT IS!  The Signature Sandwich here is what they call a "Beef on Weck" that are normally only served in Buffalo N.Y. Technically it's not 100% truly a beef on weck due to a few small picky details but it's close enough for me and is one of the most delicious sandwiches in town. (beef on weck is hand sliced rare roast beef topped with horseradish and the bottom of the top weck bun is dipped in the au jus)   What makes this sandwich unique is the hard substantial roll that's topped with caraway seeds and kosher salt called a Kummel Weck Roll. They give you a BIG PILE of delicious great tasting roast beef, horseradish on the side and your sandwich is dripping with lots of tasty au jus. Your BIG MEATY Sandwich also comes with a side. We both had the delicious beef on weck sandwiches and shared the house made onion rings and the house made potato salad. Onion rings were ok and the eggy potato salad was very fresh tasting but a little on the bland side.  I dropped them a star for the wings. While they weren't bad at all they just were edible. They might be still tinkering with the wing recipe.  This is a casual eatery. You order at the counter, seat yourself and they run the food out to you.   They serve mostly just a few varieties of sandwiches. Beef on Weck, hamburgers, Buffalo made hot dogs, meatballs, local Peoria made sausage, coal cooked chicken, Italian sandwiches.  Portions are very large and prices are very low

This is a casual interactive Neapolitan Style Pizzeria. The dining room is modern and comfortable. It looks like they have a full bar too. Char offers a menu with suggested salads and pizzas or you have the option to build your own sort of "Subway Sandwich Style." The pizzas are made with 00 flour and are baked in 800 degree wood fired ovens. You seat yourself grab a number and they run your food to the table.  Ordering is somewhat difficult. You order in the middle of the pizza line and a bunch of teenagers try to take your order. I asked for the complimentary Calabrian Chiles to be added to my pizza and the teenagers look at me like Im a leper or something. Then someone from the other end runs a small container of oil with some chili to the teens. After you order the pizza you proceed threw the line to the cashier and you get a number, your drink and seat yourself.  I tried the Bianca pizza. The crust was thin and crisp with raw flour underneath and a very wide crust ends for it's size. One slice from my pizza was all crust and topping free. My pizza was suppose to have some ricotta cheese on it but I couldn't identify any on it because whatever cheese I had on my pizza was baked on so hard it was like a cheese crisp. The cheese wasn't melty and was baked on hard like a crouton.  This place uses better ingredients than other similar concept restaurants I've been too but comparing this Neapolitan style pizza to others Neapolitan pizzas I tried the two stars is accurate.

The Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva is a very small and very upscale Mexican Restaurant owned by a James Beard Award Nominated Chef.  At the time of this review this is a newly opened restaurant and my review is based on one lunch experience because I had difficulty making a dinner reservation. Reservations last week were difficult because I got the message that nothing at my dinner time was available for EIGHT weeks so I decided to try lunch instead and got in easily.  Tiny tiny restaurant upscale looking restaurant with up to eight tables unless they are pushed together.  The dining room is an unusual sort of triangle shape. The walls are adorned with AMAZING hand-painted artwork. You truly feel as if your sitting in a vestibule in an art museum. The room is filled with lots of natural light and you have lots of views of whimsical decorations outside everywhere you look.  The menu that was given to me on my visit was very dinner-like with dinner-like prices. Many of the ingredients on the menu I wasn't familiar with but my waiter was very helpful and answered any question I had.  We are already very familiar with the Chef's Famous Guacamole, Oochinita Pibil  and Chiles en Nogada so we wanted to try some different items.  We ordered and complimentary olives and bread arrives.  They started us out with fresh and unusual greens with a delicious slightly sweet and spicy dressing. Some of the greens were very unusual and there was a certain interesting herb in it that I wasn't familiar with that was absolutely delicious. The salad was powerful with bold flavors. We both really enjoyed this salad.  I picked the Tacuba. It was made of a special uniques tortillas, exotic cheeses, fresh spinach and more. I thought it was very tasty and interesting with the different waves of different sauces.  My husband had the Mole du Jour. It was white meat boneless matchstick cut chicken on our day that was served with a flavorful kind of rice. I'm not a mole expert but I can tell you the mole was deeper (sort of like coffee) and not as smooth as others I've tried before. The chicken seemed like good quality chicken and just had a natural chicken taste. The rice had a little tang and more.  With the current lunch menu this is only a once in a while or special occasion destination. Dinner certainly has the potential to be a five star event that I hope to try in the future.

This is a small but inviting restaurant with a tiny patio that offers craft beers and offers very limited food menus. This restaurant is located in a newer shopping center.   I note I haven't tried any of the beers yet and my review is only on food but if the food is an indication of how the beers taste my guess is that the beers must be pretty dam good.  I tried the Scottish Salmon. It was excellent and possibly might be the BEST salmon you can get in Peoria. It was seasoned to perfection and had that really perfect crisp skin and the flesh seemed slow cooked and just melted in my mouth. It was delicious. I'm not usually a fan of baby spinach but even the spinach was well thought out and danced with flavors. Fresh grilled pineapple and confit garlic accents adorned the plate and added balance. This was the best tasting healthiest lunch I had in a while. It was perfect for lunch but I do note if I had this plate for dinner I'd still be hungry since it was carb free.   My husband tried the French Dip. I tasted a small piece of beef and I can tell you that is was also well seasoned and very good. Even the fries were above average and very good.  Service was friendly and efficient.  If your in the area I'd highly recommend but I would take the time to check out the menu because it is very limited.  Very GOOD and a Gem of Peoria!

MIKE IS BACK! OPA!  The West Side has a NEW "GEM" in Town!  Mike is a well known Chef in this area and is well known for his Greek and Italian Cuisine.   This restaurant prepares well made food. Sauces and many meats prepared in house. The front of the menu says they are a Bakery too so possibly some of the breads might be prepared in house too.  I've been to his last restaurant many times and this new restaurant offers a bigger more varied  menu, wait staff, roomy comfortable booths.  I came in for lunch and ordered the Salmon Souvlaki Pita. The pita came with my choice of Greek Fries or Greek Salad so I went with Salad. Out comes a big fresh salad and soon after my pita arrives. The pita bread seemed like it was made to order as it was so fresh and hot and the filling was tasty. My husband had the house made sausage with peppers and onions. The sandwich was baked with bubbly mozzarella cheese.   We were checked on several times by our server and by Mike.  We will stop in for dinner next time as I remember the Myconos Chicken was pretty darn tasty.  Portions are large and pricing is reasonable.  They serve breakfast (8am), lunch and dinner 7 days a week.  Give Mike's a try when your in the area!   Very Slight update. Very surprised that many yelper's are making an issue about the atmosphere. People are making it sound terrible and that really isn't the truth. Just look at the pictures and see for yourself. Mike's is not high end and has a slight retro feel and is a whole lot better than many little dirty ethnic dumps you see on dirty dining.  Now THAT IS THE TRUTH!

Short Story- Worst donut I ever tasted in my life but the help seemed friendly and nice.  Longer Story- This is a very busy interactive donut shop located in across from the movies at the shops at Norterra on Happy Valley Rd. They fried up one kind of cake style donut and as you wait in line. They provide check off menu sheets with pens that differ from the choices of the menu board posted on the wall that leave you confused and unsure what to order when you make it up in line to the cashier.  I decided to try a blackberry crumb donut. I don't know what kind of donut I got was but I can tell you the main flavor was old grease topped with something they call glaze that taste like weird flavored pancake syrup that is sticky. The donut was also an odd shape and if it had a handle you could spin it like a top. My donut was greasy and was a crunchy sponge for grease soaked with weird sticky syrup topping.  Honestly this was the worst tasting donut I ever had in my life. Even donuts from cheap Chinese buffets taste better and are usually fluffy. Donuts from super markets aren't the best but they taste better too with a sweet glaze or frosting. I know Fractured Prune Doughnuts is a chain but I thought if they only made one flavor as the base donut they'd make a good one.  It's a possibility that I hit them when they were extra busy and didn't have time to change the oil. It's a busy pre-holiday weekend and also the opening week of the Star Wars Movie.  I just can't defend their glaze, that truly was awful tasting.  They offer inside and some outdoor seating. You can also do take out if you care too.  You might want to give Fractured Prune Doughnuts a spin but I won't so that's a one star to me.

This is a very large newly opened Sushi and Chinese restaurant with a large bar.  My review is based on only one lunch visit.  The service is hit and miss. My server was not at all familiar with the menu. I pointed to what I wanted on the menu and she still had to ask the kitchen if I could have it. After trying to order from her at least three times my husband tried to order and accidentally frightened her (because he is very loud with a deep voice) so she got another server to take our order and we had no problems at all with the other server.  We were going to share a house smoked 2 pc salmon sushi and both ordered the JC Lunch special that was 6 pieces of different Nigiri AND an Eight Piece Roll for $9.95 with an optional $1.00 upgrade charge for a Spicy Tuna Roll or a Las Vegas Roll.  They started us off with a bowl of Miso Soup followed by a crisp salad with fresh tasting Oriental Dressing.  Fresh Wasabi sauce is served on request for a $1.00 Charge. I recommend ordering the wasabi sauce.  We tried a two piece House Smoked Salmon Sushi. It was pretty good and tasty.  Then our big massive plates arrive. I checked the Nigiri and I did notice they didn't season under the fish but all the fish they served me was very fresh. The rice is seasoned more than from most sushi places I've been to but it was good. All the sushi stayed together and didn't fall apart. I thought the spicy tuna roll was very much above average. It was spicy and not all mayo upped.   I thought the Lunch items were good and reasonably priced. I was happy that the tuna was fresh and sweet tasting because I judge sushi places by the tuna. I can't eat the tuna from at least half the places I try so good tuna is a big deal.  They also offer Happy Hour Specials you might want to partake in. $2.00 Beer $5.00 Sushi 2:30-4:30 and 8pm-close

Short Story-                       ***************Breathtaking View*****************                      Farm to Table Great ingredients but Technically mostly Flawed.  Long Story-                      The menu on-line looks amazing but when you take the hike to drive here the menu is very abbreviated with few choices. We started off with two appetizers. One was a deviled local duck egg. The egg came from a very small duck because it looked hen sized. The filling was runny and lumpy and not flavored so great. The egg sat on top of chopped up egg whites that were very similar to rubber. Not a good start my stomach was turning after ingesting a very rubbery egg white.  The Seared Shishito Peppers were good but the Blueberry Sugar didn't make an obvious appearance in this dish. I don't know if I got any Blueberry Sugar.  I had the Melon Salad that was Almost Very Good but it was missing the radish flowers promised. My salad also contained Guanciale that was cold and greasy straight out of the refrigerator. This was suppose to be a meal and if you take the time to look at the picture you will see that this was not enough to be a meal. I feel that this plate should be on the appetizer menu. My server tried to be a comedian and said to me, "WOW you ate all that!" I felt like smacking him.  My husband had the Smokie. Everything on his plate was house made. He said the meat was packed very tight and was ground very fine. I think what he least liked about the sandwich was that you can't pick it up to eat because the roll was too tiny for the sandwich and you have to eat it with a knife and fork.   I was still hungry and was hoping dessert would be the saving grace but instead it was the nail in the coffin. Our server said one of two of the most favored desserts was the Strawberry - Lemon Icebox Cake. On my first bite I got something IN MY MOUTH THAT RESEMBLED A LUMP OF SILICON GLUE. I pulled it out and showed the waiter. He ran it back to the kitchen and they said it was gelatin. I don't know what it was but it seemed just like a lump of silicon glue. Here goes my stomach turning again. Even if the cake didn't contain that foreign object I thought it was not a restaurant quality dessert. It was like something from a box mix. It was like something a neighbor or an aunt would whip up and not something I was looking forward too.  Small Duck Egg with runny lumpy filling over rubbery egg whites Missing ingredients - radish flowers and possibly missing Blueberry Sugar Salad should be salad sized or be listed as an appetizer  Cold Greasy out of the refrigerator meat Smokie was not well thought out and should be functional as a sandwich Silicon-like object imbedded in dessert  Yup I've had better......  If you eat with your eyes all is ok  Good Luck

Almost everyone loves Ice Cream and yes it is pricey for Ice Cream but it's hand made small batch ice-creams and sorbets where you have options to add house made macarons and other things to your ice-cream.  Fatty Daddy's is HARD to find because there isn't a sign. (at the time of this review)  I hear that the flavors change weekly so you might not be able to try what I had.  I had the cantaloup sorbet as a mini Fatty Daddy. That means I had one scoop, one macaron and the option to add a house made torched marshmallow. A better value might be the full size Fatty Daddy because that is THREE Scoops, Two Cookies and a Marshmallow. But I went with the mini because the full size is just too much for me.  I thought the Cantaloup Sorbet was Amazing because it tasted just like the ripest perfect cantaloup. I picked an Almond Macaron to go with it and skipped the marshmallow. The macaron had a nice flavor but a very chewy texture almost like gum.  My husband also had a mini Fatty Daddy with Cinnamon Crunch Ice-cream and he asked for a vanilla macaron. He said the Marshmallow was really good. The ice-cream tasted good but the cereal in it was soggy. We also think they gave him the wrong flavor macaron because it didn't taste like vanilla to us and might have been red velvet?   3.5 stars not perfect, a little pricey but unique and some flavors really rock!

Nosh Eatery and Wine Bar Newly Opened in the location of the Shuttered Betty's Nosh. The atmosphere is modern and attractive. They offer private dining and have an indoor-outdoor bar and an interesting indoor-outdoor dog friendly patio. The menu is traditional American Cuisine.   I ordered the Roasted Chicken Arugula Wrap with a side of House Made Cole Slaw. I was expecting the wrap to be made with a tasty sounding sundried tomato basil mayo and cheddar cheese. Instead someone concocted a sauce that tasted similar to French Dressing mixed with Wing Sauce and the cheese they gave me was processed American Cheese. We also shared the Signature Macaroni and Cheese. This dish had promise because it was made with real cheese but unfortunately the sauce lacked any seasoning and was so watered down that it was weak.   My husband ordered the Signature Cheeseburger. Unfortunately the management didn't remove the Betty's Nosh Menu items from the computer system and our waitress accidentally ordered an incorrect burger with American Cheese instead of the Signature Burger with Gouda, Havarti, shoestring onions, fried egg on Brioche Bun. My husband alerted the waitress right away that she didn't bring him the burger he ordered. She brought it back to the kitchen and the cook recycled the burger scraping most of the American cheese off and then doctoring it up putting back on a regular bun instead of a brioche. But the worst part was that in the process the medium rare burger that my husband ordered turned to a well done burger.   To the management a professional cook would never do that to a burger. The sauces were very unprofessional The egg in the burger was also over cooked. I feel sick and very sorry for the new owner of the restaurant. He needs to hire someone who can cook or get help from someone who can cook NOW before it's too late.   This pains me very much because this place has such a lovely atmosphere and with a better cook this restaurant could be a hot spot in the area.  Newly opened and not ready for prime time but I do HOPE they get it together.

The atmosphere is sort of a mix of classic and modern retro. On the night I was there the music in the background was very old fashioned like from the 30's or 40's and was sort of fun to listen to. This restaurant offers a stunning looking bar and an outdoor patio. The tables inside are a mix of high tops and low tops. The menu is sort of American with accents.  We started with the Ahi Tuna Trio of Tacos. They were yum and easy to eat with the light jicama shells. They had all the right flavors going on. This dish might have been a little pricy for what it was but was delicious anyway.  For dinner I had the Jade Pesto Halibut. It was interesting and different with the cilantro pesto and curry sauce. They gave me a generous portion of halibut that wasn't seared but was sweet, flaky and moist. All the vegetables and black rice were tasty too. I thought this was very much worth the $23.00 because nice halibut dinners at other places usually run $30-34 out so this evens out the appetizer we had.  My husband had the Cola Braised Pork. Overall he was very happy with his dinner. I didn't taste the potatoes but my husband said for him they were boarder line salty and he said for me they'd be much too salty.  The only thing slightly odd was the bread service. We saw all the other tables getting bread and we didn't get any so we inquired about that. We were told they don't serve it unless you ask for it. The bread comes from Wildflower Bread Company so if you like their product you might want to know about this.  Our server was very friendly, cheerful and efficient.  Overall very good and I plan to return.

I am happy to update my review and I can now be a fan of this restaurant because on my latest experience the food was great tasting and technically very improved.  The Rogue Tomato is a fun new restaurant that recently opened in Glendale. The menu is mostly American with some Mexi American offerings.  This time we came for lunch on the comfortable umbrella covered patio that is also dog friendly. We came with our dogs and the kind server gave the dogs water right away.  I had the salmon sliders. They were very tasty and sort of fancy and different with a delicious lemon aioli and other toppings like cucumber and arugula. The fish was flaky and moist and even the bun was carefully toasted and seem buttered. My platter came with fresh hot crisp fries that were detailed with tasty seasoning. I also received ketchup and a fry sauce for dipping.   My husband had the Rogue Burger. He said the burger patty was a good tasting beef and he liked the crispy onions and everything else that came with it. It did come out a little more done than he likes but other than that everything was terrific about that plate.  Our server was really great!  You might want to check this place out when your in the neighborhood!  ******UPDATE******4-17-16*************** NO LONGER DOG FRIENDLY

This little bakery and cafe offers Indian Inspired flavored ice creams, regular ice cream, cake pops, cup cakes, coffee and more. It's a lovely sleek looking cafe with modern rich looking features. They offer mostly counter seating and do have two tiny tables.  They do offer you samples of the ice cream to try. I first tried saffron pistachio and the second one lightly ginger seemed better. My husband only sampled what I tried and just ordered the carrot halwa ice cream.  The ginger ice cream had a texture that was light and very unique. The flavor was intensely ginger and was sort of spicy but refreshing. I tried a taste of my husband's carrot halwa flavor ice cream. Both of us didn't care for this one mostly because of the greasy texture.  The girl working the counter was pleasant and efficient and the cafe seemed clean and spotless.  My main reason for the two star rating is that I was there forty minutes after they were open and not one baked good was ready for sale. I wanted to bring home some baked goods and I live far from here and I'm not always in this area so I doubt I'll be back.  This place has potential to be a gem but you have to get there when they are ready to be open for business.

At the time of this review this restaurant is a newly opened Thai Restaurant with two other locations. The decor is a mix of new and modern, old world Thai and Whimsey. They also have an outside patio.  We started out with the fish cakes appetizer. They were tasty but a little chewy.  I had the Spicy Basil and PUMPKIN with chicken number four out of five for heat. This was the best spicy basil dish I had on this side of town. The right amount of basil was used and got infused in the dish. The chicken was hand chopped and is more flavorful because of the texture. I got a good amount of crisp fresh vegetables. The number four heat level was just right for me and made my nose run. The portion was also larger than I was expecting.   My husband had the Spicy Basil with Beef. It was similar to my dish. I tasted the beef and it was good. I could eat beef here.  Service was good.   This is a FOUR STAR EXTRA!  This place is on my rotation!

At the time of this review this is a newly opened restaurant located in the AZ International Market Place Parking Lot. The interior of the restaurant is modern airy and sleek looking. My review is based on one lunch visit.  I had the Spicy Chirashi or Sushi Salad.  The seafood and greens seemed pristine fresh and I liked the choice of purple rice. The waitress was very kind and she told me Koreans eat the salad mixing in the rice to the salad.  I tried some of the Spicy Chicken Bulgogi from my husband's plate. It came out bubbling hot on a skillet. The chicken was expertly cooked and was very tender and moist. I didn't care for the sauce because it was cloyingly sweet and not so spicy.  I feel because of the sauce on the Bulgogi I would want to give this restaurant 3.5 stars but will round it up because of Service, Atmosphere and Freshness of food.  3.5 stars

Short Story-Health Focused Restaurant- Organic, Hormone Free, Local Farms, Grass Fed-                     Good Food - Small Portions - Great for dieters and Ladies that Lunch!                      Youthful Help - but inexperience shows at this time- Could use more training                     Modern Fresh Bright Atmosphere but energetic and very LOUD w/Techno Music                      Whole menu isn't offered till 3 on the weekends                       Newly opened and changes could be in progress  Long Story-  We entered and were told it would be a fifteen- twenty minute wait and we were the only people waiting. The hostess asked my husband for his phone number to call him for when our table will be ready. He says I'm right here, you don't need to call me. While we are waiting we look at the menu that is posted on the wall and see many things we are interested in only to find out latter that these items aren't actually offered until 3 o'clock.   We get seated in about 5 minutes and when the hostess pulls the chair out for me I see that it is wet with three good sized spills of water. I look at the hostess and she just smiles and doesn't say or do anything.....so I unravel the silverware and dry up the chair myself. Afterwards she said she'd bring me a new napkin.  I wasn't expecting a BRUNCH Menu because the whole menu is posted on their website as of yesterday 7-16-16. We asked about the items we were interested in and our server wasn't aware that these items weren't on the menu. The server said they offer everything at 3 o'clock.  I soon receive my Strawberry and Goat Cheese Salad with added Chicken ($13.00). The spinach didn't look like packed spinach and looked farm grown because it was the bigger leaves. The strawberries were the really delicious kind and don't taste like cardboard like the kind you buy from the store. The Goat Cheese was very good quality that was mild and very creamy. The chicken was flavorful but a little dry on the end pieces. I'm guessing the amount of chicken breast was about 2 ounces. I thought it was a good salad.  My husband had the steak sandwich. He asked for horseradish instead of horseradish sauce. His sandwich came slathered with very hot horseradish. It was too hot in some places and he should have asked them to put the horseradish on the side because he didn't think someone would put the very hot horseradish on so heavy. The bread that made up the sandwich was very good. The beef in the sandwich was good but it also seemed like two ounces. An eye catching fancy vegetable salad came with the sandwich that tasted very mildly flavored.  Don't know if they do this all the time but they offered us complimentary hot fresh vegan cookies. Tasty but slightly greasy.  I would come back for the food but would prefer a patio seat when the weather is right because the music was too loud for me.   My husband would not because his platter didn't satisfy him and he complained to me that he was still hungry.  3.5 stars - in the end the food was good and this restaurant is newly opened so I rounded the stars up.

WooHoo! - What's considered to be the west side has a better Chompie's than Paradise Valley!   This Chompie's is the newly opened one at Arrowhead Mall located by Macy's.  Chompie's is New York Inspired Style Restaurant and Deli that is well known for all day breakfast, bagels, bread, sandwiches and MORE! They also have the CHUTZPAH to offer deep fried Matzo Balls with Chipotle Ranch dressing on the menu.  I wasn't expecting too much because I ate at the Paradise Valley Location of Chompie's and it wasn't so great.   From service to food this was a world of difference and didn't even seem like the same restaurant at all to me. I was sort of blown away with the difference.  We were welcomed warmly when we came in. The manager introduced himself and other servers checked on us.  Soon complimentary kosher and half sour pickles arrive.  I ordered the 1/2 Pastrami Sandwich with Matzo Ball Soup. The Chompie's Bread was toasted and grilled to perfection. Pastrami was smoked and balanced with delicious flavors. The meat was succulent and melted in my mouth. It really was a delicious sandwich.   The matzo ball soup was very fresh tasting but just ok. I note that I am very picky. Most people will enjoy the matzo ball soup.   I also tasted a sample of some things from my husband's plate. Everything really was very good! Very good brisket, corned beef, cole slaw and potato salad.  Chompie's is one of the only places that sells "REAL" hand carved "LOX" not smoked salmon and also not Nova. People who actually know what lox is do prefer Belly Lox over nova because it taste better. You will not find lox at AJ's or most restaurants. As far as I know only Chompie's and Scott's sell real lox in the metro phoenix area.  So after lunch we visited the deli/bakery side to take home some lox. I didn't notice lox listed on the deli menu but I knew they sold it. So we ordered some and tasted a complimentary bakery sample. I tasted some sort of chocolate filled pastry and it was extremely good! It was so much better than what I tried from a few near by bakeries. I didn't know that Chompie's makes very good desserts. The dessert case looks so amazing your butt can expand just gazing at the desserts.  The lox we purchased was maybe the best I had this year but wasn't hand sliced perfect. My husband called the manager to let them know so they can work on it. It takes some skill to hand carve the fish correctly.  Overall very good!  It's GREAT that Chompie's Opened Here!

At the time of this review Tratto is a newly opened Farm to Table Style Restaurant. The James Beard Awarding Winning Chef and Staff hand pick Produce that is served. A specialty of the house is the hand made pasta that's made from local grains. The menu is limited and changes daily. It's suggested that you share appetizers, a pasta plate, a dinner and more. The atmosphere is energetic, farm fresh casual and a little shabby chic.   On my visit the servers I had were very well trained and knew the menu and were very suggestive about ordering. I warn you that if your server is Maria she will tell you that whatever you order is not enough and you will order maybe two more plates than you need.  They started us off with Crusty Bread, flavorful olive oil and a plate of fresh plucked sweet and flake salted tomatoes, house cured olives, grilled zucchini and house made salami.  We started with the Roasted Beets in Fig Leaves. They had this Gorgonzola Cream on them that was absolutely delicious. The fresh picked  beets do taste different from store purchased beets.  We shared the Farinata. Maria described it as a Chickpea Four Crepe with Tomatoes and Onions. It was really tasty. I felt I had to box it after tasting it or I wouldn't have room for everything else.  We then shared the Scarpinocc that was toothy Raviolis stuffed with milky sweet ricotta cheese in seasoned fava beans and fried sage. The pasta was perfect, The cheese tasted fresh made and the beans were quite a labor of love. Did you ever shell Fava Beans? It's a double shell process that takes all day. Yes it's not cheap but it was worth it for the labor and quality of the pasta and cheese.  For dinner we shared the small Two Wash Ranch Grilled Chicken with Lemon and Bay Leaf. It was simplistic but also perfection. I have to tell you that your $1.50 a pound chicken that you purchase from Safeway or Costco does not taste like a the Two Wash Chicken. This dish was expensive for a whole chicken dinner but I recently purchased a chicken from a local farm and those kind of chickens do cost $25-$30 each so it doesn't seem like it but the price is fair.  Maria also suggested that we needed the potatoes. The potatoes were delicious with the rosemary and garlic. I had to eat some because they were delicious.  The food I tried was amazing. The service was attentive. Maria might have suggested to us more food than we needed but it was all great.

Casa De Falafel in located in a Shell Gas Station. They serve up Falafels and Mexican Style Food in a Chipotle Style Fashion. When I was there they offered samples but weren't big on describing the food. My husband asked them what was a Fez Burrito and the man behind the counter said to look at the moving TV screen instead of telling us what was in the Fez Burrito.  I ordered a Falafel Plate. The Falafels are unlike any falafel I ever had.  They are very crisp and crunchy with a bread-like fluffy interior and coated with sesame seeds. They are made with a combination of chick peas and fava (broard) beans. The amount of seasoning in them was very scant and coriander, cumin, garlic and fresh parsley were not noticeably present. The dominate flavor of the falafel was sesame seeds. I didn't notice any pita bread being offered here.  Hummus and tahini were on the bland side and lacked a fresh tasting ingredient to add life and make them bright tasting like they should be.   My husband ordered the Chicken Mexican Bowl with Hot sauce. The woman working there said she didn't know what sauce was hot sauce. By looking at the menu we had to figure out ourselves that the red sauce should have been hot sauce.The chicken in the bowl was nicely prepared but the cilantro rice lacked enough cilantro to give give off a cilantro flavor. The hot sauce was made with fresh tasting tomatoes but lacked any heat. I think it was made with tomatoes and green bell peppers.  Although they proudly display a grade "A" Health inspection I can tell you the falafels, chicken and rice were all at room temperature and would not have passed a health inspection when I was there.  At the time of this review this restaurant has only been open a short time and might improve in time.

WARNING++++NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME at the time of this review 6-26-16 and the home brews won't be ready for a month.  Short Story- Menu reads like a Fantasy Novel. Sounds GREAT but is not what is served and whoever seemed like the manager didn't act like they listened to my criticism and didn't even say I'm sorry.  Long Story-  We got seated at an uncomfortable booth by the bar. I was going to start with a house crafted beer but found out the house brewed beer won't be ready for about a month. However they are selling other local beers so I went with something else.  We decided to share the Ahi Tuna Tostadas.   They come out from the food jockey WITHOUT sharing plates.  They were described on the menu as Ahi Tuna Tartare over a corn tostada with roasted corn and jicama slaw, pickled red onions and cilantro lime aioli.   I received one solid French Fry shaped piece of not the cleanest tasting tuna covered with cabbage cole slaw with maybe one corn kernel and some sort of loose white liquid. I brought this to the attention of the server and the server said that he would inform the kitchen. This was not served as described. This was hard to eat without sharing plates and hard to eat because log of tuna and also this wasn't delicious. This Cole Slaw sort of clashes with Ahi Tuna. Maybe fresh bright cilantro would have saved it if they had some on it?  I had the Falafel Burger. The Falafel was ok and didn't seem like it was made with fresh herbs but was made with the correct flavors so that was ok to me. The green curry coconut yogurt lacked the green curry taste and the coconut taste and seemed the same as the loose white liquid from the Ahi Tuna Tostadas. I wasn't able to eat it with the bread as a sandwich. I can't imagine anyone would be able to eat this as a sandwich because nobody on earth has a mouth that big. I think one burger size patty would have worked out better than two small thick patties.  I do note they do offer a bun-less option I should have went with.   As my side I had the Roasted Corn and Jicama Slaw THAT DIDN'T CONTAIN ANY CORN OR JICAMA and was just cabbage slaw. I wasn't able to eat the cole slaw because it was unappetizing It had something with a orange tint added that didn't taste right to me.  Even though this is a newly opened restaurant there is still no excuse to serve food like that.  Someone checked on us that might have been a manager.  I showed her the slaw. The woman said at first that you know jicama looks like cabbage and then my blood started to boil. NOW THAT MADE ME ANGRY. To me she insinuated that I don't know the difference between cabbage and jicama. I Shoved my fork in it and it was green shredded cabbage. Then she said something like they were busier than they expected to be and she guessed they ran out of stuff. She said that she would tell the kitchen.  I told her the correct thing to do is to be honest with the customer. I told her that it wouldn't be an issue if my server was honest with me and me that they ran out out of roasted corn and jicama slaw. I wouldn't be mad at all because then that is what I would expect or I'd have the option to order something different.  TO ANY RESTAURANT- If you run out of stuff you have two choices. 1- Take it off the menu. They call that 86 it in restaurant language 2- Be honest with your guest (if you want them to return) and tell them you are out of X and are substituting with Z  My husband had the Beer Cheese Steak with Fries. The steak was tender and the sandwich with fries were OK but it would have been nice if we were offered ketchup for the fries.  As really ok as the steak sandwich was......Between the substitutions, misses, and possibly management attitude.  This is really one star to me. I don't plan to return.  I'll be generous since they are a newly opened restaurant. They have potential to be good someday because of a lovely written menu but need strong leaders for food execution and they need someone with front of house skills.  Good Luck!  As a slight update 6-30-16 received a not warm or fuzzy response from S48B. Telling me Not to visit their restaurants. I posted S48B correspondence with the photos I uploaded.

**********************HIDDEN ROUGH GEM ALERT*********************************  Very Good***************Mexican Style Seafood Restaurant***************On the West Side  Located in not the prettiest part of Peoria in not the newest looking strip mall is a El Alboroto Mariscos Y Chavelas. At the time of this review the restaurant is hard to find because the sign above the restaurant reads AZ Kitchen Mexican Food.  I do warn you that you are not coming here for atmosphere because the entrance seems very unfinished. You pass by an deserted hostess stand a bar and piles of chairs and then make your way to the dining room. This isn't a fancy place and you are only here for the food.  Not all but the majority of the menu is mostly shrimp, octopus or fish.  They started us off with fried corn tortillas, lots of limes and a house made salsa that was very unique with tomato sweetness. The tables are filled with many Mexican Bottled Sauces.  They started us off with fried Fish tacos that were fresh tasting and tasty with a creamy spiced sauce. They were similar to tacos I had in Mexico.  Soon the entrees arrived and that is what blown us away. I had the Pescado Empapelado - Wrapped Fish ($11.95) where the fish is cooked with peppers, onions and seasoning in it's own juices. They didn't give me a muddy fish like tilapia or catfish and used a better tasting sea bass. This fish was SO FRESH TASTING and prepared to PERFECTION. It was such a joy to eat. I really think it the best fish I had from any of the Mexican Restaurants in the Metro Phoenix area. It seemed fresher and was a better tasting fish prepared more perfect. My dish came with seasoned rice and a salad garnish that included sliced ripe avocado. This dish was just like a fish dish I had from a seafood restaurant in Mexico. The entrees also came with HOT STEAMY tortillas.  My husband had the Camaron A La Diablo - Spicy Shrimp. Very Good, spicy but not too spicy with other lingering flavors. Shrimp were cooked nicely. The plate was set up the same as mine.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The owner Jose was very friendly and welcoming.   Very Good Seafood, low prices, rough atmosphere.   Rough Gem!  Go HERE for the fish and you'll be hooked!
