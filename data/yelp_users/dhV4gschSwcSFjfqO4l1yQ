This was my first time at Wendy's, my best friend had been going here forever so I assumed it wouldn't be too bad.   To start we were instantly greeted and the place looked clean. Unfortunately there was mostly dark colors of polish to choose from which was a huge bummer. My friend got her nails started and I sat next to her waiting for someone to become available to do mine, mind you I was the only one waiting. A few minutes later two ladies walked in and were taken care of before myself when the other technicians were finished, I let it slide. After 20 minutes went by, Wendy (the owner) arrived and started my full set. She was rough and rushed the whole time. Meanwhile another customer came in, she waited, but was obviously impatient. She offered to come back, but Wendy rushed through my nails, which are uneven and have gunk underneath them. She told me to wait aside as she give this lady a fill and polish change. So I waited for her to complete the other lady while I waited to get my polish. She rushed painting the polish, as well as making a mess around my fingers. I'm only content with my nails, and I will not be going back.

As sketchy as this place may look, they have smokin' deals. You need patience to go through the clothing, but if you take your time, you'll find some quality pieces. I purchased two pairs of jeans, one shirt, three pairs of pajama pants, one sweater, and two tank tops for about 27 bucks.

With it being Sunday my normal place was closed so I found this place on here and given the 4+ stars I thought why not.   Very clean and sterile shop! There was a huge selection of polishes.  I was extremely satisfied with pedicure.  I recommend and will be returning !
