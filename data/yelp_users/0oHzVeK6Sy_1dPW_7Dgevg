Boo gamestop for gouging your customers. I was calling around to find ps3 rockband 3 because it's not made anymore I assumed I would find it at a decent price previously used. Well gamestop, because they don't make it anymore you decide to sell it for $35. Really? Oh and your comment on why it's so pricey is because they done make it anymore. Bad idea. Hey I called zia and it's only $11 because they are not assholes and don't take advantage of people. Never will I shop here again!

Omg. Busy? Fuck yes. Awesome food that's very delicious? Oh fuck yes. People need to shut the fuck up about how busy this place is. Be patient and get some good ass bowl and go home. Extra guacamole? Yes please, and I use their app and it is seriously awesome! Just order ahead and pick up. Can it be more amazing?

This store has such a bad rap, but I go there at least twice a week and love it! Everyone is super nice, especially the cosmetics lady! I deal with the pharmacy staff and they will always let me know if I should wait or come back because of the volume and that is awesome. This place can get super busy so if you're in a hurry, quit your bitchin' and drive on. I appreciate this place, and will remain a loyal customer.

Ok. Let's just be serious for a moment. When you're home, and it's too hot to cook and you've worked all day...what about this crab puff craving you have? You call this place, like right now. It's so delicious for a empty not-so-busy place. Everything is so good, and delivery is ridiculous fast. You can easily find the menu online, sort of like all the other places out there, but their food is hot and delicious. If you ask for sauce on the side, everything is crunchy and amazing. Do it, and get the crab puffs. You know you want to!

Alright. So I realize this is a gyro business, and yes they are reaaaaaally delicious....however I have to give most of the credit to their burgers. Burgers? At a gyro place? YES! And let me tell you, they have the best burgers anywhere. Homemade meat they grind in house and the flavor...o.m.g. So good. The meal will run you about 9 bucks, but lets be honest... I will pay anything for a good burger. Do it..get one and tell me how amazing it is. I dare you!

Orange chicken? Yes please! IT's so good here, and it's so much better when you eat it in there dinning room because it's SO good super hot. The only thing bad I'll say is there new delivery. I ordered lunch for my family on day and I called at 1pm. I called back 3 times after over 90 minutes waiting for my food. Like the idiot that I am, I still payed for it and tipped the guy..and only because there stupid orange chicken is so good...but I was really pissed that it took so long. So don't order in from here, make sure you eat it there!

I cannot say one bad thing about this place. Just get there early because the wait can be ridiculous. I love everything on the menu, but my family and I share the via mexico dinner most of the time. We share dinners because the chips and salsa are amazing!! yum-o.

I think I might have a problem with going here WAY too often. I have noticed I have had to up my cardio ALLOT due to all the awesome food I have that comes from this place. I have tried everything at least 300 times, but my all time 'go to' item is the Emerald Chicken. Oh mama that is good stuff. The black beans and jerk fried rice I would eat on a daily basis. And who else gives you a cookie for ordering? I feel like it's my birthday every time I get a cookie. YUM!   One thing, try not to use the bathroom so often, it's slightly horrific. And no mirror? Really NO mirror in a woman's bathroom? Just wrong man...so wrong.

I need to say a few things about this awesome place. First off I have friends who work here and are amazing. Also I go to the gas station so often and don't have to wait anymore since they put in more pumps. Thank fuck! But in all seriousness this place is fantastic and the Chinese food in the rear is pretty good too. Really? A store where you can shop and get Chinese take-out? Hollar.

This place has been my store for almost 7 years on and off and I love it. All of the employees are really nice and super helpful. I was extremely lost after the remodel and employees would actually walk with me and explain how they were lost too. I've been going for so long that the employees know me and it makes me feel special.  It's really clean and red box is a plus. Also they are putting in a gas station which is so awesome!! I can't wait till it's open and I don't have to drive far to get gas anymore.

No more going to this frys ever again. I live so close I can throw a rock and hit them, but I will now go out of my way to not go there ever again. It smells awful. So awful I turned around to leave as soon as I walked in. It is a gross pee sort of sewer smell that has permeated the whole place. No thanks, I'll go to another from now on. Ew!!

Heck no, this place is awful and I didn't even get to try the food. My family and I went on a Sunday and the place was packed so I was thrilled! A new place with such great food that there was only one table open. Awesome right? Um no. Apparently that was the 'do not serve' table and we didn't see anyone for 10 minutes to take our order. We didn't even get drinks!! Our stupid asses sat there for 45 minutes and our food wasn't there yet. So I talked to the manager and she gave me a story about how a waitress just walked out durning our order but did not offer us anything. Not that I was expecting much but not even a sorry???  I was so ticked off. We ended up walking out. Never. Again.

This place is fan-freakin-tastic. It's a hole in the wall. Maybe 7 or 8 tables. But seriously, the food is so delicious! Omg... Where to start! The happy hour menu is seriously good, and they have this crispy rice roll that is so interesting. It's deep fried rice with spicy tuna on top. Yum-o. Shits about to get real though when I tell you about the one item I eat every time I go there. Heart-attack!!!! First thing I do when I eat this is try and not look like an idiot. They don't have forks at a sushi place, well they prolly do but I'm not going to be the only person to actually ask for one. But really? Two sticks to eat rice? How did those win out?! Secondly, I try not to cry because it's so good. Anywho, the reason I try not to look like and idiot is because the pieces they cut are giant! Three bites all rolled into one delicious piece of heaven. It's a tempura roll with jalape√±o, cream cheese and other mouthwatering ingredients. So i see myself choking on this every time I go to yen..but the taste is so overwhelming awesome. Don't bite it in half either, I tried this once and the other half landed in my wasabi/soy sauce bowl and made a huge splash everywhere. But in all seriousness, please go there and try it and think of me when you do, because you will also try and eat this in one bite and visions of choking will also cross your thoughts. Chew and enjoy this amazing piece of deliciousness in the west valley.

Best place ever and super awesome people working there. Busiest bux in the valley so might be a wait, but deal with it...it's not fast food. And who stops to get coffee when you're running late? Tip your baristas!!!! No it's not built in. ;)

Everyone that was there is gone ad it's gone downhill. I feel bad for the customers that have to wait over 20 minutes in drive thru because there are not enough employees there. So sad.

Wow. Just wow. This gem is located all tucked away in the back of a strip mall, but holy crap this place is awesome! I tried almost everything but my favorite thing to order is the falafel. One... Because it's like eating a deep fried delicious hummus ball (anything deep fried is better anyway) AND because it's so fun to say. Say it with me now fa-la-fel. But really, their gyro sauce... Deliciousness. I try and go at as often as possible. Only problem is, my eyes are always bigger then my stomach. Please also order the hummus. It's warm and so so SO good.

I can NOT say enough about how great this place is. The people that work there have been working there FOR-ever. And all their sassy attitude makes me want to come back everyday. Not to mention I get coupons for this place in the mail at least once a month. I love trying new things, but their biscuits and gravy will stick to you all day. And they have a great el cheap -o menu if you get there before 10:30. What? Breakfast with me soon, why yes please. :)

Holy shit. This place is fantastic. The atmosphere leaves something to be desired since I'm not a hippy or a pothead however the food and staff are amazing. Everyone's always super friendly and the griefo sub is so good! Who knew I would like a sub without meat. No I will not be turning vegan, and the closest I come to eating raw is unbaked cookie dough. No seriously, I'm not a pothead. Also delicious are the little treats you buy near the front register. Homemade rice crispy squares, things made with peanutbutter. Dude, I love you man! Oh, only complaint is the rest room. Do not use it. Or any restroom on that city block. Trust.

This place is so great. The staff was so friendly that I tipped almost 45%! The food was delicious and the combos are super big and plenty to take home to enjoy an hour later when you're hungry again. I have been there so often and I now recommend them as the place to go on the west side. Please stop in and sit if you can, you'll fall in love with the staff just like I did.

I will travel for a delicious burger. So why the eff did I not know about this place that I can effing walk to? Seriously?! First thing, when you walk in, you're overwhelmed by all of the yummy soda. I mean there is stuff here that your parents grew up with. Jolt cola? Yummo! Espresso cola? Why yes please, butterscotch root beer? Omg yum. And here's a fun fact, you can make ANY OF THEM  a float! Sold! Next thing is the burgers. The bun is effing delicious. So not only is this burger giant, but the bun will not fall apart. I'm not sure if they are made in house, but who cares! Lastly the fries. Oh god. Fresh potato fries that are cooked to perfection. This is a great place to have a cheat meal, plus they are very quick with the cooking and delivery to your table. This place is a KEEPER!

I really liked the atmosphere in this place, plus they had a great football game while we ate, but the overall burger experience was ok. It was like a mexican version of smash burger. Long wait time, GREAT smell. I would have liked more smokey flavor in the actual burger, but all in all it was really good. Oh, and I recommend a crap load of napkins because it's ridiculously messy.

Finally...a delicious Mexican food place that seats more then 10. The food is soooooo so good. Every time we go we have something new and it's always hot and fresh. Also their margarita selection is outstanding. I am a regular customer now and so is my whole family.

No, just no.  So dirty, always out of soap and paper towels. Only meat heads that care about other meat heads. Terrible account management as well. Doesn't even deserve a star.

This place offers a super cheap-o breakfast, so being a broke single parent, I invite my folks out to eat. We sat down and got some really bad coffee, we order the 2.99 deal and waited a very long time. There were only 2 other tables so an excuse of being to busy was not an option. The cook was REALLY busy watching t.v. Behind the bar though.  So along with our 3 cheap -o meals I ordered a small pancake, when the food came out the pancakes didn't AND the food was cold and gross. Eggs were dry, potatos were dry and the toast was not buttered. To top it off there was no seasoning. None. How the eff do you screw up breakfast? We said something to the waitress about the missing pancakes and she just informed me it would just "not be on the bill" no offer to actually make them, and not even offering a sorry. After the awful expierence at this place I actually go out of my way and tell others how bad it is and to not EVER waste your time eating there. Thanks Daddy o's, but not thanks.

It's sooooo good! Please bring your bff here and tell your mom! And text me because we are prolly here already! Fuck. I can't stop cursing because this place is so good!!!
