Brings the taste of the islands here in AZ.  We have been eating here for several years and never had a bad meal.

My husband an I used a groupon deal to try them out. Good thIng as they are a bit pricey. The food was bland, not what you expect from Mexican. Everything tasted watered down. Too many other restaurants to waste $30 on a meal for two.

Gave this place a try due to other yelp reviews.  I was not dissappointed! What they lack in decor they make up on food.  For $24 my husband and I had chips and salsa, 2 big chimichangas, drinks, and I also had a marguerita.

Great outing for the entire family! I love going here on Saturday mornings.  I love to support local business.  You can get fresh in season produce, salsa, spices, honey, and several hot food items for breakfast, lunch or dinner to eat there or take home.  Bring your dog too (on a leash of course)  Fun for the kids too as they have face painting.

Excellent Breakfast.  If you are looking for something fresh and exciting for breakfast check them out.  We had excellent service from Adam.  It was our first time in for breakfast so we sampled several menu items and shared.  The butter sauce for the pancakes is liquid crack!  We were also given a sample of their smoothie.   It made my hubby a yogurt lover.   The gravy on the biscuits n gravy was not heavy like everywhere else.  The chirozo gives it a yunique touch.

I went in on a wim to highlight my hair.  I'm so glad I did.  I spent quite a while there but it was because I have long hair.  Will definitely be back again to see Flor.

Excellent food and service.  Don't let the outside of the place fool you. Lovely decor inside sets the tone for the fabulous food.  Yunique items not seen in other Mexican food restaurants in the valley.  Dessert is a must!

Better then home- made!  The crust on their crum topped pie was buttery and flakey. A little pricey but soo worth it.

First timer for breakfast.   Food was good, never got our toast after asking for it.  Was very uncomfortable as there were several drunks at 9:30 am and they were continued to be served.  Will not be returning.

Best Chinese food we have ever had.  The place is small, must do more take out and delivery.  We had cheese puffs, spring rolls and the teriyaki ninja beef.  The beef was amazing.  Will definitely be back again.

Great food friendly service.   It is a one man show but it is so worth the wait.  I had the club sandwich and the 4 of a kind appetizer.  Awesome.  We were here for taco Tuesday.  Hubby had them and said they were good.  Family also had a burger and they are huge.
