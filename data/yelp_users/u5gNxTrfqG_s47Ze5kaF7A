I come from a family who were all born and raised in New Mexico. My standard for New Mexican food is extremely high. The rolled tacos were pretty good, the green salsa was on point, but the red chili with cumin lost me. It killed all the delicious natural flavor of red hatch chili. It also took forever to get helped.

This is my third time here. I always like to give places more than one chance to impress me. I should have guessed after the first two attempts that it would not have been any better. Unfortunately it was even worse, I got the black and blue burger and it was disgusting. Not only was the turkey bacon hard as a rock, it was cold. The side of sweet potato fries were burnt in places and cold in others not mention limp like a wet noodle. (There were about 6 of them on my plate) If I wanted food that was sitting around and waiting to be warmed up until I ordered it, I would have gone to the Jack n' the box in the same parking lot and probably had a better burger. Obviously everything is processed and not cooked to order. The fresh, clean, pure food with a twist is a cleaver marketing tactic to get people  in the door. There was nothing fresh, clean or pure about it and the twist was the food is horrible.

I am very picky when it comes to anything from a bakery. I loved loved loved everything  about this place! The juices are great, the bread is homemade and the Texas sheet cake is the best I've had outside my own mothers kitchen. Highly recommend it!
