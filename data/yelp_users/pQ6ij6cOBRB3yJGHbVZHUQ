My wife and I went to see Les Miserables last night. I found the cast and production to both be first class. Immensely enjoying, my wife even cried during "I dream a dream." It was our first time at Phoenix Theatre and we will be back. The theatre provides a small, intimate setting which, in my opinion, elevates the overall experience. Did I mention FREE PARKING? If we had to pick only one favorite from the show, it would be Eponine (played brilliantly by Jenny Hintze). Her voice is amazing and my wife and I both loved her portrayal of Eponine. I see in her program bio that she has been in lots of productions and it is no wonder why. Thanks for a great first experience Phoenix Theatre, we will see you soon!

I really hoped this would be a nice outing for my nephew while he was here. It was ok, but just ok. Many of the animals were "not currently on display" and most attractions, shows, etc. were closed. The ones that were open, Sting-Ray Bay, Trolley ride, etc. you had to pay more to participate. Seems a little steep since we had already paid $30 for one adult and one child's ticket. Zoo itself is in a mediocre state of repair. A frozen lemonade was almost $6! Unless you have absolutely nothing else to do, i would suggest you skip this "gem".

Great employees with excellent customer service. You pay more here obviously, but to me its worth it. They have REAL butchers as opposed to most of the chains that employee meat "processors", most of the time meaning they could not identify a tri-tip or flat meat cut if their life depended on it. AJs has a good selection of a wide variety of international foods. My main reason for this trip was DARK or BLACK Sesame oil. Check!

Took the contractor's label off of the paint that was used during the construction of our home to get an exact match. To make a LONG story short, they got it wrong. Had to go back again today and have them remake it. Waited over an hour to get one gallon of paint mixed. I like the quality of the paint, but the customer service, or lack thereof, has made me mark them off my list.

BEWARE! This hack outfit is interested in nothing but YOUR MONEY. Had an appointment at 11 a.m. today for heartworm testing and prescription refills for my two Husky's yearly heartworm medicine. 30 minutes before the appointment (just now) they call and tell me "there is a problem" and I will need to spend an ADDITIONAL $150 for a "wellness exam" before they can do the heartworm test. PATHETIC! There is no "exam", just a SCAM for MORE MONEY. NEVER AGAIN! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED Yelpers!

Really great place. Small and cozy, they have a good selection of many cuisines. Mostly centered around noodles and pasta, but with great soups and salads as well. My wife and I really enjoyed our lunch. She had the hot beef Thai Salad and I had the Miso ramen with salmon. No complaints here!

Another GREAT meal here. Took the family tonight and got in pretty quick even though they were busy. My son had the miso ramen, I had the assorted tempura dinner and my wife ordered the tofu salad. We shared the squid salad appetizer and of course they always bring out bread & butter with your drink order. Everything was yummy as usual. My wife tried the mango tango drink? Very unusual taste, but in a good way. Already contemplating when our next visit will be.

Went here for a much needed and long over due eye exam. I felt like Dr Mastores and her staff did a very thorough exam and were not rushed. She took the time to answer all of my questions and there was no attempt to "up sell" me on any additional services or even glasses for that matter. The office staff is friendly, courteous and efficient. It seems they have a very good selection of glasses, including the designer brands like Tiffany & Co, Gucci, etc. I plan to return here every year for my eye exams.

Took my son here because of my past experience with Dr Mastores for a comprehensive eye exam after he broke his glasses while playing basketball. Wouldn't change a thing in my last review. Staff was friendly, courteous and out of their way helpful. Dr Mastores is a delight and my son thought she was great. Next up is getting my wife in for her eye exam. See you guys again soon!

My wife took me here for my birthday. She was planning on returning to the Royal Palms (T. Cooks) that we enjoyed so much last time, but they are closed for remodeling right now. I guess everything happens for a reason. We were VERY happy with Wright's! The service, food, ambience...EVERYTHING was OUTSTANDING! We will be back!

This was my son's idea and gift to their Mom for Mother's Day. We had reservations for 9:45 brunch and even though we were a few minutes early, there was a nice buzz in the restaurant and they seated us right away. There was a starter buffet with just amazing smoked fishes, meats, cheeses, fresh fruits, salads and breads/pastries. There was a fixed selection of entrees, cooked to order and again, all of our dishes were excellent. Myself and one of my sons had the Surf N Turf (Lobster and Petite Filet), my other son had the scallops and my wife ordered the fish, although I cannot for the life of me remember what kind it was. I do remember however that she loved it and we all had not a single complaint! There was also a dessert buffet with every type of flavor palette you could imagine. Chocolates, truffles, cakes, creme brûlée, tarts and more. Way to go guys! AWESOME!

Super neat place. My first visit was quite impressive. A little quirky, this place has a little bit of everything. Met some friends for lunch at 11:30 and it was already busy. They have FREE valet parking and inside & outside seating. Breakfast all day, coffee bar, fresh pastries and MORE! Also some neat and unusual gifts are available. NICE!

First time here was lunch yesterday. Very few people present, but it took our server more than 10 minutes to make first contact. "I didn't know you guys were here", I believe were her exact words. Sat outside, and it was nice but a little on the warm side for me. Scavenger birds were everywhere, landing on the tables and even plates (used & unused) looking for food. When diners left, birds immediately converged on their table and started eating. There is something very disconcerting about a blackbird eating sour cream off of a half-eaten burrito... I digress. I had the seafood burrito which was very good. Rice & beans were no better or worse than other restaurants in this class. My friend had the chicken sour cream burrito and also said it was good. Our table was very unstable, and it took more than one request to get something to shove under the "short" leg to stabilize it. Overall, not bad, but I probably will not be back.

SLOW SLOW SLOW. We waited almost 45 minutes for them to change the oil in two cars that were in progress before we ever arrived. Then it was another 30 minutes to change our oil. No "jiffiness" here. Always try to up sell you unnecessary services and products using fear tactics. We won't be back.

These "residential suites" are nothing more than a run down, dated and dirty cheap hotel. Typical low class residents, guests and especially "management". What a joke! They will try to get $$ from you anyway they can. My son was going to rent a studio here, but after we experienced the "management" first hand we decided not to proceed. Kept his money anyway. BEWARE! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED NOW TWICE by your fellow Yelpers! Stay clear of this dump and their minimum wage staff.

After contacting almost all of the other Ford dealers in the Phoenix metro area, Bell Ford was the only one that didn't respond to my internet request with the same old tired "when can you come in?" ploy. HARLEY WILLIAMS actually answered all of my questions via email and did not try and pressure me to come in immediately. After I was satisfied that they could help, I went in for a test drive. Ultimately I decided to get exactly what I wanted, I would need to order it. They did not try and pressure me into taking what they had and after thinking it over for a few days, I ordered a new vehicle. I wish other dealers would realize that although high pressure sales tactics may indeed work in the short-term, it never lasts. People feel bad about their purchase and therefore rarely recommend the business to others or have their vehicle serviced there for fear that the service experience will be like the sales process. The initial reason I gave Bell Ford a try was from the recommendation of a friend of mine. I was given a time frame for my vehicle delivery of 6-8 weeks and a website where I could track my order. I will update this review at a later date to finish the review of how my order actually turned out. Also a shout out to MIGUEL SALAZAR who showed me the new F150s and accompanied me on my test drive.

Bought one of their oil change "packages." 2 hours for an oil change.(SEE PHOTO POSTED) What they don't tell you is they don't like their package customers and when they find out your using a discounted service, they put you at the end of the line and keep on bumping you as new "non-discount" customers come in. PATHETIC! I will NEVER spend $$$ at Fletcher's again. BEWARE!

Busy Friday night, but seated quickly. Beverage choice was brought out speedily and my server, Jorge, was fast, efficient and friendly. I had the Caramelized onion and bacon flatbread as my appetizer. Very nice combination of sweet and savory. Minestrone soup was well seasoned and full of vegetables. Chicken  picatta was wonderfully cooked and seasoned perfectly. Sautéed vegetables were spot on. I had to take the Cherry Cheesecake to go, but later that same night it was a perfect ending to a truly great meal! I am a BIG fan and will definitely become a regular here.

Very average in every way. Staff eating while making customer food. Way over staffed considering the very mediocre level of customer service. "Manager" went out to smoke, came back inside and started preparing food without washing his hands. Even though the drive thru business is very light, they seem to ask almost every car to pull up, park & wait??

Went here to try them out after Sai Wan Bistro. Walked in to the store and there was no one in the store. No customers, no staff to be seen anywhere? Waited a couple of minutes and walked out. I'll bet the owner wonders why his business is in the toilet. As we left, we drove behind the building and the "staff" was outside smoking and texting. To the Owner: Please notify the bankruptcy court of you soon to be filed application.

I knew this place's pickleball program had a pretty bad reputation, but I wanted to check it out for myself. It meets and exceeds the bad reputation in every way. The players are cliquish and snotty. There are a couple of old guys that have deemed themselves "in charge" and try to tell everyone who to play with and even how to play. If they don't like the way you play, your wrong and they are right. They team up 2 of their "A" players with two others whom they think they can beat. If you win, they start telling you how good they are and how poorly you play. Just a sad situation in general. I guess there are always people who feel the need to disparage others in an effort to make themselves feel better. Like many, many others who have tried this place out, I won't be back. The facility itself is really pretty run down and tries desperately to hold itself out as something elitist. In reality, about the same level as a run down YMCA.

These guys have to seem their act together. A good system in place for testing and advising students new to the campus. Placement testing is walk-in and you get your results immediately. You can then meet with an academic advisor immediately to plan your class schedule, register, etc. Staff is friendly and helpful, which is a little unusual because at most community colleges, the staff act more like postal employees who dread their very existence. Well done GCC!

Went here to renew my DOT physical. Not my first time using the company, but my first time in this new location. Waiting area is small and can get crowded because many CDL holders come here. Staff is always friendly including Dr Paule. They have a process and it works well. DOT physical is only $35 and includes everything. Get there EARLY, even if you have to wait a few minutes before they open, it will save you wait time in the long run. Parking area is also small, but adequate.

What a great find. My wife and I went here for the 1st time a few days ago. She made me take her back again today for lunch. The restaurant itself is typical Mom n Pop Asian style decor...nothing fancy in other words. I'm not there to look at the walls, I want great food and this place has it. Busy both times we have been, but never had to wait for a table or good service. Chit-chat is a minimum when ordering and food comes out relatively quickly. Beef Pho is awesome as well as the fresh spring rolls and fried ones. The portions are ample and the prices are cheap. It's clean, quick, friendly and most importantly YUMMY! We've found a new Vietnamese place to frequent! YES!

Woke up to a half flat tire and found a screw in it. Luckily, I was able to add some air and hobble over to Discount Tire after checking the Yelp reviews of this location. Got there a couple minutes before they opened and there were 2 or 3 people already waiting. They opened a minute or two EARLY, which impressed the hell out of me. Most places drag it out and end up a couple minutes late opening the doors. The guys were lined up inside and as customers came in each staff member grabbed a customer and started working. Again, very impressed. LOVE IT when customer service is held to such a high standard, instead of you having to seek help out. The manager, JAY SIMMONS, helped me out and I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. When I asked about the bill for the tire repair the technician said NO CHARGE. Really? "When you need new tires, I hope our service will make you want to come back to see us! Have a great day!" Really? Can't say enough good things about this location! THANKS GUYS!

OMG, are their ANY competent fast food places anymore? Two customers in the restaurant around 3pm'ish and THREE people behind the front counter with 4 more in the back kitchen area. No lie, it took these guys almost 9 minutes to put 10 pcs of chicken in a bucket and hand it to me! With my to-go order, no condiments, utensils, plates, napkins...nothing. And they want to raise the minimum wage??? Really?

These guys are always OK in my book. They have above average customer service in my book and seem to try very hard. On occasion, they have been out of one type of chicken or another and the manager has always substituted another kind (at my request) and offered some freebie as compensation for the inconvenience. I appreciate the effort.

OK, I have had my eye critically on this location for some time now. Verdict: MUCH IMPROVED over former staff. Managers on duty are always actually on-duty and working. Cleanliness has gone way up since my last review. Staff is always friendly and customer service is quite a bit above average in my experiences with other locations. They are definitely on the right track. This location could certainly use a renovation, but overall I have been well pleased as of late.

This is the real deal guys! My first visit here was on Easter Sunday for early dim sum. The place was already busy when we arrived at 10 a.m., but we were seated immediately. It's always a good sign to see a dim sum restaurant filled with Chinese customers happily munching away. The dim sum was really good and the service was fast and efficient. By the time we left, there was a line out the door waiting to be seated. TIP: Get here early (within 30 mins of opening) and you won't have to wait. This is definitely going to be one of our new favorite places for dim sum!

These guys don't seem to be able to keep staff or standards consistently. When we walked in, the young lady behind the counter just looked at us and didn't say a word. She just continued shuffling bagels from one spot in the display case to another. After a couple of minutes, the only young man there, finished texting on his cell phone and came over to ask what we wanted. The food was not bad, just average for any Einstein location and our order was correct. The restaurant itself was in bad need of cleaning, despite there being only four customers there in addition to us. There were dirty tables, dirty floors and when I went to the restroom, I wanted to puke it was so disgusting. I think we are done here. (See Photos)

The guy that worked there was polite, but the lady behind the cash register was SCARY looking and had this "I just sucked lemons" look on her face. Ugh.

This is actually kind of sad. The customer service here is very good. Food was served quickly and tasted fine. Here's my problem. I ordered a 3 pc meal. What I got was two pieces of chicken (leg & thigh) and the one thigh had been cut into two pieces. No, really, I'm not kidding! (see photo) WTF? Are you kidding me. Then, once you get to your table and sit down, you realize the Salt Police have left a note insinuating that your eating too much Sodium and you need some extra exercise if you want the salt shaker because you have to get back up and go get one. COME ON GUYS! For a $10 meal I want 3 REAL pieces of chicken and a salt shaker! Ugh!

Went here because I was in the neighborhood and wanted to get a few ink cartridges refilled. Customer service here is really subpar. Girl behind the photo counter refused to even acknowledge me until I actually called for her outloud, even though she had looked up from her cell phone twice. I really wish Costco would prevent employees from using their cell phones while on duty and in plain sight of customers. It is very unprofessional. Go to the back, use it on break but not in front of customers.

I hesitantly went here this morning to purchase a sale item. I knew it would be in high demand, so I was expecting the worst. VERY pleasantly surprised! Opened the doors right on time, fully staffed and well organized, I got exactly what I wanted in very good time. Staff were all friendly, courteous and helpful. This is what I expect from a business, customer service wise! GOOD JOB GUYS!

Dr Cathcart and his staff were wonderful! This was my first visit here and I was impressed. His front office staff are all friendly and accommodating. Dr Cathcart was thorough and my adjustment immediately relieved my discomfort. I was well pleased with every aspect of my treatment and this will be my Chiropractor of choice from now on. Thanks to everyone at Arizona Life Chiropractic Center!

I ordered some work boots online and when I received them, they were damaged. I returned them to this store for exchange, but they did not have my size in stock. It took the young lady FOREVER to find the order in her computer. Then she had to call the manager and I had to wait an additional amount of time. Then he had to leave and try and get my refund processed. I can't help but understand why Sears is in such financial trouble. They just are not what they used to be.

Ghetto. Full of hood rats, drunks, homeless, etc. Bathrooms were disgusting. Most of the employees were 'busy' talking to friends? or texting on their cell phones. A lot of coffee choices were out.

Love this place! Authentic Japanese food and other items. They are a small shop, but have a nice selection and some other ethnic foods as well. (Hawaiian, Chinese, etc.) The staff is always courteous, friendly and willing to help. They won't try and sell you anything. Every time I ask for assistance, they always steer me to the most economical products that will accomplish my goals. A few days ago, I went in pick up some sake for cooking. The older lady (perhaps an owner) asked me if I liked the brand of sake I had chosen. I told her that I had never tried it, but it was for cooking. She recommended that I purchase a much cheaper, smaller bottle if I was cooking with it only and showed me her recommendation. ($2.49) I appreciate their honesty and integrity!

I continue to be astounded by the apathy displayed by businesses who spend big $$$ on advertising to get new patients, but do nothing to retain their current client base. We recently moved and being long time customers of VCA Apache Junction (LOVE THEM!), we decided to just transfer our animals care and their records to VCA Northern. BIG MISTAKE. Even though I called days in advance to make an appointment and have my records there for the new Vet, when I arrived this morning, they wanted me to fill out new paperwork with my name, address, blah, blah, blah REALLY? The whole point in us choosing a national chain was so that no matter where we were traveling, etc. they would have access to our record at a moments notice via computer. I guess that is not the case. Now, the one advantage I thought was present, is not. No reason to continue a relationship with VCA Northern.

If you know what you're looking for and can distinguish good from junk, you can pick up a good deal here many times. Just don't expect much in the way of customer service or "expert" advice, because there is little of both. Selection is pretty good most of the time, although they run out of advertised specials frequently.

Called to inquire about High Tea service as a gift for my wife and her sister as sort of a Sister's Date since she was coming from overseas. The people on the phone were so RUDE that I know now why they have such a poor rating. If you don't like customers and they are such a bother to you, why are you in business?

Probably the most pathetic example of "customer service" I have ever encountered. Took a weedeater in for repair. They said it might be under warranty, to which I replied fine if it is, fine if it isn't. I need it fixed, so fix it and if they pay for it fine, if not I will pay. Promised it would be done the next week. Several weeks go by and nothing. I call. "Oh, we haven't called to see if its under warranty yet." Really? I told them again, fix it, I don't care if I have to pay for it. Another week or so goes by and I call again. "Good news, its under warranty. Now, we can order the part and it should be here in 10-14 days." IDIOTS! Weeks go by again and I call. "It's ready" Really? Were you ever going to call and let me know, or just sit on it and wait? Went and picked it up. "Oh, its not under warranty." Paid $66 and left. They even repaired it with USED parts. NEVER AGAIN AND YELPERS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

Participated in a pickleball tournament here. The staff and people in general were kind, helpful and friendly. The pickleball courts are only a year or so old and are very nice. They have 16 outdoor courts in all. The only drawback here is that the facility is in the direct path of Luke Air Force base military jet flights and the noise is frequent and loud. Other than that, it's a winner.

My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here for the first time. I have nothing but good things to say. Food, wait staff and overall experience were excellent. This is an old school type of steakhouse with red velvet wallpaper, leather booths, etc. If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough. Give it a try and you'll be glad you did!

We had our first experience with Yard House in Hawaii and it was great. This location, not so much! My wife had the French Onion Soup which she described as bland, overly thick and just so-so overall. She also had the Ahi Tuna Salad which was equally as uninspiring. My Son had the Caesar Salad which literally had two croutons and some lettuce for $6.95. The Turkey Burger was overcooked and just kind of blah. I had the BBQ Ribs which were unusually tough and barely room temp. The creamed style corn was made with fresh corn. I know because mine was soupy, way too sweet and it was full of corn silks, corn husks and little pieces of corn cob! The BBQ Beans were way over-seasoned with cilantro? Just tasted bad! A GENUINE COLOSSAL DISAPPOINTMENT!

A friend and I tried Bobby Q for the first time a few days ago. Reception could use some additional training in customer service. I had the two meat combo plate with brisket and baby-back ribs recommended by our server ALEXANDRA, WHO WAS AWESOME!! Meat was delicious, tender and juicy. My sides were Mac N Cheese & grilled veggies, both which were also great. My friend had the prime rib and shrimp, which were also cooked perfectly and he enjoyed them a lot. Dessert was apple cobbler, which was also well done. Overall, a good experience. Portions are ample, but so are the prices. Dinner for two with drinks and tip was $85.

If you want GHETTO, this is the place. Went there only because it contains the closest Lenscrafters location & my son had to have glasses today. The mall itself is in a decent location but MANY stores are out of business. Lots of hood rats running through the mall yelling obscenities, playing grab ass etc. Food court is dismal. Some of the "restaurants" are run by quite the shady types with handwritten signs posted "CASH ONLY." Unless you absolutely positively have to have something from here, I WOULD AVOID this dump.

Our first time here, my wife went and picked up take-out. Wow, was I surprised at how good the food was and how ample the portions. The egg-rolls are like nothing I  have ever had before with big slices of chicken breast mushrooms, cabbage and who knows what else. We shared Mongolian chicken, Stir-fried Flounder filet and Assorted Vegetables (all which come with steamed rice as a combo for $7.95 each). Neither my wife, son, nor I could find fault with anything. Their sweet n sour sauce is not that red chemical reaction you get at most places, but a clear yellowish colored dream of a concoction. If your looking for a no-frills, inexpensive restaurant with great food, look no further. (see photos)

Tech said "it's no big deal, I'll just trim them". Uh, yeah it kinda is a big deal for me having to make another trip back because you were too busy texting one of your idiot friends to do your job.

An amazing bright spot in a DISMAL LOCATION (Metro Center Mall). Staff, especially manager, Sue was friendly and very helpful. We were able to get get my son's glasses in just under an hour as promised and they were spot on. There are a couple of other eyeglass places in this mall, but their selection doesn't seem to be quite as good. LensCrafters definitely has a larger selection of brand name and designer options. I am hoping they might move from this mall to a nicer location in the near future, but if not, I would return here because of my great experience with Sue. Thanks Sue!

Just joined, customer service is just OK. Facility is clean and very busy at peak times. Was told my membership included "towel service" but the girl at the front counter looked at me like I had three heads when I asked for one. She said they hadn't provided towels ever since she had worked there?? Racquetball was also listed as included in membership fees, but I had to pay extra to play in their racquetball "league".

There was hardly anyone there, but still had to wait forever to get assistance (just to pay) for a TV as I already knew what I wanted. Tons of staff talking, texting and shuffling merchandise from one place to another, but none could be bothered until I went to the "security" guy that stands at the door as you enter,,,,twice.

Same experience as Drew P. For some unknown reason they shipped my prescriptions to an address that had NEVER been associated with me. In fact, I had never even lived in that state? "Customer Service" was no help, and didn't care. Told me to "contact the post office and straighten it out." These idiots are now Express Scripts, but its the same incompetent idiots, just under a new moniker. I have REPEATEDLY told them not to send child proof caps and I just now received my latest refills. Yep, child proof caps. So here's what's going to happen. I am NOT paying the invoice for the medications. I am NOT using this "service" ever again. I am going to use my insurance card at retail pharmacies. My co-pay is a little more, but guess what. Cigna is going to have to pay LOTS more! And when they ask. I'll let them know exactly why.

First time here. Don't really have a problem with the food, it is just very average. The service was a little on the slow side, especially for such a SLOW night. There were literally only three tables inside with customers. The bar was a little busy, and therein lies the problem. This must be one of the last great frontiers for smokers. Although it is legal to smoke on an outside patio technically, what is not OK is to let the smoke and nasty smell waft in through the open doors constantly, ruining your quiet enjoyment of your meal. We will NOT be back.

Met a client here for lunch yesterday. We were seated promptly and our server, Katie, was great. My client had a burger and I ordered the scallops. Our lunches were out within 15 minutes and we snacked on the warm bread and butter while we chatted about business. This is a nice, little more upscale place to meet for lunch if you want an upgrade over the normal fast food type establishments. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the grilled zucchini was especially nice with a seasoning that I was not typical in other places that I have been. I also had the mac n cheese and it was obvious that it was freshly made. My client said that she really enjoyed her burger and sweet potato fries also. (maybe it was a little extra good because I was paying ;O)

5-1-14 Update***  I received a letter of apology today and a gift card. I will return and update my review based on our 2nd dining experience.  *******************************************************************************************************************    OK, so here we go again with a "split" review. Food, as far as taste goes, is a solid 3.5 stars. Like other Yelpers, to me its nothing more than an over priced Red Lobster with Cajun seasoning, much smaller portions and WAY TOO MANY FRIES to fill up the dead space on the plate. I have NEVER had people look at me strangely when I asked for Tabasco to accompany a dozen raw oysters on the half shell appetizer. But when they brought them out, I was in the restroom washing my hands. When I returned to the table, I did not see my server ASHLEIGH B (who was excellent in my opinion) around. I did see another server (ALEX) at one of the corner beverage stations not really doing anything and so I approached him and asked for Tabasco. Without looking up, he told me "You'll have to sit down and wait for your server." No, really, those were his exact words. Really? No problem, I went to the back of the restaurant to the main service line and asked someone else. Clearly, since I was not in his section and therefore he could not extract a tip from me by helping out, he decided to pass on a chance to display good customer service. Not excellent customer service, just good. So, ALEX, when you pull stunts like that you not only make yourself look unprofessional, but you also drag down your other servers and the restaurant you work for by reputation. If we ever come back and happen to be seated in your section, what do you think we will remember from this visit and how do you think we will feel about rewarding your service with a nice tip?

The wife & I finally got back to give these guys another try by using the gift cards they sent us in apology for our last experience. This time was much better. Our server, JENNIFER (a trainer) was awesome. Never wanted, needed or had to ask for anything. She was on top of her game! Food was hot, fresh and came out in a relatively quick amount of time. I had the fried shrimp & catfish filets again and my wife tried the Lobster & Crab salad. We were both happy. We also started with a lobster bisque which was just slightly on the salty side. I still think the portions are small in relation to price. I had 5 shrimp and 2 catfish filets ($25). Overall, a save on their part in customer retention.

Nice dog park and pretty well maintained. If you get there early in the a.m., before the homeless awake, it is a pretty nice park overall.

Other than the location (Christown Spectrum Mall), this store is a winner. We buy all our gas here as well. There is always a friendly attendant out by the pumps (not holed up in their little A/C "office") Easy access if you come in from Montebello and you don't have to wade through all the lot lizards and pan handlers usually present out front off of Bethany Home Rd. Store itself is clean and well organized. Staff is usually very helpful and attentive.

My FAVORITE Pho restaurant! Rare beef Pho is amazing and their broth has just a little something different from most of the Pho places I have tried. Way to go Pho Ao Sen! This place is a no brainer and a great place to take a date. Prices are reasonable, staff is friendly and the ambience is way better than your average strip mall Pho joint.

Why is it that Chick-fil-A seems to have great customer service at almost every location? Why can't the other fast food chains get it right like these guys? Friendly employees (none of which I saw using a cell phone on-duty), fast service and my order is always right. Keep it up Chick-fil-A, whatever you're doing is working! :O)

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! We used these guys strictly from my fellow Yelper's reviews. Camelback Moving was super professional from start to finish. They showed up on time, did what they promised, packed and moved our entire household without incident, AND CAME IN UNDER BUDGET!! It was so matter of fact, it was almost boring! How great is that? A BIG THANKS to our movers: ROBERT B, RICHARD M, ARNOLD S & RENE A! You guys are AWESOME!

If I could give NEGATIVE stars, I would. Went to downtown Glendale to do a little Mother's Day shopping. Saw a little sign advertising this place with an arrow pointing down an alley. That should have been my first clue. Walked in and it was, hot, damp and had a dank smell. Strike two. Two "employees" carrying on a conversation could not be bothered to look up or even acknowledge mine and my sons presence. Waited and waited....nothing. I'll bet $$$ the owner just can't understand why his or her business is failing. Clueless.

Our food here is usually decent, expensive for what you get, but decent However, this time I ordered the beef curry stew and it was DISGUSTING! Watered down broth and nothing but globs of fat and a few shreds of beef. The "manager" doesn't have a clue. Pathetic. None of us will return.

Took my wife here for dinner on Mother's Day and it was our first time. We were so pleased with every aspect. My wife had the raw oysters for her appetizer and even though they were relatively small, she said the taste was fantastic and she could tell that they were very fresh. I had the Surf N Turf for my appetizer which was amazing! The surf was scallops and the turf was braised short ribs that was removed from the bone and already pulled, much like what you would normally think of as pulled pork. The flavors were spot-on for everything. I enjoyed the scallops so much that I also chose them as my entree. Again, cooked to perfection! My wife had the Halibut, which is one of her favorite fish dishes. It was tender, juicy and flavorful. The spices used were not the ordinary variety that you would expect for halibut, but worked brilliantly. She is already asking when I'm going to take her back! =O)

Took my wife here for lunch after touring the new Mormon Temple. Great experience. Staff was friendly, efficient and attentive. I had the Miso Sea Bass which was cooked to perfection. It came with seasonal sautéed vegetables and pork fried rice, all which were excellent. My wife had the sushi sampler and was also well pleased with her choice. Sushi was fresh, well prepared and flavorful. This is a great choice!

Ended up stopping here on our way home from Glumdale. Just happened to see it while passing by and I'm glad we did! Even though it was just 11:30, as we approached, we noticed it was already getting busy. That's a good sign in my book. Interior is nothing fancy, just functional. Staff was friendly, fast and efficient in every way. My son had the Udon and sashimi and I opted for the tempura lunch special and Nigiri. Couldn't be more pleased with our meal. Prices were reasonable, sushi and Nigiri were fresh and not a problem did we encounter. We will be back! Thanks Guys!

A fairly good selection for a market this small. I'm not sure that I'm brave enough to purchase "fresh" fish, poultry or meat here however. Not dirty dirty, but not clean either. Produce is abysmal. You also will not receive any help here. You can ask for assistance, but the most I have ever gotten was an index finger pointing to "NUMBER 9!" (meaning the aisle number). I only go here because its close and I mainly buy only prepackaged items like Vietnamese coffee, spices, etc.

My wife's work had their Christmas party here last night. Although the customer service was slow and average at best, the food was outstanding. I had a burger and my wife the steak salad. I was the DD, but my wife said the margaritas were excellent. Dessert was tiramisu and sweet potato cheesecake. Great little place with a nice vibrant ambiance.

My wife just returned from here. First, they didn't want to do her nails because she didn't have an appointment (even though the place was more than half empty and 3 or 4 employees were surfing the web or texting on their cell phones). Ridiculous! They finally agreed and then did a CRAP job! Cut her cuticles until they bled. NEVER AGAIN! BEWARE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!

So this was our first time here tonight. The food is a solid 4 stars. The customer service however is a different matter. Young thug wannabes as servers complete with neck tattoos and "i don't care" attitudes. My wife ordered the beef Pho and was well pleased with all aspects of the tasty soup and lean beef. Plenty of garnish choices made for a nice meal for her. I ordered the #80 clay pot catfish. Again, taste wise, it was really good. Portion size however, was very small. Two pieces of catfish (not filet), some broth and a couple of stalks of green onion. After removing skin and bones, there actually was very little fish there. We ordered an additional catfish dish to take home to my son. When we got home, there were two half portions of rice in the bag. Nothing else. We went back and while they did apologize, the reason was "we are busy". Uh, yeah. Even though the food is quite tasty, the small portions, lack of customer service and "I don't care attitude" translates to WE WON'T BE BACK.

Came here to look for a new refrigerator for our new house. We purchased all of our appliances from Spencer's when we purchased our current home. Boy, has the customer service waned since we were last here. When we walked in there were at least eight employees behind the counter. Some were eating, some talking on their cell phone or texting and one was even on Craigslist looking at motorcycles. NOT ONE PERSON ACKNOWLEDGED OUR PRESENCE OR GREETED US! We will NOT be patronizing this chain.

Food is just OK, service is very slow and menu items are limited. There is actually not much real Filipino food on the menu. Centers around grilled items (chicken, beef, etc.) that has obviously been cooked before hand and reheated. I wouldn't eat here again unless it was the only restaurant in Mekong Plaza that was open and I was VERY hungry.

Greg came out to repair a roof leak in Nov 13. After assessing the situation, he told me that the area around our rooftop AC unit was improperly sealed. He said that he could seal it properly and guaranteed it would not leak anymore. He performed the work and we paid him. We have not had any appreciable amount of rain since the repair until last night. When we awoke this morning, we were astonished to see the same leak in the same place, except worse. And, it had caused some damage to the ceiling drywall. I have contacted Greg by email and requested that he stand behind his work by coming out and correctly performing the repairs. I have sent him photos, the original paid invoice and all of my contact information. I WILL AMEND THIS REVIEW WHEN HE RESPONDS AND POST THE OUTCOME OF OUR AGREEMENT. I am hopeful that he will live up to his statements here on his Yelp business page, proving that he cares about his customers satisfaction and he wants to do things the right way.  UPDATE: Greg responded to my email and has decided to take the LOW ROAD. This is obviously one of those uneducated types that have to take peoples money and give pathetic service in return. REFUSED TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. BEWARE Yelpers YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ABOUT THIS NOT HANDYMAN!!

First visit. Receptionist could benefit from some additional people skills training. Waited over one hour to see Dr Copeland, but was pleased with her. She took the time to listen and talk with us instead of rushing through the appointment. I don't mind waiting as much when the Dr takes time with you once he or she comes in the room. They do not have the capability to draw labs or take x-rays so you must go to two additional places to accomplish that, if needed.

Sort of a cluster at check-in. They are so scared they might lose a dollar that they RE-VERIFY your insurance by phone once you sign in. That's the main reason they want you to come in 30 minutes BEFORE your actual appointment. The front office is a flurry of people on hold with insurance companies trying to make sure that they get every cent that they can out of you. The MRI experience itself was not too bad. The "tech" asked me a bunch of medical questions that had nothing to do with my MRI. I guess it makes them feel  like their 6 week vocational training certificate makes them knowledgeable? An MRI screen requires TWO questions; 1. Do you have any metal in or on your body? and 2. Do you have any tattoos? (The tattoo question only really applies if it was done prior to the 90's when some inks actually had metallic particles in them, especially the greens and blues.)

OMG! This is the WORST "Chinese" food I have ever had! I tried the 2 item combo plate with sesame chicken and orange chicken. It came with lo-mein and a veggie egg roll. Both chicken items were OBVIOUSLY leftovers from another time. DISGUSTING. Egg roll was soggy and tasted weird and the lo-mein, which they called chow mien, but it wasn't, was barely warm and tasteless. Everything you touched inside the restaurant felt sticky and greasy. Took one bite of each item and there it all away.

If you go to the USPS website and try to reserve a PO Box at this location (which I did in March of 2013), it tells you there are none available, but if you sign up to be on the waiting list, they will email you when one is available and it's your turn. I waited and waited....an waited. So finally the other day I'm in this location mailing a package. The lady helps me, I pay and we're done. Right before I leave, I asked "I'm just curious, but does someone have to die before a P O Box becomes available here?" She informed me that they had plenty of boxes available. Really? I relayed the above information to her and she could not have cared less. I asked to speak to the P O Box policeman on duty (aka PO box clerk) and she said he had just left. It was 10:13 a.m. When I asked her "Do you ever wonder why the USPS loses a reported $25,000,000 per day?" She just looked confused. It's no secret that the USPS houses the least educated and most incompetent worker bees that they can, but this location provided the template for all of their guides on how to attract the most worthless employees you can find. MICHELLE is just an outright BITCH. As simple as delivering an envelope is (a trained monkey could do a better job than these clowns) they manage to screw it up 9 out of 10 times. PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE. As BAD as it gets. You have been warned.

Received a gift card from a friend to 13 N since it was one of their local favorites. My wife and I went here for our first time and were well pleased. There is a nice kind of local bar/pub/grill vibe going on and they have some pretty great daily specials. A nice selection of $13 bottles of wine was on the board as well as $5 burgers and other dishes. My wife had the Cobb salad with grilled chicken and I had the lobster mac n cheese. Both were excellent and the portions were on the larger side. My wife enjoyed it so much, she took our son back there the next day. We will be back!

After my review, I was contacted by the owner. He genuinely seemed to care about my poor experience. He invited me back to give them another chance to earn my business. I noticed that there had been some staff changes and that the service was much improved over past experiences. I have never had a problem with the quality of their work, just the staff. That now seems to be fixed and I will continue to frequent this location as long as good customer service prevails.

After construction of a new driveway and shop in the backyard, my sprinkler system was a big hot mess. Sprinkler Doctors came out and got everything repaired, replaced and reprogrammed quickly and at a fair price. Thanks for a job well done. I'm hanging on to your number for any future needs I might have!

First time diners here. My wife ordered the grilled Ahi Tuna sandwich and really enjoyed it. I ordered the Char 1 with sweet potato fries. The burger was good, but not great. I can't really pinpoint any difference from other burger places like In & Out, Culver's, etc. It was certainly good, but I just didn't notice anything that made it special. The sweet potato fries were also good, but again, nothing that you can't get at other burger joints. The restaurant was very clean and the staff were courteous and friendly. Wait time for food was average.

I really wanted to like this place more. Chicken fingers were excellent. The problem lies in everything else. There are only four choices on the menu and all are just variations of the same thing. No salads and only one sandwich. The french fries are nothing more than the crinkle cut type you find in the frozen food section of any supermarket. I guess the biggest WTF? came when they told me there was only TWO sauce choices for the chicken fingers...their house sauce and honey mustard??? Really? No BBQ? No sweet n sour? No ranch? No buffalo....etc.

Went here for lunch around 1:30 and it looked to me as if the food was mostly the same since opening. You could tell that it was not fresh and several things were out and never replaced during our visit. This place works off of volume, sort of the WalMart of Americanized Chinese poorly done food. Will not be back.

Says they have 24hr automated postal service. Perhaps they do, but you would have to make it past the locked doors after hours to find out. Staff is typical USPS...rude, don't care attitude and doing as little as possible to be helpful. I bet they wonder why the USPS loses an approximated $25 MILLION dollars a day. I hope the USPS goes BANKRUPT and every single one of them lose their job.

Happened to be in the vicinity and stopped in to check things out. This is a large place and I was pleasantly surprised with the prices. Most "antique dealers" are overpriced to the extreme. I didn't find this to be the case here. I thought most of the prices were reasonable and fair. Didn't find anything I had to have but the selection was good and the staff were all polite. Next time I'm in the area, I'll stop in again.

Even though I have done my own taxes and taxes for others for many years, we had a special situation come up this year that required a deeper knowledge than I possess. I met with Wanda and really felt comfortable with her assessment of our situation and recommendations. I didn't feel rushed and we sat in her office and discussed the matter until I felt comfortable with our plan. I cannot recommend Wanda highly enough!

My fellow Yelpers didn't let me down on this one. Got my new truck windows done here and I am well pleased. Chris helped me out start to finish and answered all my questions. Never pushy or tried to upsell me and I really appreciate that in a professional business. Showed me all my options and they had a range of options and price points. I don't think you can go wrong by coming here. These guys will be here when Leroy at the carwash and Jose's mobile car tint and meat products are long gone! If you want professionals, this is the place! Thanks Chris!

First experience with Allegiant. Everything went exceedingly well as far as I'm concerned. No issues and being able to select an Exit Row seat for $13 extra at time of ticket purchase to me is by far the biggest advantage to this airline. The leg room on their exit row 24 is way more than even a first class seat with other airlines. I AM A BIG FAN!

I guess we had been "built-up" too much for this new restaurant on Greenfield in Mesa. There was TONS of teenage help, but the service was SLOW for as many staff as they had. My son wanted something else after he tried the Pot Roast sandwich, but when he ordered, it was wrong TWICE. I had to go up and find a "Manager" who looked to be at least one year older than the rest to try and straighten it out. It took some time to get it right, but finally they wrapped their heads around it. A LARGE amount of grab-ass was going on between the girls and boys and the young man handling our food kept throwing it in the window and then retrieving it again, just to give it a harder toss to see if he could get the lid of the contained to pop open??? If you don't expect much, you probably won't be disappointed. Very standard fast food and service. The sides on my 2 pc cod dinner were cold and not appealing at all. We didn't get ice cream, but hear that it is good. Maybe next time.

Tried again in vain to patronize the Fletcher Tire & Auto organization. Called to make an appointment and once again, at this location was asked when I wanted to come in and then told sorry, can't do it. It was 2 days in advance! They tried to give me some BS about we take appointments some times and sometimes we don't??? This was the LAST STRAW! BEWARE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ABOUT THESE JERKS!

Service is horrible. Pick-up was just ok, but vehicle was filthy and had trash in it. Attendant was same at pick-up and turn-in. She was dismissive and curt. Was visibly and audibly upset when I made her walk to the car at check-in and physically inspect the car for cleanliness, damage and a full tank. WARNING, YOU GET NO DOCUMENTATION OF ANY KIND AT TURN-IN. They just tell you you will get the final rental bill by email within 24 hrs. NEVER AGAIN WILL I RENT HERE!

We tried this new place in the Superstition Springs Mall Food Court. Even though we ate close to closing time, all of the food looked very fresh. We enjoyed the beef and lamb gyros as well as the salads and the yellow rice was very nicely seasoned with saffron. We will definitely be going back SOON!

My wife and I met some friends here for drinks and appetizers. The vibe is more of a look at me, I'm so cool thats why I'm talking so loud feel. Had the house margarita but really wasn't too impressed. You can get better for less elsewhere. Also had the pretzel bread with cheese fondue. Cheese was just luke warm but the bread was tasty. The noise level was kind of off putting. Free valet parking is available. There are some other restaurants at the same location but never could figure out where they actually were, are they just three different types of food at same place? Confusing. All in all food was average as was the staff and service. Probably won't return.

New owners and used to go by Pho Ao Sen. Interior is the same, staff is different and in my opinion not as friendly. Pho broth is a step down from before and not nearly as flavorful. I think these guys are trying to do to much by offering Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese and Vegetarian. Get Vietnamese right first, then maybe try and expand your menu.

My wife and I went here for the first time on Super Bowl Sunday. Expecting it to be crowded, we were pleasantly surprised that there were only 8-10 people in the whole restaurant. We were seated immediately and our server brought water and warm bread with plain olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar. No spices, just oil and vinegar. The bread was tasty, but the vinegar overpowered the plain olive oil. We ordered and the food came out relatively fast. I had the Chicken Marsala with fresh seasonal vegetables. The chicken was way overcooked and the vegetables were actually burnt, black and crispy. There was no marsala sauce and everything was over salted. My wife had the flank steak salad, which is described as med-med well doneness on the menu. It was very well done also. She described the dressing as watery and fairly tasteless. I was so disappointed in the food after watching this place go up over the last months. I was hoping for something hip and casual in the Italian market to add to our minimal choices this far out in the E Valley......sadly that is not the case. The building is a modern design and they have a wonderful patio. I hop that they can hire a better cook, because if they don't, I'm afraid they will not be around very long. And $10 Italian margaritas?? Come on!

A little conflicted here. The food was a solid four stars. The portions were ample and the taste was spot on. The "service" on the other hand is non-existent. My server was unfriendly and hurried. Not the normal all business type that you usually get in Asian restaurants, but just plain horrible at his job. Came up to the table and just stood there looking out the window...not a word to me, just stood there. You can get the same good food elsewhere with better service and cheaper prices. Don't bother here.

Overall a good first experience. Our server was not very familiar with the menu and was unable to answer our questions without retreating to the sushi bar area where she could ask someone that knew. The food was good and came out in an acceptable amount of time. Sushi was fresh and portions were good in relation to price. It's a little far from where we live and we probably would not make the trip just to eat here. If we were in the area, it might be different.

I was so excited as this place was "remodeling" an old iHop building to open this Thai restaurant. My wife and son ate there tonight and brought me one of my favorite dishes, Thai Beef Salad. When done right, its awesome. Unfortunately here it was NOT DONE RIGHT. The menus ays it has "rice powder" on it, but mine came with the strangest bits of what tasted like burnt broken rice. It was AWFUL. My wife and son also did not enjoy their meals. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND PASS THIS ONE BY! Oh, and BTW THAI LOTUS, DO YOU REALLY THINK ANYONE BELIEVES YOUR TWO 5 STAR REVIEWS, ONE DAY APART From "Wes J" & Greg L"?   SAD

This is the new name for the old Big Heng restaurant. From what I hear, the new owners are from New York and have a long history in the business. It shows. I loved Big Heng and I love Dragon Chinese even MORE! Food is always fresh and portion size is good. The menu is much larger and has added new items like lamb and prawns. A markedly Hunan influence is evident, but spiciness was spot on with each dish we ordered. I am a wimp and get one star but my wife and son are full on wackadoodle and get the full monty 5 star level every time. Cudos guys and welcome to the neighborhood!

I guess I was judging by the name and expecting more international choices. Really strong selection of Indian foods. No Asian, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, etc. that I saw. If your looking for Indian food however, this place has more choices than any other international market that I have seen. Nice, clean, well lit.

Typical $$$ centered "practice". The Wal-Mart of healthcare if you will WITHOUT the low prices. They only hire the least educated staff they can find apparently. Rude, no one is ever available, physician's won't return your call or speak with you unless you are there in front of them and they have no other choice. Can't even seem to get prescriptions called in correctly. Always have to leave a message and then it takes DAYS for them to respond. So, Arrowhead Health Centers, you are hereby TERMINATED! You are PATHETIC!

Was asked several times if I was OK or needed any help as I browsed. Overall, very good first experience here.

I was glad to see what I thought was a new Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. The Thai food options are a little limited with standards like Tom Yum Soup, Thai Beef Salad and Pad See Yew missing from the menu. Noted under it's name is the description "southeast asian kitchen." There are some clearly Chinese choices like Pork Pot Stickers and Sizzling Green Bean(s),  as well as Vietnamese Pho and Bun Bo. But there are also some less Asian sounding at least dishes like Sweet Potato Fries and Chicken Lollipops. They have made an obvious attempt to make this place a little more "hip" by including a huge bar and some upgraded interior design ideas versus your normal Asian decor. It seemed funny that with the enormity of the bar, we were never offered any alcoholic beverages or anything other than water for that matter. We started with the Shrimp Spring Rolls (fresh not fried) and were well pleased. The dipping sauce was spicy, sweet and had a hint of sour. Yummy! My wife had the Thai Salad with tofu and was pleased with her choice. According to her, it was spicy and she enjoyed it. I opted for the Yellow Curry with chicken and I too was pleased. The curry was the right amount of spicy and was full of ingredients that you don't normally get above the standard potatoes, onions and carrots. Mine also had baby corn, sweet potatoes, pineapple, snow peas and green bell peppers. I thought the sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes was a great choice. There was no dessert menu, but our server told us that they had Goat & Cream Cheese wontons with Strawberry puree and sprinkled with powdered sugar or Strawberry Cheesecake. No brainer right? The wontons were excellent. BUT, you only get two wontons just larger than a quarter for $5.00? Really? Although I'm not sure that Red Thai will ever be able to utilize it's ginormous bar, I hope that they will concentrate on refining the menu and ultimately improve. I know restaurant openings can be cumbersome and fret with "bugs" but I sincerely hope they will iron out the kinks and remain a viable option. I think cutting the bar way down and adding some additional seating would help the process immensely. (see pics)

I was surprised that this location has changed hands yet again. The "new owners" told my wife (in Chinese because she is Chinese) that they didn't know where the old owners went??? Right. Anyway, the food is not really bad, but it is much more traditional Chinese food instead of the Americanized version most of us are accustomed to. (White Fungus Tofu Soup, Yu Fu, Bitter Melon, etc.) The portions are definitely smaller and the prices are considerably higher. The menu I was given, I hope, is just a transitional menu and the real ones are at the printers as we speak. I say this because there are no appetizers like egg rolls, won ton soup, etc at all on the menu I saw. Also there are no combination plates or lunch specials that I could see. The old restaurant had a better selection, lower prices and bigger portions yet still could not make it. I feel certain these guys won't be around for very long either. I doubt we will return.

Came home last night and closed the garage door......BANG!, broken spring. Went straight to Yelp for guidance. Some of the other guys have more reviews, but when you look, there are too many 0 friends, 1-3 reviews there. Suspect to me. Apex looked like a smaller, more personal company and indeed they are. Scheduled online last night for this morning at 8 a.m. Appointment was confirmed electronically. This morning, Zach called me about 15 minutes out and showed up exactly on time. Inspected my system and told me how much the repair would be. DID NOT TRY TO "UPSELL" ME. ( I figured while he was here, I would ask him to replace the stock rollers with larger, higher quality ones). Zach inspected, repaired, replaced both springs with heavier duty ones at my request, lubricated and adjusted everything. Whole process was about an hour. Zach was courteous, respectful and professional. Apex will be the ONLY company I call in the future! Oh, and they have a 5 YEAR WARRANTY on their work! Thanks Zach!

Yelpers, if you haven't been here, YOU NEED TO GO! Small place, seats maybe 20? Owner is Italian and this is without a doubt the best bread I have ever had in my life. Lived in Europe for 2 years and this is authentic. This is craftsman, artisan bread. This is NOT the crap you buy in the "bakery dept" of a grocery store. They only serve lunch and there is no menu. The menu is written on a chalkboard to your right as you walk in and changes daily. There is ALWAYS a vegetarian option or two. My wife and I had lunch here today. REAL homemade cold cuts, real homemade mozzarella cheese and of course the BREAD...OMG the bread! I had an apple roasted ham, mozzarella and greens sandwich and my wife had the vegetarian sandwich. Roasted peppers, greens and more that she loved. Can you tell I'm not interested in vegetables? Anyway, this place is the real deal, so do yourself a favor and give them a try. You won't be disappointed!

Wife and I went to the Pho place next door for lunch and when done, she stopped in here for a manicure only to get a "feel" for the place and see their performance level. Can't speak for the entire staff, but Katie impressed my wife with her skills. Her manicure was thorough and very well done. Cuticles taken care of with no discomfort and laser like precision. Hand massage was "awesome" according to my happy wife. I believe this will be her new go-to nail salon.

1st time here and I must say the food was really good. Beef Pho can be ordered with "tender and rare beef" which is beef like found in most other pho places, but the "tender" beef is thick slices of really tender roast beef like meat. Very yummy! Spring rolls were awesome and full of ingredients. A few things to work on: temperature in dining area was too warm, soda machine was down so no Coke products and like some other pho shops they water down the sriracha & hoisin sauce, but here they went a little too far with the water. Family owned and operated, they were very nice and helpful. I will be back!

For a new restaurant, I was really disappointed in this place. Customer service was very underwhelming. Restaurant itself is new, but kind of an odd mish-mash of furnishings that look like maybe everything was purchased from a liquidation business and then pieced together haphazardly? They have a stage? an espresso machine sitting in the corner seating area? and a sound system for karaoke? The pho broth (what I judge every pho place by) was just mediocre at best. Spring rolls were OK, but tiny in comparison to other establishments. I ordered grilled pork with broken rice and then told they didn't have broken rice. Seriously? A Vietnamese restaurant without broken rice? The steamed rice they did serve was way undercooked. The male staff spent most of their time outside the front doors smoking. We will not be back.

I had very low expectations from a mall food court Pho shop. Boy was I wrong! I judge all Pho on the broth and this broth is excellent. Better than many sit-down restaurants I have frequented in the past. Another outstanding feature of the Pho Tai is the beef. It is real, thickly cut and tasty. Many shops have paper thin slices but not here. (see photo) This is a mom and pop shop that reminds me of my time in Saigon. Do yourself a favor and give them a try. You'll be glad you did!
