For the record: I'm just not that into salmonella.   We hit this place on a Wed after work for some snacks and a beer. We needed a fun place to go to fairly quickly because we have a little one that hits the sack early.   It was still happy hour -it goes until 7, so that goes in the plus column, so we ordered quesadillas ($4 on hh menu) and a cobb salad to share. The quesadillas were really only worth about $4- two of the pieces had nothing but cheese in them. The two pieces in the middle had some tomatoes, green onions and black beans. Definitely not worth the more than $4 they normally are.   Then, our salad showed up with chicken that was completely raw in the middle. All the way through every slice- RAW, PINK, JELLY. We sent it back and the server was pretty apologetic.   When it arrived, the manager brought it and literally all he was was, "Sorry," and dropped it off at the table. Maybe I'm a snob, but if I had almost made an entire family  seriously ill, I would have offered to pay for the salad.   We will probably skip this place and just hit Four Peaks from here on out.

i just had to take my 2 year old tsx in because it didn't want to start. i called up, made an appointment, and asked if they had wi fi. they sure did.  i showed up for my appointment, someone met me at my car in the service car port. he walked me inside and confirmed what i was there for.   someone had noted that i asked about wi fi, and after we talked about hwo they were going to inspect the car, he walked me over to where they had cubbies with power outlets and asked if i would like to use their free wi fi there, so i could work in private. he also said they had a lounge with free food and drinks, if i'd rather go that route. i took the cubby because i needed the power outlet.  it took an hour and a half total. he came back to find me once, to let me know the battery was done and they were going to replace it. he also showed me the results of my inspection, and asked if i had time to wait while the washed it. sure i did. i was basically at work.  anyway, the whole experience was great: i didn't waste any time there, and i got an incredible car wash- inside and out.   easiest trip for getting a car worked on i've ever had.

they lied.  the tacos were not half price, even though that is what it said on the wall AND on the menu. nope. we were charged full price and 6 little tacos, although tasty, are not worth $15.   when i asked the bartender what the deal was, he said they got rid of that deal. i pointed to the wall, and he says, "yeah, i know." and that was it.   plus, a fight broke out behind us and it wasn't even 8pm (we were there for happy hour). entertaining if they would have let it go on, but the guys were so drunk they could barely swing. (heavy on the sarcasm).  we used to go here a bunch a few years ago, but now it's just bad cougars and people that like to fight. awesome for some, but not for me.

I give the food 4 stars and the service a three. Yes, my coffee was always full and my food was great, but is a smile that much to ask for at 8am? I guess I forgot I was in Scottsdale.  I'm the first to admit that mornings are not my cup of tea so I don't expect much from anyone else at the start of the day.   However, if I'm paying you to be nice to be, then be nice to me. I don't care what hour of the day it is.  Aside from the totally aloof service, the food was incredible as usual. I had the fried egg sandwich and it was everything and more I expected. High quality products made a typical sandwich into an extraordinary one. The coffee was great, as well.   I'll go back because the food is so good. I just don't get how you could care less that people want to be there and eat your food.

if you like crunchy crust, you'll love-a da grazi!  the first time i went there, was on a date with my now husband, and my head was turning the whole night because i'm pretty sure at that point, they had imported some of the prettiest people in italy and forced them to work there. for real. anyway, never had a bad pizza or salad here. i love my crust crunchy and i'm never disappointed (unlike LGO's soggy-pizza-center-issue). if you really want to go all out, order the calzone for dessert: huge and filled with bananas and nutella and cooked in the oven. (me: we can't eat all this! 10 minutes later, me: i can't believe we ate all that.) hit up the patio for a killer place to eat outside in scottsdale, without feeling like you're outside in scottsdale, aka on a bad runway where the models only look like tara reid.

more like sugar deaddy's.  this place slid and slid fast. when i moved here 5 years ago, it was a great place to grab some beers outside on the patio. on a thursday thru saturday night, you'd actually have a hard time finding a parking spot.  now, it's like driving by a cemetery. after the tax deal, then all the fights that happen there, you couldn't pay me to go to that place. ghost town would be how i'd describe it. so, i will. it's a ghost town.  total waste of a great place. put a fork in it.

this place is one of our favorites. the inside is fairly lame, but the patio is perfect. i always get the carne seca (or is it seca? i always get them confused) plate and i'm never disappointed. spicy enough it makes my nose run and loads of flavor. the service has always been on-it; i've never been left hanging with a burning mouth and no cold beer. i've never tried the "american" fare on the menu, their new mexican food is just too good.

the coach house, where it's christmas almost year round.  there are two things i absolutely love about this place: 1. there are ALWAYS people here. even at 8am on a weekday.  2. when they decorate for the holidays, it's like a cross between the griswold's and the inside of a pinball machine.   in case you need a bar to hit at 8am (and sometimes you do), this is the one to hit. you walk in, and immediately lose all shame/weirdness/insecurity about actually being in a bar at 8am on a weekday.   i did this once (what? we had been up since 4am, hanging hwy banners on the east side), and i was not disappointed. my friend and i walked in and were promptly met by four guys that were obviously still out from the night before. they were so bombed, they were betting $20 against each other, playing Rock-Scissors-Paper. they then wanted to gamble on my friend and i playing it, which we quickly balked, but decided to do it when they said whomever won could keep the money. (yes, we were RSP whores that morning).   my friend won us $40, so, in short, we actually made money by hitting up the Coach House at 8am on a weekday morning.  secondly, if you haven't seen this place in all it's holiday decor glory, you truly haven't seen the beauty of Coach House. it is, in a word, BLINDING. and awesome. there's so much in such a small space, that when you walk in, the first five minutes are really spent just seeing fuzzy pink. it's incredible.   i also saw people eat it on their bikes, drunk bicycling thru the parking lot there one evening.   you just never know what you're going to get, but you're certainly not going to pay much to get it or get it anywhere else.

it's been a while since the one and only time i went here, but it deserves a review, simply because of what happened there.  we were well on our way to having a hang over the next day, which seems like the only way to go to this bar.   we walked in (group of 6), and managed to find a table, inside, where the karaoke was happening. we're not that into karaoke, but it is free entertainment.  as soon as we sat down, a woman started singing. she was pretty decent and the song was a crowd pleaser. then it happened.  some dude, about 5'2" gets up on stage, and starts dancing at her, while she's singing. i say at, because she was not dancing. no one was. except this guy, who was also in his mid-40s and sporting a sweet comb-over. it was seriously like someone planted him as a prank, like we were being taped for a surprise tv show.   we all sat there looking at each other, then looking at him, then back at each other. the lady was a trooper, she just kept singing. finally, the song was over, and he opened his arms up, like he was going to hug her. finally, some other guy from the audience, pulled him away, back down to his seat. very awkwardly.   that's not why i'm giving this 2 starts. we were there a good 15 minutes total, and never saw a server. more beer might have saved the situation, in some way. with no beer in sight, we bolted. we couldn't handle another episode like that, with nothing to wash it down with.

I stand out when I go, because I don't reek of burnt skin from the tanning bed across the street.  I only go to this gym because it's close enough to hit in the mornings and I can ride my bike there. That's where the fun stops.  Here are my beefs: 1. Not enough cardio equip if you're going to let 1/4 of the machines be out of order every day. 2. Hiding the free weights isn't a fun game. They are never stacked where they're supposed to be. I always have to hunt around and sometimes never find the ones I need. c. They have been missing three different medicine balls for more than 6 months, now. I asked about them, three different times and was told that they were in the gym, I just had to look. Liar, liar, pants on fire.  4. If you go past 3p on any day, it looks like what is has to be like walking into Axis Radius on a Saturday night (not that I've ever been bored or drunk enough to know). Meat-heads gallore, complete with spiked hair, fixed around their ban-danas and barbed wire tats around their arms. Also, their chicks wear outfits so ridonkulous that Michael Phelps would be embarrassed at the amount of skin showing. 5. Fat trainers.   Other than that, it's awesome.

i love it because i can wear flip-flops, a t-shirt, jeans, sit outside and drink good beer.   super easy going and a huge patio make it a favorite of mine.   as a bonus, the food is really good, too. between the hummus and pita, quesadillas, and spinach salad, you've got a lot of great options.   surprisingly enough, even when it's packed (which it is on any nice weekend day or a friday after work), i've still had great service.   try the sunbrau instead of kiltlifter next time to change it up. you won't be disappointed.

I thought this was a decent sports bar, so I met my husband and some friends here for lunch on the Friday of the first round of the NCAA tournament. We were the only table of people inside and there were maybe 10 other people in the entire place. Including an handful of old (50+) men that hugged all of the waitresses WAY too long. They lingered. Anyway, our server was awful. I've been a server at different points in my life, and I have no problem calling out the ones that suck. She was worthless. No one got water more than once and the drinks sat empty for 15-20 minutes at time.  The food was pathetic. I'm 6.5 months pregnant and will eat just about anything you put in front of me...but I didn't want to eat any of the tacos I ordered. $12 for three TINY tacos that had zero meat on the inside and what little food there was in them tasted like crud. Also, apparently the dish comes with rice and beans...which come on their own gigantic plate. Since no one ate theirs, because it was so bad, the plates of rice and beans sat there the entire time we were there. Even after our other plates were cleared, the freaking beans and rice would not go away. She just kept leaving them there, apparently in case we got some cravings for black beans with beers, after the beans had been sitting there for half an hour. After waiting for 20 minutes or so just to see our server to get our check, we finally just went to the bar to pay. When our server returned with our cards, she apologized that she wasn't around. She said she'd told her boss that she felt like she was getting sick and thought he was going to take care of the check. Super glad this one was serving us drinks and food all afternoon, especially to a pregnant chick, if she feels like crap. That was the first and last time I'll ever go there. Way too many great places in this area to get great food from servers who aren't going to give you herpes. Which is what I'm 99% sure she was coming down with.

Artlink saved First Fridays.   I used to hit First Fridays every once in a while because I liked it, but couldn't deal with all of the random junk people were selling along Roosevelt. Now, not only do I love First Fridays, but I've been a vendor at each one since June and will continue to be.   They have created a great environment for the crowd and cleaned up the vending so it's actually fun to cruise through. It's the most culture you'll find in the Valley in one night and there's something different each month. It's a great excuse to explore a part of the city that's really coming around and support local businesses at the same time.   Next time you go to First Fridays, stop by the Durtbagz booth and say "hi"!  If you haven't been to any of the local bars around First Fridays, you're really missing out.   Thanks Artlink!

okay, i finally know the name of this place. i think it used to have different owners when it originally opened.   i live 5 minutes from here (you know, on the other side of the tracks) and have been going here since it opened a few years ago. the quality of coffee drinks has gone up and up and up since the first time we tried it.   i love their lattes as well as their plain old cup of joe. the service has always been great; typically my dog gets a treat if she's riding along with me through the drive-thru.   great coffee, nice, local spot to support.

just hit this place the other night before our First Fridays committee meeting and in a word: supercalifragilisticespalidocious.  my carmel latte was so, so great, and having been a barista in a former life, i'm a tough customer.   the atmosphere is perfect for work or play. wide open, big tables inside and a big patio in the back, with a fountain. (yes, you can cut through the parking garage and come in the back, instead of walking the whole way around like an idiot...like i might have done.)  the pricing is right for their beverages and aside from being involved in fair trade, they also like the environment. they've got a spot for you to put your sleeves to be used again. brilliant.  the only reason i'm giving it four instead of five stars is because i had to go to the bathroom really badly and i couldn't use it because someone was in it for a good 20 minutes while i was waiting and i had to wait even longer and use it at the next place because i was scared to go in, at that point. not their fault.

I had the "waffle and meat" and I got some killer waffle and meat.  First for the food.   Usually belgian waffles are so heavy that you take four bites and you're done. Even for an eater like me, they are tough to put away. My waffle here was light and I ate the entire thing. Bonus: didn't feel like a tub o'lard after, either. Was just-right kind of full. The meat I picked was ham and I love that I got a big, thick slice of it. Lots of flavor, not lots of grease. Sweet and salty magic, is basically what my plate was.  My dad had the pancakes with fruit. Same thing: light and fluffy. He put his away, and he and I are about the same size. Yeah, shut up.  The cool part, other than our great breakfasts, was the setting. Living in a gigantor city, it was really nice to be able to go a place and feel like you're somewhere else. Being on a farm isn't something you get to do every day, here, and it was kind of a fun adventure.   I'll be back for breakfast, fo sho.

If you like cupcakes with zero taste, but tons of frosting AND being treated like you're not good enough to be there, then this is the place for you. My husband and I went there today, and we probably won't go again. First off, their selection of flavors is pretty small, especially compared to LuLu's, down on McDowell. When I asked what the "Momo" flavor was, she rattled off something quickly, and then said, "Look up on the board. All of our flavors are listed there." I'm pregnant and I thought I might have been having an irrational moment, because I thought that was rude. As soon as we walked outside, my normally uber calm husband says, "If you don't want to explain to someone one flavor of your cupcakes, maybe you shouldn't have a cupcake shop. That girl was a batch." (spelled correctly). I couldn't agree more.  And my cupcake was lame, to boot. The 4lbs of icing were just okay, and the cake part was super bland. For $3.50, I expect a lot more flavor and a lot less attitude. Disappointing.

been here twice and probably won't go back, unless i only have margaritas. the food was great the first time and very sub-par the second, especially for the price of the tacos. the pork ones were especially gross; extremely greasy and fatty and tasteless (i know pork is fatty, but it shouldn't be hard to chew).   our service was good the first go round, as we sat at the bar and learned a lot from the bartender about their tequilas. the second time, service was no good. very slow and our waters went empty for entire meal, even after we asked for more.   they do have great guac and chips and their margaritas are fantastic, and they should be for what you pay. but if you are looking for great tacos, skip this place. you'll be underwhelmed.

I just tried this place for the first time on Monday, as a place to work and get out of the house. Immediately when I walked in, I was afraid I wasn't cool enough to be there. I confirmed this when I shot the liquid sugar across my latte and all over the counter.  The redeeming quality of Cartel is the barista working responded with, "I shot myself in the face with that, last week." Making yourself more embarrassing than your clients? Point Cartel. The latte was really good, pretty strong, and tasted really good. The free wifi didn't hurt, and although I know I wasn't really cool enough to be there (I'm pretty sure I was one of 3 people that wasn't wearing clothes they made), it was just what I was looking for. Quiet, but not dull, and good coffee.  Oh, and when I was leaving, the barista said "Sweet bag!" (Mine, that I design and sell). Yep okay. I'll be back.

the rustica looks like a penis.  thankfully, it tastes like pizza. super thin, crunchy crust pizza.   the husband and i went for lunch to the one in scottsdale, the other day. we shared a spinach salad and each had some pizza. the salad was very good and plenty for two people to share.   i had the appropriately called "meat" rustica and it was really good. this is the only the second place in phx i've had pizza that doesn't make me feel like i splashed my face in grease after. (grazi is the other).   the husband had two slices, which were more than plenty for a meal. they were completely different styles of pie and both were great.   we'll definitely hit this one again.

In a word: run for your effing life.  After reading the review on it in the New Times, we decided to hit this place with some friends. It was the first time for all of us, and to be fair, we are not of the "Scottsdale" scene and that was definitely part of the problem.  I'll make this simple: Issue #1: Made reservations for 8:30 and even though almost every table was open, we couldn't be seated for a good 15 minutes. Issue #2: Um, is this place a restaurant or a dance club? A DJ fired up at 9p and it wasn't music you could ignore. It was like eating in "Trainspotting". Issue #3: Gigantic, pointy rock in the middle of the "dance floor" Issue #4: $12 for four TINY SLIVERS of tuna that wouldn't make an anorexic full. Issue #5: Over an hour to get our meals, which were served one at a time, apparently whenever they were ready. Issue #6: Did I mention there was a DJ? Issue #7: The crowd was of the Paris Hilton type, which I was expecting, considering. However, my friend summed it up perfectly, when she said, "This is the kind of place where you can see a 40 year old puking in the bathroom around 10pm." Well done, my friend. Issue #8: The service: horrendous. Our server actually admitted to us that the kitchen crew was hammered because they'd been at the Scottsdale Culinary Fest all day. I'm sure they remembered to wash their hands, though.   Other than that, it was fine.

Wowee wow wow. I'm not a huge fan of Italian because to me, unless it's done really well, it's pretty terrible.   This is the best Italian food I've ever had, and the service wasn't far behind.   I found this place for my folks and our little one when they were visiting and wanted Italian. We hit it based on the Yelp reviews and the reviews are right on.   1. Service = A+. Greeted at the door and treated like long, lost, welcome family. Our server, John, described the specials so well, that you could basically see them in front of you. Our drinks were never close to being empty, but John never hovered or smothered us. Just very on top of things. 2. The food. Seriously, the food. The special appetizer was one of the best things I've ever eaten- I hope they add it to the menu. We all had something different: calamari marinara, gnocchi marinara, cheese ravioli (for the little one), and one of the specials. Everybody was raving about the flavors- nothing was heavy or overdone. It was all just so tasty and we all ended up taking some home. (BTW, they labeled our take home packages, which was helpful for dividing it up later- my folks wouldn't leave theirs with us because it was too good. They put it on ice and took it back to Tucson with them.) 3. Price- very affordable. For the quality of food you get and the amount, you seriously can't beat it.   The ambiance is not what you go for, but the food and service more than make up for it and it is very family friendly. We all agreed how excited we were to have found this place and how pumped we are to go back.

I've been here multiple times and we've also had take out a few different nights. The quality of the food and the service just keeps being amazing. It almost feels too good to be true- like something will give at some point...but it never does.   Each time we eat there, we like to hit the patio to watch the planes, otherwise you definitely need a reservation. The flavors, the quality of the ingredients and the creativity of the dishes make this place shine. Try it all- it's all good. And if there are still specials available that evening, order them! If they bottled their marinara, I'd buy it.   I used to think I wasn't that into Italian food and then I ate here and realized I'd just been settling for poor quality/cheesy/greasy grossness that was labeled Italian. Eat here; it will change your definition of good Italian food.

i only agreed to eat here after reading yelp reviews.  we live about a mile from this place, and i never wanted to go there because i don't trust anything in that strip center. however, after reading other yelpers reviews, i trusted that i wouldn't find a hunk of cat in my pad thai. and i was right.  i actually had the yellow curry noodles with shrimp and the husband had pad thai. both were incredible and mine was plenty spicy at medium.   i love curry and i wasn't disappointed; i would only like there to be a few more big hunks of veggies in it, rather than tons of sliced onions. that's why i only gave it four stars. if there had been more variety in veggies, then it would have been perfect.   for $19.95 for both and with plenty left over, you can't beat it. we did carry-out and it was ready in 10 minutes, like they said. i don't know where this place came from (don't say Thailand), but it's great and i'm glad it's here. i'll be back for more, for sure.

Still giving it four stars and I've eaten here four times since the first time I reviewed this places.  I really like everything I've had, but my favorite is one that my husband got the last time: sweet curry with nuts. He likes nuts, but whatever.  It sounds lame, but it's incredible. Spicy and sweet is such a great combo and I ate more of his, than my own spicy noodles. My dish was good, his was great.   It's cheap for dinner; around $20 for both dishes, and is plenty of food for a second meal, later.   La's: it's what's for dinner.

My mom offered to take me out so we could have our own Mother's Day dinner, just the two of us. I picked Cafe Monarch based on Yelp and we couldn't have asked for a better experience.  The place itself is so warm and inviting. The patio is seriously magical with all the candles and greenery.  The food was equally as great. We checked the menu online before we made reservations to see what was on tap and the menu for the evening sounded really interesting. And it was.  It was $55 a person for the four courses and it was worth every penny. Our service was excellent and since we went a little early, we had the place to ourselves for almost an entire hour.  I will definitely be back and bring the husband for a date night. So glad we found this place!

holy horchata.  i always say, there's no better way to try a beverage for the first time, than to drink an entire gallon of it. and trying the horchata at america's was no exception.   i had no idea what to expect, but immediately fell in love with it. all gallon of it. second best thing to drink, next to beer, with mexican food. so, so good.  the carne asada burrito was one of the best i've ever had. ever. the beef was just so good, tasty, tender, and loads of it. the tortillas were incredible; just right so they didn't take over the burrito, but added to the flavor.  the ceviche was awesome; chopped up like salsa...whatever they do to it works. big time. it's 10:17am and i'd eat a bowl of it now...for breakfast...with milk and a spoon.   i had two different types of salsa and i loved both equally. the only reason i'm giving it 4 starts is that the veggie quesadilla was pretty far below the rest of the food. basically, it was like they put quac, shredded lettuce, and a sliced up cucumber in a tortilla and threw it in the micro. you know how all of those vegetables are all kind of the same color; blah green? that's how i'd describe the taste: blah green.   but everything else was incredible. you can eat like a king for around $20 and by like a king i mean, two burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla, and a couple of horchatas.   next time i'm sitting on the front porch. so all of 7th can watch me feed my face, cookie monster style.

I just tried out this place for the first time and I had the best manicure and pedicure I've had in years. And I went on my due date for our first baby--not the most comfortable I've ever been in my life. The place is extremely clean and friendly. The girl that did my nails massaged my legs for about 10 minutes each- I could have taken a nap while she was working on me. She was also really friendly, but not overly talkative so, it was really a relaxing experience. Plus, I could understand everything she said, and there wasn't any annoying chatter among themselves, where you're wondering what they're saying about you. I will absolutely be going back there again. I made an appointment for the same day, but really, it wasn't necessary if you had 10 minutes to wait. Best $35 (for both, minus tip) I've spent in quite a while. This is my new go-to nail place- you can't go wrong here.

When we get the coveted and rare date night, we almost always try to hit up The Mission. That means we've been here four times since we became parents a year ago. First up, the guac is a must must must! It's some of the best guac I've ever had. Seriously, I have dreams about it. I could bath in it. And I may, if they ever let me.  Secondly, the drink menu changes fairly often and although a lot them are on the sweeter side (not my fav), they do have one that I've fallen in love with. Avocado margarita- they have a fancy name for it, but it's an avocado margarita. And it's one of the best drinks in town. It may sound weird, but I'm asking you to try it because if you have taste buds, you'll be happy you did. Third on the list is the pork belly dish. Just eat it. That is all. And lastly is the halibut. I've had this dish the last two times we've eaten here and I will have it again. The sauce they give you to pour over the dish...oh, the sauce. I would have poured it directly into my mouth if it wasn't frowned upon in Scottsdale. The killer food is a great compliment to the awesome ambiance (love the chandeliers!) and the people watching. Make a reservation- the secret's out!

Awesome. Duane is so friendly and explains everything he's going to do. There were no surprises and everything was done right. I had him completely remodel our master bath, the guest bath, and rip off the counter tops in the kitchen. He charged what he estimated it would cost, even though there were a couple of little extra things he ended up having to do. We're having him back to install our laminate flooring in a couple of weeks. I'll never need another handyman!

i was really hoping for a great, local neighborhood bar and instead i got 3 tiny shrimp bruschetta for $11.   what tater tots? there were no tater tots on the menu last night.   this is about the most overpriced place i've been in a while. it's way out of place in the 85257. i split the brushetta, had a dinner salad, and 2 beers and my total was $25. i went home and ate dinner, that's how little food $25 got me.   i went with a group of my neighbor girls and the best thing about it, is the fact that we could ride our bikes there.   we really just wanted to get some drinks and a few apps to share, but their apps are not share friendly. mostly dinner salads (for $9) and soups. (the entrees start around $20-$25 dollars).   for serving entrees that cost that much, the beer menu was pathetic. fat tire was the best they had, second best was blue moon, if that gives you any idea.   if you're looking for a typical scottsdale, overpriced, disappointing place to have dinner, you can add avalon to that long list.

Here's why I like this place: I like wine (aka Mommy Juice). And they have lots of it.  Let's face it: Postino started and leads the pack on wine bars and 5th and Wine seems to recognize that by serving some of their dishes. Which is fine with me because 5th and Wine is closer and easier to snag a table. Their homemade mozzarella is one of my favorite things. If they had a plate of just that, bread, and olive oil, i'd order it every time. The other items in the dish are just a bonus. The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is the fact that the last 3 times we've been there, our servers have not been super educated on the wines. We were totally spoiled the first time we hit this place: our server knew the wine list inside and out and recommended wines that we really liked and regularly look for, now. Since then, when we ask our servers what they recommend for different types of wine, they have had to ask the bartender and even then, the wines just haven't been on target. I get that it's a little bit hard to know every wine on a gigantic list and I have no problem with our servers asking the bartender for suggestions. But when you work at a place called 5th and Wine, you should be able to know the difference between a merlot and a zin...which one of our servers did not. I'm totally willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and continue going here- I mean, we keep trying different wines until we get one we love, so, it's a win-win.

I don't think you should ask your clients if they are getting an eyebrow wax, when they aren't getting one. Which is what happened to me. My girlfriend and I tried out Bronze Boutique strictly for the killer deal of a mani/pedi offered in the Republic. This place is a glorified tanning salon, and nothing more. The pedicure was mediocre and the person who gave it to me, asked me if I was also getting my brows waxed. To which I replied, "No. Are you saying I need to?"  My girlfriend was also lectured on how long it had been since she'd had her last pedicure (she lives in CO...it's not flip-flop weather there in January).  Also, I didn't think insults were included in the package, but I was wrong.  The treatments were supposed to be the "elite" versions, but if those were elite, I'd hate to see what their regular services entail. The service was pretty lame, and the results were equally as bad. There was no spa treatment about it; strictly business and we were in and out as fast as they could do it. The special was $35 for both services and my nails look like it. You get what you pay for, so spend the extra $20 and hit the salon in a strip mall near you.

Randomly finding a place has never ended up so great.   The owners are so friendly and warm, they greet you with big hello's when you walk in the door. Everything you see is made there, by them, each day. And it tastes like it.   The sandwich menu is huge and all sounded incredible; it was really had to choose. You can't go wrong with the lunch special of 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad...we were served WAY more than 1/2 of salad.   My sandwich (panini, really) was fantastic- ham and brie. Some of the sandwiches they can't split, but they ended up splitting the meatball anyway for my husband. He said he'd choose another, but they were so cool, they did it anyway.   They also gave us a free, fresh pastry, (all are made by the owner's wife) for the baby (I'm expecting at the end of June).   The people alone are worth it to stop by, and the food was so fresh and good, you're missing out if you don't give it  a try. They also do crepes and that's next on my list to get.

I had way high hopes for this place and honestly, the flavor I had was gross. No other way to describe it. And I'm not sure how, because it seems like it would be hard to make Kahlua gross. But it was.  The service wasn't super, either. It was 8:30 on a Saturday night and we were the only ones in there. And it was like she was on a mission to get us to pick a flavor and get out as quickly as possible.  I love booze and ice cream, but that's probably the last time I'll do them together. And that in itself is probably for the best.

Good, not great, not bad is the theme of this place.  It's good if you're looking for decent happy hour prices and food. Nothing outstanding, but nothing to really complain about.   Tons of TV's to watch whatever sports are on, although one time when we were there, the guide was stuck on one TV, and it was all of the pay-per-porn channels, which was hilarious.   Good happy hour prices and a good beer selection. The food has ranged from boring to pretty good. Nachos, totally lame- chips, tons of cheese, a few grilled onions, and about 4 hunks of chicken. However, the salads I've had were really good- lots of ingredients and flavor and good portions. And the sandwiches were great choices, too.   The atmosphere- great if you have kids, which is odd for a place with good happy hour deals and tons of TV's. We brought our babe and it was surprisingly appropriate because just about every table had kids. But if you're looking for a young, fun, happening happy hour spot, this isn't it. Unless throwing back some milk is your poison.

This place is odd and seems to be run kind of hap hazard. I've been here one and a half times: once for dinner, and once attempting lunch but we didn't stay. The dinner was pretty good. I had the steak salad and it was good, but over-priced for the amount of steak. Our server was actually the best part of it- she had good recommendations and we were trying to make a movie, so she had us in and out in time to make the previews. Other than the salad, we shared an app, but I can't remember what it was. Meaning it was probably average. My husband had the pork sandwich and said it was really good. All in all, decent food and good service. Ambiance gets a D- it's like eating in one gigantic, loud, dark room with no decor. I can't remember the decor or style in there either. The only way I can describe it is dark and dark.  The lunch we attempted was after we tried to hit True Food at 1p and there was still a 30 minute wait. My friend and I both have little ones and weren't interested in waiting in the 110 heat for lunch. We walked into an empty TK's and sat down...only to find out they were out of high chairs. Yes, it was empty, save the one woman with her one child and the three other high chairs she was saving for friends. Not only does the place apparently only have 3 high chairs, but there was zero attempt to accommodate us otherwise. No offer of boosters, no apology, no nothing. Just a shrug and a...and that was it. So, we left and probably won't be back. There are too many great places to eat at the Quarter to waste your time on this one.

Stopped here for some early dinner and a beer, after driving by. Really glad we did- our meal was incredible. It's not a big place, but it has a fun atmosphere, decent sized bar, and lots of patio seating, which is nice starting this time of year. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and received excellent service throughout the meal. Not a huge beer menu, but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices ($4/pint, $10/pitcher).   A smaller menu with excellent choices makes me happy and that's what they offer. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus- really glad we did that. Grilled just right and drizzled with a sauce that is slightly sweet made it even better.   I got the burger, my husband got the brisket sandwich and we traded halves. Both were very tasty. The actual burger itself was full flavor- my only suggestion was maybe a few less toppings. I like a burger topped with a few things, but this patty had so much flavor that I felt all the toppings almost took away from it.   The brisket sandwich was the big hit of the night. Great flavor in the meat, tender and juicy and enough slaw on top to give it a a nice tang and add texture. The buns on both sandwiches were excellent and high quality.   We had our little one with us and they have a pretty good kids menu, too. It's not listed on the actual menu- the server will rattle it off for you. Ours is a grilled cheese fiend and theirs was great- two kinds of cheese on 9 grain, served with grilled asparagus and fries. We actually asked them to substitute tomatoes for the fries, which they easily accommodated, and she plowed through the hole thing. Minus the asparagus- but that's on her, not Grassroots :)

Please don't order the panini- any of them. We met some friends for brunch this past Sunday and the three girls each got different paninis while the guys got omelets. I got the veggie which was supposed to have egg, spinach, onion, tomato, and a garlic aioli.  It did, but barely. When it arrived, I opened it up on my plate and everybody gasped- there was about a teaspoon sized dollop of egg, 3 spinach sprigs, a couple of pieces of diced tomato and onion. Zero garlic aioli. There was a little more egg on the other half, but the rest of the ingredients were the same level of barely there. I showed our server when he came back and he was mortified and brought me a huge plate of scrambled eggs to add to the sandwich. In the meantime, the other girls had realized the same thing was happening on their paninis so we ended up sharing the extra egg to try and build some kind of substance.  The boys said their omelets were decent, but nothing to rave about. Also, they charge $1.50 extra for a tiny bowl of fruit- seriously, about 3 grapes and a couple pieces of melon. The bill for my husband and I, including a bacon bloody mary and one of their Mules was $47.50...pretty ridiculous considering there couldn't have been more than $3 worth of ingredients on my sandwich.  In the restaurants defense, we saw dishes go past that looked really good. Maybe go for the waffles or another big breakfast dish because those all seemed legit. I don't know why they even have paninis on the menu since they clearly don't want to make any kind of effort with them.
