Rick and the guys and gals at Techniprint never fail to deliver amazing customer service and great printed pieces! My company has been working with them for several years and we can't help but continue to use them! Many times I have less than 24 hours to get our collateral printed, and every time they deliver! Can't thank you guys enough!

Not only is this place great for a quick and tasty Mexican dinner, but the employees here are FANTASTIC as well! My husband and I frequent J-Too a lot, I didn't realize how much until today. My husband was on his way home from work, and unfortunately was hit by a red light runner right in front of this restaurant. When I arrived to the scene, one of the employees came out and gave us some cold water bottles, and then said he remembers us from when we dine in, he said he was sorry to see the accident and hopes my husband recovers quickly, then he offered us a discount on dinner. His kindness was so appreciated during this stressful and scary time! Then, while we were eating our meal another customer's car battery died, and I think the manager offered to find jumper cables and help charge their battery. It was so cool to experience and see these guys go the extra step! We'll be back! Thanks again!!

All I can say is I am incredibly grateful for Dr Wright and his amazing staff! Just this week I had to take both of my small dogs in for urgent care! The staff was friendly and helpful! I took my Chihuahua Terrier in because he had been intensely coughing for several days. They were able to fit us in right away, and we're really great during the apt. That night my Pug started coughing so hard he starting throwing up. I called the next morning and they squeezed me in between Dr Wrights surgery appointments. The Dr didn't make me feel rushed or that I was inconveniencing him at all. He took such great care of my pups, offered several options for their care and let me choose what I could afford/thought was appropriate (didn't shame me for not choosing certain options) and they offered great payment plans. Thank you guys so much! So glad I drove past their office and that the reviews were actually as great as the experience! We will be customers for life!

Dr. Kessler and his staff were amazing! So friendly and very helpful. I really enjoyed my first visit here, and definitely plan to come back! I loved the fact that he really took the time to make sure all my questions were answered, and as an added bonus he provided some great information and shared a lot about his practice. It's neat to see that the history and longevity of this establishment has lasted through the years. According to Dr K, this building has been operating as a optometrist facility for over 40 years! I highly recommend this place, really grateful to have found them!

Sadly, I don't think time has ticked in the Gelato Spots favor. Back in 2005, the quality and atmosphere of GS was bursting with flavor and cheerful employees. The last three times I've been to various locations, the employees serve nothing but attitude and the quality of the gelato has suffered and in fact has greatly diminished. It's quite a shame be GS used to be my favorite dessert spot.

My only qualm with the place is that they only serve biscuits and gravy on Saturdays, and my husband works every Sat :( but other than that, this place is always hopping and always delicious!! Whenever I have friends visit from out of town I make sure to take them here! Everything is egg-cellent!! :D

I LOVE THIS OASIS! It is like a paradise in the desert! As a native to the valley, I've often heard of the Valley Ho, but never stayed there. I joined a modern architecture group that holds events here annually and decided to stay after this year's event.  The staff is amazing, kind and welcoming, but also very quiet! The valet service was so great and friendly.  And the hotel itself is worth just experiencing. The minute you drive under the signature neon sign you are greeted with a friendly wave by the valet and instantly transported to another world.  Once you walk into the lobby you can see the guests lounging and hanging out, it's never empty, but never overwhelming. You feel like you're going to run into a friend and have the time of your life. As you're guided to your room by the bell boy, he gives you a brief history of the hotel, explaining the modern architecture and the spirit of the Valley Ho.  This hotel honors an era long past and keeps that spirit alive and well.  We highly recommend this experience! And cannot wait until our next stay!

Probably one of the best Frys in the Valley, yes even better then the snooty North Scottsdale one up on Hayden and dare I say even better then the beloved Shea and Tatum store. Only every once and a while the produce section is a little understocked. But I guess that's because all of the patrons are buying their veggies, so I can't be mad. Everything else is generally great. Their lines are never too long. Their cashiers are friendly and not over bearing. Their self checkout is never really broken. And the have a great selection of natural/organic foods, which I love! They are my favorite store!  Oh yeah, they're open late and their floral section is usually really great!

Wow! I tried Pho for the very first time, and I am in food-heaven! It was so yummy and hit the spot of everything I was hungry for! And to top it off, the staff here are so, so nice! I called my order to go, and my husband went in to pick it up. Both on the phone and in person they really impressed us with their kindness, thoroughness, and friendliness. I can't wait to go in and enjoy the sit down area next time!

I'm giving them a four star review simply based on the amazing flight attendants that served the last four flights I had with them and for the honest brand image they portray: "cheap flights done right."  BE WARNED: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR!   Their aircraft is noticeably lower quality, but it's not so bad that you feel uncomfortable, their chairs, while incredibly thin and light weight, are surprisingly more comfortable to me than Southwest's, while the cheap fair literally is just for the plane ticket and any additional bags or even carry-on's all cost extra, it's still a steal when bags and flight cost less than the competitors.   To avoid the lines, MAKE SURE TO PAY FOR YOUR BAGS AND CARRY ON ITEMS IN ADVANCE ONLINE!!! I cannot stress this enough!!!!!! Luckily I did and was able to streamline the check-in process. But many others did not and had to pay the price for that by waiting in line before even getting through security. Luckily their service men and women are really trained for this type of people herding and make announcements through out the ordeal. They were saying not to worry, they move these lines quickly, but I could imagine how annoying and stressful it is to have to wait through the lines.   Overall it was a great experience because the flight attendants were great and some how the pilots sped through really fast, each fight came in at least 25 mins early! I loved that! They do offer a lot of in-flight drinks/snacks, but it costs a pretty penny. I do wish they had more flights available for the price! I'm a fan!  However, they did lose one star because there is absolutely no signage and if you arrive early or late they have absolutely no staff available to help you. Its like the staff shows up 5 mins before check-in times and leave immediately after. Everything seems to happen in a whirlwind, but I like the cheap flights, so I can't complain too much!

Fun sports bar! My husband and I stopped by with a groupon for the first time. The build-your-own-burger was great! A lot of options at a decent price.  The spinach-artichoke dip was DELISH! As well as the soft pretzel, seriously the best pretzel I've ever had!  We especially love that they are open late!  Also be prepared for limited parking/valet!  Drove past on a friday night and that place was alive! We weren't in the mood for loud DJ/group of people, but if we were, it would be a fun place to be!

I am a die-hard Barros fan! I grew up with this pizza and I just love everything here so much... Which is why it pains me to give this location only TWO stars.   I went here on a Tuesday night after work for a quick dinner with my husband. We got a medium BBQ chicken pizza, amazing! The gal taking our order was pleasant.   The two stars is given because of the poor state of the salad bar. I'm not sure if this place just doesn't get a rush hour (it was completely empty the entire time we were there). But the salad bar was so poorly stocked, quite disheveled, the ice berg lettuce looked three days old - was wilted and wasn't chopped to a reasonable size - more like pulled apart carelessly. The tomatoes were old and mushy, some starting to rot, several containers or condiments were basically empty.   I know this isn't a salad place, it's a pizza joint. But every other Barros I've been too has always taken care of their salad bars.   When this salad bar is right by the registers there really isn't an excuse to not tend to it or keep clean and stocked.   Since I am a huge fan, and I work in the area, I will try to come back during lunch to see if there are any improvements to the salad bar.

When it was delivered all of the toppings were tipped to the side as if someone dropped it or it was tilted. My office is less than 10 mins way from this location, my car was getting repaired so I didn't have a vehicle to grab lunch somewhere and this was pretty much the only place that delivers. Very disappointed.  I did call and ask for a refund. The manager, John, was very nice and refunded my order. Just bummed because this is my second not to great experience at just this location. And from the other reviews it seeks to be the only consistent thing at this location. So I probably won't be back.

Wow!! This is Old Town Scottsdale's best kept secret!!! My husband and I have driven past this little venue dozens of times and only by chance did we decided to stop on for a late breakfast, which they serve ALL day!! Upon entering you'll be greeted by friendly faces and an eccentric environment. The menu is simple and I'm sure the hosts will go into detail on all the different ingredients that they make and cook themselves. I got the Belgium waffle with hit fruit compote - so good! But be careful the compote was smoldering!! My husband got the pancakes with maple syrup, he loved it! The bacon was spot on, crunchy and delicious. And the eggs, while really over priced. But they were the best $4 eggs I've ever had!!! I highly recommend this place. It's pretty small though, so don't plan a big party!  I forgot up mention the chai tea! Get it!!! So yummy and milky!

Reverse happy hour is great!!! Great prices and delicious food!! We loved their teriyaki and sweet and sour chicken bowls. And the sashimi and rolls have been above par!! This is our new go-to sushi joint! And it's a half mile from home, so we're super stoked!! :)

This was place pretty tasty! My husband LOVED everything about it, the penne was a little to dry and undercooked for me, but I was able to add some extra sauce and it was really tasty! We also got the garlic bread, so yummy! And my husband had the mac n'cheese with pork. He's a picky eater, so seeing him enjoy it was really good!
