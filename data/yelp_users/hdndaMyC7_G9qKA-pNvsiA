This is my favorite deli in Phoenix. Two words: Vermont Treat. (Made with Maple Glazed Ham, Pinenuts, Spinach, Sliced Apples, Duck and Decanter's Famous Cheddar Cheese Spread on Multigrain.)  I like this place because I always know what I want (see above), and anyone I bring with me can always find something that fits their tastes, too. For the indecisive bunch, Duck & Decanter offers a list of signature sandwiches with the ingredients already listed. And for the pickier, er, more decided folks, D&D can make custom sandwiches, too -- you can choose your bread, meat, and toppings.  The ready-made pastas and other sides here are delicious, too, but I rarely get them, because their sandwiches are already so filling!  **Helpful Hint: You must, must, must either beat the lunch crowd or postpone your visit until after the lunch hour, otherwise you'll be at the end of a very long line.**

I'm a big fan of LUSH. I don't use their products regularly, but I like to pick up a few, or try what's new, whenever I want to spoil myself. I've use their soaps, bath bombs and melts, and lotions (get the charity pot!), and I think I prefer the soaps and lotions -- just as a matter of personal preference, since those tend to last longer than, say, the bombs.  But *shopping* at LUSH is a whole different matter for me. Every time I go in there, I feel bombarded by the salespeople! Browsing beauty products should be fun and relaxing ... I just want to explore and see what they've gotten in that's new, etc., but instead I have a girl popping up in front of me every five minutes shoving different products in my face or grabbing my hands to smear them on me. All right already! I will buy something! I promise! Just let me find it on my own!

To be clear, I LOVE Forever 21, but this store was out of control. When I visited a few weekends ago, there were racks out of place and blocking walkways, piles of clothes on the floor in some spots, and all but one of the dressing rooms was closed. I did find and purchase five or six items that day that I still love and will be keeping, and I'll still be a fan of F21, but I don't think I'll ever go back to this location if I can help it.

I would consider Sprinkles to be like the Starbucks of cupcakes, meaning there may be better cupcakes out there, but these people do a good job with delivering a product and an image that people like, myself included.  The cupcakes are good -- cute, even -- and presented well. The store itself is pretty adorable, too, as is the rest of the branding and packaging and such. They have a very good selection of flavors and icings, with more than a dozen to choose from on most days. However, the variety is somewhat ... "vanilla," as it seems to be standards-only -- chocolate/coconut, red velvet/vanilla, cinnamon sugar, strawberry, lemon, mocha, etc.  Sprinkles cupcakes cost a little more -- $3.25/each -- than maybe most people are used to paying, but that's because patrons are paying for the brand/name/image and the assurance that they'll get a well-made cupcake with every order. Think of the $3.25 as insurance.

I've been to Stax several times in the past few months, and every time I've been incredibly pleased with my experience -- the food has been excellent, the service has been great, and the bill has come out to be very reasonable considering everything.  It makes sense then that I chose to go here last Thursday with my sister and coworkers for my birthday lunch. I had been looking forward to treating myself to one of their delish Veggie burgers all week!  I was a teensy bit disappointed by two things that day, however. 1. The music in the place was up SO LOUD that I could barely hear anyone at the table, and even though we asked our waitress to turn down the volume, I think she barely touched the dial, because I didn't notice any improvement whatsoever. And 2. Our service that day was not anywhere near what it had been on my previous visits. Our server simply disappeared once we were seated, so we didn't get to order for a looooong time, and I don't think she ever checked on us mid-meal.  Still, despite my last experience there, Stax still remains a favorite, and I'll be a frequenter as long as the service goes back to the way it was before. I'm keeping them at five stars for now, but rest assured, I won't be afraid to bump them down if my next visit isn't better! Are you listening, Stax??

I've been to Petite Maison four or five times now for lunch, and so far each time the food has been excellent -- EXCELLENT. My only complaint is that I wish there were more of it! No, not the portions -- I mean, I wish their lunch menu could be expanded by just two or three main entrees, so I could have more than just six options to choose from. (Two or three of which are usually salads, and the others are usually sandwiches).  Out of everything I've tried, the Pain Poulet is my favorite (a gourmet chicken salad sandwich). There are so many flavors in it, and the sliced almonds and grapes in the mix provide a satisfying crunch and texture. The Burger Maison is a close second. I don't know _what_ kind of sauce they put on it, but it's heaven.  Ask for a French soda while you're there! They come in fun flavors -- Mandarin Orange, Meyer Lemon, Peppermint, Passion Fruit, Pomegranate -- and are deliciously different from the norm.

I have been going to Ohana for about a year, but Mari has been cutting my hair ever since I moved to Arizona, which was in 2006.  At Ohana, I've had my hair cut and styled (always by Mari!), as well as enjoyed their massage and waxing services, and I have to say, they've never done anything but a fabulous job for me. It's true that there are less expensive places you could go in Scottsdale for the same services, but it's also true that you get what you pay for, and I say Ohana is worth every penny. The place is clean, the atmosphere is fun and chic, and the service is attentive and consistent.  The number one thing I appreciate about the staff at Ohana is that they listen to me. When I describe what I want and don't want, they take it into consideration, 100 percent. I'd recommend this salon to anyone -- and I have!

My boyfriend and I go to the location on Hayden frequently, and this has become one of our favorite pizza places around town. The place is always very clean, the staff is super friendly, and the service is relatively quick. If you like traditional pizzas, they have the regulars -- cheese, pepperoni, etc. -- but they also have some really creative ones, such as the Mexican (includes avocados and even sour cream), the Thai (lightly drizzled with peanut sauce), and the Berkeley Vegan.  I can only vouch for their pizzas, because that's all we've had so far, but their rusticas and calzones look amazing, and I plan on trying something different each time we visit. Also, I love that the Hayden location offers free delivery and 10 percent off all orders submitted online. I can easily put in an order and pick it up on my way home from work! Voila, dinner!
