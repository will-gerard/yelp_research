If there was an option for less then one star that's what this terrible excuse of a company is, no bill sent water was shut off paid the bill plus $50 reconnect fee, yes it costs them $50 in fuel to drive 4.3 miles to my house, have been without water for 3 days now. The bill was paid three days ago and cleared and still no water,  they promise us they would be out in an hour after the bill was paid. Yeah that was three days ago.. Hate hate hate Johnson Utilities if the people there hate their jobs then they need to find new ones.

It's been paid since Wednesday here it is almost a week later I still have no water!! They keep applying my payments to an incorrect account. They aren't even looking at my account number! What's the point of having an account number if they're aren't going to look at it? Now I'm being told that if anything happens to the walk that's on my meet her, that they're going to call the police and remove my meter even with a paid bill I still don't have water! Then being pretty much strong-armed by somebody by the name of Stephanie at their office I don't even dare to go in there anymore she is  6 feet tall and a big girl. Is this even legal? Since when did utility companies get to decide who they get to supply too even if the bill is paid? And then tell me that they're going to remove my meter and I will never have water in my house are you crazy? Stephanie needs to be fired from her job as she has no people skills and also wants to do is literally throw her weight around. Johnson utilities is a joke of a company and the joke of the business. I can't wait for them to go down.
