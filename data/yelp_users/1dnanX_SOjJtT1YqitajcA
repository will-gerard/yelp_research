I really dig This place :))) I come in - sit @the bar and am so comfy and know things are about to be so good. This is one of my go to places when i need to forget my day and just relax. The food is yummy and there is no place like it i have found in the Valley. Is it traditional - No. Is it tasty and awesome YES.   I got introduced to spinato"s through my bestie and have never turned back :) now first do not miss the cheesy garlic bread - usually cheesy bread is a filler - here with a trio of Meatballs in the Awesome Vodka Sauce it is a Meal! (both on the Happy Hr menu) it is THE BEST CHEESY BREAD IN TOWN!  With that said...  The Pizza is Great! I love the Traditional veggie or Nicole's special - BUT KNOW ALLLLL THE PIZZA IS AMAZING! now if your not a Thin Crust person - you just let them know and they can do your pizza Deep Dish Chicago Style - also AMAZING. I prefer the Vodka Sauce always FYI :)))  The Entire Menu is fun and tasty - so many not miss"s  like the spaghetti calzone and the meatball sub - or the crazy fun salads and yummy cannoli"s  - and do not miss WINE WEDNESDAY! So Yeah i really like this place :) so will you!  Why 4 stars not 5 - nothing to do with the food - i do wish they would deliver to my house :/ they will deliver to business by me but not my house. Second- they took away Diet Dr.pepper - not cool. WE ALL WANT IT BACK. :)

First this is classic american Chinese cuisine - not classic Chinese or modern fusion. Now with that said Kwan and wok is pure classic Chinese comfort food!!! I have been eating here since i was 15 and it never ever lets me down. Bright red sweet and sour pork and tasty old school fried rice.   You would miss the location if you were not looking for it - its in a classic basic strip mall but what is inside is worth going out of your way for :) it has all the classic fried yumminess us city kids grew up On:))) all classics are awesome and portions are large so it goes beyond 2 servings :)   The oil is fresh and clean which is huge in quality fried food - im a huge believer that if we are eating fried - may it be worth it :))) this is worth a stop :))) i really love the chow mane and fried rice- all of the diff fried rice! The soup is greAt and even the egg rolls are awesome- they do have pork in them - heads up For my veggies in the house :)))  Its a takeout spot but if you do eat in- bathroom is clean and its by the light-rail. Why not 5 stars ? The crab puff use to be amazing and now it is more like a won ton :/ everything else is still amazing :) enjoy!

Our Neighborhood use to have the best Mexican food spots - use to being the key words here. This lack of excellence is what lead us to Manuel's on bell. Unfortunately this is not a Glory Story for the Masses looking for Excellence as well in the Neighborhood- this is a tale of mediocre over salted food with a cast of Bartenders and servers who should be Replaced.   First we are bar sitters :) we like to sit @the bar close to the beer!  I find that service is also faster @the bar in most places. Not that we are in a hurry - we love long fun dinners! We also love fun nice bartenders- that does not exist here. I have never been around such stiff rude bartenders in my life! Asking them to get you another drink even when the place is empty seems like a chore to them. When they are not staring daggers at the patrons they are standing in the back left corner of the bar restaurant area talking to servers and anyone but the customers.  Now the food is hit and miss. Somethings are great like the cheese crisp with green chilies or the happy hr rolled tacos- for the most part the rest of the menu is over-salted and lacks a fresh taste. This alone is disappointing due to that we are located in the heart of Mexican culture and food being in AZ so the food should reflect that- it shouldn't taste like a Mexican food restaurant in Idaho. Dumping tons of salt on food does not count as "great flavor" btw.  To be honest we went over what was worse the service or the food - we decided the service. The bartenders are just so rude. It is like they have been there so long that they just hate everything to do with the place yet stay! The older lady could possibly been the worst. She just came across angry. She also charged us for salsa after we bought chips to go - they usually come with salsa. That was a first. We tried this place numerous times hoping we just caught the bartenders on an off day - everyday there apparently is an off day.   Overall don't go. There are so many other undiscovered gems out there - where they love there job and are happy to talk to patrons- grab em a drink - and take your money with a smile :) cheers!

I am a pizza lover - nothing like dough and cheese with great sauce! I like alllll kinds of pizza except this pizza. I not only hated this pizza I rendered it inedible! The sauce was gross tasted like salsa without the heat. The cheese was rubbery and not tasty @all.   We also got a calzone that was disgusting- filled with ricotta cheese that made it soggy - no mozzarella inside just ricotta cheese and more of the gross sauce :/ the veggies were not great either.   We also got garlic knots and wings - I did enjoy them but I'm not sure that I liked them because they were good or everything else was so bad that it made those 2 items taste ok? Seriously.   In all this was a real bummer of a food experience. I was hoping to find a neighborhood gem but just found a neighborhood bust. Not to mention how expensive the bad food was - I will not be a future customer and I highly recommend trying any other pizza place.

Ok West World get your parking game together! We went to west world for the great american nightmare haunted house and Rob Zombie concert - this place is not equipped to handle large concert traffic!  I am familiar with this venue because when i was younger i use to direct parking there myself! Back then they did not close off the streets to direct you to one single line that goes around in an unnecessary circle!?!   We missed half the concert because of this parking nightmare!!! No we were not late we got into this parking line @715 doors were @7 and concert started @8 pm!!! More than enough time for any other concert venue.   No one should wait to park for an event for over an hr - thats sick and wrong!!!!   West world is not an appropriate concert venue - it is not equipped to handle the influx of people.   I feel sorry for the people that missed the concert because of this- im pissed we missed half - cant imagine missing it all.   This should have been called - The Great American parking Nightmare!!!!  West world should stick to car and horse shows. EPIC FAIL.

Ok i have been holding off on reviewing Takamatsu because how do you really write up your favorite restaurant? Obviously i love the place! The food is out of this world and my sushi chef is like extended family. My favorite food is sushi. I love to try new and fun places but it all always comes back to Takamatsu.   Ok so first : they have everything from sushi to Korean BBQ- to noodle bowls. If you love sushi and Korean - and a great noodle bowl - this is the golden goose of spots to eat. Yes they have cooking @the table or you can order it to taste. Yes they have ALL traditional Korean plates and yummy sides. I suggest the pork belly!   Second: i go there to eat SUSHI - this is my sushi spot. My safe place with amazing food. Its a perfect date spot! I sit @the sushi bar with Jon and i know im about to love everything that touches my lips. This is my happy place.   First fav: Tuna mango Nigiri and Spicy Tuna Mango Nigiri - this was created by head sushi chef Jon :) it is an amazing pairing of flavor and a not miss!!!!  Second fav: Sashimi Salad - this is a mix of tunas,salmon and smelt! With a spicy twist! The thought makes me salivate!   Third fav: Screaming Orgasm - a take on tuna tataki that is mouth watering and makes me literally moan how good it is. Its amazing!   And the last thing i love about takamatsu is that Jon shops for his Customers. He cares about quality in the fish and veggies and is always keeping the menu fresh. Now reading the yelp reviews i see the number 1 complaint is service time  - no Takamatsu is not a Fast Food Spot- the food here is made fresh and with love and that takes time- this is a Meal place - you come and have a Food Experience. If you are looking for a quick meal - i suggest you slow down and start appreciating what you let touch your lips.

This is my go to spot for quick excellent mediterranean food - its not a fancy place - this is a really great neighborhood place - clean with an A rating and simple.   The food is tasty and fresh - and the portions are large - i get the 10 house special which is white meat chopped chicken grilled with fresh onion and bell pepper - its laid over this amazing rice that just is so on point. Comes with salad bread and soup! They also have the best babbaganush in  town!!!   Oh yeah they have gyros ;) but with plates as good as theres thats just a bonus.

If u like real sushi - fresh sashimi-  than this place is not for you. My nigiri and sashimi were not fresh and extremely questionable  quite frankly scary. They could not get my order correct either. I wouldnt feed what they served me to my dog. Serious fail.

First i want to disclose that i volunteered here last year and i thought that was amazing! This year i was  a customer and i got Blown Away With Fear!    Ok so we got there @715 on a tuesday and it was easy to park - fast to get in - and gave us all night for all 5 Haunted Houses plus it was not busy which makes it scarier and more intimate :))) felt like everyone there was just to scare us!   The Haunted Houses and Corn mazes are so detailed and scary - the actors stay in character and really work to scare and you feel like this is a full on scare experience! The roaming actors are insane scary and ready to chase you with a chainsaw!! Love it!  We spent 2 hrs just screaming and laughing and blowing off steam from the mundane work grind- thank you fear farm - thank you so much!!!! Cant wait until next yr!!!!

I Grew up in Miami Florida Eating Cuban Food and this Establishment is a BLESSING for us South Florida / East Coast AZ Residents. I thank the food Gods for this place!   There is no bad food here but if your going for a first time i have some great suggestions- load up on the pastries! They are to die for and worth fattening up over - my fav is the Guava and Cream cheese yum.    If your going for lunch /dinner do not miss the classic cubano sandwich  - holy yummy! The pork is just like Miami pork and the pressed bread is amaze-balls! Also the meat pies are a NOT MISS!   They also serve classic cuban Breakfast and cafe con leche (cuban coffee and milk) the eggs are the best in town! And the classic coffee and milk is just a blast from the past from my Miami days!   In All obviously its a must try -  support this small business get out of your normal food box and discover your next Addiction

Win Co is employee owned and operated! Thats big points with me- that and the ridiculous awesome low prices! The prices remind you of when name brand stuff was affordable... Like CEREAL :))) you dont need a big brother tracking card to get your savings- you just save. No smoke and mirror shopping here- straight up savings. Not to mention how clean and bright it is. This is where i grocery shop now :))) 4stars cause the place is HUGE- and i dig a smaller shopping center- other than that - im happy:)))

My friends birthday party is why i ventured out to the yard. From the time i drove up i was not impressed. They have free Valet but it was filled up and so were all the places they told me to park. Not to mention all the police who were parked around this place waiting to give you a $70 parking ticket for parking on the street! I ended up parking across the street in a closed dark auto parts place. Then having to cross 7th st in what i called a suicide race to the other side- not great.        Once we got across the street we had to figure out where to enter - entrance is in the back - by valet. We went straight to the bar to meet my friends. It was very packed and i did get service rather quickly - i got the pinot Grigio on tap which i thought was very cool - but my glass had lipstick all over the top - when i pointed this out she poured it out and gave me another glass which had less wine in it. I felt like she was punishing me for there mistake.   We proceeded to order food - we started with the pretzel fondu appetizer this was mediocre @best - i think they microwave the pretzels! And the fondu was beyond salty - know i was looking forward to having dinner here - that excitement ended with the appetizer. We had to order everything @the bar then take it to the area where my friends were because there are no servers for the back.   Know your standing @this place because there is not enough seating. When i went to the restroom it was confusing because its unisex - i have no prob with this when done right. The bathroom was filthy and there was a broken bottle in my stall - so gross.   Overall i did not like the yard - it was overpriced and customer service is non existent. Why 2 stars not 1 ? They did have a sam adams promotion and we got free T- shirts which was cool and i did like the pinot on tap- just not enough to ever get me back in that place.

This place feels special - all tucked away in a beautiful old school downtown phoenix neighborhood. Walking up it feels upscale but not stuffy - very comfy and the outside layout is super chill and nice. There happy hr is awesome and very affordable - i had the pinot Grigio and  the hummus offered for happy hr - it was 4 bucks and huge! Mom had the fish tacos and thought they were very nice - perfect way to kick off first fridays before the walk:))) our server Brooks was knowledgable and super friendly! They offer complimentary valet which is sooooo convenient. I will deff be back @the vig - its a downtown must do spot :)))

Finding Italian worth eating in north west phoenix is not exactly easy - there are very few spots that offer good quality Italian food - i will say This place is one of them!   I found this place through a best friend of mine and now frequent the establishment often. I love love love there pasta! Its cooked to perfection and there sauces are spot on! Pasta Giovanni is a fave but i also love the Alfredo and there pesto Alfredo - all of there sauces are on point!   There is also Pizza and all the classic favs like lasagna and eggplant parm! They have great appetizers like Italian fried cheese and Calamari - believe it or not there fries are amazing!!!! Ever try fries with red sauce or pesto aoli ?  You should :))) they have killer huge salads as well - i love the tuna salad :)   The service is awesome! Im a bar girl so i never sit in the dining room but the bar service is on point! Especially when Suzy is on Shift - she is friendly and funny and always glad you came :) not to mention how she cares about the little things like Halloween Napkins - that made my day brighter!   Oh yeah! If your into clam chowder they serve it Fridays made from scratch and it is the BEST in the Valley!   Why 4 stars and not 5... Well i don't like there bread. The bread tastes cheap and preservative like - its just not good. I would love if they stepped there game up and tried a better Italian or french bread - i would eat sandwiches then - which they offer quite a few of but the bread is so bad i will not do it as of now.   Overall its awesome - and i love it here!!! :)))
