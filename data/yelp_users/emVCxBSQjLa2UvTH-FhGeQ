I would give this place ZERO stars if I could. I drove all the way from the west side of town (45 min drive) to rent a costume for my daughters birthday from them for the next day. I was told on the phone it was $50 and they needed to keep credit card #. When I get there I was told that to be able to take it home I needed a major credit card and not a  VISA debit. My husband and I own a reputable business in the area and had a Visa Debit card with my name and the business name. One worker said they just needed approval from the manager but it should be OK, they do it all the time. So they called her and she said "NO" but would come down and speak to me. The employee warned me that she was "VERY MEAN" and to get ready and she was sorry in advance. As the manager approached me she had her arms out as if ready for a fight. She was rude, saying that she wouldn't take anything else. So I offered to call my husband with his major credit card information or if we could fill something out online or if I could have her take $300 from my visa debit to hold until we returned it. She said she needed to see my husband in person to take his card. I said she could call our business.( as he was at work and was an hour away)Then I said I would give her $500 deposit because I really needed this costume and I would pay them $100 to rent it (double than they asked) This costume was not worth more than $40 BTW.  She kept laughing in my face and saying NO NO NO NO NO. Then she grabs the costume off the counter and say's "I"ll keep this back by me", as if I was going to steel it or something. Anytime I questioned what she was saying she would say "just get out, just get out now, you can't have this costume". Then there was this tall big guy that sat down behind me like a "bouncer" and they kept smirking at each other. She said she was going to call the owner. The owner came down and the first thing she said was "IM VERY BUSY, I'm rerouting a router and this is taking up my time coming to talk to you" then she looks behind me (not letting me say a word) and the manager (short blonde haired girl) must have said something to her and the owner says "she wants to rent THAT costume, NO, leave" and turns around and walks away. I said I have purchased from her before and she would be losing a customer and she said (while waving behind her head, walking away) "I DON'T CARE!!!! BYE, LEAVE MY STORE NOW" As I walked out, they said "and NEVER come back" while laughing to each other. The short blonde haired girl and the guy. Totally unprofessional , rude, unaccommodating, and aggressive. Don't give those people your money, they have ZERO respect for you as their customer.

I've been using them for over a year because they are close to my home. We drop off many clothes as my husband wears suits. Numerous times they have not given me all my clothes back. I've had to go back and pick them up. This last time they lost a blouse but then found it with other items of mine. They acted like it wasn't their fault and I must not have given them my claim ticket. They are poorly organized and you never know if you're going to all the clothes back that you dropped off. I'm going elsewhere.
