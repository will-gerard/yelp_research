Revolver Records is hands down the best used vinyl record shop in Phoenix. Tracks N Wax is still good, but Revolver has them beat with the huge amounts of vinyl as well as their prices. They also have large amounts of new records as well. The staff is relatively well informed and their gradings for vinyl records are extremely fair.   Revolver also host concerts, film viewings and more.   Check Revolver out when in downtown Phoenix and especially on First Fridays!

Their name isn't a lie. I leaked radiator fluid and started to overheat when I brought my truck in and thought the worst (new radiator etc...). Honest 1 said they'd take a look at it and get back to me the following day.  They said it was a water pump that busted and that was going to be around $300. I thought it was going to be much worse. They also fixed my battery too. I had my truck back in a day and it's been running fine ever since. Highly recommended!

Our group ate here during the day on a Sunday and expected to get reasonable service, reasonable food in reasonable amount of time. What we received was horrible service, nasty food and a hellish wait for it. Yes I know McFadden's primary service is that of a sports bar, but I can name 20 sports bars around the valley providing much better service and food. People are still paying for service and food and should be treated as such.   The Sunday we went we had went around 1pm. We were waiting to be seated by the hostess who had her purse slung around her shoulder as she was ready to leave. She said "Well, I guess I can seat you". Sorry, all we wanted to do was pay for lunch and drinks. Sorry for the inconvenience. We were sat in a section with about 2 other tables (the bar and restaurant was 'dead') and thought to ourselves, this should be quick. WRONG.   We ordered drinks and it took about 15 minutes to receive them. Then we put our order in. We had ordered items off of the happy hour (chicken strips and soup) and a sandwich. It took 45 MINUTES to receive these items. The Irish Potato Soup was separating and it looked like it had been maturing under a heat lamp for about 30 minutes. The French Dip sandwich was dry as a bone. Despite complaining about both of these items they were not taken off of our bill.   As we walked out I warned a couple going in to make sure they have hours of time to waste if they want food. The guy asked if I was serious due to the small amount of people inside. I reaffirmed him and he and his girl were on their way elsewhere. The least I could do was prevent someone else from experiencing McFadden's service and food. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other restaurants in Westgate City Center, McFadden's doesn't deserve your patronage.

I had the Classic Burger with a few modifications. The burger looked pretty good but it tasted quite salty (maybe due to the amount of grease?). The sweet potato fries were ok, but weren't as crispy as others I've had before.   Overall the place is clean and the food is served rather quickly.  I might give them another try to see if the salty burger was a fluke.
