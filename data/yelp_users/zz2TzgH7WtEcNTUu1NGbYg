Waitress super rude    All my friend did was ask to change her order (from a $16 app to the au poir) When we asked for the manager he was completely ignorant.   We Have been there Several times prior.  It was like they Were Trying to be rude for no reason.  II cannot believe all the good reviews here because I've heard many stories about how terrible they can be.

One of the worst experiences I've ever had in Scottsdale.  These folks need to head back to NYC and take their terrible food, service and bad attitude with them.     I cannot believe all the good reviews here.     There were eight of us so they automatically add the tip and boy did we pay for it.   The terrible waiter who admitted he was from buffalo complained about us right to our face and the odd thing is we didn't do anything at all.  Owner came over at the end of he night and told me that you don't have to like everybody as he doesn't like his ex wives (?) and they didn't need our business as they're always packed. He also suggested I write a terrible review so I thought I should.    Food is expensive and below average.   Definitely not worth it.

If I could give zero stars I absolutely would.  First, we walked into a huge SMOKING patio trying to figure our where the non-smoking area was. It was horrifically smokey and there were no non-smoking patio. Then, we cannot figure out where the hostess is only to figure it out after asking the bartender who advised this unusually dressed guy who was sitting up against the wall drinking a pop.  He seats us.  The actual hostess walks up to us to tell us that she wasn't ready for us to sit as she wasn't done preparing the table. We advised her that the hostess seated us and she argued that she was the hostess.  Moving forward we get out waiter who ultimately took our order.  My boyfriend orders a chowder and we both get one. I tell the waiter I did not order a chowder. He argued that he was 'positive' that I did.  I don't eat chowder so I assured him I didn't.  Btw, chowder, according to my boyfriend was terrible.   I order oysters that were literally warm and had unusual black things in them and we thought they were bad so didn't finish.  I order the steak with brandy sauce. Sauce was literally cold and although the steak was good, it was barely warm.  Also, I didn't get butter for my potato and didn't see the waiter for at least ten minutes so I was done.  I asked them to remove the steak as I was done. My boyfriend got the oyster shooter and saiid it was literally the worst thing he had ever eaten in his life. We got the bill and it was an old freakin' fashion tab that you couldn't tell what you were paying for and what you were not paying for.  We paid and left.  Probably one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.

One star is waaay too much for this place and it wasn't the place that was the problem, it was the service and the owner/management.      The company I work for had a Christmas party.  It was raining that day so we had to use the only elevator to go back and forth (we had it on the patio) from the patio to the bar.  We hadn't even started drinking alcohol yet.   Long story short, Denny, the desk boy was extremely rude.  He required us to allow the guests to get on the elevator first (weren't we guests?) only to have to get off the elevator to allow their 'guests' to get off on their floor.   That was fine, I dealt with his ignorant, controlling, little man syndrome.  The elevator was full of the people in my office and I made a comment after those particular guests got off the elevator and the door closed (I was trying to be funny) and Denny started yelling at me telling me they were guests.  He proceeded to tell me that we were also guests while he continues to yell at me.  Basically, we get into it because he wouldn't shut his mouth.   Later on, I went down stairs to complain about his bad behavior after I had lengthy discussions with the other folks that had been on the elevator.  He was behind the desk and after I asked for the management (which, of course, wasn't there) and he proceeded to tell me to get out.  He tried to kick me out of my own Christmas party.   Remember, I didn't do anything at all.  I was shocked.    I didn't leave and I went back upstairs.  Then, when it was time to leave, we started walking out the door and Denny points out the owner to me who was standing right there.  Obvioulsy, after my experience, I am done and we go out to get a taxi.  Then, the owner comes walking out and says he is calling the police on me.  Now I have my whole office waiting outside and the guy is calling the police on me!!  This was witnessed by multiple people including the fact that I did NOTHING at all.  Then, the other desk boy, Jesus, starts yelling at me.  I was absolutely baffled.  I had Canadian clients with me trying to understand what he was calling the police for.  Mind you, the owner never even spoke to me about what had occurred early and clearly didn't care.  The mother of the owner (I guess she also owns it) came out and started asking what occurred and she actually listened to me, but it didn't do any good.   Then, the guy who was calling the police says he is going to tell the police I was going to drive...?  What a horrible, horrible guy/company.    This place is a dump.   Management is as bad as their service.  Trust me when I say, they are TERRIBLE.   I will let everybody I know and will make complaints everywhere I can to alert to the terrible behavior.

I use to go to Yardhouse all the time and I would eat the Ahi tuna.  This time, I walked in and ate it and immediately got sick.  We notified the manager and then went to, literally, throw up.  I threw up the ahi and went back to the table and felt completely fine.  The manager told me that it takes six to eight hours to get symtoms, but it clearly was the tuna.

I have four words for this place: Yum, yum, yum and yummy!  I have lived around that restaurant for years and years and finally decided to try it.  The food was to DIE for!  I had the Scotch beef which was amazing.  So tender, juicy, just yummy!  Mashed potatoes were delish and so were the brussel sprouts.  The service was excellent.  Wednesday was our server and she rocked it.  I will be taking my clients/friends there a soon as possible.    P.S.  Did I say that the food was yummy?   That is an understatement!

I tried them again.  Hash towns were better but I specifically asked for fresh.  Unfortunately there was a long hair that came out of my mouth after the second bite.  Just prior yo that my links were cold.  I'm done.

OMG!  I have been here a few times now.  Usually, I just go and have the pork belly tacos which  are only $5 during happy hour.  Amazing.  However, I went there for lunch and they didn't have those tacos so I opted for the brisket and could not believe it.  It was probably the most flavorful piece of meat I have ever eaten in my life and that is huge as I love meat.  It also comes with HOMEMADE flour tortillas.  I'm such a tortilla girl, but I barely ate them as the brisket was soooo amazingly good.   It was so good, I ate two orders!!!!    It's not cheap, but it is well worth it.  Can't wait to go back.      BTW, they also sell moonshine!!!!  Too cool!
