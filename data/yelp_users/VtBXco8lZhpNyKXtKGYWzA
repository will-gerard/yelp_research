My fiancee and I were on a date and trying to decide where to eat. Neither one of us have ever been to McFaddens so we decided to try it. Worst decision we made. There was no one in the restaurant which now after leaving makes sense. We sat down and had to wait 10 minutes before having our drink orders taken. The place is infested with mosquitos. We were sitting there talking and just kept getting bit. When we finally got our drinks, they were in small plastic cups and my fiancees root beer tasted like seltzer water. We decided to just cancel our food and leave. We told the hostess we wanted to pay for the soda and leave. She said she told our server but our server avoided us at all cost. We finally got sick of waiting and went to the bar to pay but the manager took care of it. I made she contact with our server before we left and she just walked away without saying a word to us. If I could this review no stars, I would. This was the worst service we have ever received and will not be going back to this place.

They take such good care of their customers. Very friendly. Won't go anywhere else. Very highly recommended. If you pay with cash,  you get 10% off also.

My fiancee and I were trying to find a good place to eat after seeing a movie and we decided on Mama Ginas. It was the best decision we could have made. Our server, Stephanie, was amazing. She sat us to our table and not 5 minutes later, she was taking our drink orders. She Was very polite and nice. Our food came out very fast and was delicious. All 3 of the staff members were amazing and polite and made sure our food tasted good and if our service was good. We will most definitely be going there again. I highly recommend trying this place.

I was there this Saturday and like most girls who go out to Mill Ave wear sandals, well if you cherish you sandals and your life, don't go to this "country" bar. They let you have your drinks on the dance floor which causes spills and what not and you are slipping all over the place while trying to dance, also if you step on just the right mess, you will get a layer of god knows what on the bottom of your shoe that you have to scrub off when you get home. It's sticky and disgusting. You can't swing dance there because there are way too many people dancing. If the owners make it a rule and enforce that people can't take their drinks on to the dance floor, I would most likely be more into going back. Also, the type of crowd that goes are very out of place. When you wear Young and Reckless, SRH and all those brands that belong in more hip hop oriented clubs they will fit in, in a country bar, they look ridiculous and crowd the place for the people who are there to experience a country bar. They need a dress code or something.
