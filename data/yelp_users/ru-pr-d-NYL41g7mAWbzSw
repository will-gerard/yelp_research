This place has the best brisket of all time! The moist is so juicy and delicious! I just throw some on fresh white bread with some pickles and sauce and I'm good to go. They also have delicious creamed corn and their pulled pork is delicious too! This is the one place that my husband and I can always agree on. You will never go wrong at Texas BBQ House -- just make sure you get there in time (especially on Fridays) cuz their BBQ goes fast!

I stopped into Maggie's a few months ago on a whim. They had so much stuff in that small house - games, clothes, furniture, kitchen stuff, decor... I loved it! I found some great fabric for $.50 to $2.00 for a lot of yardage. There were tons of clothes and even some vintage favorites too for really cheap! I got this great peacock feather maxi shirt for $4 and they had a dollar rack on their patio where I found a few things too! I also found some cute tops, my now favorite pajama pants, and some craft supplies. Definitely stopping in there again soon!
