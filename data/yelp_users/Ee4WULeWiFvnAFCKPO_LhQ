Owner is the biggest Jerk I have ever seen. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!! He yelled at his employees and when I say yelled I really meant snarlled and spit. The employees weren't even doing anything wrong. The thing that got me is that I saw him putleft overs from an already eaten dish from a customer into what looked like the soup. Very Gross!!! This place has been open for 40 years With the same owner, WTF!

Went to this place again and loved it again!!! Brandon is an amazing bartender! He made my wife a Fabulous Chocolate Thunder Martini and an Electric pink Cosmo. The thunder was so good we ended up having 2 each. His Margarita is the best I have had in Arizona. We had the Ribeye Delmonico that was delicious and the Chicken Alfredo that was very good as well.
