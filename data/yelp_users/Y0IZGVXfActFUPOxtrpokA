Not exactly what I expected. All the ranting and raving I hear about this place, well it's on the lower end of places where I would eat steak. Asked for Medium steak and received closer to medium well. Don't think I'll be visiting any time soon. Creme brulee dessert was not better than the Keg.

I enjoy going to this HD. Recently bought a home and have so many questions. Everyone in this HD is very easy going and down to Earth. Some people might find their attitude toward each other rude but I find it humorous. It makes a work day go by faster and I don't take offense to it.  So far every employee I've encountered has been helpful and if not knowledgable about a certain product will find someone who is. I would like to say Ron in mill works is very knowledgable when helping me choose the right window. And Kevin a supervisor has continued to provide excellent service. I will continue my journey of house renovation with the help of this HD.

Rude staff. Upon arrival I noticed three employees with unhappy looks on their faces and immediately thought to myself this is not going to be a pleasant experience. To my surprise I was greeted by one of the staff while the others ignored me. You have to imagine this is a small store and everyone is with in talking distance to each other. I told the staff that greeted me that I was here for my 6months checkup of the two purchases I made within the year. I was then asked if I had brought my paperwork with me. I replied that I did not bring any paperwork with me and asked if my information could be found with a name search. The staff member seemed irritated and said she could run a search but data isn't always found. She continues to ask me when I made the purchase I replied within the past 6months. Then a 2nd employee interrupts and pretty much scolded me and said "you should always bring paperwork with you." I replied that I was told paperwork wasn't necessary when I first made the purchase. Then the 3rd employee says in a snarky tone, "I believe it says in the paperwork to bring the paperwork. I reply again that I was told paperwork wasn't necessary upon purchase.  Overall I felt like I was being attacked by the employees of Kay jewelers. As most people would say if you are unhappy with your job then find another one. Those employees give Kay jewelers a bad rep and I would think twice about returning for future purchases.

Staff was slow. The guy at the counter didn't understand the concept of a coupon and charged us regular price. We didn't bother with arguing over it because there was a line building behind us. The location isn't the best location. A lot of people that came in wanted to use the restroom but knew the rule of having to purchase something in order to use the facilities. Next time I crave chicken I'd go to a different location.

The Renaissance festival is a must visit at least once for the experience. It's fun to see everyone dressed up and in character.  The food was priced high as expected with any festival food. Parking is free but there traffic going there. Since the highway there is only two lanes, one of those is dedicated to entrance to the festival. Be sure to purchase tickets at your local Fry's grocery to save the extra bucks.

Ikea is awesome. Although we have only one in the valley making the trip there provides lots of ideas for the home. I really appreciated the service area for children. You can drop off your child for approximately 1 hour so adults can shop alone. My sister and I left my nephew there and when we came back he was more than happy to shop the first floor with us. It gives adults a break.

This is by far one of my favorite places to have breakfast.  To eat here you must have time to wait. I've always had to wait for a seat.  But the up side is that the food is decently priced and the portions are large enough to share between two.  I'm always trying something different when I visit. The menu has a great selection of choices.  I would definitely recommend this place.

Thought I'd give this new place a try located across the street from Target. I've driven by before and it looked new and hip. I must say I'd rather go to Panda Express than eat here and I don't go to Panda Express anymore. The food is cooked by amateurs. I ordered the Dan Dan noodles that come extra spicy. All the spice really is, is Sambal sauce. Like scoops of it. If I wanted noodles with Sambal sauce I could have made my own at home and it would have tasted 10 times better.
