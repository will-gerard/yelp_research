Three of us arrived on a Sunday for breakfast and there was no one to take your name or create a list of who had arrived first, which caused some chaos.   There were two groups in front of us who were doing some minor squabbling with each other over who should get the next available table. I walked in to the main counter, and a waiter approached me. He told me it would 10-15 mins for my party of three.  I went back to the patio and waited in line. A man and his parents arrived after us, asked me where they should put their name down, and I told him to just inform a waiter you're here.  After about 20 minutes (and now that we're next in line) a table opened up and the man with his parents just walked over and sat down. I followed, told him we were next in line and he just responded, "There is no 'real' line."  That guy was clearly a schmuck, but the reason it happened was Vincent Market Bistro had no system to create a list for who should be seated in order of arrival. Considering that even the IHOP has mastered this concept, one would hope Vincent can get a grip on it going forward.  To be fair, the manger came over later and apologized and gave us a mountain of free deserts. But, he had no real response as to why there isn't a host or hostess to keep people happy.  The croissants are amazing, the ham and Gruyere omelette was average, and the service was decent (once we were seated, which we did ourselves since no one offered to seat us at anytime.)  Kinda crazy, but for the hassle involved, I'd rather just go to Snooze down the street. It's an hour wait there, but at least they have a hostess.

My office is close to the "Book Gallery" and I have always wanted to swing by and check it out. I eventually did a few weeks ago, and I'm really glad I did.  The selection of rare books is really quite amazing. I have to give a shout-out to the man who helped me, Randy, who not only had an amazing knowledge about their offerings, but also had a genuine enthusiasm for them. I picked up a few books, but I'll definitely be back. A fantastic place to pick out a special gift for a friend.

I really enjoy Chase's for breakfast. The omelets are really tasty, the service is always great, and the vibe is casual and laid back. A favorite.

My office co-workers and I have been going to Wanda's every single Wednesday morning since 2008. All 6 of us stopped last week, after 5 years, because the service has gotten ridiculously bad.  Wanda's goes through employees very quickly, because, from what we've been told by a number of waitresses, the owner is a complete jerk. The newest round of employees, probably disgruntled, do not even try.  You'll never get a refill on your coffee, iced tea, or soda. What makes this ridiculous is the place is so small and never busy. The wait staff mostly sits in the kitchen, and many times recently I've had to go back there to find them to get a refill.  Wish we could still go there, but instead we've switched to U.S. Egg down the street.

I recently went to lunch at Espos, and engaged in an epic battle for a churro.  As I approached the counter to get my chorizo burrito and churro, the churro was missing and a plate of sopapillas was there instead. Before I could say anything, the woman behind the counter said bluntly, "We're out of churros, so I gave you sopapillas."  I thought about it for a second, and realized only a churro was really worth the extra flab my friends would see at the pool that weekend, and told her, politely, I'd really just prefer to not have sopapillas.  "You just want your dollar back?" she barked, as if I had asked her to drive to the U.S. treasury to collect one. I said yeah, I just love churros, and don't think I need anything else.  She huffed to the register, grabbed a dollar, and handed it to me.  Now look, one doesn't want to be petty, but really, the churro (after tax) costs $1.26. As I looked at her face that was saying, "Why couldn't you just eat your damn sopapillas like I told you to?" it occurred to me I shouldn't have to pay Espos twenty-six cents for a churro I never got.  "I think it was a $1.15 on the menu," I said.  Oh man, now she was pissed. Saying nothing, she hit a few buttons on the register, "returned" a churro officially, and handed me $1.26.  All of that drama might be worth it, if the chorizo didn't taste as bland as watery ground beef. Sorry, Espos, I'll just drive to Someburros a block away.

Always packed (part of the reason I like going) but difficult to find a table. Most people are working on a project (for school, work, ect) and I like that vibe when I need to get something done.  Coffee is decent, but although many would probably be offended that they even offer it, I like that I can just grab a large diet soda when I want it.  Furniture is often gunky and dirty (and sometimes the clientele is too.)

Stop charging for refills, Ted's. That worked in 1985, but we all know soda costs you less than a penny.  I like the food a good amount, and it's incredibly petty, but I just hate feeling like Ted's is ripping its customers off when literally every other fast-food/casual restaurant stopped doing this two decades ago.

Great local place that has a flavorful, solid menu, and an attentive staff. I go here once a week and get either a chorizo cheese crisp, beef enchiladas, or a chimichanga. They're always busy and they're the best casual Mexican food in the Valley.

We went for lunch, after checking out their website.  Their website and the window right by the front door says they offer sirloin and lamb burgers for $8-10, and a meat sampler for $8.  Our waitress came and she explained we could either do the salad bar for $10 or the meat "buffet" and salad bar for $20, with no mention of the burgers or meat sampler. When I asked about the burgers, she said they no longer offer that. When I asked about the meat sampler she (sorta begrudgingly) agreed that still was offered.  We got the meat "buffet", and it was decent enough. My main issue is if your lunch menu has been drastically cut down, take it off your website and off your front-window. It borders on bait-and-switch when you only tell your customers about the $20 option, never mention the $8 sampler option, and remove $8 burgers without telling anyone.

Someburros has amazing chorizo, enchiladas, chimichangas, salads, churros, and pretty much anything else you'd want. I love their original Tempe restaurant, and the Chandler restaurant is just as good.  The staff is great and the place is clean and inviting. I couldn't love it more (I come almost once a week.)

Great wings and I love how late they're open all week long. Sometimes after 10 the music can be ear-bleedingly too loud, but that's not too often. A good pic for late night food and a place to hang out on weekday nights.

Jeff arrived with his son to my home on a Sunday morning very soon after my call. He was friendly, and he was teaching his son a bit of the tools of the trade. His son actually opened the lock (in under 15 seconds, using manual lock picking tools.) The price was fair ($50), the time from call to arrival quick, and the general service was great. Jeff owns the business, he's the one that takes your call, is the one who shows up, and is the one who does the work. He even made me a new key, right on the spot, for free. A great guy, and I will recommend him to anyone that asks.

On May 2, 2013 a group of friends and I came here to grab a burger before a movie.  Four of us became incredibly ill only hours after eating here and we were all sick for 3-4 days afterward. Two of the other members who came with us did not get ill.  Apologies, I would have written something more timely, but just getting around to it now. I've eaten at other Red Robin's before and never had an issue. It appears it's just this location.

One of the greatest bone-in ribeyes of my life. I've traveled the country eating my way through some of the best ribeyes one can find, and yet still BLT Steak just hits it home. Also, the pop-overs they serve are incredible. This is my go-to place in the valley for an amazing steak.

I love Hillside for breakfast and come whenever I can.  The meat they use is of a very high quality, and makes everything amazing. The Levain bread is really fantastic. Basically everything food related is great.  The problem, as many have noted, is in Hillside's service. I've had a number of servers who have been very good, so it's not a systemic issue.   But, that being said, there are a number of servers who are about as bad as it gets. They won't come to take your order until you've been there almost 15 minutes. They drop the food off and you'll never see them again unless you flag them down and almost yell to them. These folks aren't unfriendly, but they're also not exactly caring about your experience.  So, you're left with the feelings that I have: hope that Yelp gets the management weeds out the poor servers, so this place can be the 5 stars it should be.

They use antibiotic and hormone free meat, and give you so many topping choices that you can really create a customized experience. They were also quite friendly and the place had a fun vibe. I'll be back.

I had a plumbing emergency today. A pipe behind my shower had a leak and started spraying, and I jumped on Yelp to find someone to help. Eric answered himself and I was extremely lucky that he was able to come within a half-hour of my call.  He came, fixed the problem quickly, and is clearly a straight-shooting guy. I was very impressed. The cost was also incredibly reasonable. I would highly recommend Hansen's Plumbing Service. I'll be using Eric now as my plumber for any and all needs. If you're having an issue right now, stop looking at Yelp and just call Eric.

The pizza and calzones are great, the service is solid, the atmosphere is hip, the selection at the bar is great, and the price is right. I'm dying for a calzone right now (they're my favorite, hands down) but they've got a great selection of salads as well.

The menu is honest and clear: no substitutions. That being said, I couldn't help it. My heart wanted the one omelette option on the menu to be a chorizo omelette instead of a potato omelette. When I asked for the change, the portly hipster behind the counter gave me that look. The one that says, "dude, we're so popular right now we don't have to give you anything."  He told me they aren't able to change a thing. I ordered the waffle, bacon, and potoatoes, with a side of scrambled eggs. The waffle wasn't my favorite kind (I prefer one that's crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside). This waffle was just soft, like a pancake. The eggs were typical. Not fluffy air goodness, like I always hope eggs will be. Bacon was limp and fatty.  Sometimes I feel like a breakfast spot like this gets its high ratings mostly because it tries very hard to be unique and trendy, less than because the food is actually delicious. But I'll be honest: I've never craved a pork chop in my breakfast, and this place isn't changing my mind on that front.   If you're wanting pancakes and the like (basically dessert) then you're going to love their options here. But c'mon, you could go to a million hip places in the valley that offer a carb-rich, sugar filled pancake and be thrilled. The real posers of breakfast are revealed in how they do the non-carb options. Sorry Vovomeena. For me, you're nothing more than a hipster poser. Great coffee though.

I've already come to Biscuits about 20 times since they've opened, and I can say that they excel in everything I would hope for in a breakfast place: the food is great, the service strong, the atmosphere clean and inviting, and the wait not overwhelming.  All of the french toast options are amazing (especially the Almond crusted kind) and the omelettes are solid (although the chorizo is on the mild side if you're opting for that.)  I love this place and hope it has a long and successful future.

Our office goes to Pak Afghan at least once a week and it's not hard to see why: the amazing food and excellent customer service. I've tried, at this point, almost everything on the menu, and everything is always fresh, delicious, and authentic.  Some of my favorites are the Bandanjan Eggplant, Goat Karahi, and the Chicken Byrani, but the menu is solid all-around.  We've gotten to know the owners just because of the sheer amount of times we go and they are really delightful and always incredibly friendly.

We sat on the patio and it's really an attractive looking spot. Romantic and cute. The appetizer was delicious, our cocktails were strong and tasty, and my entree (the flank steak) was pretty solid. I wouldn't say amazing. I probably wouldn't order it again. But, for that moment in time, it did what it needed to do.  My only complaint? It's a weird one. I kept getting hit by water. I was very confused for the first ten minutes. I kept telling my girlfriend that it was raining and she thought I was crazy. At one one point a giant drop hit my right hand, and she saw it happen (thank god.) The waiter, walking by me, must have overheard me say something about it and he causally mentioned, as he continued to briskly walk by our table, "there's a pool on the roof."  The couple next to us suddenly piped up, and told us that they too had been getting sprinkled with pool water all night.  When the pool water hit my dinner plate, I started to wonder, "why aren't they telling people about this?" I mean look, it's one thing to have a pool above your customers that's drizzling on them. It's another to ask "inside or outside" without casually mentioning, "oh, the front row is in the Shamu splash zone." Just tell people, Virtù! That way we can make an informed decision.

My initial experience with Arcadia required me to wait 50 minutes after my appointment time. I filled out this patient satisfaction survey and was contacted by Arcadia a day later. Arcadia offered me a second visit at the $40 introductory price. I accepted.  6 months later I come to my appointment, having forgotten about the "deal" I was offered. I explained to the manager who greeted me that I was here for a free cleaning. She immediately, and rather rudely and bluntly, corrected my error. "I'm the manager here, and I would never approve a free cleaning!" she snapped at me. I apologized and said I might have been mistaken, that perhaps she could check my file. She did and discovered my offer had been $40. She also made the point to me that, "the dentist and hygienist from your last visit are no longer with us," presumably to comfort me.  I proceeded with my cleaning. Before the cleaning officially began my hygienist, Ms. Briggs, gave me a minute or so pitch on why I should buy a Sonicare from their office. When I mentioned buying it off Amazon, she stressed that if I purchased it from their office, I would receive a 2-year warranty, and that their Sonicare was the newer version, as opposed to Costco. It is a weird feeling to have to turn down a saleswoman who is inevitably going to be cleaning your mouth for the next 45-minutes. Your dentist's office shouldn't be pushing Sonicares like a street vendor. If you want to offer them, that's fine, but it shouldn't require a patient to have to (multiple times) turn down your sales pitch. After I turned her down I then spent the next 45 minutes dealing with one of the most painful cleanings I've ever had. When I was done Ms. Briggs informed me that I should expect to be "sore" tomorrow because of how bad my gums were. Every time I spit, for about an hour after, my spit was rust colored from blood.  I'm 31 years old. I've gone to two other dentists for the duration of my life, one of whom, Dr. Michael J. Cooley of Chandler, is rated as a top Arizona dentist. I tried Arcadia because it's next to my new office. With that being said, I've never had a cleaning that was anywhere near as painful as what I received, nor have I ever had a hygienist tell me I was going to be sore for the next few days, nor have I ever been spitting blood out for hours. Ms. Briggs then, at the conclusion of my cleaning, informed me she'd like to schedule my next appointment in "4 months" because that was how bad the situation in my mouth apparently was. Again, not one dentist or hygienist has ever, in my entire life, ever recommended I come every 4 months.  The conclusion I've reached: Arcadia "Modern" Dentistry is in fact very modern, if we assume that "modern" means focusing more on profits than people, firing dentists and hygienists because they're just cogs in the profit-making apparatus, attempting to get you to come 3 times a year to boost their profits, and trying to make a hard-sell on Sonicare's as you're propped back in a chair with a bib on. I'm going back to my old dentist. Sure he's not close to my work, but his office isn't owned by some corporation. It's just him and his name is on the door. If the future of dentistry is making the experience of going to the dentist like buying a car or life-insurance, I'll take the old-fashioned approach over Arcadia's "Modern" dentistry any day of the week.  UPDATE: Upon posting my review I was contacted by Arcadia Modern Dentistry the next day. They told me they saw my Yelp review, were sorry I felt the way I did, and would be refunding my $40 cleaning fee. They assured me my feelings concerning their business practices are not accurate. I do appreciate that they reached out to me.

The reason for my low stars is to draw attention to the fact that this Bosa location has their large iced coffee priced at $3.98 cents. That's the same price Starbucks charges for a extra large cold brew coffee, which brews for 24 hours.   Other Bosa locations charge $2.49 to $2.98 for their large iced coffee, which is reasonable. But when you're paying $4 for a iced coffee, you should be at Carrel Coffee, or Hazelrock, or even Starbucks. Not a donut shop where the iced coffee is churned out like a factory. I like Bosa, but in terms of coffee, it's bottom of the barrel in quality. They should be the cheapest ice coffee in town, not the most expensive.

I've already gone to the Biscuits location in Chandler about 30 times since they've opened, and I was happy when I saw this new location in Tempe closer to my house. This location is a walk-up, counter system, which I actually really like.

I personally love the Farmer's Daughter burger. That with a individually brewed ice tea really is great on a hot day. It's a fun little spot and if you don't mind sitting at the counter with you friends, it can be great for a quick lunch.  I'm excited for the fall when sitting outside on the patio won't be horrible and then the seating will effectively more than double. I come here probably one a week for a bite, and hope you'll check it out.

There is an "executive chef" of Ingo's who comes by once in a while (he's got a unique hairstyle, so that's how you'll notice him.) Our main complaint with him is although he doesn't ever actually make the food, once it's set out for the waitresses to grab and serve it, he'll randomly come by and just touch the food for no reason. It's very bizarre. He basically just walks by and "taps" your burger buns like he's hitting bongo drums. That might be just a weird little tic that one could overlook if his hands were clean. Unfortunately my party and I once watched him take out the trash, then, without washing his hands, walk right over and start doing his "burger bun tapping." If you don't have to touch the food, don't touch the food. And if you're going to touch the food for no reason, please wash your hands before you do it.  That being said, I personally love the Farmer's Daughter burger. That with a individually brewed ice tea really is great on a hot day. It's a fun little spot and if you don't mind sitting at the counter with you friends, it can be great for a quick lunch.

The staff at the counter was nice and the food was mediocre. The main thing that killed the entire experience was that we arrived at 8pm (their hours are 6am to 9pm) and by 8:20, when we went for a refill, they had shut the entire soda machine down and were stacking chairs. When we wanted a refill they had to actually put they nozzles back on the soda machine to allow us to get a refill.  I think you need to at least stay open the hours posted on your door, and not rush the people who just paid to eat at your restaurant out the door. We were the only people eating when we went, and although the server was friendly, you need to stay open the hours you say you will. No one wants to eat while the place is being shut down. If you want to close early, you need to say so.

I love the friend chicken and the fun cocktails, but mostly I enjoy the vibe. They've done a great job creating a swank atmosphere, and I like knowing that I can always go and grab a drink at the back bar while I wait for my table. A fantastic place to bring friends for an entire evening of drinks, booze, and maybe some games. I think the food is mostly solid, but you're not coming necessarily for a "culinary" experience. You're coming for the vibe. And it's a good one.

Amazing cold brew and cold drip coffee. The vibe is solid, the coffee is great, and the folks behind the counter are friendly and incredibly helpful. I was given a few samples on my first visit, which helped point me in the right direction, and now I've gone back every morning this week.  My only wish is that they would stay open until 8pm on Saturdays. This is definitely the place I'd like to hang out with a cold brew and relax before heading to Four Peaks.

This is exactly the coffee shop I've been waiting for. The cold brew selection is fantastic and the coffee is delicious beyond reason. The vibe of Hazelrock is what I'm always looking for: fun and hip, but also laid back.  I love a place where I can pull out a laptop and get some work done but also just chill and relax with a friend over coffee.  It can't be overstated how flavorful and rich the coffee is. I really enjoy Cartel, but as far as I'm concerned, nothing in Tempe is beating Hazelrock right now.

I live a few blocks away and I love breakfast, so I'm really pulling for this place to get their act together. This review is aimed squarely at management. I want your restaurant to survive! Stop making this so hard!  I've gone to the Farmer's Ave Over Easy three times. Each visit was on a Sunday. Each visit it wasn't particularly busy.  1) The food is pretty solid. That's why I'm pulling for them to right this ship.  2) Both times the service has been beyond bad. Despite us each time being the server's only table, we couldn't get a drink refill to save our lives. The servers all look particularly unhappy and miserable. Perhaps the manager isn't easy to work with, but they drop off your first round of drinks, and then you're left to literally wave them down each time you want more diet coke or water. I had to wave down our waitress three times this last Sunday to get a refill on my diet coke (the cups are very, very small.) The waitresses are all behind the large counter and they seem to be more preoccupied with counting receipts, or wrapping silverware, or being on their phones. They don't look up. They don't even talk to each other. They look pretty unhappy to be at Over Easy.  3) This last visit I went to order an omelet and the waitress told me they were out of bacon and ham. Pretty much the only thing more ridiculous for a breakfast place to be out of would be eggs. It's bacon and ham! That's like half your menu, gone!  Honestly, if I didn't know better, I would think they're trying to make this place go out of business. The food isn't as good as Tempe favorite NCounter, but Over Easy is at least as good as Tempe's Snooze. The difference is that a) Snooze hasn't run out of bacon and ham, and b) Snooze's servers apparently don't hate their jobs.

A few of my friends and I, after having a relatively underwhelming experience at their Scottsdale location, decided to try and give the Indian school locale a shot. We arrived on a Saturday night, around nine, so that a few of us could have a beer and the others a coffee. We saw a decent looking crowd inside, but as we approached we discovered a sign that notified us that Sip was closed for a private party. We came back a few weeks later, and watched as the owner sat at the bar, hanging out and taking loudly like a frat boy, and found his demeanor to be fairly annoying. At first we thought he was just an loud customer, but only later realized he and his wife are in fact the owners. I can't say that the coffee was anything special, but I can say that I won't be returning, because the odds are either that the place will be closed when they should be open to the public or you'll be sitting around listening to the owner as if he's in his own living room.

Bottom line: the food is average for the vibe/price point they're going for here. You're better off going to LGO for a better tasting option in the same genre.  I ordered an egg/bacon sandwich which was fine, but average. My girlfriend's salad had old avocado and was generally bland and unexciting. The chicken in the salad was particularly dry and unappetizing.  You can't spend more money on decorating and establishing the look of your restaurant's brand than you do on the food.
