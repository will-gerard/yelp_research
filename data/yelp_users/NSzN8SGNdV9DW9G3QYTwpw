A wonderful experience. I experienced Zenlike atmosphere, immediately upon entering. Gentle soothing music and the sound of gentle ocean waves . Salt lamps to purify the air and give a nice energy to the Spa.  I was there for 3 hours. One for Facial. one for Massage, and one for the body scrub. They are concerned with your comfort level and tailor your treatments to you personally. The ladies are warm, friendly and very good in their respective fields. This is a family business, Mom and daughters are exceptional and have proven themselves over many years there. I will be back again, and purchase gift certificates for my family as well. Nice work, ladies!

If I could give this a ZERO, I would. We have been customers for many, many, years.                 The service is now, and has always been, terrible. Nothing has changed. They still don't get it.  We were not acknowledged when we came in. but everyone after me, was. (Not out of the ordinary here)       I found what I needed, asked for help ( as I needed some things from inside a case).  I was told by the young woman it would be just a minute. Her arms were full of clothes, so naturally I waited until she could put them on the rack.        She then proceeded to the register to help a man who walked up AFTER I had asked for her assistance.  I was patient and waited for the transaction to be completed. At this point it had been ten minutes, waiting.       She then proceeded to help yet another random customer, still not acknowledging that I was still waiting, never an explanation as to why she was allowing me to stand there.  It had been 15 minutes and that is unreasonable wait time, and completely unacceptable in any business setting, EXCEPT for Name Brand Exchange, apparently. I put down what I had and we left. Even then no one noticed us leave in disappointment.   We did not have time to just waste that way. We went to a real store, made our purchases and went on our way. = Lost sales for you.  She might have told me "its our policy to help those at the register, first." And ya know?     Thats fine... IF you don't already have a customer waiting for help. I have been asked to wait at registers in other stores for someone who was there first. I have no problem with that.         Thats the way it should be.  It would have taken a moment to say Im sorry- I'm coming, or I'll be with you shortly.            Say "something" to your customer!!!!   The CUSTOMER WAITING, IS JUST AS IMPORTANT TO YOUR BUSINESS AS THE ONE AT THE REGISTER.     YOU HELP THE PERSON WHO IS FIRST, FIRST. period.    If your business cannot accommodate this simple request, perhaps you should look into hiring extra help.  I called the Manager/Owner, Vanessa, to tell her of our disappointment today, and over the years.  I explained this was NOT good customer service. Vanessa was not at all understanding, but defensive and argumentative, stating policy verbatim, rudely and aggressively talking over me,  never indicating any concern at all for how we were treated.  This is how they do things at Name Brand Exchange   She is the owner and the manager yet has no respect for the "would be" customers.  Vanessa was in NO way apologetic for the bad experience. She went as far as to tell me she would "trespass me" (her words) because she didn't like what I was saying. Laughably not necessary, there is no danger of me returning. I can afford to pay full price, Idk why we even  went there.  * Their buyers are masters at ripping you off for your quality "name brand" items, you, the customers all know it.  It makes everyone mad, yet only some of you Yelp it.   Think you are saving money?, yeah, we did too, just make sure you have plenty of time to kill.  Name Brand Exchange you need to rethink your policy. Instead of help the people at the register first, how about "First come, first serve".   Every other store in the world already "knows" that policy, and guess what? Its reasonable and acceptable to all.   Shame on you Vanessa, you are an owner/manager. Because you can behave this way, does not mean you should.

Last Sunday, I went in to Pep Boys to arrange for her tires and wheels to be put-on. The GM, Debbie, was rude and condescending to me, and the same treatment was given her employee. She is a know it all, and was sighing in disgust as though the employee and I were bothering her in asking for her assistance/direction.  She acted as though my very presence was an inconvenience to her because she was just "so busy". NOT. She was not busy, just had a very bad attitude. I left there feeling sorry for the employee and disgusted that someone like this continues to be left in authority. FYI She gave, no, she insisted that she was right, and proceeded to instruct the employee incorrectly- My tires did NOT contain the type of valves that have to be removed. I am the original owner of the car and it did not come with electronic sensors. This person has no business dealing with the customer, nor should she be training anyone.  I will take my business elsewhere and tell everyone else I know to do the same, until I see a new manager running things at 7715 E Main St. Mesa, AZ 85207

Just got home from Las Vegas. I have never had such a wonderful dining experience.  Stack. The staff,  the service, the quality and taste of food was excellent! A perfect experience from the moment we arrived til we said our goodbyes.  We will absolutely return to the Mirage, and best server ever, Scott.  The Stack is our new favorite place .

WAY TOO MANY FLIES INSIDE.  Disgusting. So distracted by them I couldn't say how the food was. A real shame, waste of a very charming place.

If I could leave NO stars, I would. Extremely rude server, start to finish. The rudest server I have encountered in my entire life. She raised her voice to me when I asked for an appetizer in addition to my order (as I often eat an appetizer as a main meal). It was my daughters birthday too. Three of us for lunch, upon ordering, she barked at me "YOU ORDA !!"  I was confused by her anger at that moment and didn't understand the tone, nor her demeanor as she was clearly frustrated and actually ANGRY with me and slammed her pad and things down on our table and sighed heavily. She was VERY SLOW and we felt it deliberate, she sure wasn't busy. Only one or two other customers in there at the time. When she would come to the table she would motion with her hands to my daughter (who was kindly stacking plates in order to assist her), to hurry up!!!  We were offered no dessert. When we asked for boxes it took forever and she was just standing there thinking she was out of sight but we were watching her do nothing. We asked her for the check, this also took a long long time, we waited for her to pick the check up, and she was still doing nothing.  once again, deliberate. My daughter, had cash and paid the $51.00 tab for lunch on HER BIRTHDAY just so we could get out of there!!! We left an undeserved tip of $3.14. I reimbursed my daughter but fully intend to visit the manager there and have my money fully refunded - and in addition, the $3.14 can come out of her check. She gets nothing, but fired (if I have anything to say about it). I have been in the food & beverage industry my entire life and have NEVER experienced such BAD service experience. Food was OK, but She left a 'bad taste" in our mouths, and clearly has NO business dealing with the public.

There is always a certain fear in going to the dentist. I was greeted by a young lady with a bright energy, perfect for greeting people. She immediately handed me a beautiful royal blue Brighton Dental Cup. The staff was friendly and explained what they were doing as far as the preliminary exam, Xrays etc. It was a challenge for them as I have a small mouth, they had to use child Xray film but did an excellent job of obtaining the necessary views. Dr. Yu was very kind with a gentle nature. He was genuinely concerned with my anxieties regarding my dental treatment. He allowed me to explain my concerns and immediately put some of my fears to rest. He was confident and I was able to relax. The staff then worked with me as far as putting me on the path to obtaining better health insurance. and went as far as providing me a 10% discount...

I wish I could give this location a ZERO. I have a family plan with 9 lines, bought all iphone 6 plusses, and each an expensive case, not to mention previous ipad purchase, etc.  My daughter went in to have them remove the extra protective glass piece they put on, as it was coming loose where the rep had put the tape to adhere it in the first place. This is normal wear and tear and less than 1 month. She was told by the lady (Rosie) with me standing there,  that if we had any trouble to come back. This issue happened while out of town and she took it in upon her return home.  The man was leaning on the counter, did not offer an "I'm sorry", not even a shallow one, said she had to file a claim with Zag, she explained that it was not broken and Zag does not cover normal wear and tear anyway. They put it on, no one asked them to.  He told her snidely that they did it for her as a courtesy, and it is my feeling that this was not a courtesy but an injustice that needs to be corrected immediately. He identified himself as a store manager. Not good to see a store manager leaning on the counter. Bad example for employees. My daughter mumbled "this is ridiculous" and headed for the door. She held the door for a woman and her daughter, and said they are useless in there, and left. She was already off the sidewalk and into the parking lot when the manager came bursting out and told her she was not welcome back in that store.  I have news for you, Jeff, I'm on my way to the store right now and we will see who isn't coming back to that store. The customer is always right.  I have emailed the regional southwest president, Eric Reed,  (for those of you who'd like to do the same.)  I would like to say there are 3 outstanding reps that I know of, over there, Jason, Rosie and Dwight. If you must go to this location, ask for one of these reps. You will have a positive experience.

Verbal abuse,, harassment, racial bullying, theft of tips, incorrect paychecks, threats at the job and most recently (immediately after sending this email requesting assistance), threats on my daughters personal cell phone. I emailed corporate for help as this has become a dangerous situation. Corporate Customer Service Denise Lujan took it upon herself to forward my email directly to the very people who are abusing my daughter. I had to have the police come, as one of the servers,  (Jerilyn Johnson) called my daughters cellphone and told her "next time I see you, your ass, is mine. "  Its like IHOP HIgh School. Grown women threatening young girls of another race. AND Hey, Good job Corporate thanks for the help. I am now going over your heads to the head of Romulus restaurants District Manager, and then to Dine Equity and I will not stop until the Manager, who "coincidentally"? has the last name as the CS rep I emailed for help, yes, Lujan. Is it a Coincidence?, I think not.  You guys had better get your ducks in a row, I am a member of Legal Shield and my local attorneys are on retainer. Lets get her schedule changed for now, and transfer these bullies out of there. In the meantime I will continue to let people know who you are and what you are doing and not over there on Signal Butte and Southern. Feel free to scroll further to find the manager of this location ( Melissa's) review about her own IHOP. Really?

ZERO. Rude, Unprofessional. Undermines and slanders the very Drs. referring them. Charges for cancellation, even when it was due to injury at the hands of their hygienist, Sandy. No apologies offered from Stephanie Walker, or Sandy.

I had to choose one star as there is no ZERO. We stayed at the Mirage in Vegas last weekend. We enjoyed the hotel and saw a show. I play My Vegas and used my 30k points for $30 off Dinner at the heritage steakhouse. The hostesses were both extremely rude, took us to a dirty table in the bar after we had told her we wanted dinner. She left us standing at the dirty table for a while, smiled and sarcastically said 'you can stand there until someone cleans it for you" then I saw the hostess go to the server and direct him to a table in the bar that had been sat after us. I was upset and immediately went to him and said we needed to be acknowledged, our table cleaned, and we should provided a menu. He grabbed a menu and threw it down on the dirty table at us. It landed next to the check from the previous table. The three of us immediately got up and went to the Concierge who directed us to the front desk manager. The front desk manager offered us a $75 credit at the Stack Steakhouse in the hotel. He sent us each a delicious complimentary shot from the bar, and personally came to check on us. I cannot say enough about how badly Heritage treated us.  SKIP TOM COLICCHIO"S HERITAGE STEAKHOUSE!!!! WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!

Tom Karmo at PCM, assisted our family with three consecutive home purchases for our family. My daughter, myself, and most recently, my son. He is the absolute best at what he does, I was kept informed every step of the way and I am thrilled I did not waste time somewhere else.  If there were six stars available, he would have six.  Peace of mind knowing your purchase is being handled with your best interests at heart, and done in a timely manner. In some cases, well ahead of expectation.  I will absolutely call Tom again when it comes time for my youngest daughter to make her first home purchase.  Thank you Tom, and PCM     ;)
