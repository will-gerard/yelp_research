Everything I've ever had here is excellent (I've probably eaten here about 10 times).  The "Gr√ºben" is my favorite (grilled turkey, swiss, slaw, spicy mustard, rye bread), but chicken roll-ups are a close second.  They offer a great selection of sides, and the fruit is always fresh. The limeade is so worth it in my opinion, though I don't think you get refills on that.  (Note if you buy a big cup you can bring it back for a deal on the limeade.)  Also note that if you check in on your Yelp phone app, Zoe's gives 10% off; every 3 check-ins gets you a free piece of chocolate cake. I'm a fan of the cake as are many others, though my wife didn't care for it.  Oh, and the parking: very tough to get right now with the construction next door. If you wait a few minutes you should get a space in the lot and won't have to park around the corner. (I haven't tried parking in the costume store lot.)

Met a friend here for lunch & had a great experience. I've been meaning to get here for a while, having heard great things. Unfortunately didn't get to sample the wine menu. But the lunch offerings were good - turkey sandwich was very flavorful with its crumbled goat cheese, vinaigrette, and fig jam on 9-grain bread. Such a large sandwich runs the risk of being dry, but no problem here. My friend got to enjoy the sausage mac & cheese; I was tempted by some of the other versions on the menu - next time for sure. Also, the place wasn't too crowded for lunch - no problems getting a table or parking.

This is the kind of place that looks runs down but that's not a bad thing. Wings are small but tasty and reasonably priced ($6.40 for a pound,  $10 for 1.5 pounds,  $18.15 for 3 pounds, and you only get 1 flavor for those; for a bucket at $34.35 you get 6 orders, with 2 flavors). They come with nice, crisp carrots, but ranch is extra (. 40 for a small, $1.60 for large). They also have burgers, Order ahead for faster service.

A trip to Schnep Farms for the October "Pumpkin & Chili Party" has been a family tradition for us almost every year for the last 7 or so years; it's always a great time. From what we've heard this is the best event like this in the area. Best parts include the face painting, roller coaster, pig races, the spooky train (at night), corn maze, hay ride.... Other highlights: kettle corn, pies (on the way out), fresh-made lemonade. Food is overpriced (as you'd expect), it's usually very dusty, and finding your car in the dark can be a nightmare (make sure you remember where you parked, or use an app like Car Locator), But the kids have a blast.

Co-workers & I have been coming here on-and-off for years, & have never been disappointed. I had the chicken parm for the 1st time yesterday - an excellent sandwich that maintained its flavor when I took it back to the office. (Probably a bit less sauce & a bit more cheese than I'd prefer, but that's just my taste.)  I've had a couple salads & a few pizzas & have liked them all. We don't come here nearly as often as Z Pizza (which is a few doors down), primarily because of the credit card issue -- currently (for lunch at least) they don't accept cards under $10, and lots of people rarely carry cash anymore. (The policy has gotten better over the years.) Pino's also charges extra for pretty much everything - refills, sauce, etc. I can understand the policies - this is not a chain & as far as I know it's still locally owned, so they probably need to watch their bottom line. Still, the policies affect people's willingness to go there, which is a shame, because the food is great.  (Note: parking is tight in front but there's more in back.)

Everything here for lunch was amazing.  Great eggplant parm sandwich (recommended by the waitress) on that saltimbocca bread.  One friend had a sausage sandwich and another friend (vegetarian) had his usual, caprese sandwich; both raved about their food.  Price is right at about $9 per sandwich.  Too bad they don't serve pizza for lunch; I'll have to come back some time for dinner. We didn't have any problem parking or getting in (maybe a 10 minute wait for lunch, not bad), but maybe we just got lucky. I also really like the setting in an old house.

Don't be fooled by the (not-so-appealing) purple exterior and sign out front; this is a cool, stylish place inside with some quality food. I went for lunch and enjoyed the mole chicken enchiladas -- outstanding, though the portion was small for $9.99. Chips with fresh guacamole and salsas was a good choice; otherwise I probably would have been hungry after. It only came with a few chips (not enough), but they brought more as soon as we asked. A friend got the black bean sauce enchiladas (I think) and seemed happy; he said his tortilla soup was tasty but could have used some vegetables or something, because for most of it he was just spooning broth. He seemed a lot happier about the margarita; there are a lot of options for quality ones there. No problems with service. The place was empty at prime lunch time.

One of my all-time quick lunch spots in Phoenix (both this and the McDowell location). Love the Grueben (grilled turkey, swiss, slaw, spicy mustard, rye) and chicken roll-ups (tortillas, feta, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, salsa). To me it's a great marriage of Mediterranean and American, with a little Southwestern and Mexican flair. I also really like the limeade; go for the large cup and get refills anytime you visit for 99 cents. Chocolate cake is great too. It's a little pricier than average lunches and portions are slightly smaller, but way tastier. Note that parking is way easier here; it's become very difficult at the McDowell location. Another tip - if you're on Foursquare, sign in your first time and get 10% off.

I (and co-workers; friends) have eaten here so many times over the last 6 years that it's about time that I write a review. Everything I've had here is great; I highly recommend the California salad, add chicken; balsamic dressing.  But every pizza I've had here is great too (a rotating selection), as is the Caesar.  I've also had a sandwich now and again and can't complain. Every once in a while the pizza has been sitting there a little while and is a little dry, but that's pretty rare, especially given the number of times I've eaten there. And hey, every 20 times you get a free pizza - can't beat that. (OK, 20 times seems a little high...)

Great atmosphere -- very retro modern, clean, bright, airy. And the (smallish) coffee cake is outstanding, flavorful without overdoing it, though at $3 seems a bit overpriced.  Coffee is very good -- not the best I've had, but certainly better than overly-bitter Starbucks, and reasonably priced at $1.80 for a medium (I think).  My 4-year-old daughter loved her pink cupcake ($2.75), though she mostly just ate the frosting, so it's a little hard to give a recommendation one way or the other.  (I'm sure they're great, at least based on the "Cupcake Wars" video, in which Coffee Shop wins.)  My daughter said her hot chocolate was ok, but claimed it tasted a little like coffee -- though I'm hoping she doesn't really know what coffee tastes like.  All in all a nice place and worth a return.

Drive-through Greek, quick, cheap, open for lunch, and close to where I work? I'm there! For $8 I get stuffed with a chicken gyro with Greek salad (both with great dressings), and an iced tea. Did I mention drive-through?

Decent Thai place for lunch in downtown Phoenix. Yellow curry chicken was very good, and a friend, who eats there regularly, had good things to say about the Pad Thai. Not the best Thai I've ever had, but decent nonetheless.  My "Medium" wasn't really that spicy, and my friend said the "spicy" wasn't all that spicy either.

I've been very impressed with this place both times I've been here. Yesterday at the recommendation of an employee I got the Doc's sandwich - I can't remember the exact name and it's not listed online, but she was so right.  It's mesquite smoked turkey, spicy aioli, peporoncini, onions, on this outstanding pretzel bread, toasted. Just the right amount of zing to it, though it had a bit more aioli than I would have cared for. It's slightly pricey at 8.95, though it comes with a (small) side of fruit. The first time there I got the Smokey Joe (mesquite smoked turkey breast, smoked gouda, lettuce, onion, tomato & cilantro with garlic aioli - w/o bacon for me) - also very good.  Next time I go I'll have to try the coffee, and they do have a surprisingly large selection of bottled beer.  I really like what the owners did with the old Willow House, which I used to go to back in the day. When I first went to Hob Nobs I was kind of sad to see the old place change, but they did such a great job with the renovation that it's hard to complain.   As others have noted, the parking is very tight; I've gotten lucky, but I'm pretty sure there's a sign that says you can park across the street.  (By the way, for some reason Yelp has separate listings for "Hob Nobs" and "Hob Nobs Coffee House. Not sure why.)

I've been coming here the better part of the last 5 years with my Prius and have no complaints. I've used various service people over the years and all have been very courteous and fairly knowledgeable. I don't have the sense that they're trying to get me to spend any extra money that I don't have to (or, at least, no more than any other service place I've been to). One time a service rep recommended a whole bunch of work but told me there was no need to get it done immediately; I waited and didn't have any problems. So, as far as I can tell, they're honest. One time they fixed a tire for free (even though I get my tires at Discount). This place is on my way to work, which is convenient, and there are a few places to eat (Chik-fil-a etc.)  within walking distance if you're facing a wait. The facilities are nice enough if you have to stay a while; though the Gilbert (Big Two)  and Avondale locations are nicer, there's nothing wrong with this one.    I should also note that I didn't buy the Prius here, so I can't comment on the sales department.

Excellent place.  I've been here about 4 times and had a great experience every time.  The coffee is great - the lattes are way better than Starbucks (which I consider to be burnt, though I tolerate them when I can't go elsewhere). (Note: my favorite AZ coffee is Lux, but Bergie's is on par.)  The biscotti (locally made - Bad Boy Biscotti, I think) is fresh; it's soft for biscotti, which I like (though my wife prefers hard biscotti). There's not much of a selection of food otherwise, though there's plenty to eat in easy walking distance in Old Town Gilbert. The outside environment is very inviting (at least, when it's not summer). Parking in back is down a little alley reached by the side street just to the north; it can be a little tight but I haven't had a problem. Glad to see a local place doing well.

On my first visit, the delicious Mediterranean wrap outweighed my disappointment that they were out of the Sonoran. The ingredients taste fresh and the wrap is well made - it doesn't fall apart like wraps I've had at other places. Service was very courteous but slow - it took quite a while to take my order (even though only one person was in front of me) and then a while to make the wrap. Also on the down side, the wrap seems small for roughly $7. Granted, it comes with a side, but the fruit cup was also small. (The place offers several side options.) Also, selection of wraps is not as rich or interesting as It's a Wrap, but unfortunately that place moved up to Camelback from it's 7th St. location some time ago, so isn't quite as close for me. I hope All Wrapped Up does well here - there really aren't enough lunch spots in the area.

What a fantastic tuna sandwich (Sicilian Tuna Melt: preserved Sicilian tuna, capers, olives, cheddar, Romesco [sauce], arugula, $10.50) with salad. Very useful for a quick to-go lunch, though a bit higher priced than the average. Great atmosphere; I look forward to eating here and to ordering the pizza.

5 stars is based on one 2.5 hour visit so far, with a friend on a Sunday morning in January. Coffee, food, and atmosphere were excellent. My 16 oz. pour-over coffee ($3, Ethiopian, filled to the rim) was smooth and good enough to drink black, which I never do, though part-way through some bitterness showed through and  I added some half and half. (My favorite pour-over is probably Songbird.) Friend had an iced vanilla honey latte and had high praise for it. We both grabbed strawberry muffins ($3.50) and liked them; they were moist without being too much so. Atmosphere: very comfortable; it was easy to have a long conversation here; the floor to ceiling window has a nice, peaceful view. Clean; simple; modern. Wifi slows as it gets more crowded, which is to be expected. Parking is a hassle, but I'll be back.

Such a great place. Great sandwiches, beers (all reasonably priced; a small but worthwhile selection on tap, bigger selection in bottles and cans), great dog-friendly patio, great ambience inside and out, small selection of starters and salads. Roasted turkey sandwich with house-made jalape√±o cream cheese, local tomato, field greens on baguette, was tasty and filling (I took half home), and a friend liked his grilled cheese sandwich. Great happy hour prices. I also took mac & cheese (with chiles) home for my wife, who didn't care for it, but I did.

Overall I (and my 5 dinner companions) were very impressed with this place. As many others have noted, the pretzel fondue (provolone) ($10) is outstanding. The "crusty bread and good olive oil" ($2) is also very good. Main courses were mostly to everyone's liking - after chowing down on the pretzels and bread I was glad I ordered the Crispy Shrimp Caesar Salad ($13). Though crispy, the shrimp wasn't greasy, and the salad had just the right amount of dressing for my taste (not too much, not too little). My wife didn't have as much luck with the fried chicken -- too much honey flavor for her. We took the rest home and I ate it today; I agree, though the chicken itself is perfectly prepared. A friend who ordered it had the same experience.  I also liked the interesting selection of beers, including some locals (like the Four Peaks HopKnot IPA - very powerful flavor, very good; and the SanTan Epicentre American Amber - light but good; they also offer lots in cans, which apparently is all the rage). True, it's too loud, and service was great albeit overly attentive, and one could complaint about the price of the drinks (but it is Scottsdale, after all). But overall a positive experience; I'd go back, at the very least for the pretzels.

It doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is outstanding, and it's a great place for lunch. It offers free chips and a salsa bar, and the hardest part was limiting myself to just a few salsas. The 3 I had were great. Chicken mole torta (though they don't call it a torta) is rich and tasty, just right. I'm glad they offered a Groupon; I'll be back.

For those who don't eat beef (like me), there's a good selection of chicken and even a vegetarian option.  That's unlike 5 Guys, whose vegetarian option is toppings on a bun (still pretty good, but still...).  Smashburger's Arizona chicken burger (grilled) is quite good -- flat and kinda smashed (which makes sense), quality chicken, well cooked, Habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and jalape√±os on a spicy chipotle bun (I got mine without the jalape√±os - I figured I might be feeling that the rest of the afternoon in the office).  Sweet potato fries are very good (though I do like the ones at Lenny's a bit more).

Everybody raves about the carne asada and pastor, but we go for the bean and cheese burritos (no lard!), vegetarian quesadilla, and (for me) corn on the cob.  My kids are especially crazy about the bean and cheese burritos, and my youngest loves the vegetarian quesadilla -- flour tortilla with monterey jack cheese, lettuce, caramelized onions, guacamole. Corn on the cob is sweet white corn, lite mayo, cotija cheese, chili, lime.  Salsa is tasty and fresh -interestingly, it gets spicier if you leave it in the fridge overnight.  (Guac is just ok, in my opinion.) Also, order online for quick service.  For those wondering about the "America's" name, that's the name of one of the owners: http://www.americastacoshop.net/about

My biggest problem with Short Leash is that the Chicken Igby dog is so good that I haven't tried anything else. Sure, the other dogs look tempting, but a hot dog with BBQ sauce, blue cheese, and cole slaw is too good to pass up, and I crave it before I go. The chicken itself is high quality - slightly spicy, but not too much so. And the side of fried pickles ($3) is excellent and I have a hard time passing that up as well. Thankfully Short Leash goes to Urban Cookies every Tuesday for lunch, and that's just a couple miles from where I work. Of course, that means I may just have to stop in for a cookie as well...

Fairly generic, bland Mexican food. My wife's family went to the old location for years and they have fond memories of good food there. I was never a big fan, but tonight's meal ended it for us. Tacos were boring. Sangria was so bad that my mother-in-law sent it back. My chicken chimichanga was fine, nothing special, but not bad. My wife's flan had to be sent back. I didn't get a refill on water the entire meal. There are so many good - better - Mexican restaurants out there. On the plus side, I like the interior, and kids like the cheese crisps. Oh well.

Came here just for happy hour to meet a friend, so this review is not for dinner. Very disappointing. Their happy hour deal is free food (to go with the overpriced drinks), but when I got there at 5:30 the food table did not look too fresh, to say the least. So along with our overpriced drinks we ordered the cheese/olives/meat/grapes appetizer to share. I've had better and can't recall worse. It comes with 3 small pieces of bread - just in case you were thinking you might get a cracker. I'd recommend Switch's platter, but I would probably recommend a party tray from Albertson's over this. On the other hand, the place is beautiful, and in a great location. And the servers were very attentive. But for a Friday happy hour this place sure seemed quiet. Wonder why. (Note that some other reviews say that some menu items are good; it's a nice enough atmosphere that I wouldn't mind meeting up for a bite to try it out, but wouldn't go out of my way.)

Very disappointed in this location. It really deserves 2 stars, and looking at the other reviews, my experience was not an anomaly. Service was slow; they need more people working there; some employees were not friendly (though some were fine). I have been to other Dickey's locations and service was much better (friendlier, more professional, and faster.) My family and I got there at 6pm on a Sunday and waited a while in line, but we were lucky -- the line was to the door the entire time we were there, and moved very slowly. They were completely out of waffle fries, very low on the standard BBQ sauce, and out of the spicy. They ran out of ice cream, and after we finished we heard the employees telling customers they were out of macaroni and cheese. The location is small and tables are crammed together, and we had a hard time getting up to do anything (like get drinks). And since I eat chicken but not pork or beef, I'd appreciate if they didn't cut our chicken right on top of the mess from the other meats.  I will say that most of the food itself is fine; the chicken is tender; the BBQ sauce is good; the kids enjoyed some nuggets; we liked the stuffed baked potato. But the mac and cheese is awful; it's like cheese soup. And my son, who loves Caesar salad, took one bite of his and declared that he didn't like it; our youngest daughter (who also loves Caesar salad, and who hadn't heard our son express his distaste) took a bite and declared the same. I opted not to find out for myself.  Finally, it seems unfair that I could not couple the Groupon with the "kids eat free on Sunday" deal. We spent $12 on the Groupon, good for $24 only toward family packs; for that amount we would have gotten 2 adult meals and therefore 2 free kids' meals. And we still had to buy drinks. (Oh, and they were out of large cups.) So using the Groupon wasn't a good deal. We ended up separately buying the potato and a BBQ chicken sandwich (not a great deal at $5.50) to get the kids' meals free and took most of the family pack home. (Kids want nuggets; there's no way around that.)  There are other Dickey's locations that aren't too far. Or we'll go back to Joe's Real BBQ. (For the record, Tom's BBQ in Mesa is just ok; our favorite is Phil's in San Diego.)

I'm long overdue for a review for this place - my favorite bar in Arizona. As a craft beer fan (I try not to say "snob"...), I'm overwhelmed with a place with this good a selection of beers that I've never tried before or are worth trying again. In addition to the ones they brew themselves (which are quite good), they also have a terrific selection of locals and from elsewhere, on draft. I get sample sizes when  I have the time, a pint when I don't. Happy hour is $6 for a pitcher (roughly 2.5 pints) for local Arizona brews. I've been here for happy hours, dinners, and late drinks with friends and have had a quality experience every time. To their credit, for a craft beer place they have a decent selection of mixed drinks and some wines. For food, I've been pleased with chicken sandwiches (very tender), the Sunday all-you-can-eat bbq, and appetizers. The food is decent enough given that the focus is on the beer (in my opinion). Servers have been quite knowledgeable about the beers. Atmosphere is kick-back casual, with a bright interior with various types of places to sit - booths, bar, tables, patio. Patio is dog-friendly. Parking can be tight but I've parked across the (rather busy) street (i.e., across Indian School), and it's not that big a deal.  So far the only matches for beer selection are World of Beer (Tempe and Gilbert); Angel's Trumpet (which has no happy hour and the food is so-so at best); and 1702 (Tucson).

Unquestionably a 5-star experience for me and the friends and family who have visited. 5 stars for beer, food, environment, and service. It can't be denied that these guys know how to put together excellent, interesting beer. The taps vary based on what they've brewed.  I've never seen anything other than their own beers, as it should be here. Their IPA (which is great, by the way) is the only one that is always on tap. Which is why I don't order it - because I already know I like it, so I'd rather try their new creations (or ones that I missed before and are reappearing). From the lighter wheats and saisons to the gratzers, porters, stouts, and barrel-aged concoctions, I say try them all. Beer lovers paradise for sure. They now have a tasting room with even more taps, including some that aren't served in the restaurant side.   For food, they've taken the time to create a simple, quality menu. I've tried 3 different chicken sandwiches, duck fat fries, pretzels (with heavenly beer cheese) - all high quality. I can't recall anyone being unhappy with any of the food and have only heard compliments. Surprisingly good for a place that is so focused on the beer.   Service has always been good for us, and we've always been impressed with beer knowledge (especially the bartenders, obviously). Expect a long wait to during prime times, even with the extra space. Or go early.  Enjoy.
