Either I went to the wrong guy or something. All I asked for was a fade and to leave the top and he confirmed that he heard me and started to cut all the hair off the side. Not only that it was a horrible line up that I had to fix when I got home. The best part is when I told him to fix something he seem to get irritated. I had a better cut at super cuts. I still struggle to find a barber in Phoenix that knows how to cut black hair.

For black men's hair, this is not the place. Either I went to the wrong guy or something. All I asked for was a fade and to leave the top and he confirmed that he heard me and started to cut all the hair off the side. Not only that The best part is when is that he was more concerned with working the cash register than cutting my hair. I had a better cut at super cuts. I still struggle to find a barber in Phoenix that knows how to cut black hair.

This is probably the worst McDonald's I've ever been to in my life. 30 minute wait in the drive-through line orders are never right and the phone number on the receipt doesn't even work. This place either needs new management or just needs to be torn down and made into a Taco Bell or Jack-in-the-Box.

Good looking classic gym. I'm going to have to go back and try their classes out. The lady Whom I talked to  was very helpful, and price is pretty low. Like I said in the beginning this is a classic boxing gym so that you won't be a lot of big weights but you have cardio and plyo equipment, bags, and a full ring.
