The people (or person) who runs this company is not only rude on the phone (he attempted to make me feel bad for having a 9 to 5 job and not being avalialbe during those hours, when I specifically asked for a Saturday appointment), but after two full weeks of nobody calling me when they said they would, I called them and was told they would call me back.  They never called back that Saturday and finally called on Monday.  Because they are not prompt, are rude and because the guy calls you on a cell phone which always cuts out on you, I would never recommend this company to ANYONE.    In a customer service business, these guys have no understanding of what it takes to keep customers and I moved on to a different company without having them fix anything.  They will never get my money and I would not be shocked if they close down due to these problems. One star is far too kind.

Sun Devil Liquors is a really interesting place because the upstairs is a really large liquor store and the basement is a great lounge and beer/wine bar.  Wine Bar- They serve everything downstairs that they sell upstairs plus you can open any bottle of wine you buy or buy beer by the bottle from the fridges down there. They also recently installed 8 beer taps where they constantly switch out great craft beers (but be careful because some of them have high alcohol contents).  Price- The prices are good for any drinks purchased by the glass or bottle.  Any of the craft beers on tap might seem somewhat expensive but remember that most of them are pretty strong and are all really great beers. Normal prices for beer on tap are normally from $5 to $7 for a pint.  Lounge Area- In the basement next to the wine bar is a great lounge where they have art shows for local artists every few months. Great area to relax on the plush couches and to see some great art.   Art Shows- Every time they have a new art opening, they do great drink specials (which change each time) and sometimes will have bands play.  Make sure to stop by on these nights for some great drinks at good prices.  Come to Sun Devil and go downstairs to get some really good beer on tap plus great specials on wine pours and flights of craft beer. Also, get on their mailing list so you know when the new art shows are happening.

Food The best wings in town... Possibly the best I have ever tasted anywhere.  The reason these wings are so amazing is that you can and should get them GRILLED AND HOT OR SUICIDE, they are amazing because of the smokey grilled flavor but not because they are really spicy (which I normally love). Come for the real flavor of wings because you will not get it elsewhere.  The beer Great selection of cheep beers so choose what you like for a good price. Red hook is a good option.  Wait staff Ask for Jaime by name, she is fun and a very attentive and personable. She makes this place great even though it is surrounded by nothing in the middle of Mesa.

Food- The sushi is rather poorly rolled for my taste.  Many of the rolls are large in size which is normally good but in this case leads to the sushi falling apart when dipping in soy due to the poor technique in rolling them.    Price- It is not as cheap as it should be for the quality but it isn't terrible for sushi prices generally.  The food tastes ok but I find that the poor technique is too much for me to get past when eating sushi.  Fish quality is fine but not the best I have had in Phoenix.  Service- This is by far the worst thing about this restaurant.  NEVER SIT AT THE SUSHI BAR because you will have servers constantly reaching over your shoulders all night (during dinner service at least). The servers should have a place to get food for the tables without having to reach over customers.  This is a total failure of this restaurant design.  I get so angry at the bumping and shoving by the servers at the sushi bar that I will never go back.  Each time I go to give them another shot there aren't any tables and they sit me at the bar.    Go somewhere else to avoid the sub-par, expensive food and terrible service during busy hours.

The peppered steak pasty is amazing and the peppercorn brandy sauce is so addictive. Also the carne adovada pasty is great. They have too many pasties to choose from which is just another reason to keep coming back.  For dessert, get the banoffee pie but save room because it is huge ( big enough for two people or more).  Also, if you like beer they have a lot of it and you can get steins if quantity is your thing.

They said they would show up between 5:00 pm and 9:00 pm and instead showed up much much later than 9:00.  As one other review said, they are terrible at arriving on time.    DO NOT USE THEM EVEN THROUGH A HOME WARRANTY COMPANY.    They clearly do not care about you or your schedule.  What happened to companies that cared about their customers?

The Lamb kuzi was the probably the best lamb dish I have had at any restaurant ever.  The owner was great and very friendly.  We told him we were there for the first time and that we loved the food and he was so happy to hear the compliments that he gave us free baclavah.  Come support this great restaurant and its local owners!

Great new brewery in Tempe.  This place isn't much to look at (just lot's of concrete and a large number of TVs), but it does serve good beer at good prices and is a great place to watch sports.    Another thing is that since it just recently opened, it is somewhat of an unknown gem.  On multiple nights we have gone there and played apples to apples with the staff for a free beer.  It's nice to get away from the Tempe crowds sometimes and go to a place where they remember you.  As others have said in reviews, there is no actual menu but I like being able to order from other places.  I also love the free popcorn and pretzel mix every time I go in there.  Try all of their beers and they also have an 8 beer sampler which is a great way to do so.  Keep our new brewery thriving and get your friends in there for some drinks.

A great place to go for great food.    Location- It's a small space in a strip mall but that's not the draw of this great restaurant.    Food- Awesome, large burgers, Chicago style dogs (from an owner who is a Chicago native), Italian beef and a variety of sausages.  I had the double bacon burger tonight and it was a big portion of amazing, fresh veggies and good quality beef.  You know when you have a cheap burger where even the pickles are gross, well here the pickles are thick cut and great, the bacon is really tasty and everything else is perfect.    Note on food- They also have a burger challenge where you have to eat a 9 patty burger in 10 minutes to get your picture on the wall and a t-shirt.  I haven't tried this yet but want to soon.  Owner- The owner was working when we were there and he takes real pride in his food and his product.  He talked about how he fresh makes all of his fries to order because he never wants people to have soggy fries. He also gave us a big basket of fresh fries for free because he didn't want to throw them away and would not serve them to a later customer.   More reviews to come as I try more of their great food!

I like the original Vig a lot and the Vig Uptown is even better for Phoenix since the "outside" is actually inside but can be opened up during better weather.    Food- I really like all of the food here.  The vings are pretty good and are a great deal for happy hour.  Also the sliders on happy hour are a great deal.   Prices- This is my only gripe about the Vig.  Outside of happy hour their food is kind of pricey and their drinks really never get that cheap (even during happy hour).  However, it is all worth it for the bocce ball court and the quality of their drinks and food.  Just go during happy hour and you will be glad you did.  Order 2 or 3 of the happy hour food specials and a few drinks.  "Outdoor" Patio Area- Like I said, the fact that their patio can be indoor or outdoorish is great since it is way too hot to be outside for some parts of the year.  One problem with it being indoors is that the noise gets trapped inside and during happy hour or late-night it can get pretty loud in there.  Overall I like this place and will probably keep choosing it over the original Vig to stay in the A/C.  Basically everything else from the original Vig is exactly the same.
