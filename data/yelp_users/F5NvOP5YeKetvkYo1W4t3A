I forgot to review my birthday lunch......damn it anyways!   I wanted to try some of Mr. Biancos offerings but did not want to wait 3 hours for pizza so we decided to come here.  I figured it would be my only trip here in quite some time so I decided to get 2 sandwiches.  I got the tomato, basil and mozarella.  And I also got the sopresetta and provlone with roasted peppers.   The sopresetta was one of the top 5 sandwiches I have ever had.  It was absolutely perfect.  Not a whole lot of meat, but the flavor was super delicious!  The roasted red peppers and sharp provolone blended well and it was on some amazing bread.  Basically pizza crust.  SO GOOD!  The tomato sandwich was meh.  Im not the biggest fan of tomatos to begin with and when I tried I bite I knew why ;-).  I picked them out and basically ate a mozarella sandwich.  This one got a little soggy too.   About 8 bucks each which was ok by me.  The candy they give you in the bag is a super small caramel.  It was good, but nothing to rave about.  One bite and it was dust.  If I ever come back to Phoenix I will definitley stop by and get a sopresetta sandwich.  It was amazing!

I am bumping this up to 5 stars.  My buddy and I came here 2 days in a row for lunch.  I got the sopresetta sandwich each time and I found a new appreciation for it.  It is so darn simple, yet so damn tasty.  The mix of the slightly greasy/salty meat, combined with the flavor of the roasted red peppers and sharp....almost hard.....provolone cheese, stuffed in between that delicious bread they use=in my top 5 favorite sandwiches EVER!

We came back today to get the sopressata sandwich.  When we arrived, I took a look at the Market Sandwich of the day and it looked delicious so I got that instead.  Today the market sandwich was roasted pork belly, balsamic onions and some escarole.  It was freaking awesome.  The pork was juicy and fatty, the onions were on point and the escarole gave it some crunch, all the while on their amazing bread.  It was a great sandwich and I would definitely get it again.  My wife got the sopressata sandwich and this time it was a little different.  Usually it has roasted red peppers, but for whatever reason today it had some sauteed/grilled onions.  Still tasty might I add, but the combo of roasted red peppers was better in my opinion.  My wife being the awesome person she is, gave me almost half her sandwich.  It was awesome and overall it was a great lunch.  Washed it down with a Mexican Coke and a little nutty caramel for dessert.  Tasty stuff!

It's been a few years since I have been here.  Nothing has changed except for the price!  The Sopressata Sandwich is still one of the best sandwiches on the planet!  It's $10.00 nowadays but it's still worth it.  Fresh bread, decent amount of sopressata and aged provolone plus it has wonderful roasted red peppers on it too.  The flavor profile is fantastic.  Service is friendly and the taste is great!  I did notice one thing different...they used to give you a piece of candy with your sandwich.  Today they gave me like a bean salad looking thing...I didn't even try it ;-).  I would have preferred a piece of candy instead. They even have a restaurant/full service side restaurant now too.  I shall be back!

So......My boy B Davis wrote a review on this spot and said it was legit.  I have been in Phoenix for over a month now and have not eaten any GOOD Mexican food!  I was craving some tacos so I decided to try this spot out.  I was glad I drove down!  I walked in and was told to sit wherever I wanted.  I grabbed a table and a nice lady came over to take my drink order and deliver some chips and salsa.  I placed my order for 2 beef tacos and a cheese quesadilla with green chiles in it.  I had a large Diet Coke to drink.  Here is how the food was...............  Chips and Salsa-  They bring you out a large basket of chips and a little thing of salsa.  I took a bite of a chip and had a flashback.  They reminded me of something.....I took another bite and then it hit me.  These chips tasted exactly like the chips at El Tarasco in Manhattan Beach.  That is definitely a good thing.  El Tarasco serves up whole fried tortillas.  Juans cuts them into chips but the taste was identical.  I was impressed!  The salsa was tasty too.  It was pretty mild and refreshing.  The chips were so good that I ate 2 baskets full!  Beef Tacos-  I got 2 of these bad boys.  They are a bit small but they were awesome.  These also reminded me of somewhere from back home.......Titos Tacos!  Similar taste, texture and size.  Titos uses more cheese,  but other than that, they were pretty similar (Titos are a bit better but hey...Titos makes the best hard shell beef taco ever...no shame in never being as good as Titos).  The shredded beef was seasoned well, the shells were perfectly crispy. I would have liked a bit more cheese, but it was still enough the way they came out.  It was a fantastic beef taco!  Quesadilla with Chiles-  When I bit into this, it ALSO reminded me of somewhere from CA....... Sombreros!  I would always get a beef taco and quesadilla combo at Sombreros.  This quesadilla was an exact replica!  It had nicely melted cheese, tons of green chiles and it was folded up into a nice flour tortilla.  I dipped this in the salsa and it was a winner!  Diet Coke-  Nice to see they serve Coke products.  Total for my meal was $11.12.  Not too shabby for a grip of food.  I ate 3 different things and each one reminded me of some of my favorite Mexican food places from back in CA.  You simply cannot beat that!  Service was very friendly and it felt like you were eating in someones house kind of.  I can't wait to go back to try out some of their other offerings.  I can see this place becoming our families go to Mexican joint.  It's a bit of a drive from where I live (its way closer to work), but I was very impressed and will be back soon.   Good find B Davis.....good find!

We had a team builder event at work today and before we did our charity work, we came here for lunch.  I have to say, the staff was awesome!   There were 17 of us and everything went very smooth.  Our server was on top of everything from drink refills, to clearing plates, to serving everybody's food at the same time, etc.  Excellent, excellent service!  For food, me and my buddy Jon split an 18 inch thin crust pizza with sausage and olives.  The 18 inch pizza looks like a behemoth, but it is almost paper thin, so you can eat a lot of it.  It was delicious!  I had only been to Oregano's one time before, and I got a sausage and onion stuffed pie.  I remember their sausage being really delicious, and today confirmed it!  This pizza had huge chunks of sausage all throughout the pizza.  It was awesome!  Everybody else ordered a wide variety of foods from lasagna, to salads, to pasta dishes etc and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Portions are HUGE!  To finish the meal, we ordered a couple pizza cookies to pass around the table.  A salted caramel one and a chocolate chip cookie one.  If you have a sweet tooth, this is a perfect dessert.....a huge cookie topped with 3 scoops of ice cream!   I have to mention the excellent service once again!  Everyone in the restaurant worked as a team (getting refills, delivering food etc) and on the way out, every single person we walked by thanked us for coming in and wished us a good rest of our day.  I mean, EVERY. SINGLE. EMPLOYEE!  That is rare these days and it was nice to see.  I can't wait until they open the Oregano's out near my house in Surprise.  I know I will come here often.  The pizza is fantastic and the service has been 5 stars both the times I have been to an Oregano's.  Good stuff!

Ever since my buddy took me to a cigar lounge in San Diego, I have been hooked.  I can't remember a more relaxing time out.  I have since scoped out some spots here in Phoenix, and Churchill's has been fantastic!   This spot is super chill!  They have a large humidor with an almost infinite selection of cigars.  They have a couple of TVs (One huge one near the front of the shop), a fully stocked bar etc.  Customer service has been amazing the 2 times I stopped in here.  Great ventilation and incredibly comfy chairs will keep me coming back.    Prices may be a tad more expensive for certain cigars, but overall, I will pay a little bit more to be able to sit back and relax at this joint.  Can't wait until my buddy comes out to Phoenix to take him here!  I have been incredibly impressed and will continue to come back whenever a cigar craving comes about!

Looks like E Thomas Blvd is the spot for good Mexican food!  2 for 2 so far!  After my meal last night, the Mexican food bug was implanted in my body and soul.  I needed more, pronto!  I drove down here because of the good reviews on Yelp.  I was happy I took the drive.  They start you out with some chips and salsa.  I then ordered the "Don Jose Special" which consists of a beef tamale, cheese enchilada, bean tostada, beef taco, rice or beans and corn or flour tortillas.  This special came with a drink too.  Total was $11.00.  Here is how everything was..............  Chips and salsa-  This was the only thing that I was not truly impressed with.  The chips were nice and thin but they weren't even warm and they weren't salted either.  The salsa that they serve is more of a puree.  No chunks in it.  They both tasted just ok. I've had much better elsewhere although I can think of some places that are worse too.  Beef Tamale-  This was a large tamale stuffed with shredded beef/machaca.  It was covered in red sauce and was pretty hefty in size.  It was a little dry, but the beef was flavored well and the sauce tasted pretty good.  Cheese Enchilada-  I am usually not the biggest fan of enchiladas but this one was great!  Plain and to the point.  Lots of cheese, and lots of onions which I love.  This thing was also covered in their red sauce.  It was really good!  Bean Tostada-  Simple and to the point.  Beans, lettuce, cheese on top of a fried tortilla shell.  I like how it held up and was still crispy/crunchy even though I ate it awhile after it came to the table.  It was a good tostada!  Beef Taco-  A little bit small but packed with flavor.  It reminded me of a Lolitas beef taco, just smaller in size.  The beef was seasoned well and they topped this with a lot of cheese.  I was pretty impressed!  Diet Coke- Coke products which is awesome.  The only bad thing about the drink was the size of the cup it was served in.  Couldn't have been more than 8 ounces.  It was like a tiny orange juice glass.  Free refills at least.  Service was friendly and to the point.  Their a la carte prices on things seemed a bit high so I won't be rushing back to try out other things.  If in the area again, and craving Mexican food, there will be no hesitation to come back though.  Everything was pretty darn tasty and the combo plate was priced well for the sheer amount of food you receive.    Cash only!

This was on my Bookmark list and was also pretty close to work.  I was browsing their website and one of my coworkers saw my computer screen.  He gave me the thumbs up and told me that Spinatos was his favorite.  I decided to try it out.  I called in my order for an 11 inch Mama Spinatos Signature Spinach Pizza.  Drove down and picked it up.  Here is how it was.......  Spinach Pizza-  I parked my car in a random lot and decided to dig in.  The pizza is Chicago style thin crust.  They cut it into small triangles and squares.  It looked amazing.  It was topped with cheese, spinach, tomatoes and garlic.  The ingredients were fresh as can be plus they were plentiful.   The taste was great!  The sauce was a little sweet, the cheese was melted nice, the spinach and tomatoes were awesome plus it had a nice garlic punch too.  The crust was just alright though.  It was a little too soft for my liking.  Maybe because it was for pickup?  Maybe it had too many toppings?  It wasn't horrible but if it was more crispy, it would have been way better than it already was.  Service was extremely friendly on the phone and during pickup.  Bonus points for having fantastic napkins!  They are basically 2×2 squares of thick paper towel like napkins.  Possibly the best napkins I have ever been issued for a takeout spot lol.  I will be back to try out some other pizzas in the near future...probably dine in to see if the crust is crisper.  Overall, I was impressed though.  It was a very good pizza!

It was our 5th Anniversary and we were all set to go to Grimaldis in Peoria.  We got there and found out that there was an hour and a half wait.  Forget that!  I talked my wife into coming down here to Spinatos.  I had gotten a pizza from here a week or so ago and it was pretty delicious.  We drove down here and decided to eat here.  We walked in and were seated outside on the patio right away.  We went with a Greek Salad and a medium pizza with pepperoni and garlic.  Pepsi products to drink.  Here is how the food tasted...................  Greek Salad-  We got the "entree" sized salad and it was plenty for the two of us.  This thing was packed with lettuce, feta, tons of split olives, pepperocinis, onions etc.  We each had about 2 plate fulls worth.  Their dressing is delicious.  Creamy but not layered on heavy.  It was a great salad.  Pepperoni and Garlic Pizza-  My last pizza from here was for pickup.  It was a bit soggy when I got it.  When you eat in, it turned out to be much better.  Still a tiny bit greasy, but still delicious.  Our pizza was cooked proper with a little brown on the cheese.  Their sauce is fantastic and the pepperoni and garlic was a great combo.  Their sauce is a tad sweet but not too much so.  A medium pizza is perfect for two people.  Its a great Chicago thin crust.  I definitely want to try out some of their other offerings.   The reason I am giving this 5 stars though is because of the service!  The hostess was great, our waitress was on point and when we were leaving, everyone wished us a great evening and thanked us for our business.  Speaking of that..........while we were waiting for our check, an older gentleman came walking around asking tables how everything was.  It turns out that it was the OG himself...Ken Spinato!   The guy who started this place back in the 70s.  We chatted for awhile and got into a good conversation about our move from San Diego and how we were going to go to Grimaldis but came here instead.  He was impressed that we had driven from Surprise to come here.  We had a great conversation about pizza, their sauce, Phoenix in general etc.  It was a great way to end the night.  I'll be honest...Grimaldis is still my favorite pizza in the Phoenix area, but Spinatos is definitely creeping up the ladder.  Definitely the best Chicago style thin crust I have ever had, plus the service and overall friendliness of ALL the employees I have encountered will keep me and the family coming back!  I can definitely see why they are a Phoenix institution and why people love them so much.  It was a great 5th anniversary and I'm glad we spent it eating dinner here at Spinatos!

Finally got my hands on this pizza.........a little back story, first!  About 5 months ago, I was sitting at work, about to go to lunch, and a pizza craving hit (pizza cravings hit me ALL THE DAMN TIME...but I need to have some self restraint or I would be eating pizza every day and weigh 500lbs.)!  I had been to most of the "good" pizza joints near work and I kind of wanted to try something new.  Enter Red Devil.  I looked up their website online, picked up the phone and placed an order for a small cheese pizza.  The guy told me it would be about 25 minutes.  That was perfect timing since Red Devil is about a 20-25 minute drive from work.  I get down there, park, go up to the take out window and give them my number.  The guy looks at me and says, "You never ordered a pizza...we don't have that number in our system, plus, I was the one taking orders for the last hour and we don't have your pizza".  I know for damn sure I ordered it, had my number, drove all the way down here and was not hallucinating on ordering a pizza!  I show the guy my phone with Red Devils number on it and my minute long conversation.  He goes, "Um...yeah...that's the Red Devil down on McDowell".  My dumb ass ordered it at the wrong location.  I felt like such an idiot!  The dude was like, "No worries man, I can whip you up a pizza in about 15 minutes".  I passed because it would have been pushing the limits of my lunch break and I sadly walked away with my tail between my legs and with no damn pizza!  Bummer!   Fast forward to today.........  I called the correct number this time, and placed my order for a small cheese pizza with fresh garlic.  The guy said it would be ready in about 25 minutes so I drove down Bell to capture my pizza.  I walked up to the window, gave the guy my order number and he handed over my pie.  A small (10 inch...that's what she said!) pizza with garlic came out to $8.64.  I gave him $10.00 and told him to keep the change.  I took this pizza out to my car and dug in.  Here is how it was...............  Small 10" pizza-  I opened the box and was impressed with what I saw.  It was cut into 6 small slices and it smelled great.  It had a ton of melted mozzarella as well as globs of minced garlic everywhere!  The crust had a nice little char/brown to it and you could tell it just came fresh out of the oven.  I picked up a slice and took a bite.  HOT AS A MOFO!  I should have let this thing cool down a bit.  The flavors were so good though, I didn't give a shit and motored through that first piece burning the roof of my mouth as I went.  Good cheese (a tad greasy), great tasting sauce and a ton of garlic did this pizza right!  The best part of this pizza was the crust!  It's a medium/thin dough..more on the thinner side but with a little "body" to it.  Right when I bit in, I knew it was great!  It had a slight crispy crunch on the bottom and then enough of a doughy chew to compliment it.  I studied the crust and noticed a whole bunch of little air bubbles in the dough.  I LOVE dough like that!  It's almost like eating fresh baked bread out of the oven.  It was mighty fine pizza dough and crust!  I mowed down my 6 slices in a matter of minutes and was sad when I was chewing my last piece of that amazing crust!  I would put this crust up there with La Grande Orange as being my favorite in Phoenix (strictly on crust rating/preference).  Both places have the same type of texture, and both places are absolutely fantastic!  Overall, I thought it was pretty damn good.  Red Devils have been around since the 60's and I can definitely see why.  I would not hesitate to come back for another pizza (Their Mediterranean pizza sounds awesome) and can hopefully make it through some of their other menu items, too.  Add this to the list of another great pizza joint in Phoenix!  It was great and with a few more visits, I can definitely see this becoming a 5 star joint!

Totally forgot to write a review of this place............  I went here 2 days in a row a few months back to kill some time before heading downtown to go to a baseball game.  First time there, I purchased a game card and loaded it with $20.00.  I played mostly claw games and didn't win shit!  Rigged!  I spent about half my card on claw games and the other half upstairs on pinball.  Speaking of upstairs, they have a ton of pinball machines as well as a pretty decent selection of old school arcade games like Pac Man, Galaga, Centipede, Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter etc.  They have all of their newer games downstairs including Time Crisis and a whole bunch of car/driving games.    My first day there, when I was about to leave, I saw a sign on the door.  Weekdays, $10.00 all you can play for 3 hours.  I came back the next day and went with that.  You pay your money at the snack bar/counter and they load your card for unlimited play.  It did not include claw games or prize/ticket games, but it was good for any other arcade game.  Some of those fancy driving games are like $1.50 a turn, so the $10.00 card more than pays for itself after only a handful of games.  I would highly recommend that option if you are in Phoenix and like playing video games.  The place was deserted during the week until the kids got out of school and started showing up.  If you come around 1pm or so, you can have that 3 hours from 1-4pm pretty much uninterrupted and have most of the arcade to yourself to play whatever games you choose.  It's a really great value for 3 hours of entertainment!    Overall, I had fun both days I went.  The place is a bit older and not in tip top shape, but it was fairly clean and the workers I did interact with, were pretty friendly.  Oh yeah...they have rides and mini golf too.  I'm sure I will be back sometime in the future to explore those options and to play some more video games!

Well, I think I found my Mexican grilled chicken spot in AZ................  I had this place bookmarked and decided to come down today. This style of chicken is my favorite and I am always on the lookout for places that cook it this way over charcoal.  I looked at some of the Yelp pictures and noticed that they had/have a promotion for Wednesdays (Buy one whole chicken, get half a chicken gratis).  I drove on down to check it out.  I walked inside, placed my order for the Wednesday special and a few minutes later, I was handed a heavy bag and was on my way.  Here is how it was.......  Chicken-  Wow!  Fantastic chicken!  Reminded me of some of my SD joints.  I opened the container and there was a massive mound of chicken!  3 breasts, 3 wings (one was like a half wing), 3 thighs and 3 legs.  This pile of chicken smelled fantastic.  I bit into a wing first and was instantly comforted by the charcoal, smoky taste of the grilled chicken.  It was fantastic!  This was after a 30 minute ride in the car, too.  Still hot, still moist, and still delicious!  The legs were really large, the breasts were nice and big and even the thighs were tasty (I usually don't like or eat the thighs)!  I scarfed down almost a whole chicken and saved a few of the breasts for lunch tomorrow!  Sides-  I'm doing low carb so I didn't really dive into these.  I did sample half a tortilla, a bite of rice and some of the salsa.  All 3 were delicious.  I tossed the beans (pinto beans, kind of watery) and saved the rice for my son and the salsa for later on tonight.  They also pack in 2 grilled jalapenos which were hot and spicy and a "side salad" which was a few pieces of lettuce and a tomato...random lol!  The lady running the joint was very friendly and smiling the whole time.  This whole thing only cost $14.90!  Yup....on Wednesdays, less than $15 bucks gets you 12 pieces of chicken, rice, beans, tortillas and salsa.  One hell of a deal!  I am sad that starting next week, I will not have Wednesdays off any more.  If you ARE off on Wednesdays, and enjoy this type of chicken, it is well worth the drive down here!  I will be back soon enough!

I hadn't had my new addiction in over 8 hours and was having major withdrawals. I had to get some gelato...and I needed it now!   After we left Grimaldis, I looked this place up and decided to swing by.  There were a few people in there which was good because it gave me time to scope out what I wanted.  I decided to go with a medium, half chocolate, half peanut M&M.  They sure do give you a lot of gelato.  It was only $5 bucks and they give you a packed 8 ounce cup.  I paid my money and took my gelato outside to eat by my car.  The chocolate was really good and the peanut M&M tasted exactly like a chewed up peanut M&M.  It was a great blend of flavors.  The only thing that was a tad off, was the texture of it. After every bite, I had a "filmy" taste/feel in my mouth.  Hard to describe but I know for sure I didn't have that type of sensation at the other place I ate at earlier today.  The odd after bite texture keeps this from being perfect.  Its still a good spot for some tasty gelato and I would definitely come back if I lived in AZ.

We took a little vacation over to AZ and this was home base.  We got a killer deal on Expedia and it was a nice stay.  We were greeted by a friendly lady named Amber who checked us in and told us about all the amenities that comes with our stay.  Free dinner and cocktails between 5-7 M-F.  We didn't partake unfortunately but that sure is a nice thing to offer.  They also offer free breakfast which we did use every single day if not just for coffee and juice.  The food wasn't the best nor did they have the widest selection, but it was free so you cant complain.  The rooms were nice and spacious.  They had a fridge, dishes etc.  This would be an awesome place for an extended stay.  They had a separate bedroom with a large bath.  The shower was kind of narrow and sloped weird but the rest of the bathroom was nice.  The bed was comfy and they provide you with a shitload of pillows which I love.  The only bad part about the room was the furniture.  The couch wasn't comfy at all, and they had this little old school recliner which wasn't too comfy either.  Dont know what kind of cable they have but it only had about 15-20 channels which was weak.  The pool area was nice and we swam pretty much every single night.  Only once was someone else out there.  The pool is small, but its perfect because nobody was in it and they always had a stash of clean towels.  This hotel is located about 5 miles up Scottsdale Blvd from all the hipster hangouts/bars in downtown Scottsdale.  Free parking too.  And free internet.  Overall it was an awesome stay and I would definitely come back again next time we venture over to AZ.

Had an awesome time here at breakfast.  Its an old school diner.  Juke boxes at the table and everything!  We got the breakfast special which was 3 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon and hash browns.  It was only $3.99!  I got a heath bar shake and my buddy got coffee.  The heath bar shake was awesome!  They hook it up too by that they give you the shake, plus the leftovers in the metal shake container.  So its like 2 shakes in one.  It was kind of hard to suck through the straw because they put sooooooo much heath bar in there but I wasn't complaining......I love heath bars!    The service was awesome and our waiter was really nice!  Cool vibe, good food and low prices make this one of the best diners I have ever been in!

Some of the fellas (and one lady) from work tapped me on the shoulder and said that they were headed here for lunch.  I drove over there to meet them and to try out some pizza.  They have a great deal M-F for lunch.... 2 slices cheese and a drink for only $4.10!   Can't beat that!  The pizza was good...crisped up in the oven nice.  The cheese looked a tad greasy but it was not...no puddles to be found anywhere.  The sauce was just alright but the crust made up for it.  Really good crust! The slices were really big too!  Score!   Service was to the point, not friendly, not rude but you could tell that they were appreciative for your business.  It's only a mile or so from work so I'm sure I will be back for that killer lunch special.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food too!

While searching for an ATM machine on Saturday night, we saw this place off in the distance.  Drove by it and it looked pretty cool so we decided we would come to it in the morning before we headed out of town.  I rarely see stand alone bagel shops anymore so we really wanted to try it.  Walked in around 10 and the place was happening!  Tons of people were eating their food there and a few were getting things to go.  They had a wide variety of bagels and they also had bialys.  I had heard the word "bialy" before but had no idea of what they were so I asked the super helpful lady at the counter.  She explained that they are like a bagel, less tasty, but more healthy.  She explained they are baked and made without sugar.  I decided to try a plain one of those and got 2 everything bagels too.  My wife got an onion bagel and a rye bagel both with cream cheese.  Total for everything was a little over $10.00.  Not bad for 5 bagels, 2 of them with cream cheese.  These things were HUGE!   Bonus points too.......the lady packed Ziploc freezer bags and twist ties in our bag to go just in case we weren't going to eat them right away.   That was some good looking out!  So how did they taste?......  Bialy-  Not bad but the lady was right.  It was kind of like eating a hard dinner roll almost.  It was decent but I don't know if I would get one again.  I would maybe get a flavored one instead of plain.  Next trip to Scottsdale I will let you guys know ;-)  Everything Bagel-  I had these when we got home for dinner.  They were awesome!  These things were massive yet they tasted great.  Sometimes you get a large bagel and its dried out and airy....not these things!  I had one with just butter and one with peanut butter and jelly.  They were really great and super filling.   I had a few bites of my wifes onion bagel too.  The onion bagel with cream cheese was really good.  Little tip here though that can save you a buck or two for you thrifty bastards ;-).  If you are buying 2 bagels and want cream cheese, only get one with cream cheese.  They slather these up with so much, you can scrape the excess off and use it on your other one.  You can then use that extra buck or two to tip the nice ladies that work here.  I would definitely come back here again when we go back to Scottsdale.  The girl taking care of us was super nice and helpful, the bagels were great and the price was decent.  Overall, a good shop to have around if you live in Scottsdale!

All I have to say is this............ $8.00 for all you can bowl from 11am-5pm during the week.  And that includes shoe rental!  Yes, and I repeat........$8.00 for all you can bowl including shoe rental!  We had a blast!  We had the bowling alley to ourselves for the first 10 minutes or so.  My wife kicked my ass in 3/5 games.  It was fun times.  The workers there were extremely friendly and helpful too.  Can't get much better than this place!

Best hot dogs ever?  Almost....damn near a photo finish but Wieners Circle in Chicago has my #1 vote, but you know what?  Coming in second is still something to be proud of.  Teds Hot Dogs are a-m-a-z-i-n-g!  We came here 2 times during our 4 days in the desert.  Both times I left with a smile on my face and a stomach full of tube steaks.  The first day we went I got 2 regular dogs, a white hot sausage, split an order of onion rings and washed it down with a Loganberry shake.  We got in line and the man grilling the dogs kindly asks you what you would like.  You kind of shout it out and then he grabs the dogs and stacks them in order of when they are going to be cooked.  A very streamlined operation.  By the time you reach the man, they are pretty much done and then handed off to the condiment lady.  You tell them what you want on each dog.  I went with mustard, onions and their hot sauce concoction. They dish up your onion rings and make your shakes and then off you go.  These dogs are super tasty.  Everything just works so well.  They use a soft potato bun and the dogs are char-grilled over charcoal so they get a crispy/burnt like texture to them.  I devoured those things in a matter of minutes.  The onion rings are more like an onion loaf.  Pretty good.  The Loganberry shake was very good too.  Just sweet enough without overpowering it.  The shakes are a tad small though but they are the right consistency and you can easily drink it through your straw which was nice.  2nd trip I got a foot-long, a regular and an Italian sausage.  This time we split fries and got another Loganberry shake.  The Italian sausage was the winner of both trips.  It was the BEST sausage I have ever had.  I got it topped with just mustard and onions.  It was perfectly cooked, snap when you bit in, but soft and almost mushy when you chewed through it.  Kind of hard to describe but god damn that was a tasty sausage.  Perfect flavors and everything.  My 2 dogs I got topped like day 1.  Mustard, onions and hot sauce.  The wife had a burger which she said was ok.  Looked kind of skimp though.  She doesn't eat dogs so she missed out.    I will have dreams about this place.  It was by far my favorite 2 meals in AZ and I would eat here all the time if I lived close.   I cant wait to find some reason to go back to AZ just to eat here.  It may even be worth the 5 hour drive just to eat these, turn around and come back.  Seriously.....these dogs are great!

The meal I was looking forward to the most this trip was Teds.  Once again Teds proved that it is the best!  This was our meal on the way out of the desert.  6 hours later I'm still drooling just thinking about how great it was!  I went with a quad of encased meats.  I got an Italian Sausage, a Bratwurst, a White Hot, and a jumbo All Beef Hot Dog.  Yes that is a lot of dogs...and yes they were all devoured in record time.  I got a loganberry shake and my wife got some fries and a chocolate shake.  Total damage was like $23.00 or so.  In order of greatness.  1.  Italian Sausage-  These things are great.  Still the best Italian Sausage I have ever had.  Got this one topped with mustard and onions.  Delicious, spicy, flavorful etc.  It was a great sausage. 2.  Bratwurst-  Topped with mustard and onion.  Similar texture to the Italian but more smoky and less spicy.  A fantastic sausage. 3.  White Hot-  Its a mix of veal, pork and beef.  Its a plump sausage with a white color.  I got that topped with mustard and onions also.  This one didn't have as much flavor as the other 2 but it was still excellent. 4.  Jumbo Beef Dog-  This one I got topped with mustard, onions, relish and their hot sauce.  It was a huge plump all beef dog.  It was bigger and thicker than any of the sausages.  It was great as well but I would have preferred another Italian or Brat instead of this thing....and that's saying something.....ALL of their hot dogs/sausages here are great....some are just greater than others.  Fries-  Real crispy shoestring fries.  They were perfect.   Shakes-  Loganberry.  Delicious!  Not too sweet and a perfect consistency to suck through the straw.  A tad small, but it was only like $2.00 so that's understandable.   People in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale sure are lucky.  This is the only Teds outside of upstate NY.  There should be more of these.  They are some great hot dogs and are some of the best I have ever had.  I will continue to come to AZ just for these things.  These hot dogs/sausages are THAT GOOD!

Still my favorite hot dogs.  We started the trip and ended the trip with meals at Teds.  First visit-  Got there about 2pm on Saturday afternoon.  I have never seen a line of more than 5-7 people here at Teds.  We walked in and there was a line about 30 people deep.  I don't know if everyone was getting their hot dog fix since they were closed on Easter or what,  but it was busy!  Waited in line and placed my order for a Footlong, Polish, White Hot and a Corn Dog. (This trip, I was going to eat every hot dog they had....veggie and kids hot dogs don't count ;-) lol)  Washed it down with a loganberry shake.  My wife got some fries.    Second visit-  Got there around 10:30am and there were only 2 people in front of us.  Today I placed my order for a Bratwurst, Italian, All Beef and Regular Dog.  My wife got a hamburger and some onion rings.  Washed it down with another loganberry shake.  To add to my previous review, in my opinion, this is the order of greatness of Teds dogs/sausages.  1. Italian- My favorite.  Spiced right and always delicious. A must order every time! 2. Bratwurst- Close runner up to the Italian.  A must order every time! 3. Polish- Another great sausage.  4. Regular Dog- The classic. 5. All Beef Dog- Huge and beefy. 6. White Hot- Wont get it again probably.  Not enough flavor. 7. Corn Dog- Foster Farms regular corn dog.  Fried proper but plain.  I can make one like that myself at home. 8. Foot Long- Tastes different than the other dogs.  Bun was stale, have not liked it the 2 times I ordered it.  Wont ever get it again.  Cant wait to go back.  The dogs are always delicious!

Another update...nothing has changed.  Started and ended my two day journey at Ted's.  First trip I got an Italian, a Bratwurst and an all beef dog.  Topped the sausages with mustard and onions and the all beef dog with mustard, onion, relish and hot sauce.  Washed it down with a Diet Coke.   While I was eating, I overheard a conversation a few tables over.  This lady and man asked this group how they liked the food etc.  Turns out, the people asking the questions were one of Teds Grandaughters and the CEO of Teds.  Pretty cool stuff!  Second trip, I got the United Nations of Sausages........ Italian (Italy), Bratwurst (Germany), and a Polish (Poland).  I got all 3 topped with mustard, onion and hot sauce.  I had an online coupon for free fries too.  Washed it down with a Diet Coke.    I can't say enough about Ted's Hot Dogs.  They are without a doubt my favorite food in AZ and I will continue to come here.  Once I move out here in a few weeks, its going to take some major willpower to keep me away from this place.  They are simply the best!

Pretty solid theater.  A little hard to find though because its all the way in the back of the plaza.  Its one of only 2 theaters in the area that accepts Fandango so we had to come here pretty much.  Saw The Lincoln Lawyer.  Good flick.  Seats were comfy, staff was friendly, concession prices were fair.  The clincher though was the popcorn.  It was delicious.  I got a small and it was only $5.25.  I made it through the whole thing without one bad piece.  Not one kernel in sight!  Thats like finding a 4 leaf clover haha!  I was very impressed!

Went here last night for a coworkers going away shindig.  The place was cool.  We had a large table outside on the patio and our waitress was on top of everything.  Blue Moons were $4.00 during Happy Hour and they had food deals too.  The people next to me got fish and chips and coconut fried shrimp (you order them individually...$1.29 each...they were big) and seemed to enjoy them.  This place has a grip of TVs but most of them are live link horse racing tracks.  Padres is an off site betting place with kiosks where you can wager on horse racing.  Interesting mix of folks...old timers with their racing programs to younger 20 somethings hanging out.  It was a chill spot and I could see myself coming back for a beer after work with the gang.

My son had received some Toys R Us gift cards for his birthday and we decided to use them today.  The store is decently large and they have a wide variety of anything you are looking for.  The workers here were AWESOME!  Every single one we encountered was extremely friendly and wanted to help us find whatever we needed.  One of the ladies found out that it was my sons 1st birthday so she went and got him a balloon and a paper crown for his birthday.  It was a really nice gesture and my kid liked the balloon a lot....not so much for the paper crown lol.  We got our son a new build and play block type toy that he will hopefully love.  Prices were fair...might be able to find lower prices online, but for quantity and variety, this place is great!  We may make it a birthday tradition to take our son here and have him pick out a new toy!

My nacho craving was back so I decided to drive down here to get some!  I read an article online stating that the nachos at The Old Pueblo Cafe were some of the best in the West Valley.  I had to check them out and confirm that myself!  I drove down, walked inside and was told to sit wherever I wanted.  I grabbed a table outside (the outside patio area is huge btw) and was brought some chips and 2 kinds of salsa.  The chips were pretty good...thin, crispy, salted fine.  The 2 salsas were a pico de gallo and one that was in a squirt bottle...more like a hot sauce than a salsa.  They both tasted fine.  The pico was actually really good and refreshing.  I ordered a water to drink and placed my order for the Old Pueblo Nachos with shredded beef.   Here is how they were.................  Old Pueblo Nachos ($9.95)-  These things came on a massive hot plate!  These nachos had a ton of crispy and sturdy chips, pinto/refried beans, melted cheese, shredded beef, sour cream, guacamole and a little lettuce and tomatoes.  Could have done without the lettuce but I think it was just for presentation purposes anyways.  The nachos were great!  The shredded beef had a bunch of green chilis in it.  It was delicious!  The cheese was melted perfectly, the beans were hearty, and the chips were warm and crispy.  A tad bit skimp on the sour cream and guacamole but most places are like that anyways so I can't complain.  I did my best and devoured about 75% of them and was stuffed to the brim.  Definitely a delicious and plentiful order of nachos!  Service was friendly.  The waiter was very quiet and mellow and so was the lady who brought out my food.  They were both nice though and checked on me throughout my meal.  I don't know when I will be back just because it is a little bit of a drive from where I live (20 minutes or so) but the chips, nachos and service were definitely worth a return visit.

I was pleasantly surprised!  This zoo is only about 10 minutes down the road from our house.  We had always talked about going, but never made it down there until today.  This morning, we woke up, decided today was the day, and drove down.  Tons of free parking out front!   We had a coupon for a buy one get one free.  Adults are $34.00, kids under 3 are free.  So all 3 of us got in for the $34.00.  Not bad!  They have season passes which are $100.00 per adult (my wife is probably going to buy one).  This zoo is HUGE!  Way bigger than I had ever imagined.  The best part about it?  Flat ground.  You won't be climbing any hills at all.  All of the paths are dirt though, so it does get a little bit dusty, but it's all flat.  My wife wasn't feeling so well today and she was appreciative of how many places they have to sit...benches every couple of exhibits.  We made our way around the zoo in about 2.5 hours but could have spent much more time there.  As far as the animals, this place has pretty much everything except for elephants (at least we didn't see any).  Tons and tons of different varieties of monkeys and birds.  They have giraffes, zebras, lions, leopards, cheetahs, kangaroos etc.  A HUGE variety of animals and all of them were out and about and active.  You could get pretty up close and personal with the exhibits too.  We fed the giraffes for .50 cents.  Yup!   You can feed a giraffe for 2 quarters.  You get about a handful of feed, walk up to the railing, lean over and pretty much have the giraffe take the feed from your hand.  Their tongues feel really weird and are freakishly long!  Where else can you feed a giraffe for .50 cents?  Nowhere!    They also have a pretty large aquarium portion, too.  Sharks, alligators, snapping turtles, penguins, etc.  You can feed sting rays etc.  This place has it all!  The only negative thing about today,  and it was not the zoos fault.....there were a grip of school kids and field trips today.  Kids today drive me nuts!  I saw 10 year old kids taunting animals, running amuck, no manners, cutting in front of other people etc.  Just a bunch of shitheads.  Anyways....if you went on a day without school groups, it would be even more enjoyable than it already was.   If you live anywhere in/near Phoenix, this zoo is definitely worth the trip out here!  Oh yeah, they have a Dillon's BBQ restaurant attached to the zoo.  The smell of BBQ was making me hungry.  I'm definitely coming back to try that out!  Cant wait!

Damn..this Albertsons is pretty whack!  I lived within 1000 feet of an Albertsons when I lived in Santee, CA.  That was the only grocery store I would go to.  Workers were friendly, prices were always good plus it was close to my house so it was convenient.   This Albertsons is like night and day compared to that one.  The whole store feels creepy, there is never anyone in there, the cashiers/baggers aren't that friendly and the clientele that shops there are weird.  I have noticed that the prices are not that great either.  With Fry's, Walmart, Safeway and soon to be Winco opening across the street, I don't know why anyone would choose to come here and I don't know how they are still in business.  WTF is up, AZ Albertsons?  Take a page from your CA neighbors and maybe I will be back.

Why the hell do I keep coming back to Red Lobsters?    My wife loves their chicken alfredo cajun pasta dish and she was craving it tonight.  We drove down and decided to check out the Surprise Red Lobster. We arrived around 4:15 and we were seated pretty quick.  That was one of the few good things I can say about this place.    Once we were seated, it took awhile for anyone to come over to greet us.  Our waitress stopped by about 5 minute later with a serving of their biscuits.  She did apologize for the delay and let us know that she would be back with us shortly.  Another 5 minutes pass and a different server comes over to get our drink orders.  A few minutes after that, a totally different dude drops off our waters but doesn't have my wifes iced tea.  Our original server eventually bought it over, but it still took like 15 minutes in the place before we had drinks in front of us.  Lame!  We had our son with us too and he started to get cranky.  It's damn near impossible to entertain an 18 month old if they are tired, cranky and hungry.  All this while, I could see servers, bus boys etc just chilling over by the drink station.  If you are going to work as a team, work as a damn team!  Don't have the waitress busting her ass with multiple tables while you guys chill and crack jokes in plain sight of everyone.  Anyways...........  We placed our orders right away and tried to keep our son busy.  Food came out in a decent amount of time (at least compared to the drinks) but it was still longer than usual.  I ordered their garlic butter mussels and my wife went with her usual of the chicken alfredo cajun pasta.  The food was alright.  We scarfed it down and took a lot of it to go because of our son getting cranky.    Doubt I would come back just because of the really slow service.  It wasn't even busy in there and service still lagged big time.  I couldn't imagine a Fri/Sat night after 6pm. Their prices have steadily gone up over the last few years, too.  Our bill was almost $40 bucks after tip for one meal, one appetizer and an iced tea.  Not worth it!

Stopped here for breakfast the other day.  I love their biscuits!  I got a chicken biscuit and a 4 piece Chick Fil A chicken minis.  Total was just a bit over 5 bucks.  Here is how they were..........  Chicken Biscuit- Delicious!  My favorite thing from this restaurant.  I prefer it over their chicken sandwiches and everything else.  The biscuit is soft, buttery and delicious.  The chicken is always prepared perfectly.  I should have gotten 2 of these.  You will see why, next.  Chick Fil A Minis-  Eh...they were just alright.  A bit skimp for the price.  The "buns" they use for these things are like cinnamon rolls without the heavy icing.  They are kind of hard to describe.  I didn't really enjoy them though.  They had an almost "stale" taste/texture to them.  The chicken pieces were super skimp too.  I almost guarantee that those 4 mini pieces of chicken didn't add up to/equal what is in their biscuits.  I would not get these again.  Service is always friendly.  They are sincere and treat everyone well.  This place is pretty close to my house so I'm sure I will be back.

We decided to come check out Black Mass today.  $7.50 for matinee pricing (not bad, I guess?).  We got an XL popcorn for $7.75 (one free refill if you wanted..we didn't) which was pretty darn tasty.  The guy at the counter layered the butter flavored topping for us and got us 2 cups of water really quick....nice dude.  Seats were comfy (reclined) and the theater was clean and well maintained.  I would not hesitate to come back.

So.......we wanted to go out to lunch, but we didn't want to spend a lot of money.  Remembered that we had received some gift cards from the in laws for the Cheesecake Factory.  Problem solved!  I had not yet been to this Cheesecake Factory since moving out to AZ.  We would go to the one in Mission Valley occasionally and the food/service was usually pretty good.  We came down here to this one today for a late lunch.  We arrived at around 3:00 and there weren't too many people there.  We got a seat immediately at a table and the waitress brought over the high chair.  We placed our order for drinks (waters, and my wife got an iced tea), got some bread delivered (sourdough and a honey oat type brown bread) and placed our order.  I had been scoping out the Yelp reviews and pictures online prior to arrival, and I saw a few pictures of fish tacos.  I had yet to have fish tacos since I moved to AZ, and they looked legit, and sounded legit, so I went with those.  My wife got a lunch sized portion of the pasta carbonara with chicken.  About 15 minutes later, our food was arrived.  Here is how it was..................  Fish Tacos-  These things looked great!  They hook you up with 4 nice sized tacos!  They came with double wrapped corn tortillas, a nice piece of tempura fried white fish which was both crunchy outside and moist inside,  some pickled onions and a little dollop of guacamole.  They usually come with a chipotle sauce, but I skipped that.  The tacos were mighty fine as they were.  Everything worked well!  They were legit fish tacos.  Maybe not as good as TJ Oyster Bar in SD, but they were damn good and better than a lot of fish tacos I have had.  I really liked the pickled onions!  They gave a nice little sweetness to the taco and they were buried under the actual fish.  These tacos were well constructed and just the right size to fill me up but not overstuff me.  The tacos also came with some black beans, and a side of "green tint" rice.  I sampled the beans, they were alright.  The rice had a unique seasoning to it.  Almost tasted a bit like pesto sauce, but then I caught a taste of something else.  Definitely unique, but I didn't finish all of it, mostly because I'm not the hugest fan of rice and/or beans.  Pasta Carbonara-  My wife thought it was a bit too "oily" so she couldn't finish it all.  I took her bowl of pasta from her and proceeded to have some.  I thought it was fine!  It had a nice sauce, lots of bacon, a little bit of chicken and a ton of peas in it.  I am anti pea, so I ate around all of those.  The noodles, bacon, sauce and chicken were very good.  I couldn't see myself eating a whole bowl of this (reason my wife couldn't finish it either) because it was pretty heavy, but a half portion or if you split this with someone, it was pretty tasty.  Service was fine.  Not great, not poor.  A-OK!  Total for everything was $0.00 thanks to the gift cards!  We skipped dessert and were on our way.  I would definitely come back and probably order the same thing.  Those fish tacos were no joke!  They were delicious as could be!

I have to say....I am becoming a huge fan of Whataburger.  Sure, its a little bit expensive for "fast food", but in the end its worth it.  They cook everything fresh, their burgers are always juicy and huge, their fries are always salted well, they have spicy ketchup!, and I recently found out that they have a secret weapon....its on their breakfast menu.... the Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit.  Wow!  A freshly fried crunchy chicken strip nestled inside a freshly baked buttery, soft biscuit and then they drizzle this thing with their honey butter mixture.  WOW!  Possibly the best breakfast biscuit sandwich out there (Chick Fil-A is good, but this one here is a notch above that) right now!  They are only like $2.29 too, which is not bad at all.  Everyone I have encountered at Whataburger is very friendly too!  I'm glad we have them here in AZ.  CA could sure use one!

Surprise, surprise...another pizza review.  I was looking to try a new pizza joint and this place came up in my Yelp search.  I decided to look up their menu online, and place an order for a 14 inch cheese pizza. This place is only about 8-10 minutes from work, about 2 miles off the 17 and Pinnacle Peak.  My total was just under $13.00.  I took the pizza back to work.  Here is how it was..............  Cheese Pizza-  It looked good.  The size was good.  The taste though?  Eh...it was just alright.  The cheese was plentiful and tasted alright.  The sauce was not that good though.  It seriously tasted like the jarred "pizza sauce" you can buy off the shelf at the grocery store.  It didn't have much flavor and for the most part, just wasn't good.  The crust on the pizza was fairly thin.  I kept picking up an odd taste in the dough.  It was kind of hard to describe, but it was far from good...like it had no flavor!  I struggled to make it through 4 slices which is incredibly rare.  If a pizza is good, I can put away a whole one.  Unfortunately, I gave the rest away to some fellow co workers.  The guy who answered the phone and the lady who rang me up were very friendly and nice.  Sadly though, the pizza was not really that good and I can't see myself ever coming back here.  Exactly what 2 stars is.....Meh.  I've experienced better pizza elsewhere.

Had this place bookmarked for a bit now and decided to head down here for lunch.  i went with the "Super Sicilian" which is their version of an Italian Sub.  That and a large fountain drink came out to just over $10.00.  Here is how it was.........  Super Sicilian-  This sub comes with 2 kinds of salami, 2 kinds of ham, capicolla, Swiss, pepper and provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and Italian dressing.  All of this comes on a toasted, seeded, Italian style roll.  First bite in, I knew it was a great sandwich!  The meats are cut rather thick (think hand carved), the cheese was incredibly melty, the produce was fresh as could be, and that roll had the perfect amount of toast/crunch on it, but never once hardened up like a crouton or anything like that.  The sesame seeds provided great texture and overall, I really liked it!  Definitely one of the better sandwiches I have had in Phoenix.  Overall, I will be back.  It is a bit of a journey down there, but the sandwich was great!  I really want to try out their chicken caccittori and meatball sub next.  Service was friendly, and this place is old school!  The only negatives I encountered were limited and tight parking, and their fountain lemonade was messed up and had too much syrup to water ratio (just add some more water to your beverage and it will dilute itself).  Other than those 2 minor gripes, it was a great sandwich and I am glad I made it down here.

Passed by this place a few times, and finally decided to stop.  I get a hankering for some street tacos every now and then.  Placed my order for 3 tacos total.  One carne asada on corn tortillas, one carne asada on a flour tortilla, and one pollo asado on a flour tortilla.  Total was $6.50 ($1.99 each).  Paid the lady my money, loaded up on some condiments (limes, pico, pickled onions and hot sauce), and took a seat.  A few minutes later, they brought out my tacos.  Here is how they were...........  Pollo Asado-  Their tacos come plain with just protein of choice and tortilla.  I added some lime, onions and hot sauce to my pollo taco.  Very tasty!  It was cubed chicken breast, chopped up.  It has a nice smokey flavor and was piping hot!  The tortillas are made in house (flour ones at least) and they provided a nice little crunch, yet soft chew at the same time.  The red hot sauce they have is pretty hot!  Made me sweat a bit.  Definitely a good taco.  I would even go as far as getting a pollo asado burrito next time.  I was impressed!  Carne Asada-  I've found a few spots in town that have respectable carne asada.  I can safely say that Asadero Toro is now in that group.  Their asada had a nice smokey flavor, no gristle, and a great taste to it.  I topped my asada tacos with pico, limes, onions and hot sauce.  They double up the small corn tortillas and they tasted great!  The flour ones were a little bit better, but the corn tortillas were definitely good, too.  Same as the pollo, I would not hesitate to get a burrito stuffed with this carne asada.  It was really good and reminded me of some of my favorite joints from San Diego.  Overall, I was glad I stopped.  If I am craving some legit street tacos, this place definitely fits the bill!  Cashier was friendly, place was clean, and prices were pretty good for the quality of tacos.  I'm not down in this area much, but even then, this is a spot I could see myself driving to from Surprise.  I will grab a burrito next time and maybe try out some of their other meats. If they are as good as the carne asada and the pollo, I will be a happy camper!

I heard this place was on its way out, so we decided to stop by today and check it out.  Is there a better mid afternoon snack than ice cream anyways?  If there is something better, please let me know :-).  I read their menu online the other day and decided what I wanted already before I even got there.  My wife and I walked in and were greeted by a nice lady, took a seat, and she brought out some glasses of ice water.  Nice touch!  This place SCREAMS old school ice cream parlor.  Pink and white walls, old school booths and chairs...there arent places like this left anymore and thats a damn shame.  I got a "Suicide".  Its 3 scoops of ice cream topped with hot fudge, caramel topping, whipped cream a cherry and some amazing toasted nuts....pecans, almonds and cashews.  This thing came in a huge glass.  It was super tasty.  The only thing wrong with it was that near the bottom, some of the ice cream had chunks/flakes of actual ice in it.  Maybe that flavor was old and stale?  Other than that, the flavors were great and those toasted nuts made the whole thing!  Big Lebowski quote...."The rug really tied the room together".  Well on this sundae, the nuts really tied the ice cream together. They were absolutely the greatest nuts I have ever had on an ice cream sundae.   My wife got a brownie sundae with pecan/toffee ice cream and hers was topped with the toasted pecans.  I had a couple of bites of hers and it was delicious too.    Total damage after tip was $21 bucks.  A tad steep for some afternoon ice cream, but it was delicious and the memory of sitting down in the cool, old school shop was priceless.  Im glad I got here before it closes its doors for good.

A few weeks ago, I was on a nacho kick.  I came here for lunch one day and decided to try out some nachos.  I ordered the Caramba Super Nachos with Chicken.  I had a water to drink.  Total was right around $8.00.  They give you a little bowl of chips with your order.  I paid the lady my money and then took a seat.  A few minutes later, my nachos were up.  Here is how they were............  Caramba Super Nachos-  Before my nachos were even ready, I was really digging on their chips.  They are thin, crispy and pretty darn delicious.  I soon realized that these were HORRIBLE chips for nachos though.  They were too thin and broke apart way too easily.  These nachos were topped with the usual toppings like cheese, beans, pico, sour cream, guacamole etc.  They came with 2 types of cheese....shredded and nacho.  I'm not the biggest fan of nacho cheese on taco shop nachos.  I prefer just shredded cheese.  The nacho cheese tasted ok though so it wasn't nasty.  The chips were really a killer though.  I probably only had about 5-10 chips that I could actually scoop stuff up with.  The rest of the chips were too flimsy, broke in half, or were covered with toppings.  I gave up pretty quick and grabbed my fork, mixed everything together and ate it like it was a nacho salad.  The chicken they use is a little funky too.  I'm pretty sure its boiled.  It didn't have much flavor and was too "wet".  I picked around most of it.  Overall, not the least bit impressed.  I doubt I am coming back to try out any of their other offerings.  It wasn't gross/disgusting food, and I did eat most of the nachos,  but for the price and taste, I will be heading elsewhere in the future.

I saw something online that said, "When your Waffle House cook is outside smoking a cigarette when you pull up, your meal will probably be great!"  Me and my buddies decided to come to Waffle House late night after Padre Murphys for St. Patricks day.  When we did pull up, turns out our eventual cook WAS outside talking with someone (not smoking).  Was that a good sign?  We should soon find out..............  We walked inside and grabbed a booth.  The booths are a little bit tight here.  4 people would not be comfortable eating at one booth.  You could sit in the booth, but there is little elbow room and the actual tables aren't that big.  When your food comes out, its a Tetris puzzle on where to put stuff to make everything fit.  Anyways...........  Our waitress was incredibly patient, funny, friendly and chipper!  I decided to go with a regular waffle, and a triple order of hashbrowns with cheese and onions.  I had a water to drink.  I like the fact that there is an open kitchen here.  You can see everything being made fresh to order.  A few minutes later, my food was ready.  Here is how it was................  Waffle-  You ARE at the "Waffle House".  You should probably get one, right?  Their waffles are delicious!  A little bit soft, but full of flavor.  They serve them with a nice dollop of soft butter and then you pour your own syrup on top.  Maybe not the best waffle I have ever had, but still solid and it hit the spot!    Hash Browns-  These were great!  I ordered way too many though.  Could have gone with a double order and left full.  I ordered them with cheese and onions.  They only threw one slice of cheese on mine, which was weird.  You would think with a triple order, they would coat each rectangular piece of hash browns with a slice of cheese, but they did not.  They did layer the onions really well though.  They were very tasty hash browns and I would get them again.  I enjoyed my meal, and so did my friends.  It's real close to work, and I'm not sure why I had never gone there before.  It is open 24-7 and I'm sure at some point I will be back for another tasty waffle and crispy, delicious hash browns.

Sometimes I forget to bring my lunch to work.  I have an hour lunch so I get in my car and drive.  I wound up in this parking lot and it was either Chick Fil A, some teriyaki place, or here.  At the time, a cheesesteak sounded good.  I walked in and placed my order for a large cheesesteak, fries and a drink.  The "combo" was a little over $10.00.  Here is how the food was................  Cheesesteak-  A bit skimp.  They cook the meat and onions together on the grill.  The steak was like steak ums and the onions were sparse.  This was topped with provolone cheese and then sandwiched between a toasted roll.  It was just alright.  Not nasty, but not delicious either.  If you get a sandwich here, opt for the extra meat...even then, the quality of the meat isn't that great so you still may be disappointed.  At least the roll was pretty good.  Fries-  These were bordering on decent.  They fry them fresh but that doesn't make them good.  They were not salted either.  I had to douse them in tons of ketchup to make them edible.  They were cut a little too thick....too "starchy" and too dang hot for my liking too.  Burned my mouth.  I'd skip them if there is ever a "next time".  Coke products and they did have Coke Zero at the fountain which was a positive!  Overall, it was just an ok lunch.  $10.00 isn't outrageous for a lunch combo, but the skimpness of the sandwich and the not so great fries will keep me from heading back.  They do have a survey you can take and get a code for free fries and a drink on your next visit...that's a decent deal right there if you enjoy their food.  Service was friendly, but the food was just average.  Meh.  I've experienced better.

I was craving some fried chicken, and I hadn't been to a Church's since I was back in Alabama a few years back.  I signed up for their app and they instantly provide you with coupons.  The coupon was for 4 chicken strips, small fries and a biscuit for $3.99.  Not bad...not bad at all.  I drove down, got my food and took it back to work.  Here is how it was...........  Chicken Strips-  They were very tasty!  Church's uses a real light batter but it's still plenty crunchy and tasty.  My chicken strips were a little uneven though.  I had 2 giant strips and then 2 super skinny strips.  I guess they evened each other out, but if you got all 4 skinny strips, that would suck.  I got some honey mustard and honey BBQ for the dipping sauces.  They were both really good and worked well with the juicy chicken strips!  Small Fries-  Crinkle cut.  Salted well.  They were alright.  Biscuit-  My favorite part of the meal.  Church's kind of dips/glazes their biscuits in honey.  They have a slight crunch when you bite into them but then they are soft in the middle.  They are kind of in the shape of a large macaroon cookie.  The biscuit was very good!  Service was extremely fast and friendly.  Not sure how often I will be coming back down here, but if a chicken craving hits, I could definitely see myself coming back.

I hadn't had Chinese food in forever and a day.  After reading my Yelp friend Rick R's review, I knew that I would have to try this spot out.  I woke up Sunday and decided that I would head on down.  I parked out front, walked in, was seated at a table and placed my order.  I went with a cup of Won Ton Soup, an order of Egg Rolls (Free with Yelp check-in!  Score!), and an order of Orange Chicken.  I also ordered some Fried Rice.  Here is how everything was.............  Won Ton Soup-  This was only $1.50 a cup.  It had 2 won tons in it and a nice amount of green onions.  The flavor of this soup was good. The temperature though, was not.  The broth wasn't really hot and just kind of warm.  The won tons were good though..nice and soft and chewy.  If this soup would have been a little bit hotter in temperature, it would have been excellent.    Egg Rolls-  What?  Free with Yelp check-in?  Yup!  Super stoked on that!  These things came out and they were massive!  Possibly the biggest egg rolls I have ever seen.  They are served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce.  The egg rolls were great!  Piping hot, fried perfectly, and stuffed with the usual egg roll ingredients.  These were really good and I would order them again even if they weren't free.    Orange Chicken-  Orange chicken is usually a good "test" item.  If a place can make a decent/good orange chicken, their other dishes are usually pretty solid.  Happy to say, Wong's makes a really good orange chicken.  The batter is a bit different than most places I have had it at before.  It's a lighter batter, with a different texture.  Almost like a panko encrusted chicken. The sauce they use is sweet but not overpowering.  The pieces of chicken were cut thin too, and they absorbed all the sauce rather well.  I would definitely get this again.  It was even better heated up later on that night for seconds!   Fried Rice-  I saw on the menu that a plain order of fried rice was only $3.00.  I thought that's what I was ordering.  Turns out, I was never charged for fried rice.  They included it as my rice side for my orange chicken!  Score!  The plain fried rice was very plain..just rice that had been fried pretty quick.  No veggies, no egg etc.  It was decent.  I have had better fried rice elsewhere, but the fact that it was included in my meal for no extra charge, gets bonus points on my end ;-).  Overall, I had a very good meal here!  Like I said with the chicken, I actually enjoyed my leftovers just as much as eating it there in the restaurant. I pretty much made 2 full meals for around $13.00. The portions were very big!  Also, the 2 ladies that waited on me were incredibly kind.  The main lady (cashier? owner?) was very friendly and asked me where I came from, how I heard about the Yelp check-in etc.  Very personable and made you feel at home!  I now know where to get good Chinese food in the West Valley!  I'm sure I will be back to try out some other dishes soon enough!

4.5 Stars.  Meatball sandwich week?  I was craving another one today and decided to head down to Romanelli's.  It's only a few exits down the road from work and the reviews seemed pretty good!  I walked in and placed my order for a Meatball Sandwich.  (The going rate for a meatball sandwich in Phoenix is about $9.00-10.00).  Total was just under $10.00.  I paid my ticket at the register in the front of the store and then grabbed my sandwich. Here is how it was.........  Meatball Sandwich-  This was excellent!  They take a loaf of home made bread, slice it up right then and there, pile it with about 6-8 meatballs halves, top it with cheese and then pop it in the toaster oven!  The end product was great!  The bread was toasty, yet soft when you bit into it.  The meatballs had great texture and consistency, the cheese was melted perfectly, and the sauce/gravy they use is awesome!  It was a thicker sauce and was flavored perfect...not too sweet, and not bitter either. Overall, just a damn fine meatball sandwich!  Might be the best one I have had so far in Phoenix!  Overall, I was impressed!  The place is family owned and they have been open for over 40 years.  They have a deli counter as well as a whole little store with all sorts of Italian goodies (Sauces, bread, peppers, olives, cookies, etc). They have plenty of seating, too!  I will definitely be back to have another meatball sandwich and try out some of their cold subs as well.   Service was very friendly and while I was there, it seemed like lifelong, repeat customers kept coming in to grab something to eat.  Good stuff!

Every now and then, I crave a Wendy's Double Stack.  Today was one of those days.  The Double Stack clocks in at $1.99 nowadays, but it's still a great price for a small, compact, but juicy, beefy burger.  They come topped with mustard, ketchup, onion and pickle.  Pretty simple and pretty delicious.  2 of those and a small chocolate Frosty are a filling meal for just over $5.00.  I prefer Wendy's burgers over the other two big chains (McDonalds and Burger King), mainly because they cook your burger fresh, hot off the grill, every single time!   Drive thru lady was friendly and Wendy's ALWAYS has the fastest drive thru service of any fast food place.  I'm sure I will be back.

Everyone once in awhile, you just need some Jack in the Box tacos!  I was craving them and decided to head on down to grab a few.  As others have stated, the guy (manager?) working the drive thru was super nice and chipper and the tacos were probably the best JITB tacos I have had in quite some time.  Most of the time, they are soggy in the middle and oily and greasy, but these ones today were fantastic!  Crispy the whole way through, the perfect amount of lettuce and sauce and everything worked well!  The only difference was the price...they were always 2 for $.99 (Price never changed, kind of like the Costco hot dog deal) but they have raised the price up to $1.19 now.  Still, for $2.50 you get 4 tacos and that is enough to fill you up.  I was impressed with this particular JITB and it is the closest one to work, so I know I will be back eventually.

Taco Bell is my fast food guilty pleasure.  I crave that shit, A LOT!  This is the closest Taco Bell to work, so I find myself here once or twice a month.  Typical Taco Bell.  I enjoy their crunchy tacos, regular nachos, beefy Fritos burrito, as well as some of their new (aka, same ingredients, just repackaged into something else) stuff like the Quesalupa.    What sets this one apart from other Taco Bells though is the hookup of hot sauces!  I hate when you ask for A LOT of sauce, and they throw maybe 1 sauce per item and occasionally one or two more in the bag.  At this Taco Bell, when you ask for A LOT of sauce, they don't fuck around!  They grab a huge fucking handful of sauces and throw them in the bag.  I ordered 4 items the other day, and was provided with about 20 sauces!  Score!  I think I might slang them on the black market!  If you want the goods, give me a call at 1-623-HOT-SAUC!  Call now and you can get BOGO!  Hurry up, the lines are lighting up as we speak. We are down to 860 hot sauces left...get them while you can.  Operators are available now!

Damn...take out that second mortgage before catching a game here.  1 star is even a stretch!    My buddy was in town (Padre fan) and wanted to watch them play at a different stadium other than their home field on 83rd in Peoria.  I had never been down here to this stadium, so we decided that we would try to catch a game here.  The Padres were playing the Giants at 7pm on Friday night.  I went online to buy tickets, and almost passed out from shock!  Lawn seats were $39.00.  Yes, you heard that right....a LAWN SEAT aka GENERAL ADMISSION was $39.00.  I know we are in Scottsdale, but Jesus Christ!  It's a Spring Training game for crying out loud!  When I saw those prices, there was no way in hell I was going to pay that much to watch a Spring game.  My buddy wound up getting some tickets through a rewards program at work, so technically they didn't cost us anything out of pocket.  He got us some bleacher seats.  Just for shits and giggles, I looked up the prices of bleacher seats.......$70.00!  Once again, are you fucking serious?  $70.00 to sit on a metal bench down the 3rd base line?  I pretty much threw up in my mouth.  Anyways.....enough of that.  With tickets in hand, we headed on down to Scottsdale.    We found free parking a few blocks down (the only positive thing I can say about this trip) and made our way up to the stadium.  I like the spot its situated in, but once we walked through the gates, I don't have anything else positive to say.  Here are my beefs..........  1.  Bleacher seating-  They are 100 foot long rows of bleachers.  One way in, one way out.  If you are seated on the end, not near the walkway, have fun shuffling past about 40 people to get to your seat. 2.  Standing room only-  They have a huge hill where you can stand in the outfield to try and watch the game.  Its the smallest and worst area I have ever seen for SRO.  Unless you get there way early, find a piece of land to stake your claim near the actual fence, good luck enjoying trying to watch the game from any decent angle.  The other problem circles back to those bleacher seats.  The bleachers are all up and down 1st and 3rd base, so while walking around the stadium, there are NO sight lines.  It's a horrible set up.   3.  Concessions-  I understand that things are expensive at the stadiums.  I have no problem shelling out a few bucks for certain things.  I saw some of the prices of things, and once again, threw up in my mouth.  A beer was $11.50!  An Its It Ice Cream Sandwich (Greatest thing ever, btw) was $7.50!  Damn, Gina!  Its its are really really good, and they are my favorite ice cream sandwich ever,  but not $7.50 good! 4.  Bathrooms-  I went into 2 different restrooms and each one had only one urinal and 2 stalls.  I know this is an older stadium, but with only 3 pissing receptacles available, lines were incredibly long just to take a leak. 5.  The Giants fans in general.  I have many friends that are Giants fans and none of them are douchebags, so I know that ALL Giants fans aren't complete tools.  Besides the direct people I know though, most Giants fans I have encountered, are dicks.  They just have an aura about them that I don't like.  Very "smug".  Its the same thing I have experienced up at ATT.  Beautiful stadium, but you are surrounded by asshats. Thankfully, we found some SD folks to chill with for a few innings and had a good time.  Northern CA folks are just "different".  I much prefer the more laid back, chill vibe from Southern CA and get along better with people from Southern CA (LA and SD).   Well...that is about it.  I don't ever see myself coming back to this stadium.  It's way too expensive, sight lines are the worst I have ever seen at a ballpark, and the general douchebaggery of Giants fans will keep me away.

Got my DD fix twice this weekend.  This store was really nice.  I went to a rinky dink one on Friday and this one was the like the Taj Mahal compared to the other one in Tempe.  Got the wife and I some coffees and a couple of donuts.  My wife doesn't usually drink coffee but she liked it!  I'm the same way...I can care less about coffee but when its Dunkin Donuts coffee, I'm in!  I don't know what it is, but its always the perfect temperature to drink (not too hot) and they use the perfect amount of cream and sugar.  It just works!    I also tried out their new Oreo donut.  It was a winner!  White cream filled donut with white frosting and oreo cookie pieces crumbled on top.  It was an amazing donut and by far my favorite donut I have had from Dunkin Donuts.  I just wish these were widespread all over the great state of California (Only 2 at Camp Pendleton).  They would make a killing $$$$$.

If I could give this 4.5 I would.  Grimaldis is pretty damn awesome.  Its the best pizza you can get outside of NY and I have been to many of them.  This one was almost as good as the others except for a few things.  We went to eat in when we first got into town on Thursday.  We were the only people in there for about 15 minutes.  We placed our order but it took forever.  The manager came by and apologized and even said there would be a little discount on the bill.  We ordered our usual, large pepperoni and garlic pizza and we shared a small Mediterranean salad.  The salad came out pretty quick and it was tasty as usual.  The pizza finally came out and you know what?  It was a tad greasy.  Like greasy on the bottom.  I have never experienced that at any of the Grimaldis I have been to before.  The pizza tasted damn fine but somehow not as good as the NY/Las Vegas/Other Scottsdale locations.  We finished up our meal and they brought over the check.  There was no discount on it like the manager had said there would be.  I hate complaining so I didn't even say anything, but thats kind of messed up that they tell you there will be a discount for the long wait and then it never happens.  Semi weak sauce!  We ordered pickup 2 other nights we were there and that went smooth.  One night I had to go in and pick up my pizza from the bar.  The other evening, you just had to pull up out back and they brought it out to you which was nice.  Overall its still the best pizza you can get out here in the West.  The sauce, fresh mozzarella and thin crust cannot be beat.  Awesome pizza and thanks to the stupid EPA and coal ovens, we cant get one out here in CA.  Its a damn shame.  If Arnold would taste one of these pizzas, I bet he wouldn't give a shit if a tad more pollution enters our airspace ;-).  Grimaldis pizza is amazing and well worth it!

Came here again this past week.  Ordered a personal white pizza with cheese and a large pepperoni and garlic.  It was awesome!  Some of the best pizza ever!  It was better than last month when I came and that's why this is getting bumped up to 5 stars.  We got our stuff much quicker this time and our waitress and the manager were on top of everything.  A great meal before the Diamondbacks game.  Grimaldis pizza is simply the best!

Still the greatest pizza out here in the West!  My wife and I got a small garden salad, and our usual.....a large pepperoni and garlic pizza.  She had a glass of their new Sangria and I had a Pepsi.  Total after tip was about $45.00.  Well worth it in my opinion.  Simply the best pizza you can get outside of NY...and even then, this will give any pizza joint in NY a run for its money.

I had read about this place and had it on my bookmark list for quite some time.  I don't know how I never made it down here until the other day!  It was my 38th Birthday on Saturday (June 11th) and I was hanging out with a buddy from work and my brother in law.  I wanted to head down to Scottsdale and grab a sandwich here and then go smoke a cigar (see previous review).  We made our way down here around noon, walked in, got in line and ordered our sandwiches.  I went with a Large "Maximus".  My brother in law bought my lunch for me so I didn't pay squat ;-).  Regular price for that sandwich was around $10.00.  Here is how it was............  The Maximus-  This is a premium Italian sub!  Whenever I am new to a deli, I always tend to get their version of an Italian sub.  Happy to report, the Maximus is fantastic!  This sandwich came layered with Prosciutto, Capocollo, Genoa Salami, Mortadella and Provolone Cheese.  I got it topped with lettuce, tomato, onion and Italian dressing.  I chose the seeded sub roll as my bread.  This thing was set down in front of me and I was instantly happy!   This sub is huge!  A solid 12 inches or so.  The seeded bread they use was fantastic!  It had seeds on all sides of the bread, just not the top halves.  It was nice and soft and made an excellent base for the toppings.  Next time, I might ask for it slightly toasted/crisped up, because I think it would make it even better than it already was!  The meats were top notch quality and the produce was fresh.  The sandwich was just a tad dry and could have used more oil and vinegar, but besides that, it was damn near a perfect sub!  Definitely the best Italian sub I have had in Phoenix!    I will definitely be back to try out their other sandwiches.  I was highly impressed with the Maximus and if their other subs can come close to being as good as that one, I will be super satisfied.  Too bad its across the Valley, or I would be here way too often!  It was a great little store, and a fantastic birthday sandwich!  Good times!

I'm sorry, but this "Pumpkin Patch" was horrible!    We decided to take a drive down here to possibly get a pumpkin for our son and to partake in some of the activities.  We pulled up and found a parking spot way in the back lot.  To their credit, they do have a ton of parking.  We made our way up to the entrance and noticed a few things.  1.  This isn't really a pumpkin patch.  It's some barrels of hay with pumpkins sitting on top of them. 2.  The pumpkins themselves were all ghetto.  A majority of them were deformed, dented, rotting and just didn't look like a typical pumpkin. 3.  The setup of this place is horrible!  You have about a foot of space to walk through, all the while, the line to purchase your pumpkin was snaking through the area as well.  One huge clusterfuck!  We lasted about 5 minutes.  Horrible layout! 4.  This place isn't in the "hood" per say, but the people that were mulling out and about were super white trash.  Reminded me of the El Cajon trolley station...if you know where that is, and know what kind of people hang around there, it describes what we saw here today perfectly.  I saw multiple chicks in daisy dukes and Ugg boots as well as tons of people pawning their kids off to their spouse so that they could light up their cigarette.  Anyways...who am I to judge, right? ;-) 5.  We never even made it inside for the "activities".  Entrance was $9.00 from what it looked like and then all the other fun was extra $$.  Like I said earlier, we lasted there about 5 minutes.    I would never come back.....not even during the week when nobody is there.  It was a wasted drive down here and I have no idea why people would ever want to come here.  There has to be better pumpkin patches in Arizona, right?  I sure as hell hope so.  This one was whack!

My friend from work had a drained/dead battery.  I drove to her house and gave her a jump start.  We then drove down here to get a new one.  She recently purchased the car and the dude who sold it to her said that he just bought a new battery and that if there was any problem with it, it would still be under warranty and take it to this shop and they should be able to exchange it.  We get down here and find out that her battery is over 10 years old and is completely dead!  She decided to get a used battery for the time being just so that her car would operate properly until she sorted out the issue with the seller of the car.  Long story short, the guys at Interstate were freaking awesome!  Sammy and some other young kid (didn't catch his name..my bad) were extremely helpful and friendly.  They tested the battery, had someone else take a look at it for a second opinion, sold her the new battery and even installed it for her out in the parking lot!  The whole time, we were joking around and talking about Phoenix and life in general. Shit...they even hooked us both up with free bottles of water while we waited. They provided excellent customer service and were very personable the whole visit through.  Even though I was just a 3rd party observing all of this, I could tell right away that this shop is legit.  If I ever need a new car battery, I will probably head here to get one solely based off the great service received from Sammy and his coworker.  Great job fellas!

My buddy had never been to an NHL game before.  He cruised down from Vegas this weekend, and we decided to go to a Coyotes game.  He got us tickets through a rewards program at work, and they were right near the goalie.  Section 102, Row F.  Best seats I have ever sat in at a hockey game.  Parking was $20.00, right outside the entrance (I have since learned that there is free parking available).  Seats were comfy, ushers were friendly and nice, and everything was great!  My buddy even got a puck!  I guess during warmups, a puck flew over the glass, and the guy next to us didn't see where it went.  During the National Anthem, when my buddy was about to sit down, he looked under his seat, and saw the puck!  Great souvenir for being his first NHL game!   Coyotes lost 2-0, but it was a great time.  I really liked the arena and would definitely come back!

Had to stay in a hotel one night before I could move in to my new house.  This was the Hotwire 2.5 star hotel in Surprise/Sun City.  $54 out the door after taxes and fees and such.  I was impressed!  Check in and out was a breeze.  Friendly front desk.  The rooms were very nice.  4 comfy pillows, a nice king sized bed with a comfy mattress, soft sheets etc.  The bathrooms were fairly new from the looks of it.  They also provide you with 2 bottles of Dasani in your room for free!  That is a nice touch being out here in the sweltering heat!  I did have a little problem connecting to the wifi but I called the tech support number and they helped me out.  I would definitely stay here again!

I have never stayed the night here at the Wynn but I have gambled here lots and this review is solely for that purpose......as well as a few other cool things they offer.  We usually stay at the Riviera because of free rooms.  The Wynn is the next casino down...well technically its Encore but same difference.  We always head down here the morning after we get into Vegas.   The Wynn is a beautfiul casino.  My lady and I mostly play slots and the Wynn has a nice selection.  There are 3 things that I absolutely love about the Wynn and here they are.  1.  Excellent drink service.  No matter if you are a high roller or a penny slot person, the waitresses are plentiful, beautiful, and always on top of things.  They actually give you your mixed drink in a nice round glass that you would use at home.  Not a tall skinny, full of ice glass.  A nice touch.  They bring the drinks fast and are appreciative for any tip you give them.   The booze is always flowing and that keeps customers happy.  2.  The buffet.  Best buffet I have been to....havent been to many....but this one is at the top.  If you sign up for a players club card you have to gamble something like a few hundred dollars(points) to get enough for a buffet.  Its awesome and easy to accomplish the free buffet within an hour or 2 playing.  I think its like 35 bucks for the dinner one if you have to pay for it.  It has everything you could want including gigantic crab legs which cant be beat.  3.  Sometimes its the little things that matter most.  This may sound odd but my number 3 favorite thing here....the bathrooms.  If you have to drop a deuce they have very private stalls that look like a closet sort of.  Total privacy.  And my favorite thing in the bathroom are the urinals.  They have strategically placed "pads" in the urinals.  One up top and one at the bottom.  This kills 2 birds with one stone.  You have to take a mean leak and you go to piss and you get some brushback....guys...you know what I mean.....your piss hits the bowl and then sprays back at ya....you try to avoid it but some urinals it just happens.  Well these urinals here at the Wynn use the pads to  a. cover up odor...and b. to prevent sprayback.  No matter how hard you try , if you hit the pad, it like absorbs your piss with no shrapnel flying everywhere.  Its awesome and its my favorite bathroom to take a leak in.  Its the little things in life.....the small victories.........and that my friends is why the Wynn gets 5 stars.

Slots A Fun.  An excellent low rollers paradise!  We were in Vegas for my bachelor party over the weekend staying at the Riviera.  Right across the street is this little gem.  If low limits are your thing, then this is the place to be.  They use to be one of, if not the only, place on the strip that would still give actual coins when you would win.  They have now changed that to the ticket system which is nice.  It always use to smell like barf too.  That has changed also.  They basically redid the whole place and now its much much nicer.   2 dollar Heineken and Coors Lights at the bar.  $1.00 minimum bet at the virtual blackjack table.  Lots of penny slots.  We spent most of our time here and had alot of fun.  Didnt lose too much money and got drunk as a skunk in the process.  Overall a fun place to chill if you have a large group of guys who like to drink and gamble a bit.

You may think Im crazy but I really do love the Riviera.  We just got back about an hour ago and stayed here Fri and Sat night.  Its one of the only places I stay when I go to Vegas becuase I get hooked up from  the players club....aka...I have dropped alot of coin in this place so they "reward" me with discount or free nights.  You cant complain on free rooms or at most 60 bucks a night on weekends.  You cant find that anywhere else in Vegas.  They remodeled most of the rooms and they are actually really nice now.  Good comfy beds, flat screen LG Tvs and actual brand name Bath and Body Works stuff in the bathroom.  As far as the casino, its kind of well......old.....the cool crowd doesnt hang out there thats for sure.  Drink service is always fast and plentiful and most of the time you can find $5-$10 blackjack tables.  My brother and I cleaned up one afternoon and both cashed out a couple hundred ahead.  Cant complain!  Not much around the Riviera.  Sahara down the strip.  Circus Circus across the street.  The Wynn is a few blocks down which is cool and thats where we go to gamble alot of the time.  If you want a nice room to sleep in on the cheap, please come here to the Riviera!  Its not as bad as people make it out to be.

I dont care what anyone else says.  I love the Riviera!  Free rooms-check!  Low limit tables-check!  $2 automated blackjack game-check!  Fast, friendly drink service-check!  Comfy beds-check!  Right next to The Peppermill-check!  We stayed here once again.  Why pay for a room when you are in Vegas?  A comfy bed is all you need, and the Riviera has super comfortable beds and they always have a free room available for me whenever I want to go.  Even if you had to pay for a room, they are extremely inexpensive.    The Riviera has a certain charm to it.   Its hard to describe, but once you realize it and take it in, you will appreciate it.  Its one of the last remaining OG casinos in Vegas.  I would much rather stay here on the cheap, then  spend $300 a night at the Aria or one of the newer hotels.  Give the Riviera a chance my friends.  You will grow to love it.

The best steak house I have ever been to.  Intimate setting, friendly staff, amazing food.  Had the porterhouse steak and my girlfriend had the New York strip.  Both tasty.  Salad, Bread, Baked potato and Steak all included in the price.  Excellent value.  Will go back for sure! My mouth is watering right now :-)  Update 03/31/07.  Went back again on Saturday night.  Went early to check on our reservations and lo and behold, they didnt have us marked down.  A little frustrating but the manager(sorry I cant remember his name) said to come in at 7 and they would see what they could do.  Got there at 7 and were seated immediately.  Excellent service by our waiter Felix.  Amazing food and amazing service once again.  I just want to thank the manager of the place for doing a great job and for excellent service by Felix.  This is the type of service that will keep me coming back every single time I am in Vegas!  Thank you to the entire crew at The Steakhouse!

Solid stadium.  We caught 2 games here against the Cardinals.  We went on my actual birthday which was sweet.  The Cardinals won 5-2, my wife got me a birthday surprise by announcing my birthday on the jumbo tron, and there were Friday night fireworks.  A perfect night!  The stadium is easy to get to, parking was cheap ($7 bucks right across the street from the stadium), prices were fair for a ballpark and the fans were mellow.  I guess they have been named the family friendliest ballpark in the majors and I can see why.  Ushers were nice and helpful etc.  They had the roof open on my birthday.  Its amazing how that works.  Like 15 minutes before the game they decided to open it up.  Its awesome just watching it open and then seeing the night sky above.  Quite a site to see.  It opens super fast too.   Overall a super nice stadium and one of the best ones I have been to.  I could see myself picking up some kind of season ticket plan if I lived out in AZ.

My review hasn't/won't change much from last time.  Chase Field is pretty damn awesome.  Everyone is friendly, the parking, the layout, concession prices etc are all fairly priced.  I only have one bad thing to say..............  The Upper Deck sucks!!!!!  We were in Section 311 on opening night.  Section 311 and the whole upper deck is horrible.  We were in row 25.  Know what you need when you are in Section 311 row 25?  You need some Gatorade, an energy bar, an oxygen tank and a box of Kleenex for your bloody nose.  Listen.....I'm a large man and I'm out of shape.  Even if I was in shape I would have had trouble getting up there.  The stairs pretty much go straight up.  Its super steep!  If you get nausea or dizzy spells,  I would avoid the upper deck at all costs.  25 rows up doesn't seem like much but once I got to like row 19, I could hear myself breathing heavy.  Old ladies were stopping midway up to catch their breath.  Even little kids who have shitloads of energy were not fond of climbing those stairs.  There were probably 20 more rows above us too!  I couldn't imagine scaling those stairs up to the top top rows.  Check this out too...they have concession guys up in these sections lugging huge boxes of stuff.  If you purchase something off of them and don't tip them at least a buck, you are a cheap bastard who should fall down the stairs ;-).  They work their ass off all night.....at least give them something!   Section 205 at tonights (Tuesday) game was much better.  No hiking stairs at all.  Plus the Cardinals won ;-).  I am driving back to SD in the morning a happy man.

Went here walking back to the hotel from the Riviera.  Excellent atmosphere.  Really quiet setting, kind of like they pump white noise into the place.  Got the patty melt and onion rings.  It was the best patty melt I have tasted in my entire life!!!  The onion rings were a little greasy but thats what made them so good!  Large portions and well worth the 10 bucks!  Highly recommended spot!  I will definately be back again when I venture out to Vegas!

The Peppermill is always awesome!  Its right next door to the Riviera which is usually our home base.  We went there late night last night and a sudden craving for breakfast hit while I was staring at the menu.  I ordered the Lorraine omelet which had a ton of bacon, green onions and swiss cheese.  Their omelets are out of control.  They are GIGANTIC!  It was super tasty too!  It comes with a side of some awesome hashbrowns and 2 pieces of toast.  I got sourdough and it was perfect....they even butter up the bread for you too so all you have to do is apply the strawberry jelly.  I washed it down with a gigantic chocolate shake.  The wife ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup and had some of my hashbrowns.  It was another excellent meal, and the Peppermill remains one of my favorite spots in Vegas!

A long time coming........................  The elusive Delux Burger.  I have driven by this place half a dozen times during my missions to Phoenix.  We always use to go to a gelato place near here.  I always wanted to stop in and try a burger but never had time or already had eaten etc.  My buddy Dave G. has sung this burgers praises and last night was the night I would get to sample it.  I wish I had done so a long time ago.  It was fantastic!  One of the best burgers I have ever had.  I walked in and placed my order at the to go counter.  I ordered a Delux Burger medium rare.  Total came out to just under $13.00.  Sounds a bit steep for a burger, but it is well worth it.  I waited about 8 minutes or so and they brought out my burger.  I asked for a bunch of extra napkins and was on my way.  Took it out to the car, drove over to a spot under a light post (had to take a picture of it ;-) lol), placed the bag on my trunk and dug in.  Here is how it was...............................  Delux Burger-  Low carb be damned!  I was going to eat this thing and enjoy every second of it.  They slice this thing in half for you.  It comes on a baguette type roll.  It was very fresh, sturdy yet soft and is probably the perfect delivery system for this burger.  The burger itself is made from some high grade Nieman Ranch beef.  It was melt in your mouth tender.  They top this thing with some greens (arugala), 2 types of cheeses, and a sort of bacon jam (onions and bacon).  The whole thing worked perfect.  Savory meat, sweet bacon jam and a great bun were the overwhelming flavors.  I didn't taste the greens too much and the cheese, while you could tell it was there, didn't really add or subtract from anything.  Dave G.'s extra cheese may be the way to go next time.  This burger is hefty too.  I ate the first half and it was so juicy, flavorful, and big, I would have been satisfied with just half.  I'm no pussy though and devoured the other half immediately after.  I was sad when it was done :-(.  If I ever need a great burger, I know where to come.  It was absolutely delicious and I'm sure I will be back for another in the near future.

My buddy is moving to Phoenix, he needed somewhere to park his car for a week (my house), and he needed a ride to the airport.  He let me know that he was buying lunch on the way down to the airport.  I hadn't been to Delux in about 6 months and a burger sounded great. I mentioned to him how good their burgers were (Best in Phoenix!), and he wanted to try it out.  Free Delux Burger?  Yes...yes indeed!    We walked in, were seated immediately and served water (the waiter instinctively brought my son his own plastic cup with a lid on it...I appreciated it.).  I noticed that they had a little pop up flyer/table piece that was advertising their "Lunch Special" between 12-4 any day of the week, you could get a Delux burger and fries for $12.00.  Um.....SOLD!   I ordered my Delux burger medium rare and got regular fries (you have your choice of sweet potato also).  Here is how it was.........  Delux Burger-  Nothing has changed!  And that is exactly what I wanted to see.  Delux burger is hands down the best burger in Phoenix, and it's definitely in my top 3 burgers in the USA.  They use superb quality Niman Ranch beef, which is absolutely perfect when cooked medium rare.  Juicy, tasty and flat out delicious.  The baguette they use is perfect.  Its sturdy, yet soft and chewy and is the perfect bread for this type of burger.  Sandwiched between this great bread and on top of the burger are blue and gruyere cheese, some baby arugula, and their caramelized onion/bacon jam/spread.  The flavors work so well together, its absolute perfection.  Find a better burger in Phoenix.  I dare you!  The fries were good (the few that I had, because my son, Bill, mowed down 80% of my fries, as well as about half of my buddies.)    Can't say enough about Delux!  Service is always friendly, the food is always fantastic, and every single person I have brought here, has loved it.  Don't change a thing, Delux...don't change a thing!  See you soon for another fantastic burger!

My wife and I had been to the other Chino Bandido a few years ago.  I saw that this place was within reasonable driving distance from work (4 miles) and since we have hour lunches, I decided to drive down.  I walked in, filled out my card on what I wanted (for those that don't know....Chino Bandido is a fusion cuisine that allows you to mix and match different items.  You fill out a card with a pen and write down what you want...endless combinations are available pretty much)  and then paid the man my money.  A few minutes later, I had my sack of food and was on my way out the door.  Here is what I ordered..................  I went with a 2 item combo and decided to get 2 quesadillas (Jen Red Pork and Jade Red Chicken) black beans and pork fried rice.  The total for this huge monstrosity was $9.10.  Here is how everything tasted.............  Jen Red Pork Quesadilla-  This thing was delicious.  It was pretty much sweet and sour pork wrapped in a tortilla with cheese.  They kind of "fry/griddle" their tortillas so they have a bit of a crunch/crisp to them.  They stuffed this to the gills with tons of crunchy/sweet/hot pork.  Jade Red Chicken-  Very similar to the Jen Red Pork except that it was chicken.  Think sweet and sour chicken.  I was very impressed with my 2 quesadilla combo.  It was almost too much though.  I wound up stuffed and couldn't even finish two 1/4s of each quesadilla.  Black Beans-  I'm usually not a fan of beans.  These beans were absolutely delicious though.  They are as black as the night sky and they came covered with a bunch of cheese.  They reminded me of a sort of refried bean but way more delicious.  It was almost like a giant bean dip.  Alternating bites of beans and quesadilla was a killer combo.  Pork Fried Rice-  This was pretty good.  I left a lot of it in the container just because I was so damn full from everything else.  This was a moister fried rice with little pieces of pork in it.  Was it the best fried rice ever?  Nah.  Did it work with the combo of everything else?  Yeah.    Snickerdoodle-  They hook you up with a cookie for dessert.  The sugar cookie was delicious.  Soft and chewy and sweet.  It was the first cookie I have had in months.  Everything was really tasty!  You could probably split a 2 item combo between 2 people.  I tried my darnedest  to finish everything and didn't even come close.  They definitely hook up the portions!   I will definitely be back to try out more combos.  The choices are endless and the food is delicious.  Service was friendly too.  I'm glad this place is nearby!

Its like a crack addiction.  Try it once, and you get hooked.  I had some last night at the Scottsdale location and decided to come here after lunch today to get my fix.   We got there right at 12pm and they werent open yet.  About 5 minutes later they opened the doors.    I went with a 3 scoop combo that consisted of pistachio, caramelo and chocolate.  The chocolate was my favorite again.  Its sooooooo good that words cant even describe it.  The pistachio was super tasty as well.  The caramelo was fine but I probably wouldnt get it again.  The chocolate is too good and I would replace the caramelo with an extra scoop of chocolate.  My wife got a waffle cone with chocolate fudge brownie and birthday cake funfetti.  She gave me a few bites and both those flavors were delicious too.  If you see me on a corner hawking a VCR, just know that is to fund my habit for this amazing gelato.  Damn its good!

Finally got to try this place out tonight.  Long overdue, but I was glad that I made it down here.  My Yelp buddy Kate and I had planned on coming down here a few weeks ago but it didn't pan out.  Tonight worked though and we met here for some dinner.  I found parking on the street (randomly, right behind their car lol..St. Louis Cardinal fans can smell each others cars I guess) and walked a block down.  The restaurant is really cool.  It's an old converted house which is funky and awesome in it's own way.  Kate and her husband got there before me and grabbed us a table inside.   I sat down and ordered a Diet Coke to drink.  Kate and her husband had already ordered some appetizers for us (Polpette- Meatballs and Straccetti- Fried pieces of pizza dough topped with tomato sauce and parmigano and basil).  We then placed our order for our pizzas.  Me and Kate decided to split 2 pizzas so we could try out some different things.  We went with a basic Margherita and we also went with a white pizza called the Rustica which came with procsiutto and arugala.  Kates husband ordered the Calzone.  Here is how everything tasted...............  Appetizers:  Polpette-  They serve this dish with 3 meatballs which were topped with some grated cheese and a few slices of crusty bread.  These meatballs were very good!  They were tender and delicious.  The sauce these were in was very tasty too!   Straccetti-  These come about 9 to a plate.  They are little strips of dough...think, funnel cake/churro bites, but made out of regular dough.  They are topped with their delicious sauce and basil strips.  These were great too!  They seriously reminded me of little churro pieces but without the sugar on them.  Great fried dough and a definite repeat too.    Pizza/Calzones:  Margherita-  I usually order a plain pizza when I'm trying a new place out.  You can tell a lot about a pizza place just by their cheese pizza.  This rendition was pretty good.  Not as good as some other places in town, but still a tasty pizza.  I liked their sauce, cheese and crust.  I didn't like that they put too much basil on it plus it was cut really odd.  There were like 2 huge gigantic pieces and then 6 real small ones.   It was a tad thin in parts too.  Still, a good pizza but not a "great" pizza.  Rustica-  This was a white pizza (olive oil base) topped with prosciutto and arugala after it was cooked.  I didn't like this one nearly as much.  It sounded way better than it tasted.  It tasted like regular ham on pizza plus the arugala threw me off.  I don't need no stinking salad on my pizza!  I never had this kind of pizza before so I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't get it again.  This one was cut irregularly and a bit thin in spots too.  Calzone-  This may have been the best item ordered.  Louie chose well!  This calzone is a huge, football shaped pocket of goodness.  It had a great outer crust and it was stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta, some kind of spicy salame/pepperoni and some other stuff too.  I only had a little sample of it, but I would definitely get it again if I come back.   It was tasty and better than the 2 pizzas we got.  Total bill was ?.  Louie grabbed the check before I could see it.  I threw in some money for a tip, we sat around and talked for a bit and then we were on our way.  Service was very friendly and attentive.  I liked the vibe of the place too.  I could see myself coming back for sure.  The food was like a 3, but the vibe, company I was with,  and the service bring it up to a 4 star joint!

Hell yeah boy!!!!!  This place was awesome!  I spent about 2 hours here and only spent 10 bucks.  This place is a trip!  Soooooo many different games.  I played a lot of Terminator and South Park.  I even got a few free games on Pinball Circus.  I just walked up to it and hit start and it let me play.  Then it let me play a second game.  I thought the fun would last forever, but it asked me to insert money after game 2.   I am not even the biggest pinball fan out there but this place is one of a kind!  Its something to experience at least once when you are in Vegas!

So....my buddies from Vegas are in town and we decided to stop by here last night.  I woke up this morning and noticed on my home page that this was the ROTD for today.  Pretty cool how that worked out, eh?  Its like we were psychic!  JK.  Lol.  I was driving last night so I did not partake in any beverages.  My buddy absolutely loved the drinks he got though.  He got  two Diamondbacks and some other mango crafted cocktail.  My other buddy got a beer.  They enjoyed their libations.  This place is super duper chill! It reminded me of Mercury Lounge up in Goleta/Santa Barbara.  There was a group of about 8 dudes shooting pool and then a handful of other people just hanging out at the bar.  The bartender seemed extremely friendly.  This place has awesome ceiling fans too!  They don't have blades on them from what I could see and they sort of looked like upside down roulette wheels. Never saw a fan like this before.  They definitely worked though and cleared the room of my buddies vape smoke.  We only stayed about an hour, but this is a place I could definitely see coming back to.    Two last tips...like others have said before.  Watch out for those little couches by the bar.  They sink down pretty low and it takes a second to get up.  Super comfy though!  And.......parking is tight. Only 4 spots or so in the back.  Plenty of street parking though.  Overall, a great little dive that I hope to make it back to someday in the future.

Saw this place on a couple of Food Network shows and it sounded good so we headed on down to try it out.  Mexican/Chinese combo plates....Im listening!  We walked in and were greeted by a nice lady who asked if we had ever been here before.  We told her no and she had a guy take us over to the "sample station".  They give you about 5 different samples of stuff and then show you how to fill out the little card to place your order.  I decided to go with a combo of a jerk chicken quesadilla, jade red chicken and pork fried rice.  My wife went with a plain bean and cheese burrito, and a veggie quesadilla.  You place your order and then grab your drink and sit down and wait for them to bring your food out to your table.    About 15 minutes later our food came out.  It was awesome!  The jerk chicken quesadilla was bomb!  Its pretty spicy and had a great overall flavor.  The jade red chicken is their specialty and it lived up to the hype.  A couple pieces could have been a bit more moist, but it was really good overall.  Excellent fried rice too.  My wife said her burrito was good, kind of average, just pinto beans and cheese wrapped up.  I took a couple bites of her veggie quesadilla and it was alright.  It had what looked like some nacho cheese in it, where as my jerk chicken quesadilla had shredded cheeses in it.  Good none the less.  The grand finale was a free cookie they bring out.  It was a snickerdoodle type cookie and it had lots of sugar on it and was still a bit warm from the oven.  A perfect end to an awesome meal.  Total damage for everything was $19.00 and change.  The staff was super nice and helpful and if I lived here, I would have this in my regular rotation of places to eat.

My friend Kate M. had mentioned that she had wanted to have lunch here sometime.  Today, the stars aligned and we (wife and son) drove down here to meet Kate and her husband for a late lunch.  This place has always piqued my interest, and honestly, I'm not sure why I never had lunch/dinner here before.  We drove down and met them at 2pm.  Kate and her husband were already there and grabbed us a table and high chair for our son Bill.  They had ordered Some Q-Rolls (basically an egg roll stuffed with smoked brisket) and some drinks already and offered me up a Q-Roll.  These things were good!  They serve them with chipotle and a bbq sauce.  I could definitely see myself eating a whole order of these things.    I had read some reviews of this place and it sounded like most people enjoyed the ribs.  Who doesn't like ribs?  I decided to go with the 2 Rib Combo (St. Louis and baby back) which came with 2 sides.  I chose ranch beans and french fries for my sides.  Had a Diet Pepsi to drink.  My wife ordered a brisket sandwich and some mac and cheese for her side.  Pretty much ordered the fries and mac and cheese for our son.  You will have to read Kates review about what she and her husband ordered ;-).  Before they bring out your food, they give you a basket of cornbread.  This stuff was great!  I ate 2 pieces of it and could have ate more.  Anyways....on to the main dishes.  Here is how everything was...............  Rib Combo-  Delicious!  These ribs were so tender they fell off the bone.  I know some BBQ purists will say that ribs should not fall off the bone, but I don't give a shit...these ribs were delicious!  I ate the baby backs first.  They were awesome!  They came covered in minimal sauce so the meat really stood out.  I dug straight in with my hands and would just pick pieces of meat off the bone and savor every bite.  They were delicious and I can see why so many people order them here.  After the baby backs, I got into the St. Louis style ribs.  These were not as good as the baby backs, but they were still pretty damn tasty.  They were cooked so well, that even up at the cartilage portion, there was minimal of it and you could pick through and get every single little morsel of meat.  All that was left on the plate was pretty much bones and a few pieces of cartilage.  These ribs were 5 star ribs!  Sides-  This is where I was a little let down.  I love, love, love some good beans.  I prefer some baked beans, lots of sauce, cooked well done so they are thick, and lots of scraps of meat throughout.  These beans had some meat in them, but they were "ranch style" beans and just alright....a little runny.  The sauce was good enough to hold them together, but I have had much better beans elsewhere and would not get these again.  The portion was skimp too!  It was like 5 spoonfuls worth.  The fries were really thin shoestring fries.  They were pretty good.  My son loved them...he loves pretty much any french fry.  They are his favorite food, by far!  The problem with really thin shoestring fries is that they tend to get hard/cold fast.  They were still pretty good though and I would get them as a side again.  Really big portion of them, too!  My wife gave me a piece of her brisket from her sandwich.  It was legit.  She thought that her brisket sandwich was a little bit too plain/boring though.  The side of mac and cheese was good.  Really cheesy, Velveeta type mac and cheese.  Decent portion size too.  Not sure why the beans were such a skimp portion.  Everything else was hooked up!  Oh yeah..when you are done with your meal they provide you with some free mini donuts.  A bit skimp (3 tiny donuts for 3 people), but free so I can't complain.  They tasted like a lemon pound cake, deep fried and then rolled in sugar.  I could mow down a dozen!  They were delicious!  I just wish they maybe gave you 3 per person...then we would be talking!  Service was great!  They had multiple people servicing our table throughout the whole meal and everyone was on point!  I think even the manager came by to ask how everything was.  Conversation was great, too.  It was the first time Kate and her husband met my wife and son.  A good time was had by all!  Will I be back?  Yes, at some point for sure.  The ribs were absolutely fantastic, and with the right choice of sides, this is a damn fine BBQ meal and a potential 5 star joint!  It wasn't the cheapest lunch ($63.00 after tax/tip), but for my first time here, the amount of food,  and the people I was with, it was worth it!   I'm sure I will be back before too long.

Ikea is DEEP!  Deep, as far as way the fuck away from where I live in Surprise! I was at Ted's Hot Dogs though, and decided to come check it out since it was only another 10 minute drive.  We needed a few things and I was interested to see what the Phoenix Ikea was all about.  I was a bit surprised to find out that this was the only Ikea in the Phoenix area.  You would figure that the 7th largest city in America would have at least 2 of them?  Nope...just this one way down the 10!  I went here a little after 12 noon on a Friday.  It was crowded but there was still room to walk and maneuver.  I guarantee the weekends are horrid and packed with bad shopping cart pushers!  As far as my purchases, I got 2 cheap door mats ($1.89 each), Two 6 packs of spoons ($6.00 each), 6 bowls ($3.99 each), 10 glasses/cups ($.98 each), a colander ($3.00), and 2 throw blankets for our couches ($12.99 each).  I was pretty impressed with the quality of items and the total cost for everything.    Ikea is fine by me!  I have purchased items from there in the past and most of them have held up reasonably well.  I just wish that it was a bit closer so I could come here more often.

This was one of the last bookmarked pizza places in Phoenix left on my list.  My buddies had left back to Vegas, and I had an afternoon to myself.  I figured that it would be a perfect time to drive down here and try it out.  I had studied their menu previously, and there was one pizza that stood out above all the rest......The Rocket Man.  I am pretty much allergic to vegetables, but if you throw them on some dough, and bake it, I am down to eat my veggies!  The Rocket Man sounded delicious.  I knew for sure that I was going to get that.  I called in my order and arrived just a few minutes before it was ready.  I found a 25 minute parking spot out front and walked inside.  I paid for my pizza and also ordered a Sea Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie.  I took a seat and a few minutes later, my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was......................  Rocket Man Pizza ($14.00) -  I had done my research before, and I knew this was going to be a winner.  This pizza comes topped with spicy red Fresno chiles, broccolini, roasted orange peppers, roasted garlic and sun dried tomatoes.  These toppings are laid upon a super thin sourdough crust.  Side rant.....  Sourdough is my favorite bread.  You could give me some sourdough bread and butter as my last meal, and I would be content and die a happy man.  LGO's sourdough pizza crust is beyond amazing!  The thinness of the crust and the excellent chew and flavor make this one of the best crusts I have ever had.  It was like eating flat sourdough rolls topped with pizza goodies.  Here is why I know it is was so good...... I was still full from lunch when I picked up my pizza.  I sampled 2 small slices right when I got in my car and could have probably polished off the pizza.  This pizza was on point.  One of the best in Phoenix.  Instantly catapulted into my top 3 in the Valley.  The toppings were plentiful, colorful and delicious. All those veggies made the pizza sing!  The "spicy" Fresno chiles weren't really spicy at all..still very tasty though.  The peppers, tomatoes, broccolini and garlic were a flavor explosion and added great texture to the pizza, too.  I'm usually not the "veggie pizza" type person, but this thing breaks down all stereotypes and preconceived notions on what a veggie pizza should taste like.  I'm still thinking about it.  I took the rest of the pizza home and had 2 slices cold later in the evening.  Still just as good.  That sourdough crust is something else!  A few hours later, I reheated the pizza in the oven for a little bit so that the cheese would melt again and the crust would warm up.  Once again, amazing flavors and still just as good as freshly made.  You know its good when you eat it A. Fresh, B. Cold and C. Reheated.  Each and every occurrence was delicious!  I can preach how good the sourdough crust is until the cows come home.  You just have to go and try it yourself.  As long as you like sourdough bread, I guarantee you will be impressed and instantly fall in love with it!  Sea Salted Chocolate Chip Cookie ($3.00) -  I had read about these cookies in all of the Yelp reviews.  I saw them sitting there in the case and knew I had to get one.  $3.00 a cookie seems a bit steep, but these cookies are HUGE and totally worth the  money.  The cookies had a little crunch on the outside and were pretty soft on the inside.  The chocolate wasn't totally melted, but the chocolate chips were soft and easy to chew on.  The salt on top really put this over the top.  You got salty, sweet and savory all in one bite.  These things could become very addictive!  I wish I had ordered a few more of them.  Service was friendly enough.  The store is pretty "hip" too.  I was lucky to find parking in the lot (It was about 4pm in the afternoon) and didn't have to wait long for my food to be ready.  I really cannot wait until I come back to eat some more of that sourdough crust.  You could throw some dog shit on top of that crust, and it would still taste good!  Yup...I said it.  Possibly the best pizza crust I have ever had...anywhere....and I have eaten lots and lots of pizza around the country.  Come and try it for yourself!

The spaceship in the desert!  Yep thats what it is.  Huge area around the stadium.  We had a parking pass for the Brown lot which is in BFE.  Probably a mile or 2 from the actual stadium.  They do have school busses that take you near the stadium which is cool though.  You can pretty much tailgate and drink beers anywhere so that was nice.  Now for the real reason to go here..................some NFL FOOTBALL!!!!!  I am a huge Giants fan so my lady and my buddy Jon went out here to catch the game.  We had prime seats near the corner end zone which were perfect!  Giants kicked some ass as usual and won by 8 points.  The stadium itself is really big and they had the roof closed so it was super loud.  Typical stadium prices....$6 nachos, $4 hot dogs, $7 beers etc.  The layout sure does get congested though.  Walking around the stadium there always seemed to be logjams or people just hanging out getting in the way.  Restrooms were plentiful and there was never too long of a line to take a leak.  Overall a nice, new stadium which was cool to watch a game at.  The drive home to SD was made alot easier because the Giants won.....thats right suckas.....they are about to be repeat Super Bowl Champs!  They are 2-0 in this stadium :-).

Sometimes you just need a Green Chile Double.    Ever since moving to Phoenix, I have discovered the power of Whataburger.  It kind of grows on you.  The first couple times there, it was good but I was not overly impressed.  But, the more you come, the better it gets and the more you appreciate it.  It is now my go to fast food burger joint.  This Whataburger is a quick drive down from where I work (5 minutes).  The drive through is pretty speedy but I have received food that seemed like it could be more fresh...mostly the fries, a bit underdone sometimes and once or twice the burger buns seemed soggy and "rushed".  I usually don't choose that option anymore.  When you go inside, its a whole other story.  Their workers are extremely friendly and its always the same 2 older ladies that help you out.  They are very personable and provide excellent customer service.  The last few times here, I have gotten the Green Chile Double meal.  It's a huge double patty burger topped with both American and Monterey Jack cheese and green chiles.  That's it!  Simple and to the point. They cook the meat fresh when you order it and they also butter their buns.  I usually upsize the fries to large because they are pretty darn good.  They always salt them perfectly.  One of the best things about Whataburger is their option to have Spicy Ketchup.  Its ketchup hooked up with red jalapenos.  It's not burn your mouth hot, but it does provide a nice little zing to your tastebuds.  The stuff is addictive.  I've even threw some in my pocket to take home and eat with my burgers I make at home.  It's really tasty.  The only thing here that I have not been impressed with is their onion rings.  The breading is too "puffy" and the onions fell apart easily.  Not horrible, but their fries are way better and I wouldn't get the onion rings again.  I've had their breakfast a few times...only the Honey Butter Biscuit.  Fresh biscuit, chicken strip and honey butter.  It is freaking delicious!  Reason alone to stop.  Whataburger is really growing on me and I'm glad there are a few of them in AZ.  California could use some of these!

The view alone is worth a million bucks!  I wanted to take my wife somewhere nice, and somewhere we have never been before so I decided on taking her here for lunch.  It was a perfect date!  I made some reservations on Opentable.com for 12:30.  We got there early and it wasn't that busy so they told us to head on up.  To get there is a mission in itself.  You are lead over to a metal detector where a security guard asks you to empty out your pockets etc.   You are then led to the elevator and you get in. Up to floor 106!   You exit the elevator and then are greeted by the hostess and led to your table.  You cant even put into words what the view is like.  You are almost 900 feet up, in a revolving restaurant and you can see for what seems like an infinite distance!  Its a sight to see and if you are in Vegas, you have to come here at least one time...you will be glad you did! The restaurant rotates very slow.  It takes an hour and twenty minutes to make a full 360 so if you take your time eating lunch, you can see all of Las Vegas.  Its such an amazing sight to see.  Words cant describe it.   As far as the food...........  For an appetizer, I ordered the flash fried calamari.  I rarely get to eat calamari and wanted to try theirs out.  It comes with 2 different sauces, a wasabi white sauce and a tomato sauce.  I liked the tomato one better.  I ate all of it because the wife doesn't like seafood and it was an excellent starter.  They also give you some cibatta bread with regular butter and a chili butter.  Good stuff!   For our entrees, I went with the burger and got it topped with the horseradish crust and fried onion strings.  It came with french fries too.  The burger was cooked perfectly medium and was tasty as can be.  The wife ordered their pesto pasta with chicken.  She let me have some and it was really good too.  The service was spot on, very attentive.  Total bill after tip was about $65 for lunch which seems like a lot, but once you get up to that restaurant and sit down, its totally worth the money!    Added bonus, you can go up to the top floor and go outside on the deck after you are done.  If you want to go up there by itself, I think it was either $14 or $16 per person so getting lunch for only $30 bucks more is a bargain in itself.   It was a great experience and I will definitely come back and recommend this to everyone I know!

As good as the original ones in Hawaii?  Close but no cigar....Hawaii wins by a nose.  Comparable?  Hell yes!  Half the price?  Affirmative!  $4.50 for a 2 scoop hot fudge sundae.  I got a scoop of white chocolate macadamia nut and a scoop of chocolate macadamia nut.  The lady dishing out the ice cream was super friendly and hooked it up!   These were baseball sized scoops.  She topped it off with a grip of hot fudge, some macadamia nuts, whipped cream and cherries!   An awesome sundae!   This guy in front of me got a banana split.  3 scoops topped with everything under the sun!  It could feed a small army.  It looked tasty!  Lapperts is flat out delicious and I would highly recommend coming here if you are near downtown Vegas!

Dear Lapperts,                          I was in Las Vegas this past week and decided to stop into your store in the California because you have delicious ice cream and I crave it all the time.  On my two trips to your store, I left completely satisfied except for one little thing.  What the hell happened to topping off your sundaes with macadamia nuts?  You now use chopped up walnuts?  Come on now!  I know macadamia nuts cost a little more.... thats fine, charge us, the customer, a little more.  I would be glad to pay an extra 25 or 50 cents per sundae to get macadamia nuts instead of walnuts.  On all other fronts you are doing awesome.  Your staff is friendly, your prices are fine and your macadamia nut, chocolate macadamia nut and cookie crunch ice creams are amazing!   Keep up the good work but bring back those macadamia nuts as a topping!  They make people smile!  Love,          Tim

I cant believe I have not written a review on this joint even though I have been here a half a dozen times or so!  This place is awesome!  If you want a great deli sandwich in Vegas, come here.  Its expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for!  I always order the Canters Delight.  Its like a club sandwich minus all the vegetables.  Its a triple decker sandwich stacked with ham, turkey, pastrami, corned beef and cheese.  It is easily in my top 5 favorite sandwiches in the world.  The thing is gigantic so you better come hungry.  You have to kind of contemplate how to navigate this bad boy for a minute or so.  I always grab my knife and load it up with mustard, then spread a little on the corner of the sandwich and then dig in.  Every single bite is amazing.  The rye bread is soft, delicious and has a good crust, the meats are plentiful, juicy and piled high, the cheese is tasty.  Its pretty much damn near a perfect sandwich.   My wife always orders the BLT on rye and that always comes out fantastic too.  They must use 10-12 slices of bacon on this monster.  We always come hungry and leave stuffed to the brim with smiles on our faces.  Its amazing what a great sandwich can do for the soul ;-).

My buddies from Vegas came out for some Spring Training action.  We hit up 2 games here on a Thursday and Friday.  The stadium is super easy to get to (Right off Bell and 83rd) and the prices for tickets seemed pretty fair.  We got lawn seats each day ($5.00 in advance, $7.00 day of game) and had a fun time walking around the stadium.  We posted up on the blue picnic benches out behind right field.  Gave us a chance to sit down and relax for a bit .  Prices for concessions are average...aka...pricey!  Parking is normally $5.00, but both times we went, there was no attendant there so we parked for free.  We also did show up after the game had officially started too...maybe an insider tip? lol.  Anyways....overall it was an older but nice stadium.  Workers were friendly and the price of tickets was definitely reasonable.  I know I will be back sometime soon!  Still have to show some love to my old home town of San Diego.  Go Padres (Only when they aren't playing my Cardinals)!

I am sad to admit that in my 32 years on this earth, I had never had Gelato until tonight.  It was one of the greatest things I have ever put in my mouth!  The wife and I ate dinner at Grimaldis and had to walk off some pizza so we headed up Scottsdale Blvd and saw this on our left.  I had to stop.    I got 2 flavors....chocolate and almond snickers.  The almond snickers was awesome with just enough nuts and caramel twist etc.  Now the plain chocolate gelato....this my friends was freaking AMAZING!  It was so light and creamy.  The taste reminded me of eating a chocolate cake...the best chocolate cake ever....and this was in gelato form.  It was a little over 5 bucks for 2 scoops.  I like how they give you a dinky little "shovel" to eat your gelato.  Makes your brain think you are eating way more because its in such small doses on the tiny spoon.    I didnt know what I was missing out on all these years never having  tried gelato.  I plan on going back here at least twice more over the next 3 days I have left in AZ.  It was awesome!

One of the best movie theaters I have been to in a long long time.  When its 115 degrees outside, nothing beats sitting in an air conditioned theater.  My buddy and I went here twice during our stay.  We saw Inception and Cyrus.  Both decent flicks by the way.  5 stars.  That's right!  Know why?  $5.25 to get in.  That is unheard of.  I worked at a movie theater back in the day and those were the matinee prices THEN.  Here they are still that cheap.  That is awesome!   The theaters were really nice and they had multi levels in them.  We sat in the middle level for both movies.  There is nothing in front of you so you can stretch out your legs if you want.  The seats were comfortable and everyone we encountered was nice and friendly.  They also validate parking too which is awesome!  Overall a great theater!

Decided to come here for lunch today...back on the low carb kick so I went with some lettuce wrapped Double Doubles.  They really do hook up the lettuce here in the lettuce wrap.  These burgers had like 6 extra lettuce leaves wrapped around them.  I just discarded them to the side and chowed down.  The burgers were great as always.  Hot, fresh, inexpensive and delicious.  Service was friendly although a little weird.  The girl at the register wouldn't really look me in the face.  She kept peering over my shoulder like she was talking with the person behind me (even though there was nobody behind me).  Can she see ghosts?  Fucking rad if she can!  It wasn't a lazy eye either.  It was just a bit odd.  At least she got my semi unorthodox order correct the first time (lettuce wrap, no tomato, no spread, both kinds of onions).  This place is 1 mile from work so I'm sure I will be back.  Can't really beat In N Out!

So....we purchased a new house and we needed a U-Haul to move all our stuff.  Thank goodness we were only moving a block or two away from where we used to live.  Multiple smaller trips would be in order.  I picked up a 15 foot truck for a 24 hour period.  Cost was $29.99 and then .89 cents a mile I believe.  Total cost out the door including $11.00 in gas that I had to put in, was around $72.00.  Not bad...not bad at all.  Service was very friendly and pick up and return was seamless.  I will definitely use this particular U-Haul again when the right situation presents itself.

Today was my sons 1st birthday.  My wife wanted to take him down towards the mall so we could go to Toys R Us as well as a couple of other stops within the mall.  We decided to have lunch here at Johnny Rockets.  It was my first time eating at this establishment and I came away mostly impressed.  Back story has it that Johnny Rockets was modeled after The Apple Pan.  Apple Pan is pretty delicious and I have been to it a few times in LA.  If Johnny Rockets could come close to Apple Pan, I would be happy.  For the most part it did.  Here is what we ordered....................  I went with a Smoke House Double, my wife went with The Original, we split 1/2 rings & 1/2 fries and had water and a root beer to drink.  Here is how everything tasted.............  Smoke House Double-  This burger was large and in charge!  It is a double patty (1/3lb patties) burger topped with cheese, bacon, onion rings and bbq/ranch sauce.  This is served on a nice soft bun. Kind of like a Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  The patties were juicy and cooked fresh.  The onion rings were a good addition and gave it a little crunch.  The bacon was plentiful and tasty and the cheese was melted perfectly.  The only thing I did not really care for was the bbq/ranch sauce.  I could barely detect it and didn't really add anything to the burger.  Maybe made it a bit more moist?  Maybe?  I could have done without it or gone with just straight bbq sauce instead...and way more than what they put on here.  Overall it was a hefty solid burger though and I would get it again.  The Original-  My wife really liked it.  I didn't get a bite of it, but it looked good.  1/2 Fries & 1/2 Rings-  This was a good way to sample both their side items.  The fries and rings were kind of plain jane though.  Tasty enough, but not really great.  I would probably pick the onion rings next time over the fries since the onion rings tasted better and were more crunchy and solid than the fries.  Service was good for the most part.  We had a server from San Diego which was cool...we chatted it up about SD for a minute or so.  The place was a little busy though and I think he was swamped.  We didn't get a refill on our drink until he brought our check over.  He did give us a drink in a to go cup though which made up for the lack of refill earlier.  Total for everything including tip was around $26.00.  Not super cheap but not incredibly expensive either...I thought the price was fair for the food we got.    Overall its probably 3 stars for the food itself but an extra star for the vibe of the place (cool 50's style, great oldies music, comfortable booths etc), the friendly service and the good time that we had!  I would come back...not sure how soon, and I don't think I would come down here intentionally to come here but if I was close by and hungry, I wouldn't hesitate to come back!

What could  have been...................  I took my car to get serviced this morning and then I was going to head to a different pizza place.  Turns out, they don't open until 4pm during the week.  Rats!  Change of plans, stat!  I had remembered seeing this restaurant being mentioned in the "Best Pizza in Phoenix" category somewhere.  They had this concoction of mythological proportions called "The Vesuvio".  This thing was half pizza, half calzone.  I knew at some point I had to try it out.  Today was that day.  I drove down here from Surprise, parked near the Bashas and walked on over.  Cool little location and neighborhood btw.  I was greeted by a friendly host and told to sit wherever I wanted.  I chose a table kind of near the pizza oven area.  I ordered water to drink and then already knew what I was getting.......The Vesuvio!  I placed my order for that, sipped on my water and then about 10 minutes later my order was delivered to my table.  Here is how it was............  The Vesuvio ($16.00) - Right when this was delivered to my table, I knew it wasn't going to be amazing like I had hoped.  It was decent in size but there were some obvious issues with it.  First of all, the crust was really white.  They probably used too much flour to dust it and/or didn't bake it long enough at a high enough temperature.  There were no charred bits anywhere to be found.  The bottom of the crust was barely dark either.  The only dark down there was from some of the dust from the bottom of the oven it was baked in.  I decided to cut open the calzone side first.  This thing had cheese, ham and salami.  About that.....  The ham was cubed up little pieces.  While plentiful, it just didn't work for this calzone.  It would have been better with slices of ham.  The little cubes of ham just fell all over the place and were a pain in the ass to pick up with my fork to try and eat.  The salami they use seemed really pale and it was not piping hot like it should have been.  Hell, even the cheese was not totally melted all the way.  All of that paired with the soft, underdone dough was disappointing.  Next up, I tried the pizza side of things.  This was better but still not anywhere close to good.  The cheese was at least melted, there were plenty of mushrooms and the sauce was decent.  Once again though, on top of that dough, it wasn't even close to being "good".  Did I eat the whole thing?  Yup.  The food was definitely edible and it wasn't disgusting or anything like that.  I was just disappointed is all.  I had such high hopes and was totally let down.  The fact that I dropped an Andrew Jackson made my wallet frown too.  Would I ever come back?  Nope!  There are way too many other excellent pizza places in Phoenix that know how to cook a proper pizza.  The Vesuvio is one hell of an idea and if some other great pizzeria decided to make it, I guarantee it would be off the wall amazing!  Just turns out that the one place that does make it, Grazie, falls short.  Sad but true.

Never really seen a Papa Murphy's before moving to Surprise.  There were a few in San Diego, but none real close to my house, and I never really had a desire to try them out.  I've been here for 2 years and still never made it to this one here in Surprise.  My buddy Kevin just moved to town, and asked me if I had ever been.  This place is right up the street from his new house, and they have a flyer out that advertises "Any Large Pizza for $10.00 on Tuesdays".  Sounded like a good deal, and it planted a seed in my brain.  I needed to try this joint out.  Always wanted to, not sure why I never did.  Tonight was the night.  Drove down, parked, and walked inside.  When I got in there, 3 people greeted me right away and were very eager to help me out.  I told them that I had never been to a Papa Murphy's before and they all smiled and looked at each other.  It was a little bit awkward, but they were super friendly after that first initial interaction.  The guy explained how everything worked, all the sizes, costs etc.  I decided to do a create my own pizza on their original crust.  I went with red sauce, pepperoni and garlic (our usual go to order at most pizza places).  You pay, they make your pizza, explain how to cook it,  and you are out the door in less than 5 minutes.  Here is how it was..........  Large Pepperoni and Garlic Pizza-  Their are instructions included in the pizza.  The pizza comes on this giant paper plate looking thing.  The instructions are to bake it on the paper tray, for about 10 minutes, then check on it every 2 minutes after that.  For a "crisp crust" they recommend you take it off the paper plate and put it directly on the oven rack after 10 minutes.  We did that, but I would recommend removing that paper plate maybe 5 minutes in and have it cook directly on the oven rack for the remaining 12-15 minutes.  The only complaint about this pizza was that the bottom dough was just a tad underdone once the cheese and crust on top were ready.  Do that trick, and you are in for a treat!    I am usually a pizza snob, and only like certain types of pizza from certain places.  I tend to eat at the same spots over and over once I find something good.  I took a bite into this pizza, and was incredibly surprised at how good it was!  It reminded me of my own home made pizzas that I do, but theirs was a little bit better!  The cheese melted perfectly, the pepperonis were nice and crisp as well as a little spicy, there was plenty of chopped garlic, and the sauce was very tasty, too!  The crust wasn't the most flavorful, and that bottom was just a tad underdone, but for the most part, this pizza was really good.  Way better than any chain like Pizza Hut, Little Ceasars, Papa Johns, Dominos etc.  I would choose to pick up a pizza here over those other places 99 out of 100 times!  Think of it as a little more expensive frozen pizza you can get at the store, but 1,000,000 times tastier.  It was a mighty fine pizza.  I was impressed!    Overall, I was surprised at how much I liked it!  It's super quick, inexpensive (Especially on Tuesdays...any Large Pizza is only $10.00) and pretty darn tasty after all is said and done.  The employees were nice, they have deals online, twitter etc. and it's pretty close to the house.  Can't wait to try out their other pizzas.  If they are as close to as good as the one I had tonight, I will be happy and continue to come back!

4 stars.  One of the best theaters I have ever been to.  It wasnt too crowded, it had super comfortable seats that RECLINE, and they also show  DLP movies so they are super crisp/sharp.  Overall a great theater!  Staff was friendly and the layout of the theater was great.  Damn near a perfect movie theater.

Came back today to try this place out again.  Was craving some chips and tortillas so I came down.  Unfortunately, it will probably be my last time :-(.  I appreciate the follow up comment by the manager, but this place just isn't for me.    I ordered a chicken adobada taco and a regular grilled chicken taco.  That, a small drink and 3 corn tortillas was almost $12 bucks!  That is one reason I won't be coming back.  Its way way way too expensive for what you get.  The chicken was decent.  The adobada was pretty flavorful and the grilled chicken was alright.  Skimp though.  $3.39 for ONE taco.  The flour tortillas were good.  Not as good as last time but still homemade and good.  My side order of corn tortillas were just ok.  Free chips and fixings were decent.  The place was pretty much empty yet it still took a good 10 minutes for my food to come out.  Meh....not the worst meal ever but far from great and nothing from this visit improved upon my first time there.  I highly doubt I will be back.

Fry's is super solid!  This location is like a mile from my house..maybe less? I could definitely walk there if need be.   I love this store!  They have everything you could imagine.  Bag of chips?  Yup.  Batteries?  Yup.  New kitchen table?  Yup. Pots and Pans?  Yup.  New bath towels? Yup.  Chase bank inside the store?  Yup. Drive thru pharmacy?  Yup.  Great ice cream selection (Blue Bell, Blue Bunny, Turkey Hill, Ben and Jerry's etc)?  Yup. Fantastic chicken tenders from the deli counter?  Yup.   Gas Station out front which currently has unleaded for $1.99 a gallon?  Yup!   This place has EVERYTHING!  I can't think of a bad thing to say about Fry's.  I am glad it is close by and I much prefer this store over Albertsons and Safeway!  Even if I lived far away, I would still drive here to this Fry's.  I like it the best out of all other Phoenix Fry's that I have been to.

Stayed here Thursday and Friday night.  Priceline purchase for $29 a night, after taxes and fees, it was $72.00 for both nights.  Not a bad price, but after staying here 2 nights, I know why it was so cheap!    First of all, this place is the "Ramada".  I used my GPS and found this location but there was a big huge sign out front that said "Days Hotel".  I drove by a few times thinking that my GPS was wrong or that the "Ramada" was behind this hotel or something.  Nope....turns out this is the right place.  No Ramada sign ANYWHERE indicating this is the right place.  Room was meh.  Not the worst hotel I ever stayed in, but pretty close.  The door was hard to open and the security bolt latch was missing.  The carpet, curtains, bed, sheets, furniture etc was all pretty worn in. The TV was ok...28/30 inch LG.   The AC would constantly kick on and off every minute too instead of either just staying on or maintaining the temp.  Kind of annoying but I got used to it.  The bathroom was ok...small ass shabby towels though and the toilet was "iffy".  Better not drop a large duece or you might have trouble flushing!   The shower was actually good....had great water pressure and tons of hot water.  No vent fan though which got things hot and steamy!  The price was good...that's about it.  I would not stay here again unless I was in need of a super bargain and this was the last hotel available.  The front counter ladies were nice on both check in and check out.  The hotel is just too damn old and shotty though.

A little backstory first.............  We had a team meeting at work a few months back, and I was in charge of the "ice breaker" question that would begin the meeting.  My question was, "If you were moving out of Phoenix, and could eat just one last meal in town, where would it be?  A couple of different people said "Carolina's".  I am pretty picky when it comes to my Mexican food, and so far in Phoenix, I have only found a few spots that I consider "good".  If about 1/4 of our team claimed that Carolina's would be their last meal, that was a sign for me to check it out.  I finally made it down here today, for lunch.  Hell of a recommendation!  I was talking with my friend at work, Kelly, about what she usually gets (she was one of the people that had stated Caolina's would be her last meal in Phoenix) when she comes here.  She said she was a big fan of their shredded beef tacos.  I knew that was the first thing that I was going to try here at Carolina's.  I jumped in my car, drove down the 17, exited on Cactus Rd and pulled up to the joint.  I walked inside, ordered 2 shredded beef tacos, one chicken flauta, and a glass of water.  My total was just under $7.00.  I grabbed my receipt, my cup of water and headed over to the salsa pumps (pump action, like a ketchup dispenser) to fill up a couple of plastic containers.  A few minutes later, my food was ready.  Here is how everything was.................  Beef Taco-  These things come individually wrapped in white paper.  You could see a little bit of sheen/grease through the wrapper which is an ok sign by me.  I unwrapped my first one, and was immediately impressed.  The shell was perfectly fried, the meat was hot and stringy, the lettuce crisp and cool, and the cheese...oh, the cheese...the cheese was extremely plentiful and absolutely fantastic.  They use a chopped/shredded style cheese that almost reminded me of a parmesan cheese in a can almost (the cut/shred of it).  There was a ton of it and it tasted fantastic!  I would recommend grabbing a fork to scoop up all the cheese that will fall onto your paper plate/wrapper.  Scoop it up and redistribute it back onto your taco!  I added some of their thin hot sauce to the mix and the flavors complimented each other perfectly.  My favorite beef taco of all time is Tito's in Culver City.  These tacos here at Carolina's were the closest thing to Tito's I have ever tasted. They were fantastic and are definitely some of the best beef tacos I have ever had (top 3, easily!)  I mowed down my 2 tacos and could have had about 3 to 4 more.  For $2.25 a pop, these are cheap, filling, and absolutely awesome!  Reason enough to return here over and over again.  Chicken Flauta-  I ordered one of these a la carte just to see what the chicken tasted like.  The flauta comes in a box with lettuce and a ton of their shredded cheese.  The flauta was good.  It was a little bit small though and wasn't mind blowing.  The shell was crunchy, and the chicken tasted fine.  Dipped in their hot sauce, it was tasty.  Not sure I would get one again though...pay the extra $.75 and get yourself a taco instead.   Service was quick and friendly, and prices were great!  I can see why there are so many Carolina's fans here in Phoenix!  Those shredded beef tacos were easily 5 stars.  I hear their chimichangas are great, and I hope to try those sometime soon.  Until then though, I will be thinking about those shredded beef tacos!

I am one step closer to completing my goal.  I want to visit every Grimaldis in the US before I die.  After tonights visit to this one, I have most of AZ taken care of.  We decided to come here because we had never been to this one.  We arrived and were seated right away.  Surprisingly this one wasn't crowded at all and that was fine by us.    We got a small caesar salad, a small pepperoni and garlic, and a personal white pizza with roasted red peppers.  A few minutes later we got our salad.  It was really good.  Just enough dressing, lots of cheese and croutons.  It was a good starter.  A few minutes after that, our pizza came out.  If you have read my other reviews, you will know that I think Grimaldis is the best.....this pizza was no different.  I really liked the white with roasted red peppers.  Everything was delicious and even though there was some doubt we could finish off 2 pizzas, I turned on my inner fat boy, and finished off all the pizza.  It was tough, but someone had to do it....little kids are starving in Africa somewhere....lll be damned if I'm going to waste some slices of this amazing pizza.  Down the hatch it went....my stomach doesn't like me right now because its so full, but he will forgive me once he doesn't get any of this delicatessen back in San Diego LOL.

We came here twice on our trip to AZ.  The first time here we got a small Cesar salad and a large pepperoni and garlic pizza.  The salad was awesome!  The lettuce was crisp as could be and they don't soak it with dressing.  Just a light coating.  Very crisp and fresh tasting!   The pizza on the other hand was lacking a little bit.  The pepperonis were not as well done as the past and the crust was even a tad gummy towards the middle.  Even the tomato sauce tasted a little different than what I had remembered.  The meal was still good but not amazing like usual.    Fast forward to lunch today.................  Some Grimaldis locations have lunch specials.  If you are near one that does, please come and eat here asap.  They have killer deals.  Both my wife and I got their lunch special.  It came with a personal (6 inch) pizza or personal calzone, a Cesar salad and a drink for $8.49.  My wife ordered a pepperoni and garlic pizza and I went with a meatball calzone as my entree.  We also ordered an extra personal pepperoni pizza which was $3.99 I believe.  Here is how the food stacked up..................  Meatball calzone-  We have a winner!  I have never ordered a calzone from Grimaldis mainly because the pizza is always so good.  I went off track today and decided to try one out.  It was awesome!  They stuff this thing with mozzarella, meatballs and ricotta.  They serve it with sauce on the side.  I will not hesitate to get this again.  The crust was nicely charred but still really chewy.  The meatballs were moist and delicious and the cheese blend was creamy and sinful!  I really enjoyed this thing!  Pizzas-  The pizzas were awesome too.  Since they are smaller, they cook them real quick.  The pepperoni was better today and there were no soggy bits anywhere.  The sauce still tasted a little different but it was still good.  Grimaldis crust is my favorite.  Coal fired ovens sure do put out good pizza!  Service is always excellent at this location plus its never crowded (At least when we have been).  Its our favorite Grimaldis in AZ and we will definitely be back next time we are in town.  Total for everything with tip was under $30.00.  That my friends is a great lunch!

I love video games and we had a D&B card that we purchased in Hawaii while on our honeymoon.  We decided to see how much was left on the card and kill some time this afternoon.  Turns out we had like 20 bucks left on it so we played a bunch of games.  We played some racing games, some skeeball, some basketball, air hockey etc.  They even have this virtual reality ride/game thing.  2 people sit in these reclining chairs, you pay your money, then you get to pick 6 scenarios to "play".  We chose the spooky mine ride and some car racer game.  Basically you sit back and watch this screen in front of you, all the while your chair moves, fans blow on you to simulate wind etc.  It was pretty cool.  It kind of jerked you around in some parts though and my head was banging against the headrest.  I didnt like that aspect of it but other than that it was fine.   Oh yeah....I played a shitload of The Claw games....I am pretty good at them and love playing them.  I got 3 bears in uniform...Red Sox, Phillies and Cavs, as well as a bowling pin looking animal for my dog Chief to play with when we get back.  It was a solid Dave and Busters and we had fun while we were there.

We were planning on going to another pizza establishment, but there was a line and we didn't feel like waiting.  My father in law took me to a Peter Piper a few years ago, and surprisingly, it was decent!  I had seen this place a few times, as well as the one closer to my house in Surprise.  I remembered that they had a decent priced lunch buffet, so we decided to stop in for some grub.  First off, this Peter Piper is HUGE!  Never seen one as big in my life.  They were super busy, yet there were still tons of open places to sit and room to merge.  We decided to go with the weekday lunch buffet.  The buffet  was $6.49 and kids under 3 eat for free.  It was only $16.50 for all 3 of us to eat including one soda.  Not bad, not bad at all.    The lunch buffet had a lot of different options.  Because they were so busy, fresh pizzas were coming out left and right.  At any given time, they had at least 10 pizzas to choose from.  They also had cheesy bread, garlic knots/rolls, a salad (didn't try any of it) as well as 2 different kinds of dessert pizza.  The pizza is not "gourmet" or anything like that, but it was surprisingly good and especially good for only $6.49.  It was way better than somewhere like Little Ceasars, Pizza Hut, Dominos etc.  It almost reminded me of the pizza I make at home.  Pretty thin crust, not too much sauce, and lots of cheese.  The best thing at the buffet had to have been the garlic knots.  These are little thumb sized balls of dough, coated in garlic oil and salt.  The outer crust of these things had a bunch of tiny bubbles on them and that provided great texture and a really good crunch while biting into them.  I was impressed!  The dessert pizzas were pretty good, too!  They had an apple cinnamon one and a strawberry type one.  The apple cinnamon was the better of the 2.  The strawberry one was a bit too sweet.  After we were done eating, we dropped a couple of bucks at the arcade type thing they have.  This part of the restaurant was actually a bit small.  They could use some extra space of the dining area to maybe expand the games?  They only had like 2 "rides" for little kids and one of them was broken.  Most of the games were ticket type games.  They did have one claw machine with those rubber spiky balls in them.  I won 2 of them for my son, Bill.    Overall, I liked it better than I probably should have.  If I'm going out for pizza and want to spend some decent money, Peter Piper is nowhere in the equation.  If I want a cheap, fast, and unlimited buffet, Peter Piper is my place!  I can definitely see having a birthday party here or just coming back during the week on one of my days off when I don't want to drop $15.00 on a "good pizza".  The price can't be beat and the quality is not bad...even for a pizza snob like myself ;-).

So....I had a half day at work, and decided to go catch a movie down here.  This theater is pretty darn big.  Takes up almost a whole block downtown.  I had to drive around for a bit to find parking, but there is a huge garage nearby which I finally found.  Be sure to bring your ticket with you to get it validated...free parking!    This place was a ghost town!  The huge ticket office outside was completely closed, so you had to buy your ticket from a lone cashier inside the front doors.  There was nobody there, so there was no line or anything, but there was also no list of movies or showtimes anywhere visible.  I knew what time my movie was at and what I wanted to see so I was fine.  If you were just randomly walking by though, and didn't know what movie you wanted to watch, I could foresee a lot of questions being asked to find out what movies were playing and what times they started at. I only saw 4 employees the whole time there!  One guy selling tickets, one lady at the snack bar and 2 guys walking around the hallways.   Anyways...........  Seats were comfy, screen and sound were great!  The best part....the price!  $5.40 for a matinee ticket before 4pm.  I used to work in a movie theater back in the late 90s and our matinee prices back then were $4.25.  So almost 20 years later, its only a dollar more.  Can't beat that price at all!    I don't know how often I am going to be back down in this area to watch a movie again, but if I am nearby and need a theater to catch a flick at, this will be the one!   It was super chill, comfy and affordable!

Pretty solid Fry's.   This is the closest one to my work.  I come here occasionally, mostly to get their chicken strips.  They sure are delicious!  $6.99 a pound and there are always great.  Can't think of a better place to get chicken strips that are this high quality for that low of a price.  Never had a bad batch yet.    Random things about this store................  -Solar powered/shaded parking lot is nice. -Decent claw game but they don't replace items too often. -Security guard always at the door.  I have been here 2 times where I have seen someone either complete/attempt to do a mad dash.  One guy got out the door, hopped in his car and sped away. The other guy got caught.  This dude straight up had a shopping cart full of stuff, including an expensive vacuum, and just tried to rush the door lol.  Security grabbed his cart and he ran out the door and escaped.  Pretty brazen though.  I can see why too....there are tons of homeless and sketchy looking folks around Bell and 27th.  Anyways...........  I will continue to come back because it is near work and its convenient. The selection is not as big and the store is not as nice as the one by my house in Surprise, but it is still pretty good and better than other stores in the area.

Ice cream is by far my favorite dessert.  I could eat it everyday after every meal.  When you put a place right next door to my favorite pizza joint, BINGO!  I think you have found perfection!  After I ate my pizza at Grimaldis I walked next door to get a frozen custard.  I chose vanilla and got Oreos and pretzel pieces mixed into it.  A little sweet and salty combo.  It was delicious!  It was called a concrete.  Ted Drewes in St. Louis was the inventor of the concrete and Nielsens comes damn close to being an exact replica.  It was only 5 bucks and they give you a gigantic cup full.  I barely could finish it.    If you want to hit up 2 "best of" things in Vegas I would recommend dinner next door at Grimaldis and dessert at Nielsens.  In my opinion, it may be the best combo of eateries that are right next door to each other in the whole USA.

We have been here twice in two days.  Its a pretty nice theater.  Chairs are pretty comfy and you cannot beat the price.  During the day, movies are $7.00.  This is the weekend too so they may cost less during the week.  All the workers we encountered were friendly.  The popcorn was solid and that's about it.  A good theater!

Got this hotel on hotwire and it was only 60 bucks.  Cant beat that.  Its pretty close to the airport and right now they are doing a crapload of construction around the area so driving there and the roads werent the most friendly.  The room itself isnt bad.  We just got the room for a night before going to the Giants vs. Cardinals game Sunday.  Couch, 2 tvs, mini fridge were all nice.  Beds were pretty comfy and the shower had some good water pressure.  Nothing I could really complain about.  I would definitely stay here again for 60 bucks.

I've been eating so much pizza lately, I think I might turn into one!  My buddy Mike was telling me about this place and he said it was legit.  It's only a few minutes up the road from where I work so I decided I would pick up a pizza for lunch.  I called them up and ordered a 14 inch Cheese PIzza.  Drove up there, picked it up and then headed back to work.  My total was just under $12.00 for the pizza.  I devoured this thing in my car during my lunch break.  It was delicious...I ate the whole damn pizza!  This pizza had a good medium/thin crust, really good sauce, good cheese (tad greasy) and great overall flavor.  It reminded me of some mom and pop type shops back where I grew up at in LA.  I will definitely be back.  The staff was friendly and joked around with me for a bit while I was picking up my food.  Good times!

I stopped by here trying to get some bread to take home and make a sandwich with.  When I walked in, the only "bread" they had were bagels really.  This is more of a soup/sandwich/salad type casual restaurant.  Good to know!   I could not leave empty handed though.  I saw the display case full of cookies.  Buy 6, get 6 free?  Sure...lets do it!  I got 4 chocolate chip, 4 coconut chocolate chip and 4 peanut butter.  Just over $9.00.  These cookies were fantastic!  Nice and rich and buttery and loaded with toppings and nuts.  They are $1.45 each but the dozen deal is easily the way to go.  These pair well with a glass of milk.  I'm getting all my bad eating out of the way until my wife moves out.  I may have to stop here once more for these cookies.  They are heavenly!

Me, thinking in my head.................this is about 6:50pm btw.  "Dang, I really need to make a copy of this move in paperwork.  Let me Yelp Kinkos or places like it."   "Sweet, Office Max is only like 7 miles away.....AND they are open until 9pm!.  I'm going to get some copies and maybe fax a few things".   (See hours from their website posted below).  13722 West Bell Road Surprise, AZ 85374 Phone: (623) 584-6211 Hours: M-F: 8-9, Sat: 9-9, Sun: 10-7 Store #: 1205   Pull up to the store at around 7:06.  Walk up to the door and it doesn't open.  I see people inside though.  Look at the sign on the door.  They close at 7pm on Saturdays.   UPDATE YOUR FUCKING WEBSITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I hate that shit.  Totally wasted my time and because of that I will never ever step foot in this place.

What is better than having pizza for lunch?  Following it up with pizza for dinner!  I had this placed bookmarked and decided to try it out on the way home from work.  It's located in downtown historic Glendale which looked pretty cool.  I found parking around the corner on a side street and walked half a block to the restaurant.  I walked in, was seated, and placed my order.  I went with the Margherita D.O.C and a Diet Coke.  Here is how it was...................  Margherita D.O.C ($10.00) -  This is simple and straight to the point.  San Marzano Tomatoes, Olive Oil, House Made Mozzarella and some Fresh Basil.  So simple yet so delicious.  The pizza was perfect!  The tomatoes, fresh mozz and basil did wonders to my mouth.  The crust was nice and salty and chewy with a nice char on it.  It was foldable and everything held together well.  This is one of the times where I was damn close to ordering another pizza.  It was phenomenal and one of, if not the best Neapolitan pizzas I have ever had.  It was a pretty large "personal" pizza too and the price was right!  Diet Coke ($2.50)-  They serve Mexican Coke products here.  They bring you a bottle and a glass with ice.  It was refreshing.  No refills though since its sold by the bottle.  Service was fantastic!  The hostess, waitress and even owner? came by and asked how everything was.  It was pretty much a perfect meal!  I will be back in the near future!  Now that I think about it, I definitely should have ordered another one..........my mouth is watering just thinking about how great it was!  Fantastic pizza!

So...it's been awhile since I have written a review for this place.  I have been back probably a dozen times, and it's still my favorite Neapolitan style pizza in Phoenix.  My buddy was in from out of town, and I wanted to take him somewhere good.  I was also going to branch out and try something new.  I had been eyeing their Linguini with Clams in red sauce for awhile now and decided that I would order it during this most recent visit.  We drove down, parked, walked down the block and then made our way inside.  We were seated immediately and placed our order.  I went with an order of the Linguini and Clams in Red Sauce, my buddy went with the Chicken Marsala, and we split a Dolce Diavolo pizza.    Before we even get to the food, I would like to give some props to all the employees that work here.  I have always had great service, and they always remember who you are.  There is a guy named Sean (not sure on the spelling of his name) who is flat out awesome!  He is always very personable and we always shoot the shit for a few minutes whenever I am in there.  He recognizes me every time I come in and asks how I have been etc.  Great, great, great customer service!  All the other servers are great too.  Even had a chance to meet the owner, Justin, and we talked NY Giants football for a minute.  They have a great group of people working here!   On to the food................  Linguini and Clams in Red Sauce-  Like I said earlier, I had been eyeing this one for awhile now.  Problem is, their pizza is so damn good, I never branched out to try anything else.  I had my mind made up though, and knew I was going to get it.  I was glad I did!  This pasta dish comes loaded with clams!  It had whole clams as well as diced/chopped clams.  This was piled on top of perfectly cooked linguini and mixed with a delicious red sauce/broth.  It also came with 2 triangular pieces of bread.  Man...this dish was fantastic!  Portion size was huge, the clams were awesome, and the red sauce had a bit of spice to it.  It was probably the best pasta dish I have ever had at a restaurant.  Yes, it was that good!  The kicker, it was only $11.00.  That is a steal for this dish!  I'm sad I never ordered it sooner.  I will order this from here on out!  My buddy said he loved his chicken marsala, too!  He was very impressed.  Dolce Diavolo Pizza-  This is my go to pizza.  I either go with a plain Margherita, or this one, 90% of the time.  This pizza has sopressata, Calabrian chiles, mozzarella, basil and honey!  This pizza is fantastic!  The combo of flavors are absolutely awesome.  You get the spicy sopressata, the creamy mozzarella, the heat from the chiles and the sweet from the honey.  This is all laid upon a great crust.  A little bit salty, a little bit soft, and a great chew.  It's a very unique pizza and its incredibly delicious.  It is also the only place in the Valley that I have contemplated ordering a second pizza once I was finished with my first.  I can put down pizza like nobodies business, but am usually content when its gone. I have never actually ordered another one, but always think about it..and only here!  The pizza is that good!   I don't know if I could have asked for a better meal!  The pasta and pizza combo was insanely awesome!  Out the door with tip and everything, it was less than $25.00.  For that quality of food, friendly service, and huge portions, it's an incredible bargain.  I can't say enough great things about this place. You should definitely check it out!

First time here and I was impressed.  This is my hometown (Surprise, AZ) stadium where the Royals and Rangers play.  I came here with my wife, son and in laws to catch a Padres vs Royals game.  Free parking across the street.  Workers were friendly.  The grass in the outfield was well maintained and very comfortable to relax on (no shade though).  As others have said, concessions did seem a bit weak sauce but we did not eat at the game either (too expensive!).  We did get some sno cones which were delicious on this hot day.  $3.00 for a small, $5.00 for the large.  I like how the stadium is newer, but maintains an old school stadium feel (kind of like Camden Yards in Baltimore).  I'm glad we live so close to this stadium.  It will be in our Spring plans for years to come!    This was also the first baseball game that I ever attended with my son.  That right there gets an automatic 5 stars!

Shit....In N Out is always good, but some are just a little bit better than others.    We came here the other day for lunch.  I went with a Double Double, both kinds of onions and we got some fries to split (mostly for my son).  It was a cheap lunch.  2 Double Doubles, an order of fries and a soda was only $11.50.  Not too bad for a lunch for 3.    The burgers here were pretty delicious as usual but something was just a tad off with them.  I think they were more skimp on the onions, and the cheese wasn't melted and molten hot as usual.  The fries were a little bit overdone and crispy too.  I still gobbled everything up, but it didn't totally satisfy my In N Out craving like it normally does.  This In N Out is also in a semi inconvenient corner location.  If you are going East on Bell, make a right on 83rd, then bust a U turn and make sure to go almost all the way back to Bell in order to get into their parking lot.  I busted a bitch and pulled in a lot thinking it was their parking lot or that I could drive around to get into their parking lot, but you can't.  I wound up parking in the next lot over and walking over to In N Out.  Just a minor inconvenience.   I'm sure I will eventually come back to this one if I am ever in the area craving some In N Out.  It's the closest one to my house in Surprise.  I would come here over the one in Avondale (Worst In N Out I have had outside of the Goleta, CA location), but I would hit up the one near my work in Deer Valley over this one any day (That one is the best In N Out I have had in Arizona, yet)!

I had a strong pizza craving and I didn't feel like driving too far.  My buddy Kate M. had written a review about Lucky's Pizza awhile back and I noticed they were close (still not sure if they are owned by the same folks or not) by so I decided to give them a try.  I called up and placed my order for a Large Cheese Pizza.  They don't ask for your name or phone number, instead they give you a number and tell you how long it will be.  I was told I was #7 and that it would be 15 minutes.  I drove on down, walked inside, paid the lady my money and took my pizza to go.  Friendly folks working there.  Now onto the pizza..............  Large Cheese Pizza ($12.95)-  This thing was nice and big.  The first thing I noticed was that it had a ton of cheese on it.  It also had a little "sheen" to it.  That can be bad sometimes if the pizza is too greasy.  This was not the case here.  No drips of grease anywhere to be found.  I picked up my first slice and noticed that it was just a tad droopy.  I bit in though and was pleasantly Surprise(d) Arizona.....bwahahaha... The taste was great.  Good cheese, good sauce, decent crust.  Next time I come back, I will ask them to cook it well done.  If the cheese had a little brown on it and the crust had just a tad bit of a "crisp", this pizza would have been fantastic!  It was good as is, but could be taken to another level with an extra few minutes in the oven.  This pizza is one of those types that does get better the more you eat though.  First slice I liked, second slice I ate faster, third slice I started to pick up little subtleties that convinced me it was a pretty darn good pizza.  Is it comparable to my favorite, Grimaldis?  Nope.   Is it way better than any chain type place?  Yep!  Will I come back because its a good value, its a local business, it tasted pretty good and its close to my house?  Definitely!  They have multiple specials going on at all times plus they have sandwiches, wings and appetizers.  They make a Sicilian type pizza too that I definitely want to try out.  They have a decent sized eat in area too.  I'm sure Ill be back in due time.

First off, if you are using a Garmin GPS, forget about it. You wont find this place.  This is only the second time it has let me down but still.....you have to go way past where it tells you to go and you might as well ask and stop for directions.  Anyways.....we finally found out how to get here (Off Combs and Meridian) and decided to eat lunch.   I saw a Best Thing I Ever Ate and Beau McMillan picked this as his favorite sandwich or something to that effect.  My wife and I both got the Kalamata sandwich and a fountain drink.  Damage for everything was $24 bucks and change.  They give you a little buzzer that goes off when your food is ready.  They have some seating inside, and a lot more outside.  We grabbed a seat and waited only about 5 minutes.  Picked up our sandwiches, got our drinks and went outside to grub down!  First thing I noticed is that the actual sandwich was way way way smaller then what they showed on TV.   Once I bit in, the size didnt matter that much.  Anyways....this sandwich had 2 kinds of salami, capicola, provolone,arugala, tomato and a creamy herb dressing all on top of a crusty baguette.  The flavors were amazing!  It was a mighty fine sandwich and I devoured it in record time.  They also give you a big pile of kettle chips and a couple of olives. I washed it down with some homemade prickly pear lemonade which was delicious!  Overall it was a solid lunch.  They also have a gift shop where they sell different things like olive oil, stuffed olives, bread, cupcakes made with olive oil etc.  We decided to get a 500ml bottle of their garlic olive oil, some olive tapenade spread and my wife also picked up some lip balm/chapstick things too.   It was a nice little stop.  A tad on the pricey side for everything and not the easiest place to find keep this from being perfect.   Killer sandwich though!

Today was our 6th Anniversary.  My wife wanted to go out to dinner after our movie and decided to choose this place.  I hadn't been to a PF Changs in awhile, so I was stoked to try it out.  We had reservations for 6pm but we were a bit early and arrived at around 5:30.  The place was not too crowded so we were seated right away.    When we were seated, our waiter didn't make it over to us for about 5 minutes or so.  Once he arrived though, the rest of the night went smoothly and because of him, this is why this place gets 5 stars.  I will explain later.  For our food choices, we went with their chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer and chicken lo mein and Chang's spicy chicken as our entree choices.  My wife had a diet Coke and I had water.  Here is how the food was..............  Chicken Lettuce Wraps-  These are always good!  They give you about 6 pieces of lettuce (you can ask for more if needed) as well as a huge mound of minced up chicken and crunchy white noodle things.  We always get this appetizer when we come, and it hasn't disappointed yet.  Chicken Lo Mein-  Chinese spaghetti!  Yeah...pretty much sums it up.  My wife loves lo/chow mein and will always order it at a Chinese place.  PF Chang's version is pretty good.  It did not have that much chicken in it, but at least the noodles and veggies were good.  I personally wouldn't order this again, but if I am with my wife, I will at least take a few bites of hers.  Chang's Spicy Chicken-  This stuff was great!  It was lightly breaded and fried chunks of chicken, tossed in a semi sweet glaze.  It wasn't too spicy like the name promotes, but it did have a warming "kick".  The portion size of this was pretty large, too.  It was tasty!  It was my first time trying it and I would definitely get it again!  Service-  This is where this meal shined!  Like I said earlier, it took awhile for our server Brian to come over to our table (he was busy dealing with other tables..not his fault), but once he did, he provided excellent service.  He was very personable and asked us some questions about the movie we had seen etc.  He checked on us 3 or 4 times throughout our meal, always had drinks refilled in a timely matter, and was just an awesome dude.  The icing on the cake was that when we were done with our meal, he brought out a plate that had "Happy Anniversary" written on it in raspberry puree as well as 2 candles, and 2 chocolate and raspberry dessert won tons on the house.  This was one of the best waiters I can remember having at any restaurant over the last 10 years or so.  He was awesome and did a great job!  Overall, I was pretty impressed and would have given this place about 4 stars.  Food was good, atmosphere was nice, service was great.  I can definitely see us coming back at some point in the future and hope that Brian is our waiter.  He was flat out awesome and definitely made this a 5 star dining experience!

Me and my friend were in the area and decided to stop here for lunch.  I'm always down for some good tacos and this spot looked pretty legit.  From the sound of it, it reminded me of Tacos El Gordo back in SD kind of.    We walked in and placed our order.  I got 3 carne asada tacos on corn tortillas (I noticed here in Phoenix, they give you the option most places..corn or flour) and I got a small carne asada caramelo (quesadilla/mulita).  My friend got some carne asada tacos and some lengua I think.  We had Mexican Cokes to drink.  Quick rundown on how everything was...............  Carne Asada Tacos ($2.00)-  Legit.  The carne asada was cooked over charcoal and had good flavor to it.  Minimal gristle/fat which was nice.  They come plain on double layered corn tortillas.  I topped mine with some onion/cilantro mix and some hot sauce.  They were pretty good...best carne asada tacos I have had so far in Phoenix.  Caramelo ($2.50) -  This was a mini quesadilla with carne asada.  It was filling and delicious.  Same good carne asada and a good helping of cheese.  I would definitely get one again.  They have a larger size too (probably in a flour tortilla) for like $5.00.  Total for everything was around $20.00.  My friend bought me lunch which was awesome and much appreciated!  I even scored an extra taco because she couldn't eat her last one.  When it comes to an additional taco, don't have to tell me twice...ate that sucka in 10 seconds flat!  I could see myself coming back.  This was the closest thing yet to reminding me of Tacos El Gordo or Tacos El Poblano in SD.  The guys working there were friendly and personable.  Nice little spot!

My buddy and I came here one afternoon to get some ice cream.  I got 3 scoops in a waffle bowl.  I got a scoop of salted butter caramel, a scoop of almond butter crunch and a scoop of peanut butter chip.  This ice cream has the same texture of Breyers.  More icy than creamy.  It was freaking delicious though and all 3 flavors were unique in their own way.  It was $6.25 I believe after the waffle bowl was thrown in there.  It was tasty.  My buddy tried the sweet corn ice cream.  I had a taste of it and it was surprisingly good.  He also picked up a bag of bacon brittle.  It was just ok...I thought it would be like crunchy toffee with bacon in it.  It was soft like caramel almost with bacon in it.  Overall it was a good stop and their ice cream flavors are a little crazy, but they all work out somehow.

So.....I have only had pizza once in the past 4 months and it was super crappy.  I needed to get some good pizza in my system asap.   Now that I live in Arizona, a Grimaldis is always close by.  Decided to come down to this one in Peoria (It's only about a 15 minute drive from my new house) for lunch.  I ordered a large cheese pizza and a Diet Pepsi.  I kept it simple today.  Pizza was as good as always.  Great thin/charred crust, fresh mozzarella, great sauce and a little basil.  It's a perfect pizza!  I ate 4 slices and brought the other half home for dinner.  Service was friendly and my waitress brought me another soda right when I was about done with my first...she was on point!  The manager came by to everybody's table and asked them how the food was too.  I will be back sooner than later.  This pizza today made my move to AZ worth it ;-).  I can't say enough good things about Grimaldis.

Not sure about a lot of the other reviews of this spot........I had a great experience here!  The pregnant wife (If you are reading this, and don't know, my wife and I are expecting another kid in July...let's just make this shit "Yelp Official!" right now ;-)  Anyways.......) was craving some Popeyes.  When a pregnant woman craves something, you get off your ass and go get her what she needs.  I love Popeyes myself, so I didn't complain at all about coming down here to pick it up.  It's actually not too far from our place in Surprise.    This Popeyes is rather small and its attached to a gas station.  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by 3 different people!  It wasn't one of those, "Welcome to Popeyes" generic greetings either.  It was strong eye contact, and a welcoming vibe into their shop!  It was much appreciated.  For food, I had a coupon for a free 2 piece meal with purchase of a 3 piece meal.  My wife always gets their spicy strips so I ordered a 5 piece for her.  All together we got 2 breasts, 3 wings, 5 strips, 3 mashed potatoes, 3 biscuits and a drink for around $15.00.  It was a ton of food!  The food was good as usual.  Popeyes makes the best fried chicken (of all the fast food chicken places) and their sides and biscuits are always great, too!  I'm sure we will be back sooner than later.

If you have read my other reviews, you know that I love Grimaldis and think its the best pizza anywhere outside of Totonnos in Brooklyn.  This Grimaldis was on par with all the others.  FLAT OUT AWESOME!  We got 2 pizzas.  A white with pepperoni on it and a regular one with meatballs and roasted red peppers.  Both pizzas were awesome.  I did notice the red sauce here was a little tiny bit more bland than other Grimaldis,  but it didn't hurt the pizza at all.  They slice meatballs really thin and pile them on.  The roasted red peppers are out of this world.  The white pizza has so much flavor with all the olive oil, garlic and cheese they put on.  Fantastic pizzas!  Our waiter was friendly and I give mad props to one of the bus boys that works there.  I forgot my hat and he came running out of the restaurant to give it to me.  Awesome service and awesome pizza=an easy 5 stars!

I had only been to a Trader Joe's maybe 2-3 times in my life before I moved to Surprise.  It was so long ago, I forgot how awesome Trader Joe's is!  We have one on the opposite end of Surprise, and it is well worth the drive over here.  This Trader Joe's is a tad on the small side, but they are always in stock with whatever you need.  Some of my favorite things that I have purchased from Trader Joe's...............  - Pot Stickers- Absolutely awesome!  - Salsas- Green Hatch Chile and their refrigerated Salsa Verde. - Cookies- Thin coconut cookies to their butter waffle cookies, all have been great! - Cookie Butter- Throw that stuff on anything and it tastes great! - Organic tortilla chips- Not too shabby for a store brand!  Service is always friendly, the store is always clean, and the prices are fair!  I will continue to come back to this store when I need/want certain items!  Trader Joe's is great!

My buddy and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights this past week and it was meh....  The good- Priceline.com $25 a night plus tax.  Total came out to about $90 bucks. -Centrally located. -Spacious grounds which were kept up pretty nice. -Fridge in the room and free waters every day.  The bad- $15 resort fee per night automatically tacked on!  Lame!  It did cover wired internet though so it made it a little less weak. -Laying in the bed, rolled over to grab the remote and there was a GIGANTIC cockroach on the floor.  I had to move the bed out and basically chase him before I could deliver my size 12 to his head.  Freaking disgusting and kept me uneasy the whole time there wondering if anymore would show up.  The beds were pretty comfy.  The front desk staff while checking in was indifferent, but the lady I talked to while checking out was super nice.  The hotel after resort fees and stuff like that averaged out to about $40 a night.  That cockroach absolutely killed the stay though.  I never felt comfortable in the room after that and that is why I'm giving this 2 stars.

So.......I just moved into Surprise about 2 months ago.  I received a little packet in the mail with "coupons" inside.  Those things are usually junk and most of the time I toss them immediately in the trash.  This particular envelope though, I opened.  Glad I did.  Inside was a welcoming gift from Barros for a Free Large One Topping Pizza!  Score!  After a long day of driving from San Diego, my wife and I decided to order some takeout.  We got a large pepperoni pizza and we also ordered a large garden salad.  Drove down, picked it up and took it back home.  Here is how everything was..............  Large Pepperoni Pizza-  I have to say, I really liked it!  It reminded me of a Costco style pie but a little bit better.  The crust was a nice medium thickness, it had plenty of good cheese, crisp pepperonis, and had a tasty sauce.  It may have been the best pizza I have had in Surprise (compared to NYPD and Luckys at least) yet.  The fact that it was free made it 10 times better too.  Even if it wasn't free, I think that a large one topping pizza was only like $11-$12.  Totally reasonable!   Large Garden Salad-  This thing was well put together!  It had a ton of lettuce, chopped onions, chopped mushrooms, green peppers, little tomatoes, olives,  croutons, and a nice tasting Italian dressing.  Total for this thing was a bit over $7.00.  Overall, I was impressed.  The workers over the phone and at the store were extremely friendly and chipper.  My food was ready when they told me it would be ready and the taste of the salad and pizza was great!  Our total meal was only about $8.00.  Even without the coupon, it would have been just under $20.00.  Great prices, good food and excellent service make this a place I can totally see continuing to come back to over and over.

Barro's, its been real.  Real freaking dissapointing the last couple of weeks!  I will never order pizza from this location again (Other Barro's I have no issue with).    The last 2 Friday's (3/4/16 and 3/11/16) we ordered pizza from here.  Both times we got the "Barro's Special", and both times, hours later the family had "stomach issues".  I don't mind having the shits every now and then.  As they say, "Shit Happens!"  What I DO mind though,  is after last nights pizza, my 2 year old son got violently ill and what appears to be food poisoning.  Throwing up and shitting water for going on 12 hours now.  Maybe management needs to check who is working on Friday nights and give them some tips on safe food handling.  No excuse for getting sick 2 weeks in a row.  Never coming back!  It really is sad, too.  We loved getting pizza from this place because of the great prices, friendly staff and consistent quality.  Peace out!  (Me, my wife, and her friend all got sick 24 hours later!)  Never ever going back to this place!

Super legit donuts!  Someone at work brought these in last week and unfortunately, I did not get to sample one.  I decided to grab some this morning.  I ordered a dozen and brought them into work to show some love for my new coworkers.  The donuts were delicious!  I got all raised varieties and everyone loved them.  I will be back to try out the cake donuts.  These are up there with Bosa Donuts as the best I have had so far in Phoenix.  It's real close to work which is good and bad.  Good when you want a donut, bad when you are on a diet!

I haven't had ice cream in months...well, real stuff.  I have had sugar free ice cream but not "the good stuff".  I ate kind of crappy today, so I thought I would let the party continue and get myself a real ice cream.  I stopped by here on my way home from the game.  I ordered a 2 scoop Turtle Sundae.  It was just under $5.00.  Paid the lady my money and they give you a number to take with you and keep on your table.  A few minutes later, they brought out my sundae.  Here is how it was..............  Turtle Sundae-  Just by the looks of it, I knew it was going to be fantastic.  This thing was 2 scoops of vanilla custard, caramel sauce, hot fudge, pecans and a cherry on top.  The first I noticed when I dug in were the pecans.  Good lord they hook them up.  Every single bite had a grip of toasted pecans in them.  They were crunchy, salty and flat out delicious.  They don't skimp on them, that's for sure!  The hot fudge and caramel sauce were mixed in well and the custard was cool and creamy.  It was pretty much a perfect sundae.  I was sad when the spoon hit the bottom of the cup.  I don't know how often I will be back...I need to get back on the wagon of my low carb plan this week.  Their food options look decent too.  I do know one thing though....  If I ever need a sundae, I know where I'm coming for one.  It's only about 5 miles from my house and I really enjoyed the combo of flavors, especially those pecans...they were the star of the show.  The girls working the counter were friendly too.

My mother in law, wife and I went to this show on Wednesday night at 7pm.  Quick rundown of everything.  Seats-5 stars+++  We had some seats originally that were mid range but my mother in law hooked us up and upgraded our seats so we were in the front row right in the center of the stage.  Besides seeing Willie Nelson at the Fillmore and being 10 feet away from him, these were the best seats I have ever sat in to see an event.  My mother in law is cool like that and wanted to get us the best...and she did!  Show- 4 stars.  Like others have said, its more of a tribute, dance routine show rather than an acrobatic type shindig.  I had never been to a Cirque show, so I was expecting 70 pound dudes and chicks flying through the air doing backflips and shit like that.  This show had some of that but not as much as I expected from a Cirque show.  The coolest part was the trampoline portion of it.  They would do divebombs and run up the walls etc.  It was cool.  The sets and props they had for the show were amazing.  Really massive sets and everything went together well.  The music was awesome and if you love Elvis, you will enjoy this show.  Price- 2 stars.  The only thing I didn't like about it was the price.  This show is 90 minutes long and the final tally on our seats were $200.00 each.  The mother in law covered a majority of that which was awesome, but we sill had to pay about $130 each.  If I had to do it again and pay full price out of my own pocket  I would never pay close to that.....$50 bucks definitely.....$100 maybe.....$200 no way jose.  I know Vegas is expensive and all but that is almost highway robbery.   (Side rant)  I can see why its so freaking expensive too....its in the Aria.....they charge you $5 bucks for a Coke from the bar!  They did have an awesome sportsbook though with super comfy chairs.  Overall, I give this 4 stars.  The seats were the best, the show was very entertaining, but the price was too steep.

Not much else to say except that this place is within walking distance from my hotel.  Score!  Best coffee in the world.  It has a drive through and service was friendly at the window.  I'm a happy camper and will return multiple times over the next 4 days.

4.5 stars.   I grew up in LA and have never gone to Roscoes (OG chicken and waffles place in Los Angeles).  I like chicken and I like waffles.  Not sure why I never went but one day I will.  Here in AZ we have Lo-Lo's.  Tons of great reviews and an endorsement by Charles Barkley was good enough for me.  A chicken and waffle meal was definitely going to happen on this trip.  This morning it did!  We cruised into the place around 10:00am and there were a couple of people already grubbing down.  We were greeted by a nice gentlemen named Carl.  He told us to grab a seat wherever we wanted and that he would be over in a minute.  He cruised by and got us started with our drinks.  I ordered myself a Red Kool Aid..my wife got water.  Carl brought back our drinks in these huge mason jars.  I was impressed.  They freaking have Kool Aid on tap here.  How cool is that?  I started to drink my "Red Drank"...it was delicious!  Super duper sweet but I am down with that.  It was refreshing.  Haven't had Kool Aid that good since my grandma used to make it when I was a kid.  Between Kool Aid and Tang, my grandma knew how to mix up the powdered beverages.  Anyways.......  We placed our order with Carl soon after.  My wife and I both decided to get the Number 5...the Sheedahs Special.  Its one waffle, one breast and one wing.  We also got a side of collard greens.  Less than 10 minutes later our food was up.  Here is how everything tasted.....................  Waffle-  Large waffle with a huge dollop of butter on top.  It came with a little thing of syrup too.  I noticed right away that the waffle was pretty soft.  I prefer my waffles to have a little crisp when I bite into them and this one did not.  It still was pretty damn good though.  It held the butter and syrup well and I ate the whole thing.  You could sense a hint of cinnamon and something else in it...maybe vanilla?  I couldn't pinpoint it.  It did its job though.  Fried Chicken-  I got hooked up because my wife gave me her wing so I had 2 wings and a breast.  The coating is a light breading.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, crunchy outside, moist inside.  It was some damn good chicken!  By far the best part of the meal.  Collard Greens-  These were just alright.  I've only had them once or twice before and unfortunately I liked them better the previous times.  I tried to power through most of these but left some uneaten.  I would not get them again.  Overall this place was great!  Carl provided great service and was genuinely friendly and cared about what we thought of the food.  He was on top of everything and made our meal enjoyable.  It was damn near perfect!  A little crunch/crisp on the waffle and we have ourselves a perfect meal.  The chicken was on point and the Kool Aid was great.  I will definitely be back on future visits to AZ!

Amazing pizza.  We went here on July 5th about noon and nobody was there. 2 other couples and thats it. With pizza this good that is a damn shame.   We were greeted right away and seated immediately.  Real nice server named John took our order.  We got a large pepperoni and fresh garlic.  That was a winning combo for sure!!  This was in the top 5 pizzas I have ever had.  We went to the original in Brooklyn 2 years ago and guess what......This was better!!  If it werent for Totonnos, Pepes and Modern, this would be number 1 :-).  Everything was perfect.  The garlic made it super tasty but not overpowering.  Large pizza and 2 sodas for 25 bucks.  Cant beat that.  I overheard some of the workers talking about advertising down at the strip to try and get some more business.  Guess the "tourists" dont come out here.  This place is off the 215 about 10 minutes out of town and well worth the drive.  An excellent pizza and a definite stop on all future trips to Sin City.

DAMN!  Simply the best!  I got a coupon for a free pizza so my lady and I decided to come back on our way out of Vegas this past weekend.   We got a small mediteranean salad and a large pepperoni and garlic pizza.  This is perfect pizza in every possible way.  Crispy crust, charred bottom, fresh mozz, savory pepperoni and great garlic.  Just flat out awesome!  Its definitely in the top 5 pizzas I have consumed in my life.   If you have never been, please go!  Its by far the best pizza you can get anywhere outside of New York!

Still the best!  I came here straight from the airport and decided to try out a new combo.  I got a personal sausage and onion pie.  Great flavors!  Friendly staff and great pizza as always!  I need a teleportation device so I can go to the different Grimaldis across the US whenever I want.  If I am ever in a city that has one, it is a must do!

Came here once again with the family and got 3 pizzas.  A large pepperoni and garlic, a personal tomato, mushroom and pepperoni, and a personal meatball and roasted red pepper.  The 3 pizzas were perfect for our group of 5.  None went to waste and we all left full.  My new favorite combo is the meatball and roasted red peppers.  Ive got it the last few times I have made it to a Grimaldis and its been amazing every single time.  They slice the meatballs real thin and then pile them on.  Its a great combo of flavors and I would recommend it if you haven't tried it before.  One of the managers there told us that they are looking into branching out into Southern California some time in the next few years.  I instantly got a boner!  I heard they couldn't have them out here because of the coal ovens and pollution or something to that effect.  The guy assured us that's not why and they really are looking to come out to CA sometime soon.  Cross the fingers....that would be A M A Z I N G!

I was texting with my friend Kate and she had mentioned that she was going to Popeye's for lunch.  She planted the damn seed!  I had seen a commercial recently for their Pepper Barrel Tenders, too, and they looked delicious.  I decided to come down here for lunch.  I've been to this Popeye's a handful of times (surprised I never wrote a review) and its only about 2 miles from my work.    I placed my order for the Pepper Barrel combo which comes with 3 strips, choice of side (fries), a biscuit and a drink.  $6.49.  Not bad..not bad at all.  Here is how everything was...............  Pepper Barrel Tenders-  Popeye's chicken strips are some of the best in the land.  When I used to live in SD, we could hit up the Popeye's in El Cajon a lot!  Glad to report that their strips are pretty consistent out here in AZ!  These Pepper Barrel Tenders are marinated in a Tabasco sauce and then fried up.  You could immediately tell that they looked a little different than the normal strips.  They were nice and spicy and had great flavor.  The tenders were a bit smaller than I had remembered, but they did give me 4 of them instead of 3, maybe to compensate the skimp size?  Anyways....I got some sweet heat sauce with them and they were delicious.  I would get them again for sure.  Fries-  Popeye's fries are hit and miss.  When they are good, they are really good.  When they are bad, they are flat out nasty.  Today they were really good!  Nice and hot, crisp and full of flavor due to their seasoning/coating.  If their fries were like this all the time, I would be happy.  If you aren't a fry fan, you can never go wrong with their mashed potatoes and gravy!  Biscuit- Popeye's biscuits are fantastic!  Full of butter, fluffy but sometimes they have a bit of a crunch when you bite in.  I love them and could eat half a dozen.  Drinks- Coke products...score!  Service is always prompt.  Maybe not the friendliest, but they do get you your food really quick.  One other thing.......for whatever reason, in my fucked up, crazy mind,  this Popeye's seems like it should have a bullet proof glass window up at the counter.  This Popeye's is not in the hood or anything, and it doesn't NEED a bullet proof glass window, but if it did have one, it would seem more "complete". Some Feng Shui type shit.   If I was a Popeye's architect, I'd definitely install one here!   Random, I know......right?  Anyways....Popeye's is good shit!  I know I will be back soon enough!

I had read about this place before and it sounded interesting.  When my friend Kate wrote a review about it, I knew that eventually I had to check it out.  Her review of the place was that it was good albeit a bit expensive.  The manager of that particular location (not this one here), wrote her back explaining their ingredients, pricing structure etc.  I thought that was pretty cool that they would write back like that after seeing some small issues within a review.  That is a good customer service and I like to go to places that exude that.  I was at work one day and decided to place an order for pick up.  I went with a plain cheese pizza.  90% of the time, that is my order at a new joint.  If they make a good cheese pizza, the rest of their pizzas should be good too!  I drove up the 17 to pick it up.  I parked and walked in.  Here is what transpired...........  I walked into the place and was greeted by the hostess.  I told her that I had ordered a pizza and she told me that I could go to the bar and pick it up there.  I got to the bar and told the bartender that I had ordered a pizza.  He then left said bar area and went back to the front of the store where I came in at.  He picked up the pizza from there and then brought it back to the bar area.  Maybe it would be easier to just have the hostess ring everything up and handle takeout orders?  Anyways..........I paid for my pizza and took it to go.  I brought it out to my car and dug in.  Here is how it was.............  Small Cheese Pizza ($9.49)-  I opened this up and could tell by the looks of it that it would be good!  It was cut into 4 large slices.  I picked up the first slice and bit in.  It was delicious!  The crust was a thinner crust but was sturdy and held up well.  You could fold this slice in half and eat it no problem.  The sauce and cheese were great.  I learned from my friend Kate that they use 100% whole milk mozzarella and you could totally tell.  It wasn't greasy at all and it was salty and delicious.  Now on to the crust.....  They butter up their crust and then top it with sprinkled Parmesan cheese.  The crust was awesome!  Thick enough to chew but still tender at the same time.  The Parmesan cheese topping sent it over the top.  Messy on your fingers and hands, but delicious!  I woofed down those 4 slices pretty darn quick.  It was a really good pizza.  I would definitely come back.  It is not the cheapest pizza out there, but it is definitely delicious and I could see myself craving it at one point down the road.  Its only a few miles from work too, so that is good!  I was impressed.

Well, if you read my first review of this place, you would have thought that I might never return.  I have been back a few times since then, and the smell of piss is gone at least ;-).  The food is 3 star worthy most of the time,  A-OK.  Most people that come visit us are from either LA or San Diego, so on their way out of town, we usually drive down here to get some breakfast.  It's right off the freeway, and it sends people on their way with a full stomach at least (Cracker Barrels portions are ALWAYS pretty large..props for that).  We decided to come here on Sunday for a late breakfast (10:45am).  I browsed the menu, and something caught my eye.  The Sunday Homestyle Chicken Dinner (After 11:00am, only on Sundays!).  I decided to order that with mac and cheese and hash brown casserole as my "veggies".  Here is how it was............  Sunday Homestyle Chicken Dinner-  This thing is a beast!  It comes with 2 boneless chicken breasts dipped in their buttermilk batter and fried golden brown.  These are not small breasts either.  If they were in the human female form, they would be at least DD's!  These breasts were huge!  They were fried up perfectly, hot and crunchy and still moist in the middle.  I was extremely impressed and this instantly became the best thing I have ever had at Cracker Barrel!  My wife ordered the same thing and she was just as impressed.  This fried chicken was fantastic!  One of the better fried chicken items I have ever had!  As far as my sides....Mac and cheese.  It was just ok.  Pretty creamy and tasty enough, but it didn't knock my socks off and I would probably get a different side next time.  The other side was their hash brown casserole.  I have always been a big fan of this.  Its like a hash brown pie.  The potatoes are nicely browned, the flavor has hints of cheese and onions, and overall, it is always a winner.  A must have side dish when at Cracker Barrel.  Oh yeah, this dinner also comes with either corn bread of buttermilk biscuits/muffins.  I went with the muffins and they were tasty.  I ate those last because the sheer size of the 2 chicken breasts was filling me up pretty quick.  Even though I was full, the biscuits with a little butter, hit the spot.  Overall, it was an excellent meal!  I think I may only come to Cracker Barrel after 11am on Sundays from here on out.  That whole gigantic meal was less than $10.00!  Can't beat that at all.  That fried chicken meal on its own, is damn near 5 stars.  Cant say enough good things about it!  If you are ever there on a Sunday, definitely order it...you will be glad you did!

My son was born with a small hole in his heart.  We went to a cardiologist last year in SD and then today was his one year follow up appointment here in Phoenix.  Things went incredibly well!  His hole is shrinking and (knock on wood) will not require any type of surgery!  This hospital is really nice!  Staff was friendly, wait times were nonexistent, waiting room was nice, new and welcoming, its easy to get to, parking is free and their pricing structure was awesome.  If you pay on the spot, you get a huge discount on services rendered.  This was our first major doctors expense this year, so to meet our deductible, we paid on the spot and it will wind up saving us hundreds of dollars out of pocket!  Score!  I have complete faith in this hospital if/when we have to return.  I was very impressed!

I saw a deal on Living Social for a membership. See link below.   (I think it expires in a few days...chop chop if you are interested).  https://www.livingsocial.com/deals/1275742-sam-s-club-plus-membership-gift-card-food  You get a one year membership, 4 free items AND a $20 gift card on the spot, all for $45.00.  That simply cannot be beat!     We came in at about 7pm tonight to redeem our certificate.  The lady helping us out at guest services was extremely friendly and helpful.  Total time up at the desk was only about 5 minutes or so.  Once we got out memberships, we decided to do some shopping.  It's reminded me of a "boutique" Costco kind of.  It had a lot of the same items but was just a little bit smaller.  We got some bottled water, salami, cheeses, pineapple, grapes etc.  The produce looked very fresh compared to the local grocery stores around town.  Prices were on par for other warehouse type places.  Why 5 stars?  The cashier and workers were very friendly, this place is only 5 minutes from my house (Costco is 20 minutes), prices are good AND its not crowded at all.  $45.00 for a year membership is worth it on its own....throw in the fact that you get the gift card and some free things (cookies, bread, roasted chicken and a spinach dip), this makes it a no brainer as far as value goes.  We will come here often and stock up on supplies!

My friend (plays guitar, bass, drums etc) and his wife (plays piano) were in town, and they wanted to check this place out.  I remembered my buddy Dave G. wrote a review of this place, it sounded cool, so I decided to join them on their visit to the museum.    Admission was $20.00 per person.  My friends are college teachers/professors, so they got in for free!  How cool is that?  They were kind enough to split the cost with me, so I really got in for $10.00.  Even at $20.00, this place is well worth it!  You check in and pay at the front desk, then you are handed a pair of headphones and are free to walk about the museum.  The headphones automatically play whatever you are looking at.  They were a bit shoddy on the bottom level where they would cut in and out, but for the most part, they played fine and would seamlessly transition between the different exhibits.   We started on the bottom floor and made our way up top.  They have SO MANY different instruments from all over the world!  They have the sections broken down by continent for the most part.  You had Africa, USA/Canada/Mexico, Europe, Asia etc.  Some of these instruments I had never heard of before, and they were incredibly fascinating to look at and listen to (on the videos they play).  Tons of stuff from every genre of music could be found in the USA section.  Everything from country, to electronica, to hip hop, rock and roll etc.  Very interesting stuff!  We were only there about 2 hours, but could have easily stayed the whole day.  I am definitely going to come back and spend more time in each exhibit.  They even have a "hands on" exhibit where you can play different types of instruments!  Kids would love this place!  Overall, I was incredibly impressed.  I have been to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Sun Records, Stax Records etc. and none of those places were as cool as this one!  This was the best music museum I have ever seen, and would highly recommend it to anybody!  Even if you don't think you will like it or find it interesting, I would come anyways.  I guarantee you will find something you will enjoy!  I cannot wait to come back!

I was walking back to my car and passed this place.  Ice cream is my favorite food.  Did you think I wasn't going to stop? ;-)  I walked inside and was greeted by a super happy, cheerful young lady.  I browsed their selections for a minute and decided on a double scoop in a sugar cone.  I forget the exact name of the ice cream I got, but I know it was made by Karens Kreamery down in Avondale.  It was a cookies and cream type ice cream with something else mixed in.  $4.50 and I was out the door.  The ice cream was pretty good!  Nice and rich and incredibly smooth.  Tons of cookie pieces throughout.  The only reason for 4 stars was the lack of variety.  As others have said, most of their flavors were regular Dryers brand and they only had 3-4 selections of "good stuff".  The building is cool, and the service was excellent.  I would come back if I was in the neighborhood!

While not my preferred hardware store, Ace is still a great little spot!  I have been here maybe 5 times since I moved into the neighborhood.  If I need something quick, and don't feel like driving down to Home Depot, I stroll by here.  Prices are decent, and my favorite part of the store are the employees!  Every single time I have been in there, I have had multiple people ask me what I was looking for and helped me find stuff.  Great customer service...way better than Home Depot!  They don't carry everything, but for the most part, they have what you need.  It's good to know that this place is just a few minute drive from my house.  I know for sure that I will be back!

My wife loves this place.  Why?  Why?  (Shaking my head.)  We were out and about today and decided to stop by here because she saw some curtains she wanted for our new house.  Right when I walked in, I knew I wouldn't like the place.  There were way too many people there, the aisles were small, and the selection of stuff was just odd.  Chocolate covered cashews were sitting next to a throw pillow which was sitting next to a huge clock which was sitting next to a soap dispenser which was sitting next to some coffee from Belize.  The setup was just really fucking weird and random shit was everywhere!    I did purchase a pretty nice shower caddy thing for $12.00 plus the cashier was really friendly and gave my son a sticker.  Those are the only reason this gets 2 stars.  My wife can come back anytime she wants...I know for damn sure I personally won't be back!

Due to a heavy footed neighbor upstairs in our hotel, I was up and about around 6am.  I knew I needed some coffee and donuts.  Dunkin Donuts is right near my hotel so I went and got a cup of coffee there.  Then headed here to get some donuts.  The Yelpers of Scottsdale did me right.  These donuts were very good....not Marys donuts good (Marys holds a special place in my heart and will always be my favorite), but maybe 2nd place ;-).    Still a 5 star joint! Placed my order for a chocolate covered buttermilk bar, a glazed raised, a chocolate raised and a crumb raised.  Total was $3.70 for 4 donuts.  Not shabby at all.  Here is how the donuts stacked up.  Chocolate Buttermilk Bar-  DAMN!  This was one of the best donuts I can ever remember eating!  This thing was crisp on the outside for a little crunch, dense on the inside (almost like a pound cake) for a good "cake like" chew and had a ton of chocolate on it.  During the bites you could pick out the distinct buttermilk flavor.  This thing was awesome and I'm definitely coming back before I leave to get more of these.  They also had them in maple frosting and something else too.  Delicious!  Glazed-  Not too shabby.  Very light and airy and not too sweet.  Definitely a good donut and I would get it again.  Crumb- Pretty tasty also.  Good crumb topping and light and airy like the glazed.  Chocolate Raised- My wife ate that one and I didn't try it.  She liked it though and that's good enough for me.  If it was as good as the other 3 donuts, I'm sure it was great.  The lady at the counter was nice as can be and they even have a drive through!  If I lived in the area, this would definitely be my go to donut spot.  Bravo for the recommendations Scottsdale Yelpers....Bravo!

So...we had a baby girl named Lindsey on 7/13/16.  This was where we had her.  Everything was excellent!  Rooms were comfy, nurses were all excellent.  Food was decent, free parking, nice facilities etc.  Can't say I would change anything about our stay.  Everything was excellent and if you are going to have a child, this is a great hospital to have them at!

Not too sure about Phoenix folks tastes in burgers.  2nd 4.5 star joint in a row that was meh!  Seeing is the name of this place is "Rocketburger", that is exactly what I got.  I ordered a Rocketburger with cheese and a fountain drink.  My total was just under $12.00.  Here is how it was..........  Rocketburger with cheese-  Meh.  This thing came with 3 patties, lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese.  It also had pickles and a "rocket sauce" aka thousand island.  The bun was a sub type roll and was fine.  All the ingredients were not that great though.  The burgers were way way way too salty, small and didn't taste good. The dressing had a weird "tang" to it also.  The cheese and bun were the only good things about it.  At around $10.00, I was dissapointed.  My mouth was swollen dry afterwards because of the salt!  Never again!  I ate the whole thing but would never get another one.  Diet Pepsi-  This was partly my bad.  They have 1000 or so bottled sodas for sale but I chose a fountain drink.  The Diet Pepsi was nasty!   The worst fountain soda I have ever had.  Tasted like root beer mixed with dirty water.   So nasty!  The guy at the counter and the guy who brought me my burger were friendly.  The food was below average and pricey,  and the soda was straight up nasty! Unfortunately I'm never coming back.

So....I was going to visit my uncle in Sun Lakes today.  I had a sandwich at Pane Bianco and then decided I wanted some dessert.  I saw that this was kind of on the way to my Uncles house, so I decided to stop in.  I went with an Arroz Con Leche and a Mango Con Chile.  They are $2.50 each and here is how they were...........  Arroz Con Leche-  I ate this one first.  It was like eating rice pudding on a stick.  It was damn delicious.  It had hints of what seemed like cinnamon throughout and was nice and creamy and refreshing for this hot day.  I liked it a lot and can envision getting it again.  Mango Con Chile-  This was my second popsicle I ate.  This one was fantastic!  It had a ton of chile in it.  It was spicy and hit you in the back of the throat yet it wasn't so overpowering that you needed some water or so that you couldn't enjoy it.  I enjoyed every bite of it!  The texture was awesome and it was filled with pieces of mango bits.  The flavor of the fruit and the chile together was a great combo!  I will definitelyget this flavor again the next time I come.  $5.00 for 2 popsicles is a steal!  I will be back soon enough.

Today I used my "Get out of e.coli free" or should I say, my "e.coli stimulus package", free burrito coupon.   Who am I to turn down a free burrito?  I hadn't been to a Chipotle in years, anyways.  After today's visit, I was reminded why.  Chipotle just isn't that good!  Their salads are good for a low carb option, but everything else there has never ever impressed me.  You will see why, below........  I drove down, parked, and walked in the place.  I was greeted immediately and that was about the only good thing I could say.  As soon as I walked in the door, some young employee (douchebag looking "bro") that was on the fryer cooking some chips let out a huge belch.  You could hear the thing echo throughout the restaurant.  How unprofessional is that? I mean, come on dude...you are working, and acting like you are at the frat house with your bros.  If I was a manager on duty, I definitely would have said something to him.  Anyways........... After that nice "welcoming belch", I ordered my burrito.  The first guy who got my tortilla ready was like a robot. Instead of asking a question, he just kind of shouted,  "White or brown, black or pinto".  I knew what he meant (what kind of rice and beans), but if this was your first time at Chipotle, you wouldn't have any idea of what the fuck he was talking about.  Anyways....I went with a steak burrito, white rice, no beans.  Down the line, I added hot sauce, cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  My burrito was wrapped up (piss poor, might I add), I had the lady scan my coupon, purchased a drink for $2.00 and sat down to eat.  Here is how it was..........  Steak Burrito-  Like I said earlier, this burrito was wrapped horribly!  There was salsa leaking out the bottom, sour cream smeared on the side, and it almost completely fell apart when I first picked it up.  I soon realized that there was no way I could eat this burrito with my hands.  I basically cut that shit up with my fork and ate it that way.  On to the ingredients........... The steak was whack!  It had a rubbery texture to it and was tough to chew.  The hot sauce tasted ok.  The sour cream was overkill and the cheese kind of got lost in it.  The only good thing in that burrito was the guacamole.  I will give Chipotle that...they make a decent guacamole.  The tortilla was crappy, too!  I ate the whole thing because I don't like to waste food, but about 1/4 of the way through it, I was over it.  It I had paid for it, I would have been pissed!    Honestly, I don't know if I am ever coming back to any Chipotle.  I know for damn sure I wont be coming back to this one!  It takes a lot for me to bitch about free food, but I am bitching right now!  Totally disappointed in today's visit!

I was craving a sandwich and one of the chain type places would not cut it.  I saw this place while driving to work one day (they have a huge banner out front...they won Best Bakery in Phoenix 2013 I guess.) and decided to come here for lunch the other day.  I walked in the joint and felt a bit uneasy at first.  The space is a bit cluttered (they have stuff thrown about on a few tables like its an office) and I didn't see too many items in the display cases.  I was greeted by a nice lady who asked me what I wanted.  I ordered the Italian sandwich.  She grabbed a loaf of bread from the display case, then got down to business.  They keep their meats in a regular refrigerator  next to the sandwich prep station.  She started unwrapping meats and cheese and started slicing them up.  It took her awhile because of so many meats on this thing!   It was made fresh on the spot though so that was awesome!  Kind of reminded me of a deli from back east in Philly.  She assembled my sandwich, I paid her $10.00 and I was on my way.  Here is how it tasted....................  Italian Sandwich-  This thing was packed to the gills!  It had mortadella, castagna (never heard of it before), sopresatta, capacola, provolone and veggies (olives, lettuce, red peppers, tomatoes).  Every single meat was sliced thin and of the highest quality!  This was some good stuff.  Not sure what brand of meat they use, but it was top shelf!  The cheese was a nice sharp provolone sliced razor thin.  It was great!  The lettuce was crisp, there was plenty of olives, and the Italian dressing was tasty.  The only weak part of the sandwich was the tomatoes (I say its due to the fact that AZ has pretty shitty produce in general).  The bread that this was served on was soft yet had a crispy sturdy exterior.  It was really good bread and worked perfectly for this sandwich!  4 stars for now and it was probably the best sandwich I have had in Phoenix besides Pane Biancos Sopresatta.  I'm sure I will be back if a hoagie hankering hits me.

After I went to Little Miss BBQ, I decided that I needed some ice cream.  I had this bookmarked and decided to have some dessert.  It was bomb!  I walked in and looked over the menu real quick.  It was a tough choice between the "Smores Sundae" or the "Rocky Road Lil Freezie".  While I was looking at the menu, the voice of Sloth  in The Goonies popped into my head....... "Rocky Roooooaadddd". That was it.  I ordered a Rocky Road Lil Freezie.  This creation came with 2 (possibly more) scoops of ice cream, it was stuffed full of chocolate covered almonds and then topped with some marshmallow fluff.  They constructed my ice cream and then at the very last minute they bust out the blow torch to toast my marshmallow.  They handed over the goods and here is how it was.................  Rocky Road Lil Freezie-  This thing was great!  They give you a huge scoop of marshmallow and then toast it for you.  This is placed upon 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream and then its mixed in with chocolate covered almonds.  The almonds were almost like an almond bark.  They were really delicious!  They blend it up like a concrete/blizzard and then hand it over.    I will come back the next time I am allowed to eat ice cream ;-) and try out some of their other stuff.  It's not cheap....almost $7.00 for my concoction but it was very refreshing and one hell of an ice cream treat.

Solid 4 with room for more!   This place is only about a 5 minute drive from work, but if I am coming down this way, I am headed to Chino Bandido next door.  Today, I was headed to Chino Bandido, but I decided to veer left and check out Good Fellas.  They had an intriguing sign outside the door, too!  (3 meat lunch special for $5.99 between 11am-2pm).  I walked inside and went up to the counter.  It was probably about 2:08pm and I asked the dude at the counter if I could still get the lunch special.  He hooked me up at the $5.99 price (good man!)!  While sitting there, other people came in looking for the same thing, but he informed them that after 2pm, it went up to $7.99.  Still, as you will see, either price is a great deal!  I paid the man my money and was asked if I wanted a free bowl of soup while I waited.  I declined the soup, but it was a nice gesture, and if I was eating in, I would have taken him up on his offer.  Anyways....about 15 minutes later, my food was brought out to me and I was on my way back to the office to dig in.  Here is how it was..............  3 Meat Lunch Combo-  This plate comes with 3 meats, (chicken, kafta, and gyro) rice, a salad and 4 slices of pita bread along with some yogurt/hummus type dip. I dug into the kafta and rice first.  The kafta is basically a ground beef kebab.  It was seasoned well and very tasty!  I'm usually not the biggest fan of rice (unless its fried), but this rice was delicious!  It was the perfect texture, flavor and temperature!  I tried the gyro meat next.  It was topped with a cucumber/dill type sauce and was seasoned perfectly, also!  Last up was the chicken!  They only gave you 2 pieces of chicken, but those 2 pieces were fantastic!  The chicken had a nice char grilled taste while not being dried out.  I couldn't decide which one was my favorite.  All 3 of them were excellent.  The pita bread was great, too!  They give you 4 slices of pita bread and  a little cup of yogurt type dipping sauce.  Great flavors all around!  The only thing I didn't touch was the salad.  It was getting a bit wilted (drive back to work with hot items in the container...probably should have been separate from the hot items) and I tossed it out.  Everything else was fanfreakingtastic though!  Service was very friendly, and I appreciated the hookup of the lunch price even though it was a few minutes past the time frame.  The food did take a little while to come out, but it was definitely hot and fresh, so it was worth the wait.  I may call in a to go order next time though.  I'm sure I will be back in due time!  It was a great lunch!

Picked up some donuts for my buddy.  I have been to other Bosa donuts before and they were awesome.  Came to this one since it was the closest location to where I was.  I got a half dozen.  The only bummer was that they did not have my favorite kind....buttermilk bars!   Fresh out.  Whack!  Their donuts are delicious though and warrant 4 stars on their own.  If you have a chance to try the buttermilk bars, get them immediately.  Possibly the best donut in the land.  If I am ever in the area, and craving donuts, Bosa is usually always the right choice!

Cant believe I haven't written a review for this spot!  This DD is located right down the road from my house.  It's my go to one, and for the most part it is always awesome!  Never been the biggest fan of their donuts themselves, but their muffins are great and their drinks are where its at!  My Summer obsession is their iced coffee.  Right now you can get a medium one for $1.50 or so.  Score!  Sign up for their Dunkin Donuts Perks and download the app....even more great deals on there!  You also get a free beverage (anything you want) for signing up.  Service is usually friendly and cheerful.  They have skipped out on giving me napkins a few times, and every now and then you get a worker that is semi pissy, but 90% of the time, it's usually a good experience.  I will continue to keep coming back!

Average of 4.5 stars?  Eh.....I unfortunately disagree.  This is like barely 2 stars.  In honor of National Cheeseburger Day, I decided to go and get one.  I had this place bookmarked and it was close enough to work that I decided to have my cheeseburger here.  I should have gone somewhere else :-(.  It wasn't horrible,  but it was far from great.  I rolled in the joint and placed my order for a Paradise Valley Cheeseburger with an extra patty, sweet potato tots and a Diet Coke.   After I placed my order, the cashier dude started talking baseball with me (I wear my St. Louis Cardinal hat all the time) and started asking how the Cardinals were doing etc.  That was cool and the best part about the visit.   I paid the man my money, $11.60 something and then took a seat.  I noticed that the place was a little bit dirty.  The trash was overflowing, flies were on the windows and a lot of tables were dirty.  I hoped for the best............. A few minutes later, my food came out.  Here is how it was....................  Double Cheeseburger-  Um....it was just alright.  It was presented nicely with a toasted bun and some fancy toppings, but it lacked "goodness".  This thing came with 2 small burgers, cheddar cheese, thousand island and then it was topped with veggies.  Not sure if they are trying to be fancy, but the veggies didn't really work.  They had a tomato, pickled onions which were tasteless and 3 cucumbers....not pickles...didnt taste any vinegar.  I tasted cucumber.  The burgers didn't have much flavor, the cheese was ok, the thousand island was runny.  The bun was alright.  I was not impressed.  I ate the whole thing but did not really enjoy it at all.  Sweet Potato Tots-  Meh...frozen, not really crispy, no flavor, semi small portion.  I used the ketchup on the table and it was runny too (just like the thousand island).  I only ate a few of them and tossed 75%.  Meh.  Diet Coke-  Even this tasted a little off.  Not enough carbonation or something.   Overall I was sadly not impressed at all!  $12.00 for my meal, the burger was kind of small and tasteless and the tots were just plain boring.  The only good thing about the meal was my chat about baseball.  That is kind of sad.  I will not be coming back.

Possibly the first AND last time here.  I had read about this place and thought that it was a cool concept....do one thing and do one thing well (chicken fingers).  I decided to stop here on my way down to the game.  I went through the drive through and placed my order.  I ordered "The Box Combo" which included 4 chicken strips, cole slaw, fries and a drink.  The price wasn't bad (under $7.00) and it sounded like it would be fantastic.  The drive through line took at least 10 minutes before I got my food.  Once I did get the goods, I pulled over, parked and dug in.  Here is how the food was............  Chicken Strips-  Meh!  The strips were a decent size but there were a couple of things working against them.     #1.  These things were WAY too hot.  I appreciate freshly made food but maybe you might want to let that shit sit for a minute and drain or something.  These were so hot you couldn't even eat them without burning your mouth.  Even after mouth breathing/cooling and sitting there for 10 minutes, my last strip was as scorching as the first!    #2.  I really didn't like the breading.  It is a really thin coating that is just a bit greasy.  The breading was kind of falling off in pieces and just seemed a bit "off".     #3.  The taste of these things.  They were super duper plain jane.  It seemed like they could use a ton more seasoning and really didn't have any flavor.  The dipping sauce helped, but still didn't make up for the fact that these strips looked good but had no taste.  Were they the nastiest things I have ever had?  No.  Can I make just as good or better chicken strips at home?  Yep!  This is their niche and unfortunately I didn't think they were anything special.  I much prefer Popeyes strips...at least they have flavor!  Fries-  Standard crinkle cut fries.  They were ok.  Crispy but needed some more salt.  Cole Slaw- Didn't try it.  Texas Toast-  This was the best part of the meal.  Kind of reminded me of Sizzlers cheese toast but lesser quality (That is one thing Sizzler does better than anyone else....cheese toast.)  If I could have traded my fries and/or slaw for another slice, I would have done it.  Soda- Coke Zero tasted a little "off".  I have had a few instances so far in Phoenix where fountain soda has tasted weird.  Don't know what it is but Raising Cane's Coke Zero is in the same boat.  Sauce- Their sauce is a mayo based sauce...I took a tiny taste and didn't like it.  I did pay extra to get some honey mustard.  Their honey mustard sauce is actually pretty good.  Service in the drive through was friendly.  Slow but friendly.  I personally probably won't come back but I can see myself ending up here eventually...my wife loves chicken strips and I'm sure she will want to try this place out and I will be forced here with her.  Meh, right?  We shall see................

I had passed by this place numerous times over the past few days.  I had also read that they had a burger that had won "Best Burger in the Valley 2012".  I looked up their website and saw that it was the Basil Mascarpone Burger.  It sounded very interesting so I decided to come down and try it out.  I walked into the joint and there was only one other customer in there who was talking with one employee.  The nice lady behind the counter asked me what I wanted.  I ordered the Basil Mascarpone Burger cooked medium and fries as my side.  That and a drink came out to around $12.00.  I took a seat in front of their gigantic TV and started to watch the game.  About 10 minutes later, my burger was ready and they brought it out to me.  Here is how it tasted...........  Basil Marscapone Burger-  This thing looked delicious!  The smell of the basil was very fragrant.  This burger comes with a 1/3lb patty, a nice artisan bun that is smeared liberally with mascarpone cheese, tomatoes, roasted portabello mushrooms, carmalized onions and then its namesake,  little ribbons of basil.  I took a bite in and got all the flavors at once.  The burger was cooked a perfect pink medium and had a great beefy flavor, the onions were sweet, the cheese was creamy, the mushrooms nice and tender, the strips of basil very pungent and delicious and the bun was soft yet held everything together.  This burger IS a messy one.  It is piled high and totally worth getting your face/hands/shirt dirty.  Just dig in!  I could see how it won "Best Burger".  It was definitely unique and definitely tasty!  French Fries-  The fries were decent.  They could have been a tad more crispy.  They were thick logs of hand cut potatoes.  They reminded me of a cross between Five Guys fries and my moms homemade fries.  They needed a little bit of salt too.  They weren't bad, they just weren't that great either.    I will definitely be back for another one of these burgers in the future.  Their other menu offerings looked great too. They also serve breakfast all day.   It's only about a 5 minute drive from my house,  so I guarantee I will eat through some of their menu.

I was on my way home from the Cardinals vs Diamondbacks game, and I was a little bit famished.  I didn't want any fast food, and I also didn't want to go to a diner type place.  I had remembered my friend Liza had written a review of this spot, and I have also had it bookmarked for awhile now.  I figured, now is the time, right?  I decided to head up the 17 North and exit on Dunlap.  Drove down a few blocks, made a left on 19th and this place is about a mile down 19th Ave. on the left.  It's in a U-Haul parking lot. Pretty non descript, but you will find it without a problem if you keep your eye out.  I pulled in the parking lot, approached the cart/dining area and was asked if it was for here, or to go?  I said for here, and the nice young gentlemen told me to grab a seat and that he would be over in a minute.  I decided to go with 2 Sonoran Hot Dogs (no mayo) and a Mandarin Jarritos.  A few minutes later, my dogs were placed in front of me.  Here is how they were...........  Sonoran Hot Dogs-  Right when they were placed down in front of me, I knew they were going to be awesome!  Just on visual appeal alone, these warrant 5 stars!  I noticed that the bun was grilled and had a nice toasty, buttery sheen to it.  The top part of the bun reminded me of a New England split style hot dog bun.  It sure was beautiful.  I took a bite into my dogs and was overwhelmed with joy!  This dog was wrapped with bacon, then topped with ketchup, mustard, avocado sauce?, jalapeno sauce, beans, tomatoes and some cotija cheese sprinkled on top.  Everything just works!  I am not a big fan of pinto beans.  I am not a fan of ketchup on my hot dog...its almost sac religious!  I am not a fan of cheap hot dogs.  I am not the biggest fan of tomatoes.  You know what though?  This hot dog consists of ALL of those ingredients that I normally don't like, but it still tastes like a million bucks!  Something about the combo of flavors makes it work perfectly!  I'm pretty sure that bun is the key!  It is toasty and a bit crunchy, yet pillow soft when you bite in, and deep enough to hold everything in without shit falling out all over the place.  It's a perfect vehicle for this type of dog.  I woofed down my 2 dogs and easily could have gone for another....maybe 2!  These were not only the best Sonoran style dogs I have ever had, these dogs were some of the best "any kind of dogs" I have ever had.  They were awesome.  I almost don't want to try out any other Sonoran dog places in Phoenix because I am afraid I will be let down due to how perfect these were.  Jarritos-  Mandarin Jarritos.  Bomb!  You have to have an OG Mexican Coke or a Jarritos while eating food like this.  Overall, it was $3.00 a dog, and $2.00 for the soda.  $8.00 total for one of the best meals I have had in Phoenix!  They are open late, the guy running the place was friendly, and the dogs were flat out awesome!  Good find, Liza...good find!  I now have a Sonoran dog spot I can recommend, take out of town visitors to, and keep coming back to myself!  Damn, those dogs were good!

Meh...  I have lived in Surprise for over a year now.  There aren't too many "good" (hell, they aren't really ANY "good" restaurants in Surprise) restaurants around these parts.  I live about 2 minutes from Jim's Burgers and Eggs.  My wife went here one time before and she said it was decent.  For whatever reason, today we decided to check it out.    We walked in and I studied the menu board for a minute or so.  The infamous "unfriendly lady at the front counter" was staring at us and finally asked if we knew what we wanted.  My wife asked a question about what comes on the burgers, and the lady shoved a menu in her face, pointed at what comes on them and then read the ingredients off really fast.  She could have either showed us the menu, or just told us...not made a big production like it was a big deal.  Anyways....my wife ordered her burger and asked for it well done.  The lady wrote it down but did not confirm it.  My wife is the type of person who won't eat a burger if there is red or pink in it, so she always orders well done.  I went next and ordered a triple cheeseburger and some onion rings.  When all was said and done, my wife kindly reminded her "well done" and the lady kind of snapped back and said, "Do you want HIS well done too?".  It was a very unpleasant and uncomfortable interaction.  Anyways...2 burgers, fries, onion rings and a soda were $21.00.  Here is how the food was.........  Triple Cheeseburger-  Meh.  It looked better than it tasted.  The first bite in, I got a great charbroiled taste and thought it was going to be fantastic.  Sadly, the charbroiled bites were skimp and I only encountered a few good bites.  The burger patties they use were not that great and they tasted plain as can be (could have used some salt) except around the edges.  The cheese wasn't even fully melted either.  I tried to finish most of it but I just couldn't.  I won't be coming back here for burgers again.  Onion Rings-  Now these things were delicious!  A bit skimp for the price (8 or so rings for $5.00), but they tasted great.    Fries-  Just plain standard fries.  Could have been cooked 20 seconds longer to make them more crispy. My son who LOVES french fries, didn't even eat them.  He took a bite of one and threw it on the floor.  Service after the initial encounter was fine.  The lady who brought us our food was smiling at least and pretty chipper.  They did bring things out in waves though and not all at once.  I got my burger first.  Then the rings came out, then my wifes burger and fries.  It was just a tad odd.   Overall, it wasn't the worst meal I ever had, but it was too pricey for what you got.  I will drive the extra 20 minutes down Bell to Whataburger or to an In N Out.  They are half the price, better quality and both places have much friendlier service.  I really wanted to like this place but sadly I don't think I am ever coming back.

My buddies were rolling out of town and one of them had never been to a Five Guys before.  Time to sample it, right?  Drove down here and had the last supper (lunch) with my boys before they drove home to Vegas.  I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger which I topped with mustard, grilled onions and regular onions.  I ordered a small regular fry and a glass of water.   Total was a tad over $12.00.  A little steep for a burger and fries but would it be worth it?  Today, I would say yes.  The burger was pretty much perfect today. Two patties of juicy beef,  perfectly melted cheese, plenty of onions and a little mustard tied it all together.   The fries are delicious too.  They are cooked proper and they give you a grip of them!  I couldn't even finish a small order.  Two regular sized adults should probably split a small fry.  Service was extremely friendly.  The cashier who took my order seemed genuinely interested in how my day was going and she was all chipper and smiling the whole time taking my order.  When I picked up my food, the guy who called out my number was extremely pleasant too.  That is always good to see.  Seems like a cool place to work.  Overall, I really like Five Guys.  It's just too expensive though.  $12.00 and change for a burger and fries is up there.  If I would have added a soda, that is a $15.00 lunch right there my friends.  If it was closer to $8.00, even $10.00, I think I would come here more often.  I know a craving will hit sooner or later though,  and I will be back.  Five Guys definitely puts out a mighty fine burgers and fries!

Worst McDonalds ever!  Was headed out to San Diego so I decided to stop here in the drive through to get some food.  Horrible!  Should have went somewhere else.......ANYWHERE ELSE!  I placed my order for a McDouble and a 6 piece McNuggets.  I paid the man my money and then sat there.  There were 2 cars ahead of me and they were not moving.  It took 8 minutes for the 2 cars ahead of me to get their food.  That is painstakingly slow for a fast food restaurant.  When the car immediately in front of me did not pull away once she got her food, I knew something was up.  I saw her have to ask for straws, napkins, and salt and pepper packets.  It is now my turn to pull up to the window to get my food.  The lady hands me a bag without any expression at all and says "here you go".  I took my bag and then got on the freeway.  A mile down the road, I open the bag.  No dipping sauce for my McNuggets and no fucking napkins!   I HATE THAT SHIT!  Lazy ass workers who don't do their job.  I was pissed!  The food itself even tasted a bit off.  The burger was luke warm and the McNuggets were rubbery and seemed like they had been sitting out awhile.  For damn sure I will NEVER come back to this McDonalds!   I've never had a problem in 36 years on earth at any McDonalds,  EVER.   This one was fucking horrible!  Avoid at all costs!

So.....my wife saw this place on "Shark Tank" and she wanted to try it.  She is a picky eater and usually will not eat sushi or anything like that (she is pretty much anti fish stuff).  She read that they will make a roll with chicken in it so we decided to come here after my burger.  I was pretty full from my burger but I asked myself, "Tim...when are you ever going to eat sushi in Phoenix again"?  I answered myself, "Probably never".  Might as well order a roll. This place is like an assembly line of sushi ordering.  You tell them what you want in it, they put it in, roll it, cut it up and serve it to you.  Very fast and efficient.   So here is what I got................  I went with a seaweed wrapper with white rice.  To that I added avocado, green onion, jalapeno and shrimp.  They will usually drizzle a sauce on top but I decided to get mine on the side in a cup.  I went with the sweet chili sauce.  My wife got seaweed wrapper, white rice, cucumber, avocado and chicken.  She got hers drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  Total for 2 rolls was just over $13.00.  My roll was very good!  I'm not a big sushi fan and if I eat it, I will usually puss out and get California rolls and stuff like that.  My combo of shrimp, avocado, green onion and jalapeno was a winner though.  The avocado made it creamy, the green onion made it fresh, the jalapeno made it spicy, the shrimp made it cool and the sweet chili sauce made it hot.  I don't know if I could have picked a better combo for my things.  My wife absolutely loved hers.  It was exactly what she expected and she says it was a 5 star joint in her book.  Service was friendly and efficient!  I would definitely go back again if they ever made one in San Diego.

I was excited when I saw this place.  They had just opened up this type of car wash in Santee before I moved.  I went with the $5.99 wash.  You pull up, put your wheels in the track and then shift your car to neutral.  You then sit back and enjoy the 3-5 minute wash.  They have awesome free vacuums too.  The attachments are really skinny so you can get into most places of your car.  They even have upright floor mat holders so you can get those cleaned easily too.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the car wash still doesn't get all the junk off your car.  It gets most, but not all.  For the $5.99 though, with free vacuum, this will be my car wash of choice going forward.

4.5 stars.  Right when we pulled up and parked you could smell the smoke.  We parked right in front of where they load the wood into their smokers.  It was a good sight to see.  Looked like we were in for some great BBQ.  We got in line and I was in awe of the big smokers they have behind the counter.  When you order your stuff, they pull it out of the smoker and cut it fresh for you and weigh it right in front of you on a scale.  They then place it on butcher paper and into a milk carton type tray.  I couldn't wait to try it!  We were in for some grub!  There was no line either (probably due to Easter) at almost noon which was a score!   One of my coworkers used to work at a Rudys in Texas many years ago and he recommended I get a few things....  Pork ribs, creamed corn and a loaded baked potato with meat.  We got that and a whole bunch more too ;-).  We got 1/4 pound lean brisket, 1/4 pound smoked turkey, 3 pork ribs, 3 baby back ribs, a half chicken, a loaded baked potato with brisket on top, some creamed corn and some drinks. They also give you slices of white/wheat bread for free so you can make sandwiches out of your meat.  Total came out to $35.00.  Here is how the food stacked up..................  Pork Ribs- These things were fantastic.  They had a fantastic bark on them.  Almost looked burnt but they weren't.  They tasted great and had a strong pepper/smoke flavor to them.  I liked them a lot and my friend wasn't lying when he recommended them.  They were awesome!  Baby Back Ribs-  These were great too.  Not as blackened as the pork ribs but still seasoned well.  The meat came off the bone with just a little tug.  Damn they were good!  Smoked Turkey-  Delicious!  It had the perfect amount of smoke flavor but was still pretty moist and not dried out.  My best friend is a turkey lover (he ordered turkey every chance he could on our KC/Memphis trip a few years back).  He would have loved this stuff.  It was great!  Lean Brisket-  I'm usually not a big brisket fan but this stuff was legit.  You could see the straight up smoke ring around the edge of the meat.  It was tender and delicious.  I don't know if I have ever had better brisket.  I would definitely get it again.  Loaded Baked Potato-  They give you a softball sized baked potato and top it with a ton of butter, cheese, sour cream (we skipped the sour cream) and your choice of meat.  We got brisket on it and unlike the slices of brisket they give you when you order brisket on its own, this stuff was almost like burnt ends chunked brisket.  Tasted great!  Half Chicken-  This is the only thing we didn't really like.  We picked at it a bit and it had a great smoked flavor but we were so full from everything else that we tossed most of it.  Wouldn't get it again.  Creamed Corn-  This was just ok.  I like corn but usually when its corn on the cob.  Plain corn I will eat but I'm not the biggest fan.  This corn tasted like frozen corn you can buy and then they creamed it up.  Its almost like a gravy of sorts.  I probably would not get it again.  We tossed most of it.  Coke products in the fountain drinks.  They had a grip of bottled drinks/beer in huge metal tubs of ice too.  It was cool to see.  My wife got a root beer in a bottle and liked it.  Service was friendly.  They did forget to give me my potato at first but then when we brought it to their attention they got on top of it right away and brought it out to our table.  Total of $35.00 for the giant crate of food we got was well worth it IMO.    This was some of the best BBQ I have had in a long long time.  It reminded me of me and my buddies trip to KC and Memphis a few years back.  The smoked meats are delicious and I would come back often if I lived out here.  Don't even ask me how their BBQ sauce tasted.......I didn't try it.  The meat was so damn good it didn't need any.  That's a winner folks!  Legit Texas BBQ at its finest!

I have to give it to the state of AZ.  They have a lot of Midwest type establishments because of all the transplants.  That is fine by me.  Jimmy Johns started in Illinois, and now they are all over the dang place.  Anyways......I decided to come to this Jimmy Johns for lunch today.  I went with the JJ Gargantuan (no mayo) and a chocolate chip cookie.  Total was right around $10.00 and I was out the door.  Here is how everything was...........  JJ Gargantuan-  This beast was heavy!  The sandwich has a mix of genoa salami, ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey and provolone cheese.  It is topped with the usual sub toppings like lettuce, onions, tomatoes and oil and vinegar.  They stuff all of this between a French type loaf of bread. It was very sturdy, yet pliable when you bit in.  Its a perfect style loaf to support all these toppings!   It's only about 8 inches long (that's what she said!), but its so stuffed to the gills, it's almost hard to eat.  You either have to unhinge your jaw, or have to kind of take a bite from the top, then the bottom and make your way along like that.  Great mix of flavors though!  Not sure if you could get a better sandwich from here.  I've only been  to Jimmy John's a few times, but every single time, I have gotten this particular sandwich and will continue to do so.  Don't stray from a winner, right?  Chocolate Chip Cookie-  Not sure if I was just craving something sweet, or what, but this was one of the best damn chocolate chip cookies I have had in awhile!  They are $1.50 each, but they are huge and worth every penny.  They were soft enough to enjoy, but not mushy.  They also weren't really "crisp" per say, kind of a middle ground of texture.  You could tell that these things were loaded with butter (the secret to great cookies!) and every bite was sensational.  I could seriously see myself coming here and buying a couple of cookies on their own.  By far the best cookie I have had from a sandwich shop...and its not even close!  These were great!  Jimmy John's is just a tad more pricey than other "fast food" sandwich places, but the quality and sheer amount of ingredients they pile on their sandwiches make it worth paying the extra couple of bucks. This place is right up the street from work and I'm sure I will be back often whenever a sandwich craving hits.

"Man, Tim....another pizza review?"  Yup.  I had this place bookmarked for quite some time.  When I first moved down here to Phoenix, I had gone to the Isa's down on Bell Rd.  I thought it was decent, but it was too far away for me to come back regularly.  I saw that they had another branch located closer to work so I decided to come down today to check it out.    I walked in and was intrigued by the sign of "2 slices and a drink for $5.00" sign.  That is a smoking good deal!  I was browsing the slice selection and it was a little bit skimp.  There were single slices remaining on most of the pizzas and then a half of a Hawaiian pie left.  I decided to go with 2 slices of that and a drink.  I guess that the Hawaiian is a "specialty" pie or something, because my total was $6.50 instead of $5.00.  Still a good deal IMO.  The lady behind the counter was incredibly friendly and nice!  I paid her my money and she said she would bring my pizza out to me.  I grabbed my drink (Coke products) and sat down.  This place is a tad small and tight...there were other people eating and you kind of had to squeeze and slide around the tables as to not bump into them.  I think my large derriere actually hit some chicks chair.  My bad!  Anyways, here is how everything was...............  Hawaiian Pizza-  The lady placed these slices in front of me and they looked and smelled great!  These slices are HUGE.  They were piping hot and fresh out of the oven.  I took a bite and was impressed.  The bottom crust was crisp, the cheese was melted perfect, and the toppings were plentiful!  I was pressed on time so I had to scarf them down pretty quick!  The slices were so hot, I ate most of them with my fork.  I picked up the crust though and enjoyed that.  The end crust was a little bit too dry and not as chewy as I prefer, but it was still good and fit this type of pizza very well.  Overall, I liked it a lot.  I got there at a bad time (2:30pm) so they didn't have a wide variety to choose from, but to their credit, on the way out, they were pulling fresh pies out of the oven to restock their supply.  For a straight up slice spot, I think this might be the best place around in/near Deer Valley.  I know I will definitely be back to try out some of their other kinds of pizza!  Can't beat the value and customer service either!  Good stuff!

We stopped here on our way down to the airport.  Easy to get to, right off the freeway.  I had been to other Culver's before, but usually just stop for a Turtle Sundae (The best!).  Tonight I went with some food.  I ordered the Culver's double butter burger meal and upgraded to cheese curds.  I had their own root beer to drink.  Here is how it the food was.............  Double Butterburger-  Solid!  Reminded me of a Smashburger.  Semi thin patties, cooked on a flat top so you get a nice little outside crunch.  Very juicy and delicious.  I got it with only onions and cheese.  I would get one again.  Cheese Curds-  Deep fried nuggets of cheese?  I'm listening!  These things were great!  They had a nice exterior batter on them that was seasoned well.  The taste of the batter reminded me of Carls Jrs fried zucchini....same flavor.  I could have eaten way more of those little nuggets of gold.  Me and my brother split a Turtle Sundae for dessert.  This location didn't hook up the toasted pecans as well as the spot by my house in Surprise, but it was still a delicious sundae!  I always have to get one of these whenever I am here.  Service was awesome!  The cashier was really friendly and patient.  She even cracked some jokes when she came out to the dining room to deliver our food.  Good times!  Overall, I will be back.  Maybe not to this one (I have one down the street in Surprise), but Culver's is definitely fine by me.  Solid food and great custard make this a 4 star joint!

I've been here probably 100 times since I moved to Surprise.  Can't believe I have not written a review for it.  This Walmart is solid!  I will list the reasons why, below..........  1.  Super close to the house.  Walking distance if need be!  4 minute car ride.  Like right down the street...I can almost see it from my house. 2.  Prices.  Whether you like Walmart or not, you can't argue about their low prices.  For a family on a single income, this is more important than all the other "reasons" why people don't shop at Walmart.   3.  This particular Walmart is the first one I have ever been in that is not sketchy.  There are 2 other Walmarts in Surprise (Grand/Bell and El Mirage), that are semi sketch and have a certain type of clientele that shop there.  I'm sure you have heard of or seen the "People of Walmart" website.  I am happy to say that I have never seen anyone at this Walmart that would "qualify" to be on that website. This one is new, clean, and attracts normal folks unlike some/a lot of other Walmarts I have been in ;-). 4.  Friendly staff!  There are a few folks in particular that work here that provide excellent service.  They remember your face and are genuinely pretty friendly.  I have yet to have a bad encounter with a Walmart associate (At this store, at least.). 5.  McDonalds inside.  I'm not the biggest fan of the Golden Arches, but every now and then, its convenient to grab a soft serve cone or an order of fries for my son to munch on while we are shopping. 6.  Propane Exchange.  They have a register in the garden center located near the propane tanks.  They have the cheapest refill prices I have found, and the process only takes about 5 minutes to pay for and exchange your old tank for a new one.    The only semi complaint I have ever had here is the occasional wait to check out.  Most days are fine, but some days it seems like they are short staffed on cashiers and it takes a little while to check out.  All things considered though, this Walmart is by far the best one I have ever stepped foot into, and I will continue to come back.

Meh.  After a dinner at Macayos, we decided to come down here.  My wife had some money left on a gift card and we were in the mood for something sweet.  This place is located right next to the only movie theater in Surprise.  We walked in and scanned over the options.  I wanted to order their "Churro Caramel Crave" but they said that it would be about 6 to 7 minutes to prepare.  I then attempted to order a "Brownie a la Coldstone" but once again, said it would be 6 to 7 minutes.  I guess they have to go pull off a Betty Crocker and whip up a batch of brownies/churros behind the scenes.  I really didn't want to wait (it's that instant gratification thing ;-) lol) for my ice cream so I decided to just go with a "Founders Favorite" which included sweet cream ice cream, pecans, brownie pieces, fudge and caramel".  My wife got a "Peanut Butter Perfection" in a waffle cone.  Here is how they were..............  Founders Favorite-  It was decent.  It was melting kind of fast so I had to whoof it down.  The ice cream was just alright..not that great of quality. The brownie pieces were really good...nice and chewy and fudgy.  The nuts, fudge and caramel all kind of blended together.  It was plenty sweet, but I was not that impressed.  My wife said the same thing about hers.  She actually didn't even finish all of hers, and that is rare for a peanut butter type ice cream.  Overall, I think it was a bit too expensive for what you get.  Our ice creams were $15.00!  For that price, I would rather get a sundae at Culvers, Baskin Robbins, or even buy a few pints of good ice cream and eat it at home.  Service was just ok.  They were going through the motions.  Seemed like they didn't want to be there kind of.  I probably wont come back unless its totally free with a gift card or something.  Just not worth it!

We went to see my moms Aunt Irene today, but before we did, we decided to grab some lunch here at Federal Pizza.  I had signed up for their email club a few weeks ago and one of the perks of joining is a free pizza!  Score!  When I first walked through the doors, I thought they weren't going to let me in.  I didn't have any facial hair, tattoos, a cool hair style, nice clothes and the fact that I arrived in a car instead of a fixie bike, exposed me even more.  (If you didn't know already, I'm not the biggest fan of hipsters...anyways...this is home base for them).  The hostess was super nice though and showed me and my mom to a booth in the center of the joint.  I ordered a Coke and we showed our waitress my free pizza email on my phone.  She wrote down some number and that was that.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a meatball sandwich to split.  About 10 minutes later, our food had arrived.  Here is how it was.......................  Pepperoni Pizza ($12.00 normally but free with email club signup) -  Simple and delicious.  As per the menu description, "Molinari Pepperoni + Federal Cheese Blend + Red Sauce".  The pizza was a little bit "wet".  Just a tad soggy in the middle.  You could still pick it up and fold it if you were careful, but it was pretty droopy.  The pepperoni was in large slices and tasted awesome.  I really dug their "cheese blend" too.  It was delicious.  Nice and creamy and very flavorful.  The dough/crust  tasted fine except that it was a little bit too soft for my liking.  It was pretty "bready".  Overall it was a good, but not great pizza.  Can't complain about a free pizza though.  Would I come back and buy this pizza?  Probably,  but if I am driving somewhere for pizza, there are a few other places I would head to first.  Meatball Sandwich ($10.00) -  This thing was delicious!  As per the menu description, "Three Meatballs + House Mozz + Pomodoro + Basil + Wood Roasted Onions".  I really liked this sandwich.  The meatballs were tender, the sauce was delicious, the cheese was melted nicely and the wood fired onions gave it a great "bite".  The bread they use is fantastic too.  Not sure if it is their pizza dough or not but whatever it is, it was great.  It was nice and toasty and held together well.  It was served with a little side salad too.  I didn't touch that because I am allergic to vegetables, but I would definitely get this sandwich again.  Service was really friendly.  They weren't around much but they had smiles on their faces and brought me a drink refill without having to ask for it which was cool.    Not sure if I will seek this place out again, but the sandwich was great and the pizza was pretty good.  If I was with some hipster buddies...wait...I don't have any hipster buddies......but if I did, and they wanted to come here, I would probably accompany them and get something to eat.

Taco Bell....where you have about 5 core ingredients, that can be transformed into about 30 different menu items!  You know what though, I crave it more than you would think!  I'm a huge fan of their regular crunchy tacos, double decker tacos,  as well as their plain nachos.  Something about that molten lava cheese sauce and their salty and slightly sweet tortilla chips.  I always have to get an order, sometimes two, whenever I get food here.  Prices are pretty low (they have gone up quite a bit from years past though.  I still remember $.59 cent tacos...they are now like $1.29), and you can still get a decent and filling meal for between $5.00-$7.00.  Service at this location is always friendly and there is never a long wait in the drive thru.  It's the closest one to my house and one of the more consistent Taco Bells I have been to.  I will continue to make a "run for the border" whenever a fast food taco craving hits.

My buddy Dave G. recently wrote an updated review on Portillos.  There are like a gazillion transplants from Chicago out here in AZ, so they have 2 of them.  After reading his review, it made me realize that the last time I was there (Buena Park), I left a bit disappointed.  I wanted to go see a movie that was close by, so I decided to stop and get some lunch.  Redemption?  Yes!  I got there early at like 10:40am.  There were maybe 5 other people in the joint.  I walked up and placed my order for a Jumbo Dog with mustard, onions and relish, a Maxwell Street Polish, a Large Cheese Fries, and a Large Diet Coke.  My total was just under $12.00.  Not the cheapest lunch, but it was substantial and kept me full most of the day.  I paid the lady my money and then took a seat.  A few minutes later, they called my number and I picked up my order.  Here is how everything tasted...............  Jumbo Hot Dog-  Delicious!  I didn't go full Chicago style on this one.  I'm not the biggest fan of tons of toppings.  Mustard, onion and sometimes relish and I am a happy man.  This dog was great!  It was large, plump and beefy!  It was encased in a soft, steamed poppyseed bun and then topped with mustard, onions and plenty of neon green relish.  I really liked the dog and for the .34 cents more than a regular dog, it is well worth going with the jumbo.  Pretty much a must order every time here.  Maxwell Street Polish-  The last time I had this I was extremely disappointed.  The onions were too watery, the bun was soggy and the sausage didn't taste that great.  This time around it was better than last time, but not as good as it could have been. The caramelized onions they use are plentiful, but they destroy the bun.  They soften it up too fast.  The Polish sausage itself was a bit lacking too.  It wasn't that flavorful and had a weird texture.  They skimped on the mustard too.  I ate the whole thing and it wasn't "bad" per say, but give me a Teds Polish any day of the week over this thing.  I doubt I will order it again.  I would get 2 Jumbo Dogs instead.  Large Cheese Fries-  These are probably my favorite thing here!  Whatever it is, their cheese sauce is just fantastic.  Its piping hot, creamy and it sticks to the fries perfectly.  They use a crinkle cut fry here and they are fried and salted nicely.  A quick dunk in the molten cheese and you have yourself a winner.  Their fries are in the same pricing scheme as their dogs.  A small fry is only like .20 cents less than a large.  Why even get a small?  For .20, you get way more fries.  The cashier was friendly and the guy that gave me my food was cheery.  They still aren't my favorite hot dog in AZ (Teds holds a special place in my heart), but a jumbo dog and some cheese fries are a guaranteed winner!  This visit redeemed my faith in Portillos and I'm sure I will be back soon enough!   Thanks for planting the seed, Dave G ;-)

So...I had been to a couple of different Freddy's throughout the Phoenix area, but had never been to this one.  This one is the closest one to my house, and I decided to come here for lunch.  I saw an advertisement for a green chile burger, and also that they had fried pickles as a side.  Sign me up!  Drove down to the drive thru and placed my order of a green chile burger combo with fried pickles as my side and a Mountain Dew to drink.  Here is how everything was...........  Green Chile Burger-  Freddy's uses the "smush" technique for their burgers.  They squash them down really flat with the spatula so the edges get nice and crispy and hang over the edge of the bun.  My burger came with two 2oz patties, some nice grilled onions, some mustard, cheese and a fair amount of green chiles.  The taste was very good.  The cheese was melted perfectly, the onions and green chiles were nice and pliable/soft and the patties tasted fine.  Maybe not the best green chile burger I have ever had, but for a fast food type place, it was pretty solid.  Fried Pickles-  These things were great!  They were little pickle chips, breaded and deep fried.  They had a great crunchy batter on them and were delicious!  I would definitely get them again!  Service in the drive thru was great!  The lady who took my order was extremely chipper and happy, and the guy that handed me my food was all smiles and thanked me for coming in (it was sincere, too...I can spot a bullshit reaction from miles away).  It was a good change of pace compared to other burger type spots, and I'm sure I will be back at some point in the future.

4.5 stars!  My brother in law and his friend helped me unload my U Haul truck.....had to take care of them somehow and we decided to come here for dinner.  I was pretty impressed!  We were seated in a comfortable booth, placed our order for drinks and then were served some of their honey wheat bread (really good) and with butter.  I decided to go with the "Outlaw Ribeye" for my meal.  This came with salad and a side. I chose their chopped salad and fries for my side.   My brother in laws friend got the same thing and my brother in law went with an 11 ounce sirloin.  My brother in law also decided to get a "Wild West Shrimp" appetizer for us to share.  Here is how everything tasted................  Wild West Shrimp-  This was great!  It was popcorn shrimp with chopped up peppers served with a dipping sauce.  The shrimp were fried perfectly, the peppers added a little kick and the ranch dipping sauce was great too!  The serving size was pretty large too.  It fed all 3 of us and was a great choice by my brother in law.  Wedge Salad-  Pretty decent sized salad.  Lettuce, tomatoes, onions, blue cheese, bacon.  It was tasty!  Outlaw Ribeye-  This thing was a nice sized steak.  18 ounces, I believe.  It was cooked perfect the way I ordered it (medium).  Juicy, fatty (in a good way), and seasoned well.  It was a great steak!  French Fries-  These were the only things I was not totally impressed with.  Standard fries with seasoned salt.  They were just ok.  Total after tip and everything was $130.00.  Not bad for 3 full sized meals, an appetizer and a few Jack and Cokes.  Service was awesome and overall it was a great meal.  I will definitely take my wife here once she moves out.  This dinner was excellent!

Outside of NYC (and maybe New Haven, CT), Phoenix may have the best overall pizza scene of anywhere in the US that I have been to before.  I keep finding excellent pizza joints and am loving every minute of it!  I decided to head down this way today and try out Pomo.  The reviews looked great, and it was one that I had bookmarked too.  Win, win.  I drove down, parked in the lot next to it ($2.00 an hour) and walked over.  I was the first person in the joint at about 11:30am.  I was greeted by the hostess and asked where I wanted to sit.  It was nice out, so I decided to sit out on the patio.  I had a water to drink and then I placed my order for a Regina Margherita.  The first time at a new pizza spot,  I always go with a plain cheese pizza.  If their plain cheese pizza is good, you know the rest of their stuff is going to be good!  Here is how it was..............  Regina Margherita Pizza ($11.95)-  This pizza looked great!  I'm becoming a huge fan of the Napoletana style pizza.  Wood fired oven, cooked quick (less than 2 minutes usually) and it makes one hell of a tasty pizza.  This pizza was simple and delicious.   Right away I noticed that it had plenty of cheese.  My first bite in, I tasted one of the creamiest cheeses I have ever had.  It was great!  The sauce was nice and mellow, the basil was fragrant and delicious and the crust was fantastic!  The bottom of the crust was nice and charred and blistered.  The crust around the edges was charred nicely yet still soft and chewy.  The middle was just a tad soggy (it's normal with these type of pizzas) but I could still pick it up, fold a slice and eat it.  No knife and fork needed.  I devoured that pizza in record time.  It was absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to try out some of their other offerings.    When I was done with my meal, the pizza cook? brought out a plate of complimentary fried dough with powdered sugar.  It was a fitting ending to the meal.  The little strips of dough reminded me of fried won tons.  They were light and delicate and just sweet enough from the powdered sugar.  Nice gesture and it was appreciated!  I only have two things bad to say about this place....both of them were based on the fact that I sat outside.  There were quite a few flies.  Understandable because I am outside, but there were more than normal.  Maybe get some fly traps or supersonic bug zappers or something.  The only other slight gripe is that if you sit outside, there is a bar next door.  People were smoking out there and the smoke blew downwind over towards my way.  No fault of Pomos, just a heads up.  If you don't appreciate smoke, I would sit inside just in case.  Service was great and every employee I encountered had a smile on their face!  If I am downtown, I know where to come for some great pizza!   It was fantastic and I left very full and very impressed!  I will definitely be back!

I've parked here overnight a few times.  This trip, I grabbed a spot right up front near the escalators up to the sky train.  Score!  Parking was $9.00 a day.  Got there around 8pm on Wed night and left Sun night around 9pm....$36.00.  Not bad, not bad at all.  A taxi to my house in Surprise would have been $75 or more so I  definitely see the value in parking here.  Well lit, safe, affordable.  I will use this lot anytime I fly out for a few days.

My buddy and I went to Grimaldis for lunch and then decided to stop by here for a drink.  We got there around noon and there were only a few people in the joint. The place is pretty freaking big.  Lots of space to roam and mingle.  We sat at the bar and hung out for a bit.  We had a really friendly and easy going (both in personality AND on the eyes) bartender that we chatted up.  She told us that later on that night, it was "Ladies Night" and that drinks were 50 cents for ladies and $1.00 for guys during certain hours.  Not bad.  We decided to come back later that night to check it out.  Here is how that went down..............  10:00pm-  We arrived and were semi patted down and paid our $5.00 cover charge.  They slap a wristband on you and then we grabbed a table.  Tons of people were here.  Definitely a younger (college) crowd.  I felt old and kept reminding myself that I was probably a sophomore in high school when most of these spring chickens were born.  Scary thought, I know!  We hung out for a bit and watched some people dance.  About every 20 minutes, the DJ would play some certain song and people would line up and bust out their moves in a group line dance type deal.  They had one song they played (Didn't know the name of it..sorry) where people are just kicking their feet and doing the slide or whatever it was called.  All of a sudden, there is one point in the song where the beat just dropped...PANDAFUCKINGMODIUM!  People started dancing faster and kicking their legs higher and spinning as fast as a tornado etc.  It was NUTS!  My buddy compared it to the Harlem Shake.  Once that beat dropped.......all hell broke loose!  It was definitely a sight to see.  We chilled for about an hour and then decided to bail.  Not sure on why this place gets a 2 star average.  Every person we encountered there was friendly and service was excellent both time frames we went.  I would definitely come back and I think my wife and her girlfriends would enjoy this place too.

Chick-Fil-A.  Also known as "Billy's favorite restaurant!".  My kid loves this damn place!  He is a pretty picky eater, but he will eat some nuggets and waffle fries any day of the week!    We were down at Children's Hospital getting a X-Ray, and I decided to take my son here for some lunch.  It was only a few blocks away, and I knew he would love it.  It was a little busy in the parking lot (Close to 12 Noon), but we found a spot and headed on in.    As soon as we got in the place, we were welcomed by the friendly cashier.  I placed our order for a #5 Combo and I got myself a chicken sandwich, too.  Paid the man my money and when I was asking for my sauces, he even recommended his own favorite (Honey BBQ) sauce and told me how good it was.  I took him up on his offer (turns out it is pretty tasty!), grabbed my plastic table marker and was about to go grab a seat.  Here is where this place gets 5 stars......  Before we could even sit down, there was a lady coming out with our food on the tray.  Literally, one minute after I placed the order, our food was ready!  She saw I had my son in tow, so she offered to take our food to the table for us.  I got up to get a high chair and she even offered to get that for me!  I got us all set up and one of the workers there came up to say hi to my son.  Billy is a bit shy at first, but he eventually gave her a high five.  She came back a few minutes later with a toy!  It was a little stuffed cow!  I was incredibly impressed with their hospitality and generosity.    Chick-Fil-A always has nice workers and great service, but this place went above and beyond!  Every person I encountered was awesome!  The food tasted great as usual, too!  I will definitely head back here anytime we are down near Camelback and 16th!

4.5 Stars  Me and my coworker were talking about pizza the other day and this place came up.  I looked it up online and it looked familiar to some other places I had been to.  Same concept at least.  I was super excited to try it out.  The fellas (and one lady) decided to come here for lunch today.  We chose a bad time to come (12:00 noon) and the line was about 25 people deep.  We had planned to eat it here but ran out of time so we got it to go.  I placed my order for a Steak & Blue.  My total was a little over $8.00.  Paid the woman my money and waited for my pizza.  Here is how it was...............  Steak & Blue-  WOW!  This thing was fantastic!  I'm usually a simple type guy when it comes to pizza.  Pepperoni or plain cheese suits me well.  While I was standing in line, the Steak & Blue sounded way too good to pass up though.  I couldn't have picked a better pizza!  They start by brushing oil and garlic on their pizza crust.  They then load this thing up with mozzarella cheese, pieces of steak, onions, mushrooms, peppers and gorgonzola (the blue!).  They throw it in this huge oven and a few minutes later it is done.  The flavors on this thing are out of this world!  The crust stayed perfectly sturdy and crisp even after a short drive.  The first bite in, I knew I had a winner!  It was basically like eating a cheesesteak pizza.  It was damn tasty.  All the ingredients were fresh and blended together very well.  I will be back to get this pizza again.  The line was the only thing that sucked......not their fault though.  If you came here during off peak hours, you would have your food in 5 minutes.  Service was friendly and the pizza was delicious.  This is the best kind of "make your own pizza" type restaurants that I have ever been to.  I am glad its only a 5 minute ride from work!

It's been over a year since my last review of Fired Pie, so I thought I would do an update.  The awesome part is, that nothing has changed, and some things have even improved!  Fired Pie is by far the best of these type of pizza places.  It is close to my work and I have probably been in there 20+ times in the last year.  Every single time, every employee is courteous, friendly and they will hook up your pizza any way you want.  If you want a grip of one particular topping, just tell them and they will hook you up.  Always delivered with a smile and always very fast.  If there is no line, you are in and out of there in under 10 minutes.   Now, onto the food..... Pizza.....I can eat it every day!  I wish I DID eat it every day.  I would be happy as hell.  Anyways, the best part about Fired Pie (at least compared to other pizza places similar) is the consistency!  Their dough is perfect!  No matter how much you pile on your pizza, their crust holds up.  You can pick up a slice and not worry about shit falling all over the place.  I can't say the same with other pizza spots! All their toppings are super fresh and their crust gets a nice char on the bottom and the edges.  It's absolutely delicious!   My usual order consists of red sauce, mozzarella cheese, tons of meatballs, some pepperoni, some spinach, some red onions, a grip of garlic and I get that all cooked "well done".    I really cant say enough about this place.  It is hands down my favorite lunch spot around work and I will continue to come back.  Now, if they can build one of these out in Surprise....take my money, take my money!

4.5 Stars.  Tempe=Hot Dog Paradise!  3 great hot dog joints all within 5 miles of each other.  Decisions, decisions!  How would Detroit Coney Grill stack up?  Pretty damn well as you are about to find out!  I had driven by this place a few times but was always on my way down the street to Ted's.  When I woke up this morning, I was craving a hot dog (Twice in less than a week).  I decided to drive on down and see what Detroit Coney Grill was all about.  I had never had a "Coney Dog" before today either.  I was browsing their website and noticed that they had a Wednesday special which was 2 Coney Dogs, Fries and a Fountain Drink for $8.88.  Sounded like a plan.  I drove down, parked and walked in.  Right when I walked in, I was greeted by a couple of the workers.  I also noticed that the owner (one of the owners?) was behind the counter talking with the staff and shootin the shit.  I went up to the register and placed my order for the Wednesday Special.  My total was $9.40.  I paid the lady my money, grabbed my cup for my drink and was on the way over to the Coke machine.  While I was making my way over to get my drink, the owner guy walked up to me, asked me how I was doing and shook my hand.  I thought that was really cool and it shows that he appreciates his customers!  I grabbed my soda from the awesome Freestyle Coke Machine and took a seat.  While I was sitting there, I noticed that the owner was talking shop with every single customer in the joint.  He was explaining how they grind their own beef for their burgers, make their own chili, giving recommendations to customers etc etc.  Really personable dude!  A few minutes later, my number was called and I grabbed my stuff.  Here is how it was................  Coney Dogs-  These dogs come topped with their homemade Coney Sauce aka chili, onions and mustard.  This chili is ladled on top of a natural casing dog and nestled inside of a steamed hot dog bun.  The chili kind of reminded me of a Tommy's type chili (CA folks know what I'm talking about).  It had plenty of spices in it and had a great flavor and texture.  I really enjoyed it!  The mustard and onions worked well too and the bun was super soft.  Great snap to the dogs, too!  These 2 dogs were mighty fine!  Fries-  Fresh cut fries!  They were salted perfect, fried perfect and flat out some of the best hand cut fries I have had in quite some time.  Decent sized portion, too!  After I was done with my meal, I was going back to the Coke machine to get a refill for the road.  I ran into the owner again and he asked me how everything was and gave me a fist bump.  I can't remember a time when I received such great customer service at a place...seriously!   I will be back just because of that!  Great dogs, great fries and amazing hospitality make this a joint I can definitely see myself coming back to eventually.

If there is a "good" pizza place in Phoenix, you know damn well that I will eventually try it out.  The Nook had been on my bookmarked list for awhile now, I just never am down in this area though.  I watched a movie downtown mid afternoon, and wanted to eat somewhere semi nearby to avoid some traffic.  Bookmark removed...The Nook,  it was!  I drove down, parked, walked inside, and was directed to a seat at the bar.  As soon as I sat down, the bartender poured me a glass of ice water.  I LOVE when that happens.  She didn't ask, she just offered it up!  Great service from the get go!  I browsed over the menu and decided to go with the Giardino Pizza.  Sitting at the bar was nice!  They have 2 big screens that were showing basketball, plus, you get a front row seat of watching the guys make pizza.  They have their pizza station and oven at one end of the bar.  It helped pass the time.  About 10 minutes later, my pizza was presented in front of me.  Here is how it was.............  The Giardino-  This pizza has house pulled mozzarella, parmesan, spinach, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, basil and extra virgin olive oil.  I am usually anti vegetable (I rarely eat them alone), but for whatever reason, I have come across some great veggie pizzas here in Phoenix, and this one sounded very good and I decided to check it out.    The pizza was placed in front of me and I noticed that it was larger than most "individual" pizzas served at most places.  It was cut into 8 nice sized slices.  I picked up a piece and took a bite and was pretty darn impressed.  The crust held up and didn't flop over, so I folded my piece and ate it pretty quick.  All those veggies combined for some great flavor.  The only particular veggie that could have been better was maybe the onions.  I prefer a red/raw type onion on my pizza.  These caramelized ones were a bit too soft and threw a different flavor profile in the mix.  It would have been a better pizza with red onions.  All the other veggies were great though!  It had tons of mushrooms, lots of soft roasted tomatoes, decent amount of spinach, just enough garlic and mozzarella and a nice sprinkling of pamesan.  These were all laid upon a thin crust dough with an outer crust that had just enough thickness and chew to it.  It was a very good pizza!  Service was very friendly and attentive, but not overbearing.  The pizza was $14.00 which was fair.  I will definitely be back because I want to try out their Calabrese Pizza.  The atmosphere was cozy and chill.  There were other solo diners at the bar, so I didn't feel out of place eating by myself.  It was a cool spot and I will be back soon!

Meh....meh, minus 1 star = 1 star!   My buddy and his family were in town, and we were planning on going to Grimaldis (He has never been).  Unfortunately, his daughter came down with some illness and was not about to leave the house.  Grimaldis was cancelled :-(  We were still in the mood for pizza though, and decided to hit up Papa John's.  It had been years since I have had any Papa John's, and there aren't a whole lot of great pizza options in Surprise.  Papa John's had a special running for a large, up to 5 topping pizza for $9.99.  Not a bad price at all.  I decided to place my order online.  About that.............  I went on their website and and was playing around with different topping combos etc.  I had 2 pizzas in "my cart" but wanted to change them.  I clicked on "edit" and then made the changes I wanted to them and thought everything was good.  I placed my order, drove down, walked in and grabbed my pizzas.  While there, the guy read off what my pizzas were, and they sounded a bit off.  I'm not one to complain unless something is super fucked up, and these orders were not.  What had happened though, is that when I went in to "edit" my pizzas online, what it really did was add those changes ON TOP of what I already had on the pizzas.  So my intent was one plain pepperoni pizza, and one with pepperoni, sausage, onions and mushrooms.  What I got was a double pepperoni, onion, mushroom pizza and a pepperoni, sausage, onion, green pepper and mushroom pizza.  I like all those toppings, so I didn't bitch.  Took the pizzas home and dug in.  Here is how they were.........  Pizzas-  Meh.  First of all, they looked kind of sad.  The dough was incredibly thick and pretty white.  The pizza looked like it could have been cooked a few minutes longer to brown up the cheese, and crisp up the crust.  I took a bite in and was disappointed.  While I mostly agree with the saying, "There is no bad pizza.", this pizza was just not good.  It was probably the worst pizza I have had in AZ.  The crust was so thick and plain and dry, it was nasty.  The cheese and ingredients weren't tasty either.  I ate 3 slices (I was starving, too) and could not eat any more.  Nobody else really liked it either.  We even saved 5 or 6 slices from the pizzas, and they are STILL sitting in my fridge.  Yeah...that bad.  Pizza never makes it past a day in our house, but this is going on 3 days now.  Meh!  The employee at the pickup counter was friendly.  That is about the only good thing I can say about this dinner.  $20.00 for 2 pizzas is not bad at all, but the quality and taste was so bad, I would rather chow down on some Little Caesars!  Yeah....that bad!  I'm never coming back.

So........my mom is in town and I have been telling her about all the amazing pizza joints that I have been to since moving to Phoenix.  She is always down for some pizza so we decided to get some tonight.  We were going to go to the OG one in Glendale but its "Christmas Light Season" so I heard that they are always slammed and waits can be a bitch.  I figured that this one wouldn't be crowded so we drove downtown to try it out.  We found parking right out in front.  You are supposed to pay at the little kiosk thing but my mom is an old, hobbled soul who can't walk...aka, handicapped plates!  Score!   The place was easy enough to find.  It's not in a super duper obvious spot but it's right in the heart of downtown about a block or so from the stadiums etc.  We walked in and were seated by a table at the window. We placed our order for 2 Cokes ($3.00, liter of Mexican Coke in a bottle), a Pizza Fritte aka Calzone and a Salciccia e Friarielle pizza.  About 5 minutes later our food was out.  Here is how it tasted.....................  Salciccia e Friarielle ($15.00)-  My mom really likes sausage on pizza.  There were a few pizza options that had sausage and this one sounded unique and delicious, so we tried it.  This pizza came with smoked mozzarella di Bufala, Schreiners (Local sausage place) sausage, rapini (kale...looked like broccoli rabe kind of) and olive oil.  I should have probably read the description better because I swear that this one came with red sauce.  Nope...it was a white pie (olive oil based sauce).  First bite in, I noticed a few different things.  1.  The smoked mozzarella di Bufala is incredibly smoky!  It had a super strong flavor profile which was just a tad overpowering.  It was good, but not pizza good...that cheese would be better with crackers or wine or something on its own..not melted on pizza.  2.  This pizza was really "wet".  When I removed my first slice, I noticed that the plate that it was on was real wet on the bottom.  The crust was more soggy than normal and it was hard to pick up, fold and eat.  Almost a knife and fork job.  The non soggy crust was fantastic though and the rapini put a unique spin on the pizza.  The Schreiners sausage was the best part of the thing.  They cubed up this sausage and it was spread out evenly.  It was delicious.  A plain margherita pizza with sausage as a topping may be the way to go if you are a sausage lover.  We ate the whole thing, it was pretty tasty and unique but I would never order it again. Not bad by any means, just different and every other pizza I have had from this pizza family has been way better.  Pizza Fritte (Calzone) ($10.00)-  Wow!  Just WOW!  You want to talk about massive!  This thing is the size of a football!  This calzone is unique in the fact that they fry this bitch instead of bake it.  I cut this thing open and saw the fantastic ingredients of mozzarella, ricotta, salami and tomatoes just begging to be shoved in my mouth.  It comes topped with basil strips and served with a side of marinara sauce.  I took a bite of the dough and was hooked.  Its like eating Indian fry bread in pizza dough form.  It was very unique and very tasty.  This thing was so big that I had to take half of it home.  Good morning breakfast!  Can't wait!  I will definitely get this thing again.  For sheer value ($10.00), its the best thing on the menu.    Service was great!   Our waitress was on top of things and checked in with us a few times during our meal.   4 stars for now because of a few things.  First, it's way far away from my house in Surprise.  Second, the Glendale one is closer, tastes better and has more of a "homey" feel to it.  If I am ever downtown though watching a Suns/Dbacks game and want some pizza, I will definitely head over here again.

So........me and my friends Kate and Louie were headed on down to the Cardinal game at Chase Field.  We decided to meet up for dinner beforehand.  We were originally going to go to a different pizza joint but it turns out they were closed on Mondays.  So were a bunch of other restaurants downtown...pretty much a food ghost town on Mondays.  Kate busted out her handy Yelp app and saw that Pizza People Pub was pretty close by plus they were open on Mondays.  I had personally never heard of the place, but I was in the mood for pizza to begin with, so Pizza People Pub sounded like a cool new spot to check out.  We headed on down that way.    It's right on Central near the Library and they have their own free parking lot...very cool.  We walked in and found the place to be very appealing.  It was hip but not "douchebag hipster".  More of a mellow vibe.  Not too many people were in the place and we were seated immediately.  About that.......the interior of the restaurant looks more like a smoking lounge than a restaurant.  They have these huge, high back, (p)leather chairs at the tables and some couches as well as high top tables with bar stool type chairs.  We were seated at a table right by the door with the high back chairs.  These chairs were so comfy and were hands down the best restaurant chairs I have ever sat in.  On to the food...........  This place is known for their pizzas and drinks.  Hence the name, Pizza People Pub.  Every day they have a "drink of the day" and it is only $4.00.  Kate and Louie partook in some of their beverages and they said that they were great!  The first time there, (yes...it was so good on Monday, we came back AGAIN on Wednesday) I went with a pizza called "The Hottie".  This was a pizza that came with green chiles, serrano chiles, jalapenos, mozzarella and sausage.  The second night there, I went with an order of Spud Fingers (oven roasted potatoes) and I went with a pizza that is currently not on their online menu.  I think the name of it was "The Manny".  This pizza had mozzarella, jalapeno cream cheese, onions, pepperoni, bacon, chili flakes and avocado.  Here is how they were............  The Hottie-  This was awesome!  They cut up fresh jalapenos and serranos and layer them  all over the pizza.  The pizza is topped with tons of green chile as well as crumbled sausage.  All of this is placed on top of a cornmeal dusted crust and then fired up in their oven.  It was damn tasty!  Spicy but not "burn your mouth" spicy.  The crust was very flavorful and held up well with all the toppings it had on it.  I would definitely get this again.   The Manny-  This pizza was fantastic except for one part of it.....the avocado.  They cut up pieces of avocado and put a slice on each piece (6 pieces total).  The problem with it was that the avocado was severely bruised and browned.  I'm not sure how they even brought that out and served it like that.  That was my only complaint with the whole dining experience.  I removed all the avocado and ate the rest of the pizza.  Good thing is, even without the avocado, this pizza was awesome!  It  had a ton of bacon on it, lots of chili flakes to give it a lot of heat, good pepperoni and even a few onions.  They kicker was the jalapeno cream cheese.  It was dolloped on sort of like ricotta.  It was creamy, spicy and added a nice flavor profile.  Minus the nasty ass avocado, this pizza was delicious!  Not as good as The Hottie, but still great flavors.  Spud Fingers-  They come 1lb to an order and they are served with their garlic/dill ranch sauce.  It was a thinner sauce but it went perfect with these potatoes.  It tasted great and was one of the better ranch type dressings I had ever had.  The potatoes had a little crunch on the outside and were soft on the inside.  They had sprinklings of parsley and salt on them and the flavor was great!  One order is big enough to share between a few people.  Kate and Louie ordered pizzas both nights and they liked what they got.  They also went with their Garlic Monkey Bread and their Piggies in Blankets.  I had a taste of each of those and they were great, too.  I am a pretty hard person to impress sometimes.  Pizza People Pub impressed me immediately!  Atmosphere is awesome, service was fantastic both nights, prices are reasonable and the food was great!  Another great pizza joint in Phoenix!  I will definitely be back!  Fantastic find by Kate!

I had been to a few other Oregano's before, and was always impressed.  The food is usually 4 star worthy, but the service itself has always been 5 stars.  I seriously cannot remember receiving such great service at a restaurant in a long time.  My wife, son, and buddy who was out here from Vegas, decided to come down to this location before we went to the Padre game.  We arrived at around 11:15 and were seated right away.  We placed our order for a large garden salad, an order of garlic bread, a small stuffed pizza with sausage and spinach and a small pepperoni pan pizza.  Here is how everything was............  Large Garden Salad-  Oregano's salads are massive!  They can feed a small army.  We each ate about 2 bowls full, and there were still leftovers.  Our waitress brought us our own individual dressings, too!  It was a pretty basic salad, but it gave us something to eat while waiting for the pizzas to cook (45 minutes or so).  The Italian dressing was very good!  Garlic Bread-  Solid!  About a 2 foot long loaf of garlic bread.  It had the perfect amount of butter/oil and garlic.  It tasted great!  I could have ate another loaf of it!  Everyone at the table thought it was great!  Stuffed Pizza-  I had only had Oregano's stuffed pizza once before, and it was fantastic!  My buddy is a huge sausage and spinach fan, so we went with those toppings.  Their stuffed pizza is a sight to see!  It's cut into 6 slices and each slice is about a pound.  Oregano's sausage is fantastic!  The spinach they use was pretty fresh, too.  It was a good combo of flavors.  We each ate 2 slices and were pretty much stuffed.  I took the other 2 slices home for leftovers.  Pan Pizza-  This was the first time I had experienced their pan pizza.  It was good, but not as good as their stuffed or thin crust Chicago style.  We got this one mostly for my wife, but it turns out she really didn't care for it.  She didn't like the sauce (Everyone that I have talked to that doesn't like Oregano's, doesn't like the sauce.)  I ate one slice and we took home about 4 slices.  Reheated the next day, it tasted fine.  I don't know if I would get the pan pizza again, but there was nothing wrong with it and it was pretty tasty.  On to why this place gets 5 stars.......THE SERVICE!  Our waitress was absolutely awesome!  She was very friendly, personable and happy.  She kept our drinks filled, plates cleared etc.  She even mentioned that we were the most easy going table she had all day and that she appreciated our laid back attitude.  Nice!  Every other employee I encountered was very welcoming, too.  That is 3 for 3 on different Oregano's, as far as receiving beyond excellent service.  That alone will keep me coming back!  Food is a solid 4, but the service always bumps it up to a 5 IMO.

I have hit the trifecta!  I am mega rich.....in pizza,  that is.  I woke up this morning and was in the mood for some pizza (as always!).  I decided to drive down and check out the Pomo in Scottsdale.  This was the third, and last Pomo I have been to.  I parked in the lot, walked inside and was seated at a table. I sat there for a good 5 minutes or so before anyone came over to greet me.  I thought things were going to be bad, but they improved greatly later on.  My server arrived and I got a glass of water as well as a "Peppino" Pizza.  Here is how it was..........  Peppino Pizza-  This pizza had spicy salame and ricotta cheese as the toppings (in addition to the tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella).  I took a bite and was instantly impressed.  Those ovens sure make magic happen.  The crust was nicely charred but not burnt, the mozzarella was creamy, and the salame was plentiful and provided a nice carnivorous flavor.  The only thing I did not really like was the ricotta.  Sure, it was there, but it didn't really add anything to the mix.  Overall, this pizza (minus the ricotta) was fantastic.  It was just as good as their other locations for the most part.  At the end of my meal, my server came over and asked if it was my first time here.  I told him yes, this specific location,  and that I had been to the Downtown and Glendale ones before.  He started asking me which one I preferred (Downtown location BTW...just something about it) and then started talking to me about the ovens etc.  Somehow, this conversation we had made it to the manager, Terry.  He came over and introduced himself and thanked me for coming in.  He also said they were opening one in Gilbert in the next few months (Eastsiders, rejoice!).  Service started out a little rocky, but at the end it was awesome!    Not sure if I'm coming back to this specific one any time soon (the other 2 are closer to my house), but if you are in the area, you probably can't find a better pizza!  This place is legit and one of the best pizzas in Phoenix!

My wife loves Jersey Mikes!  While she was pregnant, she couldn't eat any lunch meats (possibility of listeria).  Once she had our daughter, this was one of her first requests.  I hadn't had Jersey Mikes in awhile, so I was down, too!  We always get coupons in the mail so I decided to use one the other night.  You get 2 regular subs, 2 chips, and 2 drinks for $14.99.  Not bad!  I drove down and went inside.  I went with a #13, Italian sub and my wife went with a #8, the Club sub.  Went with some Ms Vickes salt and vinegar chips and a wild cherry Pepsi to drink.   Our sandwiches were good!  I like how they slice the meat when you order it, and when you get it topped "Mikes Way" it comes with oil and vinegar, lettuce, tomato and onion.  I added some of their hot pepper relish onto my sub, too.  It was a pretty solid sandwich!  We actually went here twice in 3 days!  Jersey Mikes sandwiches always get about a 3/3.5 star rating from me.  They are good, but they are never "great".  What WAS great though, was the customer service here.  There was a lady working (never got her name unfortunately) both Wednesday and Friday when I stopped in.  I had on my bracelet from the hospital and she asked me if I had a baby recently.  We started talking about kids and hospitals and all sorts of stuff. She was extremely friendly, personable and she also made a damn good sandwich!  When I came back in on Friday, she recognized me right away and asked how the baby was doing etc.  Great, great customer service!  Even though Jersey Mikes isn't my favorite, I would come back in just because of her.   As long as my wife loves and requests to eat at Jersey Mikes, I will continue to eat here.  With their coupons, prices aren't too bad, and I can think of much worse sandwiches you can get from other spots in town. Jersey Mikes is A-OK by me!

I have walked past this place probably a dozen or so times.  If I am down in this area, I am headed to Ingo's sister restaurant,  La Grande Orange,  for some pizza and baked goods.  I had always admired this beautiful, small, circular building, but I had never stopped in to try its food.  Recently, that changed!  I decided I would not cross the street to go to La Grande Orange, and instead, head here for a burger and some chips.  The pictures online and here on Yelp looked fantastic, and it was about damn time I tried everything out!    I drove down, parked in their overflow lot about a block down, and walked up to the joint.  A nice lady greeted me out on the patio and said that I could sit wherever I wanted.  I chose a nice little 2 top near a tree.  It was a beautiful 85 degree day out in Phoenix today, so I got some sunshine and shade all in one with the seat I chose.  I studied the menu for a bit and then placed my order.  I went with an order of Shattered Chips, a Paris Texas Burger (upgraded $1.00 to the grass fed beef) with no lettuce, and a glass of water to drink.  About 10 minutes later, my food was brought out to the table.  Here is how everything was............  Shattered Chips-  Um....FANTASTIC!  The word "fantastic" doesn't even really do them justice though. These "chips" are really thin sliced potatoes, deep fried to a golden brown, crunchy, yet still soft and chewy inside, piled high and then topped with some Lebni (pretty much a sour cream with a taste of lemon).  These chips also came with a little cup of green stuff that looked like salsa.  I took a bite of my first chip and was blown away at how great they were!  This was one of the best versions of ANY potato product I have ever had!  I dipped my chips in the Lebni and it was heavenly.  Next up, I dipped a chip in the green stuff.  WOW!   Taste explosion!  My waitress came around, and I asked what the green stuff was.  She told me that it was fermented/pickled jalapenos!  This stuff was awesome!  Tasted great, and packed just enough heat.  She told me that they were eventually going to bottle and sell that stuff.  I would buy it in a heartbeat!  It was a great compliment to the cold, smooth Lebni dip and the perfectly fried chips!  I would come back here again just for these chips...maybe order a take out container full of them.  They were flat out awesome! 5+ Stars!   Paris Texas Burger-  This burger came with a grass fed patty cooked perfectly medium, some cheddar cheese, some Nueskes bacon, pickles and some apple bbq sauce.  It usually comes with lettuce, but I left that off of there.  The only place lettuce belongs, is in a salad ;-).  This burger was presented very nice.  It was cut in half and held together by long toothpicks.  I took a bite and was pretty impressed.  The bbq sauce kind of overpowered everything, but it was still delicious and you could tell it was a high quality burger. The Nueskes bacon is awesome btw!  The grass fed beef itself was very tasty!   Maybe not the best burger I have ever had, but still a solid 4 star burger on its own.  I finished my meal, paid my check (just under $15.00)  and then walked inside.  Sitting there on the counter is a huge glass container full of mini sea salt chocolate chip cookies!  Yes, the same ones that they make and sell at La Grande Orange, only about 1/10th the size.  These cookies are like crack...I always have to get one whenever I go to La Grande Orange.  Perfectly crunchy, moist, gooey, salty and flat out delicious.  I grabbed about 5 of them, put them on a napkin and was on my way back to my car.  What a nice touch to end your meal!  Service was excellent!  All 3 of the ladies I interacted with were super friendly and helpful!  I will definitely be heading back here sooner than later.  Maybe a pizza from La Grande Orange across the street and an order of chips from here might hit the food jackpot, eh?  Wash it down with some mini sea salt cookies?  That, my friends, might be a perfect meal!  I will definitely be trying that combo out in the next month or so.  Can't wait!

I had been wanting to come here for a long, long time! My friend Cynthia went here a few months ago, and told me it was legit! (I trust her opinion...she was born/raised in San Diego, and she knows what's up when it comes to Mexican food!)  We finally made it down here the other day for dinner.  We parked in the back lot, and walked inside.  We were greeted immediately and shown to a table.  We were served a basket of chips, browsed the menu for a bit and then placed our order.  I went with a plethora of tacos which included a fish taco, a mole taco, a cochinita pibil taco, an al pastor taco and a carne asada taco.  Here is how they were.............  Fish Taco-  They make these with dogfish.  It was a hefty sized taco and it was mighty delicious.  It had 2 pieces of perfectly fried fish inside.  I had never had dogfish until today.  It was a very meaty and chewy fish.  Most fish tacos are white fish that break apart easily.  This fish was almost like a steak!  I would definitely get this one again.  Mole Taco-  Shredded chicken with a rich mole sauce service on top of a double corn tortilla.  It was good, but not my favorite of my selections.  Not sure if I would get this one again.  A tad messy, too.  Cochinita Pibil Taco-  This was roasted pork shoulder topped with pickled red onions.  The pork was nice and moist, and the onions gave it a nice bite.  I would get it again.  Al Pastor Taco-  This taco came topped with a a decent amount of pork, some hot red sauce, some cool avocado sauce and also some pineapple.  It was definitely tasty.  Maybe not on par with my Tacos El Gordo in SD, but still a good al pastor taco.  I would get this one again.  Carne Asada Taco-  This was my favorite of the day!  This taco came prepared simple with just steak and some cabbage (It's an AZ thing..the cabbage).  This steak was so well marinated, and so tender, it was a pleasure to eat.  I wish I would have ordered maybe 3 or 4 of these things.  It was by far the best carne asada I have had in AZ, and could hold its own vs any asada back in SD.  It was incredibly legit!  I may come back and get this in a burrito from here.  Winner, winner, carne asada dinner!   Besides the great tacos, this place has a super awesome salsa bar!  They had at least 10 different, home made salsas on display.  I tried about 5 of them and each one was unique and tasty.  They have great chips, too!  Thin and crispy!  They went well with all the great salsas.  We got 2 baskets full.  Service was on point and all the young ladies working in the place were on top of everything!  I'm glad I went here and will definitely be coming back...soon!  Best Mexican food I have had in AZ so far!

For whatever reason, last night, I had a HUGE craving for some Cafe Rio Barbacoa Nachos.  I have only had them twice before so I don't know why/how this strong craving came about.  Granted, the nachos are freaking delicious and are definitely some of the best nachos I have ever had.  Still, it's a random craving to have out of nowhere.   I Yelped Cafe Rio and found out that there was one semi close to my house.  Guess where I went to lunch today?  Yup........nacho, nacho man......I want to be, a nacho man!  Rolled down here and got in line and placed my order for my pork barbacoa nachos.  Whenever you order nachos, the staff sings the nacho man song.  Its pretty funny yet a bit uncomfortable to hear all of them bust out a tune while making your food.  Anyways.......I got mine topped with  all the usual stuff (pico, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, black beans,  Dr. Pepper soaked pork barbocoa).   Total for nachos and a drink was a little over $11.50.  Here is how they were.................  Pork Barbacoa Nachos-  These things are possibly the best order of nachos out there.  They pile a grip of tortilla chips into a little tin foil container.  They then top your chips with a grip of cheese and meat of your choice.  They send it through a little conveyor belt to melt the cheese and then load it up with the other toppings mentioned in my previous paragraph ;-).  Everything works well.  The sweetness of the pork barbacoa, the crispy chips, the stringy cheese and the heartiness of the black beans all blend together perfectly.  They are a bit skimp on the guacamole and sour cream but they still give you enough to mix it around a bit.  Overall, they are just excellent nachos...some of the best nachos I have ever had.  Oh yeah, they serve Coke products which is sweet!    Once again, I was very impressed.  I have not had anything else from here, and doubt I will ever get anything else from here besides the nachos.  Stick with a winner, right?  These nachos are fantastic and are a must order every single time!  Trust me ;-)

This place is awesome!  I was enjoying some Teds Hot Dogs (3 times in the last 5 days......that's another story in itself..but anyways....) and looked across the street and noticed a Joe's Italian Ice.  I hit up my phone to see if this was THE Joe's of Anaheim fame.  Yep..sure was!  They have 2 in OC and this one here in the desert.  Teds and Joes back to back?  Yes..yes indeed.  After my dogs, I came over here to get some dessert.  I walked inside and placed my order for a large Joe Latti ( Vanilla custard on the bottom, Italian Ice in between and then more custard on top) with 2 flavors.  I chose Bada Bing Cherry and Red Raspberry.  Paid the lady my money and took a seat.  This place is COOL!  They have a bunch of retro stuff all around and even candy machines for a nickel etc.  She whipped up my concoction and I dug in.  This thing was awesome!  The Bada Bing Cherry is FULL of huge pieces of cherries.  The red raspberry was good but not as flavorful as the dark deep red of the cherry.  I would probably get all Bada Bing Cherry next time.The custard is nice and creamy and doesn't taste like whipped cream (Ritas...I'm looking at your nasty ass custard!)  The combo of ice and custard blend together very well.  The large one is gigantic too.  Its probably too much frozen dessert for one man to eat but I plowed through it and it was delicious.   I am super stoked they have one of these here.  Teds and Joes is a perfect one two punch.  I will be back in due time.  This ice is so good, its totally worth driving out here from anywhere in the valley.

I'm not the hugest fan of Jersey Mikes (My wife is though!), but whenever I eat one, it is never bad, and actually tastes pretty good for a chain type sub shop.  I was undecided on what to get for lunch today, but then I checked my Facebook page, and saw that today, March 30th, Jersey Mikes was donating all their proceeds to local charities (Phoenix Childrens Hospital)!  We had/have so much love for Children's Hospitals (Radys in San Diego, mostly!), I knew that I would have to come down and get lunch.  I went with a regular #13 (Italian Sub), chips (Doritos) and a drink (Wild Cherry Pepsi).  My total was just over $11.00.  The sandwich was tasty!  I had them hook it up with extra oil and vinegar.  The bread was soft, the meats were plentiful, and I loved the extra oil and vinegar.  It made the bread really soft and provided great flavor!  It definitely hit the spot!  Doritos are always good, and the drink was alright (Coke fan, here).    Service was friendly and I enjoyed my lunch.  Super awesome that all of todays proceeds are going to a great cause, too!  I hope they do this every year!  As long as they do, I will definitely be back!

The best BBQ out West?  Yes...yes indeed.  Head and shoulders above anything else!   After a semi disappointing BBQ meal on Thursday night, I needed some redemption.  I decided to drive down here on Friday morning.  I arrived at around 10:40 and there was already a line of about 15 people deep.  I grabbed a seat on the bench in the shade and waited patiently until they opened.  During this time, one of the owners/employees was showing the smoker to some folks and handing out bottled water and directing traffic all at the same time.  Good man!  They opened the doors right at 11 and everyone got excited!  Right around 11:30, I was in the door and ready to order.  I got up to the counter and was handed some fatty brisket chunks (burnt ends). Melt in your mouth tender!  It was a great sample!  I then placed my order.  I ordered one beef rib, 2 pork ribs, 1/4lb of fatty brisket and a sausage.  The guy busts out this rack of 3 beef ribs.  He asks me which one I want and I tell him to pick.  He cuts me the center rib!  He then slices up my brisket, ribs and sausage.  They weigh everything out, put it on butcher paper on a tray, you pay and then go eat. My total was $37.00.  A tad steep for one person for one meal but it was totally worth it.  Next time I would order things different, but this time I had no regrets.   Here are how the meats stacked up.....................................  Fatty Brisket-($18.00 lb)  Whenever I eat brisket, I am never too impressed.  It always tastes like pot roast and is just ok.  You know why that is?  Because I have continually tried shitty brisket.  This brisket here at Little Miss BBQ is PROPER brisket and is exactly how brisket SHOULD taste!  I loved it!  You could see the smoke ring, the honeycomb pattern, the nice thick bark etc.  These slices of brisket were beautiful to look at and a pleasure to eat.  I wish I had ordered more of it.  It was melt in your mouth tender.  It was SO DAMN GOOD!  Beef Rib- ($18.95 lb)  This thing was a beast!  He cut me off the center rib and it weighed something like 1.3lbs!  That is why my meal was so expensive.  This rib alone was probably close to $25.00.  This thing was so huge, it was scary.  This rib was fatty, rich and decadent.  I just kept pulling it apart with my fingers and digging in.  They are only available on Friday and Saturdays.  I probably would not get one again though just because of the cost factor.  I would rather have a pound and and a half of brisket rather that one beef rib.  Don't get me wrong, the thing was amazing, but for $20-25, I would rather get some of their other delicious meats.  Pork Ribs- ($16.00 lb..I think?)  I got 2 of these.  They are St. Louis style ribs.  Smoked perfect, seasoned well.  I have had better pork ribs, but these were still killer and I would definitely get them again.  The meat came off with a little tug and it was chewy yet tender at the same time.    Sausage- ($3.75 a link)  The sausage was fantastic!  It was a coarser grind than most sausages I am used to but it worked.  It had a little spice to it and a lot of garlic/onion taste.  The texture in your mouth was fantastic and I loved every bite of it.  I would definitely get it again!  This BBQ was so damned good!  By far the best brisket I have ever had, the beef rib was awesome, the pork ribs were delicious and the sausage was great too!  No complaints at all!  The only thing that will keep me away are the lines.  Get there early, or be prepared to wait for a long long time!  Even if you have to wait, it is still totally worth it.  You can't get much better BBQ than this!

Came back today and ordered a few things.  I got here at 10:30 and was still about 15th in line.  I got my food and was eating by 11:20 though.  I ordered a 1/2lb of fatty brisket, a 1/4 lb of turkey and a sausage link.  All of this came out to a little over $20.00.  The sausage was the best part of the meal today.  I will always get a link whenever I come here.  The brisket today was just a tad off. It had a little weird aftertaste to it that I did not encounter last time.   Still very good and better than anywhere else around, but it wasn't as good/tasty as the first time I came here.  I think it could have been cooked/smoked just a little longer.  The bark was not as prevalent  and the fat in the brisket did not render down completely.  I had more than a few bites of gelatinous fat where as the last time I came here, it was PERFECT!  Hopefully it was just a one off.  I will try, try try again lol.   I also ordered and tried out their turkey for the first time.  It was great!  It was moist, smoked properly and sliced perfectly.  I would definitely get it again.  The only thing I haven't tried out is the pulled pork.  I will try that out next time I come.   Service was friendly as always.  No complaints there.  I just hope the fatty brisket comes out a smidge better next time.

My wife always takes my son here.  This morning, I went with them.  The place is pretty cool.  It has a bunch of toys for the kids to play with as well as a bouncy house, tons of slides and a couple of Thomas the Tank trains they can ride on.  Cost is a bit steep if you pay regular price ($9.00 or something), but they have Groupons for about $4.00 per visit when you buy a card with 10 visits on it.  Make sure you bring socks...cant wear flip flops inside the play area.  The temperature inside the place was running a little bit warm and had a semi musty smell to it.  Nothing horrid though and all the toys seemed to be in excellent shape.  We will definitely be back.

I had been to the one in Scottsdale a few years back and remember not liking it as much as I should have.  I saw that this place was close to where I ate lunch at so I decided to stop in.  I ordered the Campfire S'Mores Sundae which was 2 scoops of Belgian Chocolate ice cream, a roasted marshmallow, whipped cream & hot fudge in waffle bowl.  It was pretty solid.  A little steep in price ($8.00) but it was good.  The ice cream is made in small batches and you can tell.  The toasted marshmallow was great.  It was a good sundae.  I love ice cream and Sweet Republic makes some good stuff.  Ill check out some of their other items at a later date.

Been about a year and a half since my last review here.  Figured it would be time for an update!   Good thing is, not much has changed, and I appreciate their ice cream even more, now!   Today was a great day!  I got to meet my Yelp buddy, Dave G., broke bread at a couple of places, (Pane Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco) then decided to come here for some dessert to cap off our fantastic bromantic lunch date.    I saw a flavor that I hadn't seen there before called Bananas Foster.  I asked for a sample and it tasted EXACTLY like my moms banana bread.  I knew I had to throw a scoop of that in to the mix somewhere.  I decided to go with a 3 scoop waffle cone and chose the bananas foster, dutch chocolate and fleur de sel caramel.  It was pretty much a perfect combo of flavors.  I had the caramel first and it was rich and sweet.  Below that was my chocolate scoop which was dark and delicious.  My final scoop was the bananas foster.  I was super impressed with that flavor!  I probably could have had 2-3 scoops of just that!  Like I said before, it tasted just like my moms banana bread.  It was awesome!   To top everything off, I got down to my last few bites of my waffle cone, and there was a little chocolate surprise waiting for me at the bottom (a la Drumsticks...little chocolate piece in the tip of the cone).  I use to think that this place was just a tad too expensive for what you get.  If you come everyday and eat ice cream, sure, it can get pricey.  But for an every once in awhile visit, it is well worth the drive out here and the above average cost.  This ice cream is home made, very rich and creamy, and flat out delicious!  It would be hard to argue that there is better ice cream anywhere in the Phoenix area.  I'll definitely be back sooner than later!

I just moved to Surprise and I needed a 90,000 mile service done.  I tried to call one place that "specializes in Toyotas"  in Phoenix that had some good reviews and I even emailed them,  but they never replied back.  I decided to check out somewhere closer to my house and Maxs came up.   I called them up and they had an appointment available when I needed one.  I took my car in and left it there because I had to run some errands with a Uhaul.  Anyways.............  I had a great experience!  Terry was awesome and got my car taken care of.  He even explained what was done, how he did it, what was recommended for down the road etc.  Most places will either try to gouge new customers, or fix it and get you on your way like you are just a number and not really care.  This place was different.  They were very personable and extremely nice and friendly.  I found my "car guy" and will take my car to them for as long as I am in Arizona.  Very reasonably priced for what they did, too.  I miss my buddy Scott from Toyota in Santee, but I feel good knowing that Terry and the Max Auto crew is nearby me now!

Eh....not too impressed.  We needed somewhere to go after the Padre game, so we looked up breweries/brew pubs on Yelp, and this place popped up.  It was pretty close to the Peoria stadium, so we headed on over.  We walked in, grabbed a table, and placed our order.  Me and my buddy went with a small garlic fries, and he ordered a flight of beers.  Here is how they were.........  Garlic Fries-  Meh.  The fries themselves were good, but then the garlic they use was bad.  It was cold, and tasted very "wet" and "vinegary".  It just wasn't good at all.  We had to pick around all the garlic to enjoy the fries.  Beer Flight-  My buddy ordered 5 beers.  He only liked one of them.  He flat out couldn't drink one of them, and had to choke down 3 of the other 4.  They had a "smokey" type beer that was absolutely horrid.  I took a swig and almost instantly spit it up. It tasted like drinking a beer with a cigar ash in it.  It was disgusting! I don't know how they could serve that and who in their right mind would enjoy that.  They also had a maple type beer.  Tasted like maple syrup which was very weird.  My buddy said it wasn't the worst brewery he has been to, but it was up there.   Service was friendly, and the owner came around and introduced herself and welcomed us etc.  That was a nice touch.  Sadly though, the fries and beer were sub par so I would probably never come back.  I do hope they succeed though...its family run and owned and the place was pretty full while we were there.  Someone must like it, right?  Sadly, it just wasn't us :-(

This place is about 5 minutes or so from our house.  I always forget that it is here, and that might be a good thing!  Ice cream is my favorite food, and if I always remembered it was here, I would be even larger than I already am!    My wife and sons birthdays are both in January, so Baskin Robbins sent them a free scoop of ice cream coupon for their birthday.  We got a scoop of chocolate for my son, some gold medal ribbon for my wife and I went with a scoop of chocolate almond and a scoop of cookie dough.  With the coupons, my total was only like $2.40 (I think it should have been like $4.40 because of my 2 scoops, but whatever..I'm not complaining lol).  Baskin Robbins chocolate ice creams are really, really good!   We all thoroughly enjoyed our ice cream.  We will definitely be back!   Tip- Sign up for their birthday club!  Free ice cream!

I hate to kill all the 5 star reviews, but I have to!  This place was meh and I will tell you why............  Came here a few weeks back because I was craving some carne asada.  According to these Yelp reviews, this asada was legit.  I drove on down because I had to find out.  I walked inside and the place was empty.  A dude was sitting behind the register and I saw a ladies head in the back kitchen area.  I scoped out the menu for a bit and decided to go with a Fuego Taco and a Carne Asada burrito with no beans.  My total was right around $10.00.  I paid the man my money and then I took a seat.  Here is where it kind of went South...........  I was sitting there waiting for my food and I saw the lady cook in the back straight up wipe her nose with her forearm.  I probably should have bounced right then and there and gotten my money back and gone somewhere else.  I decided that it wasn't a total deal breaker (I've been to taco carts all over the place where sanitary conditions are questionable.  I have never gotten sick before and my stomach is pretty solid.) and decided to eat what I had ordered.  I stocked up on some salsas and took my food to go.  I drove back to work and dug in.  Here is how everything was...................  Fuego Taco-  This thing looked solid.  It was a small open faced taco with carne asada, green chilis, and melted mozzarella cheese (interesting choice of cheese).  I folded it up and took a bite.  I was pretty impressed.  The carne asada had a great smoky flavor and the chilis added some bite.  The cheese was melted nicely and the tortilla was nice and soft.  The main component in this was that the carne asada had no gristle in it.  I wish I could say the same about my next item..............  Carne Asada Burrito-  I got this burrito without the beans that usually come with it.  This thing had carne asada and cheese and that's it.  The size of the thing was decent but right when I bit in, I knew it wasn't going to be good.  First bite in, I got an unchewable piece of gristle.  Nasty!  I also noticed that the cheese they use is mozzarella.  If it was melted it would have been decent.  This was straight up cold shredded mozzarella.  The layering of the burrito was all wrong too.  All the meat was on one side, the cheese on the other.  I took a few more bites and got more gristle.  Not sure how you can have a very good taco, but a horrible burrito all from the same place.  After awhile, I was picking through the burrito to find "good" pieces of meat.  I picked out all the cheese and tried to make the best of it.  I wound up wasting about 2/3rds of the burrito.  Super bummer.  Way too much gristle in this burrito and even the "good bites" weren't that great.  Sadly, I will never come back.  It had potential and the taco was actually really good.  The burrito was horrible though and the wipe of the nose pretty much made me not want to come back anytime soon.  My quest for good carne asada in Phoenix continues.......

I had a buddy from out of town staying with me this weekend, and he enjoys his beers.  We had lunch at Pizzeria Bianco down the street, and then decided to stop here on the way back.  I was driving, so I ordered a Coke.  My buddy got a flight of beers.  The setup of the place is pretty cool.  The bar is huge!  Bartender James was super chill and very friendly.  My buddy thought the beers were just ok but really liked the atmosphere.  James hooked me up with my Coke for free.  Cool spot and I would definitely bring people back.

I was trying to find another coffee joint but I stumbled upon this one.  I pulled up and some young "bro" greeted me in the drive through and asked me what I wanted.  I told him,  a large coffee with extra cream and 3 Splendas.  He texted my order in to the people inside the shop.  I drove up to the window and was greeted by a friendly young person (Identities will not be exposed ;-) lol).  This person was super chipper.  Let me put it this way....... my brother lives up in Humboldt.  He likes to "garden" and grow different kind of "plants".   This person and my brother would be best friends.  If you have no idea what I am referring to, move along....move along.   Anyways............ I got to the window and assumed that they would have my order ready since the "bro" texted it to them.  I was greeted with, "What are you having today?"  Um...you should know this, lol.  Anyways, I repeated my order and we started getting to talking.  This person was super duper "friendly" and we shot the shit for a minute about our morning.  It came up that it was my first time here.  This person was super excited to hear that and they hooked me up with a punch card and stamped the living shit out of it!  I will get a free coffee soon!  Score!  As far as the coffee, I loved 2 things about it.  1.)  It was a perfect temperature to drink.  It was hot but not mouth scorching.  2.)  I like their cups/lids.  They have lids with like a little nipple on them which makes it super easy to drink while you are driving. The coffee itself was ok.  I prefer DD over this but I prefer this over Starbucks.  $3.00 for a large coffee isn't cheap, but for the excellent "happy" service, cool vibe of the place, and convenience factor, I am a fan.  Don't know how frequent I will be back, but it hit the spot this morning and the customer service was wonderful!

This was yay close to getting a 1!  It was pretty damn bad.  Totally disappointed and I will never come back to this one.  The one in Chandler was good when we went but this one in Goodyear SUCKED!  I walked in and placed my order for 3 pork ribs, 3 baby back ribs, 1/4lb of fatty brisket and a half of a jalapeno sausage.  That and a small drink came out to $28.00!  Jesus Christ, right?  I don't mind paying top dollar for food.  Price doesn't phase me.  When it's for slop though, it does.  This was some slop for the most part.  Paid the lady my money, got my drink and took a seat.  Here is how everything was......................  Baby Back Ribs-  Horrible.  Absolutely horrible!  I probably should have taken them back and gotten my money refunded.  They were tough as nails.  Baby backs usually are the most tender ribs and they should fall off the bone rather easily.  Not these things.  I had to use my hyena jaws to try and get the meat off these things.  The membrane was tough, the meat didn't even taste good, they were curled up for some weird reason, and they seemed like they were baked instead of smoked/bbqd.  They were the worst ribs I have ever had in my 36 years on Earth.  Boiled ribs from the cafeteria in grade school were eons better than these things.  You couldn't pay me to try these again!  Fatty Brisket-  Another disappointment.  Instead of slicing the brisket, they serve it all hacked up in chunks.  That in itself can be ok.  The fact that 1/2 of my 1/4lb was congealed fat globs is not ok.  I understand "fatty" and am down with some fat and it does make things delicious. I am not down with a whole pile of grease and chunks upon chunks of fat though.  I picked around it and ate most of it, but once again I was disappointed.  I would not get it again.  After having proper brisket 2 weeks ago, this stuff is just dog food compared to what brisket is supposed to be like.  I would never get brisket here again.  1/2 Jalapeno Sausage-  Strike 3!  This sausage was presented nicely, split down the middle and you could see the chunks of jalapenos in it.  The taste of it was not good though.  It was lukewarm and kind of dry.  The casing was a bit too thick and chewy and the taste was just meh.  I wouldn't get one again.  Pork Ribs-  The ONLY redeeming thing about this meal and the ONLY thing saving it from a 1 star review.  These pork ribs were actually fantastic!  They were smoked nice, meaty, tender and delicious.  I should have just ordered a pound of these things and it would have been a good meal.  I don't get how these things can be so great yet the other 3 meats I tried were absolutely horrible!  If I come back (99% sure I wont), I will only order the pork ribs.  Service was fine.  The cashier was nice and friendly.  The food blew though AND it was expensive.  That is a deadly combo right there and a waste of almost $30 bucks.  I will go back to the Chandler one sometime in the future to see if they are still good.  If they are lacking too, Rudys is out of my rotation.  Much better BBQ out there in Phoenix.

I was at work last week and wanted a sandwich, but didn't want to go to the usual chain type places.  I did a quick search on Yelp and this placed popped up.  I recognized the address due to it being near/next to Chino Bandido, but never knew this place was here.  Turns out that it just opened recently.  I got in my car, drove down, parked outside and walked in.  I was greeted right away and shown a menu of their sandwiches.  I decided to go with their version of a Cuban sandwich.  Their version of their Cuban is a little different than most.  Their version is described as, dijon crusted pork tenderloin, spanish chorizo, Swiss cheese, Sammiches own zesty bread and butter pickles, and German mustard loaded on our signature baguette.  I got the combo meal which included fries and drink.  Total was right around $11.00.  Here is how it was...........  Cuban Sandwich-  This thing was fantastic!  One of the best sandwiches I have had in Phoenix!  The pork tenderloin was sliced nice and thick, the spanish chorizo was thinly sliced into cirlces, the Swiss cheese was nice and melty, the bread was hot, toasty, crispy yet chewy inside.  The pickles were awesome, and the German grain mustard really tied everything together.  This sandwich was fantastic!  The fries that came with it were very tasty too.  They are a crinkle cut fry and they were fried up and salted perfectly.  A great meal.  While I was waiting for my sandwich, and during my lunch, the owner Jacob started up some friendly conversation.  I was wearing my St. Louis Cardinals hat and we started talking about baseball (he is a Yankees fan) and other things.  Really personable dude!  During our conversation, I started asking about the menu and other sandwiches and inquired if he ever had a meatball sandwich on the menu.  He told me that on Fridays, he did.  I told him I would see him on Friday to try it out.  Here is how that one was............  Meatball Sandwich (The Knuckle)-  This sandwich comes with toasty bread, sliced pepperoni layered on the bread, and then meatballs cradled inside the pepperoni, topped with cheese and then served with a side of marinara to put on yourself!  This sandwich was tasty as well!  The meatballs had a great texture and I liked the addition of pepperoni to the sandwich.  The cheese could have been broiled/melted just a little bit more, but the sandwich overall was very good.  Once again, the fries were great!  The best part of this was that it's his Friday Special.  Sandwich, fries and the drink are only $7.50!  Can't beat that deal!  During my meal, I chatted it up with Jacob and Mariah (hostess/cashier) for awhile longer and he told me about some menu additions he is thinking about doing etc.  Good times!  If you are looking for a local, friendly shop that serves great sandwiches, head on down here!  Prices are great, hospitality is awesome, and the sandwiches are unique and different compared to most other sandwich shops.  I will definitely be back to try out their other sandwiches and to shoot the shit with Jacob. I'm still thinking about that Cuban!  Might have to come back next week and get another.  It was fantastic!

Never heard of this place until I moved to Phoenix.  I was curious about it, and finally decided that today was the day I would try them out.  I placed my order online and then drove down the 17 to Peoria to pick up my stuff.  The whole process went pretty smooth.  They didn't have my order ready right at 2:15, but they threw it together pretty quick once I arrived for pickup.  I ordered a "Big" Italian, a Chocolate Brownie Cookie and a "Dream Bar".  Total for everything was just over $10.00 with tax.  Here is how everything was..........  Italian-  Whenever I go to a new sandwich shop, I usually will order their version of an Italian hoagie.  If a place can make a good one of those, I will be back to try out their other stuff.  Potbelly's version of the Italian was good for the most part.  It comes with Capicaola, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Salami and Provolone.  I got mine topped with lettuce, tomato, onions and oil/vinegar.  The loaf of bread they throw it on is very good.  Its toasted all the way around (inside and outside) and provides a nice texture.  The heating of the meats allows for the flavors to shine through.  About the meats....A little bit skimpish!  It probably only had one slice of each meat on the sandwich.  I would advise ordering "double meat" if you get one of their sandwiches.  I also noticed that the produce started to warm a bit too much after my short car ride.  It would probably taste better there in the store.  Still, it was a solid sandwich and better than a lot of chain type shops.  3.5 stars.  The sandwich was only like $6.49, so even though it was a bit skimp on the meats, the value to goodness ratio was definitely there.  Chocolate Brownie Cookie-  Delicious!  It was in round cookie form, but tasted like a warm, gooey brownie.  The cookie kind of fell apart in my hands, but it was damn delicious!  It had a little crisp around the edges, then super soft, and even a bit warm in the middle.  I would get this again.  Dream Bar-  This is similar to a magic cookie square my mom used to make.  Its basically a chocolate chip cookie base, topped with caramel, cut into bar form.  It was mighty fine!  Soft and smooth and you could tell that A LOT of butter went into these.  I have a super sweet tooth and this was right up my alley.  Definite repeat purchase.  Overall, I was pretty happy with my meal.  Order double meat, and eat it there, and you will have a great experience.  Service was friendly enough, and the price was excellent for a good, filling lunch.  I will be back to try out their other sandwiches.

I have been to other places like this, but I hadn't tried out MOD, yet.  I have been down this way a few times to get frozen yogurt at Menchies, and MOD has always peaked my interest.  My buddy in Orange County has also mentioned this spot to me a few times.  I figured that it was time to check it out!  I walked in and was asked if I had been there before.  I replied with, "No." and was given a quick rundown.  Pretty much the same as the other "create your own pizza places".  They had a mini, a regular and a double size. They have preset pizza combinations, or you could make your own.   I went with the regular size with red sauce, cheese, pepperoni, meatballs, onions, roasted garlic cloves and regular minced garlic.  My main objective was to keep vampires away and to have some super kicking breath for my coworkers when I returned from lunch.  Mission successful! ;-)  My pizza and a fountain drink came out to just over $10.00.  Not bad!  Here is how everything was..............  My Pizza Creation-  If your pizza doesn't taste good, that's on you!  You picked out the toppings!  My pizza looked delicious once it came out of the oven.  The bottom had a nice char and the crust of the pizza was delicious.  My combo of pepperoni, meatball, onion and 2 kinds of garlic was fantastic.  The roasted garlic was soft and sweet, the regular garlic was pungent and delicious!  They use a crumbled type meatball here and they tasted great.  The onions were of the sliced red variety.  Plenty of pepperoni, too! The cheese was good but would have been better if it were a fresh mozzarella.  It was a bit soft and probably could have been cooked an extra 30 seconds to brown up the cheese.   The only other beef I had with this pizza was that the dough was a bit "sticky".  When I bit into my pizza, a few times, the dough sort of separated.  It was like the toppings were floating on top of the crust instead of being baked/sealed in with the crust.  Nothing major, just something I noticed.    Drink-  They have fresh brewed lemonade!  2 kinds, too.  Regular and marionberry!  Crushed ice, and a cold refreshing lemonade hit the spot!   They were both good, but the regular one was a tad better.    Overall, I was happy with my meal.  Service was good, pizza was good, price was very fair and it's not too far from work.  It's not as good as Fired Pie IMO, but its still a mighty fine, quick lunch for around $10.00.  I'm sure I will be back sooner than later.

Me and my buddies decided to come down here tonight to watch Nick DiPaolo.  He is my favorite comedian out there right now (has been for awhile now), and just so happened to be performing here for a few nights.  We got tickets to the 7:30 show on Friday March 27th.  We headed on down, parked across the street (free) and walked on over.   We got there pretty early, so we were seated right up front next to the stage. The seating here is a few rows of long tables.  Seats were right next to each other but I never felt like I couldn't move or stretch out my legs etc.  Some other clubs I have been to, you are packed in so tight, you can't even sit and enjoy yourself.  Not here...the club was pretty spacious.  It also helped that the place was only about 1/3 full for this early show.    Once we got settled, we ordered some food and drinks and were ready to get the night started!   My buddy and I split an appetizer platter which came with some type of South West egg rolls, taquitos, 4 chicken wings, some bacon wrapped meat item and tons of fries.  It was like $20.00.  It was plenty big and we didn't finish all the fries.  My brother in law got a BBQ chicken flatbread pizza type thing and his buddy ordered a salad.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the food.  Maybe not the best food ever, but still pretty good. I had a Coke to drink and the other guys ordered some beer and Captain and Cokes.  Drinks were a bit steep, ($2.50 for a Coke...no refills, and around $15.00 for a double Captain and Coke) but considering you are in a comedy club, they weren't that outrageous I guess.  Our server was incredibly friendly, on top of everything and provided great service throughout the night.  My brother in laws buddy picked up the tab which was awesome!  Before the comedians came on, they had a magician walking through the crowd showing different tables some tricks.  He pulled off 3 magic tricks for us at our table and they were very impressive.  I have no idea how the hell he did them and he was like a foot in front of me and I was watching him pretty well.  He was awesome!  It was a great start to the night!  This is probably the only beef I had with this club........ Before the comics started, they show a little video of some comedy clips from movies, and a little Arizona themed video.  It was pretty cool but the speakers they have during this portion were way way way way too loud.  I don't know if it was because we were up front and right under them or what?  Whatever the case, my ears started ringing and it was super annoying.  Please turn down the volume on those videos.  There is absolutely no need for it to be that loud.  Thank you ;-).  The comics were amazing. The host comic had some decent jokes.  The first comic, Charlie Speez, had some funny ass jokes too.  He did one about a "subscription to Source magazine" which might have been the joke of the night.  He was legit!   And then of course, the reason we were there..........Nick DiPaolo!  I have waited probably 15 years to see this guy live, and tonight was the night.  If you have never listened to him before, please go do so immediately.  By far, the best stand up show I have ever seen!  He did at least an hour and it was non stop laughs.  He is the best there is!  The best part of the night was after the show.  He was hanging out, and we got to meet him and get a picture with him.  It meant a lot and I told him why.  Yesterday, March 27th was the anniversary of the day my dad passed away.  I had some rough times the few years after it happened.  Nick's CDs were one of the things that got me through that time.  If I was ever sad and needed a laugh, I would throw on "Born This Way" or "Road Rage" and it would make me forget about being sad, and let me laugh for a bit and cheer me up.  I told him this little story and it seemed like he was truly humbled by it.  Shook his hand and we were on our way.  Couldn't have asked for a better night!

I was driving down Bell Road, and saw a sign on the side of the road that said, "Thrifty Ice Cream".  Instantly, I had flashbacks to Rite Aid and Sav On Drugstores from my days growing up in Los Angeles!  I knew at some point, I would have to investigate this and grab some of this ice cream for a couple of reasons.  A.  Thrifty Ice Cream!  When the heck do you ever see Thrifty Ice Cream anymore?  Um...probably never!  It's like the UFO of the ice cream brands.  You know it exists, but you only hear about it or see it once in a blue moon.  B.  Chocolate Malted Crunch!  End of story...shit is bomb!  Anyways..........  Me and my son had to run some errands today, so we decided to stop.  Walked in the place, browsed the selection and placed our order.  I got a scoop of chocolate malted crunch and a scoop of cookies and cream.  I got a scoop of plain chocolate for my son.  Prices were very reasonable.  One scoop $1.70, two scoops $2.70, three scoops $3.70.  Total was just under $5.00.  We got our ice cream, grabbed a seat at one of the half dozen tables inside, and dug in.  The ice cream was just as good as I had remembered!  Just a little bit icy in parts, but it didn't detract from the overall goodness.  They even use the same shaped scoopers from way back in the day.  The scoops had that signature "square, yet still round" type shape that is extremely unique.  Good stuff!  The dude working in the shop was very friendly.  I'm sure I will have a chocolate malted crunch craving sooner than later, so we will definitely be back!

4 stars for now but definitely a 5 star possibility!  This place is right near where I work.  I had driven by it a few weeks ago and saw that the grand opening was near the end of January.  I decided that today was the day that I would try it out.  Me and my buddy Will from work hopped in my car and drove over here to sample some BBQ.  Plenty of parking outside and we walked in and there was nobody in line.  The place was packed though...all the seating was full.  Good sign!  The first thing I noticed was the little line/partition of wood.  Pretty cool set up and it also shows that this is true BBQ and its smoked low and slow with that same wood!  The place smelled great.  I surveyed the menu really quick and decided on a 2 meat plate.  I went with brisket and pulled pork, mac and cheese and cole slaw as my sides.  This also came with a little cornbread muffin.  They sliced up my brisket, scooped out my pork, boiled my macaroni and dished out my cole slaw.  They packaged it all up, paid and took it to go.  Here is how everything was...............  2 Meat Plate ($14.00)  Brisket-  They give you the option for chopped or sliced brisket.  I chose sliced.  There was not a fatty or lean option so I was not sure what was coming.  Thankfully it was a little mix of both.  It was fall apart tender, smoked proper and pretty delicious.  It was a decent sized portion of it too.  I was impressed.  Not the best I have ever had, but definitely up there and super legit.  No sauce needed.  Pulled Pork-  This was my second choice of meat.  It was seasoned well, moist and tasty.  No sauce needed for this stuff either.  The portion was just a tad skimp compared to the brisket, plus it was the last of it remaining in the container, so maybe it could have even been better?  It was darn good as is though...that has to say something, right?  Mac and Cheese-  When they lifted up the lid of the sides, I saw a vat of what looked like bright yellowish cheese.  It didn't look too appealing at first but then I saw some magic happen.  They actually make each order of mac and cheese on the spot and cook it to order.  They have some noodles in a colander, they boil those to cook them, then transfer them into the vat of cheese and coat them up.  This mac and cheese was legit!  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the cheese sauce they use was very good.  This is a definite must order side from here on out.  The portion was pretty large too.  I love the fact that they use textured spiral noodles too.  It lets the cheese stick to it pretty well! Overall, a great side.  Carolina Cole Slaw-  You have your choice of Carolina (vinegar) or Creamy (mayo) slaw.  I chose the Carolina style.  It was just ok.  It could have used more vinegar or apple cider or whatever they use.  It was kind of bland.  Not bad in any sense, just could have been more kicked up.  I would probably skip it next time and do double mac and cheese.    Cornbread Muffin- Meh.  It wasn't that good.  It had chunks of corn in it which is not my style.  Tasted a little stale too.  Definitely wouldn't pay for one..it came with the plate though.  Overall, I was impressed!  For just over $15.00, you get probably 8-10 ounces of meat (at least) and 2 large sides.  The meat is legit, smoked,  REAL BBQ and the mac and cheese was really good.  I will definitely be back to try out some of their other meats like their ribs and sausage.  The fact that this place had no line at all around 12:20 was awesome too!  I'm sure that will change once word of mouth gets around on how good this place is, but until then, if you need to get some legit BBQ in Deer Valley, this is the spot.  As far as the Phoenix BBQ I have had, this place is way better than Pork on a Fork and just a tad under Little Miss BBQ.  Definitely can't complain though.  This place is legit!

I saw a Menchie's while in Albuquerque and I remember hearing about them previously, also.  I was sitting at work the other day and was on Yelp looking up ice cream places.  This shop popped up and it was only about a 7 minute drive from work.  It was 112 degrees out and I said to myself, "What could be better than some ice cream/frozen yogurt?" Probably not a damn thing in the world!  I got in my car and drove on down.  I walked inside the place and a nice,  friendly lady employee greeted me and asked me if I had ever been here before.  I told her "No." and she ran me through the gambit.  Self serve yogurt and toppings, pay by the ounce, frequent buyer club with bonuses for signing up on their website etc.  She also told me I could sample whatever flavors I wanted to try.  They have tiny dixie cup type cups behind the counter.  You can just grab one and fill up a tiny scoop of yogurt (they are actually decent sized and you get a full bite of yogurt in each sample).  The first one I sampled was "Twisted Cinnamon Churro".  DAMN GINA!  This stuff was delicious!  It tasted just like a churro/cinnamon toast crunch cereal.  I didn't even have to sample anymore (I did actually, but I knew I was getting this cinnamon churro flavor right away).  I filled up my cup with half cinnamon churro and half regular chocolate.  I then made my way over to their toppings bar.  Tons of choices!  I topped my yogurt with some chopped almonds, some graham cracker dust, some Heath bar pieces, and some Reeces peanut butter cups.  I took my creation up to the register and paid the lady my money.  It definitely wasn't cheap per say (almost $7.00), but I felt it was worth it.  It was delicious and a perfect snack on a hot ass day!  I will definitely be back!  Be sure to sign up for their "smiles" club.  $50.00 (50 smiles) spent and you get a $5.00 certificate.  If you sign up online with your phone number to receive specials, you get 25 "smiles" (half way to a $5.00 coupon already!).  If you come back within a week of your first visit, you get another 10 "smiles".  By the time you do that and buy 2-3 yogurts, you basically get one free.  Can't beat that!

I wanted pizza (when do I not?) for lunch and had to also run some errands.  Avondale is not too far from me, so I decided to come down here and check out Pieology.  The ordering process is the same as all the rest of these type of places, so I won't go into too much detail.  I ordered my pizza with meatball, pepperoni, onions, ricotta, garlic and spinach.  I asked for it well done, and about 10 minutes later it was ready.  They bring this out to your table which is nice.  Here is how it was................  Pizza-  The pizza looked pretty good.  I did notice that the crust was really thin along the edges and didn't really have any "body" to it.  I also noticed that they could have used a sharper or more precise pizza cutter.  The pieces were hard to tear apart.  Those were my 2 gripes.  The rest, was all good!  The size of this pizza was huge.  I can usually put down one of these pizzas like its nobody's business, but this one seemed a little larger than all the other places.  I was struggling to get through the last 2 slices.  But, I'm no pussy, so I ate everything on my tray!  The flavors were wonderful!  The pepperonis curled up nice and crisp and had a little pool of grease inside of them.  I loved it and this was the best pepperoni I have encountered at any of these type of pizza places.  It was fantastic!  The other ingredients were really fresh and the flavors were great!  The thin crust surprisingly held up really well, too!   Overall, I thought it was very good!  I will definitely be back because this is probably the closest "do it yourself" type pizza place to my house.  Service was great, price was par for the course (A little over $10.00 for a pizza and a drink (Coke products) isn't bad at all!), and the pizza was delicious!

Pomo opened a place semi close to my house?  West side!  Hell yeah!  I had been to the downtown location once before and thought it was pretty damn delicious (top 5 pizzas in Phoenix...for sure..without a doubt).  I had been meaning to go back,  but life (work, kid, too far, diet etc) gets in the way.  Today I had some free time and decided to check out the new Pomo in Glendale.    I found some parking and walked over.  The building is nice!  They have a nice sized outside patio/bar and then some tables inside.  I chose to sit inside and ordered a water to drink.  I studied the menu for a bit...about that....  I had looked online and had noticed that they have 2 different menus (Phoenix and Scottsdale).  The Phoenix menu had a pizza that had pancetta, onions and black pepper on it called the Amatriciana.  The Scottsdale menu did not have that pizza.  I was craving that particular pizza since I woke up this morning.  Turns out, the Glendale one did not have that particular pizza (amatriciana) either :-(.  I had to go with something else.  I decided on the Diavola.  It is mozzarella, spicy salame and basil.  I placed my order for that, chilled for about 5 minutes and then my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was..............   Diavola- ($13.95)  It looked fantastic!  It had just enough pieces of salame on it, a couple of leaves of basil and then a decent amount of cheese.  A few things about this pizza.  A.)  The "spicy" salame was not too spicy.  It tasted great though!  B.)  I'm usually not the biggest fan of basil on my pizza, but this basil was so tender and delicious and not overpowering.  I loved it!  It worked well with all the other flavors.  C.)  Pomo uses the creamiest mozzarella I have ever had.  In my previous review of the downtown location, I mentioned the same thing.  I don't know where they get this magical cheese from, but it sure is delicious!  It's rich, creamy, salty....just flat out excellent!  My favorite cheese of any pizza in Phoenix!  All of these items were layered perfectly on top of their simple yet delicious tomato sauce.  It is all held together by their excellent crust!  It was perfectly charred but not burnt.  It had a great chew to it.  It was pretty much a perfect pizza.  Can't get much better.  Service was alright.  Not great, not bad, just ok.  I will definitely be back to try out some of their other pizzas!  My stomach was very impressed ;-)

I have tried about every single popular/famous pizza joint in Phoenix, but had never had Oregano's until the other day.  I'm usually a thin crust guy and if I am going to eat Chicago thin crust, I am probably going to Spinato's.  Have been since I moved here and will continue to until I leave.  I have had Spinato's "thick" crust pizza though and it is not good at all.  That brings us to Oregano's.  I was craving a thick pizza and had some options for either their "pan pizza" or their "stuffed pizza".  Reading the descriptions on their website, the stuffed pizza sounded mighty fine!  I placed my order for a 10 inch sausage and onions stuffed pizza.    These stuffed pizzas take about 45 minutes to cook so the lady on the phone told me it would be ready in about an hour.  I waited for awhile and then went down to pick it up (I live in Surprise and it's only about a 15 minute drive down the 303.  It's definitely a lot closer to my house than some of my other favorite pizza joints in Phoenix and surrounding areas.)  I parked, walked in, paid the lady my money (Just over 21.00) and was on my way.  Customer service was excellent at the front counter.  Every employee in there said hi and they even apologized profusely for a slight delay of getting my order.  It wasn't even a delay...there was one dude in front of me ordering yet they still apologized for the wait.  It was sincere too.  It shows that they have excellent customer service standards.  I appreciated it even though it was not needed in the first place!  The girl grabbed my pizza from the warming oven and handed it over.  This thing weighed no less than 4 lbs.  No joke!  This was by far the heaviest pizza I have ever carried!  I drove home and dug in.  Here is how it was............  10 Inch Sausage and Onion Stuffed Pizza-  I opened the box and was immediately impressed!  This pizza looked amazing!  It was a sea of red sauce dusted with some parmesean cheese.  The crust was nice and thick and the whole thing was topped with a few thin slices of onion.  They do not cut this pizza.  If they did, the guts would spill out all over the place.  It had been about 30 minutes after I picked it up so it had some time to settle.  I cut this bad boy into 4 slices.  Each slice must have been at least a pound.  If you are looking for multiple meals, this is definitely your pizza.  A normal person could only eat about 1 slice.  If you are a fat ass and/or starving, you might be able to eat 2.  I grabbed a spatula and picked up a piece and put it on my plate and dug in.  Wow!  This pizza was delicious!  They use tons of Wisconsin cheese, they use a ton of sausage (kind of like a huge sausage patty) which you get some in every bite, and then some sliced up onions too.  The onions were a tad skimp and that is about the only bad thing I can say about this pizza.  The crust was nice and buttery and flaky.  It was damn near perfect.  I was stuffed after one slice and proceeded to eat the remaining 3 slices over the next few mornings for breakfast.    If I ever want a deep dish pizza, I know where I'm coming!  It will be hard to stray away from the stuffed pizza.  It was pretty much perfection and the value was awesome because you can get so many meals out of it.  Pair that with great customer service, and this is a 5 star joint in my book.  I couldn't imagine a better stuffed pizza out there (at least in AZ...Chicago, maybe lol).  I will be back for sure!

Another great cigar bar!  I headed on down here for my birthday and had a great time.  Fox has a decent sized humidor, really good prices on cigars (less than other places I have been) and a super laid back atmosphere.  The ventilation could have been a tad better, but it was still pretty decent.  The chairs were comfy, there were tons of Tvs, and the guy working behind the counter was extremely helpful, friendly and on top of everything.  I really enjoyed my hour here and would not hesitate to come back again if I was near Scottsdale!

So....my coworker who sits directly across from me comes here all the time.  Everything he had brought back has looked good, so I decided that I needed to check it out.  I drove down today, parked, walked in and scoped out the menu for a minute.  I saw a "California Burrito" and it was calling my name.  I lived in the land of California Burritos (San Diego) for about 10 years, so I was hoping that Chronic Tacos version could come close to what I was used to.    I stood there and talked with Andy for a few minutes while he was waiting for the fries to finish (freshly fried fries...good start to any CA burrito) and then we got down to business.  They stick a flour tortilla between a little press to warm it up.  The fries were layered perfectly, and then Andy started hooking up my burrito with the carne asada.  I went with a pretty traditional CA burrito (carne asada, fries, cotija and jack cheese, a little pico, sour cream and guacamole).  This burrito was fat!  Paid Andy my money (10% off with Yelp check in!) and took it back to work.  Here is how it was............  California Burrito-  The sheer size of this thing was impressive!  It was a beast!  I took it to go and I had about a 15 minute drive back to work, so I couldn't eat it immediately.  I think if I would have ate it there in the shop, it would have been a little bit better.  The fries had time to settle and weren't as crispy as they looked coming out of the fryer.  The carne asada was just a tad dry and had a little different type of seasoning on it.  It was good, but not great.  The rest of the ingredients were very good though.  Melted cheese, a ton of guacamole and sour cream.  It was a pretty solid CA burrito.  Best burrito I have had so far in AZ (that's not saying a whole lot lol!)  Overall, I thought it was pretty good.  If this was in San Diego, this would be a 3 star burrito.  Because it's in AZ, it gets a 3.5-4 star review.  Customer service was excellent.  Andy thanked me for coming in and said that he hoped to see me again soon.  He said that he loves seeing repeat customers and recognizable faces.  I appreciated that and I'm sure at some point when I am craving a burrito, I will make my way back down here.  There are other things on the menu I would like to try out.

This Winco just opened last week while we were in CA.  This place opened right across the street from Albertsons and right next door to Safeway.  Competition at its finest!  Their concept seems pretty cool.  Employee owned and low prices.  Sounded good.  We drove down here today to check it out.  It was my first time in a Winco.  Parking was a bit of an issue.  We had to park way in the back of the parking lot.  Not too big of a deal but in this AZ heat, whenever you have to park far away, that means your cold items will be exposed to the heat for longer...even if its an extra minute or two, that can wreak havoc on certain things!  We made our way through the parking lot, grabbed a cart near the front and walked in.  It immediately reminded me of Food 4 Less.  You have to walk in and take a right.  They have all their deals of the week in this little section and then you wind up in the produce area.  The layout of the rest of the store was alright.  There were a lot of areas that were super clusterfucked but that was partly due to idiots who have no sense of their surroundings and no common courtesy to push their cart to the side of the aisle.  Lot of assholes in this world.  Anyways.........My two favorite parts of the store were.  1.  Prices!  Their prices were significantly lower than other grocery stores and on par with or even lower cost than Walmart prices.  They have their competitors prices marked on signs as well so you can definitely tell how much you are saving.  They had the huge cardboard box of Goldfish crackers for only $6.00.  It's at least $8.00 everywhere else.  They had their own brand of nacho cheese tortilla chips for $.48 cents.  Yup... not even 50 cents for a regular large size bag of chips.  They weren't the best things ever and don't compare with actual real Dorritos, but for $.48 cents, they can't be beat! 2.  Bulk Bin Items.  They have everything from coffee, nuts, candy, spices, flour, peanut butter, dog food etc.  Pretty much anything you can think of.  My wife got a pound of white sugar for like $.50 cents.  I will definitely be back to utilize these bulk bins.  We got a lot of things for a great price.  You bag your own groceries which is cool with me.  If it saves on cost, I'll do it.  Prices are so low that they don't carry EVERYTHING (they didn't have my favorite hot sauce or coffee), but most major brands they will have in stock.   Open 24-7 which is awesome. Cash or debit card only...they don't accept credit cards.  We will definitely be back!

4.5 stars  I have passed this Portillo's many times.  If I am headed down this way, it is usually down the street a few more miles to go to Ted's.  My intent was to get some dogs at Ted's again today but when I pulled off the 202 and McClintock, I had a strong craving for Portillo's cheese fries.  Something about that magical cup of hot, melted cheese sauce reeled me in.  I finally figured out the perfect order at Portillo's.  2 Jumbo Dogs and a Large Cheese Fries.  This comes in at just under $10.00 and it is well worth it.  I have had other things at Portillo's (sausages, Italian beef, salads, etc) but nothing is as good as their Jumbo Hot Dogs.  I get mine topped with mustard, onion and that neon green relish.  They are a hefty sized dog with a little bit of a snap to them.  These dogs are laid in a nicely steamed poppy seed bun. They are flat out delicious and filling!  For their fries, they use a crinkle cut fry.  They aren't the best fries in the world but because of the crinkle cut design, they are the perfect fry to dip in that molten lava cheese sauce.  It coats all the nooks and crannies of the fry and makes it one hell of a dip!  I'm sure I will be back soon enough!  Service was very attentive and friendly and this place is pretty easy to get to.  The parking lot is a little confusing if you aren't paying attention, but if you can navigate that and get inside the door, great hot dogs and cheese fries are waiting for you!

This place is within walking distance of my house (Not right now though...114 degrees out...are you kidding?  I'm not walking ANYWHERE!  Anyways....) but I had never been here until yesterday.  I wanted to go out to lunch, but didn't want to go very far in this heat.  I decided that I would drive down here and get a BBQ sandwich.  I walked inside, got in line and then changed my mind.  Instead of a sandwich,  I saw that they had a "Meat Plate" for $10.00 which included ribs and brisket.  I decided to go with that and an order of beans.  Total was right around $13.00.  The owner and ladies behind the counter were very nice!  Here is how the BBQ was............  Meat Plate-  This thing was supposed to come with 2 ribs and some brisket.  It wound up being 4 ribs (a little small) and a nice pile of brisket.  I got my brisket on the "not so lean side".  Sauce is served on the side.  I took a bite of the ribs first.  They were excellent!  They had a dry rub on them, mostly salt and pepper.  They were delicious!  Some of the better ribs I have had in AZ and the rub they use is great!  The ribs had a nice smokey flavor.  I dug into the brisket next.  I'm usually not the biggest fan of brisket, but this stuff was definitely legit and pretty damn tasty.  I ate some bites without sauce, and it was great.  I added some sauce to it (didn't even really need it) and it enhanced it a little bit more.  Definitely some good brisket! Compared to other BBQ in the Phoenix area, I would say it is much better than Rudy's, on par with Naked BBQ but not as good as Little Miss BBQ (there is nothing wrong with that...Little Miss may be the best BBQ in the Western half of the USA).   Beans-  I'm not going to mince words.  They were nasty!  They were more like "ranch beans" in a sauce.  The sauce was more savory and not sweet at all.  I am pretty picky with my beans and prefer a nice thick sauce, meat in them, and sweet.  These beans had none of that going on.  I would never get them again.  I took 2 bites and threw them in the trash.  Overall, besides the beans, the meats were great!  Maybe not the best BBQ I have ever had, but definitely above average and super close to home.  Prices were fair for what you receive, customer service was friendly, plus you are supporting a local business.  Win win.  I'm sure I will be back to finally try out that sandwich I initially intended to eat.

DANG!  This place was awesome!  My son Bill has 2 best buddies (Vincent and Liam).  Vincent's mom Jackie, texted my wife that they were going to get out of the house and check out this citrus farm where you could pick your own fruit.  We decided to join them and met them there around 10:00am.  This place is only a few miles from our house so it made it super convenient to head on down.  When you are driving down Greenway, take it all the way West until it ends.  There will be signs that guide you the rest of the way.  It looks like it almost doesn't belong.  You are driving along, nothing but dirt and desert, but then you come to the entrance and see acres and acres of citrus trees!  You park outside, walk through the fence and then head over to the main "stand".  First, you grab a map.  Then you walk up to tables full of all the fruit available, WITH samples. There were about 20 different samples on display.  This was really helpful because it let you visually see what each type looked like, and what each type tasted like.  I had a fair share of samples and knew what I mainly wanted.  Next, you go and choose your bag.  $10.00 for 15 lbs of fruit, or $20.00 for 40 lbs of fruit.  We split the cost and got the bigger bag.  You pay Mr. Truman your money (cash or check ONLY), he hands you your bag, you grab a wheelbarrow if need be, and a pole to pick the fruit, and you are on your way.   Be sure to look at the map!  I started wandering around (even though Mr. Truman told me to look at the map lol ;-) haha) and eventually stopped for a minute, looked at the map, found out where I was, and then was back on my way.  There are SO MANY different varieties here, I would recommend you pick out 4-5 things you like best, then go straight to them.  There was pretty much infinite fruit!  We mostly filled up on Redblush Pink Grapefruit, Meyer Lemons, and Rhode Red Valencia Oranges.  It was really fun walking around the fields, and using the long stick to grab and pick fruit off the trees!  Good times were had by all!   Can't say enough about this place.  Not really sure what I am going to do with 20 lbs of citrus, but I'll be damned if it wasn't worth every single penny.  All the fruit is fresh as could be, the owner of the place was very informative and nice, plus it was a great way to spend a morning.  I would recommend getting there pretty early though.  It started to get a little warm out, plus all the poles/pickers were gone by the time we were returning ours (11:00am).  I'm 100% positive we will be back soon enough.  This is a cool spot you could take out of town visitors to.  Plus...with all this citrus, you know damn well you won't be getting scurvy!  That in itself, is worth the trip out here!  Scurvy Free 2016!  Do it!

So, I had a real bad case of chlamydia and I needed to see someone fast!  I wasn't sure if I could make it here in time to cure what ailed me.  Ouch, it burns!  KIDDING!  Just seeing if you were paying attention ;-).  Seriously though, the wife has been sick for going on 2 weeks, and I started feeling like crap last Wednesday.  Every night, my throat would swell up, and I had a nasal drip in the back of my throat.  It was super annoying but not to the point of not being able to sleep.  Every morning though, I felt like complete crap!  My throat was incredibly dry and raw and it took a super hot shower, a few glasses of water, some Dayquil and a couple of loogies to finally feel somewhat ok.  I work four 10 hour shifts at work and I am answering phones all day.  Sore throat and constant talking do not mix!  Today, I finally had enough!  I took a half day at work and needed to see someone to try and get my throat fixed, asap!     I don't have a primary doctor in Arizona, yet.  I saw this MedPost being built last year and it finally opened a couple of months ago.  It is about a 3 minute drive from my house and is very conveniently located near the Walmart right off the 303 and Waddell.  I looked them up online, booked an appointment (minimal questions asked on the online form) for 3:30pm and made my way down here.  I arrived, checked in, filled out 4 pages of paperwork (simple..nothing too detailed), made my copay and was led back to the room all within less than 10 minutes after I arrived.  Very quick!  I saw a nurse who took my vitals, swabbed my throat to see if I had strep throat, told me to hang tight and that a doctor would be with me shortly.  A PA/Doctor came in, asked what was wrong, looked me over pretty quick, checked my strep throat test (did not have it, thank goodness), then left to write me a prescription.  He gave me some antibiotics and a steroid to take for the next 5 days.  He said someone would follow up on me in a few days to see how I was feeling.    That was it!  Total time in the office was less than 30 minutes.  Way better/faster than going to a doctor.  Sure, the copay is $15.00 more than a general doctors visit, but this place gets you in and out super quick, gets you what you need to get better AND everyone was incredibly helpful and friendly.  The receptionist was nice, the nurse was friendly and thorough, and the doctor listened to what I needed and got me taken care of right away.  I am glad to know that this place is within walking distance of my house in case I need anything else in the future.  Next time my herpes starts acting up, I know where to come!  KIDDING, again!  Hit you in the first paragraph and now in the last!  Seriously though....this place was great!  Couldn't have asked for an easier doctors visit!

So......I saw that this food truck event was going on, plus they were looking for some Yelp folks to be judges.  I'm pretty antisocial and usually wouldn't venture out to something like this (food is too expensive, I'm not a big fan of crowds in confined spaces, its just not really my style), but the free food, the possibility to meet some new Yelp friends, and the semi closeness to Surprise lured me in.  I was told that we should arrive at 11, check in, then we would meet at noon and start to sample some food and judge things.  I got there early, found parking off of Myrtle street, and headed on over to the event.  Once I got there, chaos ensued lol.  Coming up next will be how I thought it was going to go, and then, what actually happened.   A. How I thought it was going to go. B. How it really went down.  The Check In  A.  I thought I would get there at 11am, head to a booth labeled "Yelp", check in, get my tickets, and sample some food.  B.  I walked up to a tent and saw a massive line of people standing in line.  I walked up to a lady and asked her, "Is this where you check in for the Yelp event?".  Blank stare....she had no idea of what the fuck I was talking about.  I didn't feel like waiting in line if I wasn't sure, so I wandered around for a bit and saw another tent with a smaller line.  I jumped in that line and was hoping for the best.  During that time, I ran into one of my Yelp buddies, Tim, and said hello and introduced myself.  He was hanging with some other Yelp folks so we kind of banded together, all the while, not sure where to go and where to check in.  Finally, someone got word that we had to go check in at a specific place.  We made it there, had to sign a waiver (sure hope I don't choke to death on a chicken wing!) and then were instructed to go and hang out by the amphitheater.  A group of about 25 or so Yelp folks were all hanging out waiting for further instructions.  Finally at about 12:15 or so, one of the organizers comes over and tells us how it will work.  We will get 10 tickets to "sample" foods and one drink ticket.  He said that we should have priority (Yelpers) over the rest of the line and that we should tell the vendors we are Yelp people.  (Isn't that EXACTLY what South Park was making fun of?  Being "Elite" and letting everyone know it to get special treatment?  lol!).  That's just not my style.  Anyways... He wanted us to order our "samples", then bring them back to the amphitheater and eat them there, vote, and then a camera crew was going to interview us?  We finally got our tickets and were set free!  The Food  A.  Armed with my 10 tickets, I thought I would head to an area designated for this Yelp challenge.  There, they would have most of the food vendors, with their sample portions of their food to try, I would vote on them, and then be done.  B.  Pandemonium!  I walked around and was instantly bored/pissed/frustrated.  The intent of the food trucks was good (They intended...again repeat, intended to have 3 lines.  One for VIP, one for just "samples" and one for purchasing of food).  The line system just didn't work out though.  There were no strings or barricades or anything resembling any sort of line A, B, C.  It was just one long ass line at each vendor! I noticed that a lot of the trucks didn't even have "samples" or they had "already ran out".  How do you run out of samples an hour into a food truck event?  99% of the people there either had purchased advance tickets, or Groupons or something that included tickets for "samples".  Amidst all the chaos, I finally found 2 samples that I tried.  The first one was a blood orange sorbet from LuLus.  It was good, but skimp.  It was like a dixie cup full or sorbet.  I wandered around some more and was about to have a panic attack because of the clusterfuck of people the huge lines to get a dixie cup full of whatever.  My next, and last sample was from a cinnamon roll truck.  I gave the guy my ticket and he told me to help myself to a sample on the tray.  Their "samples" were literally like 1/30th of a cinnamon roll.  It was the skimpest and most weak sample I have ever seen in my life.  It wasn't even hot and didn't even taste that good.  Thank God it was free with my ticket.  If I had to pay $2.00 (That's what each sample ticket cost if you purchased them), for that pinky size piece of cinnamon roll, I would have lost my shit.  Anyways........ after wandering around for a bit more and seeing the insane lines everywhere, I called it a day.  I ran into some of the people I was hanging out with earlier, gave them my remaining tickets and was out!  I went across the street to La Piazza Al Forno and got a pizza.  At least the day ended well with that!    This was a horrible event and I hate to bitch about free stuff, but I have to!  The only positive thing I can say,  is that I got to meet some new Yelp friends that were cool!  That's about it.  I would never come back to this event ever again.  It was whack!

I was sitting at home last night, and a major fish taco craving hit me.  There aren't any good fish taco places in Surprise (If there are, please let me know where to go!), so I knew I had to take a drive to go find some.  I had Tortilla Fish bookmarked and decided that I would head on down here when I woke up this morning.  I left my place in Surprise at about 10:30 and arrived down here just after they opened.    I walked in, studied the menu for a brief second and then placed my order.  I went with a Fish Taco, a Shrimp Taco, a Full Taco, and a Carne Asada Taco.  Tortilla Fish has a great Yelp check in offer, too....a free large drink!  Score!  Total for 4 tacos was just over $13.00.  The tacos come plain here and you dress them up yourself.  I went over to the do it yourself salsa bar and started getting some of my fixins together.  Speaking of fixins'....watch this Youtube clip from Eastbound and Down on HBO.  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG97kfnaFOA).  About 10 minutes later, my food was ready (Everything is cooked fresh to order).  Here is how everything was..........  Fish Taco-  This thing looked pretty good!  They chop up their pieces of fish here, so you get a full taco which would probably equate to 2 decent sized whole pieces of fish.  I dressed mine with some cabbage, some onions, some lime and a little bit of hot sauce. It tasted pretty good.  It had a nicely fried batter on it and the fish was nice and flaky.  The tortillas they use are pretty good and overall it was a solid fish taco.  4 stars!  Carne Asada Taco-  Eh...just ok.  The carne asada was pretty tender, but it didn't have a smokey, char grilled flavor that I prefer in my carne asada.  It wasn't bad in anyway, just average.  The best part about it was the tortillas...double wrapped flour tortillas!  I would not get this from here again.  3 stars!  Shrimp Taco-  Same style as the Fish Taco...they chop up the shrimp into smaller pieces and stuff the taco full of them! I dressed this one the same as my fish taco (cabbage, onions, some lime and hot sauce.)  I liked this one a tad better than the fish.  Both were good, but if I had to pick only one between the two, I would take the shrimp! 4.5 stars!  Full Taco-  Boom!  The Winner!  This taco is a combo of both fish and shrimp along with a yellow pepper that was stuffed with cheese.  This thing looked awesome!  It had all this oozing cheese on top as well as the chopped up pepper.  It kind of reminded me of the La Super Rica Especial from La Super Rica up in Santa Barbara (their version is a pasilla chile with cheese and adobada), but with seafood instead.  This taco came with 2 tortillas under it, so I made 2 tacos out of it.  I didn't even top this one with anything...just kept it plain, and it was fantastic!  The combo of the fried seafood, crunch of the pepper, and the melted cheese made this a fantastic taco.  When I come back, I think I will order 2 or 3 of these and call it a day.  By far, the best taco of the day!  5 stars!   Overall, I was pretty impressed. Skip the carne asada and stick with the fish and shrimp offerings.  The tacos were very good, the service was excellent, and the free drink (Coke products) with check in was a nice bonus!  This place is a bit far from my house, so unfortunately, I don't think I will be coming back often.  With that said though, if I have a strong fish taco craving, I know where to come!  I'm sure I will be back at some point!

So...I went to the OG location down on Indian School a few months back, and had a pretty good pizza.  I saw that they had opened up a new spot here downtown, and I decided to swing by before my Cardinals vs Diamondbacks game.    I arrived a little after 4:30 and was one of two people in the place (other guy was sitting at the bar).  There were a ton of workers hanging out prepping the restaurant and getting everything ready for the dinner rush (if there was one?).  I knew what I was going to order before I even came in, so when my waitress came over, I ordered a glass of water and a Calabrese Pizza.  A little while later, my pizza was ready.  Here is how it was....................  Calabrese Pizza-  This was a white pizza and it came with house-pulled mozzarella, parmesan, taleggio, caramelized onions, sweet sausage, calabrian chiles, extra virgin olive oil and some basil.  It was delicious!  The sweet sausage was fantastic!  I ate a few pieces by itself, and it was spot on...just a great sweet Italian sausage!  The caramelized onions added some more sweetness on top of the sausage.  The mozzarella was nice and rich, and the calabrian chiles added a little "pop" to each bite.  All these delicious flavors were thrown upon a nice thin, charred crust.  It was thin, but not so thin that your slice would droop.  You could pick up each slice and enjoy it without knife and fork.  I dusted that pizza off in no time and was ready for the bill.  About that.............  The Calabrese pizza is normally $16.00.  When my waitress brought me my bill, it rang up at only $13.00.  I am assuming that pizzas are $3.00 off during Happy Hour?  I didn't ask, I kept my mouth shut and left my waitress a $20.00.    Service was excellent!  My waitress was very friendly and personable, and never let my water get below half full.  The space where they created this restaurant is pretty cool, too!  I'm sure I will be back at some point.  The pizza is pretty damn good and its right down near Chase Field and Talking Stick so its convenient to grab a bite to eat here before heading to a game.

4.5 stars!   I got off work the other night and was going to get myself some grub.  It was either going to be a Sonoran hot dog, or some tacos.  Tacos won!  I had seen this place pop up on Yelp recently, and it wasn't too far from work.  I drove down, parked in the lot, walked up to the podium and placed my order.  There are only 2 choices here...carne asada and al pastor.  You can get a taco, quesadilla, or mulita.  I went with 3 carne asada tacos, 3 al pastor tacos and a Coke to drink.  Total was right under $12.00.  I took a seat at one of their tables, and about 15 minutes later, my tacos were ready.  Here is how they were...........  Carne Asada-  These come with carne asada, onions, guacamole and cabbage (It's a Phoenix thing...the cabbage.  I got mine without cabbage!).  These tacos are a bit small (2 biters) but they were delicious.  The carne asada had a great smokey flavor, and was tender as could be.  The meat is piled onto a home made corn tortilla.  The tortillas were a bit chewier/wet than some of my favorite taco stands, but they were still good!  Some of the best carne asada I have found so far in Phoenix.  4 stars!  Al Pastor-  Wow!  Topped the same as the carne asada tacos.  They have the spit of pork roasting in the truck, and they slice it right off of there into the tortilla.  First bite in, these tacos tasted IDENTICAL to my favorite spot in San Diego (Tacos El Gordo).  This al pastor was legit as fuck!  Just like the carne asada tacos, they were a bit skimp on the meat, but they also only cost $1.50.  Flavor wise though, damn good and these could hold their own compared to other great al pastor places in San Diego and Tijuana.  5 stars!  Coke- Mexican Coke in a glass bottle.  The best!  Overall, I was very impressed!  The tacos were damn good and were some of the best tacos I have had so far in Phoenix.  Only complaint is that it took awhile to get your food, and the tacos were a tad skimp on the meat.  Other than those 2 small gripes, flavor wise and authenticity were pretty much perfect!  I now know where to get my late night taco fix at!
