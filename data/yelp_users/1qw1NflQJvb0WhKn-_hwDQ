I have been looking for a new groomer for two years and have had bad experiences until now! I just picked up my Lil maltipom and she was happy and beautiful!  I'm so impressed by the great job that the groomer Maria did I appreciated the way she took time to listen to what I wanted and executed it perfectly! I'm so happy with the results. I'm definitely coming back!

Dear Lo-Lo's why do you have to be so damn good!?  I really wish that when I had you last weekend you had been dry and tasteless so that I wouldn't have to come back and eat Fried Chicken and Waffles again... but now you have made me an addict to your delicious mouth-watering juicy breasts & thighs... Woah where is this going?! LOL Thank goodness you do takeout for now my husband will have to do his husbandly duty and pick me up a piece or two on his way home from work....   Truly wonderful... I never had waffles with fried chicken before and I'm not sure why I was so surprised at how great this pairing would be but I was... Great service, everyone was friendly and upbeat and seemed to actually enjoy working there which is definitely a PLUS! ;-) I love you Lo-lo's!

Yup, I like what I see and what I like seeing is real homemade corn tortillas on a parilla! Parilla Suiza keep it goin' you're doing something right! I haven't been disappointed yet.  I enjoy the tacos with carne asada, the parillada was huge and that arroz & beans... mmm... rico.  So the only thing I noted changed on my last trip was a re-vamp o the menu... Originally I was a bit disappointed that they now have a burger and ribs on their menu... nothing about that is Mexican but HEY we are in AMERICA baby and in America we enjoy a good burger or ribs now and then, so... why not!? Although I haven't given them a whirl... nor will I because my trip to La Parilla is strictly about the Comida Mexicana!  Thumbs up Parilla keep those corn tortillas coming!

My husband introduced me to this place and I can't get enough of their egg rolls! I love the fresh ingredients used and the simplicity of the dishes. Yum. The servers are extremely nice and always helpful in case I need advice on something to eat! ;)  John is always a pleasure so hopefully you'll get the chance to have him serve you! But either way everyone here is wonderful!

Pho sho! This place was really good! I'm actually not a huge pho fan but I went here on a rare chilly day in the valley and I was pleasantly surprised. Combo #52 bun dac biet and the spring rolls were amazingly good and totally comforting, and holy huge portions!! I also couldn't get away without trying the pork egg rolls, there's something so fun about eating Vietnamese egg rolls! If you've never had them I say, DO IT! But people please do it right! First take that crispy roll and wrap it in the lettuce with the fresh cilantro and herbs then dip and devour!  You can thank me later. Ps the staff was so sweet if you aren't familiar with the cuisine they'll help you out. I'm glad I went and it won't be the last time!

I'm sorry Sprinkles... I really REALLY wanted to like you... I tried and tried but I couldn't do it. I've now had six different cupcakes from Sprinkles and didn't enjoy any of them... NOW the Strawberry frosting was delish, but the cake portion was just not up to par to that delicious frosting. ;-( Sad to say I'll stick to more local bakeries going forward!

I go to the pink house about once every couple of weeks or so and they always have new things in there.  I'm a big fan of sugar skulls so I enjoy that they have a whole area dedicated to them! (Lady Muerta section) Definitely a place to stop while you walk around downtown Glendale!

Truly the best pizza I've had so far in AZ. Reminded me of NY pizza, thin crust... and crusty! I could eat this crust alone it's so good!..   In fact I did!!! Ate it with a little olive oil and it was yuyuyummy! Also had the antipasti, so glad they actually give you REAL antipasti and not a mesh of crazy salad... you have to try this place if you haven't already.  My husband and I got a small pizza and had enough to take home for leftovers... and we are BIG eaters! RICO!!!

Just not really impressed by this place... I like tacos like all other red blooded Arizonians BUT eh... I've had better. This was nothing more than another Mexican-American Fast food place Also I was surprised this was pretty pricey in my opinion especially since you can get the same thing at any of the million "___bertos" drive thru taco joints and cheaper (Filbertos,Humbertos,Losbertos, etc.) ... ;-( Sorry Senor, I won't be back.

Yum, tacos... Ok the thing that stood out the most was how fresh everything was. The salsa bar..a definite plus... I love a good salsa... My favorite the Strawberry Salsa.  Wholy cow was that good! The quesadilla was bigger than I've ever seen I couldn't finish it!!  Loved, loved loved the artwork, The only negative I could find was that the furniture for some reason felt a little awkward like I was in everyone's way while they were trying to get in line to order, but that really has nothing to do with the food.  I'm givin' this place a thumbs up... authentic and delicioso!

I love Zing. Seriously I eat there all the time.  The burgers are perfectly spiced, juicy and meaty! I always get tiger sauce for my fries and it's so good. (If you like spicy food) Last week I had the philly cheese steak (it was a special on the menu for the week) SO GOOD! Brought it home and ate it alone so nobody could see me pig out on this one! LOL.  I enjoy American food when it's done right and Zing does it right! - P.S- I even had a salad once...OMG BEST croutons I've had in my LIFE!

Finally a hot dog with a snap in it's bite! The true sign of a good dog.  We enjoyed the Aiko and Moki, both were delicious, the mango chutney was a perfect little sweet compliment to the meaty hot dog.  The flat bread is a great idea because you can really wrap this guy up and enjoy it as you walk around the market! Price was right, I mean $5 for a hot dog might seem a bit high for some but this is a BIG DOG! definitely worth it.  The only criticism I might have is that we had one person come up to us when we were going to order and ask us if they sold dog food in the truck... I guess because of the big dog painted on it with a short leash! LOL! but seriously it was a great gourmet style hot dog! We'll be back to try some other combinations! P.S- The extra touch to remember our names while we were there was nice! Good clean and friendly service.

If I wasn't married I might ask the chef to marry me! This is the first time that I've had a simple salad and liked so much I actually ate the whole thing.  I don't usually eat salad when out as I tend to splurge but I really needed something fresh that day. So while my husband ordered the steak burrito I got the cajun steak salad. It was a very simple salad, romaine, cheese, steak, tomatoes.  But this was exactly why this was so good the chef used  simple fresh ingredients, nothing overly complicated here except for the perfectly spiced steak which is what took this salad to a five star review. WOW amazing flavor.  My husband loved his steak jamburrito and couldn't control letting everyone know about it.  We went back a week later and were so impressed we are now contemplating becoming Jamburrito stalkers! We will definitely be back!  Thanks Chef Great fusion cooking. -
