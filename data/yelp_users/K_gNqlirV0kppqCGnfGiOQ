This Costco is the location I frequent most since I moved to the neighborhood three years ago. Admittedly, it is not the prettiest-looking store in the best neighborhood, but it is conveniently located, clean, and has a bonus gas station, pharmacy, optical/hearing centers, and tire service center.  Since the parking has been addressed in other reviews, I'll add my $.02:  Most parking lots are positioned perpendicular to their corresponding store. While Costco's lot design is terrible, the standard corner entryway they employ works well here. Wrapping the parking lot around a corner of the building effectively extends the parking to two sides of the building rather than one. This creates more spaces near the entry/exit. In August when I have purchased perishables, I am appreciative of this.  My various customer service dealings over the past few years have all been positive experiences that left me feeling good about my loyalty to Costco and the Kirkland brand. Associates quickly handle returns without hassle, I am usually able to find an associate on the floor if I have a question, and it appears this particular location employs individuals on the long-term as familiar faces regularly greet me.  Where quality is concerned, I shop with confidence at Costco. The offerings go way beyond the trusted brands and I value the ability to sample food items before buying. The Kirkland house brand never disappoints and I swear their flowers last longer than any other florists' bouquet!

Since the positives outweigh the negatives by a considerable amount, I'll get it out of the way and say that if Trader Joe's had a more extensive meat department it would be a one-stop-shop for me.   The store brand quality never disappoints, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and prices are very affordable. That you're greeted by their beautiful selection of flowers, herbs, and other types of foliage and later welcomed to try one of their delicious concoctions cooking in the back is just icing on this mindful preparation of grocery and household offerings.   The store is always clean and while it's usually crowded at the times I visit, I'm rarely bothered. A friendly place like Trader Joe's seems to attract friendly patrons. If my bright blue insulated tote happens to bump into your bright blue insulated tote while I'm deliberating over the vast cheese or nuts selections, we'll probably exchange smiles instead of middle fingers.  The folks who work here are approachable and extremely helpful. While I don't regularly drink wine, I find it a nice touch that a personable sommelier is available in the event I need a crash course on pairing and someone can recommend a high fiber cereal.  Some of my favorite products:  -Salsa Authentica -Cowboy Cavier -Vegan trail mix cookies -All-in-one facial cleanser -Cruciferous crunch -Coconut cashews -TJ's brand almond milk -Spinach and fontina chicken sausage -Spicy peanut vinaigrette -Roasted red pepper soup

Ingleside's new location is a clean, beautiful space with an abundance of natural light and high-tech goodies. Each patient room is equipped with a computer terminal and moveable monitor so the vet techs and doctors can go over the digital x-rays and billing information with you. The entire staff is extremely warm and it is apparent they love what they do. During the multiple visits surrounding my cat's recent surgery, my pets were handled with great care and affection.  Due to the nature of my cat's illness, exploratory surgery was necessary to remove a blockage in his intestines. All costs and options were reviewed with me up-front and the staff handled my first-time cat owner questioning with ease. I never felt rushed and at no time was the experience stressful for my cat or me. The recommended treatment options were not bloated with unnecessary costs and measures were taken to ensure cost-effectiveness. When I asked for a copy of my cat's x-rays to share with my cat-savvy brother-in-law, the tech cheerfully provided a CD of his x-rays for me to take home. Also, the doctors and techs made several follow-up calls to me during my cat's recovery and I appreciate that level of personal communication.   The only complaint I have is the building is set back quite a ways from the street (Thomas) and their sign is not very prominent, making it easy to pass. On the other hand, if this is a strategic means of keeping animals far away from a main street, I'm all for it.  Overall, this is the best vet I have ever been to and I would give them 10 stars if I could!

Cliff and Craig took very good care of me and my 2008 Honda Civic and made a long-time customer out of me.  After having my oil changed at a shop down the street that quoted me in excess of $400 for a myriad of recommended repairs, I asked Brake Masters for a second opinion.   First and foremost, the customer service was phenomenal. The wait wasn't long to inspect and clean my brakes, flush the transmission fluid, and replace my air filters. The team communicated often concerning their findings and the cost was much less than the first shop. They saved me a brake job, power steering flush, money, and more importantly, time. I felt as though they valued my patronage and sought to provide the best service possible -- an invaluable yield for any service provider.

I brought a pepperoni pie home from Pat's once and it was completely forgettable. The sauce was average and, like the cheese, not plentiful enough. It wasn't any better cold the next day.

Admittedly, I didn't have time to shop around and when my insurance provider informed me their preferred shops guarantee their work for as long as you own the vehicle, I figured it was worth a shot to go with their recommendation.  At first glance, Gerber makes a good impression with well-kept grounds, a clean and modestly furnished lobby, and accessible staff in pressed uniforms. A coffee pot brews in the waiting area for guests and bottled water is available upon request.   My adjuster conveniently worked out of this shop and I was in and out for my estimate in about 3o minutes. I appreciate the relationship Gerber has established with a variety of insurers to bring ease to an already frustrating experience.  I was told the parts for my vehicle would be ordered ahead of time and I could bring my SUV back when they arrived to avoid unnecessary downtime. I do not carry rental car insurance, but Gerber stepped up to the plate and paid up to $20/day for a rental with Enterprise, whom they also have an established relationship. On the day I brought my vehicle in for an expected 5-7 day repair, Enterprise met me at the shop and drove me to their lot to pick-up a car.    4 days later, my car was ready. A slight shimmy in the wheel brought me back to the shop.  Gerber picked up the tab for another rental so I wouldn't be car-less for the few hours it took them to correct the issue.   I primarily dealt with Brian Hinton, who followed up with a phone call the next day to make sure all was well. Awesome customer service, fair pricing, fast turnaround, and professional from start to finish. This place knows how to earn and retain customers, including this one.

I've given up finding the best pizza in town because, quite frankly, sometimes I'm in the mood for fold-it-in-half NY style pizza and other times I crave something more refined. Venezia's does NY style right, with a consistency that has yet to disappoint.  The menu offers a nice variety, touting the usual toppings and pizza variations (calzones, stromboli, etc.). Add to that tasty salads, wings, and sandwiches made with Boarshead meats.  Their combo specials make Venezia's an affordable lunch option. For the carnivores, go on Wednesdays to try out my personal favorite, the Italian Stallion. Otherwise, the Greek salad is also delicious.   The fountain and tea offerings are abundant. TVs are tuned in to sports channels. The staff is friendly and the seating is generous:  booths and tables with a handful of larger booths for parties of 4+. Lunch is busy, but I've never found myself without a place to sit. Venezia's is situated in a strip mall with limited seating outside and plenty of parking.

Over the last 5 years or so, I've eaten lunch at Dilly's Deli a couple dozen times. The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior d√©cor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today's trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I've never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad.   Carrying Boar's Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn't work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I've tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed.   I've eaten one salad at Dilly's - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven't ordered a salad there since.   As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren't as piping hot as I'd like, though the variety and additional "daily soup" is appreciated.   The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you're accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.  The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own.  Today I gave Dilly's another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I'm not a fan. The Blazin' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.  Dilly's is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.  Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.

With recent winnings from a nearby casino, I purchased my first Coach purse and wallet at this store. Set in the beautiful Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, The Coach Store doesn't disappoint and offers a nice selection.  The store, itself, is beautifully designed with bright lighting and an open layout that is easy to navigate. Collections were displayed together, making it easy to compare styles and materials once I discovered the look I liked.  The staff was knowledgeable and helpful, but a little presumptuous and slightly aggressive. After commenting about a particular purse I liked, the salesman asked another employee to bring a brand new one up to the register from the back room. I perused the store for an additional 20 minutes and he continued to interrupt my browsing by approaching me frequently with multiple purses hanging from his arms, none of which had qualities I expressed were important to me.   Had the salesman given me more space, it'd be a 5-star review.

I've eaten in and done take-out from here, always a burger and fries. The burgers are fantastic and both the regular and sweet potato fries are delicious. Order a basket (or 1/2 basket) of mixed if you can't decide. The low rating is the result of two poor customer service experiences, both at the take-out counter.   Take-out is on the sushi side where you can call in or order at the register. While looking at the menu and asking questions about bun/cheese options, the gal at the register's attention was divided between me and a fellow co-worker (it may have been the owner). While she answered my questions, she wasn't particularly pleasant and I left feeling as though asking questions about their menu was bothersome to her.  To the staff:  Take care of one person at a time and don't rush your patrons. If you must be interrupted, be apologetic so your customers know their time and patronage is appreciated and respected. If you can't give customers this attention they deserve, add more personnel. Your food is great, but the customer service could use improvement.

I began seeing Dr. Majidi for desk-job related back pain in October 2013. Over the course of several adjustments, he has helped me understand the cause of my discomfort and how best to mitigate it in the future.  Each adjustment begins with a few minutes on a traction/roller-table. This is my favorite part! The rollers travel the length of your spine using adjustable pressure and reach all the places you can't on your own. Shortly after, Dr. Majidi discusses how I've been doing while feeling around my spine and performs an adjustment accordingly. He also uses deep tissue stimulation for areas of concern. His adjustments are executed with confidence and I feel comfortable with him.   In addition to chiropractic adjustments, he takes an interest in my personal health endeavors by providing advice regarding my training approach, techniques and form. He is very active and nutrition-minded; we often engage in related conversations that are beneficial to my overall health and wellness and I appreciate the time he spends with me to do this.   His office staff is cheerful and accommodating and I am never pressured to make additional appointments that exceed my needs. Because I have hypermobility, I see him every 2-3 weeks and feel fantastic as a result.

A sandwich at Sacks isn't unlike a sandwich you might make at home with fresh and interesting ingredients. The art themed sandwich names lend themselves to the ingredients used and the offerings are in no short supply. In addition to a large and accommodating menu, a whiteboard boasts daily specials:  One cold sandwich, one hot, a salad, and soup. After placing an order at the register, find a table or loiter around the deli counter which displays bottled beverages, side dishes, and desserts. The crew will holler out your name when the grub is ready; occasionally, they'll deliver to your table.  During peak lunch hours, this place gets busy. Even when greeted with a line trickling out the entrance, I've never waited long and always receive a sincere "sorry about the wait, what can I get for ya?" in the event there's even 1 person in line ahead of me. The staff doesn't appear to have a high turnover and is friendly and prepared to offer suggestions or chit-chat.  For me, sandwich assembly is important and Sacks has the ratios down to a science. Be it tomato basil sandwich bread, a baguette, or rye, the balance of meat, veggies, and condiments is always appropriate and well balanced. Edge-to-edge with delicious ingredients.  I generally opt for the Symphony or Ruben, though my lunch partners are never disappointed with their choices.  Of note is their drink selection. In addition to a soda fountain which touts unusual choices such as Sprite Zero and Barq's Red Creme Soda, the tea selection is great. The Market Spice tea is particularly addicting and the Pineapple Jasmine Green tea is tasty, too.  If you're craving something sweet, Wanda's cookies are pretty good. Try the "57," a combination of various cookie doughs that result in an original tasting treat.

On the rare occasion I eat out, I order something I wouldn't normally make for myself at home that also represents the restaurant's culinary expertise. At Over Easy, this usually means french toast, eggs benedict, or pancakes all of which are delicious.   Today, I ordered a simple two-egg breakfast; scrambled with an english muffin, two strips of bacon, and side of pico de gallo. Perhaps I was hungry from the bike ride over, though it was my favorite meal there yet.   The lightly toasted english muffin was served with butter and a well-balanced strawberry jam, the pico de gallo was crisp and refreshing, and the eggs the right fluffy texture.   As a single diner, I prefer not to sit at the bar with my back to the entryway. Sitting at a four-top table seems wasteful, especially when families arrive needing more space. Next time I'll let the wait staff know I'm willing to share.  The wait staff is friendly, prompt, and helpful, offering to warm up coffee often and accommodate diners. The owners are cognizant of the music volume, which I appreciate. I preferred the more quaint stand-alone location off 40th St to the strip mall.

I recently moved to the neighborhood and was psyched to find a yogurt shop nearby. Zoyo is situated in a strip mall with ample parking and plenty of indoor/outdoor seating. The whole storefront opens up using garage-style doors - it's contemporary, open, and welcoming.  Like other yogurt shops I've visited, samples are permitted and the mini cups can be found by the register. Each station dons a plaque identifying the flavor and the caloric value per serving. In my experience, the range is 90 calories to 140 calories (think Green Apple versus Cake Batter). Plenty of choices ranging from sorbets, the requisite tart, chocolates, vanillas, fruit, and the expected funky combinations like root beer, thin mint, and oatmeal cookie.  Of note is the use of cardboard cup dividers. These inserts go into your yogurt cup to separate the bowl in the event you don't want flavors to mix - genius! They really work, too.  The toppings bar is stacked with something for everyone and a variety of drizzles are available too.  Use your phone number to log points with every purchase to earn $ off as you hit certain milestones - no physical loyalty punch card required.  Cons: - Sugar-free options would be nice - The toppings aren't labeled, so ask if you're unsure  Pros: - Great variety of flavors and toppings - Cleanliness - Cup dividers! - The staff. These guys love their jobs and it's evident in the smiles they wear and their attentiveness to help.

Update:  I've found they usually have 1 sugar-free option in addition to plenty of low-fat and non-fat choices. If you're a froyo fan, you'll enjoy it.

I've been a patron of Mood Swings since 2006 when I booked an appointment on a recommendation and Aubriel was my faithful stylist. Over the years, my budget hasn't always been able to support my hair care needs. As a result, I've been disappointed with the cheaper cuts from lower end salons. A few months ago I decided enough was enough and made an appointment, this time with Emily. I was quickly reminded of the reason I loved Mood Swings so much and vowed to never cheat ever again.   Both Aubriel and Emily exemplify what I believe a stylist should be:  knowledgeable, personable, and communicative. Their product knowledge appropriate to my hair type and style as well as their interpretation of what I want has always been spot on. They are receptive to feedback and style with adjustments in mind. Your hair is in the hands of experts with these ladies. I feel great when I leave.  Aveda products smell and feel amazing - if you're a fan, you'll enjoy the complimentary scalp treatment, hand massage, and makeup finishing touch with your haircut.  The aestheticians are located downstairs. During my last visit, Sammy tamed my eyebrows and I was very pleased with the result. I have thick, course eyebrows and she cleaned them up beautifully, making adjustments at my request. The environment was relaxing and the contoured table was heated and very comfortable. The appointment setters are all very friendly, offering a beverage upon arrival and are available to answer questions and make follow-up appointments as needed. I love that they offer an extensive collection of trial-size versions of their more popular products for you to try.  Parking is...well, Mill Ave parking. Be prepared to pay at the meter.

This isn't a review about Cox as a service provider, but rather the customer service I received while in this Cox Residential Digital Solutions Store location.  In preparation for moving into my new home, I called Cox and ordered a TV/Internet/Phone bundle. I later realized the bundle was out of my price range and called back to modify my order to exclude the digital phone service. The order to send out the phone equipment was already processed and I received a package containing the equipment at my residence. A quick phone call to Cox resulted in directions to return the equipment to a store nearby - enter my visit to this location.  From the time I parked to the time I returned to my vehicle, about 3 minutes passed. I was greeted upon entering the store and when I explained the reason for my visit, I was escorted to the cashier's desk where they quickly processed my return of the equipment and provided a receipt. No fuss, in and out. The gentleman seemed happy to help and that made me feel good about doing business with them.

I have been a patient of this office for approximately 8 years and I am consistently impressed with the level of customer satisfaction and professionalism I receive during my annual visit. I see Dr. David Kaplan (not to be confused with the other Dr. Kaplan in the office, his wife) who never skips a beat to answer my questions and is extremely warm and personable. I never feel rushed by him or the office staff and appreciate the measures they take to ensure I am comfortable and that I understand the agenda for my visit, equipment used, and costs involved. Their dedication to improving the quality of lives truly shines through in the care they provide.  The office is equipped with a full service optical store that boasts a hearty selection of frames. The frame stylists (I don't know their actual title) are friendly and knowledgeable in fit, style, inventory, treatments, and insurance coverage. Usually, I seek a unique frame that takes me some time to pick out. The stylists are not impatient and do not pressure you to make a selection, which I greatly appreciate. During my latest visit, I was unable to find a pair of sunglasses that I liked better than my current pair. The gal assisting me brought out a catalog and suggested a beautiful pair of sunglass frames that they did not have in stock, but could order. Unsure about how they might look on me, I inquired as to what happens if I don't like them. She said they would simply become part of their in-store inventory and I could make another selection, no big deal.   This isn't LensCrafters and I won't have my glasses in an hour, but I will happily wait a week because the customer service, expertise, and selection are that great.

I made a last-minute decision to give Wilhelm Automotive a try for an oil change because I feel good about giving business to shops in my neighborhood.   The shop called to let me know the oil change was done and to notify me of their recommendations:  transmission flush, power steering flush, rear brakes, and replacement of both air filters.   The total, minus the breaks, was over $400.   I paid for the oil change and took my car to another shop (brakes, specifically) for a second opinion. Upon leaving, I found my cabin air filter left on the floor of the passenger seat, unchanged and still in the frame. Also, my brakes mysteriously felt gritty.   The second opinion offered a less expensive transmission flush, no recommendation to flush the power steering, air filters changed, and the rear brakes were fine --  5% use in the front and 30% in the back. They cleaned the brakes beautifully and they felt like new when I drove away.   For a $24 oil change, I'd go somewhere else.

Joey and Eric were friendly and very mindful of my time and budget. There was no lollygagging during the move whatsoever. Minus one star because my card was not charged the balance in a timely manner which caused some miscommunication. I wound up bringing cash to their office. I will use and recommend them again for sure.
