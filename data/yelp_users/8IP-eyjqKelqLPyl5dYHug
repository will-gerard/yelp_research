Service was as good as could be expected.  Atmosphere was very nice with elegant lighting and smooth jazz playing or Spanish guitar, thus the Fusion.  Food portions were generous and presented nicely.  Will definitly frequent this place.  Thank you!  Steven

The food I was served was nasty.  I will not go back there.

The food quality, portions and the service was excellent.  They served me ice water and hot tea immediately. The place seemed very clean.

Very busy place, fast friendly service, clean and roomy for a Subway.  I had the meatball foot long and it was great, especially for only $4 on special.

I'll be honest.  I was hesitant to try this place after reading the mixed reviews on Yelp, but the nice girl at Tea Time down the street told me I should try it so I did.  The service has been very good, they take your plastic via Square which I love, and my hot green tea was very good served in a heavy glass tumbler (not the norm for sure).  The wifi connection is good/fast.  The music is a little heavy, but if you want a place to  unwind, you could do that here.  Not an uppity pretentious Scottsdale norm for sure.  I will come back if I have the chance.

I ordered biz cards from here thinking the total was going to be $140.  When I was called to be asked for approval for a $40 art fee, thought I should double check with them again what my total would be.  They told me $240.  I cancelled the order.  I ordered some simple 1/4 page cards to be cut by them for $2.00 cut fee and .25Â¢ per page copy @ 50 copies.  when I went to pick up the order I was expecting to pay about $15 total.  They told me I owed them $40.  I will never set foot in this OfficeMax again.  I thought I would get service like I got in the Minneapolis OfficeMax which was always great.  What rude experience this has been for me in Scottsdale.

Pesto Prima....definitely a diamond in the rough!  Attitude is definitely what makes this place great.  Friendly receptive classy service.  A fantastic hot breakfast sandwich, large hot green tea and relaxing music in a clean non-congested environment.  Even though they have a problem with their free wifi, I think they may be inclined to fix it.  I will tell them about that.
