The place is pretty nice so that's not my beef. The service sucks sucks sucks. Over priced for the wrong service and they will not refund anything. Go elsewhere.

Not really good Italian food but it's a great place to pick up a date if your 80 years old.

Heard about this place actually right down the street from my house. Well I'm upset it took so long to finally go because it was amazing French cuisine at its finest. I hope they do not grow into a large establishment because it is perfecto.

Wow great food!! The soup is absolutely amazing!!!!! Big layout, Clean and friendly. The Boba is the best I've had so far. Pretty good location and easy to find. Can't wait till it's cooler and they open up window Bar.

We were told 30 minutes and guess what we're still freakin waiting an hour and a half later. So the host forgets to activate our pager and gives not one but two parties that came later our table. And she giggles and says oh sorry. Really!!!!
