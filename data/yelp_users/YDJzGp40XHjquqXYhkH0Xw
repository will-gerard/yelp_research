Went there for mini date. Had the sea bass I believe. Boyfriend had the steak Thai noodle. The best dish ever! Even better than mines and it wasn't bad for $15 bucks. But there menu doesn't have much, they couldn't make me a sex on the beach :(

I love Steve Madden shoes. First let me start off by saying every time I go in there. Not a dam sales associate greets or even help out. Like I walk in & 5 dumb snobby chicks thinks its okay to just stare without helping until I leave. Like go work somewhere else. Seriously!  Next time when I go. I'll probably just try a whole bunch of shoes on. Leave it out so they'l) have something to do :) . That's what they get for treating there customers.

Honest review! Went in to get some passion fruit tea with Boba. Took a sip from it. Man oh mannnnnn. That drank taste sooo water down. I'm not playing with yall! Like I have tried passion fruit tea from so many boba shop. But gosh, this was the worst. Sorry not sorry peoples! Like Idk if the employees didn't know how to make it or they were obviously lazy. Especially the guy who made it. The time I order my drank, he looked so bored working. So guessing he was lazy & probably gave me water passion fruit tea. Smh. Plus the boba wasn't even cooked all the way. If your gonna sell boba at snoh. Please know how to make boba & tea because it taste gross. Waste of my $3 something bucks. Just being honest! Dont get butt hurt, just a review. Thanks

Never been here before, so we gave this place a try because it was a walking distant from home. Walked into here and it's a cute little restaurant. It wasn't busy at all, thank goodness! There menu is very simple & easy to read. Decided I might as well try there wings. So got an order of 12 wings. Flavors were Asian zing & lemon pepper. Total came out to $10 something. The man who took our order was nice & welcoming. Gave my son a treat, cool points for you. Anyways when we got home. I decided to eat my wings with rice. My favorite was lemon pepper. OMGAD YUMMMMMMY! Asian zing wasn't bad at all, different style of taste compare to bww. I definitely will go back to try the other food out. Overall, good experience!

Yummms. That's all I can say :) every time im around arrowhead. I stop by to get there house special. Heaven I must say. Its way better than half & half back in San Gabriel. My opinion! Also try there passion fruit tea with boba & fresh fruits. Best boba shop so far in Arizona

We're a regular whenever we're craving for some good food. Especially try there pho & bun no hue. Not expensive at all, reasonable price compare to other Vietnamese shop. Owners are nice, they Dont talk much. But there always asking if we're doing okay or if we need anything. So thumbs up ! Kinda weird location because its around the corner next to Starbucks and a nail salon. Very small shop though. So if your planning on bringing over 10 people & you guys wanna sit together. Might be a problem. They probably have only mmmm 8 tables. So plan ahead I guess. Other than that, go for there soup dishes

Recently got my nails done by Kimmy! Let me say, she's wonderful. I told her I wanted French tip gel. And they turn out beautiful. Perfect shape I ask for :) next time I'm definitely getting a full treatment because she takes her time and its worth my money. Even if I gotta drive about 40mins. Reasonable price, especially in Scottsdale  P.s. the shop is well maintain and it's very open! I believe she remodeled the whole place. Looks great though!

Went back to Jt boba house. Thought I would give them another chance. Omgad! I seriously wanna slam my drink on the counter & say, I WANT MY REFUND. But me, I know better not to do that. Anyways, went there last night and got myself a strawberry & kiwi flavor tea with boba & jam. I thought I would try jam because when I had it in Cali. Omg, I was amazing. Had it here, it was a failure. Everything about my drink was just a no no!!!! Plus I even asked my boyfriend how was his Thai tea. He said " it taste water down" then I asked my little sister in law how was her lychee drink. She said " I hardly can taste anything but water". Fix your drinks because its definitely not good at all. Never coming here unless someone pays for my drink but I probably just get myself a cup of water :)  Sincerely, a customer that knows what's good & whats not good
