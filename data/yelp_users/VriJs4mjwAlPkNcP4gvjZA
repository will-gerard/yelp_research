Reallllllllllly slow service, I think the staff doesn't realize you are supposed wait till after work to smoke the ish.  The food was okay but expensive at least the OJ was awesome.    Good hipster vibe.

This place is close to my house, has a cool venue and was rated pretty well on Yelp.  I REALLY wanted to like this place, I went multiple times to give it extra chances and left each time feeling like a sucker.  Bottom line is the food is bad to mediocre (There enchiladas are so nasty I couldn't finish them), the service is below average and the prices are not

Terrible in every way, worse place I have eaten in recent memory and it is expensive.  This must be a front to launder money because I don't know how else they stay in business.

Excellent wine list and drinks.  Somewhat limited menu but the options they do have are good and the Osso Buco was great

Matt's is good and certainly worth doing at least once.  The food is solid to above average even if it is a little pricey for breakfast but not outrageous.    The real draw is the location which is next to the downtown farmers market.  So on Saturday you can hit the market while waiting for your table, buy something to strengthen your locavore cred and then eat at Matt's which is a hip reclaimed location.    Then off to buy some new Steampunk junk..

Expensive but worth every penny.  If you are looking for a couple of quick rolls and some sashmi before a movie, this isn't the place for you.  Go to Sakana (which is also very good).  You go here for an EXPERIENCE.  Get the Omakasi and plan on eating for 3 hours, being stuffed but still eating because it is otherworldly delicious.  I've gotten the Omakasi 4 times now and every time I have been blown away.

I hit this spot with a few of my buddies after a long hard night and couldn't have been happier.  The vibe was chill but still playful, the service was GREAT and the food delicious.  No douche bags fist pumping, just some chill folks and plenty of cuties to distract you from your hangover.

AVOID THIS PLACE!!  The wings might have been the worse I have ever had.  The wife and I love wings and we could barely choke down 2 each.  French Dip was dry and tasted like eating a block of salt...I'm not even sure how you do that with the 'dip' part but they did.  The beer selection was okay at best...wish 4-Peaks wasn't crowded and I didn't have to look for an alternative.  The only way this place has a rating about 2 stars if if the people that work there or their friends are rating it.

They did a tremendous job fixing my 4Runner at fair price.  I'm generally skeptical of mechanics and am happy to have found one that I can trust.

I REALLY wanted to like this place, it is close to house and I was pulling for it.  I had to convince the wife to not go to Harkins Camelview and to give this a chance.  The theater and the chairs were nice, it is clear they invested a lot of money to try to make it a good experience.  However I was SO pissed over my experience with the food that it took a full hour before I was able to relax.  Wife and I order each order a drink, she got the Freebird and I got the Rooster Cogburn.  Food comes out, turns out the bartender rung in the wrong thing, says don't worry we will get it fixed.  I'm not sweating it at this point, stuff happens.  We eventfully get the right food, mine is bleh her's is okay both of our fries are cold and gross, not even the catchup could save them.  So semi incompetent service, bleh food, we are disappointed but move on.  We are late for the movie so I get the check and pay quickly so we don't miss any of the movie.  While in the theater I review the tab.  The item he rung in incorrectly is $10 on a menu, he rung it in at $15.  My dish is $10 on the menu, rung in at $15.  He charged us for the dish he rung incorrectly, then gave us a credit $3 less than what he had charged.  Normally I would raise this with the manager but at this point I was just done.  Hopefully we will get a well run theater in there someday.
