I was hoping to try the food here before I left the city. Unfortunately, I was turned away at the door, even with empty tables in sight. The hostess informed our party that the restaurant was short staffed and we would have a ten minute wait. No problem. We are patient. With no other patrons waiting to be seated, we requested to sit at a table and would have no concerns about waiting for service while we rested our legs and chatted. We were refused.  In 103 degree heat, we were refused. They were unwilling to allow us to sit inside at an empty table to wait! We questioned this action and the hostess turned to the kitchen, then looked back and said she was not allowed to let us inside.  We were left with the option of standing in the heat while tables remained empty inside, or we could find a place that was willing to accommodate our party. We chose the latter.   I'm sorry that I will never have the opportunity to review the food here. Even more, I am disappointed that the staff behavior was so appalling. The only interaction with the restaurant that I have to review- a refusal to allow us to sit at an empty table.

I hate to say this in a review, but the only thing that comes to mind when I think about this place is, "I've had better."  The dough was not too good, not too bad. The toppings, meh. The sauce was decent. Delivery was not fast, but not excessively slow.  It was definitely an underwhelming experience, but certainly not the worst thing I've ever tasted. I would like to say that the taste and quality do not match the price.  If the management is paying attention, I would like to suggest that you do something amusing and put bible quotes, or something along those lines, on your pizza boxes since you are 'heavenly'. Just a marketing thought.

I always look for a good sushi place during my travels. I found one here in Phoenix at Moto sushi. They have style with a unique flair, classy yet casual, and tasty sushi. I've always received friendly service on my visits and they keep my glass full; these are a must to satisfy me. They have outdoor seating and the patio is dog friendly.  The sushi is good and they have many interesting combinations. Best of all they have spicy sushi rolls. I love the April roll and the Volcano roll.  The decor is modern. They have bar seating where you can watch the rolls made. The music is eclectic and at just the right noise level to clearly hear it, yet not have to scream to talk to the people at the other side of the table.  I've visited Moto on several occasions and will be here several more before I leave.

Great attitudes, plenty of seating, and a talented group of baristas make this store an exemplary example of how a Starbucks should look and run. They listen and make your cup just the way you want it. Some big fluffy chairs, regular tables, outside seating, and stools make a satisfactory seat for every type of butt.   The worst parking lot ever. The drive thru line wraps around the store and they have zero room for you to back out of parking spaces. If the drive thru line is long, you are essentially waiting in the line in order to pull out. The location has parking spots beyond the drive thru, but there are signs saying the spots are for Bethany shoppers only. I do not drink here at peak times because of the parking lot.

Definitely a delicious choice for pizza and wings. I haven't tried their other menu items, but they have great menu options.  The wing sauce is very tasty. I like spicy bbq. The chicken wings are good and juicy. I like the pizza dough and they make it not too thick, not too thin, just right. I hate all pizza crust, but my dog devoured it without a problem. Nice sauce, quality toppings  I find this a great choice for pizza and I hope hope their dishes are as good as the pizza, but I'll have yet to try them before I can review.

I am writing a poor review of Lolo's based primarily on the poor service that I received. I think I would have enjoyed my experience more if I hadn't been treated so poorly.  The place was busy when I came, but there was no wait and I was seated immediately. After being seated, I checked in on Yelp and waited for a server. None came. No one even acknowledged my existence. I looked at my Yelp check in time and 15 minutes had passed. I went to the hostess and asked what I needed to do to get a server. Rather than apologize, she made an excuse and said that the server was busy. I hate when people make excuses. Just apologize and fix the problem please. The hostess got me some tea and then the server came immediately. I ordered fried green tomatoes and chicken. Main course arrived almost immediately. Maybe 5 minutes after I ordered. The tomatoes, no where to be seen. I mentioned the tomatoes to the server and they showed up at my table when I was  halfway finished with the meal. I had planned on desert, I wanted to try the pudding, but the waitress brought me the bill before I was finished with the main course without offering desert. I asked her where I needed to go to order desert. She stared at me blankly and said, "oh, you want desert?" I told her no, it seems that it would be too much of a bother.  I will never return. I think if I had gotten an apology for the service then I would have been a bit appeased. No apology was offered by anyone. Not the hostess, not the server, nor management.  As for the food, I think if I were placed in a blind taste test between Lolo's and KFC, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Maybe it's because the service left such a terrible taste in my mouth, but I will never return to find out.  The only positives to my experience was that I liked the atmosphere and the waitress kept my glass full, which is the only reason I tipped her.  Okay, that's the end of my rant. I hope you all have a better experience than I did.

Unfortunately, I didn't have a good experience with Feeney's. I'll start with the bad and end with the good.  First, the patio is tiny. If I were to sit on the patio, I had to share a table with someone else. Secondly, although the the wait staff were friendly, service was slow. I had a beer before the meal and requested that I get another when the meal came. My second beer came after I was finished eating. The waitress made the excuse that the keg needed changed. I get that, but it doesn't take the entire time of a whole meal to change a tap. The locals sitting near me suggested that I get the prime rib. $20 for the 8oz; based on the price, I was expecting a decent cut, but not exceptional. I was severely let down. I am aware that prime rib is fatty, but this one was more than half fat and gristle. $20 for about 4oz of edible prime.  Now for the good. The waitress was friendly and called me by name. I think it takes an impressive amount of effort to memorize your tables by name. Props to her. The potato skins appetizer was very good and had an adequate amount of sour cream on the side (I love sour cream). The baked potato was made well. The other patrons were obviously regulars and a whole conversation was happening all around me. They jumped right in to introducing themselves and included me in the talk. Finally, the horseradish with the prime rib was very tasty, with just the right spice.  I will not be returning to Feeney's for a meal, but I think it may be a decent place to drink.

I love, love, love the BBQ wings. They always arrive piping hot and the sauce is amazing. They have a wide selection of pizzas. A nice natural crust that is not too thin and crispy, not to thick and doughy. The toppings taste fresh and delicious. The sauce has a very good blend of flavors. I like the American and the Italiano pizzas the best. The calzones are a little greasy, but still tasty.  Delivery times are usually at least 45 to 50 minutes. However, I don't mind to wait for something good.

Phoenix is a very dusty place. It's important to find a a good car wash that is a good value. I had a monthly membership and made good use of it.  The car wash does an excellent job of cleaning. I also appreciate the free dash wipes and air freshener. The vacuums work well. The air hoses are great, too.  One of my favorite experiences is the fast pass lane. I do not have to hassle with paying at each visit; just drive up to the pass detector and the gate opens.  If I return to Phoenix, I will definitely get my car washes here again.

As with most of the places I visit when out of my hometown, I chose R Salon because of the yelp reviews. I am definitely satisfied with my experience.  I had no rapport with any stylist, of course, and signed up for the next available appointment. I have very specific needs for an expert in layering due to hair loss to one side of my head following an accident. It needs to be hidden while it's still growing back. I was serviced by Daniela. She is experienced, friendly, and professional, having all the skills and traits of a desirable stylist. The shampoo, my favorite part of a salon visit, felt wonderful. I enjoyed the cut and the conversation.   The salon is very unique. It has the air of a professional business with a casual attitude. It gave me the feeling of being laid back and relaxed, but also I like I was with competent people who are passionate about their work. No prim and proper here; it's show your own flair and be good at what you do.  I don't expect to be in this city long enough to require another cut, but I would choose this salon again in a heartbeat.

OBH has been my best breakfast experience in the Phoenix area. The staff have been wonderful. The price is right. The food is amazing and reminds me of home. The orange juice is delish. I have never tasted French toast quite like these yummy gems.  The atmosphere is wonderfully casual and unique. The worst thing about this place is the ugly generic chairs. They just do not fit the style and vibe that I get from the rest of the joint. But the chairs are far from anything that could take me away from this tasty experience.  OBH is definitely worth the visit.

The Whining Pig is an amazing little dive wine bar. They have talented and personable staff. The beer and wine list is extensive and changes with availability, providing opportunity to explore new options.  On my first visit here, I walked in and didn't think much of the place on sight. Then I sat down and was blown away by the style, flair, and uniqueness that oozes from The Pig. The nostalgia of the games, the one of a kind decor, the staff personalities, and the eclectic music selection, all make me feel accepted and comfortable.  I also love the patrons. The conversation of my fellow drinkers is interesting and inviting of anyone near to join in the fun. One of my favorite things to do is draw on the chalkboard, be it Pictionary or just doodling.   I recommend The Whining Pig to anyone who wants to kick back, join in on some games, have some great conversations, and drink some beer.

I've enjoyed shopping here for my dog. They are small and quaint, yet have a good selection of various pet products. On every visit I have been greeted by a staff member. The associates are friendly and definitely know their products. They are a bit more expensive than the big chain stores, but they offer the service that you just don't quite get with those big businesses.  I recommend Pet Planet for the dog owner who is looking for a personalized visit and staff trained and ready to answer questions about their products.
