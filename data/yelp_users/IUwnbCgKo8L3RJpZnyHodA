It's hard to say anything really bad about this place, but then again, it's also hard to say anything good about it. I guess if I had to characterize this bar/restaurant I would say that it's mediocre in almost every way. Let me start with the beer selection: not a lot on draft. The fact that a supposedly Irish bar doesn't have staples like Smithwick's or Guinness is disappointing. The food is hit or miss. The vegetable melt was extremely soggy and unappetizing, but the firecracker tacos were acceptable. I wouldn't go here expecting too much. The price isn't bad, but it's more than the food is worth.

Stopped by to fix a star shaped crack in my windshield caused by a rock on the highway. The glass specialist Steven was very attentive, professional and friendly. I waited in comfort inside as he repaired the crack so the glass looks as good as new. I was in and out quickly and the employees were accommodating. I would go out of my way to come back!

Friendly staff that is eager to help with a smile. I'd definitely come back here. I've been to many different ups stores and this one has consistently served me well.

Giving this company five stars is a no-brainer, especially with people like Joe working for them. I had Joe help me when my brand new mustang was nailed by a rock on the 51. He moved mountains to get my windshield replaced in a timely and convenient manner. Not only is he a perfectionist, but he has a great attitude and does the job with a smile. I had also called around to a few other companies in the area, and Real Fast Auto Glass had the best price I could find by far. I hope my new windshield doesn't get cracked again, but if it does, my first call will be to this company!

Love this place. The owners are gracious and very attentive. Terrific margaritas and fish tacos! I'll be a customer as long as I live in AZ. My favorite is the carne asada burrito with their pickled jalepenos and a horchata on the side.

Prob the worst dining experience I've had. Overpriced. Empty (it's obvious why - first RED FLAG). Sub-par food, even worse service. Stopped in because I wasn't in the mood for sushi or pizza, which are the only other options in the plaza. Ate half of my bland sandwich, the chipotle chicken (WHAT CHIPOTLE!?), and left.   I stopped at McDonald's on the way home. And you know what? Even though I regretted that, it was still a huge step up from this dump. Try at your own risk...

This place changes the notion of a "burger joint". I've been to PVBC many times. I try to make it there at least once a week. Their burgers, sweet potato tots, and chicken club on 9 grain keep bringing me back. The food is well presented, well put together, and the flavor combinations are incredible.   Yesterday, however, I decided I was going to try something new and went for the weekly facebook special, the Texas BBQ Burger. Double chargrilled patties marinated in homemade BBQ sauce, roasted poblano, creamy slaw, smoked bacon, and freshly shaven smoked mozzarella. As I took the first bite, it happened: all other experiences I've had with burgers in my life faded to the distant background, and PVBC cemented itself as my definition of the PERFECT burger, flawless in taste, presentation, and overall execution.   And from now on, all burgers I will have anywhere else will only be cheap imitations of the products of divine work being done in this modest, unassuming kitchen. Part of me is just thinking of never eating another burger outside of PVBC.  OH YEAH. IT'S THAT F-ING GOOD. Do yourself a favor. Stop in. Order the brulee, the pulled pork, or my go-to, the chicken club. It wil change you, and then you'll have an idea of what I'm talking about.

First off, to THB's credit I will say that the place was very busy the night I went (3/14/2014) and the ambiance was amazing. I chose this restaurant solely on the great Yelp reviews, so maybe my particular experience was just an unlucky one. That said...I won't be coming back.  The evening started off kind of shaky. Service was very slow to greet, and we felt like we'd been handed off back and forth between waitstaff from the outset of the meal. Waitress was definitely spread thin, and we felt rushed to put in our full order from the get-go. Personally, I like to eat my appetizers before ordering main dishes, but it seemed like this was not an option. So after waiting about 15 mins after getting our drinks, we were finally able to order. The app was great, we had the Baked St. Andre Cheese. AMAZING but we ran out of bread quickly. We ordered more...but it never came...waited for it but the cheese was getting cold, so we just ate the cheese and cancelled our order. Strike ONE.  We soon received our main dishes, the filet and the scallop entrees respectively. Scallops were great, 10/10. The steak, which we ordered medium rare, was uncooked...not undercooked, but practically BLUE in the middle. We sent it back immediately and got some cheese puffs, the night's amuse bouche, to hold us over. When we got the steak back after a good amount of time, it still wasn't cooked properly, but we were tired of waiting at this point and just decided to deal with it. STRIKE TWO.  Finally, dessert comes and it is a birthday dessert, which was a deconstructed goat cheese cake. I know this is an experimental restaurant, but this was a failed experiment for sure. However, since it was a free dish, and of course everyone's taste is different, I wasn't too upset.   What did bother me, though, was when a waitress grabbed our UNFINISHED bottle of wine off the table before we could get a word in, and immediately threw it in the trash. We were definitely planning on finishing it or at least taking the corked bottle home. STRIKE THREE.  There was one more thing that bothered me. When I got the check, I saw that we were charged for the cheese puffs sent out by the kitchen when we sent back our undercooked steak. I brought this to the waitress' attention and she quickly removed it, but not before making a remark about how "the first ones are free but additional ones are extra." When I explained that we didn't order them, she rudely interrupted me to remind me that they were indeed removed from the check so it was a non-issue.  Perhaps a one-off bad experience, but in this case; when it rains, it pours.
