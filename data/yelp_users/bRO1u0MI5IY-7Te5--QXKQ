I love coming here for my pedicures,which I get often.  They are VERY good at the details (which I've had other nail places take little notice of).  It's no spa, but I feel that it is clean and comfortable.  I've been coming for years and have never had a problem.  They are efficient and do a great job!  My nails always last for close to a month, which is amazing with the abuse I put them through on a daily basis!

This is a great little gem in the middle of old town!  I had their fabulous 'monkey cakes'!  These certainly did not disappoint!  The service was top notch!  We were seated immediately and had our drinks within minutes, with our orders taken quickly as well.    I had only previously been here for dinner (which was also great!) but will certainly be back for breakfast!

This is certainly my favorite place in the valley to get good Thai food!  The flavors are fantastic!  I never leave still hungry!

I know better than to not read reviews before I go into a business. However, I came here out of convenience when the normal salon I go to was closed. My pedicure was mediocre at best.  She was not meticulous in getting polish on the entire nail. She also did not clean up the skin where she had gotten polish on it close to the nail. I will definitely not be back. It's a nice facility with clean equipment, but the professionalism is not there for me.

What a great little restaurant!  It is nothing fancy and certainly caters to an eclectic bunch of people, which I think is great!  The service was quick and the food was delicious!  I will certainly be back to eat here!  The store area is quite amazing, too!  When I need spices of ANY kind, this is where I'm going!  The variety is amazing and it is SO CHEAP compared to what you pay in the grocery store!  I'm excited that I found this little place!

Troy does amazing and efficient work!  I have had him do work on a rental property I help manage as well as some work at my business.  Each time, he has been on time, worked quickly and efficiently, and charged a very reasonable and fair price for his work.  I don't worry about the quality, as I know he always does high quality work.  I also have the assurance that if something isn't right, he will make it that way!  If you need a handyman, Troy is a sure bet!  You won't be disappointed in his quality of work and his integrity!

Troy was AWESOME!  He provided  exceptional service at a price that couldn't be beat!  He was professional and got the job done that I needed.  He came when he said he would and was quick to get the repair done.  I HIGHLY recommend using Troy for ANY projects you might have.  He will take great care of you!  I have referred him to other friends and they have also had stellar experiences.

Where do I even start??  I am still in awe that my first time home buying experience was so great!  I have known the Hills for several years and knew that when the time was right, I would use them to find a home.  Steven James became my agent within hours of contacting Doug and Kirsten.  Steven was fantastic to work with and was always available to answer questions and guide me through the process.  He was very professional and ethical in the home buying process.  I never questioned the integrity of the information he offered, or the actions that were taken.  I felt completely confident in his expertise of the market and in the decisions he helped me make.  The turn around from offer to close happened very quickly and he helped manage the chaos of it all - which really wasn't chaos at all!  The Hill Group is truly a team of outstanding real estate professionals.  While Steven was the key player, I had several members of the team assisting in the process.  I could not have asked for a better experience and would not only use them the next time, but also refer them to anyone who is looking to buy a home.  You just can not go wrong with their level of detail and professionalism.  THANK YOU is just never enough for how appreciative I am of them helping me find and buy my first home!  "Professional Service with a Personal Touch"  They nailed it!

Rob did an amazing job with my carpets - the best job that has ever been done on them by far!  He was thorough and took time to make sure everything was clean.  I was going to try to replace my carpets because they looked pretty beat up.  After Rob cleaned them, they looked like brand new!  No need to replace the carpet just yet!  The other great thing about using Rob was that the carpet was left feeling soft and new, not crusty and worn like other companies have left them in the past.    I HIGHLY recommend Rob to come clean your carpets - or anything else you need cleaned in your house!  He did an amazing job and I will definitely be using him again!  Thanks, Rob!

Caite is an awesome therapist!  She listens to your needs and then addresses them.  She is very good at what she does and is very professional with how she delivers both herself and her massages.  I always feel amazing when I'm done with a session.  As a massage therapist myself, I'm pretty particular with who I receive massage from.  Caite is my go-to-gal.  Give her a try - you won't be disappointed!

I won't be back any time soon. The service terribly slow, the order was not delivered correctly, and the lack of customer service overall was mediocre at best. I'm not sure what the deal was, however, there are much better options in the are that have much better service and food.
