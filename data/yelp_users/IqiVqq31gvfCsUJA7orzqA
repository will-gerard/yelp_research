The only reason I didn't rate it five stars was because of the screwed up delivery. The food is delicious and they took care of me for messing up our order.   #7 (the best of everything) is about the best sandwich ever.

We have loved La Pi√±ata since the 80s when we moved to Phoenix.  The chips and salsa are fresh, the margaritas are tangy, and the green corn tamales are the best ever.  I usually get the Aunt Carlotta's green tamale special, as I did tonight.  I'll be miserable before I'm done but I can't quit eating it!  So good!

We stop here a couple of times a month. We didn't have any of the service slowness problems a few have mentioned, and the food is spicy, hot, and good.  I do miss the salsa bar and yummy flour chips, but get here during happy hour and get them for $2.

I wish there were less stars I could give.  The person took my order but not my last name or telephone number.  I stood in front of my office for 35 minutes so I wouldn't miss the delivery.  Came back inside my office and called jimmy johns. Oh, sorry, they said, we didn't know how to get in touch with you and we don't deliver to your address.  This is less than one mile away.  Jimmy John's sucks.

We tried the place for the first time yesterday.  We were seated promptly and got drinks right away. We used the form to order some 1/2 pound burgers and sides. We all asked for our burgers to be cooked "Medium".  The burgers arrived not an unreasonable amount of time later but they were WELL DONE. All three of them.  The server apologized and took two of the three of them back to the kitchen.  That's really where the break down occurred.  After a 15 minute wait, we called the server over and he said "there are orders ahead of yours". You might imagine how we felt when we heard that.  A while later, the manager came over to apologize.  When she brought our food she comped our entire meal for the issues we experienced.  When the Medium (more like medium rare but who is sending them back at this point?) burgers arrived, they were delicious and juicy.    I hate that we waited so long for a burger, but I was happy that the manager took care of us expeditiously and without hesitation.  We will come back another day and try again.
