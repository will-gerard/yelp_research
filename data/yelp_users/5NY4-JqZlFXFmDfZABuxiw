Make sure you get the fresh wasabi - you're welcome!  I've only been there on Sundays, and for good reason - all day happy hour!!! Buy a sake bomb, get a super cheap appetizer - and make it the crispy calamari!!!!  It's the hands down best sashimi I have had in the valley - and at a great price too!  The cucumber may be the best roll I have ever had, but it comes at a price.   As for the staff - expect friendly and fun but not superior service. Good, not great.   Unless you sit at the sushi bar - the chefs are a lot of fun to hang with.

If you only knew the story behind this place. I have seen the kitchen and the food handling antics. My goodness gracious people. Beware. I can't count on my fingers and toes how many police involved stories I know about concerning the owners harassing patrons and the treatment of the employees. Look for a pathetic looking blonde-haired witch drunk at the bar, and know that she is in charge of the operation.  By the way, please tip your bartender/server as they are illegally not getting paid to work. Ownership decided to cut wages of the employees and make them work for tips only. In these tough times, people nee dto make ends meet, and unfortunately they are taken advantage of by owners like these.

Incredible wings that are always at a decent price, but even better on Saturdays when they are 35 cents each! You have to order in 10, 15, 25, 50 and 100 pcs.  This place is very dive-y, but not overly localized meaning its a good crowd if you are doing with dive bars. The bartenders are down to earth, real people, and its a great place to just kick it. BTW, they have free wifi, so you can be sure to catch me there sipping a 20oz brewski slapping away at my computer.

I am giving this 5 stars based on Happy Hour alone. Apparently, they pioneered the concept of the reverse happy hour, so kudos to them. That's not why I am writing. Get there for the happy hour and you couldn't be happier. $2.50 well drinks poured with some oomph, and killer appetizers deals. Get the mussels! Yes, sometimes they are better than others, but always good. I recommend also the escargot and the shrimp bread. wowza!

The 4 stars is for Friday night happy hour only!! It runs from 4-8pm and they have an outstanding complimentary buffet! The drink specials are decent. You can get a double well drink for the price of a single, and they pour nicely.  Back to the buffet - I'm pretty sure it is only on Fri, but the buffet has tacos, nachos, fruit, veggies, and a beef brisket.

Stave and Kelly are the jam! We did our classes and pool sessions back in October, but because of some scheduling conflicts, we weren't able to meet again for our lake dives until April. Our fault completely, but they went above and beyond to work with our difficult arses to find a date to get us into that lake and certified. And by golly, we did it!  Obviously, I have never been certified for scuba before, so I can only go off this 1 experience. What I can say is that the attention to detail, and the extremely personable experience was more than I could have asked for. Steve and Kelly take their time to get to know their students, and make sure any and all questions/concerns are clearly explained.   I thought I was going to black out on the CESA, and my gf was terrified at the idea of taking her mask off 20ft underwater. We talked with Stave and Kelly before we did anything, and they mentally walked us through it, and prepared us. When you are doing your skills, they are within arms length and watching - making sure you are OK.  I would recommend Phoenix Scuba to anybody looking to not only get certified in Scuba, but to do it with some great people. I am looking forward to my future in diving, and am sure that I will be heading out with Steve and Kelly!

We are surrounded by people that have been waiting along with us for over 20 min for their order. No joke at least 8 groups. We ordered 2 tacos. 35 min.   Restaurants get a rush. It happens. But we should've been informed when we placed our order so we could've had the option of going elsewhere.

4 stars for Thursday wing special. Honestly, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that these may be the best wings I have ever had. And guess what, they are only $5 all day every thursday!! Now let me explain my perfect wing: I like them smaller, well done and not overly covered in sauce. Spot on here

I'll keep it short - go to V95, drink good wine & order the Salmon! Hands down the best salmon dish I've ever taken down - and I do mean taken down - it didn't stand a chance! I reluctantly offered others at the table to try in hopes they would say no before I inhaled this dish!  Great atmosphere - Had a band, I believe it was Vinyl Station ( 2 acoustic guys, 1 w/ a gnar gnar beard) - incredibly talented - and most importantly, they had the sound and volume dialed in. It was ambient instead of overpowering.  I recommend the Rock shrimp & ceviche app, Salmon, poblano entree, carrot cake and the smore's brownie. You're welcome!

Bartenders = just annoying as can be - the type of people who you intentionally avoid eye contact with in hopes they don't speak to you - kind of like you would with a crackhead that is on a muttering, ranting binge attacking anyone who comes too close to them.  Boynerds on a self-manifested coolguy pedestal  dancing to their own tune (read: Rebecca Black's "Friday"). If you do sit at the bar, please make sur eto take note of the tool pool (read servers) that feed off every move the tenders make - like groupies at a One Direction concert. Except it's all guys. all guys.  Wings = Quite good actually, though the menu says they were supposed to come with celery, which for some unknown reason really upset my girlfriend when the celery didn't show up.   PB & J Burger = 2 words (food poisoning) - yep, thank you Rehab for allowing me to enjoy my first bought of this wonderful gem. The idea is controversial, but from the common opinion from staff and patrons alike, we went for it. Maybe they are good when cooked properly - but that's not what I got. I got a hot pile of slop in the shape of a burger. All I could taste was mushy,warm peanut butter and the juices of meat that I suppose was the burger. My gf and I split 1 burger. I ate 3/4 of my half, she ate 2 bites. I already had a lump in my stomach. We paid and got to safety.
