Awesome chicken salad. Wish they took credit cards though!

Decided to grab a bite to eat after going out one night. We seated ourselves at a booth, and a group of people that were waiting for their bill told us to not sit in the section because it was bad service. We made the wrong decision and ignored the group and sat down. After waiting about 5 minutes,  our waitress came to the table to get our drink order. After another 5 minutes, our drinks finally arrived and she took our order. 10 minutes went by, and our waitress came back and told us she had lost our order and wanted to know what we wanted again! She never apologized, and acted like it wasn't a big deal. Our food finally arrived after an other 10 minutes. Our waitress never came back to check up on us, and never re-filled our drinks. I had to stop another waiter to get us water. Once it was time to get our bill, we went to the cashier area and asked a different waitress if we could have our bill because our waitress went missing. We wanted to split the bill on two cards, and she said she couldn't do that.

Love all their bagels and fresh veggie cream cheese. Everything I have ever tried has been good. Owners are always working and are very friendly.

Been looking for a good mexican restaurant since I moved to Arizona. Came here for lunch, and it wasn't busy at all for being noon. Got complimentary chips and salsa. The waiter helped us with ordering and even brought out some of the sauces for us to try. He recommended the enchiladas, so I order the chicken ones with green sauce. I was overall very impressed with them and so were my friends.

Great happy hour pricing and food.  Make sure your entire party is present or they won't seat you.

After waiting for over 15 minutes for my appointment today I went to the front desk to make sure I was checked in. The girl at the desk seemed confused and said she would go back and check to see if my therapist was there. After waiting almost 10 minutes the front desk girl came back to inform me my therapist called in sick and the manager didn't take her off the schedule. You would think if you were a business based off appointments you would obviously call clients to reschedule or immediately figure out a solution so you could still service customers. The solution they gave me was to come back two hours later....like I have nothing else to do today because they lack communication and customer service.

The manager contacted me a few days later regarding my experience. He understood my frustration and apologized numerous times.

Slowest Starbucks ever. I have been here numerous times, and it never gets any faster.

Went in for an oil change, and left with a brand new jeep! This was my second purchase from the Airpark location and I have had excellent service both times. I have worked with both the sales manager Nathan, and the sales person Shawn. They were great help finding the right jeep for me at the right price, and have since followed up with me since my purchase.

Cute clothes, but never get any customer service while I'm shopping. Fitting rooms are never monitored, so girls take in 15 items at a time, then continue to switch out for other items. No one seems to care that customers wait 20-30 minutes for a fitting room.

Jamie and Vanessa did an awesome job! They showed up right at my 8am appointment time and made the house spotless. They even cleaned the inside of the microwave and oven!

Went in for a eyebrow wax. Was great that I could just walk in, but the lady who did it was in a hurry. Although I was in and out of there in 5 minutes, she put some sort of oil on my eyebrows that got into my eye and all over my hair. Once I got home I noticed a few hairs she missed that I had to pluck myself.

Amazing food and awesome decor. I usually never venture out and try different things for breakfast, but their menu has so many interesting items on it. The eggs benedict with the crab cake is so delicious! The patio is dog friendly, and they have free wi-fi.

Have been looking for a new salon for over a year now and got referred here. I had stylist Shannon who I was thoroughly impressed with. She took her time asking questions about what I wanted, and you could tell was very detailed while coloring and cutting my hair. I was really happy with my results! I even got 25% off my first visit, and they gave me a book with coupons in it for future visits. I also received 20% off the products I purchased as well. Definitely will be back to see Shannon!

Place is overly crowded every time I come on the weekends. People are constantly pushing and the bouncers don't seem to care. I have had my credit card stolen from the bar and my phone stolen out of my purse.

Decided to try this place today and won't be back. Poor guy behind the counter had to handle the register and prepare the food, while another guy counted the tip jar on the side instead of helping get the line down. I was the third person in line and waited over 15 minutes to get a bagel. The guy ahead of me order a burrito and it took them over 5 minutes to cook the eggs, then the burrito ended up on fire. The man asked for his money back and left upset. They didn't have lids out that fit their cups, and the veggie cream cheese only had green onions in it. Not impressed.

Went on a Sunday with friends, waited forever to get our order taken at our table so we got up and ordered from the bar. They ran out of fireball throughout the day, and the bathroom had lights that were out making it extremely difficult to see, and there was no hand soap. After we told an employee about the bathroom, they informed the manager who didn't seem to care.

Brisket and beans are the best! Had them cater for a wedding rehearsal dinner and they helped us plan how much food we should order. Staff was very friendly and helpful!  Everyone at the party said it was some of the best bbq they had ever had!

Went there on Sunday and it was pretty dead. The waitresses were too busy talking so the service was pretty bad. The mimosas were mostly orange juice with a ton of pulp, barely any champagne in them. Tacos were pretty good but al a carte. Miss the old menu they used to have at the other location.

Good sushi at a good price. The stuffed jalape√±o appetizer and the crunchy bay roll were awesome! We called and made a reservation which was probably good since the restaurant is a little smaller.

Went in for dinner without a reservation because it states on yelp they don't take reservations. The rude hostess informed us they didn't have any tables available but there were so many empty ones. We asked why we couldn't  sit at the empty ones and she said they were reserved??

The new management and staff is amazing! Have been there twice in over the last month, and have left extremely happy both times. One of the best manicures and pedicures I have ever had!
