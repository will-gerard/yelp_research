What a great spot.  Just moved downtown a month ago and have been exploring new places to eat.  Just finished a brunch at Coronado cafe...  I had the southwestern omelette, and my fianc√© had the crab cakes.  First of all the $3 bloody Mary's and mimosas are a steal, but that became an after note to the food!  The crab cakes are out of this world, huge chunks of meat and before I could ask for a second bite it was gone.  Luckily I had my own omelette that did not disappoint.  Cheesy, hatch chilies and really tasty potatoes on the side.  The service was good, and the owner was available and really matches the curbside appeal.  Great ambiance in a cool historic house.  Definitely worth trying.

I have been to this course a few different times.  The summer deals brought me in because it is a little pricey during the season.    The greens and fairways have always been in good condition and I enjoy the challenging hills and strategically placed bunkers.  I haven't really scored well on this course but as a beginner golfer I enjoy the challenge this course offers.   Water jugs on every tee is crucial for the summer months.

I have been to Cibo a few times now and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good date spot, and ambiance.  It is located in downtown phoenix and the restaurant is a beautiful old house with a great patio.  My girlfriend and I got lucky and enjoyed live entertainment.  The food is amazing.  I had the pizza and the burrata mozzarella.  Both were perfect.  The mozzarella was so soft and came with prosciutto and bread and was drizzled with balsamic vinegar.    I love the crust on the pizza... completely crucial.    Check it out.

Bloom has an amazing happy hour.  They offer half off wine and a great menu that is more than generous.  The food is fresh and service is good.    My favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich.  its all about the pretzel bread.  I also recommend the wine flights.  Not too many places offer this and it gives you a chance to try a few varietals you may have missed before.    Good for family and business.

I just tried to get a sandwich at capriottis on Bethany home.  Went out of my way to get there at 7:40 on Thursday night.  The doors were locked and the employee inside saw me and barely acknowledge me being there.  Google said open until 8:00pm and the writing on the window said open until 9:00pm.  I should have known something was up when I tried calling at 7:15 to place an order for pickup and no one answered.    If they had to close early for a reason I would understand, but to have the doors locked and see people inside deliberately ignoring me was really frustrating after a long day.  If there was a reason you had to close, just come to the door and let me know.    The sandwiches are fine and I would change my rating, but I just want management to notice this situation, and I feel this may be the best way.   Right now I'm reluctant to come back.
