Well, here it is...my first review.   The Good: Incredibly friendly staff. Everyone from the hostess to the bartender were great! Wish they hired people like them everywhere.  The Bad: The reason that I know they are all so nice was that it took at least 45 minutes to be seated. Allowing enough time to meet everyone who has even thought about applying there.   The Good: The food was good as well as being fairly healthy.  The Bad: No matter how many ways it can be prepared, Kale(sp?) is never going to be a part of my diet.   Overall, If you don't mind waiting for trendy Cafeteria's with better food then your old high school, this is the place for you!! Very much the place to be right now. I'm happy I went and it wasn't bad for one dinner but won't be going back anytime soon.   I am however, officially convinced that the restaurant is better then this review....

Just a great local venue.  Can't say enough postive things about them.  It's a win for everyone considering all the food, staff and owners are local and many have apparently been ties into the music scene.  The music is great every night but you should be prepared to pay a cover if you go after a certain time.   Plus, I'm no foodie but I haven't had a bad meal yet!
