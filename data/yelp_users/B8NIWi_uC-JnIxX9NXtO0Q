The BEST Mediterranean food i've had in the west valley. I'm a huge critic when it comes to food like this, but this place blew my mind.

This place has some of the best service i've seen. They made my pizza wrong, and before it came out they let me know what was going on and bought me a drink for waiting ~5 minutes after my friends got their food. The pizza was okay, nothing too crazy, but not awful.

This place is great. There's no water and ice that you can go to where you feel like home, as much as this place. The owner is very welcoming and humble from the moment you walk in. I always get my water here, because it tastes the best by far. Highly recommend!  (and yes, the ice cream is wonderful as well)

The absolute best burger i've had. Hands down. The chicken sandwich is great too! Don't skip out on this place if you're in the mood for a burger.  Also, like people said--- they only take cash. Be careful!

I have always been a fan of TGI Fridays, but this location is ruining that for me. For some reason the food here is just not the same as other Friday's locations. Be cautious.

I'd give the food a 3/5 and the actual restaurant a 5/5. The food was really just okay, but this place looks GREAT!

A great place to take your family! I've been here many times and every single time I leave like I did the time prior, satisfied. Great tasting food, service is excellent, and the park is beautiful.

Delicious! You pay for quality, and that's what you get here. I got the Dylan without bacon, and the chef himself Dylan made it for me. It tasted great, this place is awesome!

I usually enjoy chili's. But this restaurant in particular really irks me in regards to my experience. I came here with a buddy of mine and we ordered the queso to start, which was extremely cold. I didn't say anything because it was manageable. I ordered my burger without bacon(due to religious reasons) and it came with bacon. I told the server and she apologized and brought it to the kitchen and told me they'd make me another one, I marked my burger before doing so to assure that'd be the case. And lone behold, the burger came back, except it wasn't a new one. I told the server that it was the same burger, and she was shocked. She brought it back to the kitchen and brought me a new one that was scalding hot. Lone behold it was the same burger that had bacon on it just flipped over to the other side as if I wouldn't notice. Shameful.

I've been here twice and the first time was a 4/5, it was wonderful. But the second time was embarrassing. I came here for my birthday and invited my family here for dinner. Half of our entree's were cold and my fathers entree had THREE bugs in it. The owner really didn't act surprised, and took my fathers entree away and my dad asked for it to be taken off the bill(needless to say, he was disgusted to have anything else from this place.)  The ambiance of this place is what really lets it get past 1 star.

This place has been my doctors office for 16 years now, and the staff that was there then-- still remembers me. Everyone here is so nice and professional. As for the doctor, I completely recommend Dr. Timothy P. Baker. Dr. Baker is a very caring doctor, and will really do what he can to asses your situation.

Came back here for Eid with my family, and being such a normal customer I was expecting the food to be as stellar as usual. Unfortunately it wasn't that, at all. The kibbeh was cold inside(as if it was frozen then nuked in the microwave). The beef shawarma was burnt, the fatooush didnt have any salt in it. The chicken shawarma was stale, and the garlic dip had no hint of garlic in it. Truly depressing, and I looked like a fool talking so highly about this place. To let them serve us all of this "food" was unfortunate,  it makes lebanese cuisine look bad.

Love this place. DEFINITELY get the D-box upgrade for action movies. Worth it! It is pricier than some of the theaters, but why not. You get to reserve your seats, you can get a cup of coffee and a legit meal. Also the employee's are nice people!

This is a hole in the wall place, but it's surprising how amazing it is. It tastes like a home-made sandwich, and the flavors they have are nothing i'd ever seen before. You'll never have anything like it again.

Solid burger, kind of pricey though. The fries were super okay though.

WOOOW.  That's the only word I can use to describe this place! Truly a family owned establishment with employee's that actually care. The single slice of pizza is 3.00, and was more than enough to fill me up. It tastes extremely delicious as well!  All in all, THE BEST pizza i've had in AZ so far, and the price makes it even better!

One of my favorite places in Downtown Phoenix. They have such a unique variety food, and it all blends together extremely well. Expect a wait on the weekend, but for good reason. Worth trying!

I've been living in Prado for a while, and this is the best living you could have in the West Valley. From the moment I stepped into the main office for a walk-through till now, I have never regretted choosing San Prado over San Lagos. Mark Taylor in general is a wonderful company, but the management and maintenance people are what set them apart from the other Mark Taylor apartments. I study at Midwestern, so having a quiet place to study at home is extremely vital for the time I spend here.

Prefer this place over the usual Chipotle. Taste's relatively the same as Chipotle, but a bit tastier. And the tortilla that they use is wonderful. However, I strongly urge you to put the queso in the burrito. That's the game changer.

This place is pretty good! I'm not quiet sure why it has gotten bad reviews--- I went into this place expecting it to be horrible, but it was pretty dang good. I got the burger which was a little small, but cooked to perfection and delicious. I subbed out the fries for mac and cheese for no extra charge(which is nice). The mac and cheese was amazing as well! The service was impeccable, and you can tell they really have cared about their reviews. Happy hour specials are wonderful too, half off appetizers from 3-7, can't go wrong there!

Food was phenomenal, and the staff is some of the best i've ever come across. Our server was one AMAZING. He brought an extra dish free of charge just for us to try since we had never been there. Absolutely coming back

Meh. I should have known better.  While walking around Santan Mall area I looked for a place to eat, and being in the mood for Chinese I thought i'd give this place a try. I ordered my food (the cashier was on HER phone and told me to wait for her to finish the call---it's okay, i'll wait). I sat down and waited for my food to come, it took a while, but it came. I picked it up, and asked the guy behind the counter for a fortune cookie for the end of my meal and he pulled one out of his pocket to give me...Weird. Nonetheless, I sat down and began my meal. It was awful, the chicken the bland, the chow mein was raw, and to top it all off-- I found a hair in it. Blekh. I got up and was about to say something till I noticed one of the chefs who kept wiping his brow, basically over the food. It was gross, and I knew it wasn't worth trying to talk my meal over with. Hey at least the bathroom was clean.

The best arabic food i've had in AZ. It's authentic arabic too, which is extremely rare to come by nowadays. The garlic sauce taste just like my mothers,  which is the best compliment I could ever give. Can't wait to go back.

Probably wouldn't come back. A burger itself was 8$, fries were 3$, and a shake was 5$. Such a huge price for something completely okay, with a small portion. Service was awful, burgers came out to us 1 at a time for me and my buddies, so by the time we were ready to eat the person who got their food first was out of luck.

This place is REALLY unique. I've never seen anything like it. The place itself looks small from the outside, but it's got quite the dining area. My buddies and I each enjoyed our sandwiches, and the server in the front was extremely polite and patient with us since we had never gone. Would absolutely come again!

This place is really great! The honey-bbq is some of the best I've ever had, and the buffalo was delicious. The staff is super friendly and accommodating as well! I do agree with some posters in regards to the ranch being 'dilly', it's a weird taste, but they haven't been open for even a month yet, there's tons of room for improvement on that end. All in all, wings are amazing.

Seriously everything I've had is so good, and the portion sizes are so generous! The owner and the workers in the back are all very nice and very accommodating. Worth trying for sure! (Also the ranch is fantastic)

It's sad to review this place and give it 2 stars knowing that it really has potential to be 4+. The inside of this place is beautiful, very clean, and very open. I ordered a burger here which was okay(nothing amazing), the fries were extremely greasy---but then again it's a sports bar, so no complaints there. However, being charged 8.50 for a side greek salad was kind of out of the ordinary. This place is very pricey for a sports bar, I know it's a nice area... But sheesh, the costs for medium quality food isn't something I like to attend often. What really hurt is the service. My server came by our table a total of two times for the TWO hours I was there. My party ordered two burgers and a flatbread pizza which took an hour just to get there. Who knew being the only group in the restaurant would make the chefs go extra slow. Kind of frustrating. Nonetheless, this place has potential, they just have to step up their game. I probably won't come here again for quite a while.
