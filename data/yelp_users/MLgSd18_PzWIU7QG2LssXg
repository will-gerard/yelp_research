LOVE LOVE LOVE Grazie - very cool pizza and wine bar in Old Town.  The pizza is fresh and delicious.  Their Italian wines are interesting and reasonably priced.  Their nutella dessert calzone is to die for.

If you like pizza with a TON of sugar in it, this is your place.  My husband and I found the pizza to be inedible.  When we complained, the woman behind the bar said that she's give us 10% off the next time we came in.  No thanks.  Worst pizza I've ever had.  If you really like pizza, try Oregano's, Grimaldi's or Pizzeria Bianco.
