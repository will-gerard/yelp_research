Nothing was 'wrong' with this place, the atmosphere was ok but I've just had a lot of amazing sushi before & this place didn't do it for me. I had 5 different rolls & really did not like any of them. Everything was very fresh just plain.

PATRON FUSION!!!! Wow. Love it!!! This place has really figured out how to make a margarita. It is the ONLY place that I enjoy drinking a margarita. Their food is very good & I have always had great service. Keep up the good work! One of my favorite places.

I got sick from this place today. The burger was good but the 'chips' that came on the side were odd tasting. Nothing exciting.

Can I give them a negative 4? Worst staff. Worst food. Worst management. Horrible all around. I have never in my life been treated the way I was treated tonight. I am embarrassed for "Copper Blues". Wow. I will never go there again. Ever. Wow.

I've tried to go to this place a couple times before actually getting to eat there since there is always a huge line. I'm happy I finally got to try it today! My business partner & I ate a TON for about $25. Try the WHITE TUNA! It is phenomenal!!! I also love the fact I can eat within 1 min of sitting down (if the line isn't long).

Highly disappointed with this place. I just attempted to eat here. Hostess sat us. 30 min later still no drink order. Still nothing. Just had to finally get up and leave. That is sad because we were repeat customers. Sorry Salty Sow.... Won't be visiting you ever again.

MANAGEMENT: you will go out of business if you don't change it up. Service is horrible. Food is good. First off, like most of the reviews on here I found to have the same experience. I want this place to do well because it is so close to my house. The first time I went there I sat at the bar. I received amazing service & the food was great. It was late & they were not busy. No complaints. The 2nd time I go, a totally different experience. I WAITED 45 MIN till a waiter came up to us. The only reason they finally served us is because we went inside & told them. After I finally get service & order my drink the waiter comes back about 10 min later saying that they didn't have what I wanted.  I was not the only table on the patio, I saw 4 other tables trying to track down their server as well. When we finally got our food the manager brought it out, drug his feet (literally) to the table. Not professional & trashy how he presented himself. I had to ASK for a discount because it took OVER AN HOUR to eat; and even then they were reluctant to give it to me.   I want this place to do well but there are too many places with great service that deserve my money.

This place has amazing prices and is huge. If you live close to it, it's better than buying off Amazon because their prices are so competitive. It's like a Walmart but not as many people & much shorter lines. I recommend it for rugs & home decor.

Courtney is amazing. She is always able to squeeze me into her busy schedule. My business partner and I had Courtney do our hair for our professional photos and she did a fabulous job. Her prices are unbeatable and she's such a great person. I would highly recommend her... I am the type of person that always changes my hair stylist every year but I've been working with Courtney for over a year now & have no plans on leaving her!
