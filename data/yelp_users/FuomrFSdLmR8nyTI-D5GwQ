This place is horrible for so many reasons! Let's start with the bugs, smell, safety and staff! The bugs are ridiculous! I wake to them almost every morning. The smell is old and musty and despite my attempts, it doesn't go away. Some of the neighbors are great, some are just straight out stalker crazy and the staff took no ownership in my and/or the safety of my children. And to make matters worse, the staff and clearly for the benefit of the owners, are money hungry munchers! They nickel and dime you for everything, from parking spaces, to move in/out costs, etc. The washers and dryers are disgusting and of much need of renevation. It's located in a great part of town and Arcadia, is definately my favorite place to live and you expect the modernized, 50 style building, but this place is a joke! Save your money and buy in the neighborhood! This place is no where to live!

Zipp's Arcadia was one of my favorite local "go to" sports bars in the neighborhood. Anyone that knows Arcadia, knows, there are some other pretty cool spots, but I always appreciate the personable service I get from the bartenders and barmaids. Anna and Rachel are a couple of my favorites! They are both great at what they do and make it cool and fun. Frankly, they rock!   The food is pretty good, but the level of service is what had me coming back. You also get to know a few of the neighborhood regulars and feel like a neighborhood family, hanging out to watch a good game. Thank you to those that have made it enjoyable, up until today!! I appreciate you! Cheers to you!   My complaint is with the Manger, Kevin! The bar was empty, which I could see is his biggest concern. The place was not packed by any means and no one was standing up waiting to get a seat. There were empty tables behind me. I came in crutches today to watch the SEA vs ARI game and he insisted, that I remove my post surgery boot, off the chair next to me, so that the seat would be available to someone else. There was no one else. I attempted to tell him, if the seat was needed, I would gladly put my foot down, if someone needed to sit down. Regardless, of logic and good manners, he insisted I put my foot down. So, I gracefully put it down, watched a great win and paid my bill. I doubled my tip, just so that I wouldn't take away from the level of service and commitment that Anna offers. I wanted to make that clear, despite his lack of leadership and consideration.   However, I will not be going back, ever! (YES, I WILL BE PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN, Kevin!) I hv lived in the Arcadia neighborhood for years and appreciate a good local bar, but Kevin made Zipp's the opposite of what I thought Arcadia was known for and took pride in.   Kevin, find another job! You are not good at what you do and after sharing my disappointment with other patrons and staff, I am not alone in my opinion. For all those that can't or don't say it - You suck at your job! My suggestion is to go back to school and learn some management skills or supersize my fries.

Fabulous spot. The goat cheese appetizer and coconut calamari is amazing! The Calamari is the best, fresh tasting and cool presentation, I've seen in the valley.   Highly recommended. Garrett made it even better. Personable, knowledge and fun. Thank you!

What a cute, quaint, lil' place! Love Sydney's! The tequila grabbed my attention, but the empanadas kept me hanging out. Locally owned and operated. Come see, Lee!

Absolutely love the ambience and the decor. The service was good too! I had the shrimp ceviche. I was looking for a light appetizer with a great glass of wine. It was a toss up between the ceviche, calamari or the tuna tar tar. The waiter suggested the ceviche. I thought it was ok. Not at all what you would expect for ceviche, in the southwest. Ill be back, but not for the ceviche. The ceviche at LGO, is much more my style and a modern, less traditional style of ceviche. My friend had the chicken wings. Not good. Boring, frankly! But, my favorite are oysters and the lobster roll. I'm willing to go back to support a local new seafood restaurant in Arcadia. Welcome to the neighborhood.

This is an amazing taco spot! Tried a few that were all great, but a definite favorite were the Shrimp Tinga! It is shrimp, bacon and chorizo. Yummy! The different tastes are pretty incredible.   Also, tried the smoked brisket, carne asada, beer battered cod and mahi mahi. All wonderful. I also tried the signature margarita. Good stuff.   The service and ambience is cool, clean and inviting too! I was taken great care of by Sean and Lenny! Thank you!   I'll be back!! Cheers!
