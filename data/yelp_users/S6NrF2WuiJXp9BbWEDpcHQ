Yelp, get with it, please....Checker on 7th St is now O'Reilly & that's who I'm trying to write a review for.....thanks! :)  In any case, I came in to the 7th St location today as my battery was sputtering & on its last breath and that's where I'd bought it previously. Sue was the employee helping me & was patient enough to look under several different phone numbers to see if my battery was still under warranty. It wasn't (groan in my head, money signs in front of my eyes) but she did me a solid & applied it to my case so that instead of paying $100 for the new battery, I was only out $60.   Beyond her willingness to help me, she was friendly & quick. I definitely recommend this location to anyone looking for help who's car savvy and maybe not so car savvy (me).

Okay...so I kind of cheat. I write about places I've already been to but I'm new to Yelp and trust me, I have a new destination planned out verrrrry shortly.   What can't I say about The Dillo? I've heard about this place for years and have only within the last year or so been in to take it for a test run to see how great (or bad) it could be. It's lived up to the hype.  The Armadillo Grill is misleading. From the outside, it isn't what you would expect. It's a sports bar with class and the food is awesome. My favorite? The fried pickles...such a guilty pleasure but I eat them with ease. The wings are also fantastic and so's the calamari.  The wait-staff are all friendly...every single person I've been served by has been attentive, friendly without being over bearing and sometimes, a big ol' smart ass (specifically Jason the bartender) which is right up my alley.   Any place that has reverse happy hour is a winner in my book seeing as I work late most of the time and rarely get to make that 4-7 slot many places have. And the happy hour is fantastic!   Even when I move closer to downtown, I'll still make my trip up to stop in at The Dillo....you should too!

I'm cheating on Robeks....and it sucks but I have to give props where they're due and the four stars is mainly for the friendly staff that this location has. The abundance of hello's and how are you's is sometimes a little much but they always have smiles and it shows in their ginormous tip jar.  The smoothies are good. As fresh tasting as Robeks? No. But since the location closed down (which makes me sad as me thinks the chain isn't doing as well as I would think it would be) this is the next best thing and it ain't that bad! I'll check back in once I've had more of their other options like the fruit only smoothies as well as the veggie/fruit smoothies.

Don't let the name of this place fool you. They may be a cheaper grooming but they're certainly not better. We've taken our cat here a few times because of their reasonable pricing but I'd honestly rather pay more for better results.  The last time we took her to this place, they cut her whiskers. Pretty sure that's not how this is supposed to work but we made the mistake of giving it one more shot. We received a call at 4:30 p.m. today after having dropped her off at 11:30 to be told that "not even four people could hold her down" long enough to get her properly groomed. That's odd; not only is our cat super mellow but she doesn't have claws in her front paws (not our doing. We adopted her like that). The only good thing about this visit is we weren't charged for the hack job they did.   Please keep this in mind before you go here.

I've been to Chelsea's in the past so this really isn't my first time here nor was it my only great experience but that was my pre-Yelping days so here it goes.  I took my mother here today for a second Mother's Day outing and arrived a little after opening which was good as the place was packed by noon. The hostess was friendly and sat us at a booth. I love the interior of this place; lots of brick, stone, wood and high ceilings not to mention a beautiful bar overlooking the patio which I will definitely be returning to check out more closely.   Started out by ordering the Prickly Pear Margarita...so yummy and it's a pretty drink (hot pink). Perfect for the hot weather. We split the Del Mar Salad...amazing! The shrimp and crab tasted fresh and there were generous portions of both along with jicama, avocado, and tomatoes. Afterwards, we split the French Dip with fries. The meat was so tender and delicious! Next time, I'll probably add cheese as I felt it was only missing a slight something. The fries were yummy and they tasted like they were seasoned with something sweet...unexpected but good none the less.  Our server was Cara and she was great.She was very friendly without seeming fake and over the top.   My only problem is how to avoid going to Chelsea's Kitchen all the time as I've moved in right near by. I guess I'll need to remind myself that while it isn't unreasonably priced, it's not the cheapest either. Who knows if that will even stop me?

The tricky thing about living in my neighborhood is that there are so many quality places (quality in my mind and according to Yelp pretty quality as well) that it's easy to get stuck going to the same places when I go out.  Rosie's is pretty much right down the street from me but Monday was the first time I'd gone in for forever.   Me and a girlfriend of mine sat up at the bar as the place was in that in between time where it was just after lunch but not quite happy hour aka dead.  I ordered a black velvet with the bald bartender whose name I didn't get but who was very friendly. Unlike some of the cocktails I've ordered, it's beer and cider so it's straight forward and was delicious on that warm day.  I love all the wood and interesting details put into this place; definitely doesn't feel like it's a bar that belongs on a busy street like Camelback.   I ordered the Pastrami Reuben that they'd just added to the menu and wasn't disappointed in the slightest.  The grease eased a hang over from the night before and the meat was prepared just right.  They went easy on the 1000 Island but the pretzel bun that it came on was delicious! The fries were cooked just right.   I will definitely make it a point to return sooner as the weather is perfect right now & I love me a good Irish bar!

I'm switching it up. I'm going for retail vs happy hour and yummy food.   While I normally work every weekend night to pay those bills, I decided to take tonight off to go see a comedy show downtown. I loveee getting dressed up and putting on heels so I had to buy a new outfit, naturally.  It was 10 am...I was feeling a little lazy so I went somewhere close as apposed to Fashion Square where parking's usually a bitch. I'm glad I did.  Wendell who works in shoes was awesome. He was patient and attentive which was great considering the sales going on there right now and the amount of women who were in the shoe department (women are crazy sometimes with their shoes!)  I'm not sure who the other employees were that helped me but they were fantastic as well. They made what sometimes can be a living hell a laid-back experience.  Now I've had a great day so far and have an even better outfit for tonight!

I don't know how it is that I've lived in this area for as long as I have and haven't been to Dick's until last Sunday but I'm glad I finally made that choice.  My friend & I went to have brunch as amazingly enough, there was no wait. I guess we were the lucky two that day for it was 11:00 am. Tiny bar area but I was a fan...it was cozy. We started with the Bloody Marys which were really yummy. We split the breakfast burrito with chorizo, potatoes, and beans...delicious! Perfect amount to be split.  Our server was friendly and attentive and service was quick.   All in all, a solid experience!

Maybe I'm a little partial because I helped open the coffee/gelato area way back when but after a few years hiatus, I'm glad to say Olive & Ivy is still spot on, if not, better.   My family & I came here for my birthday dinner & the hostesses were friendly and had no problem seating my mother & I even though the rest of the party wasn't with us (I know that some places are really finicky about that so it was nice to just be seated with no hassle).   Our waitress was great from the get go. Her name was Andrea I believe? She was very friendly without being too over the top & paid attention to details even going so far as to offer to have my niece & nephew's spoon & fork that they have with them whenever they go out rinsed off in the back (I know of places far less nice than Olive & Ivy who wouldn't even do that so it was major points).  We started off with the hummus with veggies that had a kick to it...pretty damn good. The bread with pesto is ah-mazing!! I probably (definitely) should have refrained from having as much as I did as I was stuffed by the time my meal arrived. After the hummus, I had the half portion of the beet salad with goat cheese and pistachios...pretty solid trio of ingredients on top of the arugula and it was yummy!  Following that, I ordered the flatbread; half Margherita half prosciutto/egg/potato and while I wasn't sure how that latter half would taste, it was good. I'm a sucker for prosciutto and theirs is no joke! I couldn't finish it (surprise surprise) but I still ordered desert...it's my birthday, what better day to treat yourself?! The ice cream bar that's been previously mentioned is SO good...coffee ice cream with marshmellow and a chocolate coating with some peanut butter thrown in for good measure.   I have to say, as well, that the cappuccino was amazing   Well done, O & I. I will definitely return sooner for happy hour!

I love going to new places and am surprised that I've never been to or heard of Corbin's but after my visit on Monday night, I'll be sure to go back.  Me and some family members went on Monday night for happy hour. The place was dead but I loved the interior; small but with a cute set up with fun art work. We sat in one of the booths and the waitress was super patient with getting us set up in the right table given that two of my family members have to have a certain seating arrangement due to a bad hip and bad knee.   I ordered a dirty martini that was made well and it's always a plus when places serve their martinis with bleu cheese olives. My favorite!  We started off with the onion rings or "O Rings" which I had heard were some of the best and they didn't disappoint. They're not too breaded or greasy and the chipotle ranch had just enough of a kick. I had the ahi-tuna appetizer which was delicious! It was served on these kind of crackers I guess you could say with a wasabi mayo. Just enough for me as I wasn't super hungry.  The service was good especially has one of my family members is particularly opinionated and difficult at times. Our waitress handled her with patience which was appreciated.  All in all a great first time...definitely going to have to check brunch out!

Alas...I've given up the idea of writing a review for a place if it isn't at least 4 stars. Sue me; I'm in the industry.   Fuego Bistro is by far one of the best places I've been to recently. I was introduced to it this last weekend on a date. Ironically, it's super close to my house yet I've never heard of it. When we were arriving, I was a little curious to see where the hell he was taking me since there aren't any signs really and it's pretty hidden. Once we were inside, though, it was like finding a little treasure.  The patio is welcoming & even though we didn't have a reservation (aka we couldn't sit outside) we snagged a table close enough to enjoy the beautiful weather.   We started off with a round of mojitos and even though it's been a few years since they've won best mojito...I can say the Prickly Pear was the best I've had in a while. The Ahi Tostadas followed & they were awesome...the sauce added a kick to it & it was a perfect start to the meal.  After, we shared the Fuego Pasta with chorizo, chicken, mushrooms, peppers, & a chipotle cream sauce...huge! What I did eat of it was delicious. My favorite (and my date's I'm fairly certain) was the special...an herb crusted Mahi Mahi with a pineapple sauce, home-made cornbread, & chipotle cheddar mashed potatoes. Amazing. Even though the Mahi Mahi might be hard to come by if you visit, the two sides aren't & are so good, I'm droolin' just thinking about it. :)  Dessert? Try the banana burrito. Heaven on the tongue!  Kevin was an excellent server which just highlights the night. It's hard to have a great meal without great service but he provided just that.  If you're in the area...check it out. If you aren't...check it out. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.

How I do love me some good sushi and Blue Wasabi delivers.   I have to admit it's a bit of a hidden gem that includes a casual yet upscale environment with a super trendy touch screen menu listing their drinks and signature rolls that are humorously named. My date & I tried the Killer Bee, Me Soy Horny and Chuck Norris...all yummy but the Chuck Norris was my fav hands down..I'll resist the urge to insert a round house kick joke here.   Our waiter was attentive and friendly...all in all a great first experience.   Not the cheapest sushi joint I've been to but given it's near the Scottsdale Quarter, I'm not too surprised. I'll definitely make it a point to return!

This is technically my second time coming to St. Francis but the first time I only had drinks so I thought I'd wait until I got the full experience like I did on Tuesday.  I love the layout & the overall feel of the place. There was a lot of natural light and the music was awesome.  St. Francis has an awesome drink menu...I had the Pineapple Rum Mojito (amaze balls and pretty self-explanatory) and the Peartini ( Grey Goose Pear, St. Germain & lime I believe; kick in the mouth but definitely not a bad thing! Better to be strong than weak.).   My girlfriend & I had the baked goat cheese which was yummy...different but a good start to lunch. The Turkey & Avocado sandwich was what I had for lunch based on the server's recommendation and while the sandwich itself was tasty, the fries were mostly soggy...not crisp at all really. I'm a pretty big fan of fries and the few I did manage to eat were good but unfortunately, most of them weren't...which is basically my only "meh" moment during lunch.  Our service was ok; not the best...not the worst.  I'll definitely be back for dinner to check out the ambiance and try a few different things! Overall success.

I know, I know...it's Filiberto's but when it takes 30+minutes to get drive thru, it's ridiculous. My mistake assuming that it wouldn't take long given every other location has been speedy. Not only did it take forever but they screwed up my order which o didn't let them fix given the wait time.  I'll never stop by this location ever again.

I feel as though anything I say about Postino will just sound like regurgitated compliments that a lot of other people have tossed out there...but I'm gonna say them anyway!  Love the place. The wine selection is fantastic, the servers are friendly, and the bartenders are laid-back but still get the job done quite nicely. I never feel out of place if I've had a rough day and just want a glass of wine or a mixed greens salad and sit solo at the bar.   You can't really go wrong ordering the bruschetta. it's definitely my favorite menu item; particularly the brie/fig/apple and the smoked salmon. Still have yet to try a lot of the other items because I'm pretty boring and stick to the same things when I'm there usually but being that Postino's maybe 3 minutes from my house, I don't think working that in will be a problem.  If you haven't been, GO! I'm pretty positive you won't be disappointed.

Three years later and I'm still a regular. Can't imagine why. :)  I have to admit I stick to the day time outings here even though the Monday/Tuesday $20 bruschetta & wine can't be beat.   I felt the need to update this as there's been a little bit of turnover since I last posted but the great thing is, service hasn't depreciated whatsoever. Bryan, Lindsay and Topher are my favorites as they're always attentive and nice without being aggressive or fake.   Touche, Postino, for keeping your service and overall experience quality.

I love this place! Vintage meets modern-ish and has a baby and it's this place.  The service is always good. Ronnie was my server tonight and he was attentive and cute without being overbearing while Juan Carlos was our server a week ago and he was very attentive and conversational.  The drinks are fabulous. They do not skimp on the booze and are reasonably priced while being tasty.   Love the decor...very Tiki and open concept with the patio being the best with the numerous tables and fire-pit.  I'm cheating in that I've only tried a few things and am still giving this place 5 stars! The sweet potato fries are amazing...probably the best I've had. You can't really screw up bacon and an English muffin and hash browns can you??   I'll be back but I'm sure my review won't change.

What's not to love about this charming house turned eatery?  The patio is awesome and usually full but even if that's the case and you're stuck sitting inside, it's inviting and cozy especially at night with the lights turned down and the candles lit.   Mac & Cheese...my arch nemesis and one food that's been my fav from when I was 5. TMI nails it. So yummy and with the cracker/bread on top of it, adds a nice texture and taste. The BLT with avocado is delicious..so simple but the ingredients are fresh and you can't go wrong with chips and a pickle slice.  TMI's beer list is solid and I've yet to try the wine but when it's basically down the street, I don't have to think of too many excuses to get back for the service and the atmosphere.   By far one of my favorite places!

The staff was really friendly at the Phoenix location! It was really busy as it was right as they opened but they handled it really quickly & efficiently. The prices are really reasonable so if you're looking to get pet neutered/spayed or shots, I'd recommend Altered Tails!

Ohhh RnR....Working in the industry, I know what it's like to be a new bar/restaurant so I'm pretty understanding about certain mishaps but after the service last night, I can't say I'm going to be coming back or recommending you to any of my friends at any point in the near future.   Me and a friend were occupying one of the bigger booths located on the right as soon as you walk into the place. We weren't really eating and we didn't plan on staying that long and the waitress was nice enough at first. As the place got busier though, she rarely checked up on us and for the last 45 minutes we were there, didn't ask my friend if she wanted another drink. I understand what it's like to be busy (I get my ass kicked at work on a number of occasions) but the power of a smile goes a long way and this girl didn't really seem to give two shits.   After drinking some of the beverage I had in front of me, I realized that there was a HUGE crack in the glass...not baby sized...huge. When she came around I lifted the glass, half apologetically smiling  because I hate complaining (especially when it's busy) to which she responded with "What?" After she saw it, she said "Oh shit" and brought me back a different drink. That's all okay but when the bill finally came she hadn't bothered to void it off and a simple "I'm sorry" would have sufficed.  It's the little things like that that can bring people back to RnR for a second shot. Maybe in a few months I'll give it another go to see if the service has improved.

So....I caved and I've been back to RnR and this time around, it was a LOT better.   The bartenders are nice, the service I've had has definitely exceeded my last experience....the only thing I haven't really tried is the menu. Even though I see RnR as more of a way to start the night with a few drinks vs a sit down dinner...guess I'll just have to give it a try!

Oh Richardson's...you never cease to impress  me. I was there tonight for my mother's birthday with my brother, sister in law, niece & nephew & surprisingly enough, it was pretty dead. This was the first time I've been to the new location (hadn't been to the previous location in at least a year) and even though some lady came in & said "OH it's so different but so similar"..(doesn't make a whole lot of sense)...it looks pretty much identical to the previous location...cozy seating & all..pretty sure there's extra seating on the side as well.   The hostess was nice & sat us as soon as our full party was there. We started off with the chips & guac which was pretty fantastic (spicy as well but I love a good kick to my food) & the pinot noir which is fabulous...best pinot I've had in a while.   We then proceed to split the blackened salmon with pineapple salsa (my mother & I) with the mixed veggies & potato stuffed green chile & two side salads....two side salads were definitely not required...they're huge as are the portions typically served at Richardson's. It was delicious.  I'm not sure where previous Yelpers have noted they only have one dessert as we had not only the flan but the sopapillas as well which were prepared perfectly...not too doughy, not too tough. Absolutely great end to the meal.   Overall, great experience. The server was extremely patient with us as we requested things frequently & was laid back while being attentive at the same time.   If ya haven't been, go. It's a great atmosphere for a date & I can't wait to go back once the weather's cooled off to enjoy the patio.

I came in for lunch and sat at the bar as it was fairly empty. I've been here before but failed to write anything for whatever reason.   I really like how open the feeling is when you're at the bar. That's probably because the sliding window is still up since the weather is nice.   The turkey burger I had was delicious with lettuce and cheese (I added jalapeños for a kick) and mayo. For my side, I ordered the half & half fries...yummy!  I like that their ranch isn't a traditional ranch. Drink wise the Hop Shoch IPA had a kick while the pomegranate mule was refreshing & light.   Even better was the service. Alex was my bartender & he kicked ass. He was friendly without being fake & handled business well as it got significantly busier throughout my meal.   Sam Fox, I've said it before and I'll say it again; I doubt you could develop a restaurant I don't like.

I'm caught in the middle....I've been going to the Vintage Vig for a little bit now so when they opened up the Vig Uptown...I'm not gonna lie, it took me a few months before I checked it out......but I'm glad I did.  While I love the "old" Vig for it's awesome patio ( usually...not during the summer, of course) and great service, I love the new Vig for its decor, great drink specials, stellar service....and it's a little more geographically desirable.   The Arizona Room did trip me out at first because I assumed sitting up at the bar that it was a patio but it's actually nice being able to feel like you're SORT of outside without really being outside. The wall to leave your mark on is fun! It's an interesting little addition and it's entertaining to see what some people put up.   The guac and chips are good as are the sliders aka The Trifecta...can't go wrong with the shoe string fries. Once again, I'm going to have to head over there on an empty stomach to really test it out one of these days.  I can agree with most on the valet; the guys are really nice but there's tons of other spots to park at if you aren't super lazy and wanna cross the street (or head next door).  All in all, give the Vig a go.

Love Brick's decor...they used the space well and the patio is perfect for people watching especially since it's so nice outside (finally!).  I went in before work because one of my friends works there & I thought I'd give it a shot so I'm not reviewing places I've been hundreds of times and absolutely love.  The bartender was really friendly and attentive so from the get go, I was doing well. I ordered the focaccia with a side salad and the Brie soup. It was pretty good except the soup was cold. Not sure if that's how it's SUPPOSED to come but a little heads up woulda been nice.   Other than that, I'll definitely be back....especially for the happy hour. :)

Owners of Drift and Stingray, I give you props once again for opening up another fabulous place in Old Town.  I went a few weeks ago on a date night with my roomie and was beyond excited...I love going to new places for the food, drinks & chance to Yelp. Hah :)  It took a little longer than necessary for our server to greet us considering the place wasn't very busy but once she did, she was attentive and nice.   The cocktails have hilarious names like the Woo Tang and the Woo Jito and aren't lacking in flavor or booze. I had the WooJito and it was yummy!   We started off with the lettuce wraps which my roommate had heard were amazing and they didn't disappoint. The lettuce was fresh, the sauce was spicy and the chicken was fantastic. I stayed boring with the Cashew Chicken but it was so flavorful and the chicken was so tender that I didn't regret it.   Can't wait to head back soon!

The vibe of Garage is awesome...high ceilings, exposed brick, dark furniture, and an awesome fireplace. I went there last weekend for a little Sunday Funday mimosa action and wasn't disappointed. The crowd was minimal and our server was attentive. I went New Year's Eve with some friends for a few before our next destination and Casey was awesome! Made the best dirty martini and was super friendly.   Garage, I'm determined to give you 5 starts but alas, I can only give you 4 based on the fact that I haven't tried your food yet! Don't you worry, though, I'll be back soon enough.

Alas Sam Fox has opened a business downtown & I wasn't disappointed at all.   The patio's great but it's starting to get warm (imagine that) so me & my friend grabbed a seat inside near the bar. Love the exposed ceilings & overall feel of the lounge area.   Had the Raspberry Mojito (not the best I've had but still pretty good) to start off with....switched to the Sun Up beer...awesome suggestion from our server.   The apple & beet salad was yummy! A great sized portion & really flavorful.   Service was great...our waiter was really friendly & super attentive.   Can't wait to get back for happy hour!

Why I haven't written a review for Windsor earlier I'm not sure as I've been going there since it first opened but it's a good one so I guess better late than never!  The owners of Postino just can't go wrong I'm convinced. I'm a long time fan of both locations and was super excited when they opened up Windsor as they have a full bar and different, numerous options for food.   Let's start with the interior, love it. Modern with some natural elements; very laid back with an awesome patio that I've actually yet to sit on as I'm usually at the bar or one of the comfy booths as soon as you walk in.  The staff is always on point and friendly without being too in your face which I really love being that I am a server and I don't really need the follow up every 4 minutes. I most recently sat at the bar solo on Wednesday or Thursday and I didn't get the bartender's name but he was really nice without being overbearing.   Food wise? Omnomnom is all I have to say. No, the Backyard burger is awesome. I've only gotten it Classic style but it's delicious! The meat is flavorful and the portion is generous to say the least. I'm also a big fan of their fondue and the Brown Bag (??) Chicken sandwich. Everything tastes fresh and you can't go wrong with Churn next door for the dessert...best Butter Pecan I've ever had.  This area has some solid restaurants and Windsor is no different. Definitely a great spot for lunch during the day or a date at night. Check it out!

Three of my friends and I went in to Barrio Queen as an in between before our next destination one night. The place was pretty slow and it was a perfect night so we sat on the patio. Our server came to greet us pretty quickly but I take it that might have to do with the fact that we were one of three tables outside. In any case, he was very attentive throughout the hour or so we were there.  We ordered four drinks that were a little pricy but worth every cent. They were amazing! This was a few weeks ago so I can't quite remember exactly the names but they were delicious. Fresh ingredients and a good amount of booze.   The server made the guacamole table side and it was awesome. Figs, fresh avocado, apricot, chives, tomato among other ingredients made an awesome end result.   I give it a 4 star review because even though we didn't have a full meal, given what we did have when we were there, everything was great. I'll definitely have to give it another go around for dinner just to solidify the rating as I have a tendency to be very forgiving. :)

Came in today to grab a quick bite with my mom. We sat at the bar and were greeted by Andrea who was a great bartender! She provided some recommendations and was friendly. I went with the Mint Strawberry salad...SO good! The salad is huge and they don't skimp on any of the ingredients whether it's the mint, strawberries, gorgonzola or almonds. My mom had the Southwestern Chopped; it was good but I'd suggest adding chicken to it for more flavor.  The overall atmosphere was good; it wasn't crowded, had a nice breeze from the patio and it was clean.   I'm giving the Midtown Daily Dose 4 stars only because I haven't tried enough of the food to really push that 5 star button.

I knew it was going to be bad when I heard they were putting a Nordstrom Rack literally right down the street from me but I had no idea it was going to be this bad for me & my bank account...  First off, the place is immaculate..so well organized and it's beyond easy to find what you're looking for. Not only that but even the clearance racks are still organized where as most places, most people have picked over it in such a frenzy, it's usually impossible to keep it tidy..but NR does it!  Secondly, the staff is awesome. So friendly without being in your face and when my mom had a tumble, they called me to the front, walked me over to her & really took the time to make sure she was OK. I can't tell you how much it helped that they were so nice as she was really embarrassed by the ordeal. The entire staff is friendly too..not just one or two people...specifically Stephanie, the girl who checked me out. She was so nice & really took the time to help me.   The clothes are obviously great. Great selection and for great prices for the most part.   Damn you, NR for exceeding my expectations..you're going to make it impossible for me to not come in more than probably necessary.

Upward Projects...I challenge you to open a place that I don't like. Actually, don't. Pretty sure it's impossible anyway.   I went to Federal Pizza for lunch with my mom today and let me tell you...I was not disappointed in any sense of the word. The vibe is laid back, the layout is open, and the decor is natural and minimalistic while being stylish at the same time. We struggled between sitting at the bar or at a table as we're used to doing bar at Postino and table at Windsor but the booth won.   Our server, Jared, gave us enough time to actually look at the drink menu without leaving us wondering if we had a server which was nice. Settled on the Sean Minor pinot noir which I kind of cheated on because I've had it and it's yummy. Light with just enough flavor.  We decided to get the margherita pizza with prosciutto and arugula on half as well as the spaghetti and meatballs and a side salad for me. The pizza was absolutely delicious...the prosciutto added just enough salt to balance out the arugula covered with lemon dressing and the crust was awesome; not too tough and not too doughy. The spaghetti and meatballs were tasty and the meatballs had a good kick to them. Side salad was pretty basic; mixed greens, beets, and a vinaigrette dressing that was really good.   Service was attentive without being overbearing (I'm a server and I appreciate check ups but not every 5 minutes. I promise I'm a little more laid back than that!). I only wish I had tried the dessert as they all sounded fantastic but this is definitely not the last time I'll be going to Federal so I'm sure I'll make room for it on the next trip.

Love the location of this place! I went to happy hour yesterday with some friends before going to watch Jaws during the movie in the park which I've somehow managed to avoid going to for some odd reason even though the Biltmore Fashion Park is literally down the street (Pretty sure I've mentioned this before!).   The ambiance is nice and the staff was really friendly; I was greeted by at least two hostesses, a manager and some wait staff as soon as I had entered the building.  We sat at the outside portion of the bar and I was super happy about that as the weather was amazing and it wasn't too crowded which was nice. The bartender was nice and attentive (I should probably get names more often so that I can give them the proper kudos).   I was pretty much only drinking but did manage to try the calamari and the crunchy crab sushi off of the happy hour and both were delicious! The calamari was prepared perfectly and wasn't rubbery; it also came with a spicy dipping sauce..so yummy! And the crunchy crab? So damn good and tightly packed which is something that can be difficult for some sushi places to manage...I kept raving and I'm pretty sure I had more than my half of the portion.  Alas, as are most of my reasons for only giving 4 stars, I have to wait until I actually have dinner at Ling and Louie's but yesterday was definitely a good start in that 5 star direction.

For decor alone, Culinary Dropout gets 5 stars. Lots of natural elements with sparkly chandeliers and a huge patio space with all of the aforementioned games. I really love that they paid homage to the auto-body or motorcycle shop that it was formerly on the sign out on the street. The open concept is fabulous.  Me and a girlfriend of mine came here for lunch last week and got there early as I've heard from friends who work there and other people who have visited that there can be quite a wait both at lunch and at dinner which I totally understand as it's a new spot in a great location. I'm glad we did as there was little to no people there so we were able to get a seat quickly.   We started out with the pretzel and provolone fondue...YUMMY! I totally indulged my inner fatty but we split it so I didn't feel quite as guilty.  I ordered one of my favorite drinks to try at different places just to see how each place mixes it up (literally), the Moscow Mule. It was pretty good...not the best I've had but it was good. After pigging out on pretzels, we both ordered the Spring Salad which we were told had just been added to the menu and that was the first time they were being debuted; It consisted mainly of asparagus, beets, green beans, greens and a vinaigrette. The salad was tasty and light..perfect for the warm weather.   While we should have stopped there, we decided to get the salted caramel corn that came in a glass with caramel pudding I believe on the bottom layer. So good! My sweet tooth was satisfied.  I will say, it's a pretty pricey lunch at $75 but I'm definitely gonna come back on a Sunday Funday biking kind of day to check out the bar and the patio.

This place is truly not worth the money they're gonna try to charge you. The front office is a joke. When I called them to ask them a simple question in terms of the estimated time of completion for work being done, the lady had no idea work was even being done and told me they'd call me back. They didn't. When I called them back, I was told "it's to improve everything for everyone" and that I'd be "receiving something nice"...interesting as I'm not renewing my lease that's up in June & it didn't answer my question. They won't mind spending money on fixing the parking lot but when the AC was out for 2+ months (one of those including several days of higher than average temps) getting temporary reprieve was an issue & people received window units 3-4 days before everything was fixed after being told that the higher ups didn't want to shell out for them and that's why they weren't received earlier. The complex has been under at least 2 different management companies in under a year so that should probably tell you something. I appreciate the work the maintenence guys do overall so that & the fact that the location is pretty good are what the one star is for. Save yourself the hassle.
