Great Chinese food for a great price. Didn't give five stars only because it isn't the best Chinese food I've ever had. I always order takeout as it is super fast. Never have had to wait longer than 30 min.

This place has really great food. The Brul√© burger was fantastic. Would have been five stars but the actual restaurant is falling a part a little but not enough to warrant any concern. I'll go back 100%

Food isn't that good and service was horrible. Very slow, server forgot to put in my entire order with the other orders at my table.

Surprised how amazing this place is considering it is located next to a Panda Express. Best pork I've ever had.

This was my second visit and it was just as amazing as the first. I was about 20 minutes early for my reservation and they were able to seat me right away. The menu changed from my last visit (maybe due to change in season) but the beef medallions were absolutely fantastic. I know it's next to a Panda Express but don't let that fool you, it is a really nice restaurant.

MiOh Salon is fantastic! Not only is the salon in a great location it looks amazing. Great environment.   Make sure you ask for Megan. She is by far the best hair stylist I have ever had. My hair had never looked this good.   Guys, trust me. Never go to a barber shop again. Your hair will never look better. Plus she is a cool person to just talk to. Couldn't recommend her enough.  Update 3/15/16: Two and a half years later and Megan is still doing an amazing job. Always happy with my hair when I leave. Wish I could give more than 5 stars! She is that good!!

This experience has been so amazing! The staff is extremely professional but also very kind and welcoming. My initial consultation went very smoothly. All my options were presented in a way that I could understand and there was zero pressure! All questions were answered without making me feel ignorant. The way they speak about the product shows how much they believe in it. Although I had an (extremely extremely rare, like 1 in 3000, non-serious) side effect, the staff did everything to accommodate me. The Man Cave is really awesome and having the choice of wine or beer during my treatments was cool.  In terms of pain/discomfort: The first 15 minutes were really uncomfortable for me, but once the nerves go numb the procedure is painless; until the session is over and they have to massage the area for a few minutes. Not gonna lie, it was really painful but I am a really rare exception because I have Hypersensitive-nerve syndrome which causes the nerve endings to "go haywire" after some sort of trauma (in this case getting frozen). It effects 1 in 3,000 (at least that is what my doctor told me). About 6 days after my procedure, when the nerve endings started to wake back up, my pain was incredible. Not only was my skin hyper sensitive (couldn't even have a shirt on without pain), I had these intense stabbing pains. I literally could not sleep for three days. Again, this was due to my hypersensitivity syndrome. Luckily I was able to get medication for this exact issue and within a few days the pain was gone! Plus Bodify paid for my doctor's visit, without me even having to ask them to.  I am in month three of four but my results haven't been as promised. I was worried that I may have to pay for another round of Cool Sculpting to get me where I wanted to be. I was shocked when I was told that if I am still not showing the promised results in another month that I would be re-treated, 100% free!! I did't even need to ask! I was told that if I was re-treated I would be, out of over 7,000 treatments, only the 4th person to be re-treated. This shows how much they believe in this system. I have never heard of this kind of promise before in this industry.  So despite the bad pain that I experienced after the procedure and the fact that I may need to be re-treated, I am still giving a 5 star rating because my experience was that amazing.  Key factors for 5 star rating: 1. Staff is professional, warm and welcoming 2. The staff truly believe in Cool Sculpting 3. The Beautiful Results Promise is real 4. The accommodations that were made before, during and after my treatment were beyond anything I could have hoped for.
