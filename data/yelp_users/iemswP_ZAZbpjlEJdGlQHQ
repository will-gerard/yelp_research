I used to like this doctor, but now I don't.  The PA who used to examine my moles on an annual basis left, and the new one seems overwhelmed.  After waiting for months for an appointment, I waited 55 minutes in the outer office to have a 5 minute examination. Wonder how much they charged my insurance for that?

This man knows his stuff. He is a good family doctor. He does his continuing education and research and knows the newest things, despite the fact that he is a family doctor with a very busy practice.  And he doesn't complain about the American medical system, because he used to practice in Toronto and sees both sides. He's smart and he cares, although he has a somewhat gruff exterior sometimes.  I'd give him a 5, except he runs  late all the time because he has so many patients.  On the good side, he has open wireless in his office for the convenience of waiting patients who need to work while waiting.

To me, Houston's on Camelback is Cheers. Been eating at the bar with Tom and Al for 20 years and they're always fun to see.

This is a doctor who really cares and tells the truth. He does not try to sell you anything; he simply gives you the alternatives and if you ask his opinion, recommends conservative treatment. He also has an efficient, friendly staff  You can't ask for more than that.

Everything in here is homemade, and the restaurant is family owned. It's a gem, and is hope it gets the following it deserves. I had the Verdura, which is a vegan option, and a bruschetta that was to die for. The chef makes her own pasta fresh every day and her own Titamissu.. In a neighborhood full of chains, this is a welcome addition and I want it to do well!
