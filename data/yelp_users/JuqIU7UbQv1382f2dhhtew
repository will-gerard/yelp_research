Love this place, iv lived behind the sub factory for the past 4 years and more recently started going.. And now it's a 1-2 visits a week. Hot Pastrami! Roast beef melt.. Both amazing (something about the lightly toasted bread) and the hot italian. Please for your sake try this place and enjoy.

I have had cox for about 6 years and always paid my bill, yet every month I have more fees and owe more money, every time I think my account is back to 0 they inform me about another charge, but let's get to the phone service, 1-10 people that answer the phone are helpful and precise. It took 4 phone calls 30-45 min each to have them change my address for my new place. This MONOPOLY is unjust.

I ride the orbit everyday. I wish to some higher power that I didn't because there now have been many times that I'm calling my employer that I will be late because each driver leaves at their own time and that's when they choose not when your trip planner says or when the route is supposed to leave. When this happens I sure hope your not the one trying to catch another bus because you will miss it and hey there won't be another for 20-30 min.. Depending once again on your driver... And don't waste your time calling and making a complaint NOTHING WILL CHANGE!

I love this place. Iv been eating the food here for the last 5 years it's been open and it hands down beats the local Mideast food. Yeah the service when you sit down in lack luster.. It's bad let's just a say it. But the food is very authentic and the owner very personable. I'd suggest calling in an order and bringing it home. But at least try the food!
