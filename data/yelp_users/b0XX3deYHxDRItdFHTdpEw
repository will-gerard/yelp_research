Went to get my first spray tan here and the girls were so friendly and knowledgable! My tan so far is beautiful! I can't wait to go back!

I have gone to auto shops multiple times and I HATE IT. They always try to rip me off and assume I don"t know anything about my car and talk to me like I'm dumb.  I was dreading just having to get my oil changed but as soon as I arrived and dropped my car off Maurice was very kind!  Once I went to pick my car up Maurice said my car has a couple of other things wrong with it but wasn't totally pressuring me to get it fixed right then and there. He did let me know how important it was to get those things fixed but wasn't being nearly as pushy as every other auto shop I've been to.  To say the least, I will be back here for all my vehicles needs!

This place has great tasting Chinese food for pretty good prices...the reason I'm giving it one star was because my sister found a dead black bug that looked like a water bug in the chicken fried rice...not so appetizing if you ask me....I won't be back here.

So glad I got to finally experience the infamous chicken & waffles! This place was soooo good! The waiter was really funny and polite, which was definitely another plus. I will definitely be back!

Honestly I would give this place ZERO stars. I saw all the great reviews, made the appointment, very friendly woman at the front, nice inside facility but boy was I deceived.   I got my 8 month old kitty spayed yesterday, when I went to pick her up she seemed to be okay. I had been instructed to start a medication called TUAL at 7pm, same day. My kitty had an allergic reaction to it an hour after I gave her the oral medication, now, I know all animals have their allergies BUT I ended up taking her to the EMERGENCY ANIMAL CLINIC because she had a small fever, her face was swelling up, these bright pink/red spots showed up on her face, and she was crying in pain. (today she is still slightly swollen in the face even better than the picture I had posted which was post treatment from the severe swelling)  Got to the clinic, after they had injected her with steroids, fluids, etc and asked if I gave her any medications I was instructed to and sure enough, TUAL was guilty of nearly KILLING MY BABY!! The DOCTOR has never even heard of TUAL and was surprised I was given whatever TUAL is. Gave me only 2 pages of discharge instructions, NOT including the medication instructions/descriptions. VERY GENERAL discharge instructions. Also, apparently I owe $17 because she was already in heat, according to them, but they could be lying to me to squeeze more money out of me, I mean, an animal ER clinic/DOCTOR that has been around for years has never heard of TUAL.  Long story short, save yourself from POSSIBLY HURTING YOUR FURRY FAMILY MEMBER AND a $400 ER hospital bill ALONG SIDE WASTING $80+ on a spay/neuter clinic that prescribes medications that other doctors have NEVER heard of!!!!!!!!!!   I CANNOT stress this enough, I even made a yelp account just to write this review, for the sake of your precious family member(s) AVOID AZTEC ANIMAL HOSPITAL OF SCOTTSDALE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  "I do not consider my cat a pet, my cat is FAMILY."

I honestly don't know why there are so many bad reviews. The staff is great, they made me comfortable and actually cared. I didn't end up waiting for long at all. They saw me on time, and I was out of there by no time.

My boyfriend took me to this place and wow I love shoes and got nice Jessica Simpson heels for only $12! Great place for mostly shoes and accessories in my opinion.

Went here for lunch the other day, the fries weren't that great but their burgers were delicious. Although, I added avocado to my burger and it was a mistake. Their avocado was mushy and just tasted awful! That was pretty disappointing. Pretty pricy for the quality of food.

I haven't gotten my hair cut from a professional in a long time...I'm talking years and for the reason of them ALWAYS cutting way too much of my hair off. I went here the other day and was so scared I'd walk out with a bob. Like always. At this great clips that was not the case! Amanda showed me how much she would be cutting off before cutting it off! She cut 3", layered it, and framed my face no problem! I finally found a place I could go to instead of me having to do it myself. So glad I took the chance here! I highly recommend this place if you were like me, never happy with my haircuts. :)

Bought from Patrick, so easy, no hassle! Also had minor things wrong with the car and they were fixed as soon as possible. No problems at all. So happy!

I LOVE this place! Such reasonable prices and mouthwatering.  I'm obsessed with their red beef burrito. Always my go-to. I also tried their pomegranate lemonade slush....SO GOOOOOD.

I would give this place zeros stars. I went to get a basic oil change, no problems. They called me saying my serpentine belt was cracked and two very minor things. So of course because the serpentine belt is very important, I had them fix it. The following day my car stalled out more than 5 times, has had problems accelerating and wouldn't accelerate at all. Took it back in, had them check the tension on the serpentine belt, see if the oil was over filled or something but no, according to Efrain, the mechanic who so kindly messed up my car and wouldn't own up to his mistake, said there's nothing wrong with it. After over an hour of telling them my car was fine PRIOR to taking it into their shop they tried to make me feel stupid and basically called me a liar because it wasn't stalling for Efrain when he drove it. The stalling is intermittent but does happen everyday now. They said bring it in as soon as it stalls but what's that going to do? Nothing. I can't drop everything and say oh my car is stalling I have to go back to fletchers to prove to them my car isn't running right. I KNOW HOW MY CAR DRIVES, which was perfectly fine before they touched it. After I told them I will not be back there because of how they tried to belittle me, the woman at the desk gave me a very sarcastic "I am sorry you feel that way..." And the mechanic Efrain just went to the back and was laughing with another mechanic. I will not be back here and I suggest taking your car elsewhere. Their customer service is terrible, they are absolutely RUDE. The only pro was the manager was very sweet and apologetic.  Again, save your money and take it anywhere else but here.

I am a current Camden resident and I want to start with what's great about it. They allow many dog breeds, which I think is wonderful (I always see people walking their dogs around) AND the owners pick up after their pups mess. The apartments themselves are beautiful! Recently a resident parking sticker is required otherwise you could get towed, which I AM SOOOO HAPPY about. Don't worry if you have visitors, depending on how long they are staying, you will have to send an email to the office or just go up to the office and let them know. Which is no big deal. The gym is a nice one, I've been in there once....lol. As for the staff, my boyfriend and I have NEVER had any issues whatsoever. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. They always answer any questions we have without a problem. I also really like valet trash. Last but not least LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! I was in the real estate business for a while and let me tell you, the cost of living DOWNTOWN here at the Camden is affordable. You are ultimately paying for location people. My boyfriend and I LOVE being able to walk to all kinds of events happening in the downtown area.   Now for the cons of this complex. The building itself is not well insulated/soundproof. We do hear our neighbors. My boyfriend is more sensitive to noise than I am. Our neighbors upstairs have been very noisy lately and we complained to the office but one night getting ready for bed we heard one of the neighbors snoring......yes snoring....so that tells you how crappy the insulation/soundproofing is here. For me, the noise only bothers me when i'm beyond exhausted. The office also does not accept packages anymore which is pretty annoying. Good thing the post office is nearby, somewhat a hassle still. The last thing I dislike is there is not a Fry's nearby...only Safeway...BOOO! Haha.  In short, if you're very sensitive to noise, you may want to look at your options. Otherwise the cost of everything is affordable for living downtown. I do really enjoy it here. :)

Went here for my first float last night. The staff was super friendly and welcoming. Everything went smoothly. I have a hard time letting go but here, the environment made it so easy just to let go. There is absolutely nothing like floating. If you have not yet experienced floatation therapy I highly recommend you do. I felt a little bit sleepy after but that's normal for your first couple of floats. I do however feel no pain in my upper shoulders anymore. I am very satisfied and will be purchasing a membership.

Okay, this is the best donut place I've been to. I always get a dozen donuts for cheap and they always throw in a couple extra. The donuts always taste so fresh. Very friendly staff all the time! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! :)

I had THE BEST drink ever here. I forgot what it was called but it was phenomenal. I was overwhelmed by the menu but the bartender asked a couple of questions and voila, came up with a perfect drink for me. Definitely my favorite bar in Phoenix hands down!

Just had lunch here and I am in love! I am newly vegetarian and eating out is tricky! Especially since my boyfriend is still an omnivore. We both will be eating here again. My boyfriend said the chorizo tacos were amazing and he couldn't tell the difference from the real thing! I had the avocado sandwich and it was so flavorful. Their fries have a hint of sweetness and I LOVE it!! Vegetarian/vegan or not, this is a great place to eat!   Only con is parking. Frisky parking if you ask me! Lol

Went to float for the second time and it was so much better than the first time. The staff here was very warm and welcoming. The tea was fantastic. I will look into purchasing a membership as soon as possible! :)

My boyfriend got the Southeast, which is a Vietnamese inspired coffee that has cinnamon and condensed milk in it & I got the southwest, which has cinnamon in it too! Both were really good. I'm a big coffee person and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Customer service could've been better, the girl was super friendly, this older man was pretty nice but I said "thank you" to them and got no "you're welcome" my mother taught me these basic manners. Sure I'm probably being a little too anal about it haha but either way, I'll definitely be back!  :)
