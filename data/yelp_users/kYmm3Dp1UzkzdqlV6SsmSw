First let me preface this review with the fact that it was late when we dined there, about an hour before closing.   The service was fabulous. Best service I've had in some time and very professional.   I ordered the Linguini with Clams and my husband ordered Spaghetti Bolognese. Both came with either soup or salad. The soup was good, the salad was very over dressed - the dressing was great, just way too much of it on the salad.  The Spaghetti was good, and the Bolognese sauce was nice and flavorful & a bit spicy. The pasta was more than al dente, but still good.  Unfortunately my dish was not good. There was a very small pile of way over cooked linguini under a very healthy serving of clams. I don't mean the pasta was just a bit over cooked, it was totally mushy & broken into little pieces. I wouldn't serve Linguini in that condition at home even on a week night in a rush!  The clams were swimming in sauce - which I was kind of excited about - I love lots of sauce. But the sauce was bitter. Perhaps from cooking too long, I'm not sure. It was just very sharp and bitter.   My husband wanted to send it back, but the kitchen staff had apparently already left per our waiter.   I ate about half of it - only be aide I was so hungry. And there wasn't really any other option if the cooks were gone.  We were still charged for the dish, which I didn't think was appropriate.   Not a good experience.

It's been over a year since the last time I went to Pizzeria Bianco, and I am admitedly a very harsh pizza critic. The first time I went to Bianco's I loved the pizza. It was incredible.    This time, a friend was in town and wanted to go to the famous "Pizzeria Bianco" so we went at lunch to avoid the 2 hour wait.  To be very honest, the pizza just wasn't that good - over cooked & dry.  The salad was good & the bread was great, but we went for the pizza!   There was no wait at lunch & the service was better. But I have to say that the pizza at Grazies & The Parlor are better. The incredible dough was always the best thing about the pizza at Biancos...but it was not very good this time. It's lost the chewiness and was more like a cracker.   So unfortunately, I won't be back. Grazie's has become my pizzeria of choice in town now.

Korean food is incredibly flavorful.....and I can confidently say that Ohya's food is incredibly flavorful.  We have been coming here for quite a few years - and we just keep coming back for more. And we keep bringing friends here and one for one, they love it!  Kimchi is fresh & pungent & wonderful. BBQ is fabulous. We love the pork & the squid.  I grew up in LA so I know good Asian food & this is very good.

Excellent food. Quality ingredients prepared simply, and so tasty! Love sitting by the oven in the open kitchen...watching the chefs work!

I met a client at the JW Marriot for lunch, and we ate at the Meritage Steakhouse since not much else is open for lunch. Big disappointment. It looks like a mediocre resort restaurant - I expected more.   Service: We got there at about 11:20, it was empty and we were seated quickly. The waiter came over and took our drink orders fairly quickly. However he dropped the sugar container on the floor between 2 diners, and never picked it up the entire meal.  We ordered and the food came fairly soon...but when the waiter served it he handed off some dishes to us mid-air, rather than putting it on the table. Just seemed odd, as he could have reached to put it on the table...and it was hot soup! He didn't smile much and was not very friendly or helpful throughout the meal.   When asked by my client if there was anything he recommended on the menu (since he hadn't said anything when he came up to take our orders), he sort of shrugged and finally said, " it depends on what you feel like, something light and healthy or greasy and rich" Then he said he liked the French Dip Sandwich best.  I honestly don't think the guy ever said, "Enjoy your meal!"  Food: I had the "large" Meritage Salad & Onion soup: The onion soup was overly sweet with a thin layer of cheese on top. The salad was supposed to have goat cheese in it and I think I found one little piece...and the salad was small, and really not very flavorful. My client had the Lobster Bisque & Crab Cakes: the soup had a nice flavor, but no chunks of lobster at all. She enjoyed the crab cake...there was only one. Servings were generally somewhat scant. My coworker had the Turkey Sandwich: Looked like the pressed "deli" turkey you get at the supermarket....she ended up eating about half the sandwich and left most of the fruit side dish that looked like the pre-cut up fruit you buy at the store. Another coworker had the French Dip sandwich: She enjoyed it and the big onion rings that came with it.  Overall, the meal was mediocre. Possibly their dinners, steaks, etc. are better....but after that kind of lunch, I'd never go back to try it...and I'd be willing to bet they are not.

Love Postinos.  Decent selection of wines, great food - especially the Bruschetta which is hands-down my favorite in town...and it's a lively fun place to hang out. Great for lunch, happy hour, dinner or late night.  The only thing that is not great is the parking - I hate being forced to valet.

The food was ok...once we got past the rude host at the front (maybe the maitre d'  - a tall guy with a mustache & little beard). We arrived at 3:52 pm on a Tuesday. The restaurant was nearly empty. There were 7 of us with 3 more coming. The host asked if we had reservations, we said no, we'd been at an event & were going to the game.   He said he couldn't seat us as there were others who DID make reservations. (yes, he said it as if it were in CAPS!) We had to ask if the patio (which is huge & has misters) was available - yes. Then we asked if we could have a table inside if we promised to be gone by 5. He reluctantly agreed.  When my wine arrived, there was an insect in it. Our. Waiter was nice & replaced it.  The food was decent - we just had salads & appetizers. I had the Antipasta which was very small, and only came with 2 small pieces of bread. It did come with tart cherry preserves which were great.  A friend had the Tabbouli salad, which was ok, and another had the Salmon Rillette which was good. The food was ok, but nothing to write home about.   When We left promptly at 5, the restaurant was still half empty. I had looked forward to trying this restaurant... but I probably won't go back due to the rude host turning away patrons from an empty restaurant.

I am picky about Haunted Houses and horror films. I love them. But they have to be good.   13th Floor was really good. Great props, great sets, great costumes and some really scary parts!  We had a fabulous time. Even while waiting in line to get in, creepy characters came out and worked the crowd! That made it a lot of fun and helped pass the time waiting.  If you don't like to be scared, and are grossed out by blood, guts or dismembered body parts - in dark, creepy, cold places...then don't go.  If you love those things, like I do, then make sure you go! We loved it.

Love the food. Love the patio. Love the decor. Love that it is so close to our house.  The bar is gorgeous. The food is great. They have a Brie soup that is to die for. My husband orders it every time we go there...The food is cooked in their pizza oven and is fabulous.   Great wines too. I had an unusual white wine last night that was fabulous.   I think I'd be totally happy with a glass (or 2) of wine, an order of their incredible bread straight out of the oven, and a bowl of brie soup!

I'll comment on something that was great first - the decor! Very modern but warm with wood, glass and metal. It's a bit loud, but it was Friday night, so pretty busy. The seating was comfortable, nice looking bar, etc. The the lighting over the bar area was gorgeous.   I really wanted to like this restaurant - Phoenix Magazine certainly did...it's on their Top 10 New Restaurants list in the current issue. From the raving review, it sounded great -- so a group of us hopped on the Metro and headed downtown to try it Friday night.   To sum it up, Phoenix magazine needs to hire new food critics - this is not one of the top 10 new restaurants in Phoenix this year.   The service was mediocre. The waiter forgot 2 dishes, and was irritated because we were trying to figure out who owed what on the bill...while we had our coffee.  For appetizers, we had the Tater tots, deviled eggs & the caramel corn for appetizers: The tater tots were very flavorful. The deviled eggs were okay, but not great. Just not spiced well. The caramel corn was really good with the chili pepper and caramel sort of blending together.    The short ribs on a bed of blue cheese grits was really very good, probably the best thing on the menu.  The pork neck was bland. The ceviche was not very chilled, and also tasted bland. The Kale salad was ok, but kinda just a big pile of chopped kale with dressing on it and a few croutons tossed on top. Two people had the mac & cheese and thought it was good, but the serving was really small.   The wine I had was pretty good, but they didn't have the one on the menu that I wanted so suggested the wine they'd replaced it with. (only the replacement wine was $12 a glass & the one I'd wanted was $8!)  Several other people had cocktails and they all enjoyed them. So I'm thinking the bar is probably the highlight of this restaurant!  Sorry, but Blue Hound is just not even near the top 10 new restaurants.

I am a big Upward Projects fan. Love love love Postinos. And I really love what they are doing with the older buildings on Central. Federal Pizza is in an old bank building (by Al Beadle), with a really nice open layout, big windows, a nice patio out front, retro decor - every table had different salt & pepper shakers & there are different mid-century lights around the building. And the kitchen is open with the oven right out there in view. Loved the decor.   I went with friends from work for lunch the other day, (maybe a week after they opened) and then with another friend from out of town & my husband last night.  The food was fabulous each time!  Loved the wood-fired pizza. The dough is great - chewy and crisp all at once (cudos to Michael Coe) - probably the second best in town. Better than Bianco's & better than the Parlor. Maybe not quite as good as, but very very close to Grazies. I've had the Manifesto (with Schriners sausage), the Casanova (with arugula, dates & prosciutto) and the Big Star Pizza (Schriners Sausage, red & Yellow peppers, roasted onions, etc.). They were all great.   We also had the Corn Coins (both times!) - roasted corn with cheese, herbs & salt - cut into little coins that are great to munch on.  We also had the baratta & bread, which was good...but I think they could have added some kind of little tid-bit to go with it as baratta is good, but best when you have something else spicy/sweet/savory to put a dab on it with the bread.   We also had the wedge salad last night - and it was great. Very flavorful, nice fresh lettuce, crispy bacon, etc. We loved it. Next time I'll order my own rather than sharing...it was that good.  I was particularly excited to try their "wine coolers"...but don't even think about the bottles sweet wine cooler things in the grocery store. I had the Grapefruit & ginger wine cooler, and it was spectacular. I loved it. So fresh & flavorful and just a tiny bit sweet.   Service was great both times - our waiter at lunch was incredibly helpful and made great suggestions.  I can't wait to go back for Happy Hour - they have the 5$ before 5 deal just like Postinos.   Great new restaurant - go try it!

Fabulous food!  We had the combo kabobs - Meats were very flavorful. They also had great sauces (tahini & a couple of others). The service was great - Ronnie & Heather were super helpful. We will absolutely be back!
