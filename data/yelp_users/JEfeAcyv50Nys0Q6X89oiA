The food is great, the service is terrible!!! In the last two orders we have had they have been messed up. In fact, when we were there today the table next to us had a mess up in their order as well. They also had two people walk out because of how many bagels were out of stock. Then we saw a worker answer her cell phone and go in to the back. If they paid attention to the orders as much as they did their phones they would be an amazing establishment. I will go out of my way now to go to a different location. Such a bummer!

I don't typically give any 5 stars on yelp, however Sure Temp Air Conditioning went WAY above and beyond in my case. I received a new AC unit with my home warranty company. 6 months later my brand new AC stopped working. After 3 weeks of getting the run around my home warranty company Sure Temp came out to my home (they were not the original installers) and fixed my AC unit. Not only did they fix it, they noticed it had been installed improperly and went back to the home warranty company and instead of it costing me $1300 out of pocket they had the home warranty cover 100% of it . Over the last three weeks I have had multiple AC companies come out and treat me so poorly, lie to me to get money, etc. Sure Temp came out, got every thing fixed and fought on my behalf. I would recommend them to anyone and consider them one of the few trustworthy AC companies out there. I will continue to go to them for all of AC needs!! Thank you so much Sure Temp!!

My fianc√© and I are sushi lovers and have been to revolving sushi places before so we thought we would try this one out.   Price- The plates are color coded and the most common color is blue which is $2.00.  You get 3 very small pieces of room temperature sushi.   Quality- This is very low quality sushi. I'll clarify by saying that I'm not afraid I'm going to get sick, but I wish I would have just picked up some from the grocery store because at least the fish is cold.   Close Alternate Option: I would go to Orient Sudhi on McQueen and Elliot for $3.50 you get an entire roll prepared fresh.   The Positive: This place is EXTREMELY clean and I couldn't have asked for a better wait staff. Just wish their food matched their service. We won't be back. :-/

My husband and I go here every now and then. The first time we were there we got the pork and loved it!! In fact, overall the food is good. I think they have some of the best chips around and they have good salsa. In fact, if it was just for the food I would give this four stars.   So why did I give them one?! Well, it has to do with the service and not necessarily the wait staff. I have loved the waitress and waiters we have had (except for one). Our second time there we sat in the dining room and the service was soooo slow. What made it worse was I could see my waiter doing nothing but talking (I haven't seen the waiter since). We have sat in the bar ever since so it hasn't been an issue. Our last visit we ordered the fried ice cream which was delicious until we found a hair!!! Ugh. The next time we ordered an entree to split and sure enough, another hair! Honestly this one was sitting right on top and we hadn't started eating yet so it wasn't a huge deal, the waitress immediately took it and got us a new one! However, when the owner brought us the new entree there was not so much as an apology!!! I wasn't looking for a discount or anything but to not even acknowledge the grossness of what happened made me so upset. Needless to say we won't be back, which is a bummer because there food is good. Hopefully they see this and start making the kitchen staff wear hair and beard nets (we saw the chef and there was no net).
