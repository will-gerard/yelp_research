My husband and I came here for our one year wedding anniversary. We have been here several times before and I love it. The food is so good and the dessert is the best part. Our server was very friendly, helpful, and gave us everything we needed. We had a great night. I will keep coming back to this place.

My husband and I came here to eat before seeing a movie. He always wants to go eat at a deli place and I usually turn him down because I am not a big sandwich person. Normally deli places don't have very much selection and I can be very picky. However, I remembered Dilly's Deli is a place that I loved. They have bread bowl with broccoli and cheese soup or clam chowder. Yum. I suggested it to my husband and he was so excited. We ate there and of course I ordered a bread bowl and salad. My husband ordered a sandwich and a bread bowl. He loved it. Now we have a place to go to when y husband is craving a sandwich. I gave Dilly's 4 stars only because the floor looked kind of dirty and it needs some decorations. It is pretty depressing in there, but the food is great.

My husband and I live close by and decided to try Alessia's. When we walked in we were greeted by the bartender who said the hostess would be right back. We waited a few minutes and she never came. I was hugging my husband and this waiter decided to come up behind me and say hello as if he were going to seat us. I immediately let go of my husband only to find that he was just saying hi. The hostess still was not there so after a minute the waiter seated us and told us to sit where ever we wanted. So what was the point of waiting at all??? Anyways...  We browsed the menu and noting really seemed that appetizing to me. My husband asked the waiter how big the portions are for the fettuccine alfredo. The waiter looked at my husband like he was an idiot for asking such a question and said, " I don't know, like average?  Does that make sense?" My husband was pissed, but blew it off as to not ruin the evening. We ordered the fettuccine alfredo to split which came with a salad. The salad was good, but the alfredo tasted like EASY MAC! I would have sent it back, but I didn't want to make my husband feel bad because he chose the restaurant and I was hungry. The alfredo wasn't enough food, so we decided to order calamari from our SECOND waiter. Yes, they have multiple waiters as if they are TRYING to be a FIVE star restaurant, which they are not even close. Then our FIRST waiter came back to ask us if we wanted dessert, when we had just ordered something. I just think it is unorganized and confusing to have five different waiters. I felt like no one knew what was going on and that we kept getting interrupted.   Normally at Italian restaurants the calamari is fried, but not here. They set it in front of us and I was horrified. I did not want a nasty rubbery ring tomato soup. We sent it back and decided to just forget ordering anything else. We received our bill and noticed there was a $4 charge for "splitting" the EASY MAC. This place is such a rip off. We paid $18 for a two small bowls of EASY MAC. We did not see on the menu that there was a charge for splitting meals because if we had we would have not split a meal. I will never in my life come back to this place ever again!

My husband and I had eaten here once before with our family about a year ago. My husband said he really wanted to eat here again. Even though I did not really care for the food last time I said okay. We sat in the main dining area which is very pretty. It has a fountain and there is a lot to look at. We order two appetizers to share. We ordered a cheese crisp and a sampler appetizer. The sampler appetizer was pretty bad. They give you a fried bean burrito which has way too much cheese, a nasty meatless tamale which tasted like dirt, a tostada which hardly had any beans, and these little taquitos which were the highlight of the meal. I will not ever come back here. By the way, my husband was disappointed with the food as well. I gave it two stars because of the decor and our waitress was nice.

Every weekend my husband and I love to go out on a date. It is our time to be alone, relax, and have a great time together. Our favorite thing to do on date night is to eat out at a restaurant we can both agree on. We decided to try a restaurant we have never been to which is called Sauce. I was very skeptical of this place because many Italian restaurants are very similar, boring, and bland. I realized I was very wrong from the moment I walked into the door. Sauce Pizza and Wine is an excellent choice to dine out because it is affordable, has great service, and serves fresh and tasty food.         One of the most common reasons my husband and I eat out only once a week is because the cost is so high. At the average restaurant our bill could easily be forty dollars not including the tip for just the two of us which is quite a bit of money for a family on a budget. When we eat at Sauce we know that we are getting the best quality food for the best price. There are many places that have low prices, but many of them do not have quality service like Sauce.      Exceptional service is a key element in choosing a restaurant and Sauce has it. As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted by smiling faces. They also waited patiently as we looked over the chalkboard menu on the wall. The line moves very quickly because the staff is very knowledgeable about their menu. After ordering, we went to find a clean table which was not difficult at all. Sauce routinely cleans all unoccupied tables to ensure that their new guests are able to sit down. Less than ten minutes later a server brought our food which was hot, fresh, and ready for us to eat.       Sauce has a variety of foods in which any person could find a dish to fall in love with. Most people come here for the pizza, but if you are on a healthy diet they have many delicious salads.  Each ingredient is listed in a way that demonstrates the zesty menu that Sauce provides.        Sauce is one of the best restaurants I have visited because the price is right, the service is exceptional, and the food is amazing. I have always felt that pizza was a food I ordered in at home because I was too lazy to make anything or did not want to wait around for a sit down meal at a restaurant. My view of pizza eateries has definitely changed because I know that Sauce is a place I can go for a quick and delicious meal.

I went into this hair salon today as a recommendation from a friend. I am glad I did. Addie is one of the stylists there and she did a great job! She made sure she knew exactly what I wanted and cut it perfectly. She was very nice and I will definitely be back! No more Great Clips for me. It was only 36 dollars for a cut and style and I have really long hair. It probably would have cost me almost as much at Great clips, but I usually just have them cut it because they charge extra for "styling". I love my new hair! :)

This Circle K is one of the worst I have been to. I went in last night to get a coffee and a snack. When I walked in there was a young employee sitting on the counter talking to a guy. She quickly got off of the counter when she saw me. She did not bother to say hi either. I got my coffee and snack and proceeded to walk to the checkout. The young girl was behind the counter doing who knows what. There was a lady in front of me waiting to pay as well. After about 2 minutes of waiting for her to acknowledge our presence, she said, "I will be with you in a minute." She did not seem very busy when we came in because of course she had time to talk to a guy. When she finally was going to cashier she says, "Oh, this register isn't open. I am on the other side over here." So the lady had to move all of her items to the other counter. Then an older lady came out and went behind the register. I did not realize she was opening her register. I thought she was fooling around like the other girl. I was already frustrated and just waiting to pay. A guy walks up to the old lady's counter and she proceeds to scan his items. I said, "Oh, thanks for taking me first." She says, "Well, I waved at you so...." I said, "So I did not see you." I was so angry that I did not even want my items anymore. I left them on the counter and left. Very bad customer service.

I have had my nails done here before with no problem. I like the lady who runs the place as well. I had my nails done here on Dec. 19th and everything was fine. About a week later and both my big toes started hurting. I think they are infected. I don't think I will ever get another pedicure ever again...

So the update is I ended up going to the doctor about 5 times, I was on antibiotics for 2 weeks, I got shots in my toe, had my toe cut into to try and drain the fluid, had to go to a podiatrist,  and now I have no big toenail. I had to have my toenail removed all because I went to get a pedicure. Never again will I get my nails done. I suggest you do the same.

I have never eaten here before and I don't think I will ever come back. I arrived around 5:30 pm with my parents, my son, and my niece. Chompie's has a patio so we asked to sit outside. There were other people sitting outside as well. The hostess said, "Let me check to see if someone will serve you out there." From my experience working at restaurants with patios, if someone wants to sit outside, you seat them outside. Anyways, she came back and said, "Oh the patio is closed now." Since when do restaurants close the patio especially on a beautiful day like yesterday? I wanted to complain, but just shrugged it off. The menu is very large, but nothing looked very appetizing to me. I ordered the caesar salad and baked potato soup. The soup was okay, but the salad was not very good. It was mostly iceberg lettuce and did not have much taste at all. Not impressed at all.

I love this place. I usually don't care for New Mexican food, but this place is awesome.    The salsa is great, I love their salads and everything else I have ever ordered from there. I will be back!

I went here on a date with my husband on Saturday in the late afternoon. When we walked in a guy greeted us and he was very nice. We sat down and given menus a few minutes later. They don't have very much variety on their menu which was disappointing. Our waitress came to the table and she was not the friendliest. I ordered chips and salsa and the mac and cheese. My husband ordered some kind of sandwich and it came with salad as well. We waited and waited for the chips and salsa that never came. The guy who originally greeted us brought our food. A few minuted later the waitress came over and said, "Oh, we don't have chips so that's why you did not get your chips". She did not apologize and just walked away. That would have been nice to know before so maybe I could have ordered a different appetizer. Our waitress never checked on us again and did not ask how we liked the food. I did like the mac and cheese, but I don't think I would go out of my way to go here again. I also liked the salad that came with my husbands meal. I liked the decor, but thought the music was a bit loud.

My husband and I came here for a date night and we had soooo much fun! Everyone was hysterical and we loved it. The only draw back is that they have a two drink minimum and just to get a soda it is $5, but it will not stop me from coming back and having a good time! We even got free tickets to come back and see another show. I can't wait...

My husband and I came back to the club for a second time on our wedding anniversary. I was so excited to see that they got rid of the two drink minimum which is awesome. Show was great as usual. We will be coming back again! :)

I was looking to join a gym in my area and went to about 4 locations and this one was by far the cheapest option for me and my son. The membership is cheap and so is daycare which is awesome. I have been pretty happy with the services here. I go in the morning and its not too crowded. I also like the movie room where I can do some cardio and not get bored. I think I will be staying at this gym for awhile.

I love this place! Threading is so much better than a wax! It lasts twice as long as a wax and they do a great job. Fast and easy.

I ate here with a couple friends yesterday and it was delicious!  I ordered the carne asada tacos with rice and beans...so good! They also had really good salsa and guacamole.  The staff was very friendly and I loved the decor.  I will definitely be back!
