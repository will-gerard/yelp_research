If I could give this car wash Zero stars I would, I came in on a Monday right before they closed so I was last car there , I got the VIp package, they didn't clean anything! My car was dirty they didn't wipe down the interior they pretty much just cleaned the outside, it's sad because with my older car they always did a good job, Idntk what happened, I won't come back.

I have never been to a restaurant where literally every single employee looked like they hated working there. First time I had ever been there was last week. First, let me start off by saying we had 3 different waiters tell us they would bring our drinks. 10 minutes later, still nothing. Mind you, it was busy so me and my friend did understand. Next, we asked for a high chair for our 2 year old child right when we walked in. We were placed at a table with chairs, not a booth(which we were totally okay with), but trying to keep a 2 year old child to sit safely in a chair is difficult to do. We waited 15 minutes for a high chair.   The food came extremely fast which was great. But our drinks were not filled up until we asked for a refill. My drink was so empty I was eating the ice out of it. When we were done eating, we got our receipts. My friend who had eaten here before told me "I think if you pay with card at the front." (Again, this was my first time here). The waitress comes back to us and I said "do you we pay with you?" The waitress responds with "well unless you wanna wait then I suggest you do". Attitude much? The workers here are so rude.   Anyways, so I thought I would try this place out one more time because they have pretty good food. We get there, get seated right away, they asked what drinks we wanted, I requested an iced tea with lemon. Drinks Come back, no lemon. Whatever. No big deal I guess. Food comes, our waitress checks on us ONCE. Oh by the way, me and my friend got hash browns, they weren't cooked all the way. I stopped eating mine because it was so gross. The waitress comes back and asked if we wanted separate bills, we say yes. We are sitting where we can see into the kitchen. And we just see her cleaning and staring right at us. 10 minutes later waiting for our bill, my friend decides to start stacking up the plates so maybe someone will notice we are done. She finally brings the bills, I say thank you, (as I did every time she did something for us) and she just walks away. Geez lady a you're welcome would've been nice! Never eating there again. All the workers hate working there. You can just feel the tension. I suggest not eating here unless you want rude workers who might or might not spit in your food depending on the day they are having.

Fresh unique amazing Japanese food, seriously everything here is just perfect, service is always friendly and fast, has great happy hour deals I come here at least once or twice every week. My favorite roll is the Rainbow sushi roll but all the other ones are pretty good too. I'd recommend this place if you want to get good sushi and good prices !!!
