I love Keegans. Does anyone know their secret to the grilled wings? I would love to duplicate them as close as possible. Im addicted to these thing! I love th beef stroganoff too! We visit this place about once a week. Usually the Ocotillo location though! And almost forgot to mention, the cheesy potatos are delish too! As well as the tomato bacon, I believe it was soup. Also enjoyed the crab cakes on special one evening but havent seen them again since.

Went here yesterday on our way to the Mesa waterpark. We love breakfast and this place definitely met our expectations. They had a big menu with lots to choose from. My boyfriend got the breakfast burritos and he loved it. I had the biscuits and gravy. We were very pleased and will be back soon!

We go here frequently for lunch. We love the buffalo caesar salad. The service is really going downhill at lunch. We filled our own drinks a few times at our last visit. 2 out of 3 of our orders were wrong. Our waiter was training a new waitress -- might want to rethink allowing him to train bc he made many mistakes serving us. Wrong order, No drink refills, and reminded him 2 times about our bank of america discount and he still forgot. Guess its time for a new weekly lunch spot.

Cheesecake is never disappointing. We went today for lunch, my boyfriend and I. We decided to split a small appetizer and then split a chicken parm sandwich. I placed the order, and the waitress asked if we wanted salad or fries, I said fries. Then the BF decides he wants to be the boss of the relationship and ordered salad. Ha, he is just so funny. So when the waitress passed back by I said can please have the salad and a side of fries. She said, "I was gonna bring you some fries anyways". What a great waitress she was. She was very good at keeping our ice teas full and kept us stocked on ice too. It was once again, Another great experience at Cheesecake Factory. I love this place! A bit pricey if you dont split the orders but its always a good meal! Love it!

Not my favorite place. I went today to get added RAM for my MAC computer. I was unable to purchase this at the apple store due the fact that apple only carries current stuff in their store bc space is limited. The guy that was helping at Best Buy, not friendly, not knowledgable, unable to answer questions I had. Needless to say, I did not purchase from Best Buy. Off to Frys electronics I go.

In all honesty, I LOVE NORDYS! And I do LOVE MAC. But,..................... over the weekend, on sat. evening I decided to trade in some of my 20 plus back to macs. When I arrived at the counter, It was very busy as always :) They really need a stand lone, MAC store in this mall. So a girl walks up and asks if I need help. I say yes, I have some back to MACs that I would like to recycle and I would like to look at blush and lip gloss as well. I had a list of colors I wanted to try. She helped line up all the colors for me. I asked if I could try them on and she cleaned them for me and told me they were good to try now. I must say, I have NEVER had a MAC girl not offer to put it on for me, NEVER. Then as I was doing it myself, a "friend" of hers is across the way and she was asking them, are you in a hurry, blah blah blah, and I could see her facial expressions in the close by mirror. She was NOT your nomral MAC girl. She was horrible, very bad customer service. I love MAC products, I have tons of it. I never leave a MAC counter without something new, its too irresistible and I think for department store make up the prices are very reasonable. But yesterday, I did leave empty handed ad I didnt even trade in my recycles. So thumbs down to MAC this weekend. Too bad for them, I will not be back to the MAC counter for a long while. So in all honesty, I must say NORDYS overall is a 5 and MAC usually is too but NOT today! :( Very disappointed bc I was well prepared for what I was looking to recyycle and purchase. Thumbs down!

I just went to this location. I ordered a mint Oreo blizzard. Got home only to find out it was a regular Oreo blizzard. Went back through the drive-through told them the order was wrong and they took the regular Oreo blizzard back and said they would get me a new one. When I pulled away I took the lid off only to realize my blizzard was like a milkshake. They must have just added the mint into the regular Oreo blizzard. The blizzard that was already half melted. If I wanted a milkshake, I would have ordered a milkshake. Not to mention it was $2.99 for a mini which might be all of 4 oz.

We live very close so we come here regularly. Spicy grilled chicken wings are delish. We also love the beef stroganoff. Service is always good. They have nice happy hour as well as reverse happy hour. Decent patio area when the weather is nice! Seems to be a bit of an older(retired) crowd, probably due to location. BTW, any tips on what they use in the wings?

This physician was highly recommended to me by more than one person. Unfortunately after several attempts of trying to make an appointment, I will NOT be seeing her. The scheduling line is lacking. I am abruptly placed on hold before I am able to speak. The hold time each attempt was over 10 minutes. Good luck with the staff if you choose to go here! I'm in the medical field and I think great staff is as important as a great physician.

One of the best breakfast places in my book. The apple pancakes are amazing, as well as the French toast! I lovebthwtbthey give you a carafe of iced tea instead of constant refills. As well as a carafe of ice water with a lemon slice! This is a must try in my book!! Worth the wait and drive, amazing staff.

Short and sweet! It is good, fresh and dependable. My favorite is the mongolian beef! Love it! We usually sit out if possible bc the cooking area is open to the seating area so its a bit loud. But Im a definite fan! Love it!

Do not go here for lunch. We just went here and it took over an hour and a half before we got our entrees. By this point we were full bc the courses were brought out so far apart. We spoke with the Manager who was very nice and understanding about our complaint. At this point I was not mad but what happened next is what put me over. I walked off without my entree which I put in a to go container bc by the time I got it I was too full to eat. It was my entire untouched entree. Before I even got in my car I realized I left it on the table. We went back to get it and they had already thrown it away. This all occurred during the lunch hour--they were not busy at all. I don't understand why they couldn't have set my container aside for a few minutes to make sure I didn't return for it. I'm beyond mad.

This place had amazing food but the customer service is definitely lacking. If you go and the place is packed the line wait is about 20 minutes, crazy for a in and out trpe of place. I really wish they could get quicker service lines, accurate to go orders and I'd give them 5 stars but for now due to service.

Finally was able to make it here for breakfast. My opinion, I will NOT be back. As we were walking up to the place, I said "O now this is the kind of place we should be taking our out of town visitors.". Well, on 2nd thought, NO. We went today, a weds, there was no wait and we were seated promptly. We were informed that the beverages was self serve as far as coffee, water, tea and lemonade goes. We started with tea-dislike, then lemonade-dislike. And did I mention we self served ourselves in a 12 oz cup with a price of $2.75, WOW! If it was to our liking, Id say that is still steep for a self serve drink in a 12oz cup. He had the monte cristo, which he liked but was not blown away for the price. I had the french toast and it was only ok. I also ordered a side of sausage that i DISLIKED and it was $4 for I think 2 links, WOW. And once our food came, the flys were EVERYHWERE. I kid you not when I say I couldnt wait to get outta there. I left very disappointed, and hungry. Will never return or recommend. But hey, try it for yourself, you may like it. I just think it was too high priced for what we got.

We came here last night for a quick bite to eat.  We sat in the bar area. It was during the NBA finals--the bar was understaffed. The menus were filthy.  The tables were not stocked -- no sugar carafe, no salt. My table seemed washed off however it was very sticky. Food was fair. Service was obviously slow/poor due to staffing. Someone in the kitchen area was cleaning a vent on the ceiling, not the appropriate time. So in my opinion, this place needs some management.

Im a fan. However I did have a bad experience, DO NOT get the banana, It is not good. And when asked if I could trade it I was told NO. This was my 1st visit and I did not know you could get samples ;( I explained that to the girl but she didnt care. So I left my yo on the counter and walked out anticipating to NEVER return. However, I called and complained and received a credit. I have never had a bad experience since!

Do not go to this location on your lunch break. I have been here twice in the last month and have waited in the drive-through line over 20 minutes each time. The food is good and hot but the wait time is horrible.

Went to Chick-fil-A at this location this morning. Finally is Saturday and I have time to get my favorite chicken minis. Pull up to the drive-through, place my order only to be told I'm sorry we are out of chicken minis today. How can you be out of chicken minis at a chicken only restaurant  on an early Saturday morning? This is very disappointing.  especially when this is the only reason I came here. Not to mention it's a royal pain in the butt to back out of a drive thru!

I am gonna do a new review bc my initial one was removed bc yelp said my complaint was an "employment issue". I will start out by saying I was not an employee. I am in the healthcare field. I would say I have to give Satya a thumbs down. My reasons:  1 Poor Customer Service 2 Inconsistence with stylists. They seem to have a high turnover and I like to use the same girl each visit and in my case, I had different stylists at each visit.  I tried contacting management via email and phone on several occasions with no resolution. Maybe you will have better luck but this is not your typical Aveda experience.

After reading the other reviews, I agree. Service not very good :( Took forever to get iced tea refills, and no sweet n low. Maybe need larger beverage glasses. We were on the patio and had to constanly ask for refills and extra ice (it was warm and the ice was melting fast). Service has lots of improving to do. Food was good. The thick cut bacon, not so good. Hope they can get the service issue better :)

Well we returned again today only to experience the exact same thing. We sat outside at the bar during breakfast as the wait was 20 mins, the hostesses suggested the outside bar area. It took approx 20 mins to get iced coffee. The people across from us sat down after us and was enjoying their blood marys long before our coffee arrived. My husbands order was incorrect. The girl next to us also received the incorrect order. My scrambles eggs were not very good. My breakfast potatoes were undercooked. Also, i asked for strawberry jam and didnt realize until i put it on my biscuit that they have me raspberry. $30 later, I'm still hungry and headed home. I really wanted to like this place bc it's within walking distance and has a nice atmosphere but I have to keep it at 2 stars.

Tonight was date night. The BF wanted to try Tia Rosa since we have been awaiting the arrival for sometime now. It is within walking distance so of course we had HIGH hopes for this place. And we were pretty disappointed.  Pros 1. Loved the decor. They went ALL out on this. Really does make you feel like you are in mexico.  2. The Bean Dip App was delish. We really LOVED every bite of it.  3. We went around 5 and was seated very promptly.  4. Margarita were pretty good but nothing to really rave about. Id prefer a mexican place with good margarita specials.  5. THey were quick and prompt with refilling my water.  6. The service was very prompt as far as getting our drinks and food to the table.   Cons 1. Service. Our waitress was not the friendliest. I asked if she recommended a margarita and she really didn't have a good answer. Kinda pointed at a few things but there was no,  "O Yes, You should def try..." I think being a new place in a new location the staff should be very informative and up beat.. When we ordered the enchiladas, we were told we could not have one beef and one chick. We had to pick one meat and one sauce. Not mix and match. Kinda odd, I said to her Ive never been to a place that doesnt allow that. Is there a reason? (bc maybe there is), she said I don't know. Ok then. I think with the economical status we are in, there must be more energetic upbeat people dying for a job.  2. Price. We had an app, 2 Margaritas, 2 entrees and split a friend ice cream. And our bill was $60. For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.  3. Chips. Each time we got chips there were about 15-20 per basket, the were constantly needing to refill them. Even with our BIG bowl of app bean dip, it came with about 20 chips and the bowl of dip was HUGE, the chip porportion was way off! 4. Extra sour cream, $1.00. WOW!  And in the middle 1. Fried Ice Cream, it was friend ice cream with strawberries. I really prefer the honey over the strawberry anyday. Wasnt my fave. And I LOVE fried ice cream.  2. Chips and Salsa were ok. Nothing to rave, I would say average.    I think with the place being new and in a great location, the management would be more hands on. I love more than anything when a manager walks the floor to check on the customers. I think that is AWESOME. But this didn't happen while I was there. In the end, I wanted to ask for the manager and tell them to go across the way and step inside Oreganos. BC those people that work over there are the friendliest and Happiest people Ive ever seen in the food service.   I would say to give Tia Rosa a chance and see what you think But in my opinion, I've had much better as far as mexican goes.   I look forward to the other side opening to see the menu and prices. I would def love to see if they have a happy hour bc Id love to go for the bean dip and Margaritas :)

We were here tonight. This is definitely a place I will not return.  I will say they allowed our dog on the patio,  that's the only nice thing I have to say. We waited over 45 minutes for our food. After 50 minutes, we went to the hostess and said we were leaving. As I was walking out, she came after us and said our food was ready,  "do we want it to go?" At this point, I was so over this experience, I said no thanks (if I'm going to spend money on food I want to sit down to enjoy it). She said "if you don't get it to go and pay your waitress will have to pay the bill". I said "what? That's redicilious, let me speak with the manager." He came out and immediately was defensive telling me that they were extra busy due to the street event and that the wait time on tickets were longer than usual. I told him just bc a place is busy is not an excuse for subpar service. Not once did anyone tell us they were experiencing long wait times. He was very argumentative with me and even said "Well you had a few ice teas didn't you?" Really??? How ridiculous, of course we had drinks, we are at a sit down bar and grill.  The whole experience was a joke! I will never return. At minimum, the manager could have apologized. But no he only wanted to argue and make excuses instead of apologize.

When it 1st opened it was like a secret place but it seems to be getting busier. We love it here--good and consistent. If we bring the pups and sit outside, they are very accommodating to us. Wish the outdoor was bigger and more shaded, enjoy sitting out. Everything I've ordered has been good. Great price and portions. Close to home. Biscuits and strawberry jam is sooo good. Yes the biscuits are small but, who cares, they are good. One day we had an extra long food wait so our waitress brought us out biscuits and jam to snack on--great service!

We decided to try this place since they have a new location not far from us. According to the reviews and waiter, the pizza is amazing. We started with the appetizer, rice balls. These were pretty good. Loved the sauce! Wish I had bread to dip in the sauce. We split a pizza which to me was so bland. The crust was flavorless, couldn't taste the sauce and the cheese was not quality either. Apparently their liquor license isn't good yet so the bar was empty. The set up was kinda odd to me. Its like a split floor plan. Then there was a little bakery type cooler that was empty. Maybe they are still getting things together but you think they'd have a sign saying that, or your waiter/waitress would tell you? Our waiter was friendly but not good on keeping up with the refills.  There isn't much decor, kinda plain Jane like the food. Then we say the table next to us get fresh bread, hmmm not sure why we didn't get any. We may give it another try in time and skip the pizza, not sure.

Do you ever walk into a place for the 1st time and think "Wow, this place is cool!" -- Well that is what I thought when I walked in here for the 1st time. I love the ambiance. I love that it is open with Big Garage doors open to the outside. I loved the decor. It seemed like a cool place to hang out at in the evenings. But----My love ended about as quickly as it started.  I went here today for a late lunch with a friend. We were pretty much the only ones there. She ordered the lunch pizza and I had the lunch burger. She said her pizza was ok but a big greasy on top. My burger was nothing special at all, pretty bland in my opinion. My fries were very soggy, not crisp at all.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. But unfortunately I don't think Ill be back. The prices on the regular menu seemed to be over priced. And after trying a few things I dont think I would be willing to pay those prices.  I hope that they will make some changes and step it up but thus far its lacking. The place definitely does have potential though. Good Luck Social Box.

I was very hesitant to share this bc right now its kind of a secret but thanks to Ocotillo Friends, the cats already out of the bag kinda. The Singing Panda is a new Asian Restaurant that opened only a few weeks ago in Chandler. They are located on Chandler Blvd. east of AZ AVE. If you like Asian you must try this place. It is the BEST I've ever had. And did I mention Im VERY picky and not easy to please when it comes to a perfect meal when I go out. I have expectations, and sometimes I think maybe they are too high. The owner, Sherry (hope I spelled her name correct), is the sweetest person and eager to satisfy her customers and is very proud of her food quality and family recipes. She plans on being in business for a long time to come so lets keep her busy and support the local places in Chandler. Today we tried the Crab Angles for starters, then Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken we shared. We wanted to start with the basics and go from there. Sherry has already informed us what we need to order at our next visit. She is so sweet. Think I many have even made a new friend there. I  do hope you like it as much as we did.
