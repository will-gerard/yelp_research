So my fiancé and I heard a lot of good things about this place, so we decided to give it a try. We placed an order for pick up, and when we got there, the guy behind the counter had his head phones in and was pretty rude, like he didn't want to be bothered.   So we got our food, we both ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich. The sandwiches were not good at all. The chicken was sliced, grilled, and tasted like it was microwaved. The best part of the sandwich was the cheese.   All in all, we were really disappointed and will not return. Big let down!

My experience started out by calling and speaking with Josh Decker about a used car they had on their lot. After speaking with him, I decided to go in and look at it. When I decided to move forward with purchasing the vehicle, Josh went above and beyond with making sure I got the best rate possible and making the purchase run smoothly.  I give them 4 out of 5 stars because when I bought the car, upon driving it home, my fiancé noticed the brake light was out and I also had a front light out. I called and told them right away and they replaced the lights with no charge to me. But I live an hour away and it was an inconvenience to drive the whole way there to have it done when they should have made sure all the lights were it proper working order upon selling the vehicle.    Overall though I am happy with the experience and everyone there was friendly and did a good job.

They did a really nice job tinting my car, and it's a difficult car to tint. The price was good and the people I talked to were really nice. I did have one issue with the tint not settling in the rear window, but since it has a warranty they replaced it for free with no hassle about it. Overall a good experience and I would highly recommend them.

I have been going to the Needle Supply for years to get supplies for my studio. They really care about the industry and the artists in it. They have good products at reasonable prices and I never have any issues with them.   All in all a very good place and I will continue to order my supplies from there!
