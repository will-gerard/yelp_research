I'm sure Curry Corner is a great place but tonight was not their night. The Palak Paneer was bland but my boyfriends Goat Haleem was good! My chai tea tasted like Lipton tea...ZERO spice and it took over 30 min to get my tea. The garlic naan was good and the cheesy naan was too cheesy, like imagine quesadilla on steroids. Unfortunately my night ended with a roach chillin to my right just crawling across the table......shit happens, it's gross but it is bound to happen at some point somewhere...this place is clean and new but I could not eat another bite, a roach is a definite deal breaker! I tried this place due to the triple D show but I think I'll stick to my joint down the street, Khoorinors.

Sooooo..... We had the chips and verde chicken to start and that was the shizz!!! I had the macaroni and cheese burger and my husband had the pb&j burger!! Both were super yummy and very filling for 5oz. Our server Laura was on point and most friendly! We will be back for sure!!!

A new favorite for us foodies! We are always on the look out for new and different and Vovomeena delivered! Between the Mexican Benedict and the B.M.O.C my BF and I were beyond satisfied. The Japanese cold brewed coffee was spectacular....try the lemon jalape√±o and the green tea mint flavors, you won't be disappointed

I had the M.I.L.F and it was the shit!! I split it with my lunch date for half of his Menage-A-Trois which was even better! If you haven't checked this sammy place out yet you need to!! They have over 100 different sandwiches, a kids menu, huge vegetarian selection and breakfast sandwiches! They bake the bread to order and add this sauce that is delicious the whole vibe just rocks;I have found a new sammich heaven!!!

2 stars is me being nice. Short review = go to Culinary Drop Out down the street.... FOR REALZ!!  The lower star reviews could not be more right! I thought well....let's try it out anyways...welp shame on me. The 2 stars are for average service, polite hostess and bacon wrapped dates. We ordered the Green Chilie Burger, Bacon wrapped dates and two beers. All of the reviews regarding them being out of beers is the straight truth!! Not only were they out of their own IPA, they had beers listed that they have not carried for 3 months now. The burger was severely undercooked and bland, the dates were on point but not worth 10 bucks...2.00 per date  when we brought up the issue of the undercooked burger we were given a shoulder shrugging "sorry"....lol ok whatever i'm never coming back here again....like never ever!
