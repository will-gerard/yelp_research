This has to be one of my favorite places for a flavor of a Mexican meal with the best cheese sauce ever. The green Chile on anything is delicious plus can't beat the $0.99 margaritas after three. The service is prompt and the food taste great. The atmosphere is lively yet personable. I love coming here.

This place is a nice place come in out of the heat to enjoy a chat with some friends and have some drinks and appetizers for their happy hour. The staff is attentive and a chill crowd. This is the unwinding spot....

Don't stop to use the bathroom then eat there. The bartender is the most rude person if the order was not place I would not have stayed after I heard that remark. Ruined my day diem town. So no I won't return. Not a happy camper.

I thought I'd give it another try but another disaappinment waited almost a half hour for a lunch plate... Club sandwich. Not difficult at all. The place was not even busy. I know I will not revisit any Zipps in town this was my third location and again it was a fail. Lesson learned. Note the food was tasteless and after waiting I did not want my meal anymore

This was my first time visiting this place. The interior was extremely nice, the staff friendly and attentive. The parmesian and corn Mac and cheese is the best. I think I'll be a regular. You need to try it.
