This is my go to place for a quick bite while at work. The staff is always friendly and the food is fresh. The chicken isn't fatty either which makes the bowls taste delicious. The sauce is a little bit sweeter than most places but none the less still good.

I've been coming to this gym for just over a month or so. The gym itself is fairly maintained and clean. The locker room/restroom could use some work. They have a wide selection of free weights and machines and there is a various age range of the clients who work out here. The one bad thing is the staff, excluding the trainers. I'm sure no one has ever been taught what customer service actually is about. My wife had a mishap with trying to cancel her membership and training sessions. We continued to get the run around by several of the employees who kept saying that the manager would give us a call. After a couple of months of going through this hassle, while still being charged, we went into the business and spoke to Roger. Although they were not able to give us our money back, they gave me a free 3 month membership along with 30 training sessions with a personal trainer, and they actually closed her membership. I would say they did their best to make the situation better. This might sound stupid or dumb but I'm actually thinking about opening a membership here just because the layout and equipment is the right fit for me. If you chose to open a membership just make sure when you want to cancel it you do it in writing! I hope this review helps... By the way if you are looking for personal training, Dylon, one of the trainers here, will get you the results you are looking for.

Best selection of beer with the best bartenders in town. Great place just to hang out with friends. And the food is great too!! Probably the best crust and toppings in the north valley. If I could only get them to deliver to my house I would make it a ten star restaurant.

The service has always been spot on here. They treat their customers with a smile and your waiter is basically waiting on you hand and foot.  Their food is also quite well. I really enjoy their pizzas, of course, which guy doesn't like pizza!  My favorite part is the soft and chewy crust.   Definitely try Twisted Italian! You will not be disappointed.   Ps. They also have Groupons which come in handy in a pinch!

Well what can say, Smashburger, you have been able to make a normal hamburger spectacular. I love the create your own option so I can decide what I want for day. My only complaint is that I always order Ranch to be put on burger and yet you fail every time to put it on. You have no issues with the Ketchup or Mustard but for some reason you chose to ignore the added request. Other than that I enjoy the food and will continue to come back and back again.

I came here with a group of friends for a going away party. I will say I was not impressed with the service at all. The drinks were ordered before we ordered for food and we almost got the good before the drinks.  We continued our night here and the service continued to get worse and worse as we ordered more good and drinks. I will definitely not be back here again.

I think the food is good. It's nothing to rave about but it's still good enough to keep me coming back. The staff is friendly and they have excellent service. This is one of the only Breakfast places in the area, besides IHOP and Denny's. I fall in love with their jams!!! They are freaking amazing!!!

If you love a local hang out spot this is the place! They have great good and the atmosphere is spot on. The staff is wonderful   And friendly. The bar is kind of small but don't let that be a factor for the amount of fun you will have. Wall to wall TV's make it a perfect spot for football fans!!! Come out and have fun at this amazing bar and grill!!

I love the whole fact that I can create my own pizza with whatever toppings I want while also being able to choose the different types of crust.   If I'm not in the mood to create my own my go to items are the Artichoke Chicken Thin Crust or the Stuffed 5-Meat! Both of them I enjoy thoroughly. And then to top it off they have delicious desert pizzas. I love the Cinnamon Wheel but they also have a S'mores one too and Cheesey Bread.   The staff at this store is very friendly and treat you with the best customer service, even opening the door for you when your hands are full carrying out the handmade deliciousness.   The other part I love about Papa Murphy's is that it is also baked to perfection! Only because you get to take it home and bake it yourself! Lol.

One of the best family owned, small business, restaurants in the area. The owners and family are very welcoming and the customer service is right on par with their amazing flavorful food.   There is a wide selection of different types of food. From a gyro to chicken and hummus to a great classic "Chicago" Hot dog, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. The food always seems fresh and the pita bread is soft, warm, and delightful. The price is spot on too!   Come and enjoy this place. You will not be disappointed.
