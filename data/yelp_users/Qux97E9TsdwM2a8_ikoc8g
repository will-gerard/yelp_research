Amazing food. Sooo good. Love the hummus and chicken. And the baba ghanoush. OMG.  Decent service. Nothing over the top, but as expected for a small casual place like this. Personally, I find the booths a bit uncomfortable. If I lived closer I'd definitely just get the food to go instead.

It was the first time we had been to the patio in a while and it didn't disappoint on a Saturday night.   Ah-ma-zing service. Seriously!   I had a filet and the brussel sprouts (nom nom!)  which were super good and my husband made me very envious with the short rib pasta. He said it might just be one of the best things he ever ate. That good. I'm getting it next time for sure.   Didn't love the berry cosmo (too sweet!) but the server replaced it immediately with something else.

Best Vietnamese food in town. The pho is incredible. Always busy, but quick and efficient service.

Honestly, their yogurt always tastes heavy and overly sweet to me. I wish they would have some more fruity / tart flavors. More comfortable seating would be a plus as well. Nice location - but at this point we'll drive a little farther west over to Ocean Blue or Zoyo.

Service. Awful and slow.  Food. Mediocre.  Pies. Good. Get them to go.

I work in the Biltmore area, and this has become my go-to for lunch. Seriously! Their deli is just fantastic - the turkey/bacon/avocado sandwich is really, really good. They also make panini's and other sandwiches to order. Nice topping choices on the sandwich bar from the traditional lettuce/tomato to the slightly more exotic like marinated fresh mozzarella and artichoke hearts. Also, use your club card and buy 7 sandwiches and you'll get one free. There's also a Starbucks right there in the store so you can get your latte on. One star off because the parking can be kind of limited at noon (apparently other people like the deli too.)

This is still my (and just about everyone in my office's) go-to for lunch. The sandwiches are awesome (try the paninis) as are the salads that are made to order. They've added freshly made sushi, and it's pretty good too.   Special shout out to the great women working at the sandwich counter just about every day and Richard, who is usually working the express register. Super nice people and great service every time.   Quick, yummy, and not to expensive - what's not to like?

Love this place - I go here for lunch at least once a week. Efficient, affordable and it's not too much of a pain to park (now keep in mind that I'm speaking in relative terms because this is Camelback.)   Love the chicken bowls and the arizona bowl. An extra star because they have REAL brewed iced tea.   Also - love the fact that they write your number on your cup and bring the food to you. So much nicer than waiting to hear your number called, etc.   Pleasant service always.

Yum! Love their chicken philly sandwich and the goat cheese appetizer. The green chile mac and cheese is the bomb!  Fun atmosphere - love the music and decor. Sometimes the service is a bit less attentive then it should be - not bad, but it could use a bit more finesse.

The food was decent. Not "omg best Thai food I've ever had" - but decent quality standard American restaurant Thai food.  Sadly, the service was horrible. Really, really bad.   When we arrived, the teenage girl working the cash register looked at us when we said that we had a party of 2 and looked back at the half empty restaurant and said "oh, you have to have a reservation" - WTF? "Oh, just kidding."   Um, gotta work on your delivery hon, because it wasn't funny.   Then we sat. 10 minutes later she strolled by and took our drink order. Then she came back to take our food order (no, we didn't have our drinks yet.) 10 minutes after that we got our iced teas. Much later we got our food slammed down on our table  (literally) by the other waitress. They never, ever checked back with us - if they had, they would have learned that my husband's food was made spicy, mine wasn't - which was the reverse of what we had asked for. Never cleared our plates. We had to ask for our check after we had been done (with dirty plates sitting in front of us) forever.   Mind you, this was in a half empty restaurant.  Lame. You clearly have untrained servers who either don't care what they are doing or just don't know the basics of food service.   Get some servers who have a clue - waiting tables is a pretty simple process and there are basic steps to it. Greet, take drink order, serve drink order, take food order, deliver food, check back to see if everything is ok, keep an eye on the table to see when they are done, clear plates and offer dessert, bring check, take money. See? Not hard.

Blech. I was running an errand during lunchtime and decided to run through their drive through to pick up a quick bite to eat - I had heard that the food was good from friends. Uncharacteristically, I ordered the chicken strips, fries and an iced tea. The chicken, while crispy, had no flavor in the breading except for an overwhelming amount of salt. The chicken was juicy with a chemically tinged juice. And worst of all, they were cold in the middle. I ate one bite, took a second and literally had to spit it out. Disgusting.  The fries were oversalted and greasy. Nice crunch though. Finished maybe 1/4 of them before I just couldn't eat anymore.   Iced tea was good, but all of the ice was melted by the time I had taken 2 sips. Note to staff - real brewed iced tea is awesome, but it is warm, so you need to fill the cup ALL the way with ice.   Never again. Ick ick ick.

I pulled up to the drive through today and there was not a single customer inside. Proceeded to order 3 sandwiches. Time: 2:44. At 3:11 the person behind us in the drive through asked us to pull forward so that she could bail - apparently didn't have 30 minutes to wait for a smoothie - told us that she tried calling into the store and they hung up on her. We pulled forward to clear the lane and went inside to get the sandwiches and the person working was rude - not at ALL apologetic - dropped the food in the bag on the counter and said "here you go." We then asked for the managers contact info and they refused to provide it. Got in the car and realized that they had failed to give us a receipt so we went back in to get it. Absurd. Management - you need to look into this. Check #7812. Employee named in receipt: Cassidy  Edited to add: Once we got home we realized they had given us the wrong chips and the Steak Tzatziki Flatbread was missing....wait for it....tzatziki. Nice.

This is definitely my favorite of the east valley yogurt shops. I love their tart, orange, and pineapple flavors, and the fruit always looks great to toss on top. Yum - just wish it was closer to my house.

Having a long commute on the 202, I end up getting my windshield replaced about 3 to 4 times a year thanks to all of the gravel on our roads (and careless gravel truck operators!)   I've used Safelite the last 4 times my windshield has been replaced, they almost always are able to come within 48 hours, they come to my work, they call me in the morning to let me know what time they plan to arrive - and then, they actually show up at that time (!!!)   Each tech I've dealt with has been really professional and pleasant.   Oh - and I've NEVER gotten a random call from them asking if I need a new windshield! Because companies who do that, guarantee that I will never ever do business with them again (looking at you Auto Glass Shop!)  Keep up the good work Safelite!

Best. Bartender. Ever.   Seriously - great drinks, friendly and an interesting guy. Find out what he's got infusing behind the bar and get that!  Sat at the bar and had the sliders. Very yummy. The antipasto plate is also really good. Nice snacky food if you aren't up to the whole full blown meal experience.

RUN away and whatever you do don't give these jerks your phone number. They will call - over and over and over. At one point I told the guy calling, "hey, I've asked to be removed from your database, why are you still calling me?" His (snarky) response - "Oh, how's that working for you?"  RUNNNNNN.  Update 06/2016: they still call all the time. Today's call was from 480-750-0058. Stop. Calling. Me.

This is my favorite of the yogurt places in Mesa. Nice combination of flavors, the yogurts aren't overly sweet, and a great selection of toppings. I also like the layout a lot - especially the two sided topping bar - doesn't seem to get as bottlenecked as some other places. The patio outside and garage door adds to the atmosphere.

Perfect brow wax, every time. Super nice techs (Jackie is awesome!) Incredibly clean. Never have to wait more than a minute or two when I arrive. Pretty easy to get an appointment. Totally recommend!

Love this place. We've been here 6-8 times now and each time the food has been outstanding. The teenager loves the Arizona burger (Habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo and fresh jalapeños on a spicy chipotle bun.) I've tried the Classic (which is perfect!) and my newest favorite is the crispy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. Smashfries (1/2 sweet potato and 1/2 regular potato) are addicting. The only downside to this place is that I wish is was just a touch bigger - seating can sometimes be limited. Great service too!

They're slipping. We got takeout last night and first they tried to give us our order (4 burgers, 3 fries) with only one burger and two fries. Then, they tried to give it us with 2 burgers and 3 fries. Then - seriously - they tried again to give it to us missing the two burgers. Jeez. It's not that complicated.   Once we got home (a 3 minute drive) we realized all of the fries were super cold and stale. The burgers had apparently been SmashWrapped© - the 2 guys in the kitchen really need to take it just a bit easier when wrapping the burgers up so that they don't destroy them. And my swiss mushroom truffle burger was super light on the truffle mayo - couldn't even taste it.   So - I guess next time we'll eat in. At least the food won't be cold and mishandled - and if it is, we'll have immediate recourse.

OMG. Just realized that Capriotti's delivers to my Camelback office. Happy happy joy joy!   Delivery was quick and priced right. The Bobby was awesome (as always - best. sammich. ever!) and I really enjoyed the brownie.

I lived in Bangkok for a couple of years and this is the real deal. Excellent food, super fresh veggies, attentive service. Inconsistent spice levels and I'd love more fresh herbs -I ask for it hot and it's not - dining companion asks for mild and it's Issan hot.   I wish they would lose the lame Thai soft rock though - I don't like Air Supply-esque music in any language.

Yuck. I got the thai red chili bowl - horrible. Gummy rice, over salted and nothing thai about it. Additionally the crap Lipton iced tea was just awful. Husband got the Singapore cashew chicke which seemed marginally better - but I think the sauce was just pure hoisin sauce. Just don't eat here.

Nope.   Totally underwhelming and bland tacos. Bland and kind of weird beans (almost a fluffy texture - not what I expect from beans.)   Decent service and a plus for having real iced tea. But those don't make up for the yuck food. Go elsewhere.

Excellent! After having 2 minor chips in the hood of my brand new car (thanks a lot ADOT and the 202 construction contractors - grrrr!) I brought my vehicle into Smartfilm to have paint protection film applied to the front end. It is virtually invisible, looks great and the price was the most reasonable that I could find (and half the cost of the dealer.)   Super nice guys running this place! Strongly recommended!

Freedom Auto Glass telemarketed to me today with a robo call even though I am on the do not call list nor have I ever given them my cell phone number.   Proceed with caution as companies that market in unethical ways that are disrespectful of potential customers privacy are not someone you really want to do business with.

Oh Echo 5. I do want to like you. I do want you to succeed.   But - $9 for potato skins and this is all you get? They were tasty....but $9? For 4 halves? Really? That's all?  The service - it's ok, but not fabulous.  The food is ok - but not great.   And I have to be the person who is all whiny and "but I miss something from the oooolllldddd menu" - but - dangit, I really miss the deliciousness of the previous iterations of the Buffalo Chicken Salad that had been in place over the previous 3 or 4 owners. :-( It was so much better.

Awful, awful, awful service. Tables sit dirty forever (gross!) while they make customers wait. Drink orders not taken or refilled. We went there at close to 8pm and the very limited selection of sushi looked *really* old.  I get that they might not want to fill up the belt later in the evening - but if that is the case then come to our table and ask what we would like to eat for crying out loud.  Because we did come there, after all, to eat food.  We left hungry and stopped elsewhere to get some food in the way home.  It appears that front of the house is run by an 18 year old who doesn't have the slightest idea of what she is doing. And she is really rude. Suggest they invest in a real manager.

Good stuff. I've eaten at Rosa's on University for a couple of decades and the "old" Tia Rosa's as well. I'm quite happy with this change to new ownership - same great food (fish tacos! hooray!) and the best beans I've ever had. Seriously. Perfect. Beans. OMG.  We went there mid-week and did have to wait about 15 minutes to be seated - but the hostess was super polite (BIG change from the previous ownership - so rude we stopped going to this location) and explained that it was because they didn't want to slam the wait staff so that they wouldn't provide good service. Fair enough. The hostess also offered us beverages as we waited.   Once we were seated the service was fine. Food took a little bit long - seems the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed - but we were more than happy to kill the time with chips & salsa & the best bean dip ever. No biggie.  So, are they working out the kinks? Sure. Hopefully they'll get totally up to speed by the time snowbird season rolls around. Is the food delicious? Absolutely. Tastes just like the deliciousness of Rosa's on University and it's closer to me. Are drinks yummy? Yes they are. They have Margarita and sangria by the pitcher too. Does the food cost a bit more than I'd like to pay? Well, yeah - but so is every other restaurant too - inflation sucks.  Is the dining room loud? Yep. Especially when so many of the tables have 5 little kids making noise and *not staying seated* (pet peeve.) Because East Mesa demographics. Not the fault of the owners.   They could use better seating in the waiting area though. Hopefully they'll add that on by the time snowbird season rolls around.

Quick lunch on Camelback. The sushi is pretty good and there is enough traffic that it all looks pretty fresh.   Sometimes it can take a few to get a drink and some wasabi (or the check) - wait staff seems a bit disorganized.

Um, edible, barely.  2 chicken breast / rice bowls, 1 orange chicken noodle bowl. Sodas for 3. $31.  Chicken breast was overlooked and dry. Unseasoned except for some very thick and pasty teriyaki sauce spooned over the top (almost tasted like pure hosin sauce.) Orange chicken soggy and underwhelming. Rice was mushy. Veggies were just ok.  Nice decor inside and pleasant service, which is why I didn't give them a 1.

Surprisingly good. Choose your protein, choose your starch, add some veggies and choose a sauce. I had chicken, rice, veggies and green curry sauce - everything was cooked well and tasted very fresh. 5 stars because they have multiple selections of *real* brewed iced tea.  Parking is a pain - as expected on that corner.

Wow! We've been there 3 or 4 times now. The apple fritters are SO good - light, crisp and very tasty. Also really like the lemon filled donuts. The teenager raves about the jelly filled donuts. Everyone working there (looks like a family run biz) is super friendly and personable.   Highly recommended!

I've taken my care there for oil changes and service, and of course, gave them my cell number so that they could reach me and let me know that it was complete. I don't share my cell number with businesses often because I do not want to have sales phone calls - let alone from a company where I have not explicitly opted INTO marketing from them.   Apparently, they are in the business of sharing those personal phone numbers of people in their database with not only their sales team - which has resulted in unwanted, cold sales calls from their salespeople trying to make their numbers - but repeated phone calls from a warranty company (that somehow happens to know the details of my vehicle and my cell number) trying to sell me some extended warranty. The company they sold my information to is "Vehicle Company Processing" and it is based out of Compton, CA - and if you google the company you'll see that it is clearly a scam.  I'll never buy a car from them now. I won't get my car serviced there again. Just because they don't value the privacy of my own information. Totally unethical, and really, really poor marketing practices.

Here it is - a year later and their dealership car salespeople have called me again - I didn't opt into having them call me, I took my car in for service. What an awful marketing practice and a sure way to alienate potential customers!   Just because I gave them my # to let me know when my oil change was done *DOES NOT* mean that I opted into having their salespeople calling me on the phone - besides, I'm pretty darn happy with my 2015 Mazda 6 (I'll never buy another Chrysler - but that's a whole other review!)  I'd suggest proceeding with caution as companies that market in unethical ways and that are disrespectful of potential customers privacy are not someone you really want to do business with.
