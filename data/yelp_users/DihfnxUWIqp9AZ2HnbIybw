Their miso soup was cold and SPOILED. They made us another batch that was actually hot and no longer tasted a few days old, but still nasty. Their teriyaki chicken was also salty.

While I knew of Penn and Teller, I had not seen any of their shows, in person or on TV. I loved every minute of their performance last night. They had me laughing most of the time, and their tricks were amazing. Thought it was a very nice touch that they took selfies and signed autographs at the end of their show.  Tip: I was able to purchase our seats at a discount through Travelzoo.

Best dish of the night was their shrimp and corn tamale. Shrimp was cooked to perfection, and the sauce was just fantastic. My sixteen spice chicken was also delicious.  Mesa Grill was not kid friendly, but I should've known that. They don't really make adjustments to their dishes (less spicy, for example). Our waiter recommended the quesadilla for my 2 year old, but it was still too spicy for him. The adults had no problem devouring it though.  Had to take away one star because I did not care for their signature pork tenderloin at all.

4 stars because their pork chop was fantastic. Unlike most pork chops I've had that tend to be a little dry, the one at Wolfgang's was juicy and flavorful. Their tartare was another highlight. Their pasta dishes fell short, however - salty and mediocre. Pizza was decent, but soggy in the middle.

Yum, yum, yum! Delicious gelato. Lots of good flavors to choose from, but a little pricey. Gelato was more ice cream-like in texture- not as dense, more airy. (Not that that's a bad thing.)
