This is literally the worst dining experiences have ever had. Pearl was recommended to us by a few friends n the menu looked pretty good. We stopped in about 6:30 on a Saturday night and were going to have dinner but within the first five minutes of being there changed our plans to drinks and just a roll or two. The reason being two things - the people who were dining there and the service.   The people at the table next o us had clearly come in much MUCH earlier in the day or "all day happy hour" and were feeling the effects. They probably should have been cut off but were still going, much to the dismay of the rest of the diners.  Then the service. Really so many issues here, first, the host greeting us and then just walking away from us, I assumed she was taking us to our table, but she didn't communicate that and stopped to chat with some f the servers while we awkwardly stood behind her. Then she snapped when we didn't follow her as she started walking again. It took us forever to get drinks once at our table,and once we did order we watched the sit at the bar or at least 20 minutes because our server didn't pick them up. It wasn't because she was slammed either, we watched her chatting with the other waitstaff,nine if whom could've bothered with their tables. We also were witness to the host going off about giving her two weeks notice and how much she hated this place, that explains her attitude. On top of all of this there was no manager at all, makes sens why there was such bad service. From reading other reviews it doesn't seem like our experience was all that unique, it seems like the people who OMG LOOOOVE this place love that they can get drunk on the cheap. If you want Anything beyond a failing bar with mediocre food I'd go elsewhere.

This space made me fall in love with Madison. We came on a Friday afternoon in early summer. Bands playing, beer trucks, fresh fish tacos, sitting on the dock - does life get better? If winter wasn't so dang cold in Madison I would move in a heartbeat.

Yum-o! After seeing Matt's on triple D I knew that we would have to hit it up on our trip to Phoenix, and it did not disappoint. We arrived at about 10:30 on a Friday morning and waited for about 10 minutes before getting seated at the bar. I started with the OJ, my husband got the strawberry honey lemonade, both were amazing! For breakfast I did the omelette with cheddar cheese and bacon, husband got the eggs and sausage patties. There is an up charge for the bacon in my omelette but it was totally worth it, there was tons of delicious bacon in my omelette. The highlight if the meal was he amazing sourdough toast and jam. If I hadn't been so full of bacon I would have gotten an extra side of toast - so good!  I wish we lived in Phoenix so we could go back!
