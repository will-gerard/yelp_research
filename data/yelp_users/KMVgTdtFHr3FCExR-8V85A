Fries had no salt and undercooked. Tzsaziki sauce was not good at all. The combo chicken and beef plate was also undercooked. I was so disappointed!! Charred on the outside and raw on the inside?!

Best gyro and fries I've had in a long time! 5star quality all around! The fries were perfectly crisp, the tsaziki sauce was perfectly seasoned! And the gyro was cooked just right! I will definitely be a returning customer! Thanks for the great customer service!

Lashitup has the best quality lashes I've come across! Great experience! My lashes look amazing and I know I'll keep wanting to go back for more :) Amida is amazing with timing and styling the lashes. My lashes always look fantastic!!! The best part about it is, no more mascara, ever!!!
