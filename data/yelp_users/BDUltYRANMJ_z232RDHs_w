The worst out there, they just want your money. They don't care for cars, or car owners they only pretend! I wish I believed other people's bad reviews.

Love this place, love the food as well. Staff is very nice, talked to the manager, he's a very cool person as well.

Very disappointed at service, very unprofessional. couldn't even order food due to a rude cashier lady. Asked to speak to a manager but he cared less either and never came out to talk. I'm surprised on how they have a business going with no clue how to run a business!!
