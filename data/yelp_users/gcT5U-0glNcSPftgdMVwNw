The man who served me did not make eye contact and was not friendly. If you're looking for good customer service I do not recommend this subway. I would drive the extra mile to go somewhere else.

I've been to Sushi Roku a handful of times and I LOVE IT! The restaurant is stunning, the staff is extremely friendly, and the food is absolutely delicious. The manager is AWESOME as well. I recommend this place to all of my friends and family.

I had a GREAT experience at Go Paddle AZ! The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable. I was with the Lululemon SUP and it was such a great event. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something fun to do with your friends/family/loved ones and even your dog!
