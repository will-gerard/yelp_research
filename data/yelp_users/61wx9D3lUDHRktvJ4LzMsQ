The tantan men soup was spicy and delicious! My friend and I split the huge portion and an order of the Alaska rolls = also very good!

I live within walking distance and find myself here a couple times a month! I keep my hot dog basic (ketchup & red onion) but the chili dog is good, too. Yummy French fries.

Went here for brunch and had their salmon eggs Benedict...they were awesome! Ordered a cherry almond coke, which was also crazy delicious. Lots of other yum looking stuff on their menu.

Can I give zero stars? Every. Single. Time. We go here (whether it's drive thru or walk in) ...they get my order wrong. I hate mustard and I hate pickles. Guess what? My burger is slopped with both things each time. The service is typically rude, like I'm bothering them. There is one tall, thin brunette guy (looks 17-19) that is always very nice. But that's about it.

Hula's is a cool, not too cheesy, tiki bar in central Phoenix. I like it because it's right off the light rail, only a short ride from my house. Usually sit on the outside patio, which faces Central. Haven't really tried much of the food, calamari was pretty good and been told that their burgers are delish. The best part of Hula's is their Tiki Time happy hour, weekdays 330-6 and all day on the weekends! I'm not usually a Mai tai fan, but theirs are reeeally good.  They have brunch specials on the weekends, haven't tried that out yet but need to soon...  I'm always on the prowl for a mimosa!! Overall, I really dig this place. Chill and a great happy hour!

I love this place! Great sammies... I especially love The Bobbie. It's like a thanksgiving leftover sandwich...yum!
