This place had a great vibe. Small, relaxed and welcoming. I really liked the set up of this place. It was comforting and cozy. We ordered the sampler and were content. The Stout really stood out. I wish they bottled. Well next time in AZ for Spring Training.

Las Vegas Brewery Stop #2  No food, just beer...the way I like it. Focus. Too many places try to do it all.  Sampler:  Pilsner Hefeweizen Calico Brown Ale Hop Ride IPA - A beautifully hopped beer Seasonal: Summer Sunrise Kolsch Seasonal: Moonsoon - DIPA Seasonal: Oktoberfest  Everything was incredibly balanced. The Hop Ride IPA was delicious, defiantly West Coast style. The Calico Brown was really interesting...there was just something about it that made me want to get to know it better. If you wanted to try something new their guest tap included Lagunitas, Deschutes, Dogfish....really impressed.   This was probably my favorite brewery in Vegas. Thank you Tenaya for your delicious beers and for investing in a bottling line for us out of towners.

Las Vegas Brewery Stop #1  24 hour brewery....I like it. The draft house is in North West Vegas, shaped as a big barn with cow statutes out front.  We ordered a sampler and were surprised by the quality. There is defiantly a stigma to beer brewed in Vegas. Normally craft beer isn't cheaper than anything Anheuser...basically get off the strip for a good beer at a fair price. We enjoyed there:  Leglifter Light Tailwagger Wheat Holy Cow! Original Pale Ale Red Hydrant Ale 38 Special (blend of Holy Cow & Red Hydrant) Black Lab Stout Dirty Dog IPA Seasonal: Pumpkin Ale  Pale, Red Hydrant, and IPA took it. Good quality. Nice service and a good vibe. Big Dog's is a packer hangout with memorabilia all over the walls. Good first stop.

After years of dreaming we finally made it to spring training and most importantly Scottsdale Stadium, home of the SF Giants. The stadium has an incredible location right in Old Town Scottsdale. Surrounded by restaurants, bars, gift shops and galleries. The stadium can seat 12,000, but feels small enough because you can see and interact with the players. (We got Brandon Crawford, Hector Sanchez and Will the Thrill's signature!)  The lawn has lots of trees, therefore shade...unlike a lot of stadiums.  Also along the third base line they have an area that's $25 with tables, chairs, unlimited food (hotdogs, burgers, pasta) and 1 beer. Well worth it and a lot less crowded then the lawn.  Gates open 2 hours prior and the gift shop opens in the morning. Parking was really easy. I was intimidated by all the reviews.   Agree with Paul V. that the stadium is second only to Talking Sticks, which feels more like a big league park. Can't beat the location and of course the Giants fans.  It s a funny feeling meeting basically your neighbors, but in AZ.

Even if they don't brew there own beer this place is amazing. Great tap list, but it's the multiple fridges that keep you coming. So many beers that we don't get in the Bay Area! You can order from the bar or grab a beer from the fridge. All the severs knew there stuff and were eager to teach. So my place. The pizza was great and we would defiantly come again next time we are in AZ.

Out of all the Arizona breweries this was first on our list from recommendations. Spring training was just the chance. We went for brunch There is just something about ordering eggs benedict and a sampler. Eggs benedict was good, but the sampler was better. The standouts were the Hefeweizen, Hop Knot IPA and the Porter.  The brewpub is huge basically wrapped around their production facility. Nothing like drinking next to the kettles. Service could have been better, not bad just not personal. There social media presence is wonderful. So refreshing and exciting to see.

I have never had a bad experiences here so far, even having been delayed on multiple flights. The staff for the most part is friendly. The security never takes too long. There are restaurants as well as fast food, which allows choice.   Basically anytime I'm leaving Vegas...I am too tired to be agitated.

Brewery and Casino? Never heard anything like it before....only in Vegas. Its located a block from the strip (vegas block not city block...its a walk)   Brewery: This place is all about the price. $2 craft beer in a 20 oz pilsner glass. This place is a gem when a deal in vegas is $1.50 budweiser bottles. This is CRAFT BEER. Well...none of the beers blew me away, but I still support breweries every time. Their Stout and Hef is worth trying though. They also make a Lager, Golden, and Amber Ale. Nothing too aggressive, which I miss from Northern California Beers.   Casino: Old school feel with a mix of new and old slot machines, $5 table games with really nice dealers. Lots of TV's for watching the game. Place where the locals and taxi drivers hangout.   Restaurant: Cheap, cheap, cheap...prices range from $3.99 to $15ish. Good food for the price. Patty was our server for a group of 11 and she was so friendly. Way to take care of us in hangover mode.

My parents always left my brother and I to the strip in Vegas.....before we were 21.  Therefore, we hung out a lot at the M & M's World. Its amazing how many M&M "stuff" there is.   Best part is the mix and match area...you can help yourself to a variety of colors.

This place is horrible. Its one of those places that you think could be fun because of the movie. The idea is good, but the only people dancing on the bars our the audience. You can't just have your patrons dance. Something professional would be nice.

As my first Cirque du Soleil show. It was kind of disappointing.   The show really needed a storyline. Annoying baby and a wondering snail just doesn't due it.   I kept asking everyone else if their other shows were like this. The others are better. Pay the extra money.

Came for Halloween weekend. It was our first time here and we were with some friends who had bottle service. We were very well taken care of but always with a price (thankfully not us). Your glass was never empty and they freshened the table every 20 minutes it seemed. This place was great for people watching. We were up top overlooking the bar. Only thing I would change is the size of the dance floor, not too big especially for how many people were there. All in all great night.

This place just didn't do it for me. We ate at the restaurant...forgettable and went to a music venue. The venue was just small...most clubs are bigger than this.

Went to Maggiano's on Sunday night for surprise engagement dinner. We were a group of 11 and only had to wait around 20 minutes. We were able to share a bottle of prosecco at the bar during the wait. We were told our table was ready and they led us into the wine cellar. I was so excited to be in a private room with dimmed lighting.  From dinner we ordered the Classic family style and were given the choices of two appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees and desserts. The food doesn't stop. The only hard part was agreeing on what to order.   Appetizers: Calamari Fritt√© and Bruschetta.  Salads: Ceasar and Chopped. Pastas: Mom's Lasagna and Chicken & Truffle Tortellacci  Entrees: Chicken Saltimbocca and Eggplant Parmesan Desserts: Creme Brulee and Chocolate Zuccotto Cake   My favorites were the Chopped Salad, love blue cheese! Chicken & Truffle Tortellacci was the most interesting flavors and the Eggplant Parmesan had the perfect breaded textured and eggplant was cooked just right. Creme Brulee was fantastic and huge, but by that point we were so full. I would also recommend the Chianti Castello di Querceto. Went really well with the Mom's Lasagna.  Ryan was our server and he was fantastic. Very attentive and helpful. They even brought in two older men who played guitar and violin and had us do our first dance. The night was great. Thank you Maggiano's and Ryan!

I was pleasantly surprised by this cafe. I went for breakfast and didn't have any high hopes. Thought it would be another buffet style. This was probably one of the first meals where I actually felt satisfied by the taste and money I was spending. Typical Vegas prices $10-15 meals. We both had omelets and the hash browns were great, so textured. Danny was our server and he was very nice and attentive.

Las Vegas Brewery Stop #4  Triple 7 Brewery is located in Main Street Station Casino in Downtown Vegas. It was a nice chance to visit that area again. Much more going on then I remember in years past. We sampled their:  Royal Red Lager Marker Pale Ale High Roller Gold Blackchip Porter Brewers Special...I believe was a Pumpkin Spice Ale  The names were cute, first brewery to really have vegas or gambling names, which surprised us. The beers were good...seemed like they tried to make lots of different styles including a Belgian quadruple, which we didn't get to try. The brewpub was a nice change because it was dedicated a area to beer and food and didn't have video poker at every table. Great place to watch sports with a large group. We defiantly try again.

I wanted to love this place, but I just didn't feel good after eating here. I ordered the Napa burger and I couldn't even eat 1/3 of it. I'm not sure...it wasn't horrible, but did not make my stomach feel good.   Also the beer just wasn't there. Yes, there is a lot of beer on tap but no one knew anything about the beer that was brewed their. I order the Pub IPA  and my friend ordered the Tenaya Creek IPA and it could have been the same beer...I really think it was. I know Tenaya Creek brews their beer, but usually they impart a little different style. Also it tasted like a carmel bar...way to thick.  Always be suspicious of menu's with no drink prices. We got the bill and the beer was between $10-$13 dollars a pint...not a 20 oz....a pint!  I was blown away.  My beer cost the same as my damn burger.   Tip: If you are looking for craft beer head to Ellis Island Brewery $2 for a 20 oz.

Fremont Street is something to at least do once. You are in the old part of Vegas with cheap drinks and table games.   Lots of celebrity impersonators and great people watching.   Light show is great, changes pretty often.

"Cliche can be FUN..." Sharon T. is right.  I saw this show before I was 21 and it was the highlight of the trip. You are assigned a country and you sit in the area and cheer and cheer for them. We sat in Ireland and they actually won.   You also get dinner and its all about the hands. Nothing but your fingers and darkness. The soup was wonderful and the chicken was forgettable, but the whole experience was great.

One of my favorite places to attend in Vegas! I was so excited to go back this round and it was just as good! Located within the Paris hotel. This place is always packed and worth it! Almost cheesy at first, but you can't help but get involved. The dueling pianos are great and they are very talented. The crowd is always mixed and people willing to throw down money to get their songs played. Don't drop anything but a $20 or it won't get played. The mixed drinks are around $10.   After looking on the website they claim to have 100 different types of Champagne. I can't believe I didn't know about this? Not one waitress said anything and no one around my was drinking Champagne. Also, its a cigar bar and again not one person was smoking. Maybe this was just a rare occurance each time I come.   So so so much fun though!

I was very excited to visit on my trip to Vegas. I had planned on visiting a few breweries and this was one of the few on the strip. They have multiple locations along the strip. I went to the Miracle Mile Shops and was very excited to try them. I tried the Weiss, which was my least favorite..I just didn't get much complexity from it. The amber was better, but still didn't excite me. The stout was defiantly their best beer because it was rich in taste and body. I didn't get to try their Blonde.  I was disappointed that I wasn't really able to talk about the beers and their style. This is the main reason I love microbreweries, you get to see and taste their passion. I probably had too high of hopes for a brewery on the strip. Makes sense why their was so much merchandise and no one too talk to. Next time I will go earlier in the afternoon. I will revisit them again next time I am in Vegas and don't have to compete with people just trying to get trashed.

Kiosk style multi tap bar/area. Its a nice place to walk up and grap a beer. Whats nice is that a lot of the beer is craft. Way better than $8 Budweiser around the corner.   Very convenient stopping point, no real vibe.

How is there only 3 reviews?  We stayed at the Tropicana because the rest of our group was staying here. The place is small, but still on the strip. Probably one of the cheapest on the strip and you can tell in every corner. They are currently under a remodel and have signs everywhere including the rooms what they new ones are going to look like. This is very depressing when you are still staying in our beat down rooms. The sink constantly dripped with water no matter what you did. The sliding door barely closed, which kind of freaked me out the whole time. But the worst part was the beds. I usually can sleep on anything and be perfectly fine, but these beds hurt so badly. After two nights sleeping on them I still have a swore neck now that I'm home.   The only thing I like was the pool. Pretty big pool with lots of shade in areas. There was even two blackjack tables in the pool to play. My friend rented the party cabana for $250 and it was really just some pillars with a sheet over it. It didn't even come with all the necessities and he was still charged the full amount. Would never do that again. Also the waitress was just not very nice for the money we were spending.   There are other places to stay in Vegas around the same price that don't have nearly this many problems.

Camelback Ranch is home to the Dodgers and White Soxs. Easy drive from Scottsdale and free parking! The walk to the stadium is beautiful with curving paths around flowing water and practice fields all around. The stadium is very open and spacious. Did I mention clean? Everything in AZ felt so clean. Not sure if it was just me.  Food selection was great...you can get a Dodger dog and a Chicago style dog and there was AZ craft beer! Finally! The other stadiums need to step it up.  Great stadium to watch a game on a sunny day.

How are their harsh reviews? The show is amazing and stops you every time you are walking the strip. It's also free. Stop and relax for a bit.

Hash House A Go Go is completely Vegas.  Everything is bigger and better and visually stimulating. The portions are beyond big...they are massive. The restaurant is on its own floor. The place is always packed and you wait and wait for your food. We probably waited over an hour for a single dish....but at least the Bloody Marys are wonderful. Bacon sea salt on the rim is fantastic!   Service was horrible. They exhumed bitchiness. It really didn't kill the experience though. The food was what it was about here.   We ordered the Smoked Salmon Farm Benedict. Its starts with grilled mash potatoes, an amazingly soft and yet crunchy biscuit, shredded salmon, crushed red peppers, spinach, and two eggs. All covered in chili cream sauce and asparagus spears. We couldn't even eat half of it.   Vegas and gluttony at its finest.

Came here for drinks and to check out the civic center. I had a wonderful time here. Our waitress was adorable and really nice. Their drink menu had so many options and around 50 beers on tap. Even some local craft beers. You could get beers in pints, yards and pitchers. Also in flights of four! I had the Tenaya Creek Pilsner, a local Vegas brewery. Interesting flavors, very earthy and well balanced.   Their menu also looked great, but we were so full from another restaurant. They also give free pints if you can finish them in 7 seconds. Pretty entertaining. Thought their cocktails were great, which included a 24 ounce Pabst and a shot of Jack Daniels. Pretty great. Will be back again.

I know that most airline reviews are usually negative, but US Airways don't even try to improve their service. I choose them because they were the cheapest price between Las Vegas and San Francisco. From now on I will pay the extra $20 dollars. We got to our gate with plenty of time and the representative told us the plane was going to arrive early. With 5 minutes before we were supposed to take off the plane had still not arrived. It took another 30 minutes for people to get off the plane and then another 30 minutes to board the plane. The reason for this is that the plane is tiny and they can't even accommodate carry-on's. The problem: they don't tell you this til your boarding. With one representative tagging each bag. When we get off the plane they just dump all the bags in the tunnel and its a free for all. Completely unorganized. Not worth the cheaper flight. Also no room on board and pissy flight attendants.

Located within the Tropicana. South Beach Cafe & Deli is open 24 hours serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This was very convenient when we were returning to our hotel at 4 in the morning. Prices were not to bad, average $10-12 meals and lots of snacks. Would recommend for late night snacks on the strip.

What a park! It could be a big league park. So spacious and clean.  Easy parking. I think it was $5 and there are people in golf carts carrying you back and forth. Everyone was really kind. We sat in the lawn and it was huge. You could arrive after the first pitch and still have room. The angled it perfectly, everywhere you could see.  Also, I was highly impressed with the presence of Diamondback players signing autographs and interacting with fans. (Giants really need to step up) If you are going to Spring Training make sure to see this field.
