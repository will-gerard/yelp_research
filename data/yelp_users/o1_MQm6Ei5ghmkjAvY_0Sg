not good. i went on a wednesday, during lunch, when school was in session. i ordered the roasted red pepper and brie sandwich which was served on a baguette. they had no baguettes, and no brie. they also had no coleslaw which is served on many sandwiches. the prices on the menu were different (and higher) than their menu online. i paid $9.02 for a bad sandwich and a drink. it did come with a bag of lays potato chips. if you want to upgrade your chips to anything else, be prepared to pay 75 cents more.   i only went because i was in a class in the mercado which is where this sandwich shop is located. i will not be going back.

had a fantastic/delicious experience at zinc. i went with a friend for lunch, we were seated promptly and our charming and downright adorable server, aubrey, was helpful and wonderful. she made great wine pairing suggestions and made the experience delightful.  as a non-meat eater, i had to be choosy, but the kitchen seemed accommodating and everything was divine. down to the last bite of two mouth-watering desserts.

i work really close to this place, so it's ultra convenient. but i reserve it in case of emergency only.   the veggie sandwich i first receive was the topping for a burger: lettuce, tomato and onion on bread. that was it. i realized this before paying and asked for some extra veggies, a slice of cheese and some mustard. talk about not delish. but it filled the hole.  they also just started this second counter inside the deli called the inner grill. grilled sandwiches, smaller portions and cheaper prices. i got the caprese: mozzerella, pesto and tomato on baguette, grilled. usually simple and good. this time? not so much. meh.

i've never been upset at haji. never. it's super casual, located inside a middle eastern grocery. the food is fantastic. best falafel in town, hands down. the service is quick and efficient and the same faces have been working there for a long time.   the portions are large, the hummus is great and so is everything else. as a vegetarian, i can't comment on the meat dishes, but my carnivorous friends are never disappointed. me + haji = pure love.

clearly FEZ doesn't need another review, but i wanted to chime in about the veggie burger. i wish i didn't work three minutes from FEZ because when i forget my lunch that's all i can dream about. so, alas, the black bean veggie burger has been consumed more times than should be legal. the burger is sandwiched between a delicious cabbage coleslaw and goat cheese. it can't be the healthiest thing around, but it's certainly one of the most delicious.  the drink specials are phenomenal; just wish i could enjoy a few on my lunch hour! keep up the delicious work, FEZ.

i think this is now operating under the name francis and sons. regardless, you can pay for a better wash, but you'll still only get the basic. then when you go back to ask about the additional services you paid for but didn't get, you'll get glares. save your money, don't go here.

i'm in love with haji baba, so the thought of trying falafel from another middle eastern restaurant felt like cheating. but i'm glad i did. the falafel sandwich from middle eastern bakery and deli was crispy on the outside, warm, soft and flavorful on the inside. the pieces were small, but there were plenty inside the pita. the bread was delicious too. i'm sad that this is located so close to work because i'll be "forgetting" my lunch a lot more often. the prices are slightly higher than haji (i paid $5 and change for the sandwich alone) but it was still a relatively good deal.

the have gluten-free pita. GLUTEN FREE PITA! and it's soft and fluffy and delicious and they won't charge you extra for it. i actually thought they gave me the regular wheat kind the first time i had it because it's so delectable. you can also buy it by the package for something crazy like $4. that's right, i said gluten free.

the sushi was so-so, but the service was slow and the prices were bad. they also were out of soy paper the day i was there which was a let down. there are plenty of other delicious sushi/japanese places in the valley. really no need to go here. also, they serve their edamame cold.

5-star food, 1-star speed. plan to wait for a long time, but it's totally worth it. the food is fresh, healthy and delicious. gluten-free carrot cake pancakes were bomb, but the owner literally had to mill the gf flour. worth it dot com, but it takes awhile. just sayin.

i love this place a lot. but there are a few things you need to know:  1. make a reservation, even if it's tuesday at 5:30 and you're already en route. i've had to wait for a table in the room full of empty tables simply because i didn't call ahead. 2. never pay full price. they always have a groupon, living social, restaurant.com or other coupon available somewhere and paying full price is a little steep. 3. get the garlic naan. each veggie dish i've had i've loved, you can't go wrong. the paneer dishes are rich and delicious and make me fat and happy.

finally got to try this place out! i went for lunch on a friday but arrived early because of warning of slow service. these rumors seem to be true. i ordered the watermelon rosewater beverage which was refreshing and not too sweet, and the goat cheese and red pepper quesadilla which was heavenly. the only problem with it was that it wasn't six times bigger. i seriously considered ordering another. and another. the red peppers are made into a marmalade, so they're sweet; sweet and unbelievably delicious.  i also ordered the eggplant and chick pea salad because they were out of the lentil salad. the dressing was citrusy and light, but there was a little too much of it on the salad. otherwise, it was delightful. a simple salad.   service was friendly, albeit slow, but they easily accommodated my friend who was unable to eat starchy products. they cooked up an off-menu delicious spanish-style vegetable dish with eggs and chorizo. she was smitten.   my only complaint was that it was very, very hot in there. true, it's august, but i was sweaty when i left. and they were all out of dessert which may or may not be a bad thing!

if cute yoga pants are part of your road to enlightenment, you might want to find a different studio. i've been practicing yoga off and on since i was 8 years old. just in the past year or two have i really come to value my practice and the importance of a quality studio. yoga nirvana has a variety of classes, great instructors and a variety of class times. it's hard to find, but it's worth looking for.

i had a couple beers and my bike was recently stolen, so i needed delivery. i shoud have just walked somewhere. this was not good. the falafel looked like little cat turds and didn't taste much better. the fries were ok, but c'mon, they're fries! if you're going to order, have more beers than i did. it might be better that way. they also charge a delivery fee and ask you to prepay tip.

i parked in back and went through the back door which takes you right through the kitchen. a man in back greeted me and escorted me though the kitchen to the counter where a woman greeted me promptly. i orgered the farmer's market wrap with pasta salad and just as i went to pay, spotted a tray of giant chocolate chip cookies looking lonely behind the woman. so i added one of those too. i started eating the cookie while i waited for my lunch. woah, delicious. soft and fresh and loaded with chocolate chunks.   i took my lunch to go and brought it back to work. the wrap was loaded with fresh veggies and a yummy sauce of unknown origin. it was a decent size and being that i had just devoured a cookie nearly the sze of my head, i saved the other half for later. it sat on my desk for a couple of hours and when i bit into the second half, it was surprisingly better than the first. i guess the flavors had time to marinate.   since i work so close to here, i'll be back. i want to try to the hot vegetarian sandwich. and another cookie. who am i kidding?

a hole-in-the-wall joint with a great staff and simple but delicious food. the salsa bar has a fantastic avocado salsa!  great ceviche, and the other items are served in a standard, quick-service mexican style. order at the counter, then take your seat. they have a large selection of bottled mexican beers and mexican-style coca-cola.   this is one of my standbys in maricopa. it definitely beats the other greasy spoon chains.

the name is slightly misleading because they also now serve lunch, which is likely a mistake. we called in an order and i had difficulty finding the place because signage is bad and the location is difficult to find. however when i got there, the staff was very friendly and promptly handed me my order and i was on my way.   when i got back to the office the food was barely warm (i didn't have to go far, but i'll take partial blame for ordering take-out to begin with) which told me it was ready waaaay before they told me it would be.   the fries were flavorless, and my jalapeno chili veg burger was not the least bit spicy. kinda disappointing. it also was supposed to come with some sort of "sunshine" sauce but my order had none while a colleague's did. i was overly underwhelmed.

The black bean veggie burger is probably the most heart un-healthy veggie burger i've ever had, but it was really good. it comes smothered in carmelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, cheese and is apparently cooked on a greasy griddle. i added avocado at my server's recommendation. avocado makes everything better.   i didn't order my own sweet potato fries, but scammed a few from a friend. the garlic aioli served with the fries was divine. i'll be back.

incredible selection of rare beers and microbrews always changing. super laid-back atmosphere where you can hear your friends talk. we wanted to take a couple of bottles to go and the bartender instead brought them up to the counter next door (tops liquor) because it was cheaper to byy from them than the bar side. nice guy. good service, good atmosphere, great beer. what else do you want?

my favorite restaurant in the valley, no questions asked. everything is so carefully prepared, lovingly delivered to your table and so delicious. you can't go wrong, really. eat here. eat everything, eat it all. chef charlene badman has a way with vegetables. it's really pure magic. all my meat-eating companions have nothing but good things to say.   go here. you won't be disappointed.

we need more places like this. whole, healthy foods, gluten free, vegan. yessssss! if you're looking for fries and gigantic, unhealthy portions, look elsewhere. the prices are in line with what you get, which is fresh, delicious, healthy, real food.

i think my lunch salad was made last night, it had no dressing and i waited 25 minutes to be seated. i'm all set. the only neat thing is every dish is under 475 calories. good concept, but it falls short. really, really short.

this place gets a LOT of hype and, unfortunately, doesn't live up to it.   i went for my birthday which was also the start of spring restaurant week. understandably, they were busy. my husband and i arrived early for our reservation, checked in and took a seat at the bar. i ordered a specialty cocktail which was supposed to contain muddled mint and a sugared rim. it arrived with no suragered rim and whole mint leaves. fine. it was still good.  dinner time came and with it being restaurant week, we looked over the menu. had i ordered off the resturant week menu instead of the regular menu, i would have paid more for the three items than had i just ordered straight off the menu. bad form!   so my mother and i both ordered the red pepper cannelloni. my huband ordered the green chili pork (?) off the restaurant week menu and my brother got the barbeque pork. my brother was the only one who liked his food. the green chili was runny/oily and lacked good flavor.  the canneloni had ZERO flavor. amazingly bland vegetables inside an amazingly bland red pepper with an amazingly bland sauce on the side. no good. the server (who was very nice but very rushed and difficult to find) immediately offered to get us something else whcih we appreciated. i got the chopped salad which was fine. nothing special. my mom got the chicken and dumplings - again, lacking any significant flavor. the manager came over, apologized for the cannelloni dishes and said they've been experienceing problems and very mixed reviews on vegetable dishes since they opened. i suggest getting to work on something good containing vgetables. this is NOT going to cut it.  dessert was also ho-hum. the pecan/fig pie had a great filling but a rock solid crust . my husband said the bacon s'mores were too much work - messy and not very good.   overall i'm totally shocked at the good reviews this place continues to receive. i just wasn't at all impressed.

if something on their draft list sounds good, go drink it. NOW. they usually only get one keg of a variety of craft beers, and when they're gone, something else shows up in its place. they have a lot of delicious things on draft, and a selection of delicious beers to go. food is ok but everything has meat in it. even all the salads. boo.

i went to a really nice event put on by slow food phoenix here. the menu was limited that night, so i wanted to come back and try more things. the grounds are so lovely, so my husband and i came back one week later for our 8 year wedding anniversary.  it was a tuesday night and we walked into the main dining room where the bartender and two servers were busily chatting behind the bar. we stood there for a minute not knowing if we were intruding or used the wrong entrance. so i leisurely walked to the back patio and was met by one of the servers (who was previously ignoring us) about a minute later. she then decided to seat us. to our luck, she also was our server.  She forgot a portion of our order, was totally distracted and didn't really pay any attention to us. we had to flag her down to order more drinks. we ordered a cheese plate and some drinks. the cheese was great and the wine was a good value at $3 for a 3 oz. pour. we also ordered some fried polenta which was far too greasy and mostly flavorless. instead of flagging her down again to order entrees, we decided to try out another restaurant for actual dinner. it was really disappointing because i fully support what they are doing - using local ingredients and offering a seasonal menu, it's just that we had a bad experience. i'm not sure i'm willing to try again considering the prices and this experience. i know our server may have just been having an off night - but that's really what can make or break a good meal.

it seriously blows my mind that this place has a 4.5 star average. who is rating this stuff so high?!!  the samosas were served room-temperature, my paneer dish was EXTREMELY greasy, my mango lassi never came, the entire restaurant was out of napkins (not kidding!) and the chicken dishes come with such huge chunks of chicken that there's barely any flavor (so i'm told, i don't eat meat). a highlight was the garlic naan, lowlight, the service. by far. two young women who didn't care the least about good service.  don't waste your time or money. seriously, go up the street to the dhaba. waaaaaay better food and service. a little pricier, but you get what you pay for.

the food is fantastic, fresh and delicious, but what i love most about this place is the contrast between the front of house and back. two conservatively dressed women run the kitchen while a young white guy sings and dances to EDM while taking orders. it's a riot. but back to the food. there are a lot of meat dishes, but dancing guy is super helpful by offering to substitute almost any vegetable or combination of veggies to replace the meat. and it always works. the salads are big and great, wraps are too, and the fries are delightful.

i really loved my falafel pita. i was a little bit skeeeered at first to create my own, ya know, with the classic falafel pita creation being so divine. but i went for it. i added roasted beet hummus, fried eggplant, garlic aioli (put this on everything, please), tatziki and some other goodness. i went there for lunch and seriously though about going back for dinner to try another version. can't wait to go back. solid stuff.
