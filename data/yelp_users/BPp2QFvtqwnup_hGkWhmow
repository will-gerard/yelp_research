It has been awhile since I've been to a Mimi's Cafe. I think it's going to be a long time before I come back. Service was good but the portions, menu, and prices have taken a turn for the worst. Very small OJ to go along with the removal of muffins from the breakfast entrees mean way less for my money. They previously brought a pot for coffee I believe. It's just generally not as good as I remember. Don't waste your time.

Six of us went in for drinks and some late night snacking. We ordered some nachos and they brought complimentary chips and salsa. This was my first time here since re-opening as TQLA.   The first round of drinks was a mess. The server could not get anything right. My beer was wrong TWICE! The bartender apparently mixed the wrong alcohols into two of my friends drinks. The server did not really do a great job of trying to fix the situation. He instead tried to say we were wrong and that the tequila they tasted was in the right drink. That drink was supposed to have mint leaves yet the other drink which didn't have tequila had mint leaves. Wow. Good job buddy. This guy couldn't even remember the four tequilas they had that were infused.   By the way. The infused tequilas are awful. Everyone that tried the vanilla and hibiscus/mint almost vomited. For a bar that names themselves tequila it was a poor showing.   The only bright point was the chips, salsa, and nachos. All were fantastic. I would not recommend this place for drinks or the service. It was awful. Now the food was actually pretty good.   Overall I think this building is cursed because the last restaurant that was here closed and this one probably should as well.

This was the biggest surprise of Mexican food I have had in a long time. Having been in Missouri for the last three years, good quick Mexican is nonexistent. I always crave good Mexican that isn't overpriced and dripping with grease.   Let's start with the best part. This was the nicest Filiberto's I have ever seen. It is actually the nicest quick Mexican place you will ever see. They have you order for take out up front but it looked like you can sit and have a waiter. There is a full bar, tv's and a huge screen with a video game you could play. None of those is the norm for a Filiberto's.   What was normal was the awesome food and decent prices. I can't ask for anything else. I had a California and my wife had a shrimp burrito. When I asked for more salsa they obliged quickly. I asked for a bunch. Maybe 4 of each is what I said. Then the server brought out at least 5-6 of each type in a bag. Over the top.   I wish I had known about this Filiberto's before. I will come back to this Fili-B's.
