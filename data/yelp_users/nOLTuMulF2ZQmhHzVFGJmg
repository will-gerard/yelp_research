Grandma's Kitchen.............it looked like grandmas kitchen, but didnt feel like it. The decor was pretty solid and had a country feel. I wanted to like this place, I really did.................My GF and I decided to have breakfast here on a Saturday moring.   There was no one there when we arrived, service was prompt and items were delivered prompt. I had no clue what my waitress' name was or her helper. There was no review of the specials or the daily quiche availability.   There was plenty of time to decide on what to order,........though i could feel the service staffs eyes burning a hole in the back of my head while I reviewed the menu.   I could also hear the Cooks kitchen conversation going on, it wasnt vulgar or anything but honestly it was kinda weird, and not that cooks are supposed to look professional or anything, but when they come out of the back to get coffee, maybe say hi rather than staring at us from the other side of the counter.   Portions were good, I am Biased against fake eggs, by fake eggs I mean Eggbeaters and this is what they use for Omelets, no flavor at all. The Sausage patties were pretty good but kinda thin. There was also an unusual display fridge with items in it, not sure what it was for, or what the items inside were for.  I gave this a 2 star rating because of atmosphere, service staff and price.   I also think a local paper would go a long way......  They Swung for the fences and hit a foul ball.

Loved the decor and considering this is a Phoenix staple, im sure it hasnt changed in a long time. Food was very fresh and the service was excellent.  We had Dinner with a good friend visiting from NY, he had never had real Mexican food, I had the Posole"red" it was nice and spicy.  MY friend loved the selection of Mexican beers. He said it was the best Mexican food he had ever had.  This will be my new tradition for visitiors to AZ.  Cant wait to go back when the weather is nice and sit outside!

Great spot for donuts and coffee, Im a tried and true NY'er this hits the spot.   The Jalapeno and Cheese Croissants are amazing.   They do Ice Cream, MIlkshakes, Smoothies and Boba.  Management is very nice and welcoming.   They also have some very unique options as far as donuts go, tiger tails are great !

Joann and her daughter do an excellent job in both the dining room as hostesses and in the kitchen with food.   The Lunch Buffet is an excellent deal, quick, hot and always ready to go.  My Favorite is the PAD SEE EW, Pad Thai, ribs and the Thai style wings.   All the Curries are excellent as well. oahhhh dont forget the Chicken soup or beef soup  Get the Dessert its sweet sticky rice, custard and coconut ice cream........cant go wrong.  for like $10.79  you cant go wrong, plus its all HOMEMADE!

Wow! What a great place!  Vegas style buffet Blooms in the Desert.  The selection is fantastic, they have 4 different Islands of food with Many trays in each Island  Grilled steaks to order, Sushi, Mongolian BBQ..........you cant go wrong.  For the Price its the best buffet in town. Service has always been excellent and prompt. It always seems to be busy as well.   NO Complaints from me, I have high expectations of places, this is a 5star buffet in comparison to the other options out there in the Valley and for about 11 bucks with tax you cant go wrong.
