Aguas frescas -- Some of the best I've ever had. Get it.  Food Court -- Walk up, look at pictures, order food, ENJOY. Seriously good food.  Great salsa bar too. Fill your plate with salsa, cilantro & onions, & pico de gallo. Sit - Plenty of seating for you & friends.  Groceries -- CHEAP, stock up on those fruit and veggies. Pastries -- By the front entrance, grab a tray and load up.  It can be a little hectic, crowded and overwhelming depending on when you go but, that doesn't discourage me. It's a little spicy gem.

Im Uber impressed with their ER. Unfortunately, my mom went here after slicing her finger, to the bone when a glass broke and went into our garbage disposal. My hubby took her to the ER, she had stitches, pain meds and home within an hour and 20mins ( On xmas eve). I literally FELL down a mountain while hiking this morning. Really messed myself up. Once in ER I was rushed back because they thought my wrist was broken and knee possibly dislocated. 9 x-rays, pain injection, wraps on my leg, a sling for my arm, RX meds and I was wheeled out the door in 1.5hrs. AMAZING. Staffs super nice and very caring. Very attentive. They get you in and out. They were even short on staff today!

Exceptional. Fantastic. Mind blowing. Impressive. Just a few words that come to mind. Also, make reservations.   5 course meal called the chiefs special. Not even sure if it's on the menu (?). 5 course meal of pure decadence. I'd recommend not eating the bread because the food is outstandingly filling. We couldn't even eat our dessert as we were too stuffed. I believe it's 97.00 per person.   Considering the food, the ambiance, exceptional service plus the amazingly beautiful views, it's worth every penny. Perfect for a birthday, anniversary, or celebration of any sort.  Have a cocktail one level below at the cocktail lounge and soak in the view.  Let the stress dissipate and enjoy the company you're with.

Finally found a Chinese restaurant in my hood!   We've ordered take out 4 times within the last 2 weeks if that give you any idea of how much I like this place. I don't know how, but the takeout food is still HOT once you get it home and start making your plate. I personally love this, because who wants to nuke something 20 mins after picking it up? Not meeeee.   Quick service - take out was FAST and the restaurant was packed. Reasonable prices 7-12 range for dinner. LARGE servings (1 order of Cashew Chicken can be 2-3 meals for me. My husband more like 1-2 meals).   We've been happy with everything we've ordered. Flamingo chicken is my hubs favorite, but we've also done chicken fried rice, egg friend rice, beef & broccoli, kung pao chicken and cashew chicken (mentioned above) and its all awesome. Except the Kung pao - but that's probably my fault because I asked them to not make it super spicy, as I'm not a fan and it was lacking flavor in general. (but like i said probably my own fault.)   Can't wait to try more!

I'm in love! The owner greeted us the minute we entered. He pointed out that they use plastic liners in the basin that you soak your feet in, and are thrown out after each pedicure - SOLD!! I love the fact that hygiene is of the utmost importance. You can catch some pretty nasty stuff at nail places. The basic pedi is 22.00 and goes up from there. My Mom and I both did the Paraffin wax pedicure (it was wonderful), I did a French manicure & design and my Mom did a solid color, total cost was 79.00 for the two of us - not bad! Hygiene, great prices, and fantastic service -- never thought I would find all 3 in one salon :)   *They also have a HUGE selection of colors for gel nails which is usually very limited.  ** They also prefer CASH rather then debit/credit card and have a sign saying so.

Update to previous review.At this point we go regularly on Saturday mornings. I'd suggest going early for the best selection. I bring my own reusable bags vs the huge plastic bags they provide. Dont forget to grab a clip board (by where you pay) and write down quantity of produce as you go. If they are out of an item or the selection is slim, just kindly ask them if they have more in the back. Usually they do! The prices can't be beat. Example: case of strawberries was 3.00, red bell peppers .15 cents each,case of mangos 6.00, etc. Each trip is a little adventure because you're not really sure what you're going to get.

Total Dive. If I had just stumbled upon it randomly, I would've just walked right back out, but my friend raved about it. Fish and Chips are great. Shrimp cocktail is amazing. My husband really likes the hush puppies but I'm not a fan. Prices are a little high but its seafood, to be expected. I like the cheesy decor and shady location.. Makes it more of a word of mouth joint.

A friend ordered a bucket of the medium wings for a get together. SO GOOD! They have the perfect amount of flavor without burning your face off. They are crispy, rather then soggy and nasty like some other joints. There is no excuse for soggy wings. The bucket fed 4 adults and 2 kids (along with pizza) and we had an entire container still left after everyone was done. The price is kind of steep -- around 38.00 for bucket & large ranch, but it was really worth every penny.

This place is great. We've only gone twice and done two orders for take out. Service is always friendly and quick. HH is the time to go. Margaritas are my go to. Steak tacos were tasty, fishy tacos yummy and my hubby always goes for the polo special, which is basically pollo magnifico if you remember Julios in Scottsdale. Like the chesse crisps as well. Nice large outside patio off the bar area. Plenty of seating with every sports game imaginable in the inside bar portion. If you live in the area highly recommend.

Really enjoyed their pizza. Ordered on a Tuesday and the girl informed me it was buy 1 get 1 free that night. Total score! 14.00 for 1 lrg pepperoni and 1 lrg cheese. Going to try the bianca pizza next time.

We found this place by accident. We were heading to a BBQ and needed to grab some beer. The owner greeted us immediately & was super friendly. He took plenty of time to tell us about his selection and offered up some great recommendations. You can make your own 6packs and the price is around 8.50 - This is always a plus as its nice to try new flavors but not have to purchase an entire 6 pack. Great selection and awesome customer service, A+ in my book! Plus, I really like supporting a local small business.

Great selection, nice staff. Carry a lot of goodies you're unable to find at other places. A nifty drive thru if you're into that kinda thing. Yet to check out the downstairs bar... The night we went apparently they only had 5 customers at 10pm and shut her down. We will try again!

When we go in to eat its like seeing an old family member. Tottie and her staff always makes you feel welcome.  Bun Tom is one of my favorites --Charbroiled pork, shrimp and Tottie rolls with fresh lettuce, fresh mint, peanuts and rice vermicelli. Pho Tai is great. Spring rolls are awesome. Depending on time of year she makes the most incredible avocado ice cream. Trust me, its perfection.

Call it in a head of time. There's always a line and its not fast service by any means. Inside is kind of cramped and outside seating is very limited. Customer service is not where they excel, but I've gotten over it. Getting in and out of the parking lot is always entertaining but well worth all the hassle.   They have a lot of different pasta salads in their deli case that you can get by the pound, perfect to go along with your sandwich and so far all that I've tried have been delicious.

The Chicken Shawarma is awesome.   Hummus, Tabule and freshly made pita bread Arabic coffee will put hair on your chest but YUM!  Iced tea is the sh*t - its an orange black tea  Salad dressing is freshly made and you can buy a container to take home The market area has great prices on spices  Quick service once you finally get a table, lunch is a nightmare Call it in ahead of time & get it to go or get there early

Very "in crowd" but not overly snotty. The seating is a little on top of each other but the food and drinks make up for it.   They DO NOT take reservations so be prepared for a bit of a wait depending on when you go. Gluten free menu available upon request. They also offer take out if your in a hurry call it in ahead of time.   Tried: Bonfire Chicken - looked amazing Cobb Salad - Worth 14.00 plus! Its HUGE and delicious  Burger Au POIVRE - Yum  All American Grilled Cheese - Perfection  Every single thing was fantastic! I've raved about this place to anyone who will listen.

Vietnamese coffee = hooked for life. Starbucks who? Served iced, as it melts the flavors meld into sweet, smooth, heavenly goodness.  Fresh bread - Soft, warm, cheap.  Breakfast Sandwiches - Freshly baked croissants filled with bacon, cheese, egg, etc.  Lunch Sandwiches - Tried the pastrami mustard and loved it. Very filling.

Guava is my favorite but they only have it once a year, get you hooked and then take it away... Birthday cake is strangely addicting Pistachio is buttery goodness Ferrero Rocher is my current addiction My husband loves salted Carmel and tiramusu   They will let you taste as many flavors as you'd like so you can't go wrong. The kids working there are very nice. Prices run between 5.00-15.00.

We live closer to the Walmart on Bell & 19th Ave but I wouldn't shop at that location if my life depended on it. This Walmart is beautiful! Well stocked, super organized, better selection, etc. I was really impressed with this location but I guess after going to 19th ave store ANYTHING would impress me.

Everything is good. Get there early for breakfasts as there's always a line! Huge deli to browse while you wait. The menu is overwhelming so take your time or get some recommendations from your server.   Some of my Breakfast favs:  Chompies Benedict  Bagel Breakfast Skins - the bagel flesh is removed and then filled w/scrambled eggs, chopped bacon, green onions, potatoes, and topped with melted cheddar cheese Bobka Crumb French Toast is AMAZING if you want sweet this is it! Corned Beef Hash -- order extra crispy if you like some crunch like I do  All very good!

Ordered Gyro meal - Gyro is piled with tons of gyro meat, tazique & red onion. Fries come with the meal. They were also really tasty. Next time I'll sub greek salad.  Husband ordered Steak Plate - This was incredible. The meat has a seasoning that you can't put your finger on. Its mouth watering. They do something to magical to the rice, its so good. Also, had a greek salad - dressing was fresh tasting, really light and lemony, which I really liked.  Overall, I'm in love.

My husband works for Fort McDowell (not the hotel) so I'm well aware of how far away it is. However, if you do some research ahead of time there's a lot to do. If you can't find anything interesting at the casino head to Fountain Hills. Its a 10 min drive away. Mostly inhabited by snow birds that fly here for winter, you'll find Starbucks, Target, Ross, Fry's, Pei Wei, etc. If you can't find what you like here, head further down Shea to the North Scottsdale area. Its a ritzy, beautiful area about 20 mins from Fountain Hills. I really enjoy the fact that this hotel is out of the hustle and bustle of the city. Take in what Arizona has to offer, the sunsets, sunrises and wildlife.   I've never been disappointed with this hotel and we've stayed here about 8 times. When you pull up its beautiful. Complementary valet parking is super convenient. Check out the pool, its pretty impressive. Tons of chairs to lay out and enjoy the sun and 2 hot tubs. The rooms are nice and large with down comforters, sleep number beds, over sized robes and a sitting area by the window. I've NEVER experienced bed bugs as a previous yelper indicated. I really hope that was an isolated incident.   We've ordered room service multiple times and its always been hit or miss. Sometimes its amazing other times blah. The restaurant right outside the hotel entrance (Ahnala Lounge) had a really good breakfast selection buffet or plated meal and you can order espresso! My cappuccino was heavenly. They also do Lunch and Dinner.   I would highly recommend checking out http://fortmcdowelladventures.com/#   They offer Friday night franks & a movie and admission is free.  Horseback riding Segway tours in the desert (sounds interesting, yet to try)  Jeep trail rides  The grounds alone are beautiful.   I booked a facial the last "stay-cation" we planned and it was wonderful. Enjoyed every minute of it. Would book again for sure.

Love Pita Jungle.   This location is MUCH more relaxed then the Tempe location. We arrived at 12:30 on a Monday and got seated right away.   Ordered Seared Ahi Tuna salad -strawberry, pineapple, mango with sesame dressing YUM!!  It was amazing.  Girlfriend ordered black bean burger - Not my thing but she was happy.   Nice chill Pita Jungle -- Awesome.

Amazing food! Recommend doing reservations on the weekends. It's a tiny little place and fills up fast. If you do have to wait for a table, venture next store to their market! So many great things. Exploring around is a great time killer. Tons of spices, incense, wall hangings, plethorae of Buddha decorative items, etc.   Back to restaurant... I'm a newbie to indian food, so I won't go into detail regarding what we ordered. We went off the recommendations of our server. The food was to die for. The naan bread made with pistachios and other yummy items is to die for!! We all ordered our spice level at 3 - on a scale of 1-10. 3 was almost way too hot. If you're not a fan of spice/heat be weary. I'll I'll probably do a 1 next time as I'm not a fan of burning my face off.   Nice little bonus, if you check in on Yelp you will receive a free rice pudding dessert. It's pretty darn yummy with spices and a fruit swirl on top.   It's not cheap to eat here, however it's worth every single penny! If you sign up to their mailing list they often send out BOGO offers on entrees! :) Give it a try! If you're a newbie like us, don't be intimidated. They are all very sweet and helpful.   The serves wasn't the BEST but there happened to be 2 large parties of 8 people each. So we cut them some slack ;)

This is for the Bar Menu -- happy hour only. A friend of mine had her 30th birthday celebration at BLT. Very Swanky hotel and bar. An example, when we pulled up there was a Lamborghini in the Valet parking. No big deal.   Loved the Mango "Mule Kick" & Strawberry Crush Cosmo -- they are 5 stars all on their own. We were very pleased overall with our experience.   The only down fall was the events manager told us we were unable to bring in her birthday cake because it wasn't from their facility? I can understand this to an extent. Our entire party of 25+ had to hike to their villa where we were able to sing Happy Birthday and enjoy some cake.   I would definitely return for happy hour but never have another event here.

Walked up instead of drive thru because Im a newbie. Girl at ccounter was SUPER sweet and gave me lowdown. Asked her for some of the best sellers and she hooked me up with an awesome drink. She also told me it was on the house since it was my first time!! So incredibly sweet of her! I will be back for sure. It was also extremely fast! HUGE fan of that too.

Love the Sunday champagne brunch! You pay before entering, a word to the wise if your unsure of the place ask to take a look at the food BEFORE PAYING, this has saved us countless times at other places & they are happy to accommodate!! Once seated a server will ask what you'd like to drink and then let the games began!   I think its around 15-20 per person, champagne included! Dipping station with chocolate fountain is my favorite, Strawberries, marshmallows, rice krispies.   We also did their Christmas Day buffet and ended up just as happy! To be able to relax and enjoy your food rather then slaving away in the kitchen was priceless! Good variety for everyone.   I'm usually not a buffet person but pretty happy overall.  Pricing:  *Sunday Champagne Brunch: $17.50 adults; $11.95 kids  *Lunch Mon-Sat: $9.95 adults; $6.00 kids  *Dinner Sun-Tues: $14.50 adults; $7.95 kids  *Dinner Fri & Sat: $19.50 adults; $13.50 kids  *Dinner Wed & Thur (Crab Legs): $17.50 adults; $7.95 kids  *Holiday prices vary

I'm in love. Everything you've heard is true. It's that good.  They nailed it in the ambiance department.  Candles cast a sexy glow at your table and through out the restaurant. We had a large party of 15 so we ordered tons of bruschetta and passed it around the table and a couple (or 7)  bottles of wine - service was fantastic and everyone was very happy. Can't wait to go back!  Oh, the FREE VALLET is a super bonus!!

A true oasis.  Feels like you've found a little piece of paradise. The Owner and his wife are really cool people.  Buy fresh veggies, herbs, flowers, starter seedlings etc.  You can buy their composted soil by the truck load. My garden went crazy.  WALK AROUND. Soak up the energy and get tons of great gardening inspiration.

Prices are reasonable. Couple things I didn't like -  1. The spot free air blowing thingy at the end, did not do an adequate job in drying the vehicle off (most important part in my opinion).  2. They offer free vacuuming - If you drive a larger vehicle heads up, you can't reach around to the trunk/rear cabin area. I could only reach to the back tires of my Expedition. The main reason I was there was to vacuum out dog hair from that area. Spots are angled so its annoying to try and back in. 3. Parking is tight for larger vehicles (Usually not a big deal but it was packed)

LOVE THIS PLACE! :) The food is amazing and the market is a great place to browse while waiting for your order. Our first visit the older couple working the counter were so sweet and helpful. They offered us samples of everything - baklava, lentil soup, hummus, etc. The hummus is addicting, I could eat it daily.

This has to be the SLOWEST Starbucks I have ever been to. I don't understand it. It doesn't matter the time of day/week -- its slow. If you don't have a good 20 minutes to wait, go elsewhere. And people if you have over 2-3 drinks to order DON'T use the drive thru! That's just common sense, right?! We got stuck behind someone that ordered 7 drinks! Not kidding... 7! Who does that?

Went on a beautiful Sunday for a girlfriends bridal shower. This place is gorgeous. We had a separate area with a beautiful brunch buffet set up and it was lovely.  I'm not really able to write a well rounded review as I didn't dine as usual, but the food was delicious and the sticky buns are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I wasn't going to try one and another girl forced me to and they were TO DIE FOR! I'm stillllll craving them. I might have to go just to get a sticky bun fix.

Complete and total disappointment. Started by waiting behind one lady who was ordering and it gave us plenty of time to browse... We wanted 1 of everything, it all looked that amazing. Unfortunately, that's where my happiness died.  When it was finally our turn, the woman asked what we wanted, no hello, how are you, have you been here before, etc.. Ok, I said, "I found your business on Yelp and would like to know what items you would recommend or what are your biggest sellers?" The response was very lackluster and unenthusiastic. She said, "its personal preference." Ok, great, super helpful, thanks. When we asked what flavors were what in the case, she said "the flavors are all listed on a piece of paper on the front of the case..." Okay? So how can you tell which flavor is what? Unfortunately, I left my decoder ring at home because it clashed with my outfit.   So in my last attempt I asked about the macaroons and which flavors are popular or sell quickly? ((Is this a difficult question? Honestly?)) I was told again "Its really personal preference."  Ok, I'm done. I Picked 4 flavors based on MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE and she disappeared into the back for 5 mins.   Within that time one of the girls came from the back, with a freshly frosted cake that looked delicious, and said "oh, your still here?" Yep. Still here. I asked what kind of cake she just put in the case and she said "carrot, would you like a sample?" Sure that would be lovely, as we were STILL waiting for our macaroons. She brought us a sample and it was amazing! I don't even like carrot cake and it was that good! (This girl was very sweet & helpful, to bad she wasn't at the counter instead of frosting and baking)  The lady finally reappeared and our total was 7.50 for 4 macaroons and a really bad taste in my mouth about the whole situation. The reason I went is because I'm planning a fairly large party (85ppl +)  and was thinking about using them for a cake and or pastries. With all the yelp reviews being so amazing I figured it would be fantastic.   Clearly that isn't even a consideration after my experience. We honestly would have ordered one of everything if the service had been better. Customer service is everything in my book.

I have to write an update to my previous post. After I wrote my review the owner contacted me and apologized for my experience. He explained the problems he had and that I wasn't the only customer upset by this ladies behavior. I decided to give it one more shot. We went the day before Thanksgiving and the difference was night and day. The young guy at the counter was so helpful in describing all the beautiful pastries. The owner came out and started to chit chat with us while we waited on our macaroons. After a few moments of small talk I told him that I was the one bad review he had on yelp (AWKWARD!). He was so polite and explained the issues they had going on and he was so thankful we gave the shop a second chance. He even remembered I was over charged on my previous visit and deducted it from our grand total. Each pastry is a work of art. You almost don't want to cut into them. I now understand why all my fellow Yelper's LOVE this place.

Its okay...  Foods good.. Had the strawberry salad  Service is good...  Just really don't care for the clientele. Snooty Scottsdale women who "lunch".  Perhaps I wasn't in the mood, I don't know. Just did nothing for me.  Wouldn't go back.

This is our neighborhood grocery store. Prior to moving to North Phx I'd never been to a Winco. ITS HUGE. I find it much easier to shop on weekday mornings/afternoons, rather then weekends. It kind of gets overwhelming on the weekends. Think Costco crowded when they have all of those stupid food samples out. (drives me crazy) Anyway, the deli has really good macaroni salad and the rotisserie chickens are like 3 bucks(!) You bag your own grocery's and they have paper bags :) that makes me happy. Overall, its great. Just have to pop a xanax before shopping on the weekends.

Tried this place last night. SUPER TASTY PIZZA. We ordered the Supreme for 22.00 The slices are HUGE. The dough is a perfect mix of fluffy crust but dense at the same time and the toppings seem fresh. Also ordered Chicken Cesar salad that I was super unimpressed with. I didn't care for the dressing. Next time I'll do just pizza. They nailed it in that department.

We stopped her on a whim. So glad we did! Ordered Southwest Delight - Three scrambled eggs with spicy chorizo sausage, bell pepper, onions and tomatoes with sour cream & avocado slices. SO TASTY. Also ordered Almond Crusted French Toast - Thick egg bread dipped in our egg batter & encrusted with almond-cinnamon breading and grilled to perfection.FANTASTIC! Bacon is thick and meaty and coffee is strong yet smooth. Seriously impressed with this place. Check it out.

I really wanted to like this place. It's impressive when you walk in (compared to the dated carnival that is Casino Arizona) modern, open, good amount of seating and beautiful open air patio with sliding glass doors. That's about where the good ends. I had a party of 15. I'm not sure if our server was the ONLY server in the entire restaurant or ????? Our drinks took forever to get. So much so that half of our party ended up just go directly to the bar, rather then wait for her. The table across from us went and spoke to the manager regarding their nonexistent server.. right behind her my husband had a word with him as well. All that did was give our server a pissy attitude. AWESOME!! Perfect Birthday party.   The appetizers were really good. We tried 1 chicken & 1 steak quesadilla and a couple steak skewers. Food was super tasty! Drinks were terrible -- WEAK. I thought maybe it was just mine, so I had my friend (that's a non-drinker) try my vodka tonic and she said it tasted like.. TONIC -- FROM A NON DRINKER?! The entire table said their mixed drinks were terrible. We all decided to go into the casino and find a bartender that would pour a decent drink.   The topper -- We all closed our tabs and left. Later that night one of my friends mentioned that a 15% tip was already included in everyone's bill.... Wait WHAT? WE ALL TIPPED HER DOUBLE because we didn't read the receipt ((we just wanted to LEAVE)).  I dislike writing bad reviews because I know how hard it is working in the food industry. Everyone has an off day and perhaps they were down a few servers, but I really don't appreciate it completely effing up my birthday. Super disappointed with the entire experience.

I'm by no means a sushi snob, so I really enjoyed this place. The server was wonderful and super friendly, seating was immediate and the place was packed. We loved everything we ordered. The server even gave us everything on the happy hour menu and saved us about 20 bucks! Im kind of a novice so perhaps those with an advance palette would turn their nose up, but whatever, just means quicker services for me ;)

This shop is amazing! Coolest, chill guy answered all of our million questions and gave us great recommendations. We are newbies to vaping and currently had just the starter, 35.00 starter vape. We upgraded to fancy vapes :) and he gave us his honest opinion regarding products. Which was much appreciated. Didn't try and up sell us on junk whatsoever. Try the town drunk juice, its pretty epic. We bought 2 bottles worth. If you like their Facebook page you'll receive a 10% discount on your first visit. Even better, they have a veteran discount, you'll receive 15% off!! Highly recommend this shop. Honestly, one of the best we've been to.

I was disappointed upon our first visit, however we gave it another shot, then another, and another .... And it's amazing. I'm updating my review to 5 stars because they've earned it. Shaken beef sandwich, Awesome. You must try the snow! It's an unbelievable dessert. It's like a snow cone consistency but powdery as well, topped with fruit of your choice, (along with many other options) then they pour sweet and condensed milk over the top and that's when the magic happens. It's large, we split it between us and still feel completely satisfied. OUT OF THIS WORLD. I crave it every single day due to the 115 temps we are dealing with.

Horrible customer service! Will never go back. Ordered desserts to go and the service was terrible. Will never return again. Doesn't matter how good pastries are the service is deplorable.
