Even though this is a location with no drive thru, it is still faster than the drive thru's at other locations. So I come to this location instead.  The staff is nice and they usually remember my name and my drink which makes a girl patron like me feel special of course.

All of their ticket counters are somehow closed, not sure how a passenger is supposed to check in. Their kiosks also do not respond to touch as they are supposed to, super frustrating when they "time out". And the person who took my checked bag didn't say one word to me...lovely customer service.

I really appreciate the option for me to check in while I am at home. Nothing is worse than waiting for hours when you are so sick. The staff here was nice, professional, and quick to help me.  I will be using this Urgent Care instead of FastMed whom I will never visit again. They also have eprescribing which makes getting the rx much faster.

I have been here a couple times and was excited about the "deal" Yelp posted. I purchased $50 for $75 worth of merchandise, Triangles does not have a Yelp account so they were not aware of the deal. The owner and Tony were so nice and we're willing to honor the deal, I am so grateful as the bathing suits are for my honeymoon. I cannot thank the owner of Triangles enough!

I don't know how I have never written a review for TC's. I have been coming here for 15 years and it is by far my favorite breakfast place! The wheat germ pancakes, eggs benedict, Saturday's biscuits and gravy, and the passion fruit iced tea are just fantastic. It gets so busy after 9am, so if you can't wait for the deliciousness then I wouldn't come here.Oh, but it is worth the wait :)

This isnt my favorite Harkins, it is a lot busier than others in the East valley. The theaters are always hella cold too, but sometimes you have to bite the bullet because they have the best shows times. A plus is their staff is always very nice.

I love, love Sauce! The caprese salad, the spicy chicken sausage with poblano peppers pizza, and the sausage with caremelized onion pizza are so delicious! Restaurant is clean, lovely patio seating, and staff is friendly.

This use to be a Nike Outlet, now they ha e turned it into a Nike Clearance and have added a ton of merchandise. It is awesome to get my favorite rinni my pants, Nike Legends for 24.99 instead of 90+. That being said some prices are still stupid.

Coffee rush has been my favorite coffee place for about 10 years now. I love the owners and most of the staff are very friendly and greet you with a smile, and most remember your drink. To the good stuff, the coffee is phenomenal and never disappoints, whether you get a frost, tea, or an Americano....I am always satisfied.

I have been to this Sonic several times and more often than not their credit card system is down. The problem is once you pull in the drive thru you are stuck. So you dont get the treat you wanted and you have to sit there. So annoying. So the moral of the story is, if you come to this Sonic make sure you have cash or it is a waste of your time.

I absolutely kove Wildflower, and a lot of other people do to because it is quite busy during bkfast, lunch, and dinner times. But I dont mind because they are always quite fast at getting your food ready and bringing it to your table. I love that I can sit in and outside as well. I have never had any bad food here and I especially love the potato cream cheese soup. BONUS POINTS for being open on Sunday.

I love Pei Wei's food! I have been going to this location and others for many years and I have never had bad service or food. I love the patio at this location as well. The only downfall is it gets extremely busy around lunch and dinner.

I like this location for movies because it is not as crazy crowded as Harkins or AMC. They offer IMAX and 3D as well as matinees, student, and senior prices so it is just as conveinent as the others. The staff has always been friendly and theirs seats are comfy... Cheers!

Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite places to eat in "the valley". I love the Mesa location because it is larger than the other locations and I like the makeover on the patio. Tikka Masala is by far my favorite pasty...in fact I have never had a bad pasty and their beer selection is great! I guess I can't say enough good things...

My first couple visits here were not the best experiences, due to feeling unwelcome, not being offered a stamp card, etc. However, I decided to give it another chance and now I do like going here almost every morning for my iced Americano. They offer free WiFi, a loyalty stamp card, indoor and outdoor seating, and pretty darn good coffee.

I have been coming to Dr. Lucas for 5+ years, she is by far the best optometrist I have been to and I have been getting glasses/contacts since I was in third grade. The front desk staff is very friendly and that is always appreciated.

This drive through is always busy no matter what time of day I come here. Their card reader is always up and running and they never jack up my order so that is nice. The staff here is decent as well.

This location is not the original...however the food is just as good. It is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants and I have been coming to Rosas for 15+ years (original location)... The key is to dip thr chips in the red and green salsa and make a combo pack, so good! My favorite menu item is the veggie burrito with green sauce...but the shrimp tacos and flying saucer with beef are amazing too! The wait sucks during dinner time so just be aware of that and the service is sometimes questionable...but the food clearly makes up for it.

I usually love Oreganos...but today not so much. They changed the toasted raviolis and the new kind is not good. The service was mediocre only checked on us once in an hour and a half...just disappointed. And Oreganos needs to bring back the Veggie Wedgie.

I have been going to Thai Elephant and 5 R Cha in Tempe for 6+ years...and I am so happy they have this location out in Mesa where I live. I love the owners, they are so nice. I love the thai iced tea, fresh rolls, pad thai, tom kha, masaman curry...i just love all their food :)

This is my favorite sushi place in Mesa...maybe even all of Phoenix. The owners are nice and chill. The fish is fresh and delicious. I love happy hour because you get 10% of your sushi rolls and I haven't tried anything I don't like. I come here often with my husband and friend.

Firehouse is pretty good. I come here mainly for my man. But they are always nice and I ha e never had a bad sandwich. It does get pretty busy between 11:30 am - 1 pm, so if you are in a hurry avoid those times. I do love the beverage options :)

I like PF because of the price and the fact that with the black card I can bring a friend every time I go to any location. I like the hydro massage beds and the plethora of cardio machines. They could use more Smith machines and standing cable machines...most guys and myself fight for space/time on these machines daily. The whole "non-judgement zone" is kind of dumb considering its a gym and we all judge...their sign even makes fun of a guy who is a "lunk", isnt this judgemental?

I found this place with a friend one night and now we are obsessed. I love the simplicity of their menu and how fresh and delicious everything tastes. I normally get the tacos and their amazing horchata!

I recently locked myself out of my house (don't ask). I called several places on Yelp to get some assistance and every business was too busy or didn't answer their phone. I then noticed the ad on Yelp for The Lock Shop so I called hoping I wouldn't get the run around like the other places I called. To my surprise, a very pleasant lady answered promptly and got Jeff dispatched to my house right away. Even though she said he would be there in 30 minutes, he was there in less than 15 minutes. Jeff was professional, friendly, and just my kind of personality that makes me want to support this business 100%. I also received a follow-up call from Taylor and a 10% discount and thank you letter in the mail. The Lock Shop is great and I will definitely use them again for keys, lock outs, etc.

I really like the salads here, I get the caprese w/ chicken most often. The drive thru is pretty quick but can get backed up at times. The people are very nice and that is a plus in my book :)

I do not like this apartment complex for various reasons...the a/c unit went out the first month my BF was in this place, the toilets dont flush correctly, it is loud as hell all the time, and someone hit the back of our truck and of course didnt leave a note :/

I had my first visit here today after trying to come for several months, but they are closed on Sunday which is real annoying. I ordered a panini and some soup, the soup was ok, served with cold bread and a pad of butter. The panini had no pesto on it even though it was chicken pesto. My friend ordered the triple double melt sandwich and it was super greasy. I am also told the mens bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I will not be returning to this establishment and will go to my favorite place instead, Wildflower Bread Company.

I have been to over 30 massage therapist and there is no one that compares to Joel. He is the only massage therapist I will see for over 6 years now and he is absolutely amazing. Whether you need to relax, unwind, have an injury, or long term pain...Joel has the technique and experience to help you.

I have been here twice now and I really, really like the food. The blueberry green tea blender is pretty amazing as well. There hasn't been a wait when I have come here, but it does appear to get busy. Despite that, the food is delivered to the table quite quickly so I don't have any complaints about the food or service.

I have truly enjoyed my experience at this dealership. All the way from my British sales guy...to my service advisor Nick. They are so nice and are willing to joke around, while still providing great customer service. And I love my CX5 Touring Edition Mazda.

I love Thai food and eat it quite often. Thai Kitchen (TK) recently opened in my neighborhood and I couldn't be more excited. The food is delicious and fresh and the restaurant owners are very nice and easy to deal with. I generally visit Thai Kitchen 1 time a week and I have also referred my co-worker and her family to TK and they may frequent it more than I do. :)

I am obsessed with the health nut made with splenda and whey, it is so good. The staff is friendly and this restaurant location is always clean. The only downfall is the side fruit is usually not ripe or the fruit medley just tastes weird.
