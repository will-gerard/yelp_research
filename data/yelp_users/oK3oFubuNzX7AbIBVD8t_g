I'm not a frequent Yelp user, however this is best resource I can think of to share my experience with Rich, who is the manager of Ra-off of Mill Avenue.  I called into Ra for a pick up order at 5:23pm (I checked my phone log and later had to prove my call to the manager) for 2 Rolls & Edamame- the girl who helped me quoted 30 minutes until my food was ready.  When I arrived she told me they needed about another ten minutes- she offered to give me a call once it was prepared (which was nice of her to offer, too bad it didn't happen) After waiting back in my car for 10-15 minutes I still hadn't received a call, I walked back in to Ra and asked to speak with the manager.  Rich came out and introduced himself and I explained that I was still waiting on my food and it had been 50 minutes now (For two rolls!? Come on!! One was a California Roll!) He left to check on it, a minute later the hostess returned with my food.  Rich returned and said, "oh good you got your food" I said, yes I did, however it took over 50 minutes.  Rich responds with, "well what do you want me to do" (Isn't it management's role to ensure customers receive good service?)  I called in my food at 5:23pm (mind you, the receipt shown to me by Rich was time-stamped with the receipt print out time of 5:38pm) I then showed Rich my Call Log of when I called Ra.  He left me and proceeded to check several of his computers and returned saying, "your clock runs fast, the food only took 28 minutes to come out and weren't you told it would take 30 minutes" (I HAVE ATT'S iPHONE 5S, which provides time from a satellite) - I said, "you are insinuating that the ATT network can't keep time and NOT that the hostess rang in my food late?  Regardless I called Ra at 5:23pm and the food came out at 6:13" (Again, not a sorry.. not a- oh my, we were so slammed- which, important side note, THEY WERE FAR FROM SLAMMED)... he was just blaming ATT for providing me with a cell phone clock that runs fast and can't keep time.  (What an incredibly stupid thing to say) Luckily for him- I had a long day at work, as a property manager for 430 apartments (Safe to say I know when I am being treated with a lack of customer service as, customer service is what I do- day in and day out) so I just stopped reaching for an apology or waiting for him to offer anything that might improve my experience, he left with my receipts and gave me a credit of about $4.50   I guess moral of the story, Rich takes no pride in ensuring timely service with a friendly attitude, he'd rather blame the customer- hopefully your manager reads this Rich and can offer you some training in customer service since restaurants need that to thrive- surely negative online reviews can't be beneficial.

Don't see Josh!   I can't warn you enough! My hair is ruined. I uploaded a photo just as an example I'm not exaggerating. It is two weeks after my hair was fried off and no heat has touched it, my hair has been drenched in deep conditioner, and is still forced to be worn half way up.   See photo. But please, do yourself a favor and Don't see Josh.

If this had an option for zero stars I would choose that, Josh is the worst colorist of all times. Whatever you do, don't see him unless you want all of your hair completely broken off by bleach.

A fun unique spot on the the West Side- affordable drinks and lots of TV's for games/fights.  Good happy hour spot for after work w/ a few friends.
