This is my go-to authentic Mexican restaurant. The beans here are delicious! The machaca is awesome. I have not had anything bad here. The salsa that comes out is so flavorful and has a slow burn so be prepared.

Went there for lunch today. I needed something fast and yummy.  As I was walking up (after 1:30) I saw their specials.  Lemon chicken, yummy.  As I ordered, they were out, out of every pasta they made for today.  They had pizza but only margarita and bianca. I ordered one slice of bianca and back to work...I've had much better food.  Or maybe I just had my taste buds set for lemon chicken.

Gino's pizza is a South -Siders MUST! I was raised in south Phoenix, this to me is comfort food. I love this place.

Don't go to NYBB! The staff is is incompetent & lazy. Told the counter person I had never been there before. They literally walked away without saying anything. They didn't offer any suggestions/help/explanations. My order was wrong when I got it. Because it had the wrong condiments it tasted disgusting. NYBB is extremely overpriced. Do not go to NYBB!

I love Target, can't wait for the fresh produce department to get here.  Although, this location was recently remodeled.  I was hoping for a Super Target then.  So now they are going to put produce, looks as if my dream of a Super Target is slowly approaching, lol...maybe in a few more years :)

Do not go to MBI unless you absolutely have to. The testing there may be free but it is worth paying your copay so you don't have to go MBI. The wait is extremely to long. The waiting room is crowded & dirty. Many sick people come through there and it does not look like they keep the areas clean.   Would give less than 1 star if I could. Do NOT use MBI!

Would give less starts if available. Was DISGUSTED from pulling into the parking lot  to walking out.   Parking lot & outside appearance is dirty, run down looking. Restroom was filthy, old, graffiti, unsanitary but that's not the worst part.   An employee was smoking in the restroom while using the stall!  As a non smoker walking into a tiny smoke filled restroom is the worst. Also the employee did NOT wash his hands for the state mandated time.   Would have complained to the manager but had no idea who they were. The counter person acted as if they did not want to help me. I told her I had never been there before & didn't know what they had. Her only response was 'ok'.   Was only 7 people in the place & it took an unnecessarily long time to get my food. Almost every table was dirty. Had to clean off my own table. Drinks station was filthy & didn't work properly.   Fries were limp, bland, gross. Burger bun smelled like fish. Had to remove it.   I didn't want to spend any second longer than I needed to in that place so didn't complain to anyone. Not like it would have done any good. The employees seem like they are being tortured by working there.   How is place even still in business? Do Not go to steakenburger! Do NOT go to steakenburger!

My kids have been coming here for dental cleanings, filings and sealants for almost all their entire childhood. My youngest now, is coming for orthodontic work. I have never had a bad experience at this practice. Nor are my children reluctant to attend their appointments, that in itself says a lot for their experience.   The lobby, although has a few games and a small TV for entertainment, is not so inviting, but the good news is the wait is never long.   The staff and doctors take the time to talk to you and explain the processes to you. I am definitely a fan of this practice.

The Yelpers helped me out again. There were enough good reviews for me to give Captain Bill's a try. It's near my house and I have passed by it many times but never tried it. The inside is small but uniquely decorated. I didn't eat there, took it home.  Good prices - $6.93 for 10" vegetarian sub, small tea, chips. Sub tasted good. Had 4 cheeses, all the veggies & avacado.   Will definitely have their food again but will order take out.

I use to go to the Petsmart on 59th and Northern but when I was disconnected by the grooming department more than once I decided to try another one. If you can't answer the phone, why would I trust you will my dog!   The staff at this location was amazing. Even though, I thought, 2 hours was a long time for a regular bath and brush with some nail grinding...he got exactly what I asked for. His paw-gress report (get it) had little paw prints to show how he did and they scheduled me again for 6 weeks.   I will definitely go back, hopefully 2 hours won't be the norm, especially around dinner time....Axel came home starving.

Thank you Buffalo Wild Wings for opening up 200 yards away. I will never go back to Metro now that there is another option. Service is horrible. Only have 1 good place to watch the TVs, any other spot in the bldg you can't see. Greatest feature- walking distance to Buff WW

Customer service means a lot and Joes does not have it. Found Joes by accident and it looked inviting from the outside. They make their money off serving the after clubbing drunk crowd who just want the closest food. Someone needs to tell the counter employees to treat people who come in there on a Wednesday afternoon with appreciation & respect.   A strange non-feature is that there's no iced tea. No sweet, unsweet brewed, or fountain tea. Also not a large selection of fountain drinks and one of the flavors was not working.   The veggie sandwich was really good (see pic.) Thats the only positive thing I can say about Joes.   Got an order of cheese fries and they were disgusting! The fries were soggy with no seasoning. Don't know what kind of cheese was melted on them but it wasn't good either (see pic)  The only reason I didn't try the pizza was that it had flies all over all the pizzas and the employees clearly didn't care. Since they leave the doors open the small, crowded restaurant has many flies all over you food.   Even after the next time I leave the club in search of munchies one night I will NOT be going to Joes.

This location is closed. My only question is what took so long? Quiznos food isn't very good but it's better than some other sandwich shops.   The reason this location should've been closed a long time ago is the service. The woman who runs/owns the place was a total C*NT! She was always rude. She had no idea how to move the process along which made ordering & getting a sandwich take 10times longer than it needed to. The People making the sandwiches were inept. I see the closing if this place as justice. She & her staff should NEVER be allowed to serve the public again!

I live in Glendale and this place is in Scottsdale...so we def have to 'plan' to eat here.  The food is good, you can't even tell that it's not real meat.  I wish they had a location closer to Glendale.

Decided to try this little place based on all your reviews. Place was pretty empty, hubby ordered their deep dish margarita pizza and it was 45 minute wait, which is fine since it advertises that in the menu. Drinks are a $2.50 which is too expensive for me. My husband asked if they sold beer and they do not but we were told we can bring our own, game changer! Pretty awesome! Went across the street bought our beer came back and still had 20 minutes to spare, lol. I ordered the thin crust and it was pretty good. Deep dish was also very tasteful. Going back to try their homemade sausage, since all the workers were raving about it. Beware fellow yelpers, small feed 3 comfortably.

A complete waste of time. Do not go there.   Their selection is small and unusable. They have many school uniforms but prices are better most other places.   Was looking for simple, grey, cargo shorts - not one pair in the building. They weren't out, they don't carry them.   Every bad customer service review in Yelp is right. Door says open at 10:am, person didn't get there until 11:15. No excuse or remorse just gave a reason as they don't know their schedule.

The food is not good & everything is overpriced. You're paying higher prices because it's Scottsdale.   The only good thing is that they have a larger selection of draft beers than most places.

I've been here plenty of times and Never have I ever received such as small drink. Wtf? And when I voice my concern the girl says "it's bigger then the ones we usually give". I've been here before and no, that is an utter lie! I left as a very unsatisfied customer.

Came here with some co-workers.  Wanted something else besides my usual salad. I opted for the Prime Rib Sliders...they were not good.  They were cold and when I told the bartender he set them right back.  So the customer service was great, but even warm they were just not good.  Definately not worth the $16.00 plus tip I had to pay.  Guess I will have to stick to salads if I go back, at least that is suppose to be cold :)

Overrated. Don't go out of your way. The tortillas are better than most places but the entire dishes are not special. If you are in the neighborhood its worth a stop but don't make a special trip.

We've rented from the Glendale location 3 times. Each time the service is better than the previous time. The customer service people are polite and very helpful. If there is an issue with a car it is taken care of immediately. The employees are the reason we will rent from this location again.   The only reason not 5stars is that there is a 3.25% "stadium" surcharge (for the University of Phoenix stadium district.)

So far, I've done this for a full month. Like the variety of veggies that i would not normally purchase. It makes me take out the cookbook and start getting creative. Too much fruit for me. If there was a way to purchase just a veggie or fruit basket that would be cool. Either way, i am heading back this Saturday. I do agree pick up time is early, but I'd rather do it before it gets over 100 degrees out.

We are still on the search for the great milkshake, tasty burger and yummy fries.  I have to admit they have the best cherry coke in town and I love the tiny pieces of ice.  I had the turkey burger, it was okay.  My husband had the vegeterian patty.  He said it was just okay, pretty dry.  He asked for their special sauce and they didn't put it on.  My daughter liked the milkshake, she didn't say it was delish tho.  The fries were thick which is good, but no flavor, which is bad.

This place has awesome food.  If you are looking for flavor, this is it.  it's a bit pricey tho.  Under $10 for a meal for lunch, not what I am willing to pay.  But when I feel like splurging this is it.

The waitress was really nice but not very efficient.  Had the buffalo chips, which i really love. They make their own "chip" and some were really, really burned.  I ordered the chicken wings and they were absolutley dry.  I had to ask for more sauce to put on them.  Makes eating them not as much fun, when you have to correct them. My husband ordered the calzone and he was not impressed.

One star based on price. $28 for 2 sandwiches, cup of soup, 2 drinks. The food tastes fine but extremely overpriced.    We were in the neighborhood so decided to try it for the first time. We're probably never going to go back to any Wildflower. Paradise bakery and Panera bread are better, cheaper, closer substitutes.   Won't be going back to Deer Valley location. They were out of multiple breads and the whole restaurant had a dirty bleach water, mold smell.

I'm only giving it a 2 star because I absolutely think Paradise bakery is idiotically overpriced. Yes, the food is good but we had a breakfast sandwich and a small salad...no chicken, two drinks and it was almost 18 dollars.  My husband had a mozzarella and tomato sandwich and I had the SW Cesar salad. I really like this salad but again this place is completely over priced for a sandwich shop.  Maybe if they reduced all their items by $1.00 and not run their a/c unit as if they were chilling meat...it maybe a bit more bearable.

I read continuous reviews on Mr. Sushi and couldn't wait to try it out. When we got there.....the place had a different name, guess it changed management. I wasn't too sure what to expect but I can honestly say I was not impressed. The place was dirty, our table was dirty...and the food was nothing to rave about. Won't visit that place again.

Now, I understand the difference between vegetarian and vegan.   I eat meat and I love it, but my husband does not. So I wanted to surprise him and take him to dinner where he had choices. There were plenty of choices here. Don't get me wrong, I am open to eating anything. I was just as excited as he was.   We ordered our food, I got the sweet and sour chicken and he got the BBQ baguette. Our soup came out and it was so NOT good....very bland. We also ordered sushi...when it came out it was warm. Now, I don't know about you...but I frown upon warm sushi.   I actually enjoyed my meal, more so than the soup and sushi. But the portions were really small. He wasn't too crazy about his meal, although he said his meal tasted better than mine, I beg to differ.   We had to wait at least 15 minutes before he got his side of French fries which were $3.50...for a side...ridiculous. We also ordered Jasmine ice tea, which I needed a refill because it helped me swallow the bland soup and chilled up the sushi a bit. But we were denied. I heard her say she only makes 3 or 4 gallons and it finished. My husband heard her say, people ask for 3 or 4 cups and they lose money. HAHA, yup...talk about Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus. Either way we left thirsty.   We spend almost $30, and I honestly didn't think it was worth it. If you are in the area try it out, just don't make the drive if you're not.

Will never go back! The service was awful & the sandwiches are sloppy, ugly, poor quality messes. Only 1 vegetarian option, old/soggy toppings. Told the counter girl I had not been there before.  She gave no useful information. Told her I am a vegetarian. She made some condescending remark (possible joke but not funny.) Told her TWICE what I did not want on the sandwich, the cook in the window heard me & they still got it wrong. DO NOT go there.

DON'T go here for lunch! The Gus's is designed for the after club crowd. NOT the local businesses' lunch crowd.   The building doesn't have air conditioning, possibly only swamp coolers. It's too hot & humid.   The don't have fountain drinks or iced tea, only canned sodas & $1.50 small bottled water.   Service is extremely slow. Only two customers in the building and wrap took a lot longer than it should have. Employees are not knowledgeable about the menu, ordering.   Pizza is just ok/not bad (Joe's down the street is better.)  No reason to go back.

Last night was my first visit to Bueno Burger.  I'm not a huge burger fan, but after this burger, I have converted.  Got the Bueno Burger with cheese, lettuce, pickles, onions and thier Bueno Sauce....yummy!.    Next on the menu is the Sonoran Dog, I just hope it taste just like Guerros in Tucson, theirs is amazing.

What a waste of my money!  I can pan fry a burger at home and it will still taste much better that this place.  To think I spent almost $30 here, makes me angry...I want my money back.  My daughter got the Oreo shake which was really good.  But the burger was extremely disappointing.  Don't even get me started at how gross the veggie fries were....YUCK!

This burger place recently opened up in our neck-of-the-woods and we couldn't be anymore delighted. For us, it's our brunch-date, just us two while we are out running errands.   My husband is a vegetarian so this may not seem like a place he should visit. Unless you know that they have grilled cheese on the "secret" menu. Oops, maybe I let our a little secret, but that sandwich is damn good! It's basically a burger (yup all the toppings) without the meat. We get ours with grilled onions....YUMMY!

Yummy, yummy for my tummy!!!  Loved the tacky fountain as you walk in, lol. This place was clean, granted it has just opened. The food was fresh, the sushi was delish (for buffet) and the waitresses were really nice. We ate for two hours, well not straight eating but we were there that long. They sat us at the wall closest to the parking lot, we didn't sit by a window but it was really warm anyway. Next time, because there will be a next time, I will ask not to be sitted by the wall.  Three of us for dinner for $30...can't beat that.

Not for vegetarians. Had the mushroom burger, which is a giant mushroom cap on a bun. It was under cooked (cold) and soggy (weird) the taste badly over powered the topping and the bun. Will never go back.

A place that probably won't last, which is too bad. There's nothing bad to say about the restaurant, service, or food. Unfortunately there isn't anything good to say about the food either. The food is fine, it's just not worth going back for. Gave 4 stars because its clean & servers are nice.

Not impressed. Went for a pedi and waited for 45 minutes before they even started on me. Even after the pedi, it really was mediocre. I felt as if there was really no pedi done. I wanted foot scrub and pumice stone. I wanted my feet to feel silky smooth when I put on my flip flops, lol. Will I will it go back? Nah!

Wasted my time. Waited a long time for below average frozen microwave pizza. They don't have pizza by the slice at lunch time, or any time. DO NOT eat the overpriced 10" pizza. Never been to the previous location so I don't know about that one.  The only positives are the helpful servers.

Way overrated. We always trust the Yelp community. If something is 3 1/2 or more stars we have no hesitation to try it. The Yelpers let us down on this place. We paid $21 for small carnitas, pastor, barbacoa, carne asada, Cochinita Pibil tacos and a bean & cheese burrito w/ 2 drinks.   The beans were whole pinto beans. The cheese is shredded Oaxaca or cotija. Could not tell which tacos were which. They were all just shades of grey meat with NO flavor.   Very disappointed on the decor. the pics show a lucha motif but none of that was on the walls on 4/30/16.   Cannot give one reason to go to MWT. The best thing I can say is it wasn't awful (which is not the same as being good).   Will still try places based on Yelp ratings in the future.

Was fooled by the signage. The face of the shop says wicked fast. They have a sign near the register that says how long the oven is taking to cook that day. Was in the shopping center at lunchtime & decided to give it a try.   What I didn't know was that they don't have pizza by the slice. They build, then bake a personal pizza on pre-made dough that's just sitting out when you order it. The time it takes to cook it wasn't that much faster than anywhere else. Ordered the mini, cause really just wanted a slice not a whole pizza. The mini is too small & the regular is too big for one person. (see photo)   It tasted fine but not any better than any other place.   There is no reason to go there again.

Think of this as Jimmy Johns with wheat sub roll. The place is an exact copy of Jimmy Johns. From the menu, to the look, the atmosphere, even the receipt is similar.   The sandwich was fine, nothing special. the strange part was that they give you the inside of the bread that they removed (see pic). I didn't need it but it was different.   This location probably won't last because there is an actual Jimmy Johns on Mill that will get all the passers by. This location is not in a very accessible location when there is a lot of traffic.   E & G's is good if you are walking by and need a quick sandwich but don't make a special trip.
