Good chill spot after a game. Old school music videos in the background where it makes you reminisce of the good old days. Crowd vary in age and are there for a fun time. Drinks are cheap.  Here's the downfall. Food didn't look appetizing. Generic food that looks as if it came from a frozen box and was heated in a microwave. Wouldn't be surprised. I would stay away from there drink specials. It may be cheap but thats because there's no alcohol! My friend ordered a blue hurricane for $4 but asked for a shot for it since there was no hint of alcohol whatsoever. With the shot it came out to $12. So much for drink specials. They ordered another drink special in hopes it would be better. Fail. Sad to say but they returned it. Stick with beer. You can't go wrong with the flavor and amount of alcohol in it

My go to place when I want something delicious and quick. I always get the pho which is just so damn good! Noodles are soft and the broth is da bomb. Perfect remedy for a cold, sore throat, or an empty stomach. The other reason why I love this soup is that it has no stinky pho smell that most pho soups have. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?! Comes in a big bowl that can be shared or have it all to yourself! A little pricey but nothing to cry about. Mmmm...craving one now...I should go before they close in 30 minutes...

Love love love this place! Great place to relax and have some great grub. Food is always great which go well with any beer...depending on which kind you like. Don't like beer? They have wine and other liquors I'm sure the bartender can make a drink to your liking. Crowd is laid back and there to have a good time. Great place to watch games as well. They close at 2am which is good if you work late and need a beer to relax you. Cant go wrong with this place!

Awesome place for fresh produce, bulk of nuts & grains, and lots of wines/beers to choose from. It's Whole Foods merge with Trader Joes. Best of both worlds into one store. Cant get any better than that. I prefer this over Sprouts. Selection of organic products is not as plentiful as Whole Foods but what they do have to offer is fresh and affordable. I usually leave with more organic veggies and half the price in comparison to Whole Foods! Makes me a happy girl!   Give it a try...it'll make your wallet smile :)

Great steak! Cooked exactly to my liking. Not like most places where when you say "medium" it's cooked all the way thru! With this place, you actually see red in the middle and can chew the steak! Portions are fairly big so you can always share apps and entrees. Happy hour from 4-7 on Monday to Fridays. During happy hour, they have a delicious Orange Martini for around $3! Would definitely give that a shot. If you're not into fruity drinks, beer is around $2 as well as half price wines. Certain apps are also part of happy hour. Like I said, portions are pretty big so you can save by sharing. We've paid around $53-$70 and well worth it. Not bad for a good steakhouse! Crowd is a bit older but who cares when you're enjoying the food right?

Decided to come here after seeing the chef on Sonora Living. Went to the website and saw it had a pretty appealing menu and high ratings. Well I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong...the selection and prices were right but the seasoning was off. We had the scallops wrapped in bacon which was too salty even with the maple on it. Our chicken entree with a side of beans and rice was even saltier. Disappointing. Maybe I just got the wrong dishes? Nevertheless, won't be coming back anytime soon

Open 24 hours with minimal choices of entrees to pick from the menu. Not cool when you're out late...drinking like a fish and dancing till your feet hurt. After a good night out, I'm expecting something that will hit the spot and make me sleep like a baby after. Don't come here if that's  exactly what you're looking for.   Too bad there's really no late night spots in the valley. This is the time when I really miss New Yorks street vendors with ridiculous lines at 3am or Chinatown where you can eat to your hearts content & fall asleep in the back seat while someones driving you home or the diners where the menu is filled with so much choices but guaranteed a hearty meal or.....  What a disappointment

Love this place! Wish Phoenix  had more places like these. Lux is a chill place where I can enjoy a good cup of joe while I get lost in my book. Their quiche is scrumptious and pastries/cookies are heavenly. I brought my sister and she loved Lux!   Subtracted 1 star for the parking. Space is  limited in the back

Hubby took me here for velentines day. Must say, he got a big wet kiss for picking this place. Very fancy & romantic with it's dim lighting. We sat by the piano bar where a live band was playing that evening. Made me reminisce of restaurants in NYC. Service was top notch, even on a busy evening. Great wine selection. We decided on a bottle of Cabernet which was excellent! Sorry, forgot the name. Hubby had rib eye steak while I had the Chilean Seabass. We shared two sides of gorgonzola Mac n Cheese and wasabi mashed potatoes. I was expecting a dime size meal but I was mistaken. Portions are very reasonable! I am not a meat neater but holy mother of god...that steak was ammmaazziing! Perfectly cooked medium rare and it just felt so good in my mouth! So tender and well seasoned. My seabass was also good but I prefer Eddie Vs version. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this. Tasty & just kinda melted in my mouth like butter. However, the sides didn't do too much for me. Too much melted cheese on top. All I got was a big chunk of cheese with every bite which tastes like rubber band especially when it cools down. I was also expecting to taste some wasabi in the mashed potato but didn't taste a hint of it whatsoever. Regardless, we had a great experience & would definitely come back to try the other dishes this fine restaurant has to offer.

WOW. Not what I expected. I usually go to Four Peaks but decided to try something different. On a  Monday night I decided to see what other Yelpers suggested... we decided to go here. Walked in and was about to turn around. Not much patrons but what do you expect on a weeknight? Good thing we stayed because the food was the bomb diggity! Really not what I expected. We had the garlic fries and braised short rib sliders for apps. Good God... it was effin delicious! Not greasy like your typical bar food. Had the chicken with avocado burger (forgot what it was called) and  jeez...effin good too! It had a distinct taste with the right amount of spice. To top it off, we had the chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream  and tons of walnuts. With 2 beers (way colder than the ones Four Peaks serves & they have tons of selection) and a large glass of merlot, the bill came out to only $50 and some change. Can you imagine how much cheaper it wouldve been during happy hour?!   My tummy is happy...think we might have found a new spot....

Still love love love this place!!!! Great bartenders with their cool Irish accents and exceptional service. This place is so chill and just a great place to be to grab a nice cold beer while listening to a live band or watching a game. We come here about 2-3x a week...yea  I sound like an alcoholic... but can't help but come back for the good grub & beer. If you haven't tried this place, seriously ...go grab yourself a drink with a side of chicken tenders...you won't regret it.

Love Costco!! It has everything! Usually buy my fruits, veggie and meat. Also end up buying stuff that were not on my list. Hard to resist the deals and great price they have. They have a pretty good selection of wine, spirits and beer. Costco is also great w their returns. Ive returned something that was used because it broke. Had no receipt and they went back to my Amex connected w Costco one year back!!! Best part are the there free samples!! Portions are enough to make you full if you try most of them! Only downfall is I end up paying more than I anticipated because I end up buying more things than planned!!!!

What a disappointment!! We were looking forward to coming here with all the hype we heard about the food. What a freaking bust!!! Came here to watch the Bulls kick Heats ass. We were planning to watch the whole game but left early because the food just sucked! Had the nachos...blah! Cheese wasn't even melted and nachos not warm. Chicken fingers with fries & onion rings were just as bad! Fries & onion rings were stale, flavorless & had no crunch whatsoever. I didn't have the chicken but hubby said it was nothing to rave about. The only good thing about this place is the really cold beer. Fail!

More selection than Trader Joes but also be prepared to pay a little more. Good selection of beer, wine and sake. Place to be if you're the type of person whose into healthy and organic food. Plenty of selection. They also offer happy hour!

Love this gym! Instructors are awesome and will push you to your limit. Spinning classes are great! My heart rate is up to the roof with my sweat burning my eyes and running down my chin. I keep telling myself to try other classes but to be honest, I'm kinda intimidated by them. I should really suck it up and just go to them. I mean, there are old ladies joining those classes and are still alive! Pools are  big enough for everyone. You'll also find steam rooms and sauna. Nothing to brag about with the cafe food. It tastes really "healthy." Would give it a 5 star if the monthly charges weren't so high.

Came here on a Saturday morning and already a line was forming out the door. While waiting to be seated, people kept pouring in. I'm thinking "Man this place must be good!" The wait wasn't too long but food took a while...reason for the four stars. We ordered the country fried steak, eggs benedict and a side of biscuit with gravy.  Mmmmm...the wait was well worth it. Best bacon I've had. I kid you not. This bacon had a different texture, cut and taste. Country fried steak was crispy and the gravy on top made it out of this world. Eggs Benedict was tasty and the hollandaise sauce was not over powering. Great breakfast to get my Saturday started. Give it a try but be prepared to wait.

Seems more like a bar & restaurant rather than a quick stop for a bite. I was surprised when I walked in. The first thing I saw was the bar which were occupied by rather well dressed good looking people. Bar has 4 flat screen tv's playing sports and nicely stocked with various liquors, wine and beer. They also have a cheap happy hour menu. Food is also reasonably priced with a good portion. Had a great meal and would definitely go back. I'm still pleasantly surprised at how nice it is inside. Enjoy!!!

Never fails to amaze me. In comparison to other Fox Restaurants I've tried, this by far is my favorite of them all.  Reasons why:  1. Excellent drinks. No watered down crap or some fruity tasty drink with no alcohol. No sir...they're not playing when it comes to drinks. They make it good enough for you want to sip more without you tasting the liquor....but you can definitely get a good buzz even with happy hour prices.  2. Geez this sounds odd but dayummmmnnnn... The bathrooms are amazing!!! Makes me want to keep washing my hands. Yes... I know...sounds bizarre...but cmon..how often do you run into a bathroom nice enough to brag about and not mind going into!?  3. Now onto the food. Never fails. Everything I have ordered here are always yummy!!!! Always cooked to perfection with good presentation. From appetizers to entrees...you can't go wrong. Give it a try & you'll know what I'm talking about.  4. Servers are attentive and great. Take care of them and they'll do the same for you!  5. Conveniently located in a shopping area where you can walk it off then come back for dessert!!!!!  Goooooooo!!!!!!

Love this place! Always a hit when I come here! Food is fresh and mostly organic. Healthy but yummy. Even there drinks tastes healthy if that makes sense! Had the pomegranate drink with real pomegranate seeds in them!! There salads to burgers to brunches are all good. Affordable too. They also have live entertainment mostly every night. Great spot!

Another good eats by Fox Group. A small place with the usual cool green color displayed throughout the Fox restaurants. Prices are very reasonable for both food & drinks. However, the bartenders attitude & service could've used a little improvement. But that's just a minor thing that can be overlooked if you're looking for good food. Try the Kobe beef with the truffle fries. Beer right from the tap is refreshingly cold.   Good place for a late Sunday brunch...

Cute little hole in the wall that I passed 3x before finally figuring out it was right there in front of me! Came in on a Sunday with a mission to get my mouth full of sweets. Was hoping for a larger selection of goodies as I read all the different flavors in the reviews. I got the pop tarts, S'mores, Pistachio, Chocolate Chip and Pumpkin. Moist goodness with enough sweetness in the icing. Favorite one was Pistachio next to the Chocolate Chip. Would definitely go back now that I know where this place is. Hope they expand as it has potential.

Nice decor, spacious with a modern Greek feel. The white brick background gives the bar a good appeal. The staff are great and go out of there way to make your dining a good experience. Unfortunately those are all the good things that's good about this place. As with any new opening, food is mediocre and nothing to rave about. Not impressed at all. It's too soon to tell if this will be a hit but hope it will as service is excellent.

This is my third time coming here to fix a crack on my windshield. First time, the whole thing had to be completely changed. (guess thats to be expected living here in the desert) They did an excellent job with the replacement. They even placed back the sticker as a reminder for my next oil change! Recommend this place if you want quick, reliable and courteous service!
