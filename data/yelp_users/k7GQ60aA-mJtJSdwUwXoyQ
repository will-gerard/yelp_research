One star is giving this place too much. It smelt horrible when I walked in. The guy who did my nails hurt my cuticles - way too rough. After realizing how bad he was doing I said I didn't want a color and they charged me $20 anyways! $20 for shaping horribly and hurting my cuticles... Don't go!

I was extremely impressed by the customer service setting up this appointment. Very easy to work with over email. My house was left pristine. I can't wait to have them back in a few months!

Five stars. YASSSSSS. Our server was beyond personable and gave us a great recommendation on what to order. Fun vibe. Very busy.   Highly recommend coming for the brunch special. Also, brisket mac and cheese is off da chain.

The Kale Me Maybe juice is so refreshing and healthy! The salads are filling and have great unique flavors. I've tried two of their salads and both were delish! I can't wait to try a third.
