Feta gyro, how i love thee!   Athenian Express has an entire wall dedicated to menu options, and I just can't get myself to try anything different. The prices reasonable, the food fresh and tasty, it's a great lunch spot downtown. I visit, and will continue to do so at every opportunity. If i were to change anything, it would be to open for dinner and fix your soda fountain. But I am one happy customer! Lightrail accessible and parking in rear.

For you East Coasters, the slices of cheese pizza remind me of Papa Gino's! I do not usually get the traditional Italian food here because I am getting lunch and fear a food coma afterwards, but the slices of pizza and salad are excellent, and the portions are large. The used to not take credit cards, but that since has changed.

Where do I start? Pizza cookie? wings? stuffed sandwiches? pizza? I love Oregano's and it loves me. You should go. It will love you too. (But be prepared to wait on a Fri or Sat night! Very busy).

Velvet wallpaper adorn the dimly lit  walls here, and make you feel like Dean Martin might sit at the table next to you. Old school, in the classic sense. I used to work across the street from here, and would stop in from time to time for a great happy hour, occasional employee lunch for my staff or a special occasion dinner from time to time. Being from New England, it says a lot when I admit that they have the best Oysters Rockefeller I have ever had. Ever. The steaks are just wonderful, and the martinis perfectly poured. But you know what secret thing I ADORE about this place (besides the back entrance through the kitchen)? The bread. Warm white rolls smothered in a garlicky-leek chutney of some sort. For all those times your Mom told you not to fill up on bread, just disregard. She never had this bread. While I think you should always splurge here for a fantastic dinner, the real bargains are lunch and Happy Hour.

DANGEROUSLY located across the street from my old work, I hold Lenny's burger shop directly responsible for those 5 extra pounds I put on while working there. This place was great. Juicy delicious burgers and seasoned french fries were a staple at this joint, but you would be surprised what else they did well! My favorite was the country burger combo. Killer milkshakes too. And if you work in the area, they started serving breakfast a couple years ago and the breakfast burritos are solid. Conveniently located right next to the Thomas lightrail stop.

Nothing fancy here, but if you work in the area, these people are all business. They will have you in and out in 30 minutes, which is impressive for a sit-down restaurant. You have a salad with a fantastic lime basil house dressing in front of you within 60 seconds. They selection and price are very good, in my opinion. Not the most authentic Thai, but I enjoy it. You can even buy their house salad dressing by the bottle to take home.

Foundry, how I wanted to like you! But then you opened before you were ready and you are giving people the wrong first impression. Phoenicians are in dire need of a downtown music club. It's true. But I went to see Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers last Saturday, and couldn't stay for the 2nd half because I was so nauseated and dehydrated from the 101* and 80% humidity temps...indoors. It was hot. Bikram yoga hot. It's July in Phoenix, AZ so don't tell me you didn't know temp a/c units that were meant to cool a space 1/5 of the size of your facility wouldn't work. And the slow bar service. And the super secret bathrooms that required you to travel down an unlit, un-signed pitch black hall and feel around for a door.  I will be a good sport and try you out again in a few months once you get your sea legs. But that will not be any time soon. Good luck.
