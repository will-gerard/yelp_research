great chips, and flavorful spicy salsa! All the staff are friendly, even if you don't speak Spanish

I put off getting my first tatoo all weekend, before getting on the road to Phoenix I finally got up the nerve to go to Starborn on Sunday evening (I chose Starborn because Brent took the time to answer some newbie questions over the phone and was very encouraging).  After being EXTREMELY patient with my indecision, and sketching me multiple variations, I was tattooed by Donnie.  He is a true artist, HUGE attention to detail and takes pride in his work.  He made my first tattoo a lot less scary, and has an awesome dry sense of humor.  I was warned that once I got one I would want more, and they were right.  If/when I get another tattoo, I will make another weekend trip to Vegas just to have Donnie do it. Thanks Donnie!

I would highly recommend the drunken dragon noodles, but don't ask for them too hot!  Yummy!

Great Food! Really enjoyed the "Combo".  This is kinda take-out style, but does have tables.

I've been to Chase locations all over town.  This branch has the slowest service in town, in the drive thru.  People backing up and getting out of line is a common occurrence.  I would right now,  if there weren't 2 cars behind me. This is my third try at this location.  Never again

This was a fun experience.....assigned seating is nice.  I would like to try the D-Box seating for an action movie

Really wanted to order takeout,  as I've wanted to try this place since they opened...... But ended up ordering elsewhere as there is no readable menu posted.... Fail
