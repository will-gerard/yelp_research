My husband and I got food poisoning from here a couple years ago. I called to let them know and they did not even care. They just said we have not had anyone else tell us. I will never eat here again. Because of them I have not order Chinese food from anywhere since it happened. I have never been that sick in my life.

I love this place. I have been going to it since it first open. I had my first oyster there and love them.  Great service and great food! Huge menu that includes a sushi. They serve sough dough bread while you wait for your order. The have huge booths. They have great take home kid cups and a very nice kids menu that even comes with tattoos. The house wine is also pretty good. I highly recommend it.
