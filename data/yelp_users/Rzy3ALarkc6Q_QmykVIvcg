My 11 year old daughter and I tried Zoes Kitchen for dinner tonight and while expecting an ok cafe and hoping for a quick, decent meal, were pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food. I had the steak roll-ups entree and the rolls were delish! There was tons of flavor in the meat and veggies, the dip was great, and I loved the pasta salad side. My daughter had the chicken roll-ups kids meal and loved it. She tried one of my rolls as well and loved the steak roll-up dip...and ended up taking the rest of the cup of dip home because she loved it so much.   I will say the portions were satisfying for us, being smaller girls, but I can imagine that any male I know or someone with a big appetite might be disappointed in just getting one entree so the price point might be high if someone has to compensate for the small portions with extra sides or dishes.   We will definitely be back and I want to try the hummus next time along with some other dishes that looked tasty.

Myself and 2 girlfriends went to Claim Jumper last night for happy hour as the menu looked like a great value. I ordered a raspberry martini which tasted like nothing but syrup. Probably the weakest martini I have ever had. When we ordered our drinks we also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa. After the drinks came we ordered the meal. For our meal we ordered 3 plates of street tacos. 1 with fish, 1 with pork and 1 with half fish/half pork.   The waitress always seemed in a hurry. She would come to the table and as soon as one person made a request she would try to run off without asking anyone else. She got away a couple times so we had to wait to see her again and flag her down.   The tacos came out from the kitchen. It was not the waitress who brought them. They simply asked, who has the fish...who has the pork. So our other friend who ordered half/half didn't get a plate yet. And still no chips and salsa that we ordered initially. We have already been here 20-30 minutes. I also ordered the caesar salad which I assume should have come out first with the chips. We did flag down another person from the kitchen and asked about the additional plate of tacos, the chips and salsa, and my salad. He let us know that they put the other plate of tacos on the plates already served. No extra plate or info to this regard. Served in a way that sushi is where they put all the same type of roll on one plate. Did not expect this at Claim Jumper. They finally brought the chips and salsa. And I had 2 people bring me a salad. I obviously turned down the 2nd. Now we're up to 4 people trying to serve our table. Our waitress went MIA many times and it took another 15 minutes for my friend to order another drink.   The funniest part was the chips and salsa. There is a huge plate of chips and one tiny condiment sized bowl of salsa. No problem, we request more salsa. It's bottomless. So we ask for more salsa and ask for a larger bowl or multiple tiny cups. We finally get a bowl that has the optical illusion of being larger. But it doesn't look like much more salsa. So we test it out. Yes, the amount of salsa in the wide, shallow bowl fills the condiment sized tiny cup perfectly. Sooo...we see another kitchen person and flag them down and ask for a large/full bowl of salsa. So she finally brings that out. 5th person to help our table. Later on we still had chips left and could have used more salsa but it wasn't worth the effort to flag down another staff member.  In the end, the reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1 is that the food was actually pretty good. The fish tacos were very tasty, the salsa was good and fresh, and I was impressed with the $2 happy hour mini caesar salad that was served on a large plate and bigger than some lunch portion salads at other restaurants. It was the service that was lacking and it wasn't just the one waitress. It was the system they have in place where kitchen help, cooks, and wait staff are all running around a full dining room and you never know who is serving you and your main waitress isn't around much to check on the table.

My Pappadeaux experiences have been different every time. But the negative has outweighed the positive. On a first visit a couple years ago I went with a group of friends and our children. We enjoyed various appetizers of Shrimp and Crawfish Fondeaux, Calamari and Fried Alligator - which the kids got a kick out of trying for the first time. All was tasty. I ordered a plank salmon with grilled asparagus. No complaints. We did have a mighty tasty watermelon cocktail that was refreshing and strong.   A second visit was a little less desirable. I was meeting a friend for happy hour. It was late afternoon...about 4:30 and it was quite packed. I had my 11 year (at the time) old daughter with me but she was being picked up by a friend on the way home from work so I could enjoy an outing with a girlfriend. There was a wait to be seated and we wanted to sit at the bar anyways. There were a few chairs and we took a seat. I ordered a chocolate milk for my daughter and was told by the bartender, 'she's not allowed to sit in this area'. I said, 'Really? She's being picked up in 15 minutes anyways so it won't be long. She's sitting here.' Not to mention there was a table right NEXT to the bar behind us with 2 children at it. I'm sure he just didn't want the seat taken by a child and reduce his drink orders...but he was rude about it and I wasn't pleased. Almost wanted to leave. The rest of the visit was decent. Had a cocktail and appetizer with the girlfriend and then left. Bartender continued to NOT be friendly.   3rd trip was a date night and my first time trying oysters. We ordered an appetizer to start and then a dozen oysters that came out later. My date gave me tips on how to eat. I enjoyed the first one. 2nd one we both ate...had debris, shell fragments, sand or whatever else might be in the oysters that aren't properly cleaned. We ended up returning the oysters and leaving disappointed and still hungry.

I will be back for the Hot Buttered Rum cocktail for sure! Our group enjoyed a taste from the Punch Bowl and it was quite delicious. A pomegranate, black cherry, maple concoction was served and I was worried it might be too sweet but it packed a lot of flavor, and a good 'punch', haha! Sometimes a pre-mixed drink special at restaurants are either too sweet, watered down, or possibly even too strong. This one was delightful.   A couple in our group ordered a 2nd cocktail: Hot Buttered Rum. I enjoyed a sip and it was sooo good! On the next chilly night downtown I will be back to partake a glass or two.   I learned you can also enjoy a cigar here and I have to say I don't recall the place wreaking of cigar smoke so that's a plus if you're worried about leaving with a cigar smoke smell on your clothes.  Drinks were a bit pricey but the quality of what I tasted was great and I loved the ambiance. Dim lighting, chill, quiet. Perfect for a date night.

The first time I visited Postino, I went out of my comfort zone and ordered whatever seemed the most unique on the menu. This happened to be the Prosciutto with Brie Panini. Upon tasting, I was sold. Every visit since I've ordered this sandwich. I've noshed on some bruschetta that friends have ordered and those are always delightful, as well. But I just HAVE to get this sandwich. Even on my most recent brunch trip (although to the Arcadia location), I even got the panini for 'breakfast' rather than trying a brunch dish. I'm addicted!  The $5 pitchers and glasses of wine are a great deal. I love the outdoor patio with greenery and open to the inside. Such a delightful and friendly place!! :)

I've been here a handful of times and love their happy house specials. A LOT of specialty cocktails on happy hour and I was happy to learn that their weekend happy hour goes from 10:30 - 7pm...very rare to find a weekend happy hour! This is only for drinks, though. Food specials are only Monday-Friday. Every time I've been for a week night happy hour I make sure to get the mac and cheese. It's only $5 if I remember correctly. VERY rich, flavorful and comes out in a piping hot crock. I can usually only eat about 1/2 of it so it's also a decent sized serving!  I love drinks made with ginger beer (i.e. Moscow Mule) and they use Cock N Bull which is one of my favorite ginger brews.   I'll be back again and again and again. :)

My go to Central Phoenix hangout, Windsor has not disappointed. I love the decor, the crowd, the super friendly and professional staff and the #17! A cucumber, green tea and mint cocktail. I get one almost every time I visit...and I always try to visit during their half priced happy hours that go until 5pm, even on Saturdays. For a week night, it is kind of an odd ending time for a happy hour...no post work specials if you're working a 9-5.   I've only eaten here a couple times, and the last time I had the mac and cheese side dish. I'm a sucker for mac and cheese when I see it on any moderate to upscale menu. It was heavenly! Creamy, topped with bread crumbs and finished in the oven for a nice 'crust'.   I will continue to be a patron and every time I introduce friends to what Central Phoenix has to offer, Windsor is at the top of the list.

Copper Blues is one of my favorite Cityscape spots. A great venue for live music and great beer selection. Whenever I have a planned night out downtown I check the music calendar and if EastonAshe is in the house I make sure to stop in. They play here often and they're one of my favorite, rockin' Phoenix cover bands.   It can get crowded when the bands playing but the outdoor patio is usually a little less crowded so you can at least step out there to get away from the crowd, if needed.   We were offered penny pint tickets on the way in and that was a big score! I'm sure the bartenders love those deals as well. We definitely tip more when the drink is pretty much free! ;)

I've visited Crescent Ballroom for 3 concerts this year. Cold War Kids (twice!) and Blackalicious. All shows were great! The first CWK show was actually the carnivale electric event in the spring. Although it was outdoors and POURING rain the entire time, it was a great set up and a lot of fun was had.   The other 2 shows indoors were awesome, as well. Great sized, intimate venue that brings to town some great, indie acts. The crowd has always been great and I love that they have the bar area near the stage and the under age area up front for all ages shows. I took my daughter to see CWK the 2nd time and we got to be right up front without showing up 2 hours early!! :) She loved it, as did I...mainly because I wasn't watching in the rain this time around.   I will continue to check their schedule and hope to make one of their trivia nights or even just pop in for an impromptu concert some time. Who knows, I might find a great new act to follow!

This is becoming my favorite local sushi joint. I have been a handful of times and never had a bad experience. The owner is extremely generous and even gave us a free glass of beer at the end of the meal as a thank you for coming in on our last visit. I have seen him many times come out of the kitchen and greet the customers to make sure they are having a great dining experience.   The sushi is always fresh and they have a very nice selection of special rolls. I like that you receive a bowl of miso soup at the beginning of the meal at no charge. A great addition to the experience as I usually don't care to spend $3-4 on a bowl of broth at other sushi restaurants. And theirs is one of the best misos I've had. The wait staff is nice, friendly, and personable. I have been for week day dinners, late lunches and there's not usually more than 3-4 tables occupied. I think this has to do with the location and time of day that I visit, but I will spread the word and hope more sushi lovers will give it a try!

The 30+ minute wait was worth it! Packed place on the Saturday night I visited. I finally had a chance to check this place out with friends and was not disappointed. Granted, I only had one beer but it turned me onto what is now probably my favorite brew! I had a Lost Coast Brewery Tangerine Wheat. It had the perfect amount of citrus, was lighter on the tummy than say a Blue Moon or Shocktop; the typical Wheat beers that are available at most restaurants.   The temperature of the beer was perfect. Staff was very knowledgeable about the beer selection, which changes every day. Actually, after my glass of Tangerine Wheat, they had just ran out and replaced it on the giant chalk board display with a new wheat selection, it was called Heife WEISS Hell! My visit was complete or else I would have tried that one, too.   I did not eat on this visit but the food passing by for other tables looked delicious. I'll be back for some grub and possibly enjoy a flight next time so I can find my next favorite brew!

I've been to Nori twice and both times were impressed with the food and service. I enjoy the bright, green decor, staff is super friendly and we were even presented with $5 cards for a return visit. On one visit we had a couple specialty cocktails. I believe one was a strawberry mojito and it was quite delicious and not skimpy on the alcohol.   I've had edemame (free with yelp check-in), philly rolls and shared another roll with a friend. Everything was tasty and at the perfect temperature. I will be back when I am in the area and have a sushi craving.

ROC Race is now at the top of my obstacle course race list! Unlike similar races, this one spares the mud bath and although you still get a 'dirty' yet refreshing soak at the bottom of some slides and obstacles, the only thing to rinse off at the end is a thick coating of foam and bubbles...but then we were right back in the bubbles outside of the race where spectators and racers could play beneath a machine blowing this foam into the air and all over the ground where people were literally swimming or hiding under said foam.  The obstacles weren't too challenging.The only one that seemed almost impossible, 'big balls' was skipped by most. I tried it but immediately fell upon jumping onto the first ball. The slides and moon bounce were the most fun. The wrecking ball obstacle was the most anticipated challenge, I believe.   The emcee at the beginning of the race did a great job of getting everyone pumped and ready to run! And the emcee at the last obstacle, wrecking ball, was quite entertaining with his speedo and commentary.   We were VERY disappointed that we did not get a medal at the end of this race. I've collected bibs and medals from every obstacle run I've done and they were not passed out at the end of this race. And this one might have been the most I had paid for an obstacle course! I saw a few medals but heard they were only for the costume content, which we knew nothing about until it had ended. And we were all dressed up in 80s costume.   We enjoyed the cocktails and music post-race, as well. I would definitely do this race again and recruit more friends if I get the chance. It was a super fun time!
