Oh geeze I loathe this place. It smells like a sweaty swamp full of mold, yeast, day old balls and other unidentified bodily odors. The fluorescent lights blare while the instructors yawn and fan themselves with the list of asanas they repeat session after session ad nauseum. Did I mention it's also 100 degrees and 95 percent humidity in there? You will also huddle together as there is always a groupon bringing in the hordes. Don't worry, you will be able to see every inch of everyone's nearly naked body for only a few minutes as the mirrors quickly fog up with your collective sweat.

I have been going to A Desert Song for now over 16 years since it was at the 16th street location. The staff are very dedicated to their craft and will help anyone, at any level. I would recommend the intro series for the new students, or the basics class. The staff will get to know you by name, and personally help you. Even in a large class you may feel like you are having a private yoga session, especially with the owner Mary Beth. As others have mentioned, this place is truly a breath of fresh air in Phoenix. When I am tense all I need to do is go to yoga and it all washes away. If I need some deeper intervention, desert song is hands down the best place to get a massage in the valley. The practitioners can root out your stress and rub it all away. After a massage here I feel as if all of my stressors in life have magically disappeared. There's nothing that even comes close. They've ruined me for everything else.

They close early, doors were locked at 430 in a Wednesday when their sign says 5. I will update this if they are ever open.

I have been coming here for almost 20 years. I followed them from 7th ave. I still, and always will, know them as "Supreme Master." These people are the best, the first, the only true vegetarian Chinese/Vietnamese place in the valley (please let me know, yelpers, if there are more!). I've staged breakups here, and first dates. I had my 18 year old birthday party here. And my 30th. I didn't tell my relatives it was Vegan. They never asked.  In all of the cases, DO NOT UNDERORDER!  Through tears and heirs, order the extra mu shu. Don't forget the lemongrass chicken (an order per person), sizzling rice soup, and the New York charm. I have one rule here: always leave with leftovers. They usually don't make it to the fridge, let alone the next day. Oh, and take kick of religion in stride. Chopsticks optional.

I love amsterdam!  Nothing is better than the Sunday night Karaoke and the $5 martinis and manicures on Mondays.  It can definately get very crowded on the weekends so be prepared to wait for a drink.  Oh and Sam Adams Cheery Wheat is on tap.

I love this place! The delivery is fast and the food is delicious.  The delivery driver cracks me up! He can never seem to find our house even though he's been here a bunch of times, it's hilarious! I usually order the mu shu...get it! I'm a vegetarian so I add tofu to it, no problem. I also love their mixed vegetable and family style bean curd. They never have a problem altering things for me, and delivery is awesome! Get Sui Wok tonight!

This is a low budget high priced store. Superstore? Not really. They don't have a huge selection and then they direct you to their website. If I wanted to buy something online then I would have bought it online! They also have no return policy, which for a mostly online store, strikes me as a bad practice. The store itself is dusty and disheveled, with badly designed window units. David's Bridal seems high class compared to this. However, they do have a good clearance section. It's in the section of the store where the broken display items and torn signs are.

While it is hit or moss with the masseuse you get, and this isn't a review of them per say (although they did range from one star to three at best- and then when booking the second appointment with the good one they talk your ear off because they're soooo bored), the whole experience is definitely lackluster. Massage Envy is the Supercuts  of the massage world. Really. I got lured into  their "39$ a massage deal" like many others have before. Well...then you can't cancel unless it's in writing 30 days prior, and can't use the massages past the date of cancelation. The last 30 days of my membership I was cramming massages in left and right, but the whole experience is the opposite of relaxing, so those 20 days were just more stressful than anything else. I waited two months, saved up my money and went to Desert Song, where for a little more but no contract you can get a genuine massage. One with a person who is clued into what you need, experienced, and actually makes you feel better.

Just eat the drunken noodles and the peanut sauce. Just do it. I love this place, although I do agree that it isn't quite as good as it was a few years ago. It's still the best druken noodles and peanut sauce in my book.

This place is not good for vegetarians and don't really seem to want to work with you to make anything a healthy vegetarian option that's also tasty.  Beware! Most of their noodle dishes have fish sauce, chicken stock or the like. The server seemed annoyed that I even asked, and also said it wouldn't be possible to have a veggie protein in a salad. Their seitan was one note: salty. Better to try seasons 52 next door, which at least has some flavorful vegetarian options.

I have to preface this by saying that I'm a vegetarian so I may be slightly skewed in my review. Yes this is "comfort food" and I understand that doesn't mean healthy. However, the dish I ordered came out in a pool of grease.  The "baked eggplant"  tasted bland and oily, and all the while the bartender (we sat at the bar) kept raving about how delicious the food was. Hmmm not so much. We also had a salad, pretty good but small for the price, and an appetizer. This was the mixed rellenos which were a little better but missing...something.  My fiance had one of the rellenos with beef in it and he said it was grisly. All together, the bill came to over $80 for one salad, an appetizer and an entree, plus two drinks. I would come here for just wine but nothing more.

So I went in here today after the last "bridal salon" I went to was a complete and utter disaster. I normally wear a size 12 to 14 in "street wear" and don't have any problem buying clothes at normal stores, so I don't even consider myself plus sized. However, after the last place literally brought me to a panic, I bit the bullet and called Strut. Ann, the owner, was able to get me in last minute.  She was incredibly warm, asked me about which gowns i liked, and even pulled a few that I wouldn't have otherwise tried on. Guess what I fell in love! And with a dress I wouldn't have thought of. Who knew I had a waist? Ann did!  She was great, incredibly friendly and most of all, warm. She made me feel like a bride. I would definitely recommend this salon to anyone who has had a similar experience. I definitely felt no pressure to buy, but I just knew that dress was the one. Thanks Ann!

Meh. Tricolored chips? Really? Salsa? No taste except for spiciness. The $10 for the "Hand squeezed margarita" was money poorly spent for what was clearly a margarita made with a mix. The menu is sparse, with not too much of a selection and a la carte items starting at $7. The servers are clearly instructed to up sell, but we did appreciate the attention. The food came, and it was incredibly bland except for the one note punch of heat and the blanket of cheese on top. Two stars for the service, the tortilla and the portions, which are hearty. Overall, not worth the $42 for two people plus tip. Never again.

This studio is exactly what I had been looking for. The owner definitely puts you at ease. I will be coming back, and next time with my friends. If you were at all on the fence about getting a spray tan, just go ahead, glo!

So I was so excited to come in with my wedding party. She was unresponsive and didn't seem to even want the business. She doesn't do mobile, which is a little odd considering she stood to make hundreds of dollars. Luckily I found someone else who was a lot nicer, more professional and also did a good job.

Ok, so it's LA fitness. This is not a fancy gym, but for the price you really can't beat it. I, like many other posters before, go a little farther to avoid the 20th street one. Yes if you come on weekends and week nights it may be crowded.  However, I've never had to wait for a cardio machine so no complaints in that regard whatsoever. I've been to a few classes too, and now have experience with personal trainers, so I'll give my input on those. The good: I Love love love Katherine for cycle. I've been to spin studios and she seriously kicks butt. She had a sub a couple of weeks ago and I wanted to cry the whole time because Katherine is so much better. I also really love Cassandra for personal training.  She works me hard but knows how to modify the exercises. She's really nice and understands weight issues, injuries, etc.  She kicks butt! You can watch tv and charge your iPhone at every cardio machine! Woohoo! The bad: ugh I hate step class. I'm not sure if I really just hate the step class or if it was the instructor, but its boring. The ugly: My personal training assessment was not so good, mainly because of the kid who did it was not too sympathetic to my struggles, and said some things that sounded judgmental, ie "how long have you been overweight?" Me: my whole life. Him: "really, why? (In a snooty tone)" That's just one example. I feel with a little customer service skills that could have gone a lot better. High pressure sales, belittling don't usually work on me, and I had gone in there already deciding to sign up for personal training, so it wasn't necessary at all.

I though it was a little strange to have a business out of your house (let alone questionably legal- is that legal?), but it was even stranger waiting on a dirty porch with dying plants surrounding me and foil in the windows, thinking all the while I was going into a business. However, after a half an hour sitting on the porch past my appointment time, with no life from the shutters, I cut my losses and left. After several calls and texts, "lily" hasn't called me back concerning the missed appointment. Luckily I found someone who could take me last minute- and they look great! Maybe I dodged a bullet considering the other review?

So just an update, she did contact me and say that she had an unexpected death in the family, so hence the no communication.

I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it gets one star for the food alone. Maybe other things on the menu are better, but definitely steer away from the egg paninis. Maybe they ran out of ingredients? The vegetable one, which was supposed to have vegetables on it, had what seemed like less than an egg, one slice of tomato, 3 leaves of wilted spinach and some red onion. It was ALL greasy bread with no flavor (nothing really was inside of it). All that for $10. The service was good, but with so many other options in the area, why waste your hunger?

Wow. Jayd not only gave me what I needed for my wedding, she was able to accommodate us last minute and came to our house. She was completely professional, even when dealing with my crazy family! She also put my friends to ease since it was their first time. Also, she knows all of the hookups for beauty treatments in the valley, so trust her with those!!!!

I went here at their Central location a few years ago and loved it. The whole experience was like hanging out with some friends while getting pampered. I totally recommend it!
