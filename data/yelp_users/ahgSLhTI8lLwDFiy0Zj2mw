NOT A 24 HOUR STORE!! Even though it says so in Walmart.com... And I hate false advertising... Especially at 5:30 in the morning

Always such a great experience with Scottsdale Pet Hotel! I've been bringing my two dogs here for about a year now... I've had one of my dogs for almost 9 years and the first time I ever boarded her was about a year ago here. It was tough to leave her but now I'm so confident that she is really good hands!  The facility is clean, staff is super friendly, and the prices are really reasonable. They are always flexible if I am running a few minutes late or early for pick-up and drop off!  Thank you for making it a little easier to leave my dogs when we go out of town!

I recently moved to Arizona from the southeast. Patty has been amazing with our dog Wylie! I couldn't have asked for a better pet sitter and walker. She's extremely professional, truly loves your pet, and always reliable. Patty sends pictures and texts when she visits which really puts me at ease when we are gone overnight.   I would highly recommends her to anyone looking for a pet sitter who will love your dog as much as you do!

First time here and we will be back!! Awesome local beer selection and a majority of their food is sourced locally. Staff was so friendly!
