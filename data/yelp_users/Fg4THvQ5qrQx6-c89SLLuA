This comment is directed to the gentleman that works in your Phoenix Colonnade location in the Furniture section. (The really short 80's looking guy)..  Why in the world would be so condescending to customers and butt in on their conversation? Why did you feel the need to critisize their description of a chair they were looking at?  Because of your rude and flippant behavior, and obvious lack of customer service skills you lost an extremely large sale and any future business my wife and I would ever give you. That unfortunately includes the clothing side. we refuse to give business to people that treat customers so disrespectfully !

This could be my new nouveau mexican in this city. I went last night for my 1st time and was absolutely blown away.  Started out with the basic chips and guacamole. I think it may have been the best guacamole I have ever had.. Delicious !!  For my main course I had the POLLO RELLENO ( from menu: The house signature dish! chicken breast stuffed with poblano chiles, caramelized onion, corn and goat cheese finished with poblano cream sauce. paired with guajillo mashed potatoes, and vegetables)  IT WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD...  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the poblano cream sauce complimented everything on the plate. The veggies and potatoes were amazing too.  The crowd was mixed and there was a huge wedding party on the patio making it very lively.  the owner came over to the table a few times, and the waiter was top notch..  I will return and already know what I am gonna have !

I have been planning to try St. Francis for quite some time now and thought restaurant week would be the perfect opportunity.  I got to the restaurant on Sat. the 18th. It was the first night of the AZ restaurant Week. We arrived at 5:30pm. It was a perfect time to arrive as the restaurant started to fill up within about 45 minutes.  The restaurant had a prix fixe menu and the choices were great. I wish the price was always  $29 for a 3 course meal.  For my 1st course, I had the sweet corn soup. It was delicious. Not too sweet and very flavorful.  For the main course I opted to go with the Roasted Salmon w/ red quinoa, beets, avocado, soy beans & citrus. Incredible. The flavors all meshed together perfectly. I asked the waiter if it was possible to have my fish cooked med rare and to my delight it was perfect.  For my 3rd course, dessert I opted for the bananas foster. WOW !! Very  good. Also, since it was my birthday they gave me a complimentary sticky toffee pudding which I gladly shared with my dining companions.  Overall the dining experience was fantastic. Rob, our waiter was spot on. He took the time to give us the history and intentions of the restaurant and what a pleasure it was to have him as our server.

I have known Shane and Brandon for well over 15 years. Mastodon is as good a shop as there is. I have been getting tattooed by Brandon for years now and as far as I am concerned, there isn't a better artist in AZ. clean, professional and inviting is the best way to describe this shop...

The fact that Nick remembered my name and what I ordered only reinforced my decision to have dinner here tonight. The duck club is the best damn sandwich in town. A+ as usual!!!!
