If you come here to dine in close to closing time DO NOT sit in the back section or you will get scolded by the Latina hussie behind the counter.

This location is evil with an evil owner named John and a useless manager named Kimberley.  I would rather watch wallpaper dry tbs. have to deal with this store for anything!!!  This location needs to be shut down.

Bland taste for what this restaurant's reputation has in the neighborhood.  I was not impressed at all.  I had Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pork Fried Rice and Wonton Soup.  Nothing to write home about.  It didn't WOW me.  The rice was very sticky, the soup was very bland in richness and the Chicken had a Boneless Buffalo Wing texture to it.    Lucky Kitchen down the street is cheaper and is more authentic in taste.

There are many places to go for printing needs.  I was referred to Alphagraphics on Camelback from a co-worker.  I needed some posters and flyers printed for an upcoming fundraiser I am hosting.  The process was so smooth and easy from start to finish.  Dee Ann Mullins was a wonderful associate to do business with.  She gave me options, great ideas, and was helpful in making my decision.  The turn around time was 2 days.  They do everything here at Alphagraphics.  Make this location your "go-to" place for your printing needs.  I will be returning with more business.

This is my second visit to this store. Kimberly (the woman behind the counter) is the rudest person I have ever met in retail, who does not deserve to be behind the counter of any retail counter. She is cold, un-inviting, and overall appears to hate her job by the scour look on her face.  She is useless when it comes to helping customers and overall she has a "can't do" attitude.    I lodged a complaint on the corporate website and this store is privately franchised and owned.  I spoke with John the owner and apparently he must have trained Kimberly because his attitude is just as bad if not worse. He didn't show any concern for my complaint nor did he show any empathy for my experience.  He hung up on me twice in conversation.   Kimberly followed me out to the parking lot and show aggressive signs of intimidation with my friend and I and in my opinion that was inappropriate and unprofessional. A sales person NEVER follows a customer outside.   Avoid this store at all cost. The post office is around the corner and is much cheaper. I am fling a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.    Good luck John and Kimberly!!!

I see nothing has changed with this store. I just watched a ups store commercial and I laughed out loud!!  Kimberly (the brunette bitch behind the counter) is still the most evil woman walking on the planet.  I have more respect for the hookers on Van Buren Street than I do for this low class, snotty, unhelpful useless piece of trash!!  Stay away from this store at all cost!!!!

I have been going to this laundromat for about 5 years now.  It's great!  Water is always hot, and the dryers are always drying.  It's a laundromat people.  What more are you expecting?  $3.00 for a triple and $4.00 for a quad and you get a pre-wash and a regular wash?  Can't beat that.  Yes it's crowded on certain days of the week and certain times of the day, but there are many people out there who do not have the luxury of a home washer and dryer.  I get in and get out as best and as fast as I can.  I will go to the Firehouse subs or Filaberto's while I wait for my clothes to dry.  I have never had any issue with my clothes being tampered with or messed with.  They could use more carts but overall I think this is the best coin operated (what's left of them) laundromat in the city.  I will continue to go here.

Friendly and always fun to visit this store.  Despite the rage of the new iPhone 6, I was allowed into the store to "play" with the phones and check out the Apple TV.  Everyone here is so warm, inviting, and fun.  I would love to work here for Apple.  The energy in this store is right up my alley!!!!!

I think Bashir is one of the best barbers in town.  He's very professional. He shampoos your hair AFTER the haircut rather than before. What a concept??  Tammi Ming does a great job with eyebrows. She is the best.

For the most part this Fry's is the best store in the Fry's system; grocery wise. The pharmacy, however, is a living nightmare. Poor construction of how a pharmacy operates regarding curb appeal and ease of use. The pick up/consultation area is a horror to have to ensure. No clear separation of where the line begins and the waiting area is poorly designed. The drop off counter is the only valid position that works and that makes sense. The bakery is awesome and Sergio is the best employee in the entire store. He's very friendly and goes above and beyond!!!

This store has really gone down hill over the past few months with the loss of some key friendly employees. Service is average. The pharmacy is still a nightmare. It's sad because this is the most popular and busies frys in the system. I wish they would get it together back to the standards it has been "famous" for!!!

I've been coming here for years for service.  Overall they do good work. It's clean and reasonably priced.  Eyebrow wax is a good deal too. I got the new girl "Nancy".  She is very gentle and thorough. She actually speaks English and was making conversation with me. Thanks "Nancy".  Update post pedicure:  "NANCY" IS AWESOME!  The best pedicure I've ever had here!!  Go see her!!!  5 stars!!!

I've been coming here for years. I find this location to be a great place for a pedicure. Yesterday I made an appointment with my usual nail tech and when I arrived today the main girl Ann said "Kim no work here anymore". WHAT??  WHY wasn't I told this when I made my appointment??  I've been coming here for years!!  Very unprofessional and rude. They lost a customer.

This place rocks!!  I get my nostrils waxed once a month.  Sounds painful, but it is a good pain, like a tattoo.

I got my septum pierced by Jacob. He was very professional and had a good sense of humor, not to mention patience with my level of indecision.  Jacob is on the go to list if piercers. Very clean, and was gentle. Love my septum.  Can't wait to upgrade after it heals.

Well here is a UPS Store that actually is friendly and cares about its customers.  I can't foresee this one being owned by the one on highland avenue because it's clearly two different types of service. This store seems to care about its customers!!

I've been going here for a year and a half now with no complaints. It's clean, good parking, not a lot of intimidation, and no behind the scenes bullshit that you hear about the "other" gym down the street. It's simple, fees are accurate and up front. One request???  Cold water in the fountain???  Please??  The employee turnover is faster than the rotation of holidays. Why is there such a high turn over??

What are these "hidden fees" people keep talking about?  I was clearly made aware of all the fees when I signed up before I signed the dotted line and read all the fine print. So I am curious what the buzz is about?  This is a very nice gym.

Being that I am originally from the east coast, Boston, to be exact, where really good authentic Chinese food exists, I am a very picky snobby critic regarding Chinese food.    This is my first experience at Lucky Kitchen and I am proud to announce that I am giving it 5 stars.  I enjoyed what I think is the best Wonton Soup in town.  Yes, Wonton Soup.  Very boring and plain Wonton Soup.  However, this soup was very rich in flavor.  The broth was a hearty seasoned broth and not bland at all.  The cabbage/lettuce was delicious and I am not a fan of cooked cabbage/lettuce.  The Wontons were small yet filling.    I also tried the Pork Fried Rice.  It reminded me of back east Pork Fried Rice.  The rice was not sticky at all.  It was fluffy and the grains were separate and firm to the bite.  Great flavor and a generous amount of pork.    I will return again for another visit and try something else, but usually when I try something new, I stick to the same thing all of the time.  Decor and restaurant interior here was very traditional Chinese Take Away, but the food made up for the boring, decor.   I dined at a competitor's restaurant last week, China Chile, and they get 2 stars.  Lucky Kitchen is now my favorite Chinese Take Away in Phoenix.

JR is a very professional and expert barber!  I've been coming to him now for a few months and he has been the best barber I have encountered in Phoenix!  He takes his time making sure it's perfect when I leave.  He takes an hour to cut my hair and it is well worth the wait for the time and effort he put into it. He is the only barber who takes time to put effort into my beard too!  For $20.00 (haircut and beard trim) it is a bargain. I will continue to come back every two weeks!

Coming into this Starbucks is like having to remove an eyelash out of ones eye!  It's painful and irritating. The service is consistently SLOW and the service is "caddy and downright bitchy" from the barista side of the counter. 12 minutes to wait for an iced coffee. NO LIE OR EXAGGERATION. The store is laid out in a way that is confusing and wearing of the patience while waiting for a drink as there is mass chaos and confusion.  I know I have choice and other locations but this location is convenient to work and home and I try to go in each time with a glimmer of hope that it will be different but sadly it is not. Upper management needs to address the poor customer service and store layout.
