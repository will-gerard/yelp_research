Who does real time reviews?  This fuckin guy.  I'm at the Bikini Lounge, and it's so god damn baller that I pulled out my sweet ass iPhone and started typing.  I'm here with a bunch of yelpers, and I'm pretty sure they've all reviewed this place, so I know I'm just adding more stars to this joint.    When you live across the street from a bar, and not just any bar, the best dive bar on the planet, things can get dangerous.  But the fact that the fuckin ATM is always broken at this cash-only shithole keeps me from going completely bankrupt.  I'm surprised it hasn't been condemned, but that's probably cuz all the drunk ass people in here fight off OSHA with empty pitchers that used to contain delicious PBR.    Amber W. specifically asked me to mention the large group of over-the-top lesbians that are sitting in the booth next to us, so, yeah, they're here too.  And not shockingly, they're having a great time, cuz it's impossible not to here.    If you want friendly bartenders, get the fuck out.  If you want clean glasses, get the fuck out.  If you want bathrooms that don't have AIDS all over the place, get the fuck out.  But if you want a cold beer and a bunch of idiots dancing to a shitty song you've never heard, you've come to the right place.  Ok, since I'm still actually at the place I'm reviewing, I'd better order another PBR before this bartender kicks my ass.  Word to ya motha.

I'll be honest, I completely forgot Yelp existed.  Lots of my friends are Elite Yelpers, and since there haven't been many events over the past few months, their conversation topics have switched from "Oh my god the next OYE sounds fuckin awesome!" to "I haven't gotten any free food/drinks and Yelp branded schwag in forever waaahhhhhh!!!!"  So when I went to the UYE at The Vig Uptown last night with Georgie S, stuffed my face with cheap grub and Bud Lights, stuffed my pockets with lets just call it "a couple" Yelp coozies and packs of Orange-heads, I remembered this little website and figured I'd fill you in on what I've been eating since the last OYE.  God damn that was a long sentence.  KFC Double Down muthafuckas!!!!!!!  Yes, that's right, I've literally eaten KFC Double Downs for every meal for..... when did they come out?...... I don't know whenever they came out.  If you don't know what a Double Down is, then you obviously don't watch enough ESPN and other channels that target fat lazy dudes.  The KFC Double Down is the brainchild of what must be the fattest genius on Earth, designed specifically to trigger the glutton-reflex in the human brain.  Picture this: Take a delicious chicken sandwich from your favorite joint.  Put bacon and a sweet tangy sauce on it.  Hungry aren't ya?  But something is missing right?   NOW TAKE THOSE TWO PANSY ASS PIECES OF BREAD, THROW THAT SHIT BACK INTO THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW, AND SAY "GIMME ANOTHER PIECE OF CHICKEN BITCH!  You don't need bread!  Just put the freakin bacon and sauce IN BETWEEN the chicken filets!  You like grilled chicken?  Get grilled chicken.  You like fried chicken?  Get fried chicken.    Or you can follow in my Chicken Jesus-like footsteps and get one of each.  QUADRUPLE DOWN!!!  Seriously, I know most of you are all "GROSS!!" and thinking that I must be a raging alcoholic or constantly high to like this thing, but trust me, IT. IS. INCREDIBLE.  Eat a bunch of salads all week and tell yourself that you're healthy, go get a KFCDD, a 40 of OE, and sit on your ASS and enjoy the wonders of a true poultry masterpiece.    Plus you need protein homie, you're lookin a little flaco.  Yeah, you.  If you need me, I'll be in the drive thru.

Aw shit y'all done fucked up and let me in this bitch.   I hope there is some sort of Retweet-type function on Yelp and that every person that reads this RY's (Re-Yelps, hahha I fucking slay me) the fuck out of this review. I've never even patronized this place, so I'm sure true Yelpers are gonna find all sorts of wrong here, but I. don't. give. a. fuck.    First, I have eaten at Julio's Too, but the one in Tempe on that street by the stadium, BEFORE IT WENT OUT OF BUSINESS.  While I was waiting for whatever the fuck shitty thing I ordered, I ate some of their shitty chips and salsa, and I'm not gonna spray a bunch of unnecessary expletives about it like all the sentences you've already read; it was simply terrible salsa.  I don't remember if my shitty entree was shitty or not, but I'm pretty sure it was shitty.  I never went back, and it was like two blocks from my dorm.  So tonight, I pull into the Old Town area around 9 or so(I know, what the fuck was I doing in Old Town?!), and drive around a bit seeing if I can snag a street parking spot like I'm usually able to.  I'm no Chris Angel, David Blaine, David Copperfield, (just listed all magicians past and present that I am aware of), but most of the time I pull up right when some drunk ass is pulling out of their spot and I snag it, whilst talking shit to the person right behind me who no doubt then had to park in bumblefuck and then ride one of those pedi-cabs that always have strange motherufuggin drivers that like to talk about their collection of over 50 "My Buddy" and "Kid Sister" dolls each clothed in a time period of French History.  (the Kid Sister that lived in Versailles was kinda smokin).  But I digress.  I parked at Julio's Too at 9:00 p.m. on a Friday night in Old Town Scottsdale.  Yes, there was a sign posted in front of the spot that said:   "Restricted Parking Julio's Too Vehicle Towed at Violator's Expense"  SUCK MY MOTHERFUCKING DICK.  You seriously are that full of yourself that you think your giant parking lot should be strictly reserved for patrons of your shit ass burrito joint, when you know good and well that 999 of 1000 cars that drive by your shit ass burrito joint on Friday night are full of people that are going to one of 15 places around your shit ass burrito joint that are not your shit ass burrito joint??  So you are.  And you towed my truck from your lot.  When I got back there, I understood because your lot was slammed and people were pouring into your shit ass burrito joint.  Wait, no, that doesn't seem right actually.  Now that I think of it, THERE WERE NO MOTHERFUCKING CARS IN THE ENTIRE FUCKING PARKING LOT.  Yet, you still thought it best to call the tow company, which you are clearly having sex with, to come tow my car out of the one occupied space in your entire lot.  So now, instead of enjoying my weekend being broke and staying home reading books on the first weekend of NFL football like a loser, I am going to embarrass myself by borrowing money to get my vehicle out of the impound LIKE A TOTAL FUCKING LOSER.    Suck a dick Julio's Too.  And if you should arrive to find a brick thrown though your window with a note taped to it that reads: "FUCK YOU, YOU TOWED MY 2004 FORD F150 PICKUP THAT IS BLACK WITH TAN TRIM, AND HAS A SCRATCH ON THE FRONT RIGHT BUMPER FROM WHEN I "ACCIDENTALLY" HIT A BICYCLIST.", I can 99.999999% guarantee you that that note-brick was not tossed by my completely-content-after-writing-this-review hands.

So, this is my first review, and I've already got writer's block.  Im sitting here trying to think of witty and insightful things to say, but all I can come up with is "This place is super freakin good."  I live right around the corner, so my favorite part is the short drunk stumble I can embark on from my crib or Bikini Lounge, which I also spend an unreasonable amount of time at. (Bikini review almost certain to follow).  Since proximity is crucial to my lazy ass, no points deducted yet.  The second obstacle became apparent the first time I walked in, rockin a Cleveland Cavs shirt, which the owner who's from Detroit immediately began to hate on.  You see Cleveland and Detroit are in a constant heated battle for America's most ridiculed city, and we take it very seriously.  After a quick shit talking show, I realized how nice of a guy he actually was, and decided that I liked a little civic-pride in my food-obtaining.  It's a small joint, so there's usually two-max-three people in there and they make you feel like you walked in to their own homes for a nice meal.  Friendly, personable, and happy to see you.  Still at 5 stars.    Food: Pizza, sandwiches, salads, very basic.  Delicious.  All of it.  I've had pretty much everything available, and it's all tasted outstanding.  Not often do you walk in to a small pizza/sandwich shop in a random neighborhood and get a quality Fish n Chips for like 6 bucks.  The pizzas are unique and interesting, and almost all have toppings you wouldn't immediately think to combine on a pie.  You'll learn that I'm extremely easy to please when it comes to basic foods, but the taste and portions at Valley Pizza always make me walk back over there and give them a high five (or low five or fist bump or whatever you're currently into).    All in all, I've been to Valley Pizza about 15 times now, and I've never been dissatisfied.  I know giving something 5 stars on your first review sets a difficult precedent, but this is truly a hidden gem in a neighborhood known mostly for Bikini Lounge and the Grand Ave galleries.  (Also for the occasional bum fight in the parking lot across from Bikini which if I could review I would give ten stars).  Do yourself a favor and the next time youre in the mood for a pizza or a big-ass sandwich, give this place a shot.  And if you dont agree, I'm right around the corner and you can come tell me why.  I might jack you in the face, but my door's always open.

Old Town Scottsdale.  Sigh.  You have this mystique.  This notoriety.  There are people all over the country that have heard that you provide an amusement park's worth of entertainment, and you never, and I mean NEVER, fail to come up short of my expectations.  You're like that chick that I see all over the place that I can't fuckin wait to take out, and when I finally do I get home with no money, no dignity, and the bluer balls than a smurf on Viagra.  Then there's Pattie's.  AHHHHHH!!  PATTIE'S!!!  What the fuck are you doing in Old Town?!?  You're like Joe Montana in a room full of Matt Lienarts; so unbelievably awesome that you could literally walk up to every bar around you and punch them in the throat and everyone would just say, "It's Joe Montana, I have no problem with that.".    If you've never been to Pattie's, that's probably because you never knew it existed.  It's hidden amongst a bunch of goofy stores that still somehow succeed in selling that awful Turquoise jewelry that tourists love so much, and Schlotsky's Deli, king of the overpriced crap sandwich and half bag of chips combo, far far away from the rest of the bars that make me love to hate Old Town.  You can go trough the front door on 1st Ave, or if you're super sick of Scottsdale door guys like I am, you can use the back alley access, just look for the dumpster behind Chase Bank.  (There's no shithead door guy at Pattie's, just wanted to bring up how much I hate shithead Scottsdale door guys.)  The first thing you'll notice when you walk in is that, people are actually having a good time.  Laughing, smiling, conversing.  Not just standing around trying to look cool and hating on everyone else around them cuz they dont have the newest rhinestone-studded vest or Steve Madden boots or whatever the hell else is hip at Myst that weekend.  Next, you'll see the ping-pong tables, being used for either traditional pong, or everyone's favorite, Beer Pong.  There's also shuffleboard and Golden Tee, if you're instantly drawn to any competitive arena like I am.    Pattie's is a true dive bar, in that, it doesn't give a FUCK.  You want draft beer?  They don't have it.  Drink it out of a bottle and shut up.  (It's better from the bottle anyway).  It's smokey in certain parts, but that's negated by the fact that that area is an open courtyard, which rocks most of the year because you get the beautiful AZ weather in a bar.  Yeah, its a little hotter in the summer, and a little colder in the winter, but if you're at Pattie's you're no doubt slammed so you dont care.  What I love most about Pattie's is the people.  Everyone is welcome.  There are no guidelines, except  the willingness to have a good time.  You'll see anybody and everybody there, and they'll all have a smile on their face.  Cougars dancing with other cougars dancing with college kids dancing with old dudes dancing with nerds dancing with (insert the most random person you've ever seen at a bar here).    So if you find yourself at Axis-Radius wishing you had a noose around your neck, walk over to Pattie's grab a Bud Light bottle, and enjoy Old Town for once.

Now you all know I don't really write Yelp reviews except when I feel like being a complete jackass or showing off my brilliant writing skills, but for once, this is a legit review that I just had to do.  I had been putting off having dinner with a family friend that I haven't seen for nearly a decade for a while, and he finally conned me into it.  Hey, free dinner, I'll take it.    I've been to Hula's a few times, and it's a cool joint with a great patio.  I thought it would be a chill place to go chat and grub on tasty food.  However, it took about 3 seconds for me to realize that my friend was one of "those" people.  Ya know, 9000 special requests, never pleased with anything, and constantly changing their mind.  Basically, the dude that everyone just loves to be at a restaurant with.  A server's nightmare.  So as I'm sitting there trying not to smack him, it dawns on me that our waitress, Estelle, is handling this fool with as much grace as I've ever witnessed from a server........She was charming, funny, and when most servers would have tossed a drink in his face or spit on his burger, ok wait........  "Double baco-cheese, it's for a cop." "What does that mean, you're gonna spit in it now?" "Don't spit, in that cop's burger"  "I don't want a large Farva, I want a god damn liter of cola!"  Sorry couldn't resist the Super Troopers reference.  Basically, she was perfect.  When he wanted a bigger lemon wedge for his water, I almost murdered him, and the only thing that stopped me was her wink, smile, and promise to him that he was about to have the best lemon wedge of his life. The food was good, but the experience in general started out daunting and Estelle was a champion.    The next time you're headed to Hula's, I recommend that giant bowl of booze, and I also recommend checking for open tables in Estelle's section.
