These people are really friendly and helpful. Fast to complete my car and I did not feel ripped off. My Scooter is purrin down the street. And let's just say I get a lot of eyes lookin my way. Although I feel uncomfortable wearing a cowboy hat and a Vesba, I still love my ride. Thanks guys for fixing my man machine!

Hot bagels is so delicious. They have a lot of bagels to choose from. Bagels are best in the morning in my opinion. I believe they are best in the morning because of cream cheese. Cream cheese gives me the trots so I choose not to eat it. But I love all the gluten that Hot Bagels provides.

Barros has good ranch. Friendly staff. They should make a barros chorizo or banana smoothies. If they did I don't think the ranch would be good with banana smoothies. Great establishment.

Yogurtz is so good! Although this is not how you spell yogurt. Either way I love this place. Really chilli. They do not serve chilli but merely the temperature of the establishment. I love raspberries. Not so much raw but in yogurt. I wish yogurtz the best.

So last February I bought a couch for $1500. I was moving homes and they told me it would take 2-4 weeks to physically get the couch. No big deal. We weren't moving for a month. Well 9, no joke 9 weeks later we finally got the couch. Btw, every time I would call and see where my couch is they would put me on a direct line to a supervisor. The catch is you LITERALLY will not speak to a supervisor. They put you on a voicemail waiting call list. Personally I think this is cowardly. And it usually took 2-3 business days to finally reach me back.   Well after sitting on my floor for over a month I got the couch. Well now it's a few months later and my dog chewed one of the cushions (not their fault). So I called to see how much it costs to either have it fixed or to just fork up the money and pay for a new one. I know it would prob cost an arm or a leg but beats spending another 2k in a couch. Well can you guess what they said?!?!?   WE CANT HELP YOU. YOUR ONLY OPTION IS TO BUY A NEW COUCH.   BTW they do have a repair service but only if you buy the extended warranty. Well I didn't buy the extended warranty so I told them to charge me double. And of course they said I can not be helped.   THIS COMPANY SUCKS WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! BEWARE IF YOU SHOP HERE!! I hope they reach out to me.   I am a general manager for a company who does over 75 million a year. I would never treat my customers this way.

We had a work function at The cabin last night and their service and food is a 10!!!! I would recommend this place to anyone!! Service was so good the manager greeted us several times and even helped taking the food out. I met both owners Preston and Donavon and they were very inviting and you can tell they had pride in their establishment. The alcohol was great pricing. Not only that, the food was amazing. We WILL be going their for ALL our work functions in the future. Great job guys!!
