I absolutely love this place! My husband started it by getting my engagement ring here. It is absolutely beautiful! Amazing craftsmanship! When we bought our wedding  rings there it was just a wonderful experience. We still go in every once in a while to get the rings cleaned and they are always so great! It is pricey but worth it!

Last time we were here, we stopped for their ice cream, which is out of this world and we saw that they also had a delicious looking breakfast menu. We finally were able to make it out for breakfast, and it did not disappoint. On Friday and Saturday mornings they have an all you can eat biscuits and gravy and coffee, so we had to try it. The biscuits were delicious and the gravy was pretty good. We like our gravy a little spicier, but it was still good. We also had the It's Not Eggs Benedict, and that was amazing. They make it with their homemade english muffins and cheddar cheese sauce. Their coffee was also very good, much better than we had expected! I cannot wait to have it again. Then of course after breakfast we had to have some ice cream! You cannot come here without having the ice cream and it was delicious as ever!   The service is also always wonderful and so friendly. Also, all the patrons are friendly as well and we always have a good conversation with someone we meet there.

We had heard of this place ever since we moved downtown two years ago and we finally got to try it out. We walked there, but if you drive make sure you have some cash on you because the only parking is valet. It's free, but you'll want some money for a tip. We went at the perfect time, a weekday during brunch hour. If you go at any of the popular times to eat, expect a wait. The food is delicious. Definitely try the signature chicken and waffles, they are great. The chicken has a great seasoning and the waffles are thin and cinnamony. The omelets are huge and delicious! My only complaints are that it is way too loud inside and a but overpriced.

We went here a few weeks ago with a couple of friends who love this place. It was a good experience and we were very happy with the service and the food. My husband and I split the large fajitas and it was plenty of food! The meat was pretty good and it came out steaming hot, as you expect for fajitas. I currently have gestational diabetes so I was unable to try the chips, salsa, and margaritas, so next time we go I will definitely give those a try too. It was good Mexican food, but not something I would go out of my way for. If you are already in the area, then definitely stop by. Also, expect a wait.

I love this theatre. The first time my husband took me there as a surprise I was so impressed! The Cinema Suite are amazing. Each person has there own extremely comfortable recliner. I have had many meals here and the food is pretty good. The big bonus about this theatre is that they have alcohol! It is so fun to enjoy a beer or cocktail as you recline and watch a movie :) It is a bit more expensive than other theatres, but so very worth it! Especially for a treat.

This is a fun place to go when you just want to grab some grub, drink, and hang out. They are very accommodating when it comes to football, they make sure you get to watch the game you want to see:) I had the New Mexico burger, which was pretty good.

This was our second try at eating here. This place has a great location and I love pizza so we thought we would grab some dinner after a movie. The first time was pretty bad, the woman didn't know what to do with our coupon, so it took forever to order. We had a pitcher of beer (not a good selection on tap) and waited for our pizza. About twenty minutes later she brings some wings to our table because she completely forgot about our pizza. It was nice that she brought us some complimentary wings, but when the pizza finally came out it was burned and incredibly greasy.   We decided to give the place one more shot. The second time we got there and it was not busy at all, but it took a while before anyone came to the counter to take our order.  We ordered a couple of beers from the bottles they had on display only to find that they didn't have any and we were stuck with the two tap choices again. It took about 30 minutes to get our pizza. It looked like it was cooked well, but it was incredibly greasy again and the dough was rock hard. We will definitely not be going back.

We stopped in here after a movie one night and it was a fun little find. We just wanted to grab a beer and have an appetizer. We got their chicken fingers, which were very good and hit the spot. The best part though was finding that they have hop knot! Maybe the only place downtown that does now;) We will definitely be going back.

I had heard about this place multiple times and I finally got a chance to check it out. I totally understood what everyone was raving about! This is such a great spot. I had a burger and it was excellent. Plus, you cannot beat the prices! It is a total steal. It does get busy, so I would definitely hit it right before or after the lunch rush. There is also not much space to eat inside, only a few tables, so be prepared to take it to go.

This is a great spot in northern downtown Phoenix. We often go here when central downtown is packed. It has a great atmosphere, good food, and a really great beer selection. They also have free wifi, which is a huge plus! This is a great location to watch a football game or catch up with friends. My only complaint is that not all the seats are all that comfortable. In regards to their food, everything we have tried has been very good. They have some of the best chicken tenders around and their burgers are delicious. I definitely recommend this place.

We had been here once before and were not very impressed with any of their beers, but we decided to give them another try when we saw a good groupon deal pop up. Unfortunately we didn't get to see if they had improved at all because in the interim we had a son and they do not allow children in their establishment and they asked us to leave. I have never been to a brewery that doesn't allow children, much less told point blank that the owner doesn't want children there. If the owner doesn't want family money we have no problem taking it elsewhere and never drink a sleepy dog beer again. There are plenty of other great local breweries to support.

We had heard that this place was great, so we decided to give it a try. I ordered an iced mocha, which was done pretty quickly and it was quite good.  My husband on the other hand enjoys brewed coffee.  They do it differently here and you can't just order a large coffee.  He tried to ask some questions of the staff, but the woman was less than helpful. She answered very minimally in a way that was not helpful at all and we were even more confused. She acted a little annoyed that we were not coffee connoisseurs and had to ask questions. After all that, our bill was $11 for two coffees! And their brewed coffee was pretty disgusting.  They also do not have great seating for a coffee shop.

I received a gift card here for my birthday and decided to get a pedicure. It was wonderful! This is a great small local business in downtown Phoenix. It is located in an old house at 6th St and Roosevelt and it has great character. It feels so comfortable inside and very relaxing. The staff were all extremely friendly and I had a great time. Courtney did a great job on my pedicure, it turned out beautifully! I think I will definitely try getting my hair done there next time as well.

I love this fast food restaurant.  Their burgers are always good and taste fresher than most fast food joints.  Their fries and cheese curds are also quite tasty.  The absolute best thing here though is their concrete mixers.  They are so delicious!

We frequent here during football season. It is a nice location just outside of the mall and it is right next to the movie theatre as well, which is nice. Their wings are delicious and they have so many flavors to choose from. They also have a good beer selection and this location has Hop Knot on tap! They have some pretty good food as well, just not too many low carb options. The service is hit or miss, some days it is great, others it is not. This past visit was great and she was very quick for us, we were in a bit of a hurry to catch a movie. It can be quite busy there during football season, so be sure to get there early if you want to get a table in view of the game you want to watch.

We love going to The Duce. It is one of the most unique bars you will ever visit. We live near it and always take our friends and family here whenever they are in town. They have great old fashioned drinks and beers here.  Their food is also pretty good, and one of these days I am going to try their ice cream.  The only thing is that they are pretty expensive. The drinks average around $10 for the cocktails, but they will literally squeeze the juice for the drinks in front of you! They are absolutely delicious. Also, we always walk, but I believe they only have valet parking. There is plenty of parking throughout the downtown area in easy walking distance. Definitely stop in here if you find yourself in downtown Phoenix!

We enjoyed trying out this small brewery in Phoenix, AZ. Their flight is great and gives you a great sampling of all their signature beers.  We especially enjoyed trying pints of their seasonals after that.  They almost always seem to have great groupon deals and such for tours. There is no food, but they often have small bagged snacks on hand.  Always a great way to spend an hour or two!

We decided to make our way here for Sunday brunch and try out their food. We had been here once before for an afternoon coffee and hadn't been too impressed with the coffee or atmosphere, but we wanted to give their food a try. We are so glad we did, their food is delicious! We had their biscuits and gravy, breakfast burrito with chorizo, a brown sugar and cinnamon crepe, and a pancake for our son. All were amazing and scrumptious. They are large portions and you will not leave hungry. The burrito was full of goodness and the salsa on the side was nice and spicy and a little went s long way. The biscuits and gravy were different but good. And our 7 month old loved the pancake. It was so fluffy and perfectly cooked.  Here are the reasons they are only getting 4 stars and not five: ~Customer service was not great. I don't know if they were overwhelmed, but they had an attitude and I did not feel welcome.  ~ Coffee is not amazing. When their main product is coffee I really want to be blown away and I wasn't. The cold brew was average, it did have a lot of flavor though. Their drip. Offer was just really weak.  ~ They have a great outdoor space, but it is ruined by all the smokers.

This place is great and one of our typical stops on the weekend.  One great thing about them is that they have live music every weekend! They are almost always great bands.  They also have an amazing beer selection of over 60 beers on tap! The only thing that really brings it down to a four star is that it can get a bit expensive! Their beers generally range from $5-8 and only some local beers apply to happy hour. Their Happy hour is from 3-6, with great deals on their appetizers and pizzas. Their food is also delicious! Try the nachos.

Humble Pie is a great restaurant that has several locations throughout the valley. We love to come here for happy hour because they have some great deals. They have food deals from 3pm-6pm and drink deals from 11am-6pm. We have tried a lot of their food and have never been disappointed. The only reason that I am giving it four stars  instead of five is because of service. The service is really hit or miss. Sometimes is great and other times it is awful. Our visit in January was one of the awful ones and I think it was due to being a bit understaffed on their kids eat free day, but when it takes an hour to get your check and pay it, that is just too much. We also only saw our waiter a handful of times and often had empty drinks. Past visits we have had better service, but it is never a guarantee here.

This is a great spot in downtown Phoenix. I get their Black and Blue burger almost every  time with their house made chips and it is a pretty tasty meal. They also have a pretty good beer selection, especially now that they have Four Peaks Hop Knot back. The bartenders there are great, especially Carl, Renee, and Kari. I would recommend sitting at the bar over a table. We have yet to have a good experience with a waitress there. They just tend to be slow and forget about you. Also, be prepared for the women's uniforms, they are a little bit revealing. Just something to know if you have kids.

This is a great local brewery in Phoenix, AZ. Some of their beers are easy to find in bars throughout the state, but for the others you have to go to the tap room. Plus, beers always taste better from the source! We really enjoyed this trip. The staff were super nice and helpful and they give you free pretzels with your drinks. Try a flight to get a good taste of all their different beers.

This is a fun place to hit when you are in the Tempe Marketplace. They have a huge selection of beers on tap and there is something for everyone. This past visit, we just had drinks and the bartender was super nice and attentive. Previous visits we have eaten there and they have pretty good food. They also have a great happy hour. I would definitely recommend this place for drinks or meals.

My husband and I frequent this breakfast spot and we absolutely love it. Their food is delicious and has been every time we have been there. The only thing that seems to change from visit to visit is the service and the coffee. Some days the service and coffee are great and other days it is not. Honestly though, the food definitely makes up for it. Also, we have not tried their espresso coffees, only the drip coffees. So far we are stuck on two dishes because they are amazing: the biscuits and gravy and the border bowl. We highly recommend both of them, everything on the menu looks great though. The service has mostly been good. We are always seated right away and the staff are always friendly. Usually your water and coffee stays pretty full because everyone seems to help out with replenishing most days. This is a great spot for breakfast or brunch! They have indoor or outdoor seating and the atmosphere is very relaxing and nice. It is a little expensive, but that is the norm for everywhere downtown.

I had heard that this was a great breakfast spot and it did not disappoint. We went on a Friday morning and it wasn't busy at all and was easy to get a nice table outside for our entire group. You order at the counter and they then deliver your food to you. I had the biscuits and gravy and they were delicious. The biscuits were not my favorite, but they were good, and the gravy was wonderful! I also tried their Japanese Cold Brewed coffee which was very different, but really good. I will definitely be going back!

My husband and I love this place. It has an amazing beer selection and it is new every time. They currently have 31 beers on tap! They also have 6 wines on tap. All the food we have had has been really good. Their pizza is great! The only reason I give it a 4 star is because they don't have a happy hour and it is pretty pricey.

We hit this place on our way to a play at Gammage.  It had a great selection of local beers and all of the food we tried was excellent and very filling. We will definitely be back. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, just watch for the flys in the outdoor area. They also have a fairly good happy hour.

I had heard how amazing this place was and had been avoiding it because it often has a very long wait. We decided to try it on my birthday for breakfast and was so glad that we did! We got seated right away and they served us a great cup of coffee quickly. They also had eggs Benedict as the special that day, which is my favorite! It was wonderful! The service and food was great. I cannot wait to go back!!

We stopped in here on our walk home, there was a bit of a wait, but it was worth it. I had wanted to try them for a while, but had to watch my sugar intake. I am now able to occasionally cheat, and glad I did on this! They have a ton of flavors that frequently change. It was so hard to decide on which one to get. My husband and I decided to share a double. We got hot fudge brownie and bourbon toffee! They were both delicious and worth every calorie ;) I will definitely go back the next time I am in search of a sweet fix. They also have waffle ice cream sandwiches, which sound amazing. Also, the service was great. We came in when there was a bit of a rush and only one girl was working. She handled it well and efficiently, with a smile.

We stopped in here for the first time on First Friday, so it was quite busy, but that is to be expected. We just got drinks, but perused the food menu as well. They have a wonderful beer selection with lots of IPAs. The bartender was very good and attentive. Their food looks excellent and we are a fan of the food truck, it just strikes me as a little expensive for hot dogs. We will definitely go back to try the food soon though.

We tried this place for breakfast this past weekend because we had heard about it from several people.  It was pretty good.  We only had to wait five minutes for a table on a Sunday morning, which was not bad at all. The service was great the entire time. Always had our water and coffee glasses full.  The food was just okay.  We had their Eggs Benedict, I was not a fan of the ham, but the rest was pretty good. Their breakfast burrito was alright, just too many potatoes, which made it really dry. Their biscuits were delicious, but the chorizo gravy was just okay.

Rejected...!! :/ Walking in on a Friday eventing with 80% tables empty and they somehow didn't have a table for us. A group of 3 women walked in before us and got a table right away. No option to wait, just asked to leave. Don't know if we'll try to give this place a second try...

This is seriously the best pizza I have had anywhere during my entire life. It is utterly delicious. The location is great, right downtown near all of the sports arenas. It is a perfect spot to grab a bite to eat before a game or a show. It has a great atmosphere and very nice and informative staff. We have had the margharita and Italian Stallion, both were amazing and cooked perfectly in their brick oven. One of my absolute favorite things here are their desserts. I have heard that their house made tirimisu is amazing, but we tend to eat late and it has been sold out. So we have had their house made cheesecake each time and it is the best cheesecake I have ever had. I highly recommend everything about this place. A must hit in downtown Phoenix!

Since they opened, we have not eaten or grabbed drinks at any other place in Terminal 4. We generally fly out of the opposite side of the terminal from this place, it it is definitely worth the walk and getting there earlier! The food is excellent, great breakfast options too. You also can not beat the beer, which is the best that the Phoenix metro area has to offer!

We had heard of a new brewery in the area and wanted to check it out. We did not find the one we were looking for, but we happened upon this one and we were so happy that we did. It is located in a quiet area that I would never think of to look for a brewery. We walked in and were greeted right away by the bartender and the owner.  They were both really friendly and extremely helpful. We started with one flight of 4 beers for $8 and those beers were so good that we had to get another flight to try some more, then the owner threw in the one beer we didn't get to try with the flights. Such a nice gesture! And to our surprise, all of their 9 beers on tap were excellent!! Usually there is one or two at any brewery that are not good, but we really enjoyed them all. It was so difficult to pick which one we wanted to get a pint of! Definitely check this place out. All their beer is great! Definitely try the Haboob Black IPA! We did not try any of their food, but it looked pretty good.

I had been wanting to check out this new brewery since it opened, but I honestly had not been in a hurry because at first they did not have any of their own beers, but they have been slowly adding to it. We finally made it in and they had ten of their own beers! A great improvement and added to our excitement of stopping in there to try it out. We only got wings to eat because their food is quite expensive. It was weird that that was one of the only normal appetizers on their menu, most of it was a bit out there and we were not really interested in any of it. The wings were good and had a nice spicy kick to them and the house made ranch was delicious. In regards to their beers, they were all at least average and a few were quite good. We particularly enjoyed the IPA and Marzen that they had on tap. They also had a great selection of guest taps. I look forward to seeing what this brewery does and its continued foray into various brews. Also, our service was great. Our server was extremely friendly and upbeat.

To be honest, the two stars are for the decor of the brewery and restaurant. Our experience there was fairly awful. We went on a Sunday around 5:30. It was very busy and we had to wait for a table, which was fine. They told us 15 and it ended up being closer to 30-35 minutes. We grabbed a beer at the bar and walked around until they had a table available. Once we finally got a table (one that had been empty for at least 15 minutes before they cleaned it) it took at least 15 minutes, maybe more, before anyone came to the table. We were about to get up and leave. The experience I've described so far is basically how the rest of our meal went. We saw our server a handful of times, the food was okay, and the beer was subpar. We had a two flights and tried every single one of their beers and were unfortunately none wowed us. A lot of them were pretty good, but just had no wow factor.   We make a point to try any new brewery we come across and this one was just very disappointing. They get points for the decor, cleanliness, and nice staff, but they have a lot they need to work on! We do not live close, so it is very unlikely we will ever give this place another try.

This was our third visit to this amazing donut and chicken restaurant. It is not in the most convenient location, but it is definitely worth finding it! We always wait to go till after 10:30am so we can also get their amazing chicken. We tend to get 3 donuts and a chicken combo for the two of us and split everything. They always have a wide variety of delicious looking donuts and it is so hard to decide which ones we are going to get. With the chicken, it is just superb, and so far we have only tried their Korean chili. We tried it the first time and it was so amazing that we wanted it again! Next time we will have to try one of the other sauces that I am sure are just as delicious. They have quite a few booths inside that always clear up by the time you order and get your drinks and donuts. They also have great outdoor seating. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Oh, and their coffee is delicious as well (both the hot and cold brew)!

We had heard about this place for months and it lived up to the hype. They have a ton of great selections of beer and wine to take home. They have several options on tap to fill up bombers or growlers. Besides that, they have hundreds of beer options with everything from bombers to six packs. It was so hard to make a decision and we look forward to returning and picking out some more great brews! It is expensive and the total adds up very quickly, but they have beers you won't find anywhere else downtown. I highly recommend a stop in here, even just to check it out. Also, a big bonus is the great and friendly service.

Absolutely love this new coffee shop in downtown Phoenix! They have only been open a few days and already have it down. I had both their iced tea and an iced latte. Both were delicious. They have a good variety of drinks and snacks. What puts this place over the top is that it is somewhere for everybody! It is not only relaxing and perfect for adults, but it is family friendly! This is so unique and impossible to find, especially downtown. They have a kids corner inside and in the back they have an entire playground with toys and a beautiful grassy area with a big tree that provides lots of shade! This is a place that my husband, son, and I can all enjoy together. It is also somewhere I would go on my own or meet someone at for a business meeting. I cannot wait to go back. The staff (may have been the owners, not sure) were so friendly and helpful.
