First let me start by saying the doctor is great. The girls that work the front desk are lacking in the costumer service department. This is something that really needs to be worked on. Also I would say not a great place to take kids they just don't have good bedside manner to be able to communicate well with them. Agin I exclude the eye doctor from this statement. He is a young guy and I think of he just took change of the people he works with the office could be great!

Update on my last review. When I was seen I was seen for glasses and contacts. I decided to switch brands of contacts and when you do you need to be finalized after a few days to make sure you like them and they are sitting correctly in your eye. Being that I decided not to go back do to the poor horrible client service, I didn't make the appointment to finalize. A week later I received a statement from my insurance stating they have paid for the contacts? Wait paid for contacts? I didn't receive contacts! I never went back! So I called nation wide and the receptionist explained that they preorder them so they are ready for you to pick up when you finalize. So I was trapped into going to the appointment knowing my insurance would only cover what they already paid for. So reluctantly I made the appointment. I went to my appointment and had my contacts finalized and low and behold they had to order them!!!!!!!!?????? What the???? I had to wait another week for contacts that I was told they already ordered and my insurance and paid for.  I will never go back and I really hope they get it together!

My family has been coming here for a year now. Every time we walk in they know exactly who we are are greet us by name. They have such a great manner with children. The who office makes coming to the dentist a truly wonderful and comfortable experience. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Their appointments fill up fast but if your flexible they can get you in on short notice if they have a cancellation.

Wonderful staff and great service! Willing to take the time and help find just the rite dress. The only downfall and has nothing to with the store or service just the company it's self is David's bridals does sell your information. So be prepared to be spammed by phone by email and the post. I was married in April and I'm still getting spam.  All the spam Is the only reason I am giving the company a 4 star rating.

I've been looking for a good family doctor for a few years and I finally found it in this office. Dr. Smith is great he really takes his time and you can tell he truly cares. They offer allot of services in office even minor surgical procedures and blood work. Staff is friendly and the wait time is minimal.

Well..I unfortunately need to update my review. Dr. Smith is no longer practicing and the office was bought out.   I took a chance and went to see one of the new doctors. My appointment time was at 11:00 am and I waited in the waiting room for over 1 1/2 hours. asked the front desk manager what was going on with my appointment time and she said that they have a new system and working out the bugs.   I was finally taken back to the office. Doctor saw me for all of 10 minutes, I have a lump in my breast that is painful and turning my skin red. After she looked at it she said she "thinks it may be a infection" gave me a shot of antibiotics and told me to go to the ER if it gets worse! The last thing a woman wants to feel, is brushed off when we are dealing with a lump in this area.   I spoke with the nurse and told her my feelings and she said she would speak with the doctor, but nothing came of it. No test where done to find out if in fact it is an infection.   I will be finding a new doctor and getting a second opinion. Worst experience ever. The practice is no longer a caring practice but a corporate company that obviously only cares how many people they can see on a day to make more money if insurance. I will also be filing a grievance with my insurance company. No reason they should have to pay for such poor care.
