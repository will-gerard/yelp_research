I knew I was in the right place when... I spied a quote taped to the wall about the invaluable price of honesty and quality.  I knew I was in the right place when... at least eight certificates of completion by their employees and owners lined the top of the office walls.  I knew I was in the right place when... I saw their love of BMW's evident in the racing team they sponsor.  I knew I was in the right place when... I explained my psychotic attachment to the car and Ken was kind enough to talk me through their repair procedure.   I knew I was in the right place when... I was given a ride back to my house by the OWNER (30+ years) who flies around the country to learn new things about the cars he services. LOVE the flag detailing on the company (aka HIS) car!  Look I'll be honest, the shop isn't sleek like a dealer's and I find that comforting.*  It means they put their efforts under the hoods of the cars they service rather than in upscale sofas, noshes and newspapers.   These guys take pride in what they do. One trip and I'm in love.  I will never go back to Chapman BMW on Camelback when I can have excellence, pride, quality and affordability from Ken and the team at Bavarian Motors.  *For the record it's not a pig stye. it's homey and comfortable... Like a family's refrigerator with the kids' drawings and good grades on it.

I hit something on the freeway on-ramp and lost power. The second call I made was to Bavarian informing them I was coming in on a flat bed. AAA towing rocked and I eas there in no time.  Andrew called and told me what the problem was and its cost. I asked if its possible to add oil change and engine mounts. We'd discussed mounts at the last visit, there was a wear mark on an pipe.  I was expecting at least another day to get my car fixed.   It took about 38 hours from accident time to fix plus adding in extra repairs to get my car back.  And affordable for BMW!  Bavarian Motors... you rock my face off!!!

4th gluten free pizza - do not order this option.   The crust was burnt, the buffalo mozzarella was melted but not browned and the sausage was swimming betwixt the sauce and cheese.  I've ordered the soy cheese and soy sausage three times - once was it made well.  I'm not a fan of so-called real pizza and I'll bet the traditional pizza there is good. BUT If a restaurant charges these higher price for gluten & soy options (of which I'll pay) - you'd better do them at a C level not D-.  4th time is not and nor will be the charm for these options. Do yourself & customers a favor and take them off the menu.

Love love love this place. And this is several classes in; after THE WORST YOGA EXPERIENCE EVER* at Phoenix Bikram on Camelback and Central. Which is 5 minutes away, and I happily drive  40 to Tempe for Bikram Yoga on Guadalupe and McClintock.   Serious hot yoga seeking folks-incredible experience. I was very leery due due my experience with "Robert" at Bikram aka "Dic-kram" at Phoenix Bikram. But I am totally blissfully loving Tempe.   Only place to go, since Dawn at Hot Yoga (16th st & Bethany) passed away. Namaste Dawn, you are missed. I was shocked to read of your passing. Thank you for the classes.

Possibly the worst customer service I've ever experienced in the Valley.  I had to pick up a prop from this particular store, the salesgirl was not only COMPLETELY uninterested in helping me find the item I asked to be put aside (which wasn't), but when it was time to pay I was pushed aside so she could assist her friend first.  I am 100% about helping local buisnesses however in the case of Dee's disappointing Dancewear? Never again will they get my dollars.  Order your products online or go to a Capizio store.  Either way you'd get better service at Wal-Mart than at Dee's.

Loved the bar at the rooftop! I wish it had a bit more to offer in terms of cocktails (I went through 3 before getting one he had the makings for.) Lovely views!   I really enjoyed the tribute to Don Bolles. I knew the story but didn't really remember where it happened.   http://www.ire.org/about/history/  Looking forward to my next visit there, especially the downstairs bar.

I don't remember the service - aside from the pregnant waitress, the food or the beer.  I do remember looking at all the ladies in the bar area wondering why the HELL they were dressed to the slut-acular 9's.   Then it hit me: they're trying to pick up the guys who can't make it with the waitresses.  Clever, and a little sad... and that makes for awesome AWESOME awesome people viewing! It's sooo much better than the airport!!!

I'm not much for going out. But I LOVE SideBar. And I always have to ask myself why.  It's overpriced, the food is meh, BUT...  The bizarro movies on the screens ROCK! I'm either trying to figure out what's going on or what the name is so I can watch it later.  And most important, the men who go there are GORGEOUS in both personality and physical appearance. I'm quite shy but somehow I end up chatting with someone for a couple of hours when I'm there. That's without the alleged benefit of Dutch courage.  Easily a place to go where I can grab a nice drink by myself and either not be bothered or be bothered... depending on my mood.

Love this place! Awesome teacher and a great burn. Only drawbacks: its a bit hard to hear the instructor and I wish it was a bit cheaper.

REVISION: First of all, thank you Zuzanna for offering a refund. I have bumped up the experience one star for that offer.   Second, my review was removed by Yelp. So I shall repost:  I went here for about 18 months on and off. Major love that faded as good teachers went away.  I adored Kat's 5:30 Fri class. But that's gone. It was also the main reason I re-upped twice with the studio.  6 p Wednesdays features a 'mean girl yoga teacher,' S is not "all welcoming" You'd better be invited on her 4:30 Saturday or pay the interrogational price tag.  The class alienates anyone who is not in her posse but wants to give it a shot as it fits into the schedule. Your heart does not matter to her, only the amount of Lululemon on your bod.  I took a Monday class that was an experience into the male yoga Bro-ohm-mance culture. Example the instructor, Mr T,  response of, "that's what SHE said" to a fellow female instructor, commenting on the hot temperature of the room, is never appropriate in a yoga studio. Perhaps a bar out with the guys on a Saturday night, but not a Yoga studio. Bonus- he was the only male there.   For the record, looming over a person in savansana (sp) so that she thinks she's in Father BadTouch's clutches again is not going to gain  a second visit to your class.   Perhaps the "JESUS CHRIST" I screamed at a blurry (my glasses were off) looming creepy face, made an impression. I hope this yoga instructor has eliminated that from his practice.   Also,the instructor had students pull every single prop out, then we didn't use all them all plus he gave a zen practice when the website promises flow. I want my $ and 90 minutes back. I'll cut the male instructor slack on the prop pull as it was his first class, but inappropriate Bro-bar talk should never be excused   I also had a bad Zen practice (that I specifically went for) with another instructor but that's more me than her.

Awesome coffee, incredible sweets. Nice, quiet and just around the corner.  I'd humbly ask for more power outlets for us home office types who need a getaway spot!

Great prices! My favorite scotch was $5 less than Costco. Good selection of scotches too. Single malt & blends.  Can't tell you about wine as I spent my money on... Scotch!!! (what a shock!)

First timer here! Holy shit does your service suck!  Not only did your idiot server not understand, "double vodka with a shot of olive juice and then add some olives"  Her response, "oh thats like #6939845"  No. I want a double vodka with olive juice and olives. Its like a martini without ice.  What am i served? A martini, by a white jacketed lady, not the forearm two-tatted amoebic idiot who f'd up the order. Ok fine. Not what I wanted but it will do.  What will not do and is not fine- ignoring me as you ask the rest of the table about food, second drinks and taking away empties.   And $13 for ceviche with 3 pieces of fish is robbery. Tasty but wallet rape robbery.  I would have said this but hey, ignored! And ps overenthusiastic douche, glad our 'man' figured out the tab for you-trim your happy by 30% 'cause its annoying as fuck.  Enjoy your measly 18% tip.  Your customer service needs work. Sincerely - a chronic over tipper so your ass really sucks!!

I absolutely love this place, Mayo is awesome.  Prices are sliding $15-30 so you can afford to go as much as you need to.  First timers - there is a $10 set up fee.  The online appointment maker thing is very easy to use. I came in for help with my back and insomnia. Insomnia has been a slow nut to crack but the back I typically see immediate results.

Went there with some friends Nov 16th because their Facebook said it was open. We didn't seeing the big "private party-open Nov 18th" outside. Got the big 'no service' polite hustle out even after pulling up the Facebook page and showing the owner the green "open" on FB. Very sloppy planning!!   Owner reluctantly gave us a $5 chip after that. I gave it to one of my friends that night and I live 2 blocks away. I remember when this was a Korean Methodist church.  Decor: cheap looking 'Christopher Columbus' italian border on the former church's inside. Big plasma tv sets by bar. Bad use of such a amazing space!  Food: friend noticed only soft tacos on menu, no hard. My espn says the goal of this is makin $ not good food.

Great classes and instructors! They were so nice when I missed out on a class on my first free week-they reset the freebie!   The pilates classes get full FAST so reserve well ahead. The only thing I really don't like is the 6 hour cancellation policy, but I understand why they do it. For me I have a lot of last minute fixes that tend to force me to cancel late. So if you commit, you'd better be prepped to go! The workouts are hard but you feel fab after!  Spin classes are really great too, Peter does an awesome job. If you're just starting out in spin there are 30 minute classes available.
