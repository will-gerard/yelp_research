The feeling of luxury and exceptional service start upon entering the private elevator to the top of the talking sticks casino and continues till your departure. The food is four diamond rated and rightfully deserving. Highly recommend the small plate, which features scallops served on their original shells, to start with. Some other highlights feature the rib eye and sea bass which are beyond reasonably priced for their quality. Our server, Julio, was amazing and was there attentively throughout the night with helpful suggestions and whitty banter. He even went above and beyond when it came to dealing with a very particular/demanding customer such as my father. Oh and did I mention the view is FANTASTIC!

Love the food but it's ruined by how POORLY managed this place is!!!!!! They Quoted us 30-40min wait and 2 hours later we're still waiting. Sadly we won't back.

The original chopped salad and scallops with corn grits along with the above and beyond service is enough to have me coming back again and again!

This place sucks.  The bouncers are so rude. Please spend your time and money going somewhere else.

The chocolate covered bacon is a hands down crowd pleaser! The prosciutto omelette and granola french toast are amongst my favorites that keep me coming back to this place!
