Just plain old NY style pizza and hot wings are very good.  I don't care for anything else on the menu so stick to these two things.  The Italian dishes are not good at all!

Everything here is good.  The hot and sour soup and sesame chicken are my two favorites.  The delivery is always fast and food is hot.  Really nice staff as well.

Cardboard topped with sugary pizza sauce and butter slathered on the crust.  The entire thing just tastes fake.  Sorry not edible!

When the first location opened on Indian School the food was good.  Now that they have expanded to multiple locations and the owner is no longer the chef the food is not very good.  The biscuits and gravy were barely edible.  There must have dumped a cup of salt in there holy crap!  They have a lot of sugary menu items that aren't really my thing for breakfast.  I've heard the chocolate chip pancakes are good.

Wow compared to the animal shelter in Phoenix this one is a dump.  Poor dogs had lots of poop and pee in every cage.  Smells so bad it's difficult to even walk around.  How sad.  Shame on this place!!

I've had nothing but great food from this place but they just can't seem to get orders right.  Yesterday I ordered a chicken, pork and beef enchilada.  I received all chicken enchiladas and my server said they can't seem to get these orders correct.  I sent the order back and they boxed me up what was supposed to be my original order but when I got home I checked and of course it was all chicken again.  In the trash it goes.  #irritated

Their food is just too good to not give them 5 stars even if sometimes the staff is a little slow.  Good food is worth the wait!

Really good Thai delivery food.  It's always fresh tasting and fast delivery.  I've had many things on the menu and the only things I haven't liked are the curry dishes which I love at other Thai restaurants.  Every dish you are able to choose the spice level which is nice because I like it hot!  Thai tea is really good here too and helps with the spice.

The food is mediocre.  It's difficult to eat anything because of the stench that hits you as soon as you walk in the front door.  Smells like pee and dirty mop water.

Running through the airport to my flight and thought I would sit down for a quick bite to eat.  The breakfast menu was small with only 5 items but they all looked good so I thought I would give it a go.  My waitress sat me fast and obviously had too much coffee this morning but no big deal, she was nice. I opted for the Monday Quesadilla, apparently they decide what's inside every Monday.  Mine was filled with Oaxaca and Jack cheese, short rib and egg topped with chipotle sour cream drizzle and fresh Pico de gallo.  YUM!  I scarfed it up so fast my waitress thought I dropped the plate.  Airport food at Phoenix Sky Harbor has definitely been changing for the better and this was just another example of how a local restaurant can serve the same great food in an airport location.  Next time I'll try the Chocolate Chip Pancakes!

This place is amazing!  We had our items delivered by Postmates and the food was still piping hot.  If you try anything here it MUST be the Pig Wings.  It's like a giant 1/4lb "chicken" wing - mostly meat on one bone.  It came glazed in a chipotle sauce that was nicely charred on a grill with a cilantro ranch dipping sauce.  Lip smackin' good!!  Then we had White Cheddar Mac & Cheese, Adobo Braised Short Rib, Al Pastor Tacos and Key Lime Pie.  It was all amazing except then taco I would give it a 3.  Everything else was so tasty once I had the taco, it was just not up to par with everything else.  I'm excited to come back to try some other items on the menu, and have more Pig Wings of course!

First time finally trying this place out.  I've been here 4 times but it is always too busy to get a seat without waiting 1-2 hours.  This time we came at 730am on a Sunday which was the perfect time since dining room was half full and patio is empty.  The menu is eclectic and different from any other breakfast place.  They have a list of hollandaise concoctions, breakfast tacos that are to die for, many different pancake options and the typical breakfast fare such as omelettes, eggs etc.  the service was fast and super friendly.  We had 3 different servers talk to us and make sure we were taken care of.  We will definitely be coming back and if there is a wait, it is indeed worth waiting.  Until next time.

The pizza is really good and tastes much more authentic than most pizza places.  The wings come without sauce and the sauce is in the side which is a bit weird.  It seems difficult to get all of the sauces and the correct amount of sauces especially for a large wing order.  Online ordering would be really nice too.  I think if those were fixed it would be 5 star.

I've never heard of a pizza place that doesn't have real pepperoni.  The crust taste good but the sauce was very salty.  The French onion soup taste like it came from a can.  The Fettuccine Alfredo was so bland it was like they just added cream and no other flavors.  The chocolate shake was about the only thing that was good.  I'm really confused as to how this place gets so many good reviews.

Really awesome burger place.  Had the burger which was super juicy and the fresh brioche bun soaked up all the goodness.  The fries really made the meal though.  I don't know what they were tossed in but I could come back just for the fries!!

I really love their juices here but their customer service makes you not want to ever come back.  All 3 times I've been here the teenage girls act like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.  Usually takes 10+ minutes to get anything even if there is nobody else here.  They are just busy in the back gossiping.
