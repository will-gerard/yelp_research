Dr. Riechow works wonders! I have been a patient with Moon Valley Chiropractic intermittently since 2011 with lower back and neck pain. His adjustments make it possible to continue my active lifestyle while providing instant pain relief. Recently I've needed to return to the practice for adjustments during my pregnancy. I was experiencing pain and tightness in the lower back with challenges walking or sitting for long periods of times and sleeping. After a single adjustment I was able to sleep through the night, get back to my physically active lifestyle and even travel via flight for a lengthy time with no issues.  Dr. Riechow and his team are affordable, accommodating and always a joy to be around. Dr. Riechow took the time to thoroughly examine and understand my issues prior to and during any ongoing treatment. I highly recommend him and his team for massages and chiropractic adjustments!

Macie is our 8 month old Yorkie baby. I am extraordinarily picky about anyone that groomers her in any way, even her nails. I have been too scared to get her clipped for several reasons; unsure the groomer would give me the desired look and nervous about leaving her anywhere. I've never left her with a groomer where I did not stay the entire time and watch them.   Diane at Canine Preferred in Scottsdale, AZ changed all of that. I did my research about their location (and many others in the Scottsdale area) prior to my final selection - I was pleased with her reviews, experience level and appreciated she is a no kennel facility. When discussing the grooming process with her she was very confident and made me feel secure about her abilities and the safety of Macie being in her care.   When I returned to pick up Macie I was literally shocked! My baby looked amazing! :) I was SO pleased that she has the freedom to play with the other dogs and had the exact cut from the picture I showed Diane. We are officially repeat customers!

The food is a typical mainstream American smorgasbord. You might get lost in the menu but that's ok because whatever you order will be decent enough. Not stellar. But decent. The best part about this place is their ridiculous beer selection. I don't care who you are, you will learn something about craft brew here and you will certainly find options you've never tried. A tad over priced for what you get.

I love this place. The sushi is always fresh which initially surprised me being in the desert. Definitely recommended.

My wife and I went here early one evening and had a wonderful experience. The service was exceptional as was the food. I really enjoyed the calamari appetizer. It was unlike any I'd had before. We enjoyed ourselves, however, my steak was no better than one half the price I could have gotten down the street at The Keg Steakhouse. Perhaps I should have ordered fish. My wife loved the sea bass. Be prepared to spend some coin.

I love love this place. The menu is exceptionally unique for this part of the country and their prices can't be beat. Seriously. You can spend $10 - $15 on a fulfilling lunch and still need a to-go box. I've been here dozens of times and will be back dozens more. I always sit at the bar because the girls are friendly and especially attentive. As a bonus, they rotate talented artists work every now and then which is cool to look at while you relax.

I've been here a few times and always enjoy it. On our most recent visit we sat at the chefs table/bar. It was by coincidence but ended up being the best seat in the house. Chef offered us complimentary dessert and additional starter portion just to be kind. The food is amazing for a pizza joint. I definitely recommend it and ask to sit at the chefs table!

This place is fun and creative. I totally dig it. When I'm in the mood for some island food this is where I go. Awesome drinks and a lengthy menu will please anyone. The patio is great too. Only complaint is that sometimes the service leaves something to be desired. All in all I say try it, you will love the vibe.

Great ambiance and a decently unique menu. Their beer selection is pretty solid too . Nothing too out of the ordinary in that department though. The fish tacos are my fav.

The breakfast burrito with chorizo keeps me coming back again and again. For lunch try the Kahlua pork sandwich. If you're not into that they always have specials and many other tasty options. The service is great too (unless they're slammed). We typically avoid that by sitting at the bar if necessary. Otherwise they have a chill patio... Try it out!

The meatball starter is bomb. Pizzas are some of the best... I think it's the crust. They have gluten free too but in my opinion, if you don't have to go gluten free, don't waste the opportunity to have great pizza just to save a few cals. It's kinda like cardboard. Beer selection is really good and the bar staff are educated and can guide your palette. It's typically dead during the day but late night is a bit busier, especially with service industry folk.

This particular location is either run by 15 year olds or a bunch of stoners. Literally every time I order from here they forget an item (or 3) and sometimes bring the wrong thing all together (like the wrong flavor of soda or cookie).  I have called for refunds multiple times and I have also sent drivers back to the store for the rest of my order more than once.  Why do I keep ordering from here? I suppose I keep hoping they will get it together! Plus, sometimes, the food is actually "freaky fast".   Staff-- sloooow down and read the tickets. That is all.

I used this company to fix a leaky pool pump. They charged me $125 dollars to tighten some screws and replace two parts. The leak never completely stopped but it was much better - just a slow leak - so I didn't complain at the time. However, the leak gradually increased to its original intensity. This made me think that the service tech did not correctly fix the issue. I would expect the manufacturers parts to last longer than a few months. When I called the company to have them come back and actually fix the issue the lady, Sherry, was horribly rude. She was unwilling to send someone out to fix the issue without charging me again. She blamed the parts manufacturer and implied that perfect pools quality of work is not to blame. When I asked the typical longevity of parts she did admit that it is much longer than I experienced; but again, she refused to admit it could be Perfect Pools service at fault. She refused to fix the situation, said I was being unrealistic, and suggested I call a different company for help. I asked if Perfect Pools guarantees there work and again she blamed the parts manufacturer.   I will never use this company again and I highly recommend you avoid them as well. Not only do they not guarantee their service but they are also very insulting and rude. Beware!
