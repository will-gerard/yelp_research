I can not give my opinion on the fish cause I only get the shrimp cocktail and hush puppies. I just can't get passed it. I have to order them. If my view on the menu is limited then so be it. As far as the shrimp cocktail and hush puppies are concerned. I love this place.

Upon walking into the office I was a bit perplexed. I thought I was entering a free clinic. I'm still not sure. My appointment was for 1pm. I wasn't seen until 1:50pm. Had I been that late they would have cancelled my appointment. Nonetheless I saw Bryan Monson, at least I think it was Bryan Monson, perhaps it was (Silver Surfer: Can enter Hyperspace. tied Nova He can enter Hyperspace as well. tied Green Lantern)the whole appointment lasted 1 minute 35 seconds. He referred me to  Dr. Garcia in the office for surgery. Explained it for about 15 seconds to my daughter. I guess I'm too old to understand and was out like a shot. Yeah, errr won't be going back. No thanks for the Botox.

I have lived at T.J.Maxx since it first opened. Shopped there so much I even bought stock in the Company. Why not? But as far as customer service. This place is awful. I would love to do the hiring if only allowed. This is not just a service thing. This is a management thing. Ever since I can remember they have had the worst managers I have ever experienced. T.J. Maxx is in some serious need of a makeover in the mgnt training dept. Also when I have complained to corporate I have never in many years, ever received a response. I have since sold my stock and have cut my shopping here by more than 50%. And I mean, shopping. I was a junkie. I'm not sure I can ever cut it off completely because I can avoid the staff. But if I am any indication of how others are treated, their sales must be way off.

As it turns out. Yes, I can a avoid the staff. I still love the stuff here and between this and homegoods, I'm broke. Still am not too happy with the people they hire, but they have gotten better. Especially at home goods in Chandler.

First of all, why is it still saying closed? Im here! I gave it two stars for fun factor and for the simple fact kids don't really care if its the filthiest place Ive ever been in. The most horrible junk food and dilapidated. I do like the staff. Jeez, there a bunch of kids with after school jobs. What the hell do you want? I don't know what kind of LOVE they put in this place but i suggest it give the ring back cause that ain't love! Why are all skate rinks like this? If they can class up bowling? They can do the same for his distant cousin skating rinks.

As it turns out this place is not a restaurant with a bar, its a bar with a restaurant. Made the mistake of bringing my 8 year old. One look at the kiddie menu and i knew i should have left. Instead of just making miniature meals from there menu they did the old, don't bring your kids here again, they are not welcome routine. I know ours popular in this obese children's society to feed kids crap but who the hell feeds their kids macaroni and cheese for dinner? Isn't that a side dish? When did this become a main course from hell? How lazy can a parent be than to serve a kid macaroni and cheese. Oh yeah, order macaroni and cheese. So as it goes we order from the main menu. Chicken with mozzarella sandwich and i had the salmon. It was way too much to pay for frozen meals. The rice was swimming in soy sauce and pineapple. I'm a carb addict and if i can't eat it, its not worth eating. The green beams i have to say were the highlight of the meal. They tasted like the ones at outback which i just love. The salmon, just more frozen fair. Parmesan fries uneatable, sandwich, just not worth it. The ciabatta roll was dry and tasteless. I think since thus place failed so miserably at a restaurant they note solely cater to the bar. Its a shame they can't handle both.

Love the clothes,hate the staff! I'm sorry but something goes wrong every single time I come here. Today, brought 5 items to the counter, came home with 4. And that was from the kiddy mgr who had to take over because the rest had never seen a check before. After his 10 minutes of flubbing and absolutely ignoring anything I asked him he finally rang it up. Grrrr I hate having to go back.

Dear God I should have ran to the hills when I walked in and saw 5 out of 5 people working there with electric shears in their hands. I refuse to call them stylists. I mean all I wanted was a trim for my 7 year old. Just a straight line. I'd hate to see her take a sobriety test.

Look, I know there are things are the menu that are better than others. And at first about 10 years ago when they opened I wasn't that crazy about them. But now, their menu has really improved. The cucumber salad is incredible. The side veggies are fantastic. It always tastes the same. No surprises. That's good.

My mother has been seeing Euyoung for years and I have seen her on occasion myself when I was in a tight spot. Unfortunately I let my snobbish ego get in my way. I've been spending $300 plus for color and cut for years. I've gone to top shops suggested by Elle magazine,Vidal Sassoon, Dolce, absolutely everywhere! Granted I can't get color here but after having Euyoung cut my hair last week I really don't think I will ever have anyone else cut it. She is a pro and I was ecstatic walking out.

Ive been coming here for years. I have tried every single place in the valley. Although some are good, there are just too many dishes that are great here. Love the spicy noodle, went on that binge for a while. I have tried the Panang everywhere else and it doesnt compare to siames cat. I dont really care about the decor or the location. If you want decor go to scottsdale. It's not a good location for business though, right off the freeway, so it's mostly know by locals.

I am amazed that anyone liked the food here. I had the spaghetti and meatballs. I mean really, what can you do to spaghetti. Well, I guess you can use old sauce. This stuff was uneatable. The garlic bread was white (that means raw dough). The sauce horrible. Perhaps the sandwiches are better, but i doubt it.

Chicken is great! No so much on the Mac $ cheese but I've never been too much a fan either. Service can be sketchy at times and a little TOO casual. Especially when a game is on. Why is it every single restaurant caters to the football/basketball crowd? It's annoying.

I was hoping to give this a better revue. I tried but I just can't. I had the risotto which was not bad but way too much and I would rather asparagus or some other vegetable than that tasteless and teeny shrimp. My daughter had the margarita pizza which again is NOT a margarita pizza. That was not fresh mozzarella. I don't like (boxing) my food up even if I have extra. But this was definitely left at the table. I kind of had the idea when I started to walk into the restaurant. The outside patio is surrounded by big potted dead as a doornail pots outside. Now, I know no one is probably using the patio in the dead of summer but it is the face of the restaurant and it should be kept up. When I walked in I understood why. The whole place looks dated and not that clean. I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this place.

Update: Childrens department just gave this place it's 2 more stars. They should fire the lot in cosmetics and use the sales people from the childrens department. They were a pleasure to deal with.  I used to shop here a lot. Especially my perfume. They had a very wide selection which they have reduced quite a bit. Yesterday I spent over $450 in 5 minutes. I should have known better than to show up in my jeans and t-shirt but I was in a hurry. As it goes the service was fair when I got it. Absolutely every single sales person was too busy gossiping to notice I was there. When they did all they did was point. I mean, c'mon. No gift wrapping for gifts. I bought perfume at nordstroms and they used a simple but nice wrap. Neiman is off my list. Not only that, they only accept american express. How Bourgeoisie and well...OLD.

I know I was here years ago and it was not bad. But, OH MY GOD!!! Whoever is running this business has to deliberately running it into the ground. They must be in hot water with the IRS or something. There has to be some reason, some meaning to this restaurant still being open. Granted all the others are closed, but why in Gods name is this one still open. Look, I can eat. I'm not a little girl. I can eat Totino's frozen pizza for Christ's sake. I could not  down this if they paid me. Run, don't walk. I never like buffet's but this is horrible. The closest I ever came to liking a buffet was lubbys and I don't care if old people went. It was pretty good but those days are gone. Run away...Run away...

I got the panang which was good but still not better than Siamese cat and the meat was a bit scarce. I also sampled the sample platter which I had to give away. Maybe the problem was I got take away but I could not eat any of it. When I picked up the food though the ambiance was nice and looked clean. It was pretty busy also so maybe it's a better dine in experience.

I came here because I had gotten my eyebrow pierced in 1992 at the shop in phx by the original owner. So much for being unique and different, just kind of retro. They were so professional then I automatically thought of them when one of the holes in my ear closed after 30 years. When he told me he could just push something through and save me about 25 bux I thought. Well I guess I could that on my own but hey he's a pro and probably less chance of infection. But when the bill came for $78 I almost lost my teeth. Holy shinola, remind me to buy a pair if gloves and dip a straight pin in alcohol.

I'm sorry I can not give an accurate review of the food. The filth after just stepping a few inches inside the door was so overwhelming I had to leave immediately. I have been here many years before and never remember it being this bad. But this was bad! The menus were sticky and dirty. Everything was old and filthy. I can usually eat at most any dive but this was assaulting!  Pink pepper! You are in serious need of an overhaul.

I had to give this place a no go for one reason alone. Their return policy. I have been seeing this more and more from shops owned by china. I understand the clothes are only made to last a few months at best so this policy makes sense for that. I must admit some of it looks really cute but the grievances that i have read are spot on. Bad quality, falls apart, never anything above an XS. Too bad this kind of product is so accepted by so many.

Used to come here years ago when it was run by the previous owners. Never ate mexican food here. Only came here for the ribs. When the new owners came in they bought the recipe and it was done really well. The ribs are the best I have ever had. I have not been here in the last year so I don't know if they have kept up the quality. Can't speak for the mexican. I think there ribs are the hidden gem here.

So, I too am a pizza freak. Grew up in NYC and Florence Italy. I have had pizza all over the world. I'm just not seeing Gramaldi's as having good pizza. First time I was looking foward to it, having had heard so much about it. I was very disapointed. So, I brought some of my family. Again, not impressed and neither were they. As much as I would like. Just can't give it the thumbs up.

Brought my 4 year old daughter here. They scratched her 100 times s she cried. I had too tell them to stop. My fault that i didn't know what to expect and let out go too long. There fault that they are supposed to center their practice around children and have no compassion our common sense when dealing with children. I think perhaps they should stop taking new patients if they are so busy they can't take the time to care for there patience.

Pho was phooey...the meat inedible. What is happening to Vegas? They claim this is the only Vietnamese restaurant on the strip. Well, then get off the strip or more Vietnamese people need to move to Vegas. This is a sad testament to Vietnamese cuisine. Other than the woman at the front desk the service was excellent.

I keep going here and keep trying but I just can't justify going back. With their high prices and awful customer service, it is not an enjoyable experience. I only wish frys would carry bison because that is the only reason I go,but its just not worth dealing with a staff that refuses to go out of their way to simply do their job. I have a problem when the average American can't afford to eat healthy because the prices are so out of reach to do so.

I've waited a long time to give a review. I just don't want to go on a few visits, but I think it's high time. Years in fact. It just gets worse and worse. Did someone say SLIGHTLY higher prices. I said I wouldn't come back again. I came for the orange juice machine and left with the fish mans attitude that the fact I asked him to take the head off the trout makes me common folk. I can't tell if the nasty attitude of the cashiers is from ego or having to eat their nasty prepared foods. I'm trying very hard to put my finger on what it is. Are they throwing every spice imaginable in to make tofu taste good or just trying to be creative on an empanada? Either way everything I've tasted prepared here taste like crap.  I almost cracked a tooth on one of the coconut macaroon. All the cookies were stale. I threw them out. The bananas lasted 2 days. They were not organic. The prepared Jicama was slimy after 3 days.  I spent over $250. Probably threw out $30. My main purpose after the great orange machine was the bison. At my usual grocery store I usually buy a roast or whatever is on sale and have the butcher grind it. I asked to do that for a bison roast, they refused saying their mgr would not allow them to do that but the ground bison is freshly ground. ( I guess freshly ground is relative). This time they told me it's brought in already ground. Ground where? When? What parts are in there? No answer. Just enough parts to make it 98% fat free. Well. An asshole is pretty much fat free too. Is that in there? I am just getting my own grinder. I just want the truth. Is that too much to ask? I will say, the time before this the fish man deboned and filet my fish. Beautiful. That's what made me come back. I probably will go back after a few months but not for $250. Just the juice, just the juice. Don't go in hungry!

Ok so I have always bragged how I loved Siamese cat all over yelp. Since they were closed today and I saw so many people on yelp claiming this placed was better, I decided to try it. I can only compare the one meal but so far I am perplexed what people are tasting. I got the satay. It's chicken satay compared to Siamese cat Mu Satay (Pork). The cucumber dressing at Elephant did not have one cucumber in it. It had some carrots and onions but not one piece of cucumber. The peanut sauce was not bad but not half as good as Siamese. I got the beef Panang which I was sorely disappointed in. It was way too sweet. I actually gave it away. At Siamese it has a very earthy flavor more than a sweet flavor. The Kafir lime leaf is very pronounced at Siamese which I love. Now, the people who ordered with me loved their meals so perhaps if they all go someday I'll try a noodle dish and compare that but for now. I'm staying loyal to Siamese Cat.

Look,i don't know what the people who gave this place more than one star are smoking, but I could have used it today. Had to drop someone off. Lets give it a try i say to myself. Hmmm looks closed, lights off in the back. Wait a few minutes. Mysterious head pops up, comes out, takes my order. Must buy combo to get slice. Fine. Hmmm where do i sit. Lets try outside since every single table is dirty. Ok after 5 min a slice of cheese pizza is set before me. One taste and i couldn't tell if he gave me pizza or the box it came in. Look I love pizza. I'll even eat totinos, but two bites and i was gone. This place had to be a front for something. Maybe they have a hidden casino in the back. Maybe i didn't give the code word. Smuggling ring perhaps, cause it can't be a pizza place, that's for sure. Please close and make room for something eatable.

After telling Lisa I had been to 3 gaps looking for a sweater and coming here to get it, I asked her if she had an additional sweatshirt in a medium. In which she replied after helping a phone customer. Yes we have a medium. Ok i say. I didn't see one there. Well its probably sold. Hmmm wha? After using my gap sense from being a frequent shopper I looked for the proverbial mannequin wearing a medium. There it is i say to another sales associate. Can I get that one? Sure. Thanks. Lisa needs more gap sense. And better customer service skills.

Ok so I have no frigg'n clue who Don Shula is or was! Not even sure if he is dead or alive. Ain't gonna google it either. ( ok maybe now I will) Fillet was great. Mashed potato's Yum! Asparagus! I cus, you cus, we all cus for asparagus. Great! Great service. Look, I don't go out of my way for a steakhouse. I can do a fillet at home for the fraction of the cost. To go to a steak restaurant is almost a waste. I want to eat out somewhere that I can't create at home. That being said. On the east side of town, if you at the casino, if you want MEAT ( insert manly grunt) this place is fabulous. I was well fed and not stuffed and weighed down. Clean and comfortable.

DO NOT, I MEAN DO NOT EMPLOY THESE PEOPLE. If I could give it a negative star that would be what I would give it. I can't just blame American home shield  These people were brought out by American Home shield to my mothers house who is 75 years old and was told she needed a part. After two weeks and no word I called American home shield for her and they told me the part was only ordered that day. 2 weeks? hmm. O.k. So now a week later I called the company who was assigned to the job and asked if the part was in. I told them that her washing machine has now been out for over 3 weeks. He didn't know anything about the part. When I asked what now? He said "Call somebody that cares" Luckily I had a representative from American home shield on the line to hear how rude he was.

I used to love this place. Finally found a place that gives great designs for pedicures. Problem is there is never anyone qualified around to do them. Today was the final break. After 4 attempts at a gel manicure I'm done. Problem is, most of these businesses aren't too concerned about their regulars leaving since they do such bulk. What ever happened to caring for the customer base?

As much as I hate to write this I just have to. I always loved coming here because of the vast inventory. I weathered the evil employees and management because there were just too many goodies.I mean, Millie is a bitch. OK so Millie is dead but Millie jr and so on are meanies. What is up with people who buy Hallmark stores. They all suck. Well, NO MORE!!! After spending thousands of dollars on Swarovski in the past 2 years, not to mention hundreds in dept. 56, I'm done. So, never mind that I waited at the Swarovski counter as everyone ignored me, I just figured it was the sweatshirt. I mean, I really didn't look the part of the buyer. I looked more the part of the shoplifter, but, oh well. Never judge a book by its cover. After asking for help I waited...waited...waited. Ok, so you can't find one of the pieces I'm looking for. NP. Not to mention after spending that kind of money I get the big $2 and $3 coupon from the big spenders Hallmark, I have to get attitude from the road torn and worn redhead at the counter? I explained how Swarovski is giving %15 off over $150. If you can't match it I will just order from them. response "OK" uhhhh  Can you match it "NO". Not sorry, not oooh wish I could, no tsk, the big FU NO. Goodbye mini Millie's.

If there were a negative star for this hospital that's what I would give it. I had my daughter here after hearing what a great hospital it is to have a child. Let's forget that my Doctor never showed up and that his partner who had 2 years experience finally did the C-section after 15 hours of labor. Forget that she was in distress before they did anything, forget that I was in a labor room the whole time, forget that my blood pressure dropped so low that my brother had to alert them that I was passing out. Those things can happen. But I can't forget that when I was feeding my daughter the nurse told me she is either eating a lot or you are bringing the food home. Nice comment, excuse me "accusation". I will never forget that when my bandage that they use to support the cut from the c-section was being replaced by myself in the bathroom, the nurse, or whoever she was repremanded me when I went to throw it away. She told me "oh no, we wash them and re-use them". I was mortified!. I told her, "not on me we don't" Ok, so I will forget all of that. This is the thing I will never forget. "I got Mercer infection before I left the hospital and it was dismissed" When I called infectious deseases, they didn't even want to hear it, they never called me back. My wonderful Dr. told me I would have to take 2 rounds of a heavy duty anti-biotic and get my bandages changed every day and I would have to go into a clinic to have it done. Thank God I have good insurance and didn't have to do that. He never checked up on me. The hospital never followed up. This hospital is a DANGER!!!

This will be my last contract with Verizon. I just bought the droid razr. I did not get any kind of a deal for signing to a new contract after being eligible for an upgrade. Not only that but when I went to Costco the phone was cheaper. When I went into the Verizon store in Chandler to inform them of this they said "Oh yeah, we know that" then snickered. Oh wow, nice reaction!!! "We ripped you off and think it's funny" Not only that but at the same time I bought the Xoom as a gift. Don't tell me you don't throw in a few extra's every now and then. That may be a policy but to say it's not done is an outright lie. Greedy cheats. I am livid at this treatment. I think perhaps it is time to bite the bullet and pay to get out of my contract or check to see if I have a grace period to get out. It's only been 5 days.

OK someone commented to me that they make their own meatballs so yes they can run out. I say, even less of an excuse to run out, you can make more.

Since someone had already mentioned the lobster tail I thought I would give it a go. I came for the steak but will come back for the lobster. I could have used a bigger one probably because it was so good. Yes, as a matter of fact it was the best I've ever had. The other people in our party had the steak. Sirloin and filet. They both said it was fantastic. Love the shrimp cocktail, even though $4 a shrimp is quite pricey. Asparagus great! Service was great. I had no problem in that area.

This will always be a favorite. Daiquiri ice, strawberry cheesecake. They are always coming up with new and fantastic flavors.This place makes stone cold look pathetic. I don't know why I'm comparing since i hate stone cold. The service has always been great. The atmosphere is true old Tempe. Its a staple in this area.

Well, this is why I can't trust Yelp anymore and don't use it. 4-5 stars for this place is ludicrous. Best pizza in the valley? Ugh! I'm being generous with 2. The meatballs are awful, the bread too soft, the pizza is average at best. It seems as though all the ingredients have been sitting out for ages. Nothing seems fresh. My coworkers order every Sunday so they must love it. When I'm too busy to go out I sometimes order (rarely) disappointed again.

Grrr Wish I would have read the review of Jade on this page before I went. I missed my usual appointment at my regular salon and was leaving town so I made a last minute appt at mood swings. Big mistake. First of all after explaining to Jade for at least a half hour of what I wanted in color and cut the blank stare should have made me run. Hey, I'm leaving town. I need color. I think Jade didn't know what to do with someone over 40. After all, I must have wanted a bouffant or something. How much can you explain a pixie cut. There are only so many ways to explain that to someone. I wound up styling my own hair even after getting a hairstyle book and showing her what I wanted. I specifically asked for someone who is good with short hair. The receptionist told me "Oh that's why I put you with Jade, she is good with short hair" Really? She sheared my head with thinning shears so much I'm looking bald. I specifically showed her another stylists hair for color. Errr not the color I got. I can only surmise that the people on this site that gave them 5 starts have never really been to a good salon. Next time I miss an appointment with my salon I'll go to super cuts.

I applaud the professional response to my rather emotional review.

Wth has happened here. First let me start with what I do like. Honey hot sauce. Still my favorite. The chocolate chip cookie dessert. My daughter liked it. I ordered a dozen honey hot. The fat on the wings made them inedible. I feel like I'm biting through gristle. It's a shame because I like the salt and pepper too. But someone needs to do some serious quality control here. Service! Excellent. Danielle is the second star.

So this is the 3rd time I had been here. It was convenient and I'm not a connoisseur of cupcakes so I don't know all the place to go for them. The first time the cupcakes were so moist. Better than I had at other places. Despite the rather abrupt and curt people who worked there I said I would be back. Next time it was ok. Not as good as the first time. A little dry on the chocolate cupcakes I had tried. If my daughter doesn't want it, that's just wrong. Again, not rude but curt and hurried. Brought the girl scout troupe here this time. Since I bought a half dozen to take home and asked that just 2 of the others be put in a separate container the girl behind the counter said she would have to charge me .50 for the box. REALLY? Again I felt they had better things to do then wait on me. I also was the only person in the store. After not so great cupcakes again, bad service and the additional charges I'll find another cupcake place.

Every time I go they are out of the stevia flavors. Not a fan. Very bland,but the toppings are great. The staff though freaked out when one of my kids touched a holloween spider on the fake cobweb. It wasn't enough to tell them not to touch it. She had to repeat it after they walked away. she REALLY, REALLY loves her holloween decorations. Take a chill pill kid. If you don't want things touched, put it away. Already bitter and doesn't look a day over 19.

So we all ordered from work. Not the first time. They forgot the dressing for someones salad. I called them to let them know. I told them I didn't want any freebies just the dressing. Guess what the manager did? Yep, he delivered it. Now that's customer service. They get 5 stars.

Frankly I thought they were awful, and I'm a bread eater. I could barely eat half. Now, I haven't completely given it the thumbs down because I only tried the bagel and the other stuff on the menu looks kind of good. I will update if and IF I ever come back. Now, as for the numerous people mentioning New Jersey. These are supposed to be NY bagels. Why is anyone mentioning Jersey. Once and for all! Jersey is not and never will be NYC. And I don't know where the rest of you are from in NY. Long Island perhaps? Buffalo maybe? Those are NOT NY bagels. Again, as in the pizza. Maybe its the water.

Had a great time here. Ambience is great. Staff even better. A little pricey on the Tuscan blend, $12 a glass, even though a whole bottle is like 20 bux. But I'll do it again. We sooo need more places like this in downtown chandler.

First time here, only went through drive through. I only had the hot dog but I was thoroughly impressed. Perhaps the best hot dog I have had in quite a while.

Dear god truer words have never been spoken. This was the worst. I starved all day for this? I admit, perhaps a little snooty being Italian from NYC, but hey,I understand this is not NYC. But this was way off. The food was horrible. The place was filthy. I couldn't get in the shower fast enough. The people at the gate were just rude. I'll never go back. Yes,the woman with the cookies was wonderful. Worth checking her out.Cannoli's were great. But this was far from an Italian festival. I also plopped 150 bucks in 2 hours. This was a carney con!

I was so busy with everything that I didn't even realize I was calling and ordering in Avondale. I live in Chandler. Bout a half hour away. No biggie but they better be good. I sent them a pick from Pinterest of what I wanted. Every single person at the party boasted about those cupcakes. Finally when I got to taste one I was thrilled. Moist, fresh,perfect amount of frosting! I will def take the ride again!

So it's only my first time here. Had the soup and Thai pork rice. I have been looking for good Vietnamese for a long time and this was the best I've ever had. I will definitely go again . Customer service ehhh. But who cares. Not crazy about the brisket so will try something else next time. Maybe meatballs in the soup. Good ambiance.

I have got to say one of the best burgers I have ever eaten out. I had the Truffle Parmesan Fries and Chanterelle burger with figgy onion jam. Dear God he needs to sell that figgy onion jam. I just love saying it. Figgy onion jam. I hesitated with it but glad I delved in. The fries are enough for a whole table and absolutely delicious. The service was slow but friendly and courteous and didn't ignore us.

I have only done drive through. Never had a problem. I grew up never liking pastry,cake,ice cream,pie,chocolate. Yes, perhaps a freak. When Krispy Kreme came to town and I tried one,my taste buds sang for joy. Well, maybe it was a fat arse curse. But they still sang. Alas, I thought,I now liked doughnuts. When they pulled out of town. Someone at work brought in Bosa's then again dunkin donuts. What? DOUGHNUTS SUCK! I don't know what people like about fried cake but even the smell makes me Ill. Soooo Krispy Kreme back, me likey! These are not doughnuts. These are eatable crack fluffs! Yum!

I so wanted to love this place. Used to live at a place called SNO in downtown Tempe too many years ago. Fresh everything. This place is not fresh anything. Love the smoothness of the ice. I gave a second star because of the great consistency. But I got half lemon, half watermelon. The lemon taste like floor cleaner. The watermelon was another chemical concoction. My daughter got cherry, which was edible but that's about all I could say about it.

I will never go to another Chinese place EVER! This place blew me away. I never order orange chicken for the simple fact it's always greasy or the breaking is mushy. But my daughter does. I tasted hers and couldn't stop tasting it. It was fresh and fantastic. I had the yellow curry and it was delicious. It earned it was hot but mine was nice. Still good flavoring. Will be taking everyone here. Only suggestion is that I just can't find one place that serves those little won ton chips at the beginning. I guess I have to make my own! The atmosphere is great. Have not checked out the entertainment yet. Looks like fun. Great place for the east valley!
