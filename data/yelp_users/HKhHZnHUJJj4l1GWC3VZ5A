This is the worst chipotle location. Bad service. Horrible staff. They are never attentive, and I always have to repeat myself multiple times. I live close so I've been countless times at all times of the day. Unfortunately, each visit, the bad tends to outweigh the good. Had to pay double portion of meat just to get the amount I get at any other location. I will drive further for a better chipotle experience.

I come here at least a few times a month. If you enjoy Pho, you don't want to miss this place. If you've never had Pho, you don't want to miss this place. Eat here.

Everything about the beer, building design, and food makes this my kind of place. A fantastic brewery in Phoenix.

This review is mainly for the coffee. The coffee is some of the best in North Phoenix. I always buy a pound when I'm out grabbing my weekend coffee. Always fresh roasted, always good quality. I usually stick to an Americano or black coffee, but I would definitely recommend trying the Bob Marley if you like those sweet fancy drinks. It's a chai tea latte with banana and coconut (make it dirty with a shot of espresso).
