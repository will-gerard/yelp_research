Aaron and his crew provide the best service around.  I had them seal my home right after I bought it.  No bugs ever inside!  Most other pest control companies come out quarterly to spray.  Titan comes out monthly.  Here's the kicker; it's the same price or less than the quarterly guys.  I never see bugs or weeds in my yard.  The office staff is very nice and efficient and the technicians are well trained.  I have 3 dogs and they are exceptionally careful to close and lock gates so the animals don't get out.  I highly recommend them.  Shop local!

Dr. Wiekhorst and associates have done exceptionally well for me and my precious animals.  He came in on Thanksgiving day to get me an emergency prescription.  When I'm there he makes me feel like I'm a personal friend of his and I know he really cares about my animals.  I know he'll do the same for you.

Just a quick note to tell you how much I appreciated you and your team.  They did a great job, were happy, professional, and made every effort to perform an excellent service.  In this day and age it's hard to come by, I'm glad I found you.  Thanks again! Andy Tobias

I love Bryan's BBQ. The food is fabulous. If there is anything I'd change its the atmosphere. I'd like it to be a little more quiet. The floors at concrete and the surroundings a little stark. Could be more upscale. Food is the best and the people are better. It's a great place and I go there often.

Used to be really good. They've had a big turn over in personnel and now you have to go all over the car and check. It takes twice as long. Today it was over an hour

Love the Barby at the Tennessee Grill.  They are located in the commerce park in Anthem very close to my business.  Whenever I have a lunch meeting I take them to the TG because the food is great, service fast, and the surrounding are quiet even tho there are lots of people there.  Bob has a great restaurant there.

Well, Danny's is gone but Jackson's I not any better. Came in today for the works. 1 guy is operating the vacuums, he is buying his ass. 2 other guys are standing around doing nothing. The wash tunnel is empty and there are 5 cars waiting for vacuuming. Hope it's worth the wait. I tipped the only worker here $5.
