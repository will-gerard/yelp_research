Great acoustics here.  Went to see Motley Crue and were definitely pleased with the show.  Would definitely go back to a show here again.

The food was ok but for a place called Coney Island I expected quick service and it was so slow. our group had to get our food to go and then eat it cold because we were late for our appointment due to super slow service.   I would probably not return

This was an amazing experience for all ages.  So many butterflies to look at and take pictures.  If you move slowly they will land and go for a ride.

My husband and I decided to check this out for an early dinner on a Saturday evening and really enjoyed going into Toby Keith's.  I have seen a lot of negative reviews but have to say we did not have an issue with service.  Our waitress was very attentive and I never once had to ask for a refill on a drink.  The food was decent and the atmosphere was decent.  would like to go in for an evening when there is live music and see how that is.
