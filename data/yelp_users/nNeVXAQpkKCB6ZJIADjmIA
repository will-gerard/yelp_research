I enjoyed Ka a few years ago and chose to rewatch it instead of seeing a different Cirque show because I felt my husband (who has never been to a Cirque show) would enjoy it's thematics.    Still a fun show with some surreal moments and bits of comedy mixed into the action.  However I am perplexed by their decision to replace the final battle with a poor projection.  I understand the reason being the fatal accident last year but other parts of the show use the same wiring and harnesses and the main issue really is the poor quality of the projection.  It's out of focus and seemingly low quality, it really detracts from the overall enjoyment of the show.  Honestly it ruins it.  Instead of a big epic finale, you get a long boring bad quality projection that you can't tell what is happening so you just wait for it to end.  I hope the producers of the show read these reviews and find a way to rework the show with a different scene instead of using that awful video.  It completely cheapened the expensive experience and I cannot recommend the show until they make changes.  I would have appreciated a note citing the change to the production before we purchased tickets.

Quite delicious and a decent price for Vegas.  We went for the Champagne Brunch and our ambition was to arrive early enough to pay the breakfast price and rollover into lunch/brunch, heh. but our intentions to wake up early in Vegas after a night out drinking was a poorly planned one. We arrived at 10ish, but the line was loooooong.  I believe we waited about an hour and got to the cashier just after brunch started so we paid the full $25 pp.   I think it's one of the prettiest dining areas for a buffet I've ever been to.  It's set to look like a lovely French village with painted skies, gardens and shops.  It really is quite quaint. and comfortable.   There was a nice variety of food.  The grilled veggie and meat station wasn't very good (meat was very dry), but the pastas, risotto, carved meats, and salads were reportedly delicious.  I wouldn't know.  I gorged myself on crab legs (they were salty and sweet and tender. yum!) and breads (yummy pretzel rolls and hard rolls).   They had a nice variety of desserts, the usual cakes and pies and icecream machine (but nice dipped cones with sprinkles and such) and mini creme brulees.  I was bad and took two creme brulees with the intention of only scraping off the very topmost crisp burnt sugar layer. :D

Great service.  pretty contemporary casual setting. Solid food.  I couldn't decide between salad or pizza and settled on ordering both and requesting a box right away to take the left overs.  The waiter informed me that I could get a half salad, which I did and it was the perfect amount.  I had the chopped vegetable salad with olive bread and creamy greek dressing.  I expected the bread to be soft, but it was fried croutons.  Pretty tasty, but more tangy/vinegary than I expected out of a "creamy" dressing.   The pizza was huge.  I had the mushroom, leek, and goat cheese.   Shared with friend and still took half home.  Friend had the cuban sandwich, her plate looked a little sad with just the grilled sandwich and a handful of chips and vast empty plate area crying out for a pickle or green garnish of some sort.  It was pretty tasty, but not really what I expect from a cuban.  The roasted pork had a citrusy marinade and was juicy, but I don't think it went well with the cheese and pickle (sweet).     overall great value.  cuban sandwich, mushroom pizza, salad, and two non-alcoholic drinks, tax + 20% tip = $47

God I love this place.  My Vegas days of debauchery and regretful mornings are far behind me so this was actually the most anticipated stop of my trip. Is that sad?    Of course this place isn't really suitable or enjoyable to those that don't LOVE MEAT. but for those who do, it's heaven.  I came here on my last visit to Vegas but was woefully unprepared and only sampled 4 of their meats. I think they offer 15 types!  This time my goal was to sample every single one.  We discussed eating strategy extensively prior to arrival.  I made sure to skip breakfast and lunch and to wear my eatin clothes (stretchy waistline, so important!).  We also did a little smack-talking and basically made it a eating competition.  I know, so classy right?  Despite my gross approach to this place I would like to let those who have never been here know it's a beautiful restaurant, perfectly appropriate for a romantic date (but don't bring shy dainty eaters here) and prices run pretty parallel to a moderate steak house.   I love their salad bar selection of cheeses, grilled and marinated veggies, sushi, soups, and other sides, but I was ridiculed by my dining mates for even putting the greens and starches on my plate as they would take up precious space in my belly and I would lose our meat eating challenge to those that wisely skipped the salad selections. "whatever, you don't know me!"  I thought smugly to myself.  And then the glorious meat parade began.  Garlic Picanha (top sirloin), Picanha (sirloin), fraldinha (flank steak), and lombo de porco con quiejo (parmesean crusted pork loin) all came out immediately.  There was very little talking for the next 10 minutes, just moans of pleasure.  Next came Filet Mignon, and then it was trumped by Bacon wrapped filet, costela de porco (pork ribs), parmesean chicken, linguica, and Cordeiro (leg of lamb).  I didn't even take a portion of each and I was already dangerously overstuffed.  My dining partners saw how I had slowed down already and were mocking me and my failed "eat every meat" goal.  I am not a quitter though.  Mid game I decided to cut a deal with a fellow competitor and diner and offered to split portions so we could taste more meats without exploding.  there were cries of "That's CHEATING!!!" across the table, but everyone knew it was a smart move and quietly adopted it themselves as not all the meats had come to our table and we were in pain.  Costela de Boi (beef ribs) was one of the table favorites, even after all the meat saturation and many requested seconds.  Costela de Carneiro (lamb chops) made an appearance, their dainty form teasing us. " just one more bite.  look how tiny and delicate we are"  This is how Mr. Creosote must have felt.  I think I was the only one to indulge in a lovely little chop. It was not "wafer thin" and I did not explode thankfully.  Others opted to have repeat servings of the parmesean pork,  the picanha, beef ribs, and the bacon wrapped chicken or filet.  The only thing that the table unanimously didn't like was the parmesan chicken.  It was dark meat with bones and some didn't like the taste or didn't like the bones impeding their meat eating.  I personally ate everything except the beef ribs, pork ribs, linguica, bacon wrapped chicken, and bacon wrapped filet.  And ate partial portions of everything else except the lambs, the parmesean pork, and picanha.  So I wasn't the table winner, but I didn't care I was happy.    oh yeah, forgot to mention the garlic mashed potatoes, tapioca cheese breads, and cinnamon bananas (to cleanse the palate between meats) were delicious too.    and our waiter Max looked like a young Nate Fillion for any Firefly fans. haha.

Last time we were in PHX we spent $75 for a terrible meal at Zinc so we were looking to spend a bit less and I checked out reviews and this place seemed popular and well rated (and cheap as far as airport grub goes).  They were pretty busy but hustling along so we placed our order.  The burger looked great, but tasted not so good.  As I always try to point out the positives, I will say the buns were really good, like a brioche or egg enriched bread.  The main issue was my burger tasted and smelled like dishwater.  It was subtle, but definitely a distinct off taste.  I deconstructed the burger to figure out why it tasted like dishsoap, and I think I narrowed it down the the lettuce and tomato?  the tomato was also pale and unripe.  Maybe somehow the veggies were not rinsed well?  They had a stale industrial sink sanitizer taste. I tasted the meat patty seperately too and it was not good, also had a bit of an off taste, kind of the taste of meat that's been cooked and refridgerated and reheated, even though I know the patty was cooked to order and not reheated.  My kids were not interested in finishing their burgers, and my husband shrugged and said "it's airport food".  The fries are standard frozen fast food fries.    I don't think I'll be eating here the next time I'm traveling through PHX.

Went based on favorable reviews in comparison for other dining options.  Don't be fooled, this isn't high end airport dining.  The quality o f the food is very poor and insulting when you factor in the prices.  I've Trader joe's $4 salads that were better than the $16 salad I ordered.  The salad was soggy and watery, you know how no amount of dressing or toppings can save a salad that was improperly rinsed and dried?  a simple cocktail will run you $16-18.   Service was good, no complaints there.
