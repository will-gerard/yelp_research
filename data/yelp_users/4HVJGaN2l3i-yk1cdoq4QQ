The surliness and thievery committed by the Phoenix based TSA employees really ruin PHX Sky Harbor from being a traveler Friendly Airport. This is also the same airport that kills drunk housewives! I use this airport weekly and have had numerous gear stolen by TSA employees at checkpoint C... Stolen items include portable hard drives, laptop batteries, USB drives and an LCD Projector.

When it comes to bagels, the various types of cream cheese based spreads to put on them, and some good coffee to wash it all down with, it does not get much better than Einstein bagels.  This location gets pretty busy on weekend mornings, but weekdays are a breeze.  It is less than a mile from my house, so definitely one of my fave places to go for carbs.

The people at this location, a former "Mail Boxes, Etc." business are very friendly and go out of their way to provide exceptional service.  Recently, my wife ordered two new commodes for our house from a plumbing supplier and had them shipped by truck to our home location. Somehow, the shipper used our credit card billing address for the ship to address in error. Our mail gets delivered at this UPS Store location... The staff at The UPS Store accepting this shipment of two very large crates from a common carrier trucking company, called us up and then when we got there loaded the crates into the pickup truck we borrowed.  And these crates were VERY HEAVY! Kudos to the UPS Store for being exceptionally focused on their customers! We have used ths location for 6 years..

Experience the Rat Pack era with an evening at thi old school Las Vegas Steakhouse.  The steaks are good, the drinks are strong and the service is old school fantastic, as if they know exactly what you are thinking. I have ha the bone-in ribeye and the filet mignon... My preference is the filet.

I've rented 3 different storage units at this StorageOne facility and have been disappointed in multiple ways, There have been numerous instances of unauthorized charges to my Amex Card which I used to set up automated monthly rent payments. There was an incident when I was loading furniture from my storage unit into the back of my Chevy Pickup truck when an office employee pulled up in her car and asked me to move the truck because it was in her way. There was enough room for her to drive a vehicle twice as big around the front of my truck. She stated that as an employee of StorageOne she should not need to drive around a customer's vehicle. I kept on working and she drove around my truck quite easily and parked at the other end of the lot. The next day I received a phone call from the StorageOne GM who wanted to know why I had been harassing his employees... He was a total jerk about it. Then, I gave StorageOne a months advance notice I was vacating and emptied my unit on the last paid day of storage. They charged my Amex Card for the owing months rent. When I requested they credit my account their response was my last paid rent day was on a Sunday so they checked the unit on Friday and saw a few items remained inside, so they charged me for the following month. $225 and when I pushed the matter further they told me if I didn't drop the matter they would charge my credit card again!!! These people are dirty rotten scoundrels! Don't go near this place.

I tried to do business with this business when I needed four tires for my 2006 Chevy HHR and their bad attitude and surly disposition drove me over to Pep Boys where I gladly spent over $600 on tires that would have cost over $800 at Discount Tire... Stay away from this place, there are far better alternatives.

This Discount Tire store in Las Vegas deserves the "Tire Store of the Year" award for customer service! My ex-wife #1 recently started using my 2013 Chevy Camaro during her extended stay here in Las Vegas. I warned her that the right front tire had been slowly leaking air for the past few months... I had to put air in it every 3 days and was certain that a nail was the culprit.  So I asked her to take the Camaro to a tire store and get the nail removed, the hole plugged to fix the slow leak. She took it to service adviser #713 William J Tuller Jr. at Discount Tire on N. Rancho in Las Vegas. Despite the fact that she had no appointment, and the tires were not from DT, Will treated Maggie like a VIP... Not only did his tech find the nail which was causing the slow air leak in the tire, he removed it and plugged the leak, then he also replaced the valve stem, high speed spin rebalanced the wheel/tire, put air in all 4 tires... THEY DID ALL REPAIRS AT NO CHARGE!!! Maggie was pleasantly surprised when she went to pay the repair invoice and Will handed her the keys and said "There's no charge, all the work is complementary... Thank you for choosing Discount Tire..."  When Maggie came back and told me how much the repairs cost, I asked her a flurry of questions. How can Discount Tire repair punctured tired at no charge? Surely they'll go BK doing stuff like that... Then I thought about it some more and realized that there is a method to their madness. Because any time I need wheels, tires or related items and services, I will go to Discount Tire! THAT IS HOW YOU CREATE CUSTOMERS FOR LIFE!

When I was admitted to the UMC Trauma Center for a life threatening injury, my treatment included orthopedic surgery. The surgeon assigned was from this Bone & Joint Specialists medical practice, so my follow up visits have been to this facility. I am very comfortable with the surgeon who is treating me, but their office staff seems to be incompetent in several areas. Recently, the office staff was supposed to call me with a location and appointment time and date for an MRI... They have not called me, as promised and my calls to this facility are met with terminal hold times.

If you fly on Southwest Airlines a lot, and then take a flight on US Airways, the differences are dramatic... Besides all the details around US Airways passenger abusive baggage handling policies, flight change services and the horrible discomforts of their aircraft seating design, there is the nasty and confrontational attitude of their employees! Sometimes America's worst airline is a necessary evil, but avoid this carrier whenever possible!

Bandera is one of my favorite places to bring visiting out-of-town guests because the service is consistently "best in class". The Bandera Baby Back Short rack of ribs is the best I've had from anywhere in AZ. On this evening, my guest Sheldon had sliced sirloin and enchiladas which were excellent, both in presentation and flavor.  There are lots of restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale, and many of them are very, very good... But, I keep going back to Bandera because of their incredibly consistent high quality service and a menu that may be less variety than most people are used to seeing, but which every single entree is excellent.  Plus, I seem to run into a lot of the PHX Valley's movers and shakers in this establishment while dining there or hanging out at the excellent bar that seems to be quite the hot spot.

I returned from a biz trip to PHX and my 2002 Ford Expedition would not start due to a bad battery, so after getting a jump, I brought it it Five Star Ford. They are close to my office in the SkySong Center.  They replaced the battery and tested the system. I received a call at 3:00 PM letting me know the vehicle was ready. When I got there, the service cashier was delightfully friendly. When my Expedition was bought up to the cashier's area, I was pleasantly surprised to see they had washed and vacuumed my expedition. The experience the Five Star Ford team delivered, along with flawless repair services completed an hour before they had been scheduled to finish make this dealer a "Five Star" in my book!

I was shopping online for a used full size SUV and found a decent mileage 2002 Ford Expedition at Sanderson Ford's website. Having been burned before, I called and asked to speak with a manager to verify the dealership still had the Ford Expedition in stock. Operator transferred me to the Internet Director, Dave Tedder, and he walked out onto the lot, and described the truck to me as he was touching it! Then he snapped a couple photos and emailed them to me, in real time, while we were speaking.  I drove about 45 minutes to get there, but it was well worth it... Dave was great, the 2002 Ford Expedition is a 4x4, which is rare in AZ and the whole deal went down easier than any other vehicle purchase I have ever made... And that would be well over 100 cars and trucks during past 35 years!   I highly recommend Sanderson Ford and also recommend their way-cool community online at www.SandersonCommunity.com to pick their brains about car related stuff.

As a frequent traveler I am harshly critical of airport facilities and how they are managed. Although there are many features of the McCarran Las Vegas Airport (LAS) that I like, the parking fees are exorbitant, baggage handling is atrocious and takes far too long to arrive on the carousel, and like many airports, the payout and design are optimized for maximum inconvenience to travelers. Of course, McCarran is one of the few airports with gambling and slot machines, and the Oxygen Bar is more than just a novelty. The people moving trams are fast and efficient, with frequent pick ups on two tracks. Lots of great shopping, some interesting displays and several places to eat that are better than what is at most airports. Beware of the taxi stand on certain busy days! I have seen waits of over 45 minutes while moving through an impossibly long line to get a cab after waiting more than 30 minutes for luggage to start rolling on the carousel.  There are times when getting out of this airport will test anyone's patience, due to heavy passenger volume.  All in all, this is a unique and special airport, and don't forget to check out the pink 1957 Ford Thunderbird that was originally used as a giant fire extinguisher for the airport's outside gate areas... It is truly a one of a kind!

Southwest is the best of all the domestic airlines. They are far from perfect but having the highest paid flight attendants and pilots of any domestic carrier goes a long ways to their team's positive attitude and willingness to go the extra lengths necessary to take all the drama out if air travel.

Excellent food, beverages and service in a decidedly French Restaurant atmosphere. We had a wonderful time with a party of 4, the service was superb. the food was tasty and excellent quality. I ordered what the menu described as a Ribeye Steak, but it looked and tasted like a particularly tender and flavorful Filet Mignon.  The souffle and sorbets for desert were superb.  I recommend this restaurant and would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the server misrepresented the size of the deserts, insisting they were small single serve portions not suitable for sharing, when in fact the desserts were very large servings very much suitable for sharing... The sorbets were three full scoops! This made us feel like we had been "sold" on ordering extra desserts, which was quite "tacky" for such an otherwise superior example of a French Restaurant.

Worst Residence Inn I have ever stayed at. Gave 2 stars instead of 1 because front desk staff was apologetic. Property is a train wreck. The rooms were not very clean, bedding was old and worn out.  Front desk staff were inconsistent in their willingness to send taxi's back to the building my room was located in.  All in all, the most disappointing Marriott property I have ever stayed in.

I have flown on Southwest Airlines virtually every week since 2002. For 5 years I was flying SWA out of ABQ and for the past 8 years I have been flying SWA out of PHX.  The best thing about SWA is their people... They actually seem to care about their customers, especially in comparison to any other airline I have flown... And, I have flown on every domestic carrier! There have been several instances where this genuine concern became very apparent to this high mileage road warrior. I fly enough to have both A-List and the Free Companion Card. Once when an emergency came up, my wife had to return from PVD the day before I could return, after much consternation, a manager was brought to the ticket counter at the T. F. Green Airport in PVD and he went ahead and issued a ticket to my wife at No Charge, despite the fact that I was not going to take the same flight until the next day... Hooray for that manager in PVD! He did the right thing despite violating company policy.    For people like me who travel on business as part of their regular weekly job duties, the fact that SWA does not penalize their fliers for changing tickets at the last minute is the most truly distinguishing official policy difference with other airlines.  There have been many times I have arrived to the airport several hours earlier than planned due to finishing work in less time than originally estimated.  If there are seats available on an earlier flight home, no problem, SWA will put you on the earlier flight without a $150 change fee like other airlines.  This is great, and it works when you are late as well!    Despite being a former US Airways Chairman Preferred snob who swore he would never fly on the "Southwest Bus", SWA has become my carrier of preference to the point where I will fly into an airport further away from my local destination, so I can fly on Southwest instead of any of the other "We Hate Our Passengers" airlines!  Southwest luvs their passengers and their people's attitudes show it.

I have been flying somewhere for business or pleasure just about every week for 15 years... Most airlines operate on the basis of despising their passengers. Southwest is unique in that their employees are happy to work there, and seem to genuinely like their passengers.  After being a "Platinum" and "Chairman Preferred" frequent flyer on other airlines, with First Class upgrades and overcrowded VIP lounges, I am now doing 90% of my travel on Southwest because they simply do a better job of consistently getting me to my destination, on time, while treating me like a true friend along the way.  I tell many other travelers that I choose Southwest Airlines because they take all the drama out of air travel!

It is usually difficult to get very happy with any bank. By their very nature banks tend to suck... But, not so with Wells Fargo and especially this mini-branch inside a Safeway Supermarket. I have had my personal accounts there since 2007, but what really made me appreciate this branch was when I started doing business banking there. First, I opened a business checking account for the advertising payments I started receiving from Google for a couple of my blogs. Then, when we grew the business and incorporated as Automotive Media Partners, LLC I went to this branch to meet with them. The business banking manager walked me through various options for setting up our new company accounts, handled everything very professionally and provided a level of service that exceeds what I have come to expect from banks. He set up accounts for AR, AP and Equity. The Wells Fargo banker set up my Merchant Services account so we could take credit card payments... At a discount rate of 2% and 2.25% for Amex (very low cost). Then he went on to approve a line of credit for the company that far exceeded what I expected.  AMP has exceeded our revenue forecasts for 2012 and I am appreciative enough for Wells Fargo and the way this branch treats me an my company to be fiercely loyal. My investors have tried to get me to move accounts to B of A and I have insisted that we keep our growing business accounts with Wells Fargo and this branch.

Dr. DeBaker sent me here for an assessment, but they seemed more concerned about hitting me up for money to pay for a root canal BEFORE they even did the assessment to determine whether or not I should get a root canal in the first place. This is obviously a place of business where their first priority is maximizing the money they extract from each patient and NOT what is in the patient's best interest!  Once I got in the dentist's chair, the Dr. came in and convinced me that I needed another root canal. Wham, bam and 30 minutes later I was out of the chair and paying the bill... I only went here for an assessment! Anyways, I think the Doctor who worked on me did a great job, was very skilled and highly efficient, plus he got a second opinion from one of the other doctors... But, make no mistake, this practice is a money generating enterprise with little concern for their patient's best interests.  The receptionist reminds me of a mafia bill collector!

Truly home cooking style Mexican food served by a friendly staff with the owners doing the cooking.  The Chile Rellenos are excellent, and my wife says the Enchiladas are the first she's had in a restaurant that come close to her grand mother's New Mexico style Enchis... Very reasonably priced and there is usually several sports events on the TV's facing the dining area. They do a great job of preparing each meal fresh, but doing so very quickly. I highly recommend Rio Rico because it is great food at low cost and we should support independent restaurants like this. This is not a national chain.

My wife and I have eaten here more than a dozen times and it is one of our faves.  The service is superb and the food is freshly prepared in the kitchen to come out like what you would experience with a home cooked meal at a Mexican Grandmother's.  This place gets our highest ratings for value, quality and service.

Dr. E and I ate at Rio Rico's last night after returning from downtown Phoenix events and I wanted to update my review... First of all, this restaurant is remarkably and refreshingly free of corporate operating style people... Entering Rio Rico you are greeted by people who may not have been trained in the chain restaurants schools of management, but who are genuinely happy to see you walk into their establishment. Seating is approached like match making, based in what is right for YOU, rather than a seating distribution chart. Appetizer recommendations such as the guacamole are based on what is fresh and in-season rather than the most profitable sale. I ordered the #11 combo plate with a Chile Relleno and a Tamale, along with an Arnold Palmer to drink. Everything wad served promptly, in the right portion sizes and was muy delicioso! I highly recommend Rio Rico because it is simply the real deal... You've got to try it!

This is one of the best food markets I have ever been into, but if Wegmans is a 5 star, then AJ's is a 4 star! I really like the AJ Fine Foods Deli with lots of great foods, ready to eat and ready to go, along with some of the best service you will get in any Food Store.  The wine section is amongst the best you will ever see and surpasses both selection and quality of many wine specialty stores. A wide variety of ethnic specialty items makes every trip to AJ's like an exploration of foreign cuisine possibilities and the pricing is not too high to discourage experimentation.  Overall, I highly recommend AJ's from all perspectives; Food quality, selection, pricing and service.  yes, AJ's is slightly more expensive than Safeway, but makes up for this disparity with quality and service.

AJ's is unique amongst Food stores and not for the price sensitive customer. I enjoy buying beverages and floral products at AJ's and appreciate their wide selection of wines, organic juices and energy drinks. Their floral department is well stocked and will allow you to select a pre built bouquet along with several additional flower stems to have them rearrange into something unique and then priced as a new bouquet.  My favorite way to bring flowers home...

We have eaten at least a dozen times at Ra's and despite the trendy decor and atmosphere, really enjoy their sushi and sushi roll combinations. My preference is eating at the bar, but dining room service is fine. The spicy tuna roll and hamachi yellowtail tuna sushi are my favorites. Service is prompt and friendly and the bartenders do an exceptional job of mixing from an extensive custom drinks menu. Several special "martini" drinks are a joy to sip and the music sets a fun, upscale and sexy tone for this restaurant-bar combo.

This place uses its position as the sole 24 hour nail salon to overcharge by 100% to 300% and to justify the poor quality of workmanship and the bad attitude of their technicians. I'm giving them two stars because they are open all night, but I definitely recommend you avoid this shop unless you're drunk at 3:00 AM and absolutely have to get your nails done.

Massage Envy is the best way to get into a regular monthly schedule of therapeutic massage in a soothing spa like environment for a reasonable cost. The fact that you can use your prepaid massages at any of their hundreds of locations all over the USA is what makes this program so good for frequent travelers like me. I have never had a bad massage at a Massage Envy despite using over ten of their locations and more than double that many massage therapists. I also recommend bringing a special friend and treating him or her to a massage on you... It is a great conversation topic afterwards and an excellent prep step to going out on the town.

This us one of the best Pizza places in the Phoenix Valley... Their sauce is not overly sweet and has a nice spicy overtone that makes the whole pie work as a culinary delight. Price wise, Casanova is a far better deal than the Coal Fired Pizza at San Tan Village.

AZ Derby Dames is a league made up of multiple teams competing in sanctioned Roller Derby "Bouts" on a banked track via a series of "Jams" it is all very entertaining and they do a nice job of combining sponsors with multiple announcers, raffles, give aways and color commentary... I attended their competition among 4 teams on April 16 at the Phoenix Veterans Coliseum and thoroughly enjoyed the evening.

The Fire-Roasted Soup and Half Sandwich is a perfectly sized meal that satisfies without over-filled bloated feeling... Elizabeth and I have eaten here at least a dozen times and it is one of our favorite places in Gilbert.  The sandwiches are well made with very fresh ingredients and despite the cafeteria line-up, the service is quite friendly and very accommodating.  I like the turkey bacon club, and their selection of multiple iced tea types and flavors is always a joy to partake of.  Although I generally prefer dining indoors, the outside patio is fairly comfortable and south facing so you will need the umbrellas for shade most of the time.  It is difficult to go wrong with any Paradise Bakery location, but this one is exceptionally nice and I highly recommend it.

I have stayed at dozens of Las Vegas hotels since 1981 and Aria is the best I have ever been to. The hotel rooms are first class and equipped with extensive amenities. The casino is well designed and avoids the confusion created by other properties. The Aria Convention Center facilities are best in class and located within stunning architectural design. This is the home of AutoCon 2012, an auto industry conference.

All the Apple stores I have been to deliver great service and are a pleasure to browse and shop at, but this one is my Fave because of the staff. The people working at this location have repeatedly delivered levels of service beyond my fairly high levels of expectation. There have been several times over the past few years when they have overruled Apple policy in order to take care if me, because of my patronage and loyalty. I appreciate this, and it is good business because their actions keep me coming back.

Storm, Dr. E and I visited Gilbert Dogs on Saturday and were very impressed with their unique approach to dog boarding and doggie day care.  We were thrilled with their level of staffing, 6 people taking care of about 30 dogs on a Saturday.  The lack of any strong odors tells me they do proper sanitation.  We booked a 5 day stay starting next Wednesday for our Lab/Pit mix, Storm. They were very nice and brought Storm inside when we visited, then asked us to wait in the car so they could see how our dog interacted with the others in their kennel.  Luckily, Storm passed their compatibility test, so we will follow up after his five day stay and let you know how it turns out... As of right now, I am so impressed with how unique and wonderful this place is that i felt compelled to share it with my Yelp friends!

I've brought several of my cars and trucks here. Sometimes they do great work, other times the work performed is so-so. Best value is the "Mini-Detail" which you can get for $89.95 if you tell them you saw their coupon in New Times. Today they did an excellent job on my Ford Expedition "Urban Assault Vehicle", which I am pleasantly surprised did not result in an up-charge due to size!

For me, Precision Cut is convenient, fast and inexpensive with a very courteous staff. I like the fact that they keep note in how I like my hair cut in their CRM system. The owner and her daughter are charming, beautiful and gregarious, plus they go out of their way to make customers feel welcome and appreciated. The only reason I did not give them a 5 star review is that they do not wash your hair before cutting it.  I personally prefer a wash before getting my hair cut.

Courthouses are generally not so great to be using, but kudos to the staff of the Clark County Courthouse in Las Vegas for using technology to streamline and drive efficiency in the various functions they process each day. Everybody I've dealt with in this courthouse has provided clear instructions, directions and answered my questions with thorough and complete answers. Getting through the security checkpoint here should be an example for airports to emulate. The officers won't let anyone slow the process down, which keeps everything moving along at a decent clip. When you have something that merits a case being dismissed, the ADA's here will quickly recognize the situation and within 15 minutes your case is dismissed. And... They give you the proper documents showing the case was dismissed... Just in case!

This Post Office is a disaster! The degree of major malfunctions cascade into an F Troop like situation comedy that's only funny if you don't get your mail through this facility or its local carriers.   Long lines await when your USPO mail delivery carrier flakes out and leaves you a nasty note in your condo mail box to pick up your own DAMNED mail at the U.S.P.O. Cuz he has had it with all the mail you get!  The wait time to pick up the mail that their carrier should have delivered is well over 45 minutes on any Saturday morning or afternoon... The Postal Workers here are rude, inconsiderate and slovenly in appearance and work ethics... The more people waiting in line... The slower they move. It is unbelievably unnecessary torture just to pick up a package or your mail at this post office!  Plus, despite being forced to wait in line for as long as 90 minutes, the USPO does not allow customers to use their bathroom facilities, or be permitted to sit or stand against a wall for support. You must be as uncomfortable as they can possibly make it while waiting insane amounts of time. No beverages or food are permitted during your marathon wait sessions either.

One of the best sandwich shops I have ever visited... And I have visited a lot! This place makes most Subway Restaurants look very amateurish and disappointing.

Once you try this place, you will go back.

I get very frustrated with restaurants that have misguided management practices... With PF Changs, they will make you wait 15 to 20 minutes minimum even if the restaurant is empty.  The management of this mediocre restaurant chain seems to believe by making every guest wait, it ads an air of exclusivity or some sort of scarcity mentality of desirability to their marketing efforts.  They pulled this nonsense on my wife and I today and we walked out, went next door to BJ's and were promptly seated, despite their restaurant being far more busy than P. F. Chang's.  Back when P.F. Changs was briefly the trendy and cool place to go, I enjoyed the food and service, but now that the bloom has worn of the rose and they still try this nonsense of making customers wait, despite available seating, they are just annoying and very trailer-park in atmosphere.  Avoid this restaurant, it is a charade of a business that it once was and does not merit putting up with their silly seating practices.

Towbin Fiat surprised me with their service and attention to detail... Although I was there as a "Third Baseman" to coach and advise a friend who had never purchased a vehicle previously, the salesperson quickly realized that she was deferring to me for opinions and decisions. He was very attentive to her, but would repeatedly hand me documents and reference materials for my review before my lady friend would look at them. This allowed me to carefully screen the information and documents so that I could hand them to her and advise "this is standard DMV stuff, go ahead and sign..." Or "You don't need this, it is an extended warranty and is simply unnecessary on a new Fiat" and so on. Despite the smallish size of this facility at Sahara and Jones, I was impressed with the additional inventory Towbin Fiat had in their storage lots and behind their showroom building. New Fiats are pretty much sold at MSRP and I advised my friend that the "deal" would really be about her trade in and financing terms. Towbin Fiat did an excellent job of TRYING to get her 2010 Toyota trade in at a low cost, but then acquiesced when we pushed for a higher allowance. The brain damage on getting more trade allowance was minimal and they didn't push us so hard as to alienate our desire to do business with them.  I was pleasantly surprised at the financing terms offered through Chrysler Financial Services because of the low APR on the 72 month fixed rate term without any prepayment charges and the additional APR reduction based on setting up monthly automated payments. Locking in a 1.9% APR for 6 years is going to look great when rates go up within the next 18 months.  Overall, I rate this dealer at 5 stars for those who already want to buy or service a Fiat... Now, do not ask me to rate the actual vehicle, because the Fiat 500 would NOT get 5 stars from me!

Although I was there as a "Third Baseman" to coach and advise a friend who had never purchased a vehicle previously, the salesperson quickly realized that she was deferring to me for opinions and decisions. He was very attentive to her, but would repeatedly hand me documents and reference materials for my review before my lady friend would look at them. This allowed me to carefully screen the information and documents so that I could hand them to her and advise "this is standard DMV stuff, go ahead and sign..." Or "You don't need this, it is an extended warranty and is simply unnecessary on a new Fiat" and so on. Despite the smallish size of this facility at Sahara and Jones, I was impressed with the additional inventory Towbin Fiat had in their storage lots and behind their showroom building. New Fiats are pretty much sold at MSRP and I advised my friend that the "deal" would really be about her trade in and financing terms. Towbin Fiat did an excellent job of TRYING to get her 2010 Toyota trade in at a low cost, but then acquiesced when we pushed for a higher allowance. The brain damage on getting more for her trade-in was minimal and they didn't push us so hard as to alienate our desire to do business with them.  I was pleasantly surprised at the financing terms offered through Chrysler Financial Services because of the low APR on the 72 month fixed rate term without any prepayment charges and the additional APR reduction based on setting up monthly automated payments. Locking in a 1.9% APR for 6 years is going to look great when rates go up within the next 18 months. Overall, I rate this dealer at 5 stars for those who already want to buy or service a Fiat... Now, do not ask me to rate the actual vehicle, because the Fiat 500 would NOT get 5 stars from me!

Entrata Di Paradiso as a name for this apartment complex is a humorously ironic stretch of imagination, at best... At worst, false advertising! "Entrata Di Inferno" would be much more accurate.  The management team here seems to be "tenant selective" and highly inconsistent in their responsiveness to resident made maintenance and repair requests. I moved into my apartment here in July 2013 and as of April 2014 several repair orders that were approved at time of move-in have not been competed, despite multiple follow up inquiries. A fairly major entry door frame and lock repair order approved in January has not yet been competed almost 4 months later... (I posted a photo) Yet several other repairs were made almost immediately after I requested them!   The Carpeting in my apartment was stained and dramatically over-worn out at time of move-in and looks disgusting and filthy despite multiple steam cleans. The AC is highly inefficient, consumes massive amounts of electricity and cools at marginal levels. Both BR Toilets are the lowest quality, crudely made, prone to leaks and loudest flushing fixtures I have ever seen, very third world! The first time I used the broiler in the oven, the insulation around the perimeter of the oven door caught on fire... I used baking soda to extinguish the fire and when maintenance repaired the oven they refused to clean out the oven or clean up any of the smoke damage caused by the fire.   Worst of all, the property managers of this apartment complex seem far more concerned with gossip, community drama, harassment by written warning notices taped to front doors, and passing judgement on various tenants throughout the compound, than they are on providing service to tenants or the upkeep, care and maintenance of the real estate assets that secure the development company's investment in land and facilities... The only reason I am rating this apartment complex two stars is because I have seen far worse at other properties... I just can't remember where?!?! Maybe it was Newark or Camden, NJ.

I have done banking with dozens of institutions over the past 40+ years, and with the exception of M&T Bank in Buffalo, no bank has ever treated me better, provided the right mix of services and done more to help my business than Wells Fargo. Moving to Las Vegas from Gilbert, AZ I was concerned that this local branch would not be able to match the service I received from the Gilbert Wells Fargo branch... I have been pleasantly surprised at the high level of personal service and the ease they make doing business at this Las Vegas Wells Fargo branch.  I highly recommend Wells Fargo, especially for small businesses and sole proprietors. I wanted to give this business five stars, but the reality is they are, after all, bankers!

I have used Super Cleaners for over 5 years and they have consistently done a great job and always delivered on my special requests. Clothes are ready on time, cleaned and pressed properly and they can fix any repairs needed as well.

As much as I personally enjoy this facility and the staff working their, I cannot justify 5 stars because of the cleanliness factor and lighting in their rooms. However, I have had some great times at this facility and have enjoyed their concert venues, conference facilities, casino, pools and shops. You can get some great deals by checking the HRH's calendar showing rates by each date online... There are times when room rates are available for under $50 a night due to lack of activity at their venues on those dates. If you are attending a concert, look for the packages that include a room or suite with your tickets. It is far more enjoyable to attend a concert when you are staying at the hotel where the concert is happening.The Pink Taco Restaurant at HRH is one of those funky places with great food and service, and I always make a point of eating their when I stay at HRH. To avoid the crowds and delays at the main entrance valet parking, use the rear entryway and valet parking which is much faster and better service.

When the Love Store first opened it was like a breath of fresh air in Las Vegas for consumers of sexual and sensual purposes clothing, accessories, toys and equipment... Since their grand opening, I have spent well over $5k on various accessories, shoes, toys, merchandise and clothing items for myself, my girlfriend and as gifts for family members. Over the past 6 months the store has replaced many of the original employees who were so instrumental in the Love Store's initial success and in creating the high class atmosphere that previously existed within the store... And made the shopping experience for customers seemingly worth the price premiums charged.    The new managers and employees are obviously less skilled, and told me directly that they received little to no training. At times they apologized for not knowing their merchandise, but would then when something was amiss, stare at us stone faced and unwilling or incapable of providing customer service and concern resolution. Case in point: yesterday I visited the store with my girlfriend and another couple. As we picked out various items we asked that they keep our purchases together at the management and checkout station. We spent over $800 and despite having had plenty of time to prepare for our checkout, they left security tags on clothing and merchandise... The kind that are impossible to get off, yet the store alarm never went off.    They also charged us for a pair of shoes at $89.95, but "forgot" to put them in any of the dozen bags they filled with out stuff... I went back in for the shoes, and the store manager acted very irritated, as if WE had done something wrong! We did not see the security tags (that they failed to remove) until after we got home... That is when we discovered that the manager who ran up our sales ticket did NOT put batteries in the many OVO toys from Germany (high quality) that we had purchased. Previously, on every occasion I purchased battery powered devices at The Love Store, they had always put basic batteries in the devices and then demonstrated that the items purchased worked properly before we paid for them... Always leaving that initial starter set of batteries in the expensive toys being purchased.   This time, the new Love Store manager deceived us... Deception? Yes, because she showed us the devices worked and had batteries in them as she placed hem back into the original packaging. But, she must have removed the batteries when we weren't looking, probably while we continued to browse and shop for more overpriced stuff...   Prices? We also noticed that prices on many of the consumable basics, such as massage oils and lubes had been dramatically raised... to levels that many would describe as "Highway Robbery".  For example, a small bottle of Astroglide brand silicone lube was priced at $28.95 in the love store... I bought the exact same product today at Walmart for $8.59 --- now, I don't expect a local store with premium service levels to be price competitive with Walmart, but a 250%+ surcharge for The Love Store is simply not justifiable! There are many stores in Las Vegas with similar or same products, and now that the Love Store has hired incompetent clerks and managers, their price premiums across the range of all their merchandise can no longer be tolerated... And certainly their over priced merchandise and deteriorating sub standard service should NOT be validated by Yelpers doing business there.   SUMMARY: AVOID THE LOVE STORE... THEY ARE GROSSLY OVERPRICED AND STAFFED WITH UNQUALIFIED AND INEPT MANAGERS THAT WILL CHEAT YOU OUT OF PRODUCT YOU PAID FOR, AND WILL NO LONGER PROVIDE THE PERKS OF THEIR PREVIOUSLY PREMIUM SERVICE LEVEL FORMAT.   However... Should you choose to ignore my dire warnings and partial descriptions of my shared negative experiences, be sure to pick up a set of Bolt Cutters at Walmart to get the security tags off the clothes you paid more than twice their retail value to buy at The Love Store.

After I posted my original review the President of the Love Store contacted me... He was sincere, gracious and focused on making things right. We went back to The Love Store and their staff on duty had been prepped by the President before our arrival... They more than made things right, they went above and beyond what most people would consider reasonable. My Girlfriend and I were delighted with the additional merchandise we purchased. Plus, the adjustments the Love Store made to correct our original purchase, combined with the genuinely warm and helpful service we received, made us want to keep coming back... This is why I am changing my original review from a one star to a five star. AND, the staff at the Love Store never asked us to do anything in regards to any online reviews.

I recently needed to buy an economical car as a third vehicle in our household for my mother-in-law to drive.  After doing research online, we decided to shop for a Mazda3 5 door.  At first we went to another Mazda dealer in Mesa who also sells Fords, but did not like the way we were treated.  When we went to CardinaleWay Mazda, we were treated with respect and one of the managers, Greg Limbeck helped us figure out how to register and insure the vehicle so that it was OK for me to buy it, and my M-I-L to drive it.  Here's the real kicker, we bought the car on Saturday and the following Tuesday Greg called and asked us if we would get upset if the financing was lowered from 8% to 6% APR... We went back to the dealership and it was no trick, the APR was reduced and we were able to shorten the contract terms with very little increase in payment.  Plus they were able to finance and register the car with my M-I-L on all the docs so that the insurance is easier than last time.  All in all, CardinaleWay Mazda treated us better than when we bought our last vehicle, a new Cadillac at another dealership and it has been the best car buying experience we have had in a long, long time.
