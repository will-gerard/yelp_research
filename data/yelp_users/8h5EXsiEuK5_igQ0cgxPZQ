We had just played a show down the road at PHiX for the 1st annual Grand Avenue Festival.  This is a festival organized by the businesses on Grand Avenue.  The paisley Violin is one of those businesses.  That said, we came in and struggled to find a seat for the six of us.  Several 2 or 3 people groups at 6 people tables.  So we all squeeze onto one round table meant for 4 at the most.  Strike one - wait staff should shepherd small groups to small tables.  Our waitress finds us after a 5 minute wait and takes our beer order.  Many of us order the same beer.  One person orders a very common mixed drink comprised of Cola and Whiskey. The waitress has no clue what it is - replying with "What's that?".   Funny, but a bit of a clue about how our epic 2.5 hour dinner will go.    A larger table freed up, so we took it.  I guess wait staff hate cleaning tables that have people on them, cause she left a big pile of crumbs laying for us to snack on.  The next round of drinks, they were out of our new favorite beer because they must have a small fridge, so some of us walk outside to look at the beer list, since the waitress doesn't know them.  Those who walked outside got their drinks ordered.  10-15min later, a new waitress asks us if she can get us something.  Yes!  The music was nice, and the musicians were very courteous and concerned with the volume - our band could take notes on that.  I ordered the gyro.  I've had about 20 different Gyro's in my life.  This was more like a salad burying a couple very thin slices of meat.  I'm not a meat maniac, but they sure did skimp for some reason.  This new concept of saladwich was good, but not really what I ordered.  Also got the seafood chipotle soup which was interesting and tasty.  They must have been out of beer, because they didn't come by for any more drink orders.    Hopefully the owners of this place will learn to stock up on wait staff and beer for special events.    Another review said that the waitress had been on for 12 hours.  She was somewhat incompetent, but I fault the owner/manager for lack of preparedness.

Worst ribs I've ever paid money for. All caked up with god knows what and half fat.  They were all you can eat, so I should have been wary I suppose.   Nice view, but nothing spectacular.  Free cotton candy dessert, which was fun.

In Las Cruces, NM this place is a bit mediocre, due to some of the amazing competition there.    When placed in Phoenix, it blows away much of the competition.  But I miss southern NM food, so I am biased.    Get the rellenos - green chiles stuffed with cheese and then battered and deep fried.    Love the salsas and free sopapillas.

My favorite sushi place in town.  We always get the spicy tuna and the crunchy california.    I've never had a bad roll at this place.  The wait staff has never left us waiting for attention - they are all sweethearts.  Everything is priced nicely and they have specials up on the board.    Hiro, the owner, is from Japan and is typically working on the bar - they seem to be having a good time back there, rolling up a storm.  I'd recommend reservations for groups of 4 or more.  The place is small and often frequented by Japanese, which has to be a good sign.    Big beers, wine and saki are there to wash it all down.  The green iced tea is recommended as well.

I'd been to another chuy's in Phoenix - it wasn't bad.  This place was.  Is it open?  Barely?  Bland beans, lukewarm chicken fajitas, and our waitress dropped the food and ran.  The only good things were the grilled pepper and onion on the fajita - the chicken must have been cooked a few days back and kept warmish.  My cutie had the mahi tacos and the bland watery beans.  She said the mahi was ok, but I say they were very fishy tasting.  You know - old fish.  Went in on a gamble since I'd been to one before and this is close to home - but as another reviewer said - NO DICE!

Badass burgers. THE BEST ONION RINGS. Nice patio (I think they even made a smoking section). A million TV's if that's your thing.  They have beers besides all american most people think they like.

Papago is a strip mall microbrewer with pretty good food and great beer.  They have a nice selection of import and domestic micro brews in the fridge.  Around 20 taps stand by, dispensing fine crafted beverages.    If you enjoy orange sweet tarts, try the Orange Blossom beer - their consistent crowd pleaser.  Can't say that I like the stuff.  Their Robusto porter is one of the best porters I've ever had.  This place can get really loud.  The service can be sporadic.  You won't see anyone for 30 minutes and them bam - 4 servers come by right in a row.  Really guys?  There we go, those are the negatives.  This place kicks ass.  Best beer selection on tap and in the cooler.  Mix and match 6 packs to go.  Good pizza.  Italian sandwich is quite valuable.    The selection on tap rotates regularly, you'll be sure to find something you like if you're a beer lover.  Be sure to try a sample or two before you commit to a full size serving!

Fry's is a consistent disappointment.  The employees can be helpful and courteous.  Two major problems.  Once fixed, I would LOVE this place due to their massive selection.  1.  Special signs are placed misleadingly next to similar products with minor differences, while the actual sale product is sitting on a pallet somewhere else in the store.  They hope you won't notice and you'll walk out paying much more.    2.  Their on-line inventory look up has been wrong every time I have used it.  I drive myself over there to find an empty shelf.  I also suspect this is done on purpose, just to get you in the store.

The place was dark and hard to find - the sign must be out, or maybe they don't need it.  There wasn't a seat left in the tiny hallway of a restraunt, so we made our way all the way to the back and sat ourselves down at a massive table.    Service was good.  Food is a nice change from standard US fare.  These are deluxe hot pockets which may look small, but pack a pretty filling meal.  Hoegarden on tap too, way to go.

The chicken and veggie place is great for a healthy lunch.  Plenty of broc and cabbage.  The spicy teriyaki sauce is good as well.  Wish it was a little cheaper for lunchtime - but there aren't many fast places where you can get veggies.  The plate and drink will cost you $8.

We just bought a house with an evaporative cooler on it in Mesa.  The previous owners said that the building of Tempe town lake cut 3 months off of the time they could use the coolers due to the humidity being raised.    Also the dam has popped so there is no 'lake' at the moment.  That's a negative!

We came here and got a sampling of food.  The quesadilla's, touted as phoenix's best by the New Times were more like a smothered crispy taco with some cheese like you've never had inside.      A bit too much deep fried flavor for me though.  The rellenos were served in a bowl, smothered with a red sauce which was unique - not like you would find in the AZ/NM area.  Lot's of breading on the rellenos.  Not the best chiles. Meh.  Salsa.  A++.  The green stuff they bring out with the chips is eeeeexcellent.  The habanero from the salsa bar made me come back for a second time.  If you can stand the heat, make sure to try it on some of the tacos.  Al pastor and spicy chicken were the meats we chose.  Muah.  Unfortunately, the salsa cooking in the back made us leave the first time.  AHawk though she was having indigestion or something, but then starting choking and coughing.  Serious stuff here.

Rolled the dice one day and stopped in for lunch - payed off, big time.  They have great Vietnamese soups and vermicelli noodle bowls.  Family run place - nice people.  The owner has a cook book he co-authored on display at the front too - I'd like to try my hand at some soup one day.  The chocolate lava cake is most excellent.

We go here most every Friday morning.  Sometimes packed with college kids, but they behave themselves for the most part.  Breakfast weekday special is eggs with potatoes and a bagel.  It's a winner at a great price.    Wait staff is attentive and keeps the coffee hot and the soda cold.    Free pickle platter too!

The enchilada plate was very good.  Pasole was nice and spicy.  Good green chile.  They also sell roasted frozen chile here when available.

Great soup at a great price.  I go for the veggie soup normally, since I'm a bit leery of the raw meats and strange meatballs you can get.  Their vermicelli is also quite edible.  Service could be a little quicker.  Bring cash if you're spending less than $5 - with pho and water you will pay 3.50 + tax.  Cheapest lunch in town.

The owners seem to take pride in their craft.  Ever been to a place where the burrito had seven layers but they were arranged vertically?  Not here.  Items are put together with care and made to order.  Shredded beef and chile torta was great.

We we're served fermented salsa.  Unfortunately our 1.5 yr old didn't spot it.  When mom tasted it after a few minutes she freaked out a bit.  Serving spoiled food should is a huge problem!  At this point, the waiter should have been profusely apologizing and getting us margaritas.    The food is OK.  I tried some garlic shrimp and a relle√±o on a previous visit.  Average food, above average for Mesa I suppose.     The service has been slow and unapologetic on both visits, so I'll have to pass on this place from now on.
