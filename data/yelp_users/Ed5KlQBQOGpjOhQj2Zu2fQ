Staff has been friendly, helpful, informative. I love their pick up service. The gal that helped me (Hanna) was very sweet and when we went through the agreement before I left she made sure to touch on every detail possible including how to work my vehicle (which sadly another location had failed to provide this good of service). I am very appreciative of their customer service and when or if I am in need of a rental again will definitely come back to them.

This place is hands down one of the most professional and informative places I have ever been. I suffer from extreme anxiety and was very fearful to have an MRI. Their team put me at ease. I would never want to do it again...but if I had to, I'd be comfortable to come here knowing I will be taken care of. Kudos to your team making it the best experience possible for a not so fun situation!

I LOVE Kohl's. Been shopping here for years. This store in particular is always clean, staff is friendly and of course the prices are great. Best part is their customer service department. If you have to bring something back they don't ask you a million questions like you are a criminal. I often order on-line and return items to the store that don't fit right/don't work for me...it's always an easy process. As long as they keep having fair prices I'll be sure to shop here on a regular basis!

My poor baby got sick this weekend and it was life threatening. They were fast, informative and took great care of him. I do wish they were a little more affordable though.

Ordered lunch for the office today and it tasted fine, food was warm and arrived in a timely manner. Just wish their pricing was a little more competitive.

I'm giving it two stars only because for the most part the staff was friendly. Major issue was the food was cold when it got to the table, asked them to take it back to warm it up...about 5 mins later they bring it back and its still cold!! Had them take it back again (waited another 5 mins) and when it comes back its luke warm but not actually warm/hot like a fresh dish should be. I was with a group of people and by round two they were almost done with their meals so I just dealt with it and ate it as is...well, actually I didn't even completely eat my meal because I wasn't happy with it. I thought for sure the waitress would offer a discount for the issues but nope! Nothing.Never going back here!

Not sure why this location has such a low overall star rating but I found the staff to be friendly, the place to be clean (including the bathroom) and wait time wasn't too bad for a Saturday night (only 15 mins). Overall we (my husband and I) were pretty happy just wish the waitress was a little more on top of things...she did say she was new to town and that location so she didnt have knowledge of certain things just yet regarding that particular location.

It's ok- nothing amazing about the food but the staff is friendly, they are quick and the prices are decent.

For a place that prides itself on their Sicilian style pizza, I have to say I am VERY disappointed. There is a fine line between the fluffy and sponge like consistency that Sicilian pizza should be to the RAW dough that we got...twice. We ordered from them, they delivered our Sicilian pizza and the second bite was RAW dough. We called them, customer service was good- they put a second order in no charge and we were happy....until the second pizza was also RAW!!!!!!!! We have been trying multiple pizza places in our area and have been unhappy, was hoping this place was going to be our "go to" but sadly I have to report we will never order from them again. We ended up just throwing it all away, what a waste of food!!!

The owner personally contacted me and offered an explanation to their error. Also offered a free pie. I would rate higher but I haven't tried it yet so will wait until I know...standby :)

We use to order from this place at least once a week and loved everything about it- great food, decent prices, good service... but then something drastically changed and they started to get our orders wrong, they were difficult to work with and incredibly rude on the phone. They even hung up on us once! We have taken our business elsewhere and although we are paying more now, we are happy with our decision.

If I could give this place a NEGATIVE 5 star review, I would! It's been about 3 months since our last experience so we decided to give this place another chance since we had once enjoyed it so much PLUS our options are limited in our area. We ordered off their on-line menu assuming everything was accurate and if it wasn't they would contact us to explain as all good customer service driven companies do. When the order arrived it was wrong...AGAIN!!! My husband calls them and politely explains we just want it corrected. Not asking for money back or any unreasonable request beyond good customer service and to do what is right. The gal that answered (Rosie Wilson) argues with my husband the entire time telling him he is wrong and there is nothing they can or are willing to do to make it right. REALLY!? What the hell kind of business are your running!? I work as an Operations Manager and implement our customer service policies and procedures. I can tell you first hand the way this situation was handled was completely inappropriate! If someone in my company treated customers with half the disrespect we received, not only would I make it right with the customer but that employee would be fired on the spot! We didn't want anything for free (would have gladly returned the wrong pizza), we didn't ask for anything unreasonable (just want what we ordered and paid $40 for), and instead what we got was incredibly RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL treatment. I am all about second and sometimes even third chances but there is no way in hell I will EVER spend a dime at this place again and you damn sure better believe I will spread the news!!! Hey Farmhouse, if you knew ANYTHING at all about customer service you would know that if you are lucky a happy customer will share their experience with one or two people, but an UNHAPPY customer will share their experience with 10+ (usually anyone that will listen). In other words, not only did you lose our business but you have successfully lost at minimum 10 other customers on top of that. Kudos to you for digging your hole deeper...it will only be a matter of time until your doors close if you keep operating this way!

This place is pretty darn good. Always friendly on the phones, they deliver fast, haven't messed up an order once...and their fried pickles are AWESOME. The only way they could get better is to lower the pricing a tad as they do seem to be a little over priced compared to other places.

Yummy food, nice staff, fun atmosphere. Wish the outdoor seating was cooled better (even with the misters it gets very hot/uncomfortable) and that the pricing was a little lower, but overall I'm pleased with this place and go often.

Healed as expected. In a pinch, I'd go here again.

Unfortunately had to come here again due to a car accident I was in earlier in the day that resulted in major muscle pain. I didn't have an appointment and the visit was a Friday night, but the staff was friendly and the wait wasn't too long.
