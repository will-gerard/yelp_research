I've never posted a review on Yelp before this. I've never felt the need to, honestly. But something has to be said about this.   Let me start by saying that the service and staff get 5 stars. They were accommodating for our very large party and on point for getting our orders out quickly.  I ordered the Fish "Tacos". A taco. How can anyone Eff up a taco? At the most basic its a corn (or flour) tortilla, folded in half with a filling of some sort. It's a basic Mexican dish.  Unless you come to Zipps. Someone decided to make the "taco" into a burrito and call it a "taco".  A tasteless, bland, burrito served with greasy chips and what tasted like bottled salsa on the side. The chipotle sauce was equally bland and in need of salt and acid. Look, if you can't put pepperoni, mushrooms, cheese and garlic in a tortilla and roll it up and called it a "pizza" then you can't call this a TACO. I would be more forgiving if it actually tasted good.  If I could solely rate on service, these guys are amazing!!

We went  to Lucille's for lunch last weekend and overall it was pretty good. The biscuits and apple butter are not bad. Personally I would like to see them served with real apple butter but that's just a texture thing for me. We had a small order of wings with the mustard based BBQ sauce (can't remember the name) and they were REALLY tasty. The wings were still crunchy and the sauce was surprising in the best way.   I had the fried catfish...it was just ok. Too much batter and the fish and batter both needed salt. The portions are massive so I think if we go back we will most likely split something.    The staff was very attentive and friendly. The manager was a little surly but maybe she was having a bad day.   All in all - a good time was had by all!
