One evening on the way back from Sedona I stopped here for some pie and a coffee.  It was about 50min before closing but followed a few other last minute "pie-goers" in the door.    Cute and cozy old western interior.  Cracker Barrel-esque, warm and inviting.    I spot on the menu RHUBARB CRUB PIE!!! I can't believe my eyes!!!!  My grandmother would always get rhubarb pie from a local farmers market.  I have been on a search for good rhubarb for a long time.  Let me tell you it was LOVE AT FIRST BITE!!!!    Their pie crust is out of this world!!!  The crumb topping, TO DIE FOR!!!    I have had my fair share of pie and this TAKES THE CAKE!    Here is the pie list:  -Apple  -Apple Crumb -Banana Cream -Blackberry -Blueberry -Blueberry Crumb -Cherry -Cherry Crumb -Chocolate Cream -Coconut Cream Jack Daniels Pecan  -Lemon Meringue  -Mixed Berry Crumb -Peach -Peach Crumb -Pecan -Pumpkin  -Rhubarb  -Rhubarb Crumb -Tennessee Lemon Pie  They have coolers filled with whole pies and slices to go.  Well worth the trip and you will be coming back for more!

Goodies galore at My Sister's Attic!  Very impressive selection of designer labels and very organized.  The latest denim names to Louis Vuitton gently used bags.  I plan to revisit when I have more time.  Very friendly staff also!

I really hate to give anyone this bad of a rating but it is the truth.  I sat at the bar to have a drink while waiting for my friend and was greeted by a drone of a bartender who seemed annoyed that I wanted a drink.  REALLY??? While enjoying my cocktail, I noticed that every table in the bar had towers of dirty plates and glasses.  There was not a bus person or wait staff to be found cleaning.  A crowd of employees were hovered over a coworkers cell phone.  When my friend arrives we decide to move to a bar table that was clean.  The bartender wouldn't allow us to transfer our tab to a table 3 feet away.  We should have left after that but we were very hungry.  We finally order and as we were waiting a server dropped a tray full of wine glasses.  Glass shattered everywhere!  Under our table and on my lap. It was quickly cleaned   My friend arrives to save me from the already poor experience.  He orders a drink from our personality deprived bartender.  We are not ever offered a menu or a napkin, basically ignored.  We decide to move to a finally cleared bar table in hopes of getting service.   WRONG!!!!  We sat for ten minutes with a waitress passing us several times.  I finally grab menus .  As we are looking over the menus a server drops a tray of wine glasses next to our table.  Glass landed on my lap and all around our table.  I understand it was an accident, but never received a slight concern by the five employees gathered around the mess.  Not even the manager!!!! The waitress finally makes her way over to our table and  and the first thing she says is do you have a tab at the bar because I will have to transfer it.  WOW!  Really??? We order apps, they come out cold.  Dinner was fair and at this point I'm over the experience.  We stay to chat a bit after dinner to get asked by the waitress if we were done because she needed to leave like 5 mins ago.  Living back in Ohio I loved to go to Maggiano's but this location needs to step it up!  I have had several clients share what poor management and subpar service.  Yelpers BEWARE!

If you love Chicago Vienna beef hotdogs this is the place :-) super cute deli style interior, friendly staff, flat screen tvs and neon signs make for a great dining on the go experience.

Antoinette you are my hair angel!  If you're looking for a stylist that listens and goes above and beyond, look no further!! Her cut and color skills are ridiculously amazing!!!  She makes you feel right at home in her chair and gives the best head massages. I can't say enough amazing things about this magical lady!

Located in the beautiful Borgata of Scottsdale. Stopped here for lunch today and chose to enjoy  the beautiful tree covered patio.  Nice selection of  apps, salads and sandwiches.  Decided to start lunch off with a refreshing glass of passion fruit ice tea, absolutely delish!!!!  Followed by the turkey burger topped with brie.  The first bite was a beautiful mixture of moist turkey herb infused patty with a smooth finish of  a great brie.  Served with a great selection of fresh steamed veggies =0) YUM!!!!  To top off an amazing lunch and beautiful location, our server was such a sweetheart.  Make sure to ask if Theresa is working, an impressive ballroom dance competitor and teacher.  Cheers!

A friend invited me to The Compound to listen to the amazing Chuck Hall Band.  I had no idea what to expect due to no time to Yelp beforehand.  Plenty of parking and pleasant landscape greet you upon opening the front door. I arrived at the time Chuck Hall was due on stage and didn't have to pay a cover :-) friends held a table right in front of the stage. I love that this venue is spacious and inviting with tv screens playing streaming video of live concerts prior to the band taking stage.  Drink menu offered a nice selection and was not overwhelming.  I ordered their Cruz margarita, only $3.....woo hoo!!!!!  And quite yummy I might add.    I will have to agree with other yelpers that the service was very slow.  It took a good 20 mins to flag down a server, with several empty handed ones passing by.  After ordering our drinks it took another good 15 min to get them :-( I work in the food industry and tend to be picky but I fully understand off days.  The place wasn't packed and didn't seem under staffed so I don't know what was up.   Ok, margarita time !!!!! With drink in hand I  stroll across their yummy menu filled with many options. Far from boring bar food!!! I  selected the guacamole and chips for starters.  Feeling festive I order the ten mini tacos and mix up the meat fillings, chicken, salmon, shredded pork and beef.    The speed of the food was far faster than the drinks!  Guacamole was served with a generous helping of delicious chips fir dipping. Guac was good, just needed a little sea salt. The tacos arrived within 5 mins of the guac.... Now on my second margarita and feeling the blues being delivered, I'm a happy camper. The tacos were amazing, plenty of punched packed in a mini size!    The band sounded great here.  Not too loud and super clear.  The servers seem to go  astray when the band was playing and was super hard to get a drink.  Service seemed to get worse at this point.  We had more offers to take our unfinished plates than to order drinks.  Weird!!!  All in all I would go back to see another band play and give the service another college try!

RUDE! RUDE! RUDE!  I had a poor experience there and called the owner of my experience.  I kindly explained my situation at his restaurant.  I never got an apology, I'm sorry, nothing!!!  I work for a five diamond restaurant and have never been treated so poorly, ever!  Please do not support places that treat their customers like this.

Strato is a true miracle worker and his reiki treatments have helped me in so many ways. I've had massages all over the world and Strato is by far the best in the business. His energy work is a blessing and he is so passionate about his work. I always feel a sense of calm and more centered after every treatment. Do yourself and your spirit a favor, and pay him a visit.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, Snooze has THE BEST SERVICE!!!! Sitting at the bar having Andy take care of you is a real treat. He's always smiling and  never too busy to make sure your content with your meal. An addition to the service the food is delish!!!  I have a gluten allergy and this is hands down my favorite breakfast spot. I get to enjoy the most amazing eggs Benedict and mouthwatering gf pancakes. Do yourself a favor and try the gluten free cinnamon roll pancakes. I promise you won't regret it :)

Ridiculously fresh sushi! Great staff and a wonderful atmosphere. Some of the best sushi I've had in Arizona and they have gluten free soy sauce. They are new, yet already mighty. This will definitely be my go to sushi spot from now on.
