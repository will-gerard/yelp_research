I've eaten here twice once for dinner and once for lunch.   I like them because not only do they have good food but it's fairly inexpensive.  I was able to get a lunch special which included a drink and soup plus an entre for $5.95 which is an AWESOME deal!  I will definitely eat here again.

I was having a problem with our koi fish and determining how to treat it.  I went to a 'koi pond' specialist on the west side who will remain nameless.  Instead of 'helping' me I felt they just wanted to take advantage of the fact that I was a little clueless and desperate since I didn't want to loose my fish.  They  charged me $25 to do a 'scale test' so they could tell me I had Chilodonella and sold me 5 lbs of salt for $5.  When I called to tell her the salt treatment wasn't working and was trying to get some questions answered she said to come back in and do another scale test for another $25....that seemed ridiculous to me and then I remember Aquarium Arts.  They had helped me out many years ago when I had fresh water fish.  I went down there spoke to one of the guys, he took his time and answered ALL my questions for FREE , what a concept! We put our heads together and agreed that an FMG (QuickCure) treatment might do the trick....so basically for less than $3 I fixed the problem.  If you ever have a problem with your fish these guys are great at  answering all questions and pretty knowledgeable.  I am definitely making sure that in the future I support this mom n pop business!

A little on the expensive side.. 2 small basic (not restaurant style more fast food ) hamburgers and 1 fries, no drinks , was $17!! The rest was cool for a quick visit. GREAT views for pictures.  Overall a good experience I would not recommend eating there though.

If you sign up for their rewards program you will get $$ back and 20% off coupon for ALL your shopping on special days so it's a pretty good deal.  This store is well stocked and clean.

I needed a  quite place to eat lunch and finish some work with my laptop so I yelped places with Wi-Fi near me and Chase's Diner came up.  It's a nice place with a 50s theme including the booths and memorabilia.  Menu items were primarily American style cuisine so hamburgers with fries etc.  I tried the mushroom burger it was pretty good but a lil dry.  The plate was MASSIVE and I ended up taking 1/2 of it home.  Overall it was a good  experience, the Wi-Fi worked great only wished they had a little more healthy meals on the menu but I don't fault them for that since the traditional Americana foods are rarely good for your waistline.

Pros: Location, location, location...can't beat sitting next to a beautiful lake (albeit fake) and enjoy the weather and the ducks. They have Wi-Fi.  Cons: Coffee is ok nothing special.   You only get a cup of hot water and a tea bag if you ask for tea, they don't brew it or boil the water.  One of my pet peeves here is that they have hardly any food!  It's the same crap every week, baklava and other really sugary things.  Wish they had sandwiches or some real food besides sweets. If you wanna enjoy the ducks and lake there is a good chance you will also be enjoying someone else's smoke.  This can get annoying quickly specially if you have a whole table that's smoking next to you or if someone has cigars. If you go early in the mornings you tend to avoid these people.  Service?  It depends who you get.  Most of the staff is pretty cool and mellow, the owners on the other hand can sometimes be abrupt and some what rude.  They don't like you hanging around for too long.  As for the Wi-Fi, I went in once bought a latte and some cake thing and asked for a WI-Fi connection # (you need it to log into their network).  I sat down with my laptop and iphone and realized  I was going to need another Wi-Fi connection # cuz I was planning on updating my iphone while I was there and they make you get a # for each device.   I immediately went back to the line and asked the girl for another Wi-Fi connection # at which point she told me I would have to spend at least another $3 in order for her to give it to me since that was their policy.  I had just spent $7 for that coffee and stupid sweet thing  so as far as I could see I had met their policy.  A lady in line with her husband agreed with me since she remembered me being in line ahead of her and told the girl to just give me her # since she didn't think they were being reasonable either.  This place has a lot of potential and they would get a higher rating from me if they would address some of these issues.

Many choices from Housewares to all types of women's clothing.  They also have a great Christmas section with Department 56 and other collectibles.  Layout is easy to follow with two stories and most brands you can think of.  Good place to shop.

I don't shell out 5 stars often because most businesses don't go out of their way for customers or have extraordinary products or services than other stores but I have found this Lowe's store to be different in that regard.  They DO go out of their way for their customers.  Within the past year I have spent  $5k in misc household stuff.  No matter how organized you are keeping all those receipts handy can be a problem so I'm happy to announce that EVERY time I had tried to return anything they did it no problems.  Customer service is important to them and it shows.  When I purchased a dryer and it went on sale in another color I liked better the manager of that department made arrangements for the delivery company to pick up and return it when they delivered the other new one.  This was IMMENSELY helpful since getting a dryer back to the store for a return in my car would have been close to impossible.  By the way the manager did this without me having to ask him which was even better.  I also love that their plants go on sale if they are past their blooming season or slightly withered with 50-75%...Home Depot doesn't do this.  I saved hundreds of $$ with this and was able to fully stock my backyard for $500...at a normal nursery it would have been closer to $2k.  Overall very happy with Lowe's and plan to continue my escapades there :)

Another FAIL for this store.  They won't return or exchange an item they know is their's because it doesn't have a tag even it hasn't been worn or shows any signs of wear also I have the original receipt and am STILL within the return period.  RIDICULOUS

I've been getting my hair done by Launey for 10+ yrs now so clearly I like his work.  He  primarily cuts and styles my hair.  He also does one of my best friend's hair, a friend of my mom's hair and his sister used to do another GF of mine's hair before she moved.  The best thing I like about him as a stylist is that if you tell him to cut off 1/2 inch that's what he cuts no more no less.  Cutting "too much" has NEVER been an issue with him.  He's really good like that.  He is also the only person in town that I have found that can round brush my hair and it actually stays put.  With other stylists  they don't have that much strength in their wrist so they relay heavily on hair spray which I'm not a big fan of because after a 1 day my hair looks oily.  He's really cool about experimenting with different styles but make sure you know what you want before hand cuz I can guarantee you there is someone waiting after you and he's not going to have tons of time to help you decide.   Only negative on him would be getting scheduled.  Usually doesn't have that many openings and you have to wait a week or so.  He will not be able to do you on short notice so don't even bother.  Overall I have recommended him to several people.

I wish they had a lil bit more art but not really complaining since they put on special exhibitions on a regular basis so you get to see a lot of cool stuff like Ansel Adam photographs, most recently Leonardo da Vinci's Codex Leicester manuscripts, Hollywood costume, Egyptian treasures, Andy Warhol Portraits and many more. For most of the special exhibitions there is a fee but I don't mind since a lot of times there are fees to enter other museums state side and abroad.  I don't know if they still rent out the space for private parties but my old job had its Xmas party here and it was by far the coolest place to have it.    If you are in the area, it's worth a quick stop.

I've been coming here for several years and the owners are very friendly.  Overall the food is good and they have oysters, crab legs, mussels and over seafood every evening.  Prices aren't bad either.... around $7.99 for lunch and $9.99 for dinner..it's a pretty good deal.  They also have a bonus card that entitles you to a free meal after 10 visits.   My only negative is I wish they would clean a little quicker.  I know this is not their fault because I've seen some of the gross families that come and literally when they leave there is food on the chairs, wall, table and floor...personally I'd kick these pigs out but I'm sure they'd complain and call it discrimination.  I think the staff tries their best to keep up but it still shows.  Overall a good place to eat a budget friendly meal.

I know a lot of people have had bad experiences with Fry's Electronics and to be honest when they first opened (back in the 90s?) their return policy sucked so I wasn't a  big fan but now for several years they have been pretty good in my book.  Returns are fairly easy and comparable to other big box stores.  Just as long as you have your receipt or the card you purchased the items with they usually do an easy return.  Personally I do not buy items that have the return label on them...ever... since I've had problems with these in the past.    Another thing I like about them is that they generally will match the big online advertisers on price so for the past year I rarely pay the floor price but rather the best online price.  I'm HAPPY with that since I get to enjoy my new purchase that same day  vs having to wait for it in the mail.    Overall I think they have done a good job at improving their customer service skills in the past decade and because of their price matching they are the only store in the valley I buy electronics from.

Since I have another Westcor  mall just 5 minutes away from me I don't venture to this mall often but it is one of my favorites because of the diverse stores.  There are high end stores such as Tiffany, LV and Cartier to the basics like Banana R and Victoria's Secret.  You can find pretty much everything you need here. And did I mention it has the LARGEST Dillard's department store in the country?  This is their flagship store and it's huge...you can walk in there for a few hours and get tired before you've seen the whole store.   So if you are new to Phoenix or a tourist stop by you won't be disappointed.

Love this place, HOT cheap yummy burgers ..what more could you want? Food is good, but it bothers me to see these poor people outside in the heat having to take people's orders.  This is a complaint in general for all in-n-out burgers so minus 1 star...otherwise great.

I came in today to look at the T@Bs and I spoke with Matt Duncan the general manager.  He was awesome!! I asked a million questions and he took the time & answered all of them; he didn't seem rude and definitely had patience for me so that was great. I am definitely buying one this yr  and hopefully he will still be there.  They were great; if you're looking for a tab or on rpod this is the place to buy them.

Steve the owner came out and sprayed for bees.  The way he sprays he doesn't get all the bees at once so he did have to come back for a 2nd treatment (free of charge) and then did kill all the bees but for that 1 day in between they were pretty pissed off and stung my neighbor.  We were too scared to go through the front door since that was where they were.  I would have preferred for them to have them all taken care of on the first visit but he did explain why that wasn't a good idea.  At the end of the day they were taken care of and haven't been a problem since.

I remember when these guys were at 19th Ave and Bethany on the West Side....too far for me to go often so I'm glad they opened up a new store here on the East side in Mesa.    This is a great place to come if you are looking for cheap but NEW clothing.  They have men's, women's and children's clothing all between 50-90% off the normal department store retail price .  You can also find some bedding, table linens, and shoes but they primarily carry clothing.  They also run monthly 'specials' so for example when I was there they had an additional 50% off dresses and 40% off women's tops.  I picked up an Antonio Melani  silk blouse listed for $41.65 and then at the register they took another 40% off that  price so it ended up costing $25.  Not bad for something that originally cost $119 so basically I got it for 80% off :)   Like any other bargain discount store you will have to search for those treasures and this place is sooooo BIG you will probably shop till you drop so bring comfy shoes and enjoy your treasure hunt!

Full disclosure, I did not eat at the restaurant but I purchased his tamales at a Farmer's market.. My neighbor kept on raving about them and so I figured alright, I'll bite.  They are really good and a bit addicting! She said he doesn't use lard and I couldn't taste any.  I'm not big on Mexican food or spicy primarily because they tend to make me sick but not this one.  I had the chicken and green chilli and they were DEELISH, not spicy at all.  Highly recommend.

This was my first time coming here and I thought it was pretty good.  It's more like a mini farm inside a BIG GARDEN.  Maybe it's because we are getting close to summer so we didn't see that many veggies but the flowers made up for it in droves.  It felt like I was Alex In Wonderland ^_^  HUGE flowers, not sure what they are called, but more than 6 feet tall and you get to walk through them ~ AWESOME.  They also have lots a cute garden art everywhere in addition to chickens, horses and even peacocks!  If I had kids this is where I'd bring them to let their imaginations run free.  Even with the crowds you could play hide n seek in this place no problem.  It rained a lot last night so we almost didn't go thinking about the mud etc but I'm GLAD we did because the rain really brought out the aromatic elements of this garden... it felt very "woodsy" with all the wet mulch and flowers/plants.  I'll definitely be coming back with some friends to spend some more time here.  TIP:  If you want to get the best veggie selection from the Farmer's Market get there EARLY.  By the time we got there 10:30am lots of the veggies were gone.

It's been 8 minutes and counting and they STILL haven't taken my order. Joy I'm gonna be late for wk this AM *thanks* McDonalds on 51 & Elliot!  ------------------------- UPDATE  It took another 8 minutes to get my food that day for a total of 16 minutes to get out of there and YES I was late.  I do have to say that I did go back once since then and this time my order was quicker but they didn't have any customers so I'm not sure that's improvement or not.

I purchased a Groupon package discount for this school for partial highlights, pedicure and European Facial for $34.  So far I've had the highlights done and I was pleasantly surprised.  Usually when my guy does highlights I end up coming home and tweaking the color till the brassiness goes away so imagine my relief when I got home, looked in the mirror and I didn't have to do a thing. That was a great feeling! My  guy charges $95 but at this school I only paid $35 ...score :)  Keep in mind this is a school and they are STILL learning this is why you are only paying 1/2 the price.  Something else to keep in mind is TIME.  With my regular guy highlights, cut, blow dry and style usually takes around 2 hours....it took the girl 2 hours just to apply the bleach... total time 5 1/2 hours! Got in at 10am left at 3:30pm. Glad I didn't have anything else planned for the rest of the day but again I only paid a fraction of the price.  Pros: Cheap, cheap, cheap I received decent service but since they are students you never know  Cons: Time consuming....students go MUCH slower

I've been coming here on and off since they opened at the beginning of the recession.   In my opinion they pulled through because they are at a good location but also provide good service which is essential for continued success.  Pros: Cindy does some of the best nails I've seen and I'm not a big fan of acrylics.  Her main strength is that she listens to what her customers ask for and always delivers. I'll admit that I'm picky when it comes to nails.  I don't like them to look fake (duck nails) because of work and she always makes them look very natural.  Also she's GREAT with free hand art work.  I'll show her a picture from Pinterest and she'll copy it.  Another Pro is that the salon has a big staff to accommodate a large clientele.  CONS: Sometimes the staff is not as friendly as they could be.  I have a feeling this has more to do with being tired and over worked because they get very busy.  It's true that if you are a walk in at peak hours you could be waiting for over an hr for service.   My only complaint with this is I wish the staff was more open and honest and told you how long your wait will be AHEAD of time so you could make that decision to wait or not.   This usually doesn't affect me because I usually have an appt  but even then I have sat waiting 35 mins for my turn.  I do hear people getting upset sometimes for the long wait time and I can't blame them but what can you do they are a busy salon.  Overall I like it and even though I'm not a big fan of waiting I'll do it here because i do like her work.  TIP: If you come at 9 ish when they open there is never a wait ;)

Over the years I've been to several Wells Fargo branches and for the most part they are pretty friendly; this one is the exception.  I went in because I was having a problem with a  vendor charging my checking account and over drafting it.  Prior to this the only other time I have been charged a any fee was when they switched my account and the bank kept on billing me for a monthly fee in error which they reversed.  A girl sat down with me and went over my account.  She was courteous but kept on trying to get me to sign up for things.  I told her I was good but she continued for several minutes until finally she asked what she could do for me.  Funny thing is when I sat down I told her exactly why I was there.  I repeated why I was there and she looked through my account again, the previous ten minutes she looked at my account I guess was just to try to sell me something.  I explained to her about the bank errors fees being waived.  After a long pause she said she had to talk with her manager about reversing the fee and she got up and left.    Another 7-10 minutes later she comes back and says she couldn't waive the fee.  When I asked why? She said because they had already waived monthly fees.  AGAIN I explained to her that those were waived  because of a bank error.  I asked if I could speak to her manager but she said he was busy and couldn't talk with me.    At the end of the day the fee didn't bug me as much as the TREATMENT.  They had me there for 20 freakin minutes and this guy couldn't come out of his little back door to talk to me for 2 seconds?  Also,  if you weren't going to waive it why not tell the person in the first few minutes, why drag it out for so long?  In the end I called the 800# and they waived it right away. If the people at this branch had bothered to read the notes on my account like the agent at the call center did they could have resolved it then and there.  Instead they were inept and a total waste of time.

FOLLOW UP: Still a crap rating for this branch...about the NSF I called the 800# and they waived it right away. Today  went through the drive through against my better judgment and the teller LOST my drivers license. YUP she handed it  back to another car that drove off and since the guy just cashed a check and has no Wells Fargo account they don't have a way of getting ahold of him to get my license back. LUCKY me! Wells Fargo should just shut down this branch!

I drove up from Chandler to this place to buy broken plates for mosaics and it really wasn't worth field trip.   It felt like Black Friday with the crazy people except the crazy people are going nuts over other people's garbage.  There really wasn't anything there that was worth buying everything was broken, defective, stained.  They want   99 cents a pound for the clothes and 59 cents for the other items.  If you buy the non clothes they end up being more expensive than if you just bought them at a goodwill on 50% off Saturday so I don't think it's worth it.  I picked up a plate that was labeled 99 cents, on the 50 percent off sale days it would be $0.50 here however the plate was $1.30 because of its weight which really doesn't make any sense.  Wasn't sure what to rate it because I talked to one of the guys that works there and he says it's always crazy that they feel they need to get out of the away cuz people will just push them so I don't know that's not for me it's probably not for a lot of people but for some  specific type of people they might have fun here.  P.S. If you are going to venture out bring some workman's gloves because there are a LOT of broken glass items and other jagged objects in the bins that will cut you if you are not careful.

UPDATE: I'm changing my review of this place because they will not give you the lowest rate they advertise on a unit unless you move your stuff to that unit.  As you can image this can get old quick.  A few months ago I did just that, moved everything to a new unit to take advantage of the lower rate, now about 4 months later they INCREASED the rate  by 20% yet they still have the lower rate I signed up for  advertised for new customers.  When I called and inquired about this I was told that rates are not guaranteed and that they can increase.  Really? In just a few months? Well they might get $20 more from me this month but won't get a dime more in the future since I will be moving out and going elsewhere.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I've been renting here on and off for 10 years.  These guys not only usually have the Lowest a/c rates in the East Valley but they are also very clean, helpful and I feel my stuff (and myself) are pretty safe here. Also because its inside and air conditioned my stuff hasn't gotten damaged, minimal dust.  Go online to get the lowest rates.. usually 10-15% of the "office" rates. Also the upstairs rates are generally cheaper than downstairs but don't worry they have a big freight elevator.  Good place I would recommend it to anyone needing a/c storage.

Not bad, price was good... for 1 gyro came to $5.70ish with tax and it was a decent size, filled me up for sure.  Service for take out was quick so I would definitely try this place out again.

What can I say... I truly LOVE this store!  I find it hard to go in here and even though I tell myself I won't next time, I always end up spending $100 +..they have such great stuff!   I like the TJ Maxx solo stores too BUT I prefer the TJ Max/HomeGoods combo stores...TWICE THE FUN! TJ Max has the clothes while HomeGoods has all the cool decor items.  You can find anything in here from Himalayian Salt lamps to pillows from India, mirrors and furniture all at affordable prices... doesn't get better than this!!

These guys are only 1/2 a mile from my house so my mom and I have made them a regular stomping ground.  What I love about them is that they are QUICK so if you wanna grab some quick grub for lunch/ dinner you can since all the food is on a conveyor belt. This is not a franchised restaurant, it's a mom & pop shop with Japanese chefs in the back which you can see btw through the glass wall.  Sounds silly but it makes it feel more authentic to me.  Prices? They are not bad.. they range from $1-$3 for a plate of 3 rolls. Good luck finding good sushi elsewhere for that price ;)  If you don't like the conveyor belt you can also order a-la-carte from the menu. Lastly I found the quality of the sushi to be pretty good for the price.  One would think you would get pretty crappy sushi for the price but it's actually good. They also have their own in-house inventions such as the "Japanese Pizza sushi"    Pros: Good sushi for a low price allows you to be adventurous and try out different types of sushi you haven't tried before. Yummy Green tea (specially when ordered hot) You can eat fast-n-go  Cons: Small wait staff but usually this isn't an issue Mostly sushi on menu - not much alternatives but then again it IS a sushi bar

I came across this animal hospital when I was fostering dogs for P.A.W.S.  Even though they are quite far away from me (40 miles/1hr drive) I found them to be extremely helpful and more importantly affordable. Dr Notario is Awesome and very through when examing my dogs.  The only negative I have for them is their wait time which can sometimes be a few days since they are always booked but I guess that is a testament to how good they are.   I will continue to go to them and recommend them to anyone who is looking for affordable pet healthcare.

If you are stuck and need to pawn something this is really not the best place to go.  They charge 37% interest for 90 days.  So for ex: if you get $400 in pawn the interest and fees will run you  $153.  It's crazy that's basically more than a 1/3 of the cost of the item and if you have to renew it after 90 days you are going to be hurting.  The reason why I bring this up is because there are other pawn shops that only charge 16%, 22%. You'll need to call around to see who offers what.  One thing positive about this place is that they will take a lot of different things in for pawn from electronics, to tools, and jewelry. They also take in some higher end watches. For jewelry they pretty much just give you the value of the gold and a minimum value for stones. Not worth it if you have a ring with a really expensive stone.

Been coming here since the beginning, well technical my parents have since it was more than 20 yrs ago when it was called Roy's.  Overall good shop with competent service repair people.  My only draw back is that it seems I can never get out the door under $65 and I have to leave the mower for a week.  Not the cheapest or fastest in town but I would still recommend them since you might pay a bit more here but at least you know they will do a good job.
