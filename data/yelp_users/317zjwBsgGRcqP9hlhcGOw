This is my regular nail place. I really like the owner and how he does my manis and pedis. But I've tried all of the technicians here and they have all done a great job.

I've been seen Tony for the past month for a foot injury. Since day one Tony and the assistance have all made me feel very comfortable, They are attentive and feel like you've known them for a long time. Not only do you feel at home, but the work that they do on your injury actually does work! before physical therapy I wasn't able to walk for an extended period time without having pain on my lower Calf, slowly but surely it's been getting better.

This park is pretty awesome. It has museums, rides, food, and of course playgrounds. Visited on a random Saturday and they had all kinds of things going on, free bounce houses, petting zoos, magic shows, face painting, and minions! The kids loved it, my nephews face was priceless!

Great place, I used to work down the street and never came in, boy have I missed out.  I love their #42, just greasy vegetable noodles, but they are AMAZING!  It's a small hole in the wall place,  but service and food are great.  Try it out!

This is definetly a hole in the wall, the 5 stars are based on food, service is fast but not overly friendly. Love their Seafood Soup.

ZERO stars! Long wongs are independently owned, but if it was my name I would most definetly pull it from this place. I ordered via phone, and as soon as I walked in I wish I hadn't. This place is dirty, it smells like incense and it overall gives me the creeps. I paid for my order and ate one wing at home. It had almost no meat on it, it was though, and the sauce was nasty. Overall stay away!

This place is way too expensive for what it has to offer. $25 wristband, and all you get to do is go-karts, bumper boats and mini golf. Did I mention the wristband is not even an all day wristband....yup it has a four hour limit! Are you kidding me?   Save your money and go to Castles N Coasters, at least they have tons of rides, mini golf and I think all day wristbands are around the same price.

I'm not an A's fan, but when the cubs and the Dbacks were sold out we headed to Hohokam Park. I have to say the stadium is pretty nice, it's different than other spring training facilities since it actually has indoor corridors. The field itself is beautiful. The best part is the park faces East, and it has shade structure, so the 200 levels get shade all throughout the game and the lower levels get shade a little later in the game (1pm games).

I love their popusas! They are just a bit on the expensive side $2.30 each. Their Chicken Salad is also very good.

I've been here a few times and have tried various dishes. I have to say one of my favorites is the meatloaf...and I don't like meatloaf! Their side salads are also quite delicious, I think the crutons are sweet so it gives them a great flavor.

Viewing all these great reviews, leads me to one conclusion, people don't know what a good burrito taste like. I had a machaca burrito and it was way too dry. The meat was shredded but it was clumpy (is that a word?) and would stick to the roof of my mouth. My boyfriend had a taco of each of their meats, and he was surprised that even the carne asada was bad. Who messes up carne asada?  Take it from a Mexican who knows Mexican food and skip on this joint.

This little place is AMAZING! The food is cooked fresh as you order, I had the chicken adobada burrito, with guacamole and pico de gallo. Got to say the burrito not only tasted amazing, but the chicken was so tender and juicy that it left me begging for more.   Their salsa bar has 4 different types of salsa, pickled carrots and jalapenos, lemon and some othher stuff. I tried the green and chuncky red salsa, they were really good.   My only complaint is that I didn't find this place sooner...

Went here because of the Yelp reviews, was definetly not impressed. The atmosphere is dark like a bar, the food is below average. Sushi tasted like it had been sitting around for a while. I would NOT recommend this place.

This is definetly our go to breakfast place! Service is almost always great (have had a few under par experiences) , and the food is delicious. One of my favorites is the Santa Fe Idaho Skillet. It has hashbrowns, green chilis, eggs, cheese, chorizo...and I'm sure I'm missing a few other ingredients. Point of the matter is it's great! Eat here!

This is a beautiful trail about 60 minutes east of Tempe. The trip up the mountain is great in itself, but the trail is breathtaking. Great views of the Superstitions and Canyon lake, by far my most favorite lake. The hike is moderate I would say, and it runs 12 miles one way, although I've never done more than 3 miles in.

I've gone to Chili's in the past, but this was my first visit to this location. We stopped here after a day of hiking in the Superstitions.  First of all, the wait staff was great, very attentive and friendly. However, the food was not good. One of the dishes I regularly order at Chili's is the Margarita Chicken. I ordered this, and seriously it did not taste like any other Margarita Chicken I've ordered. The beans, are suppose to be black, these tasted like baked red beans, the ones you get from a can. The rice, I don't even know what was wrong with it, but it was disgusting! The chicken had this sauce on it, that I've never seen before. And it was kinda under done.   After this experience, I would not return to this location.

This place is really good. My first visit, I had a carne asada burrito. It was fresh and big, it was delicious. The girl at the counter was very pleasant. Their salsa bar is fully stocked. Definetly better than any *Bertos...

I love their Ramen soup! I always order their miso soup with spam, it's delicious! I've taken a few people here and they also like it.   My only complaint is that in the summer it feels like it's 80 degrees in there. After eating the soup, you come out sweating! Seriously you're selling soup in 105+ weather! The restaurant should be at least a chilly 75...don't be cheap and crank that AC!

Best Ice Cream EVER! I absolutely love their Laveen Concrete flavor, not a good name for it but it's DELICIOUS! Their shaved ice is amazing too! AND Scooptacular does a lot for their local community.   Great Ice Cream & Charitable business? What's not to love?

Great food. I had the french toast chiquita style (bananna & nutella), it was delicious! The bf had biscuits and gravy and they were delicious too. We've seen this place and never stopped, glad we finally did. It was delicious.

These burgers are delish! A litte hole in the wall with great burgers and great service. Try their french fries and onion rings too. This is the closest to a 'California' style burger as you'll get out in AZ.

I've been dying to check this place out,  and when I did I sat there for 20 minutes with multiple servers walking by, and chit chatting less than 10 yards away and none of them acknowledged me. I really wanted to like this place,  the views are awesome and the venue is loungey, however being ignored by servers sucks!

Great location. I love their beautiful produce, meat, fish, poultry, and deli. They have all kinds of gourmet meat and chicken available, you can just buy and put on the grill. Their prices are fair. Sprouts has definetly become our go to produce market.

I've gone in for a haircut and facial and both were fantastic. I understand these are students, and because of that I won't get color done here. However, the services I have received have been great.

Just moved to the area and was in search of a new chinnese place. This place is delicious. We ordered mongolian beef, chicken lo mein, sweet and sour chicken, and egg rolls. My only complaint is the sweet and sour chicken comes with sauce on the side and no veggies, making it pretty bland. Everything else was delicious!

This place has great fish tacos.  The tacos come plain, however their salsa bar has lots of toppings available. I especially liked their Chipotle sauce. The review that says the portions are small,  I don't know what they're referring to. The tortilla is a regular size corn tortilla,  and it is FILLED with delicious fried fish.   The restaurant is small and clean.  The owner I believe is very friendly and attentive.  Just the service alone makes you want to return again.

Sushi is just alright. Service leaves a lot to be desired. I stopped with a group of six, 3 couples. We all placed our order and their food arrived but ours hadn't. Apparently, the waiter took it to the wrong table TWICE! After waiting 40 minutes for sushi, we got fed up and left. Ended up eating at Burger King down the street.

I've been going to Sonoran Sky Dental for about two years now, and I really like Dr. Kim as well as the staff. The office staff is extremely accommodating and make you feel welcomed.   The hygenists are knowledgeable and answer any questions you might have.   Dr. Kim is very patient, and makes sure you understand everything.   I currently commute from Ahwatukee to this office because I know first hand how hard it is to find a good dentist!

We moved to some apartments nearby and found this gem. We truly love this pizza, the cheese tastes very fresh, the dough is thin but still fluffy, the toppings are truly delicious. We love their italian sausage!  Also their wings are delicious! We normally get their hot Bone-in wings (I never get boneless). Those wings are meaty, big, amd the sauce is on point. Also their garlic or cheesy bread is soft in the middle and crunchy on the outside...Man my mouth is wathering.

I love this place! Your food is crafted right in front of you,  and you have the choice of different types of meat.  You can also order your burrito enchilada style, and it's absolutely amazing!  The only draw back was the price,  expect to pay about $11 for a burrito and a drink.  However the burritos are huge and could easily be eaten in two meals,  or shared.

This place is a pretty awesome place. I've only been here once on a Friday night. The music is loud, the drinks keep coming, and you get to practice your swing.  I think I love this place.

Stopped by with my mom and had some popusas revueltas (pork, beans and cheese filled). They wdre delicious! We also got a side of fried bananas, and banana empanadas they were both really good.  The place is nice, roomy and very clean. You order at the counter and the food is brought out to you, but the server checks on you throughout your meal. Overall a very good meal and great service. Can't wait to return and try another entree.

I really like this location, like other yelpers said it's much more roomier than most. I went on Wacky Wednesday, and it was pretty busy. There was only one employee working, and she was swamped. She was still cheerful and helpful, but you did have to wait a while.

These donuts are amazing! They are so soft and airy and after you eat one you don't feel like you just ate a pound of bread, they are delicious! Normally in the valley the best donut shop has really been bosa donuts but I got to say Sunrise Donuts is blowing them out of the water!
