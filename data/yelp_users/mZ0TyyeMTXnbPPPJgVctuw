This place is a GEM! I've been going to Alice Rae off/on for years and they've always demonstrated outstanding customer service. Bra shopping isn't always fun, and the owner (Julia) is kind, compassionate, and exceptionally knowledgable about her products and how to successfully items to each woman's unique shape. I've never left the store disappointed, and I've sent friends to over the years who are also Alice Rae converts. I wish more people knew of this store because you leave feeling good about yourself and your body.

Absolutely loved it! We booked a stay-cation here with a group of friends and had a fabulous time. The staff was exceedingly polite and hospitable from the moment we stepped foot on the grounds. Good customer service goes a long way with me and I could not have asked for more. The property is gorgeous and the accommodations are everything you could hope for. All we wanted to do is hang out poolside with the kids and they had great time. Between the pool, the hot tub, and the water slide (which my almost three year old twins LOVED) everyone had fun. We've been to other resorts in Phoenix and this was by far the best. I can't wait to go back!

I work within walking distance and was never interested in a restaurant that involved a three hour wait for a meal. But now that they are open for lunch I went over a few weeks ago. I LOVE pizza. But I wasn't all that impressed. It was good. But I didn't think the pie lived up to the hype. Maybe my expectations were too high given all the rave reviews I had heard. But it wasn't blown away. And I certainly wouldn't wait 3+ hours for a meal.

My family is from Israel and over the years we've enjoyed a lot of fantastic Middle Eastern food. Eden's Grill has some of the BEST in town. Authentic, reasonably priced, and made with love and tradition. I've never had anything there that I didn't like. This one of my favorite places to send people.

Twice I've been to their pharmacy trying to get fairly common prescriptions filled (antibiotic for sinus infection and an anti-fungal cream) and twice I've arrived to pick up my 'script only to be told that they don't have the item in stock. One time they kept me waiting for 45 minutes with a sick child before they told me they didn't have what I need. Customer service was terrible and the pharmacy staff could have cared less. I won't be going back.

If you're looking for a basic manicure or spa pedicure De Bon Nails does a pretty good job. The prices are reasonable, it's comfortable, and relatively clean. If you're wanting acrylics, gel manicures, etc. you're better off going elsewhere. I started getting gel manicures over the summer. They're supposed to last 2-3 weeks. With one exception, the four I had done at De Bon Nails lasted a week before breaking/peeling. They never offered to fix them and when I asked why it was happening they just shrugged. The last time I went I suspect the woman giving me my manicure was being coached by the person sitting next to her (not 100% sure since they weren't speaking English). And I had three nails break off within five days. Since I started going elsewhere I haven't these problems. Which leads me to think it is the salon/manicurist as opposed to my nails.

This place is one of those "blink and you miss it" places. But the food is fantastic. I would not recommend their dining room, as I find the service rather slow. Which is why we often order our food takeout. The calzone's are our favorite and we end up with leftover for a few night. The breads and red sauce are fantastic! Very authentic.

We live around the corner and discovered the place about a year ago. The owner (Ben) is friendly and always makes it a point to say hello. We stick to the bagels and cream cheese which are warm, fresh and made locally. I recently brought a dozen bagels and cream cheese to work and my colleagues all wanted to know I bought them. This is a great neighborhood spot!

I've been to Eddie's House before and have always enjoyed the experience; good food, service and atmosphere. Last night we went to Eddie's House with another couple for dinner. During the meal one of our dining companions choked on a piece of lobster shell and his wife had to perform the Heimlich maneuver. It was scary, and thankfully he was fine. However, other than the waitress (who was genuinely concerned), no one came over to see if our friend was okay. Eddie Matney was at the restaurant and we saw the waitress tell him what happened. Yet he never came over to check on us and see if our friend was ok. We weren't looking for a free meal or anything like that. . .but we were floored by the lack of customer service displayed by the chef/owner and the management. Very disappointing.

Love the yogurt, LOATHE the staff. Rude, disinterested, and condescending. Last time we were there I used the experience to educate my son about customer service and why it's important. Expecting a high school (college?) kid to smile, greet the customer and be pleasant as they're ringing up my fro-yo really isn't a lot to ask. And I blame the management because they tolerate the rudeness. Normally I wouldn't patronize a place with lousy customer service, but I keep coming back ONLY because it's the only frozen yogurt place in my neighborhood.

Clean. Professional. Made me comfortable since I was a first time visitor. I could have done without the snotty front desk girls, but the esthetician was friendly and nice.

We've been at North Valley gymnastics for just over a year a couldn't be happier with the owners, the facility and the coaches. We had been planning to enroll our daughter's at another gym when we we heard about NVG. I asked around and the response from people was very positive so we tried it out. Kids liked it and so did we. After a few months, we grew a little concerned with the kinder gym program because it seemed like the same stuff week after week. And many of the activities were what you'd expect at Gymboree. Around this time a new kinder gym director was hired and the difference was immediate. Now, the kids are working on specific skills and we are seeing a definite progression from one week to the next. Coach Jenna is fantastic with the kids....positive, enthusiastic, and she genuinely enjoys them. My kids adore her!  The facility is spacious, clean, and safe. Is a positive atmosphere that is a fostering a love for the sport.

With three small children it's sometimes hard to find activities that they can all enjoy at the same time that don't break the bank. We stubled on Play Factory a few months ago when it first opened at Desert Ridge and I am thrilled that they are in the neighborhood. It's clean, air conditioned, and the layout is such that you can watch multpple children at the same time. My twins LOVE the indoor rock wall. They're 2 1/2 and the wall is designed so that older and younger kids can play. The staff also did a great job of helping them so that they could be successful (even if they only got 12 inches off the ground).  Another reason we like Play Factory is Toddler Tuesday. . .kids have unlimited play for $5/each. Not a bad deal. And Desert Ridge is an ideal location. There are tons of kid-friendly restaurants (fthere is also a snack bar at Play Factory) and a splash pad within walking distance.

I love this place. Evey time we go the staff is terrific and the food of great. And the bacon donuts don't disappoint. For me, Oink is great alternative to IHOP (meh) and Chompie's (good, but overwhelming). It's a locally-owned neighborhood spot for a good breakfast in an intimate setting. We've never had an issue with the food or the service. When we were there last month the owner was walking to each table, talking to customers, and just making sure they/we were ok. This morning we went with friends and the GM was doing the same thing. He stopped at our table, made a genuine effort to talk to us and our kids (making a big to-do about hanging their pig pictures on the wall), and made sure we were well taken care of. Stuff like this goes a long way with me, and is a big reason why I will keep coming back. I always order the Pig in a Blanket which never disappoints. Love this place! There have been so many restaurants come and go in this space over the years. . . .I hope this one stays for a while.

Found a special on the website and decided to book Gamez on Wheelz for my son's 10th birthday. This was one of the best and least-stressful parties we've ever thrown. The kids had a BLAST and could have easily spent the entire day in truck playing video games. Our party host (Jason) was on time, personable and terrific with the kids. He set-up the truck within minutes and from there it was 120 uninterrupted video-game bliss. Best of all was that our son and all of his friends had a good time. I would not hesitate to book another party with Gamez on Wheelz, or recommend them to my friends. Thank you!

I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and today I had my chance. They didn't disappoint. Pizza was awesome! Flavorful, good crust, and and the the house salad was a perfect compliment. Good service and ambience and it was a lovely work lunch.

My experience with Michael's was TOP NOTCH from beginning to end. Everyone on staff (especially Michael & Jamie) went above and beyond to take care of our vehicle. They got us into a rental (snagged and upgraded vehicle too!), did beautiful work and called us halfway through the process after identifying another issue with the body of the vehicle to see if and how we wanted it fixed. Costs were reasonable and well-explained. I will never go anywhere else. They are honest, professional and a local business I am happy to support.

For years my husband and I have complained about the lack of good, inexpensive Chinese food in town. Not anymore! The food and ambience may not be as fancy as other places in town, but it's good, reasonably priced, fast and the staff is lovely. We've tried a variety of chicken, beef and vegetarian dishes and they're all great. Best of all? While our friends were preordering their Christmas Day-Chinese food dinner 4 hours in advance we called China Jade and 20 minutes later picked up our food. No wait or fuss. And the food was delicious! They even deliver!

I've been seeing Dr. Carter since 2008, after several friend's recommended him to me. I couldn't be happier with the care I've received and the professionalism of his staff. Let's be honest. . . going to the OBGYN isn't  the most comfortable of experiences. I'm fully convinced that the world would be a much different place if men were asked to get naked and put their feet in stirrups while a speculum is used to explore their manhood (on an annual basis). Dr. Carter delivered two of my three kids and has managed my care ever since. I find him to be knowledgeable, sensitive and respectful of my choices. In addition to having an excellent bedside manner, Dr. Carter and his staff take time to ask questions and really listen patients; a sentiment that is shared by friends who also use this practice. They take their time to get to know their patients and don't rush you in and out to make room for the next person. Can't think of a bad word to say about the practice.
