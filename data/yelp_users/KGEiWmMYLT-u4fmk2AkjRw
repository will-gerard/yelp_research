I have to tell you, as a framing artist finding a great frame shop (and a gallery too!) is worth any amount of trouble. THIS IS IT! Even OTHER frame shops referred me here. Can't get much more of an endorsement than that. Pat was SO helpful, steering me to the right frame at a great price - landed cost was about what I would have paid to frame it myself! Unbelievable! And if you're looking for art, do yourself a favor and check out this gallery. Amazing photography, gorgeous oils, huge giclees for a fraction of what you'd pay at the art shows, not to mention Scottsdale/Sedona/Jerome galleries - very high quality work at very reasonable prices. You will thank me! I live over an hour from Esprit Decor but I promise you I will never go anywhere else! (You should see my piece - really, it went from "Oh, that's a nice piece " to "Wow, can I buy that?" in about 15 minutes! )

If I could give them 0 stars I would. It's not just bad service (and read the reviews, the service is beyond bad, it's insulting) these people are CROOKS. I used to live near one of these places and took my car in for an oil change and to have a squeaky belt replaced. I was told my car needed over $600 of service (too long a list to type here) and that "All my belts" needed changing. I said, "Oh, really" All of them?" And the mechanic replied "Yes, you should do all of them at once, and it's $375." People, my car has ONE belt. I took it to my regular mechanic and he installed it for free (it took about 10 minutes, and he charged me $20 for the belt!) along with replacing the old oil filter Fletcher's left on the car. RIP OFF WITH A BAD ATTITUDE!

I went to this place because I bought a Groupon for 30 Dysport units (just enough to treat the frown lines between my brows.). I arrived 15 minutes early for my 5:00 appointment. I FINALLY got in for my FIVE MINUTE PROCEDURE at 6:05 - and then waited longer for the doctor to appear - making us late for my husband's physical therapy appointment. The receptionist - after the third time I asked how much longer it would be - finally deigned to tell me "Oh, we're running about 15 minutes behind". Meanwhile 5 people went in ahead of me. After getting into the room, I noticed things looked a just little shabby, and there was an (open!) syringe on the counter. I should have insisted that I be allowed to watch the draw of the product - but, foolish me, I trusted all was as it should be. When the doctor finally appeared she was pleasant enough, though she tried very hard to talk me into an additional Dysport injection in my forehead I declined. Now, 2 days later, I have yet to see ANY results, which leads me to suspect either the Dysport wasn't applied properly or perhaps I didn't get the full dosage. I've used this product several times in the past and usually only require 20 units of Dysport (and about 10 of Botox) to treat those minimal lines. All in all, a frustrating spend of our limited time. I won't return.

COURTNEY has been doing my brows for months now, and has always done a great job for me. She's attentive and listens to what I want. I like a natural looking brow, but clean and precise and absolutely NOT over-plucked or over-waxed. My brow hairs are not the thickest so getting juuuust the right ones is crucial... easy to make them look too thin.and just as easy to let one or 2 stray hairs create unpleasant shadows. I've also had the unpleasant experience of lingering redness and irritation - but not with Courtney. I am older so my skin is more fragile; somehow she managed to take that into account and kept the irritation to a minimum. I will certainly go back!

Have been coming here for years (my husband too) and have spent thousands. Got a prescription filled incorrectly - perhaps because it was a temp doc? (of course they say not) as it did not match my sample contacts. I wore the old scrip for a couple of months before I found the sample box in a drawer and realized why I had been seeing so poorly. Called to see what could be done and they said "Our doc is not accredited so you have to pay for a new exam, we can't bill insurance." "We gave you the right prescription." "You have to come in for a new exam but we can't get you in until next week."  "Go to some other Nationwide, they're all the same." I think I will try Costco for an exam - see how quick they can get me in - and order online. I'll probably save a bundle as well as a ton  of aggravation.  Discouraging that after so long as a patient there's no recourse. Buyer beware.

Here's the problem: This is in a DICEY neighborhood, right at the edge of a BAD neighborhood. Two friends of mine were ABDUCTED AT GUNPOINT from this "lovely patio" about a month ago. Look it up in the AZ Republic if you don't believe me. One managed to escape being driven down a dark alley (for what purpose??) after being forced to empty her bank account, and managed to run to a store where they called the police, who rescued her friend. Ladies, I would say do not sit on this patio alone after nightfall. BTW, the owners avoided calling the girls back and there was not so much as an "are they ok" when their sister called to let them know there had been a problem. they were worried they might ask for something, apparently. Nice!

I wish I could figure out a way to post the picture of the curly, kinky black hair I found in my takeout AFTER I had eaten most of it. Maybe then I could also figure out a way to stop gagging.

Here's what Chang's wrote back after I found hair in my take-out. I did respond to them last week but so far nothing back.  By Jove, I do think I've been blown off.  Oh well. Pei Wei is good too.  Casey,  Thank you for taking the time to contact us regarding your recent experience and I feel terrible about the situation.  Please trust that P.F. Chang's takes great pride in our food quality and kitchen sanitation. I am extremely embarrassed and please accept my personal apology. I have forwarded this to our Chef and I know that he will review this with the entire staff. Having said that, I would like to reassure you that this is not something we take lightly. We take the highest precautions in food preparations, and safety and sanitation is our number one priority.  It would be helpful if you could provide a few more details regarding your visit. Do you by any chance, still have the check number available? Did you call and speak with a Manager? Any additional information would be helpful in my efforts to address this further with our team. Please trust that we will take your comments back to our staff and use them as a coaching opportunity to improve where we have fallen short. I look forward to hearing from you.   Sincerely,   Caity Miller Guest Relations P.F. Chang's China Bistro    ­­

Ok - an update to my review from a year ago. I went back to the salon for a fill - I thought I would keep a careful eye on the tech, be sure not to get the same person, and be wary of how it was done - plus it is much harder to mess up a fill than a new full set of pink and white which does take some skill. The tech's name was Casey (!) and she did a lovely job. And much to my surprise when I left the owner (? Manager?) Tammy came over and asked to speak with me. She apologized for my bad experience and said I should have asked to speak with her. I was very impressed that she remembered my posting here from more than a YEAR ago (!!!) and she also gave me a certificate for a free full set, which offset the cost of that bad experience from before. I will still be careful to watch the techs here because I do not know enough of them well enough to make a blanket judgement about the overall skill set, but it's encouraging to know that management's heart is in the right place and that there was some concern and a real effort to make up for a bad experience. I am leaving my past post up for a bit so people who may have read it recently can see there has been a change of heart, but I will eventually delete it and give this business a chance for a fresh start - I will certainly report to Tammy if I am unhappy in future, as it's apparent she cares about her clients! And I want to say again that Casey did a lovely job - my nails looked super and I was very pleased, she was fast, courteous, and checked in with me from time to time to be sure I was happy. Kudos for Casey! I also want to mention that if you wish to tip your tech be sure to bring cash, as they do not allow tipping via credit card. I embarrassed myself by not having enough for a good tip.

I've read a number of reviews here and wanted to address some of the nastier ones. I spent a LOT of time at DD. A LOT. This is such a fun place. Note I said "FUN", not "spotlessly clean" or "perfect". They do get crazy busy sometimes, and it seems to go in waves - 20 people will show up at once all wanting their pots! But if you've never worked on the wheel or done slab work before and live in the north/west valley, you really ought to try this place out. You will have a blast! Mishy Katz, the owner, knows more about clay than most people will ever learn. They do high fire, mid-range, and raku fires; teach wheel and hand-building classes and offer open studio for studio members. There are a bunch of wheels and tables and soooo many glazes. But you have to realize, this is a busy, WORKING studio, run by a private owner, not a school or a conglomerate. If you come at a super busy time you will likely have to wait a minute to get your pots. If you show up late to a class is it really fair to make everyone else wait while you get caught up? Then you are taking time away from their instruction, which they also paid for. I spent many many hours and days here when I first came to this part of town and was working a full time corporate job; these days I have my own home studio and sell professionally. Mishy was a huge help then and there are still times I will confab with her, or run over when I need an emergency bag or two of clay and the supplier is closed. You won't find a nicer bunch of people anywhere!

I have known Serina for years and have watched her transition from "the big girl" (ask her and she'll tell you all about it!) to "the Zumba Instructor and gym/club owner" with pleasure and pride. Her contagious, boundless enthusiasm, knowledge of dance, natural rhythm, and - now that she's running her own club - ability to identify and bring aboard others with her same drive and love of helping others achieve their fitness goals while having fun, is inspirational. Check out the club; try a Zumba class, try a Hump a Donk class (Ryan's a great instructor for this!), try a Real Ryder class - but don't put it off if you live ANYwhere near In the RA Fitness! There's nothing in town quite like it!

Thanksgiving dinner to go! - Having just returned from our honeymoon, and out of sheer exhaustion, I ordered our entire Thanksgiving dinner from Bella Notte - turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy, bread with herbed butter (fabulous!), autumn vegetables, yams with marshmallows, and pumpkin pie - the entire cost was LESS than what I would have spent at the market, and all we had to do was reheat... the slow heating filled the house with beautiful aromas, the bird was brown and juicy, the potatoes fluffy, gravy rich, all in all a marvelous meal. On Saturday after Thanksgiving we had a 2nd dinner at a friends - but this one was better ... I have spent $300 - 400 setting up a holiday dinner for 8 in the past, and we spend UNDER $200, with extras, and had leftovers after feeding 8 people! And I was so much less stressed! Thank you Chef!

NOT CLOSED THANK GOODNESS THAT IS A YELP ERROR! Still in biz at a faaabulous new location bigger and better than before - still the BEST Zumba classes in town - if you haven't had a Zumba class from Serina or Ryan, you haven;t had a Zumba class! And check out the Real Ryder classes if you like to spin - a whole new slant (pun intended - the bikes actually move from side to side giving you a whole body and core workout all at once.) And now they have room for retail so you can get your wardrobe workout in too! Love this place and cannot say enough great things about it!

We had a large party sitting outside - maybe that was the issue. But the fish was cold, the salad was warm, the minestrone soup was not only cold but mushy and burnt (like it gets when you scrape it up from the bottom of the pot after it's been sitting too long). Three of our party didn't get their food until everyone else was not only completely finished not only with their entrees but also their 2nd cocktails or coffees. Some things were comped but overall mediocre, overpriced (salmon salad, soup and 3 glasses of wine were almost $70 before tip). The wine was passable but nothing special. Nice ambiance but disappointing. Skip it or maybe try it for lunch when they are not busy. And give yourself plenty of time to find a place to park. The place was - unaccountably, based on our experience - busy. Just another trendy Scottsdale watering hole.

This place USED to be good. We waited over an hour for a table. Bathrooms were dirty and crowded. Servers were rushed and inattentive. Our pizza was cold and soggy, the salad was lukewarm and the "crispy" onions on the Beefstro salad were charred inedibly black. We asked for extra meat, didn't get it, but were charged for it. We were charged extra for the inedible onions. We asked to have them replaced and got a half measure of soggy ones instead. We asked for dressing on the side, didn't get that, asked for extra beef on the side, didn't get that either. The server was in a blind panic rush all night - and they were busy but no more than usual. LAST time we were here they also screwed up our order - the manager came over to apologize and said he would take it off our tab. The server charged us anyway. *sigh* We paid - we'd been there long enough. All in all makes me wonder - why did I think this place was good? Oh yeah - it used to be. Now they are complacent and riding the rep. Try elsewhere or go when it is empty (if you can find a time) and you might get better than half-assed decent service and food.

This is a fabulous shop - I've bought several bottles from them now, and can say that truly these oils are the real deal, not over-processed, over-pressed, too-young oils; these are rich, and full-flavored, whether deliciously accented with butter, shallot, garlic etc. or pure EVO. The balsamics are every bit as good and while the flavors certainly can stand alone they combine in so many delicious ways! Rich and Martha will let you taste anything and have great suggestions on combos and cooking. Healthy, light, delicious, EASY way to add fabulous flavors to so many dishes. If you have never used a flavored balsamic or EVO I promise it will change the way you cook! Check out the honeys, candles, and ceramics while you are there too - great gift ideas! (Try the avocado lemon oil with white fish with just a light drizzle of balsamic over the top just before serving - so quick and easy, no more boring week night dinners, and you look like a pro!)
