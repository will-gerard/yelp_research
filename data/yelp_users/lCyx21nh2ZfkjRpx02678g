Fantastic selection of sodas! I highly recommend the red velvet cupcake flavor as an ice cream float! The food is mediocre, but the family that owns the shop are very nice and offer great service.

Inspired food. Insipid service. Should our first clue have been the waitress' vapid gaze or the mindless dribble of incoherent gastronomic buzzwords which burst forth like a teenager's acne? Perhaps the disengaged and mechanical affirmations to our queries and comments should have fostered more concern? Alas, I spend such little time in the presence of tweakers, I missed the early warning signs of atrocious service.  Thankfully this lackluster performance was repeated with such regularity at every interaction we came to quickly relish, in the way of a beaten animal, the trials and tribulations our brunch entailed. Our waitress' feat was only topped by the complete disinterest of her supervisor in resolving a minor billing concern. The supervisor did a brilliant job of failing to resolve our concern in any way and avoiding providing clear information to understand the concern. Such rousing leadership at Snooze's head affords the clear inspiration behind our waitress' sterling work ethic.  Our atrocious service was unfortunate for Snooze offers some truly impeccable dishes from unassuming well-seasoned hash-browns to the dare I say foodgasmic OMG French toast. Nevertheless, until such time our robot overlords automate away the humble waitress profession I must recommend forgoing Snooze's culinary delights in favor of any other establishment which values event a modicum of customer service.
