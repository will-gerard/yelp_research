I work around the corner from this place, and having driven past on my way to work for a few months, I finally got the chance to give Copper Star a try, and I've been back 3 times in one week.  The design and overall feel of the interior is wonderful.  Especially now that the weather is getting cooler, I loved sitting inside next to the large open door, enjoying a lovely day.  I was there for a few hours working on my laptop, and I enjoyed that the people around me were a break from the normal "coffee shop crowd." Speaking of the coffee shop crowd, the employees here are nicer than any barista, anywhere.  Seriously.  They greet everyone with a smile, and take your beverage order without judgement (how refreshing!) while willing to give recommendations if you need a little guidance.  But the thing that really pushed it over the top for me is the baked goods.  OH.  MY. GOSH.  This morning I stopped in to get a muffin on my way to work and half an hour later, when I finally got a chance to eat it (still warm!!), I literally walked around telling half my coworkers about this muffin.  It was that good.  Thank you copper star, for becoming my new regular coffee shop.

I've been a regular customer of Boulders on Broadway for 4+ years.  Over that time, my friends and I developed relationships with the wonderful servers there, who always remembered our names, our favorite dishes, and who were always willing to recommend a great new beer from the extensive, ever changing list.  In the past year or so, however, this place has gone downhill fast.  The online beer list never matches the beers on the chalkboard, so it's hard to order without checking with your server about what's ACTUALLY going to be on tap.  They also no longer have prices posted, so more than once I have been surprised by ordering a "premium" beer when no indication of this was given on the menu.  Unfortunately, in our past 3 visits, we've sat for 15-20 minutes before actually being visited by a server.  On one occasion this summer, I found a fly in my salad.  Their employee turnover has also been unreasonably high as of late...gone are those friendly servers who remembered our names and made us feel welcome.  In the past year, we've had a different server on every visit, and every time they seemed brand new (didn't know the beer list, forgetting our order, etc.).  The final straw was that in our last two visits, the servers have been not only incompetent but downright rude, even insulting people at our table to our faces.  Sorry Boulders...based on our history, I've given you too many chances.  No more.

I started with one of their signature cocktails, the Skirt Chaser, which combines two of my favorite things: St. Germain and Hendrick's.  Don't be afraid of the Tabasco, I didn't really taste it.  I could have kept ordering them all night! We started with the crab cake, which was amazing.  Most crab cakes are mostly bread crumbs but this was just sweet, tasty crab, plain and simple.  I could have gobbled the whole thing.  The sauce they serve with it had a little kick, and was amazing. My entree was the veal meatloaf, which was probably the most tender yet satisfying thing I have ever eating.  It was somehow light and airy and stick-to-your-ribs at the same time, and came perched atop a pile of house made mashed potatoes. For dessert, I deferred to the mother-in-law and let her order the coconut cream pie.  I would have preferred something chocolate since I don't usually like coconut, but in this case we definitely made the right choice.  The coconut cream pie came covered in a cloud of freshly whipped cream and covered in white chocolate slivers.  I can honestly say that is was the most delicious dessert I have ever tasted.  I woke up the next morning craving another piece! Overall, Del Frisco's provided an amazing gastronomic experience and I will definitely be back!
