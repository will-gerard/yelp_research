It's ok- last year we had Golfland Sunsplash season passes and were planning to go there again this year but when they had a one day only 12 hour super sale on season passes and I just so happened to be working a 12 hour shift that day-they peeved me into buying Big Surf season passes.  Now-Big Surf, is a bit nicer and more relaxed than Sunsplash, but it could definately use some cleaning and care. The staff are mostly high school age and have no customer service or training-so next year Big Surf could save money on staffing and just hire monkeys or hyenas because either would do the job better than what's working there now.  If you go with really low expectations, you are going to have a great time.  The food is mediocre and pricey. The parking is free and ample. The large wave pool is nice and full of pee. How do I know? I never see anyone in the bathrooms.  The slides are average.  Again, go with low expectations and all is going to be fine.

Star Flores has been cutting my hair and my son's for the past 2 years. It is refreshing to have come across her and this salon after spending years and a small fortune at a high end 'spalon'. What I like best is the affordable price, frequent specials and coupons offered, plus the location is centrally located next to shopping, dining and entertainment.  Star Flores listens when I describe the look that I want achieved and has never forced her 'stylist opinion' on me. She is great with my son and he looks forward to seeing her and getting his hair cut. I fully expect to continue a great haircutting and styling relationship with Star at Arizona Hair Co! Remember to log onto their website and click on specials/coupons to save some money! You don't need an appointment, but I recommend one-remember to ask for Star!

Prom perfect at the last minute! Phew!  Star the manager took my niece as a client to save her prom from being ruined!   My niece did a "home box job" of color on her hair and turned it a grey shade of orange. Star took her at the last minute and fixed the color beautifully! Then styled her hair into a prom perfect look.  Snaps! Kudos! Thank you Star for your time, talent, professionalism and willingness to go the extra mile for a client!  If you need a great stylist for cuts or colors, visit Arizona Hair Co in the Tempe Marketplace and ask for Star. You'll be glad you did!  *check the Arizonahairco.com website for coupons!

Today I used a gift certificate (Merry Christmas!) to drive a Lamborghini Gallardo for 5 laps at Exotics Racing. It was my first time at the business and my first time on a track in a luxury sportscar.  Overall, I had an excellent experience. The place was clean, orderly, staff were friendly, and the cars were clean also. In short, nothing was stinky or sticky.  I really appreciate the hair bonnet to wear under the helmet so I have a wee barrier of protection between my hair and whoever else had that helmet on before me.  I had a very attentive, informative and instructive professional driver with me named Chris H. who took the time to answer my multitude of questions.  I learned a few tips and tricks in the safety briefing and enjoyed the discovery lap in the Porsche wagon.  As for kids: I would pay for my 8 year old to have the hot laps with the professional drifter driver Bo.  I did not ask at the time, but was thinking on the way home, if any of the cars have a back seat, it would be worth it to pay to have my son ride along on my laps.  I would definitely visit this business again and can recommend it to anyone else who is looking for a race car driving experience.

This is a studio in the Urban Art chain of tattoo and piercing and it's brand new, clean, well stocked with flash and amazing talent. I recommend Sage, the owner for professional and clean lined portrait tattoos that bear a striking resemblance to the photos you provide. I think you will enjoy the precision piercings, award winning tattoos and payment options available at Urban Art II. Remember to get a gift card!

Brown Bear BBQ-is so good! I first encountered the dry rub BBQ at the Scottsdale Barrett Jackson car auction. It was so good that I had to make the trip to try it again!   The Brown Bear BBQ joint is inside the Chevron gas station at the corner of Ironwood and Baseline-or you just may see the big school bus yellow BBQ trailer somewhere at an event. If you see it stop to eat!  The portion was very generous-I had the rib tips as well as the ribs with a wee side of brisket and pulled pork on a telero roll. I also ordered small sides of potato salad and coleslaw. The price is low for the large portion.  The BBQ is cooked slow and low-it has 3 levels of  flavor from the beginning bite on the bark ( that dry rub spice crust) to the smoke ring just below the bark and finally into the tender fall off the bone meat.  There were a variety of sauces to  try-I tried them all and find that the Ironwood Special is the best in my opinion-spicy hot!  Its very clean inside, there are a few tables to eat at, and Brown Bear BBQ serves breakfast, lunch and dinner starting at 4 a.m.!  If you ride a Harley-this is a great trip east of Mesa to have a good meal.   p.s. if you like hot-I mean really hot, hot sauce-make sure and have some of the Extreme Hot African Ghost Pepper BBQ sauce-and have a telero roll on hand to help soak up the heat!

Today I got a hair cut and style with Andrea Paxman at the Sassy Chic Salon in Mesa Arizona. The salon is comfortable, clean, has a funky vibe to it-and there is free water, diet Dr Pepper, and other beverages available while you wait. Which won't be long! Andrea Paxman was on time, polite, listened, gave a great scalp massage during my shampoo and then listened and performed the cut I asked for. The blowout style is included in the price-wait for it...wait for it...no coupon...and the wash/cut/style was $20.00. She includes a two week guarantee on the service so if for some reason you are not thrilled with it-you can come back free of charge for a fixing.  Andrea also designs and sells a variety of clip in hair flowers that vary from  retro chic to little girl girly.  If you need a fresh, fun and hip hair cut-give Andrea Paxman at Sassy Chic Salon a try.
