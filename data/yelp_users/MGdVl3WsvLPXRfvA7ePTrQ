Yuck.  The "steamed vegetables" were from a frozen medley. The taste of the food was off.  My son's shake wasn't blended all the way. The bathroom smells and the jukebox numbers don't play the right songs that you pick.  There were rips in the booth upholstery.  I will never come back here again.

So disappointed... if you need a quick wash then this may be your place but not for a detail.  I came in Sunday to get a car wash so I could take pictures of my car and get it online to sell that day.  I was upsold the detail , which I didn't mind (this time) since it needed it and might help the sale.  I was told it would take 2 hours and since I had no one to pick me up he would expedite it.  I walked to a nearby shopping area and waited the two hours.  I returned to be told that not only did they not do the car but there was still someone ahead of me and asked if I could come back tomorrow morning... .  I left very upset and called the next day to talk to the manager.  He explained that he should never have promised me a time and I told him I would return Tuesday morning.  When I arrived I was told that they were no longer taking pre-paid details that day...  So I had to ask for the manager, who never came out, but then they told me they would take it.  I left it all day and returned the next morning.  I was expecting perfection (to make-up for the, let's call it 'scheduling blunders') but did not receive it.  I came home and had to finish out the detail work.  I don't think they use a wet sponge as some things they missed cleaned up right away.  I also had to hose off the floor mats that were disgusting and crunchy.  No offer of compensation from Danny's.  I won't make that mistake again.

Victor is excellent.  Not only is he very skilled in cut and color, his prices are reasonable.  I have received compliments on my cut and have many friends who now go to him and are very happy.  You won't be disappointed.  The staff is friendly and courteous as well.

I bought the groupon for this service and what a deal!  So easy and convenient - they come to you.  I have very good quality knives but haven't had time to sharpen them myself lately- had my mom bring hers over, too and so we got to take full advantage of having 10 sharpened.

I have never been to a chiropractor before but after meeting Darla I decided to try it.  I also brought my 14 year old son to see if it could help with his allergies.  It has been very educational and insightful.  The staff and Dr. Cathcart are friendly and knowledgeable.

Came here for a kid's birthday party and the service was horrible.  None of the employees seem to know much, even the girl at the ticket register couldn't answer my questions - and none of them said, "I don't know, let me ask my supervisor."  The bathrooms were disgusting - trash on the floor and extremely dirty and sticky floors.  The games are great but expect to pay a lot for credits.  Food is not bad but pricey for what it is,

Very disappointed.  Loved this place when they opened but this time I was disappointed.   Tea had a bad flavor, tables were dirty, son said meatballs tasted funny and no sauce and my turkey coleslaw was bland.   Bread didn't seem like anything special.  Too expensive for below average food.

Excellent chips and salsa - worth coming here just for that.  I think there are better tacos in town but I look forward to trying other items on the menu.

The staff is friendly and the subs are so good.  They have the Hawaiian pork sandwich back and it is amazing.  I also love the theme - very well done.

If you are looking for Mexican or southwest style tile this is the place to go. They have a product range for all budgets.   They have samples throughout the house that give great ideas for application.  Not all products are available to view but thier website is more comprehensive.

I bought a living social deal to have Easy Air and Heat inspect my AC/heat pump because it didn't seem to be cooling well this summer.  Dennis came out and told me what the problem was and quoted me both the repair and the price of a new unit.  I also happened to be going to the Home and Garden show the same day and got a couple other bids that were significantly higher.

This is our new favorite place for pizza. The prices are great, pizza is good and the staff and owner are super friendly. We are glad is here in the neighborhood.  It is my go to place when I don't want to cook.  Use your coupons and get a punch card.

I thought this was going to be a great new addition to the neighborhood. I was incredibly disappointed. My friend had the wings and I had the short ribs.   Both disappointed.  Mine was full of gristle and bone and she was very disappointed with hers. And sitting at the bar looking through a sneeze guard was not my idea of ambiance. My friends went the night before and said their drinks were strong and the night we were there they were very weak. So I guess I need to give the place another try since so many people are giving it high ratings but I think they need to really up their  game if they want to compete the better restaurants in this area.
