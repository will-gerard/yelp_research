Brent was referred to me by a pool guy who uses him for all repairs. I called him on a Saturday and he arrived at my house 40 minutes later to fix my broken backwash valve (The stem snapped off). He was professional and very fair with his pricing.  I am a DIY guy myself but know when to call a professional when it is necessary. I will use him again when I need the help.

Very poor customer experience, they need training in customer service. Too many other good car washes near by to waste time with them again.

Disappointed. Went for brunch and at 10:32 while in line counter guy said no more breakfast. "Breakfast ends at 10:30". We left and so did two other groups in line. Not a great customer service philosophy.

Hands down the best bank in AZ.  Three reasons why I chose MidFirst: 1. I can use any ATM anywhere and MidFirst reimburses the fees 2. Open 7 days a week, Extended hours M-F 7AM- 7PM 3. GREAT customer service and a stunning banking center.
