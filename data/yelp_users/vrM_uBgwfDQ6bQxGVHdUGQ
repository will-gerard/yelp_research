Hey All!   If you are looking for Chihully at the Desery Botanical Gardens, you've missed it! But, you won't miss the intimate atmosphere that is provided by the garden and the creatures  living in the garden. We wandered over to Desert Botanical Gardens in search of the Chihully exihibit and found a quiet peaceful garden. I have to admit because it was nearly 100 degrees outside the garden was a little more vacant but this actually proved to benefit our experience. We noticed several creatures walking around the garden and foraging for food. At one point, one of the large squirrels was walking around right in front of us, practically posing on a tree branch! We took several pictures of our squirrel friend. We also noticed several lizards wandering around just a few feet away from us! Overall the experience of the garden was fantastic and very relaxing. Stop by on a cooler afternoon, or early evening for a wildlife experience you surely won't forget.

This restaurant is by far, one of the best little tucked away Chinese establishments I have ever been too. The decor is adorable, the wait staff is very sweet and just right with attention/grace. My companion seems to really enjoy the Sizzling Rice soup, although I am more in love with the Hot and Sour Soup. We are now making Desert Jade our meeting spot. Whether you enjoy having an entree, for example the Walnut Shrimp or the Beef and Broccoli; or you are looking for an entire meal of appetizers, this is your place. The selections are endless and the flavors are incredible. It makes one feel comfortable to venture off the path and chose something new. I guarantee this establishment is worth the drive, wait, and traffic. My personal menu favorites are the Walnut Shrimp, Pot Stickers, Fried Wontons, Hot and Sour Soup, and the Sizzling Rice Soup.  But I don't want to waste anymore of your time, get out of the house and head to Desert Jade!

Outback is always a great place to be! Enjoy the atmosphere and the fantastic steaks while sipping your favorite cocktail. The wait staff is very polite and helpful. I haven't much to say on the bad side of this place. We walked in, were seated and we were able to cuddle quietly in our booth for nearly an hour and a half.  Over all a great experience!

For the first time ever, I have decided to aware 5 stars. I guess its the euphoria of enjoying Pita Jungle, then again maybe its the opportunity to go to three different Pita Jungle's and still get the same great service.  I have noticed this location to be wrought with the 20 somethingers and 30 somethingers. I enjoy the chance to kick back, be healthy and have a good time.  Thanks, Pita Jungle!

High Speed Internet.  Famous last words, lol. I kid, I really do! This place is much more than the internet......... It has great coffee, great service and great conversation! I can spend hours flanking the bar surfing the internet or doing my homework. If I feel social friends are surely to join as well.       Rush is set off of a small man made lake which is very nice especially with the weather changing to the "fall" temps of Arizona. Seemingly cool breeze and the slight buzz of a coffee house are two qualities that make for a wonderful mix in this coffee house.       There is a barista behind the counter whom I am not sure of his name, but he is very meticulous about his espresso shots. I can testify that I have seen him spend ten minutes working on shots to get the most perfect shots. (This is a great quality I know of since I worked in a stuffy and particular coffee house for years.) Check out him and Coffee Rush for their shots, drinks, vibes and lastly, the internet :)

Remember the Presidents of the United States? Millions of peaches, peaches for me, millions of peaches, peaches for free. Well not exactly free, but you get the point.  Schnepf Farms annual peach festival is drawing to a close because the crop has been picked but I have one thing to tell you, mark your calender for next year. Around the second weekend in May. Annual Peach Festival in Queen Creek. They have hay rides, peach pancake breakfast, a peach bakery with all kinds of peachy goodness and peach jams, jellies and salsas. I actually purchased the raspberry and apricot jams in addition to 2 very large flats of peaches. We were so excited when we got home! We had tons of peaches! The whole experience was worth the heat, sweat and dust of dirt, not to mention the drive. Take a drive through main Queen Creek and your whole experience will be fun and worth it!

My friend Brad is always talking about this place.......so that says someting, either Brad needs psychological help or this place is really cool.  Bean is great for the coffee, atmosphere and the high speed internet kicks into gear.  Check this place out for all the greats and glorys.. Also Friday nites are open mikes with impromptu players.    I just wanted to add a couple hints about the Bean for the new xtreme beaner....  *** Get their early, the internet access is free and its kicking like chuck norris. Your chances of getting a place indoors is pretty limited, so like i said get their early. In the day time, before 6. The place, power outlets and people fill up around 615. The outer patio area is still nice as well, you can find a nice spot to cozy up with a book.

I am somewhat ecclectic in regards to my tastes. I like having a story about everything. Now enters Bo Sa donuts, my boyfriend and I stumbled on Bo Sa one Sunday morning after a long night of drinking. We stopped for our usual Filiberto's breakfast burrito and suddenly noticed the Bo Sa Donut Shop haunting us from the next street over. We stopped in to check the place out and we were completely surprised. It was small, quaint and reeked of donut glory. It also had the perfect mix of family, joy and happiness. Not to mention some incredible donuts. As long as we live around Bo Sa we won't be shopping at any Safeway Bakery or Fry's Bakery.

I like my share of microbeers, but this place has the market cornered! Is it the Tempe water, I hope not. But, the food and brews are the best. Kiltlifter and heffie are two of my personal favs. Others have remarked how good the Peach Ale is as well as the IPA. For a great place to enjoy the microbrews, off the beaten path atmosphere and overall..cozy approach, stop in for a pitcher on me ;)  If I am there, I will surely buy!

What is SWIHA?  Southwest Institute of Healing Arts Massage School, Life Coaching School, Intuitive Studies, etc..  This place gets four stars because of my personal opinion, i love the intuitive nature and the peaceful environment. The welcoming peace that encapsulates your soul once you walk in the front door is amazing.  What I am concerned about is a certain Licensed Massage Therapist, Odette who conducted herself in a less than professional manner outside of the walls. Unfortunately she is associated with SWIHA as I met her there, therefore she is part of this review.  Inside the walls of SWIHA she was helpful and very talented at what she does. Outside the walls she made choices regarding an appointment we had scheduled and I was put aside despite my already having made the commitment to the appointment. Needless to say, I will never be receiving her services, inside or outside of SWIHA.   One of the best Licensed Practioners at SWIHA Massage School is Ann.  She is very skilled and does everything from deep tissue work, Reiki, Swedish Massage to a gentle Lymphatic Massage. Worth the money and definitely worth the time!!

Jump on the Pita Jungle bandwagon!!! The food is definitely worth it!! There really isn't much else to say, but the food is great! Oh and the atmosphere is awesome, servers are great and if you are feeling up to it you can eat outside.  Hummus is great and the pitas are well put together.  BTW - Two people can have beverages, appetizers and meals for about 20$....not that I am cheap, but I am a college student. Nice deal in my book!

Tasty Kabob is a must see on any Hookah bar tour. They serve food, coffee and alcoholic beverages for those of age. In addition, the Hookahs are top notch. Now on to the food! Ever had Saffron Rice or Chargrilled Steak, Chicken or Pork? Try any of the Kabob platters, very good!  Also they have the best Persian Ice Cream which is only one flavor....what is the flavor??....(its a secret, you will have to go there and find out!) Prices are moderate for a dinner for two, atmosphere is casual enough to be a great first date place (attention cheesy guys) and they are rarely busy so cosy dates can become sweet and innocent.  For persian cuisine in the East Valley this place is a must.

Romantic, outdoor eatery, complete with the christmas lights and all the ambiance associated with high dollar ticket entrees found on Sunset Blvd..  This one gets 1 star bcause of the food having some decent flavor. The other four stars were dropped because of the gigantic cockroach that was hiding beneath my plate.   What!!??? I know you are wondering what happened, well here is the story. Eating dinner nice and peacefully, nearly finishing up and the waiter comes over to snag my plate to wrap up my leftovers. As he picks up the plate the GIGANTIC cockroach makes an appearance running across the table cloth towards my lap. I jump from the table and my seat, the waiter swept the cockroach onto the ground. ......okay now wait for the ultimate response from the waiter!!!  "That's what happens when you eat outside"  Nothing was offered in compensation for the "gigantic cockroaching."  Beware of the unprofessional service and the unlikely bedfellows!

This place deserves four stars for the eclectic and eccentric qualities. BUT!!! I take away one star because I always turn south down 3rd Avenue forgetting its a one way street. Now, my only defense is that I am mostly hung over when I go here, so I know not which way I drive but that I am going towards the great heavenly beacon known as the coffee house vibe. Is it me, or does everyone recover at a coffee house??       Willow has got what it takes to make the place stick in anyone's imagination. From Dia de los Muertos Sugar Skulls to strange nic nak oddities being sold, this place has consumer crap to wrap your hands around in addition to the coffee! Nightly, they have a projection screen and show indie films and again other eclectic big screen oddities .        Toss out your super large flat screen TV....well dont, and head down to Willow House for some cozy big screen movie watching complete with the aura and mystic of your favorite coffee beverage.

Recently I have upped my star count to 5 stars, but for the sake of this review I thought I could reserve one star for myself. I thought that hotel was nice and our experience was enjoyable but, I wasn't too pleased with the rooms themselves. Being a hotel connoisseur I pride myself on being knowledgeable about what is acceptable in a hotel and what is not acceptable. For example, nice beds rank very high for me. A nice bed is defined as a bed that is cushy, not a bed that feels like its been a hotel bed for 100 years. New York New York beds were a little rough on the back and for me, someone who likes a softer mattress left some kinks in my neck each morning. The room service was very nice and I was happy to notice the opportunity to order whatever we wanted from the menu. We were very lucky when it came down to the front desk because we asked for a better room from our first room and they obliged. Interestingly, we went through 2 rooms before we found one that was perfect. We finally found a room that offered a strip view, king size bed and a little living room area. My fiance was there for 2 days previous to me and he was enjoying a conference for his work. They closed down the Brooklyn Bridge for a welcoming afternoon of open bar and appetizers. They also chose to close down the streets of New York for another banquet during the conference. All in all, New York New York did an excellent job of ensuring that our needs were met, despite the lack of decent bedding and provided a provocative format that would stimulate return business.

First of all, I would like to say that I have had some really authentic Dim Sum and I have had some really interesting Dim Sum. Both previous experiences were in places located off the west coast, one in Vancouver, British Columbia and the other in San Diego. That being said, this place was sweet and lived up to the high standards set before. If you go, take your appetite and try as many of those little plates as you can. If you are real lucky, try to get someone to tell you what you are ordering so you can eat again. :)  It was fairly not busy for a Friday afternoon, but i have hear Saturdays and Sundays this places gets busy.  Let me know how you like it.

For everyone out there who loves Brazilian food, will not be ashamed by the experience of Fogo E Brasa. My fiance and I enjoyed valentine's evening at Fogo E Brasa, but, I have to say, this place requires a middle of the week event instead of a Friday, Saturday night outing. It appeared that even though we had a reservation, the hostess had over booked the restaurant and there were many people waiting to eat. Taking Valentine's Day out of the equation, I would say Fogo would be a nice evening for a middle of the week anniversary dinner, graduation dinner, family get together,  birthday dinner, girls night out, or if you just feel the need to consume mass quantities of meat. The good thing about Fogo was the opportunity to try different and new things. Fogo has a signature mojito that is worth the experience because it is crafted right there in their dining room bar. In addition, Fogo will extend to you the salad bar as a part of your meal. But, try if you can to avoid as much of the salad bar, because you may end up packing up your little stomach with salad instead of succulent meats, seafood and porks. In the end of our meal we were both satisfied in our experience and we have added Fogo to our list of Brazilian Restaurants.

Good morning coffee :)  I live about 2 blocks from Steve's and I find myself stopping by occasionally before work. As far as I know the owner opens the cafe around 6ish in the morning? I don't really know, seeing as how i need my coffee in order to communicate and I am usually running out the door on my way to work. Drinks are great, the place is clean and the tea selection is outrageous. I have never had a complaint about steve's and I don't think the future will bring dissatisfaction either.

This place is a must see on the casual bar tour of Scottsdale. Enjoy yourself at the bar or sitting in the high pit in the back. Atmosphere is a little shaky at first, don't get their too early or it will kill your beginning evening buzz. The bartenders knocked off a star. It seemed as though one bartender was really fantabulous while the otherone was a little off his game. But I digress. Give these guys a shot, because I know I will.  Drinks were great, best dirty martini I have had since I started the "Dirty" path. They also had Johnnie Walker Black which was a nice change from the usual Red Label.  TVs mounted on the wall can keep your boyfriend busy or some foreign guy you are trying to avoid. Smoking inside and there is a cute bar outside for those who crave the outdoors, :) Like I said before this place is great for your tour of Scottsdale bars   Catch yourself enjoying a good time at Drinx!  ***I  must amend my first review. Remember I said I would go back only because of the awesome bartender? Well, we wandered into Drinx for a Friday night of Girls Night Out. I had 6 total BEAUTIFUL, Drop Dead Gorgeous Girls with me. The wonderful bartender loved our group and was treating us very well with drinks and mixing up a storm. Apparently there was a miscommunication with the new bartender who relieved his shift, this miscommunication lead to one of my BEAUTIFUL girlfriends becoming upset and storming out of the bar.  What is my whole point in this? The not very cool or very businesslike general manager of the establishment made our group assume responsilbiity for the special treatment we were receiving. Excuse me?? She had no idea about good customer service or customer retention!! Good LUCK Drinx, I hope you can manage to keep business, because we aren't going back!!!!!

Great food and wonderful atmosphere. Try the WOK SEARED LAMB Lamb marinated with scallions and sesame. Served with cilantro over shredded lettuce. This was a surprise menu find.  The service was prompt and very courteous, especially when the waiter dropped a plate of our leftovers on the floor. What I mean is he had the cooks make up a fresh order for our to go bag. Good stuff. Anywho, the place is polished, the staff is courteous and this place beats with the heart of Downtown Tempe. Stop off and share a plate of noodles on your way out to the scene!

Zipps is a rocking place with TV screens in all viewable angles. The atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like Monday Night Football. Smoking is outside because this place is around the Tempe border. The service is great and the food is even better. Try the chicken tacos! Good times had by all! Check it out some time!

Please, please let me begin this review by saying I am not responsible for this reaction and it was entirely motivated by the awful experience my boyfriend and I endured. That being said I shall begin: La Vigne must have some seriously lofty goals because the ideas were both grande as well as maybe too lofty to obtain. We arrived at around 7:30 p.m. to a nearly bare restaurant on a Friday night. Now, particularly one of the reasons I enjoy dining out is for the atmosphere. I enjoy places that are packed with people, entertainment, servers and jubilation that is certain to change my mood. La Vigne was anything but those hot buttons. There were few dining parties, fewer servers and an empty piano bench sitting next to a baby grand piano. We were  however, greeted by the hostess and shown to our table. She offered a strong wine list as well as two heavily bound menus. The menu was a bit complicated.  Some of the entrees included Seafood, Duck and Poultry, (the standard fair of a french restaurant. Here is where La Vigne earned the two stars, one for the waiter and one for the delectable dinner bread served with an herbed butter as well as tabled olives.  At this point I implore caution, please only read further if you are interested in my opinion. If not, drop a few twenty dollar bills into a whole in the ground and bury them because that would be much better than suffering through this food.  After a few moments we chose some entrees and began the terrible downturn of our experience. I selected an entree that in French was Fruits de Mer....(Seafood), this included scallops, shrimp, mussels, egg noodle pasta and a bit of sprinkled parsley. My boyfriend chose a chicken and pasta entree. The price for each of these entrees ranged from $18.95 to $26.95 for the seafood. From here we settled in and enjoyed some quiet chatting. There was an appetizing course of French Onion soup for myself as well as a Caesar salad for my companion prior to the main course. Soon the entrees had arrived and we were shocked to see what actually came to the table. Our plates were huge and full of food, some what appearing to over compensate for something by showering us with extremely large portions.  Taste: I separate this one out, because of my own fondness of food I have a very specific palette that can taste everything in a good meal. In this case I was showered with a terrible entree. The shrimp was over cooked, tough and very chewy, the scallops where well done on the exterior and nearly raw on the interior, whereas the mussels didn't even have a supporting role. What was even more astonishing was the flavor the entire plate of egg noodles. Yes, I said Egg Noodles....just like the ones Mom used to prepare in her Hamburger Helpers. I half expected the pasta to be homemade with the prices they were charging. Secondly, the "pasta" was topped with shredded Parmesan cheese. But not the freshly grated fare, no, it was the store bought in a plastic tupperwear, pre-shredded months ago and sitting on the store shelf Parmesan cheese. As I attempted to eat my meal I was reminded that the chef maybe hasn't tried this dish himself because he would be appalled with how bad it tasted. The final nail in this coffin was the olive oil that was drenched over the pasta and seafood. The olive oil was very bitter and had not been infused with anything to save the day.   To bring an end to recounting this torture I understand that from time to time restaurants experience growing pains. I also understand these restaurants may change in the future, that being said I will re-review this establishment in 6 months time whereas at that time, I trust they will have figured themselves out.

Hey Guys:   I have to send an update to those who are loyal to my argumentative period of reviews.  La Vigne was unfortunately closed a few months ago. But, in all honesty I have to say with the lack of business over the past few months, I am not surprised. Our brief encounter with La Vigne expressed a desire to "as I would say" bury $100 in the ground and save myself the trouble of digesting the experience.  Anywho, just wanted you all to know I stand by my word and conviction!

Hey Guys,  This place is awesome....but I could be jaded because of all the wonderful wines I sampled! From the gris, cabs, sparkling shiraz, riesling to the chardonnay, this shop had what we were looking for and what we weren't looking for! The atmosphere was amazing and quiet for a Thursday night get together. Our hostess was sweet and doted to our every need. The food was amazing. I completely recommend the crocodile pot stickers.  For exotic wines and exotic meats appetizers, look up Down Under Wines!

I have to admit, Rio Sabor gained my interest. We went to Rio Sabor on Valentine's Day for a late dinner. The food was awesome and the grilled pineapple stood out amongst the grilled fair. We had a great time sampling from the different BBQ options and every cut of meat was tender and juicy.   The servers were courteous and professional. I absolutely recommend checking out the Brazilian Flare!

Hey Everybody!! Last night I had the awesome opportunity to sample the great portions and wonderful food of the Grand Lux Cafe. Owned by the same company as Cheesecake Factory, one can expect great service, attention to detail and fantastic food. We sampled the Mashed Potato Spring Rolls, Pasta Pomodoro as well as the Freshly Bakes Chocolate Chip Cookies for dessert. All of the entrees were excellent as well as the atmosphere was quiet and quaint. We were able to chat for a great while after out meal, while enjoying continued service.  This is the first location to open in Arizona. It is primely located in the Scottsdale Fashion Square with the accompaniments Kona Grill, Starbucks and Sephora. Cruise out, check it out and tell them I sent ya!

I loved Javino's!  On a scale of 5 stars I had to delegate 4 stars to the wonderful wine bar! The atmosphere was amazing and quaint! The beverages were fantastic and the in house band played some great chill out music.  Javino's is one of those places that you won't be disappointed at all!  Stop by and enjoy a happy hour or an afternoon snack!

Doctor Ragaini delivered my son in June 2011 and I have to say, she is the main reason I'm staying with New Horizons -Ahwatukee Location. The office staff appear new, lax, rushed, too busy, sometimes confused and I'm glad I'm not the only one.
