This place is awful!  Bought an Amazon Local deal for a massage.  Called to schedule it twice,  they said they would call back and never did.  I usually don't write negative reviews but I felt compelled to for this place.  I will pretend that this place no longer exists.   Don't waste your time!

The only regret I have about this spot is that I didn't know about it sooner.  Had the bean and cheese burrito and chicken tacos and both were amazing.  Looking forward to trying some other items.

This is my go to Thai place!  Pad Thai is excellent!  Drunken fried rice is awesome!  Yellow curry and panang curry are amazing!  Get there early for lunch if you want to avoid the rush.

Had the ribeye on 4th of July.  Not at all worth the money.  Go to Ruth Chris, Mastro's, Donovan's, Flemings or even Outback.  You will be better off.

I hesitate to even write a glowing review about this place because I am scared that the word will get out.   Scared that I will never be able to go back because it will be so packed.  At any rate, these folks are tied to the Someburros franchise in some way.  I can taste it in the chips and salsa which are delicious!  My wife and I went for opening day of restaurant week and got 2 apps, 2 main dishes, 2 margaritas and a dessert for $44.  I had the carne asada...it was unstoppable.  The serve it with beans and rice and a flour tortilla that is homemade without a doubt.  The flavor in the carne asada was amazing.  Was like nothing I've ever had before.  Real good flavor.  The street corn was bomb.  Highly recommend!  And the jicama and watermelon salad was also really good and refreshing. Arhat it's were very good also.  Check this place out!!!  It's definitely worth it!

Don't let the outside or the inside fool you.  This place is small but the food is great!  The staff was very attentive and welcoming!  The portions are very large.  Good for sharing.  Great for takeout if the place is too busy!  This rates up there with some of the best Thai I've had in Arizona!  Do it!  You won't be sorry!

This place is legit!  I've only had a few massages in my life but this one was pretty epic.  I went in for a 30 minute chair massage and came out feeling like a brand new man.  It's strange that the sign outside says "Foot Massage" but don't let that fool you.  The chair massage is not a chair massage.  You get to layout and relax.  30 minutes...$30 bucks?  No problem!  Marc was the guy who took care of me.  Tipped $20 he did such a good job.  Highly recommend!

I hate to write a glowing review of this place for the simple fact that I am selfish and don't want to wait every time I come back for a haircut. But...this place is legit!  Tony is super friendly, quick, and great at his craft.  Support your local barber!!!

I wanted to like this place because it is literally a stones throw from my house but...I just can't do it.   The decor is great.  The bar looks cool.  Service is very good and friendly.   Even the apps are good.  But the main dishes are overpriced, small quantity and lacking flavor.  I didn't get the Pho...maybe that was my problem.   The menu is weak. Outside of the apps.  They have pho, vermicelli and rice dishes.  That's it.  Very very disappointed!  Chandler Pho is 100 times better.  I won't be back until they fix it.

Went opening night.  Called in a taco pizza...said it would be an hour.  Got there and they said it would be 2.5 hours longer. Get this...before they would check on the order they made me pay only to tell me that I would have to wait 2.5 more hours.  Needless to say I demanded my money back and walked out!  This place is a circus!!! Undeserving of anything near a 5 star rating! 0 stars!!!
