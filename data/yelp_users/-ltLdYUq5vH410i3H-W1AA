Great service from Marcus. Took his time to make the exhaust fit perfect. Would recommend anyone here!

Would give this place more stars, but I haven't tried my raspberry fritter yet. This review is for their drinks. Unfortunately, they use powdered flavoring a for their drinks. I was excited when she had said that they use "real fruit" in their fruit yogurt drinks. To my disappointment, even asking if she could add some extra blueberries, she poured in about 5-6 blueberries over about 2 ounces of a liquefied yogurt, added powdered flavoring a and ice and water, and there appeared my wonderful blueberry yogurt shake. No thanks.... Maybe I would come again for donuts.
