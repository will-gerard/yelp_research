Emergency fill today and Thank the Gods!  There was a short wait (for a Saturday morning this is no surprise), my tech ("Lisa") was industrious, courteous and did GREAT work (nice and smooth, even, not thick bulky chopshop work).  Drawbacks MIGHT be that the polish selection wasn't as varied as I'd like but then I usually bring my own polish with me.    And no shade to park in within reasonable walking distance (it's summer in phoenix, this matters)  But otherwise very nice experience.  Thank you Lisa and Elle Nails.  PS - bring cash for tipping, they wont do it on your card.  ***Edit***  Went back for a fill, got a different girl, and lo and behold got the SAME QUALITY OF WORK!!!  This is my go-to nail salon from now on.    Ladies, I hope you read these.  Please don't let me down.

A year later and they're still my go-to.  Had a nail emergency today and they fit me in a couple hours after I called.  My nails are gorgeous and I will stop cheating on them out of convenience after this.  I promise.  :)

This place is a well of calm and grace in the middle of this cesspit we call a city.  The instructors are knowledgeable and kind and welcoming.  I have yet to meet anyone on the staff who was anything other than completely authentic and sincere.  They have classes for, literally, everyone.  Total noob or seasoned veteran, you'll have a home here.  Go.  Now.

The physical establishment is clean, comfortable in temperature and presentable in appearance.  Access is simple enough.    Then there's the staff.  When I rented the unit (June 2012) I had a great experience with the young man who showed me around and filled out my contract with me.  The kid gave great "face", as it were.  And then.  In the initial work-up, I made it Very Effing Clear that email was my preferred contact method because I do  not answer calls from numbers I do not recognize, The End.  Kiddo says "hey, no problem, we'll totally email you if we need to get hold of you for anything."  Fast foward several months to the rate change I wasn't made aware of.   Then fast forward a couple more months to the NastyGram I got in via regular mail saying "We're gonna auction off all your shit if you don't pay us"... except the money was no longer in my account as it had been sent to them via automated bill-pay.  So I call them and attempted to address the issue.  Hahaha.  The person on the phone (Terry, female) seemed to have difficulty comprehending my words - I explained the situation from my POV and she not only disregarded what I said but interrupted me several times in order to do it.  I freely admit I lost my patience (and nearly my temper) with her.    The situation is mostly resolved now, but I promise I am moving out of there next month because you will get a lot of lip service but not a lot of follow-through from this organization... and the new place less than a mile from my house is $50 a month cheaper for more space and a U-haul to move it all with.  :)

Clean, super friendly, and consistent.   Both dogs came home in perfect condition - no surprise nicks.  I'll always pay for what I get, and in this case I get great service at competitive prices, frequently at the last minute.

Let me preface this review by saying I went there for years, off and on, before Today.  Du himself is a FINE nail tech and does excellent work.  However.  I attempted on my last visit to make an appointment for the fill I wanted today.  He said "no, you no need appointment, just come in."  I reiterated my desire for an appointment and a second time he refused to make an appointment for me, instead insisting that it'd be fine if I just came in.  So I (like an idiot) listened to him, and arrived today at 10am. He said "30 minute wait."  Grudgingly, I accepted this.  By the time 50 minutes had passed and 5 clients (who all had appointments, btw) were taken in past me I lost my patience and called him out.  "What you want me to do?" was his only reply.  Du, I want you to take ANY APPOINTMENT A CLIENT REQUESTS and NEVER turn down an appointment because that means LOST INCOME.... because sure as the sun shines in Phoenix, I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on.  PS - he says they open at 9am but on 5/28/13 at 9:15 AM when I pulled into the parking lot the lights were OFF and no one was there.  When I mentioned this he pshaw'd me and told me I was wrong.  My check-in at another salon half a mile down the road at 9:20 would suggest not.

Been here for 2.5 days with my MIL and everyone has been extraordinarily nice, the care has been exemplary, and I'm confused at the negative reviews I read prior to posting this.    I guess a working understanding of medical care offers perspective and reduces entitlement.  YMMV.

They sent her to a long term care facility from here because she was "better" and 3 days later the LTCF sent her to Banner t-bird with severe pneumonia.  How the hell do you miss that?   The staff was nice and all, but that level of ineptitude cancels out any "nice".

I'd give no stars if I could.  The hours on the business are listed as 9a-7p M-Sat.  I was there at 8:55 am and waited until 9:10.  Nobody showed up.    I took my business across the street to Phoenix Nails which was open, clean, friendly and did I mention OPEN?  **EDIT** so some dude, I'm assuming the owner, messaged me several months after the incident to accuse me of "leaving and going somewhere else"... um, yes, that's what happens when y'all can't bother to be at work on time.

I am confused about the previous reviews - unless something has changed drastically in the recent past, the previous reviewers are sushi noobs or have very little discretion or taste.  The place is clean, the service is prompt and kind, and that's where the positives end.  The food (what there was of it) tasted great... but a 3/4' diameter salmon roll?  Please.  Long story short - the prices are high for the tiny portions you get, and while the complimentary miso soup and half a chilled orange were nice touches, I'll be skipping this place in the future.  Try Akai-hana on I-17 and Northern if you want the real deal for less $.

Reasonable prices, tasty food, friendly service, and near my house.    Can't ask for more than that, really.    Lots of variety, both dining room seating and bar seating (where you can watch the guys make your sushi up close) and great lunch and happy hour specials.  Just go and see for yourself.

Where do I start?    I have little experience with selling gold or jewels, so I walked in blind based on the previous Yelp reviews... and I was not disappointed!    Quiet shop, the employees I saw were all actually working, I was greeted immediately and assisted very quickly.  James (heir to the Diamond Jim's dynasty, I presume) was thorough, kind, and more than tolerant of my questions.    I left the establishment less than 30 minutes later, check in hand and smile on face.  I doubt seriously I will go anywhere else in the Valley for my jewelry-selling needs in the future.  As with all of my other reviews, don't listen to me - go find out for yourself.  I don't think you'll regret it.

Eric is an absolute gem.  (see what I did there?)  I was in and out of his well-placed and well-appointed office in under 10 minutes, I received cash in the amount of 86% of the value of my goods (THIS WILL ALWAYS DEPEND ON NUMEROUS VARIABLES SO YOUR EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT) and there is literally nothing to complain about in my experience with SWJB.  A+++  will do business again.

After a failed attempt to visit the salon across the street, I walked into Phoenix and was immediately greeted, asked to choose a color and sit down at a station.  The gentleman who did my fill/repair was quiet and efficient - no useless chit-chat, no dawdling, no nonsense.  The salon was clean, comfortable, and not decorated in cheesy 80's nail supply company posters.    I approve and I'll be back.  6 minutes later, I discover that the acryllic on one nail was filed down so thin that it's cracked off.  OFF.  Then I look at the other nails and notice that they're ALL really thin and are probably going to crack as well.  Fabulous.  In attempting to build return business for themselves, they've driven off another potential long term REALLY GOOD TIPPING client.  Stupid.  UPDATE:  Reduced to one star - attempted to call the establishment to ask about their policy regarding fixing their mistakes and was hung up on.  Giving the benefit of the doubt, I called back to allow them an opportunity to correct THAT mistake as well, but it happened again.  I can't even with these people.

Edit 6/4/14  The problem groomer from my previous review has been rehired, with the excuse that she was having a reaction to her medications which is why she was behaving the way she was. This isn't an excuse, but I was willing to overlook that on the terms that she in particular would not touch my dogs. I follow that with a statement regarding the consequences of the problems reoccurring.    The owner does not have any interest in the good name of her business because the reaction to the fair warning was "Don't you threaten me/I don't know if I want to do this/ad nauseum"   When I asked if they're doing so well as to be able to turn away solid and regular business, I got talked over to the point of having to yell to be heard.  That got me threatened with police involvement and thrown out of the establishment.  Folks, shoddy business practices should be met with disdain, at best.  Vote with your dollars and go somewhere that will not treat you like this for having the audacity to voice your opinions or concerns.  It's your money, you should absolutely be heard when you are concerned about spending it.  *** There is a sign that says CASH OR CHECK ONLY right on the wall/counter in the shop.  Don't blame the establishment if you fail to read/comprehend before you arrive to pick up your dog**  **Revised review, dated 11/01/13 **  So after an issue with the establishment, I reviewed the place on Yelp and gave it 2 stars.   That review (among others) resulted in a staff change.  After a message from the owner offering me a free grooming as a gesture of good faith in order to win back my business, I gave Dogtown a second chance.

Oh, Julioberto's how I appreciate thee.  I live down the street.  I am white, lower middle-class, educated, a 15 year veteran of the food service industry and a bit of a food snob (read:  fast food frequently isn't entirely made of FOOD) so believe me when I say that this place is the real deal.  Yes, the humans who work here occasionally make mistakes.  They will also rectify their errors if they are made aware of them.  The food is consistently fresh and delicious.  I've been advised by people of the culture Julioberto's represents that it is a spot-on example of home cooking, Mexican style.  The drive-through makes it easy.  They have patio seating which only does anyone any good during the tolerable months (Oct - April)  Yes the building is old and shows signs of wear - they spend their efforts and money not on superficial things but on the food that goes out the window.  Don't listen to me, or any of the others - go try it for yourself  and make a decision THAT way... the only way that's really valid.  PS the pork adobada is divine.

Saturday night, 8pm, the place wasn't overly crowded (thereby unbearable) so we got in quickly, got seated quickly, got drinks quickly, and were left blessedly alone - the waitstaff didn't hover or check in every 10 minutes.  The background music was cool but not hip, the live musicians were also cool but not hip, very unpretentious and comfortable.    Drink prices are medium but the tap beer AND the bottles are nice and cold.  Try it.

Started at this location 3 months ago.    Clean, open, and spacious.  Peak hours are busy, off-peak hours aren't so much (so that's when I try to go)  Stuff breaks down because it's the nature of machinery to do so, but the day the hot tub was down it was less than 24 hours before it was fully functional again.  The staff is amicable and helpful thus far.    I've read the other reviews and am probably jinxing myself by saying that I haven't had any issues with theft or vandalism as reported by other members.  This doesn't mean that I wont be extra careful.  Thieves can only steal what you leave for them to steal. :)  Alex, Coach and crew are doing a great job with this facility.

** Updating because sometimes technology sucks **  Don't take my word for it, go try it for yourself.  The Chipotle of Mediterranean food indeed. So good.  Chicken/rice/tabouli/veggies/hummus/feta/olives/cucumbers MMMMM.  |  I'll be back.

Gorgeous little place, nice ambiance, friendly and personable staff, quick in and out at what should have been the lunch rush.  Prices are competitive, as are the portions.  Checked out the happy hour menu, wish it didn't end before I get out of work (6pm)  Try it.
