Had my first and last dining experience at Liberty Market.  I agree with another comment I read below, cafeteria-style service should include cafeteria-style prices.  The food was just ok and I did not appreciate paying lots of cash for what I had for lunch.  (A very small salad with thinly sliced deli turkey on top)  I also see lots of comments about their "awesome" bathroom.  Really?  Who cares about the bathroom?  Suggestion:  Go to Joe's BBQ directly across the street or if it's breakfast you are in downtown Gilbert for, go next door to The Farmhouse!  Hands Down!!! Blows Liberty Market away.

I never thought I'd see the day where I was reviewing a fast food chain.  But this place has a great breakfast with great service.  I just recently found out that the Egg McMuffin can be ordered as an Egg WHITE McMuffin.  And the hot cakes...for fast food quality, 4 stars!  And you can't beat the price.  I ordered and Egg white McMuffin, 3 hash browns, 1 biscuit, and 1 coffee for 11 bucks! Enjoy

It's a shame. Disappointed.  I wish they would stop changing the Happy Hour menu. In my opinion, they used to have the best HH menu in all of AZ.  They have now changed it yet again, doubled in prices, and the selections were unworthy.    Not sure why they always try to fix what is not broken.  Please bring back the Chicken Drumettes with the honey bourbon sauce, the Artisan Grilled Cheese with the brie and fig jam, and The Prime Rib Dip which was to die for.

BE ADVISED:  A group of 4 employees where I work and some vendors that took them to The Euro Cafe in dowtown Gilbert were diagnosed with food poisoning just last week.   A few have been treated at the hospital, while others are home fighting through it.   VERY SERIOUS - the proper authorities were notified and are collecting data of everyone affected for the department of health.

As an Italian girl, I am insulted that this place is categorized "Italian".    When I plan a pizza night out, I do not like spending $25 for frozen pizza.  When did it become OK to call frozen pizza Gourmet?  Next time I'll do DiGiorno.  We had a large Hawaiian pizza and tried the Gelato.  NYPD and Streets of NY have tastier, fresh pizza.  I have to agree with Colin M.  "And while they offer gelato, it's as disappointing as the pizza."  For an authentic, Italian gelato, don't mess around; go to Frost at the San Tan.  As far as the breadsticks go, they were hot; however, the marinara was stone cold.  If allowed, I would rate Red Brick 0 stars.

Very good, clean, tasty choices.  The soup and sandwich combo is a great choice for a light lunch.  Both the Passion fruit and Green Tea Iced tea I had were delicious. The Potato Cream Cheese soup was really good.  The BLT with smooth and creamy avocado was also 5 stars. Great bread = great sandwich.  The Gilbert location is spotless with friendly service

Delicious pizza, bruschetta planks and one of my top 3 favorite Red Sangrias. Fresh, flavorful toppings on the pizza.  If you're in the mood to experiment, try the brussel sprout pizza.  I was pleasantly surprised. My favorite pizza is the truffled mushroom.  Heaven.

I am surprised at all the 5 star reviews.  Café Monarch is mediocre for the expense.  My boyfriend surprised me for my 40th birthday with a dinner at Café Monarch.  We were impressed with the restaurant concept, high end, delectable fare, operated as a one-man show.    The starter white bean soup was bland and the main meal was very, very spicy.  It took about 3 hours to get through only three courses; it was BYOB unfortunately the owner/chef charged us a corking fee.   We were not able to choose what we wanted for dinner, we only noted any food allergies we may have had and the chef prepared surprise spicy beef dishes.  When making the reservation, the owner/chef/waiter offered to make a special birthday treat and asked my boyfriend what my favorite dessert was.  He told him that  I love cupcakes and Chef said he would make them for us.  At the end of our meal, he informed us that he had sold all of my cupcakes.  That was absolutely, positively, 100% unacceptable.  I do understand why it took so long to prepare and serve the meals, but just that he sold out all of my birthday cupcakes, not even just saving one for the birthday girl, was disappointing.  Unfortunately, I will not visit Café Monarch again.

It was OK, not 4 stars.  Authentic Italian to me is walking in the door and being overwhelmed by the smell of garlic, fresh baked Italian bread and hearing Italian music being played softly throughout the establishment.  I've had the $30.00, family style, 5 course meal at Maggiano's that blew this place away.  Our meal was over $ 100 at La Calabria. (including tip)  I am an Italian from the East Coast, so I am a snob when it comes to Italian food.  I did LOVE the ricotta pie we had for dessert and they do make an excellent cappuccino.  Some suggestions for La Calabria... dimmer lighting, maybe a candle on the table for a little ambience, lower prices and a more cheerful wait staff.

Sketchy on the outside, but as they say, it's what's on the inside that counts. I had a 10 piece wing combo plate with 2 sauce choices; Honey Habanero and Citrus Chipotle. The wings were drowning in sauce.  Soooo juicy and delicious.  The chicken is cooked perfectly.  Not too greasy, cooked through, the chicken was moist and tender.  You will not leave here hungry.  These wings had some meat on them.  I will be going back to try all 18 flavors. Love the selection of bottomless Kool-Aid flavors.  I also had the (made from scratch) sweet corn bites.  I think they were made with grits inside which made them sweet as pie.

Everyone needs Rehab now and again.  Check in to Rehab Burger and Check out any burger on a pretzel bun.  Their pretzel bun is probably the best I've tasted.  It has that full, salty, pretzelly taste!!!     The sweet potato tots on the side were good too.  Good drink selection and awesome wait staff.

I'm not sure why this place has received 2 and 3 stars.  Maybe it's a few disgruntled employees that left tqla.  We had one of the best tasting dinners I've experienced thus far here in Arizona.  The tamale was perfect, the salsas were toasty warm and delicious, the drinks were absolutely fantastic.  Fresh, chilled, on-tap tequila?  I never knew.  And, how many places have happy hour 7 days a week?  Looking forward to going back very soon!

Great little place.  In addition to good coffee, they make a delicious Italian soda.  The cream costs extra even though a true Italian soda is usually made with cream.  So you need to ask for it.  I ordered a cherry vanilla and a cherry lime flavored soda.  (will probably do raspberry lime next time)  If you're not in the mood for coffee or tea, this is a great alternate beverage option!

Sad to give only 1 star.  I would have given them 5 stars after last years experience at the original truck.  They ran out of the plain bread and could only make the sandwiches out of wheat.  We ordered 2 sandwiches and paid a total of $26.78.  My sandwich was supposed to be grilled with Frito's inside (.75 cents extra), there should have been more than 6 soggy chips in there.  VERY disappointed with that.  I probably should have just gotten a plain grilled cheese. For $26.78, we could have purchased about 6 loaves of bread and some fine cheeses and made a MUCH better sandwich at home.  I won't be going back and I hope they lose some stars here.  I also 'Unliked' them on Facebook. OUCH It seems they may have a new fleet of smaller trucks which attend events and serve across the valley, however, it's just not the same experience anymore.

Horrible.  Please don't waste a dime here. As Jessica P. states below, I also had very high hopes for Iceberg since I am a shake and frappe lover. The ice cream tasted fake and I took about 4 bites and was done. I don't see this place lasting for too long here.  There are too many other places within a half mile radius with better tasting shakes.

Wow!  I wish I had read these reviews before going in for my oil change today.  I checked in on Yelp but did not read the reviews until just now.  I can totally relate.  I had contact with 3 different female customer service reps.  Only one was semi courteous, the other two?  Zero professionalism.  No greeting, no thank you Miss Tzannos, nothing.  While checking out, a fourth representative overheard my conversation regarding an error on my bill and she came right over to adjust my invoice to 0.00.  She is the only reason Earnhardt Dodge is even getting this 1 star.  Then I was referred to Alan Clark.  I briefly spoke with him regarding my alignment issues.  No greeting.  No "Thank you for your business".  No customer service whatsoever from him and  1/2 the team that was there today.  (After reading another review below about how Alan Clark is dishonest and lazy; I will NOT be dealing with him at any point in the future.)  Alan told me that I would be charged $69.00 for them to evaluate my vehicle for the alignment issue.  Really?  I think I'll wait and call back on Monday to speak with a supervisor.  (If that will even help)  Hopefully if not, there is another Jeep dealership I can visit.

Delicious!  Authentic!  The burrata was amazing.  I actually liked it more than the mozzarella.  Everything is made from scratch, in house.  So glad they are local because good pizza is hard to find in AZ.  We had the Fungi.  Can hardly wait to try their Tiramisu. Find this hidden gem and go enjoy a pizza and Red Sangria.
