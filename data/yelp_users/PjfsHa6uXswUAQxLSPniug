My car had rain/water spots on it.  I pulled in and the guy says We can probably get rid of those water spots.   I looked at him and said well I hope so this is a car wash right?  Tried to upsell me.  They do that every time I'm there.  It's so annoying.   And two people took money from me in there and didn't even look up and smile.   Just moved to a new area and looking forward to finding a new spot.

I love Dr Briones!  Love her office.  Used to be with an office in Scottsdale when I worked up there.  They were awful.   She listens to you, spends time with you, she is great.  I am SO happy I made the switch to her office.  Everyone is so friendly too. Dr. Brione is the best Dr. I have had in 10 years.   Patty V.

Laura has helped me multiple times for both home and auto.  She is great.  Always on time for appointments and has helped in emergency several times.  Very professional and affordable.  Work is great.  Excellent service.  Wouldn't use anyone else.  I've locked my keys in my trunk a few times so I need her on speed dial.  :-)

I pulled in the Dunkin Donuts so I could get a small coffee to put in my thermal cup for my car.  I asked them for a small cup of decaf.  I was told they were out of small cups and I'd have to buy a medium.   I asked them if they could just give me less coffee in a medium cup and he said no.  I kind of looked at him and said so I have to buy a medium because you're out of small and then throw it out because that much coffee won't fit in my thermos.  He said he was sorry for the inconvenience.   So it's only $.30 more but it was the principal.  I shouldn't have to pay for more coffee than I want only to be throwing it out because they are out of cups.   Shaking head. Patty

Love them!   I've been a client for about 4 years.   It's the best work out in town.   Love that it's always different.  Muscle confusion!   They want you to succeed in your fitness goals and can adapt a work out if you have an injury.   They are the best.  Morgan rocks!  :-)
