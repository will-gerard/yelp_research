They are so nice and attentive here.  I like wings, beers, food, and good company.  So I have no complaints!

I always come here to get my eyebrows done. Its very hard to find a good eyebrow place and someone you trust!   Love that its close to home and not wicked expensive for a simple request!  Im definitely a regular here.

Best pad thai, and king of garlic dishes in the valley! Reasonable prices.  Fabulous happy hour as well!

Mmmmm. Never disappoints.  Kind of small restaurant, definitely has that hole in the wall feel. There is a Quiet staff, but that's okay, they aren't rude or anything, I much rather be busy eating my yummers! Pho beef, so delish. No complaints from me!

It's not very often that I give a place five stars.  Especially Chinese food.   I went around 1:30 pm on a Monday. The place was empty but this did not bother me.  I was greeted with positive warm smiles asking if I would like to be seated or if my order was to go.   I got my order to go and I was out the door within 10-15 minutes,  again no complaints,  the food is worth the wait!!   I'm a big calamari junkie, with that being said I have had my fair share of calamari experience around the world,  good and bad.  This place has instantly made it to my top five favorite calamari places.  It was different from what I was used to but it still made the list.  The calarmi rings came lightly fried and breaded,  with sprinkles of jalape√±o, onions,  and carrots,  and to my surprise - - octopus.  I was a tad thrown off but I'm very open minded and whoooa,  it was delicious.    I also like potstickers, I got an order of six and unfortunately one ended up in my mouth before I took a picture!  They look deeply fried,  but they definitely don't taste like it.  Call me picky,  but there is a thing called too deep fried.  I will be getting these again for sure.    Chicken chow mein,  I'm also a noodle freak.  I love my chow mein,  lo mein, suey, and so on so forth.  If you're looking for panda express chow mein,  don't order this,  because you'll surely be disappointed!  This style of chow mein was not heavily sauced,  which is what I prefer,  but at the same time it was extremely flavorful and delicious.    I'm sure you are tired of reading at this point,  but you can't tell me I didn't tell you about the orange chicken lunch special!   Crab puff - yum.  Wish I got more.   Egg roll-eh didn't care much for it.  It was like a spring roll with the egg roll stuffings.  My taste buds were confused.  Orange chicken - yum yum yum.  You can definitely tell that it is house made.  (or home made for you newbies)  which made it even more phenomenal!   If you get a chance,  go here.  You'll fall in love and leave panda express in the dust!!

My cat scan appointment was at 230, they asked me to come in at 215. I got off work early (12pm) so I thought I would swing by to see if they could make time for me right then and there.  They did!  Handed me the paperwork and got me right back.  So that was very awesome of them.  I did not wait any longer than five minutes..   Reasons why four stars-  1-prices are a big outrageous but I did not have time to shop around 2-collecting Co pay BEFORE I got the work done is kind of different and very unusual.

Would not recommend this store.   There were dirty female products on the floor.  Food,  toilet paper,  just looked like a downright dirty Highway rest stop bathroom.  Disgusting.   I can only imagine the rest of the store!

This is definitely one of those, dont judge a book by its cover type of places. The outside looks a little sketchy, but the inside is welcoming and pretty nice looking for a burger shack!     When I walked in, I was greeted with a very warm, "hello, how are you?!"  They made it super easy to order.  What I definitely loved about this place was the made to order burgers. Its not like other places where its frozen burgers being made, they use real meat! It was absolutely delish, and my stomach was doing millions of cartwheels of pure happiness. I will definitely be returning

This place is heaven for vegetarians and those that prefer gluten free foods. You definitely get your money's worth here. Essence has a Great atmosphere, great friendly staff to match as well.  I got the chance to have a strawberry delight macaroons as well. So delish. I have no complaints!  :)

I would absolutely never go here again.  I do not drink but I absolutely love to dance. Its over crowded, I expected it to be crowded, but not to the point where I cant even turn around!. I didnt have bottle service but I was near a v.i.p. table and the waitress was being a total batch (if you know what I mean). I was dancing and a beer bottle was on the floor and instead of kicking it again and dancing on it or someone possibly getting hurt, I picked it up and put it on the v.I.p. table and she turned around and tried to hand it to me. I explained it was not mine because I do not drink. She proceeded to shove it on my chest forcefully and demanded I take it, instead of listening to me!.  If you dont like your job, dont work there!!!!

Im  fan of lolos on South Central.  I thought I'd give this new location a shot.   My food took a long time,  I've seen my food come faster on a busy night,  and I was there on a slow night.   Second of all,  I got red velvet cake,  to go like I always do.  It was a TINY piece, not to mention,  it tasted like it had been sitting on the counter for two weeks.  Just horrible.    Not convinced to return to this location.

Phenomenal food!!  I also had the gumbo but I did not feel that it was real true gumbo more of a jambalaya then anything but it was still delicious!!  Our waiter Chris was amazing and tended to all of our needs.  We even got to speak with the manager and gave her big thumbs up which is a big deal coming from foodies!  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone!
