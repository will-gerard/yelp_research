Was very impressed with these guys. I had a plug pulled out of its socket in my car that I kept forgetting to fix cause it was on the passenger side so I do not see it unless I am on that side, and they went ahead and fixed it for me. They are really great

I came here for an estimate on some damage on my car. I found them through Yelp and because of their great reviews went here.  Kevin Mitchell was wonderful.  I felt completely at ease here and he showed me where I actually had more damage on my car than I thought I did.  He wrote up an estimate for me and did not try to get me to schedule that day or push me into anything.  Once I get my estimate done through my insurance, I will definitely come back here to get the work done because I feel they will do great work and they care about their results and their customers.  Thank you Kevin  Mandy Brehm

Just had omg chicken. That is the name for it, and omg it was amazing. It is a grilled chicken breast with a spicy cilantro honey pesto, jalape√±o jack cheese over napa cabbage slaw on ciabatta bread

Jabz is the best thing that has ever happened to me. U work every part of ur body, the staff is great n u dont get bored cause u don't do the same thing every day. I love it. Been going for a year and a half n will go for more years to come

Lady at front hostess stand was great. Even opened door for us when we left. Our waitress Cheryl was great. Never ran out of drinks n was there is we needed anything. The food was great. Had the wings n they were yummy. All of their food was really good. Only thing that was bad here is there were no lights on in parking lot n when we left it was pitch dark. The lights r there but weren't on. Not good

Once again we have no water. This seems to happen every 3-4 weeks. Of course u r never notified If the water is being shut off or if it's a water main break. They should have all new piping by now with how much it breaks

Must say worst service ever. Tc n I both ordered food. I got mine. Waited 20 min n Tc never got his food. I had to ask waitress if he was ever going to get his food. She goes to check n then tells us they don't have the special. Seriously!!! Took 20 minutes to tell us that. Never will go again. Oh n she tells me their cook didn't come in like that makes it ok

Mountainside has a massage therapist onsite. Her name is Sabrina Hargrave. 907-250-5077. Had my first massage with her tonight n it was great. She made me feel really comfortable n listened to what I needed. She does chair massage n table massage. Prices r really reasonable for members n non members. Chair massages r $1 per minute for member n nonmember. Table massage is $45 for members n $60 for non members for an hour. Try her out she is great
