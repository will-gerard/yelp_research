I think this grooming business is one of the WORST places I have ever been to! I am a cosmetologist myself and deal with prices, costumers, and changes every day. I am always willing to please my clients and give them my service with a smile This place on the other hand is NOT! The owner and staff is absolutely unprofessional and rude. She and the people that work there have NO sense of costumer service or good business sense. We took our dogs there for the second time and went through the most unbelievably horrid experience. We drooped our two large dogs off at 8:30 am. Two hours later we received a phone call at 10:30am to let us know that our lab was done BUT the Akita was not. He was not done because the owner wanted to let me know that she was not going to honor the previous grooming price that was written on his card. She continued to tell me, with a nasty attitude that she was going to charge me more and if I didn't want to pay more than I could come pick up the dog. We decided that the business etiquette was so horrendous that we were going to pick them up. When we arrived at the shop..we were promptly told in our face that we were charged $50 last time..where they then showed us the amount charged as $50 on his client card. How can a business literally show us what they charged last time then argue that they were holding my dog hostage id we did not pay MORE? Who does that??Then AMAZINGLY owner and another worker attacked me verbally and laterally GOT IN MY FACE to block my way to leave. I absolutely cannot believe this place is in business. This was the absolute WORST place i have ever spent my hard earned money and i would N E V E R recommend anyone to EVER go there!

This grooming place is AWESOME !!  I have had my share of terrible places and just OK places..but Kosmos doghouse is GREAT!  My Akita left looking absolutely terrific.  The shop has great service and such a good welcoming feeling.  They took great care of my dog and I will be back! It is worth the price for great people that do a great job.
