Came here for my bachelorette and had a great time with my crew.  +Guys are pretty hot, flexible, and decently good dancers.  But you can tell Magic Mike has really influenced them, a lot of baseball caps.  (but sadly no Channing Tatum!)  +Guys aren't overly aggressive unless you let them be (LOL)  +Outrageous fun crowd.  +If you get tired of the guys, go to the girls floor :)  -Saw two dancers making out with girls.  Come on, keep it professional boys

I usually stay on the strip in vegas and eat mostly on the strip.  My brother's gf recommended us to try this place and it was only about a ten minute drive away so we thought why not.  I was pleasantly surprised!  They have an all you can eat menu for about $25 a person for dinner and the selection and quality you get is really good.  Everything tasted really fresh and the rolls didn't have too much rice on it.  I'll definitely be going back again.  The only bad thing about this place is the waitress we had tried to memorize our order and didn't really write anything down.  She forgot some parts of our order which ended up being okay because we over ordered.  Try to get their early, it was super crowded even though we got there around 5p for dinner and the place is relatively small.

Came here because of the good Yelp reviews when we were looking for a restaurant off the strip but not too far off, thanks Yelp!  +Location: Easy to get to off the strip and lots of parking  +Ambiance: A little kitschy but very welcoming, tons of awards everywhere so you know it's good.  +Food: Hearty big portions of Mediterranean food that you can definitely share. +Steak/Chicken Kabobs: Nicely cooked, juicy inside and served with salad, grilled veges and rice.   I definitely think two people can share this unless you're super hungry. +Combination Platter: A smorgasburg of different appetizers, I think this is something fun to eat and share as a group.  Easily shareable between 3-4 people.  +Service.   +Price.  Definitely quality food with large portions and great service.

I've heard so much about this place being "THE BEST" Thai food ever so we were very eager to go try it.  I have to say I'm disappointed.  Not sure if it's what we ordered but we tried the top 3 yelped items.  Location: It's located slightly off the strip so very convenient to get to however the strip mall is old and ghetto.  When we came at 5p it looked dark and abandoned however by 5:30p when they open for dinner there was a huge line waiting to get in.  Service: Good and FAST, we got our food a few minutes after ordering it surprisingly.  Food: Nam kao tod - The first bite of this salad was amazing.  The crispy rice is crispy and is packed with flavor.  However by the second and third bite, it was way too salty.  Would not order this again  Tom Yum soup- Salty but standard  Crispy duck and drunken noodles- The duck was very crispy and good.  However the duck to noodle ratio seemed off.  There was like 80% duck and 20% noodles which I guess most people would feel is worth it but I like having more noodles.  After a few bites we were out of noodles and were just eating duck alone  Overall: Good but not the best Thai food I've ever had and it's a bit pricey.  I feel like you can have the same type of Thai food at other restaurants for cheaper.  Tip: Long lines sometime but the restaurant is HUGE so it goes very quickly.

My boyfriend brought my here for our 4 year anniversary as a surprise and I really hadn't heard anything about the show so I didn't know what to expect.  La Reve literally blew me away.  I've watched a few cirque shows and the premise is basically the same: good music, acrobats, and some kind of underlying story line.  But La Reve is based around a love story and a dream so the whole show had that dreamy feel.  The ambiance was breathtaking and the music really matched it.  The water elements in the show were flawless.  I also loved how they incorporated ball room dance with their usual acrobats.  I would definitely recommend this to any cirque fans or for a romantic date.

I don't want to do too detailed a review on this because it's a pretty simple pizzeria.  I think it's NY Style so you get large slices of pizza but it's not your typical thin crust.  Lots of different toppings but nothing irregular.  Pizza tasted okay, not bad.  Nothing memorable.  Nothing I'd crave but I would eat it again if it was convenient.  I don't know, you're in Vegas.  The food game has to be stepped up when you're around all this other good food.

Finally tried this place after many attempts (it's easy to get sidetracked in Vegas!)  And yes, I do think this Sandwich place lives up to the hype.  It's basically a really good panini with tasty fillings, how can you go wrong?  +The artisan bread they use is really good.  And filling.  And a bit greasy.  It really coats the stomach if you know what I mean. +Veggie sandwich was VERY good.  +Long lines but they move really fast.  As a side note, the sandwich was really good when I was sober.  But after a night of drinking, the leftovers were amazing!

**Review is exclusively for day care and NOT boarding**  +Friendly, helpful staff +Clean facility +Iphone app so you can see your doggies at any time +Affordable +Close to the strip +Dogs played all day and were totally exhausted.  They really got all their energy out  Tip for Boarding: We asked about boarding and there is NO staff there with the dogs at night.  They have a motion sensor and security patrolling.

Definitely a lounge and not a day club.  So don't get that twisted (i.e. don't expect big banger DJs, the hottest people, etc.).  That being said...  +Ambiance.  It's cool and slick looking.  Very modern even though it's small.  Love that there were little toy water guns everywhere.  +Drinks and food.  The drinks they had were delicious!  And all of us thought the food was great too.  +Easy to get in BUT  -NO WHERE TO SIT if you don't do bottle service.  Don't come here if you're not going to pay for it.  -Service.  I'm mixed about this.  Our server/waitress/lounge maid (whatever they are called) was great.  She was really helpful and checked on us a lot.  However the guy who let us in was not very accommodating and we almost walked out.  But for 13 people for $1k (Day bed & 2 lounge chairs), it was worth it.  -SMALL!  It's small  Anyhow I had a great crew so I still had a good time.  Good to chill with the homies, but not to meet people.

Reminds me of many other hipster places you'd eat brunch at in LA (that's a good thing)  +Food: Brunch with a little twist.  Very good. -Huevos Motulenos: This was my least favorite of the things we ordered.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't very memorable.  Sauces were nice, eggs were cooked well, plaintain was a nice surprise but overall it was okay for me. +Cinnamon Biscuits: Plated really beautifully with berries and warm strawberry compote.  The biscuits were fluffy and delicious and the compote had just the right amount of sweetness. +Corned Beef Hash: If you're a corned beef type of person, it's the right dish for you.  It wasn't overly salty, it was cooked well and crispy, eggs were perfection.  Also the fluffy sourdough was just awesome to eat with it.  +Price: I think it was affordable (~$15+ a person)  +Décor: Very cute and hipster.    +Wait: Wasn't too bad actually.  I expected a huge wait on a Sunday but for 8 people, it was about 30 minutes.  The food came out very quickly as well.  Overall, I'd definitely eat here again.  I like getting away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.

In the words of my boyfriend, "This is the best Vegas buffet I've ever been to"  Pros -HUGE, there's so much selection so there's something for everyone (Seafood, meat, mexican, pizza, pasta, asian, etc.) -Staff was very attentive -Everything we sampled was good and "authentic" enough -Seafood fresh -Nice dessert section (tons of ice cream and mochi, cookies, cupcakes, macaroons, pies, etc.)  Cons -Long lines (we came at 8p and walked right in so we lucked out but we've heard there can be crazy lines) -It's expensive (~$115 for two for dinner from what I remember).

Located a few minutes off the strip in a strip mall.  My expectations were low but I was extremely pleased with the food and overall experience of this place.  Food: DELICIOUS.  It's Japanese cuisine with a modern twist, exactly like the title infers.  You have your usual raw dishes with something unexpected. +Brussel Sprouts: Caramelized and yummy, an excellent appetizer to start with. +Edamame: Garlicky and delicious +Tuna tataki: Tuna was meaty and well seasoned with soy but not salty.   +Scallop: Served on it's shell the presentation was stunning.  It was a delicious bite balanced by the cream sauce. +Soft Shell Crab: This was okay.  Fried soft shell crab always tastes about the same to me.   +Sake Orenji: Their signature dish, the salmon pairs really well with the orange flavor.  Very delicate and original.  Service: The waitress really went into detail on the menu and making recommendations.  Each dish was presented to us with an explanation.  It made it an experience.  Decor: Cool and modern asian.  Price: Yes it's expensive but you're getting quality food.  Overall Loved IT.  The entire experience was amazing and I can't wait to come back to Vegas to try it again.

This is the old Imperial Palace.  When you first walk into the casino, the front has been newly renovated so it's new and it doesn't smell funky like it used to BUT DON'T BE FOOLED.  They are still in the process of a massive update/upgrade.  Pros -Cheap  -Centrally located  Cons -Old Imperial Palace room, rooms have NOT been renovated yet -Back of casino NOT renovated -Couldn't find parking some nights -Staff didn't know what was going on  Tip: This is "pet friendly" however besides a Pet Relief area, there's nothing else pet friendly about it.  Tip2: Don't stay here until it's finished being renovated, it's not worth the money.

Not sure if people even read food truck reviews on Yelp but here goes :D  +Legit Filipino food.  You can see the titas in the back cooking it up.  Don't expect anything fancy or anything crazy, there's only 2-3 different items.  +Lumpia.  Nice and crispy with sweet and sour sauce.  +Chicken entry and Pork Belly, can't go wrong with either!  +The food came out quick and hot even though there was a huge line.  It was the most comforting thing to have after a night of drinking at the Rise festival, so sad they're not in LA!

Came here for Memorial weekend.  I have to say it's my least favorite pool party in Vegas.  -The two main pool areas are tiny.  There wasn't many people here on a Monday yet we couldn't find a place to sit or put our stuff. -The rules are so strict!  The security pool guy blows his whistle and points at people when they break a rule.  You can't drink in the pool, you can't put your stuff too close to the planter, you can't splash water, etc.  Seriously?  He was blowing his whistle all day.  +Nice view since it's a rooftop pool.  If it wasn't for that I would have given 1 star.

Located in SLS, it's of course very cool and trendy.  Taxidermy type décor everywhere and a little eccentric.  +Food.  Yes they specialize in meat.  If you come here, please make sure you order their meat items! +Fresh West Coast Oysters: These were so good.  You get a choice of east coast or west coast oysters.  I always do west coast because they're smaller and sweeter.  To each their own on this.  You can't go wrong with fresh oysters! -Cotton Candy Foie Gras: Looks really cool, make sure to order one per person.  Foie that is encased in cotton candy.  The sweet cotton candy is in stark contrast to the salty foie, not something we'd order again.   -Croquetas de Pollo: This was okay, basically tasted like a fried chicken pot pie. -Sloppy Joe: I thought this was just okay.  My friend who loves hamburgers liked this but really, I think for such a nice and fancy place, you could order something better. +Flat Iron: Very flavorful and tender.  It was our favorite cut of meat from the three we ordered.   +Skirt Steak: Also good and tender but flat iron was better (our whole table of 8 agreed) +Wagyu Beef Cheeks: Very unctuous and delicious.  There was no gameness and possibly the most tender beef cheeks I've ever had.  +Service: Excellent service.  The waitress kept checking on us.  -Pricey: Or course it is!  -Cocktails: this was just OK.  We tried one with passionfruit and another one that has mescal, both were unimpressive.  Tips: 1.  Make a reservation if possible 2.  Order the meat as soon as you sit down, it takes time. I want to try the suckling pig next time and it takes a full hour to cook 3.  Come hungry!  We were so bummed we couldn't eat more and try more. 4.  Don't come with cheapskates 5.  Dress up

Okay so this club is further along the strip, I actually hadn't even heard of it until I went this past weekend but I had a great time!  (might be because Steve Angello was spinning though :)  +Decor/Club.  Love all the modern lights in it.  It's very open, not too many stairs so girls don't have to worry about falling or tripping.  It's small but very modern.   +Photobooth.  Because I love photobooths.  +Drinks/bars.  It was easy enough to get drinks, it didn't get too crowded.  +Easy to get in.  But I'm a girl, so maybe I'm not a good judge on that.  -Crowd.  Sorry to say there were NOT that many good looking guys.  But I had fun dancing anyhow!

Close to giving this place 5 stars if not for the rude valet staff.  +decor/ambiance - beautiful large indoor and outdoor space.  Tons of bistro lighting and entirely hipster.   +service (except for valet) - very friendly and kept checking up on us. +food.  Everything we tried was delicious  Gorgonzola chicken salad - nice balanced salad with a lot of flavor and creaminess from Gorgonzola  Butternut squash cannoli - perfection!  I love pasta with butternut squash and this did not disappoint.  Monkey bread - if you like desserts with a texture contrast and temperature contrast, this was delicious.  Parts of the dessert were crispy from the oven and paired well with the ice cream. +cocktails and drinks - all the cocktails had an interesting twist and were interesting.  I ordered the Room Service and was super happy!  The alcohol is well masked by the strawberry and I could have drank a few of them easily.  -valet staff - so we came around 8p on a Monday and maybe valet service already ended for the night but there are signs everywhere that state valet parking only.  We pulled up to valet and the guys there were all busy talking and ignored us for a few minutes.  Finally one of them said park it yourself.  Thanks guys.
