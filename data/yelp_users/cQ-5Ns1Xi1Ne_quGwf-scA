I tried to come up  with one nice memory of Michaels Craft stores, but sadly none exist!  So I guess I will share my favorite moments that keep my sister and I laughing when we talk about them. As with all Michaels, they were pushing everyone out the door well before closing time.  I was overcharged on a few items, which is also typical for all Michaels.  I called the store after realizing that they charged me for an item that I didn't get that was over $8 (anything over $7 on an overcharge annoys me enough to actually make a phone call to let them know about it) but it was six minutes after they closed, and no one would answer the phone and they didn't have a recording or a way to leave a message which is ridiculous to not have a recorded message at least providing the address and business hours.  I called three times, just in case, they were on another line, but I am sure they had already rushed out the door, since they had the place locked up and no one else was allowed inside when I was leaving at 7:52.  I thought it was a bit odd that they also pull all of their outside sale bins inside at 7pm making it impossible to actually see anything in the entire front area where they crammed them inside the door.  I really wish they could stop the announcements about when the store closes every five minutes for the last hour or TWO that they are supposed to be open, and focus on helping make the cluttered store a little easier to walk through, as well as checking the sale signs for accuracy (huge issues with items ringing up correctly every single time I have been there) I was in a Michaels last year around Christmas time that made this announcement at 6pm,  "The time is now 6pm, Michaels will be closing in two hours, please make your final selections and bring them to the register at this time"  I thought it was a joke, but they made the announcement every ten minutes until I was so annoyed that I got the hell out of there!  My cart was full at that point, so I parked it by the register that the repeated announcements were coming from.  I thought I would help them pass the time between announcements by putting all of my $200 or so dollars  worth of merchandise away since I would be buying it at Joann's instead!    When I buy something from a sale bin with three signs listing the price of the item,  and then get charged more at the register, and told by the cashier that "the signs must be old" and she "doesn't know why they are still hanging", MAYBE IT WOULD BE A GOOD DECISION TO REMOVE THE SIGNS AT THAT POINT, but they didn't, because when I had to return that evening to get my son something for a school project, they were still hanging even though the cashier refused to let me buy them at the price they still had on them.  If you need some help with management, and customer service, I would suggest researching successful entrepreneurs and their business models for a guide before losing the rest of your customers to Hobby Lobby and Joann's, or maybe some brilliant entrepreneur who comes along and builds the best craft store imaginable, but throws in something that all three craft stores seems to lack; EXCELLENT, FRIENDLY, CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  Sam Walton, founder of Walmart, said, "There is only one boss. The customer, and he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else." He knew the importance of providing good customer service, and as a business, you probably should too!

The Floridino's on Alma School is not connected to this restaurant in any way.  The owners of Floridino's in Chandler opened this location back in 2000, but they sold it over ten years ago, and it has sold a few times since then.  The food and menu are different, and the current owners have NEVER trained as a franchise or paid for a franchise, and unfortunately the Chandler Floridino's ends up looking like they are the same company, because the owner in Gilbert is using the name due to a technical loop hole in the paperwork, but it is not only shady business practice to do this, it also hurts the reputation of the owners of the Chandler location who have worked for over 15 years to build their business to the success it is.

I love this store!  I thought everything was going to be crazy expensive when I walked in, but I was pleasantly surprised to see the incredibly low prices on the beautiful pieces of hand blown glass.  The owners have become friends and out the sweetest couple around!  They give so much to the city and other local businesses, and they have a genuine interest in making downtown Chandler a fun and inviting place for people to enjoy.  Please stop in this shop and see for yourself what a wonderful find it truly is!

I would like to share my experience or rather my child's experience this evening at the "Parent's Night Out" Hosted by Bounce U in Gilbert. My daughter who is 5 was tormented by a group of bullies that were also beating up on other children throughout the night, but for some reason were never removed from the play area. Luckily my 11 year old son was also there to protect my daughter, but I am baffled by the fact that he informed two of the three staff members that she was being trapped in the girl's bathroom by this group and they did NOTHING to help! In fact, my son finally had to go into the girl's restroom where the kids had pulled her in and were trying to lock her in the stall and hurt her! This entire evening has my blood boiling! The workers (teenagers and maybe one adult) were not only too young to be left in charge of that many children, but also completely untrained to be responsible for protecting and keeping more than 30 young children safe for three hours! There are no play facilities that I know of that hand out ice packs for injuries like they are handing out popsicles! There were other parents who were complaining to the front desk about their children being hurt and bullied all night as my husband was trying to find out why nothing was done to protect our daughter who was holding an ice pack on her head when he arrived. Bounce U is completely responsible for the care and safety of these children when they host these Parent's Night Out events, so to leave teenagers in charge and put our children in danger is absolutely deplorable and nothing more than a way to bring in over a thousand dollars with minimal cost! My daughter begged us to NEVER take her back there again! I am positive she won't have to worry about that ever happening again!

This is a tiny grab and go version of the delicious locally owned Dilly's Delis around the valley.  Of course it is no where near the menu of the actual restaurants they have outside of the airport, but obviously that is because it is a Kiosk in an airport.  The wraps are delicious and better than most of the larger restaurants in the airport by far in my opinion.  If you are wanting the yummy soups in homemade bread bowls, you will have to drive the 2 miles to University and Hardy Dilly's Deli, but you can still get a great ready to go wrap or sandwich in 2 minutes and still make the flight that has started boarding!  I am thrilled to see little locally owned shops have made it into the sky harbor airport and hope that people will remember that they are in fact supporting local establishments and not the big chains found at most airports!
