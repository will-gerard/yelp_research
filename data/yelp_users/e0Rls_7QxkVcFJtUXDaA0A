So I've been here twice.  Both times, I thought the food was excellent.  Sam's enchiladas, while non-traditional, are admittedly my favorite in town; they are significantly better than Barrio Café.  The portions are huge; the prices, very reasonable; and the atmosphere, especially the beautiful outdoor patio near the fountain, is fantastic on nice Phoenix days.    And this is all before you consider the chips.  Good gracious, the chips and salsa!  Five star worthy chips and salsa.

It's really not a bad place to watch a game.  Big TVs, decent beer choices, edible fried foods, nice staff.  With a few changes it could be a 4 star joint.   But here's the deal:  every time some schmo orders their signature two foot long hotdog  platter called the "Big Unit" - a horrifying, shrill, alarm rings off and the staff simultaneously yells the eponymous name.    When I was there, 17 such "Units" were purchased in rapid succession.   I watched the rest of the game in fear of another order.    Thanks for the PTSD Alice Cooper!

This was a sadness pile on a failure plate.   I have had worse but never in a place so widely considered a treasure by the Yelping community.  From recent reviews it looks like this place is a shell of its former glory and that's sad, because the potential is there. From my experience tonight, the rumors may be true.

The sad fact is that most yelpers will eschew this place for it's two more accessible neighbors - Filiberto's and La Santisma - and that is a damn shame, because nestled right between those two restaurants is a superior dining experience.    Tacos Mexico is the truth.  Don't go expecting fancy furniture or Day of The Dead iconography - this place isn't trying to serve you a Disneyland version of Mexico - what it will give you is an authentic taste of some damn fine Mexican tacos.    PS - their red salsa will burn a hole in your tongue.  If you treat it gingerly, however, you will be treated to a flavor bomb like no other!

Finding out how to gain access to this place is the greatest barrier to its success (it's a challenge), after you figure it out, brush up on your highschool spanish then be wowed by some pretty darn good pupusas.    The juevos con chorizo are smokey and delicious and blow my mind each time I get em.

Full disclosure:  It's probably getting a bump because it's so close.  That said, I was hungry, wanted Mexican, and Juan's did not disappoint.  Green Chili pork burro totally hit the spot - atmosphere was clean and welcoming.  Chili Relleno was good, not mind blowing, but certainly not the worst.  I'd go back for sure... In fact since its so close, I could see it being a go to spot for the south of the border cravings.  Which reminds me... I'm overdue for a Soñoran dog.

Love this place.  Hakata Ramen is the best bowl of noodles in town.  Sure, it's no Shinsengumi of Los Angeles - but in Phoenix this is as good as it gets.

I so badly want a Chicago style Italian beef joint near my house - and though I live just a few blocks away  - Luke's of Chicago is not it.   I've been here twice - each time brimming with optimism at the hope of getting an approximation of the real deal.  Both times I was treated to hard, stale bread, bland meat, flavorless jus, burnt greasy fries.  I am sure my craving will return at some point - and because LOC is the closest thing in the area, I am sure I will be tempted.  I am leaving this review to remind myself to not waste my time.

This is just a depressing store.  Any comments describing it would only pile on, and I'm just not that kind of dude.  I've never used the term "mercy killing" to describe a commercial establishment, but if there were an occasion this might be it.

For what it is, a neighborhood sports bar and grill, the AG exceeds on all counts.  Off track betting, usually friendly service, amazing drink deals, and surprisingly great food - their Armadillo Gold wings may very well be the best in town.    What you won't get here is hipster pretension - but if you're looking for an unassuming place to grab a drink and budget friendly nosh and maybe bet on a horse race - this, ladies and germs, should be your stopping place.

Absolutely love this place!  French bistro food at a reasonable price - gratis dessert and croissants.  Simple, casually elegant, a little noisy - and by all means yummy.  Its really hard to not like the offerings.     This gets 5 stars for filling a really awesome niche in Central Phoenix.

Friendly service and a funky throwback ambiance make this place a fun alternative to delicious food.  I love a good hot dog, but I'm not convinced that Ted's serves one.   Still, it may be worth a trip to bask in their quirky ambience... And who knows, maybe one of their Loganberry milkshakes.    But, hotdogs, I'll cozy up to a Sonoran stand next time I have a craving.

This place is the best thing going on in this area.    In a neighborhood known more for warehouses than restaurants I was pleasantly surprised by how good Rita's is.  Great salsa - and definitely above average food!  Great rice, tasty beans, and the shrimp flautas were awesome!     I've also had the huevos and chorizo there which were spot on delicious!  Friendly staff and clean dining area.

Good.  Cheap.  Tasty.   24/7.  Drive through.   That sums this place up.    Highlights:   Their Carnitas platter comes in a styrofoam plate with beans, rice, and two giant tortillas, weighs quite literally 2 lbs, and is enough to put two people to sleep for a little more than 7 dollars.  Now that's bang for your buck.    Taquitos plate - at 4.50 - also good.  Burritos of all sorts but stay away from the fish.  Carnitas is probably the best.  Asada is a little gristly but good.  Barbacoa not bad.  Breakfast is quite tasty too.  Asada Fries will put you down for the count.   But you're not paying for a glamorous atmosphere - or heat on a cold day, so don't expect it.   I'd recommend it for a late nights, when you're really hungry

I believe there may be a new Vietnam War brewing over which Valley stalwart serves up the best Vietnamese cuisine: Da Vang or Pho Thanh.  And after having sampled both on multiple occasions, I have decided that Da Vang is the winner.     Though both places serve great food at reasonable prices Da Vang's food is just a little better - and the main reason is their Thit Nung (grilled pork).  While Pho Thanh serves a grilled ground pork patty, Da Vang serves thin slices - which is far superior.  This one item shifts the entire battle in their favor.   I urge you to try a Banh Mi Thit Nung at both and see for yourself which one is better.    That said for atmosphere, I think Pho Thanh would be more inviting to the average person.   Totally recommended.

The most over-rated Yelp-recommended place I've yet to encounter.    I am a fan of dives.  I like to find places that are a little rough around the edges that serve food to please a local community.  Those places are why I use Yelp in the first place.  OW is a dive, but as such, I judged accordingly.  My 1 star rating has nothing to do with it's atmosphere or clientele.   I will admit that the rating has to do with 3 things, some of which others may not have experienced on their visits.  Sometimes, patrons try a place out and its just a bad day - the kitchen is off, the waiters are slammed, the manager just got divorced.  Unfortunately for those restaurants, "them's the breaks."   You don't often get second chances to make a first impression - and my first impression of the Original Wineburger's blew.  Onto the three things:  First, the burger.  For a venue named after it's signature product, you'd think more attention would be paid to quality.  The burger was served on a very nice bun, but the meat that was on it was by all accounts, flavorless.  I expected a wine taste, or some sweetness, or some aroma.  I and my companion both had to add salt to what was otherwise a patty devoid of taste.  Second, the fries.  Yes, they are beer battered, but I'd be hard pressed to give a place laurels for something that Rally's can replicate.  And to make matters worse, they came to me burned.  Severely burned - like an albino left in the desert without suntan lotion.  Inedible.  We sent them back - but really, how do you screw up fries?  It's not even cooking - you're just waiting for the oil to do its work.  All you have to look at a timer - when a place screws up fries (or toast for that matter) there's anarchy in the kitchen.    Finally, the service.  Now here's where it gets tricky.  Since OW is a dive, I'm not expecting great service.  That's not what they are there to do - the service should be very basic - right?  Take my order, bring me my food in a reasonable time, and bring me my bill with a smile.  That's all.  If it's really busy, I'm even more lenient.   On the night we went, OW was practically empty - there were two other tables in the place.  It took our waitress 15 minutes to greet us.  Which doesn't sound long - but is far longer than most places on a slow night.  When we placed our order, we asked about the wineburger, what's it about?  Since we never had one before, we thought it a reasonable question to ask.  Based on her response, you would have thought we asked her if we could take a crap on her floor.  Our food took a little long to get out to us, but we thought it was due to the painstaking magic that was going on behind the scenes.  When we sent our fries back for fresh ones, we got them long after the burgers were finished, rendering them useless.  The final insult was when trying to leave, we couldn't find our waitress - apparently she took her cigarette break just as we were ready to leave - so we had to flag down another waiter to leave the place.    Again, this experience may be atypical but its real.  Now I ask you fellow Yelpers, when a place gives you bad food and bad service - what rating are you supposed to give them?    I certainly would not recommend this place to any person I like.

Of the 3 scheduled appointments I have made to this banfield, they have been at minimum 30 minutes late each time (the longest being an hour).  Again, these were not walk-ins but scheduled appointments.  Once, I can understand, stuff happens.  But three times and you've got a systemic problem that needs addressing.   I wish I could say that it's due to incredible bedside service. But I suspect that it's due to poor scheduling and staff utilization.

I only give five stars to places that I have been multiple times and been consistently impressed by both the products and the service.  It has to be a place that I would absolutely recommend to anyone, any time.  It has to be, dollar for dollar, a better overall experience.   Mi Cocina, Mi Pais (their name before some ridiculous chain bearing the same name threatened a law suit) unquestionably fits the bill, and was my regular restaurant during grad school.  I have brought several people to dinner here only to have them leave in gushing awe. The food and service are simply soulful.  It's a challenge to find something that I didn't like there, but I found they are especially good at the slow cooking stuff - stews and the like.  The highlight for me is their sanduche de puerco - a slow cooked pork sandwich served with their incredible and noteworthy aji (a salsa so flavorful and addictive that it deserves a special place of honor).  Mi Cocina, Mi Pais is the sort of place that happens when owners take pride in their food and see their products as a reflection of themselves and their home.    Recommended.

One way I judge a restaurant is by how well they recover from mistakes.  My 5 stars is for the way this location's manager, John, recovered from an error their kitchen made.   A well run restaurant acknowledges when it has made a mistake and addresses it promptly and positively - which is exactly what John did.  Because of this PF Chang's service leadership - I will be a repeat customer.

It's been said that "It's the little things that count." While true, it neglects to mention how important the big things are.  Barrio Café is a perfect example of the limitations of this maxim.  You see, Barrio Cafe nails the little things: great art, horchata served in empty Mexican coke bottles, banana leafs on plates, a fantastic mural, pomegranate seeds in the guacamole, a very enjoyable adobo flavored ketchup, a hip ambience, a smartly dressed wait staff - all very well done and deserving of stars.  Where the house of cards crumbles is when the food hits the mouth.  My cochinita pibil sandwich, recommended by the waiter and a signature dish, could only be described as bland.  Served atop two plodding pieces of thick French bread - it made me long for the powerfully flavorful and soft bites at Tortas El Guero down the street.  BC has been out for a while and has a reputation in the area as a winner - maybe their food quality has slipped with a change of chef.    Until the eats get better, barrio cafe will remain, to me, just a place that gets the little things right.    Two little stars

I want to dislike this place.  Why?  Because it's aims to add pretension to the humble hamburger joint - does any town need another restaurant selling a 15$ burger & fries?    But damnit if they don't have a tasty burger and fries.  Well constructed with great flavor and texture combinations.  Their delux burger is unequivocally delicious and, at least the one I was served tonight, perfectly cooked to my specified temperature.  I comment about this because far too few places get the basics correct.  Delux did tonight.

What's not to like about the Bandido?  You've got two of the best hunger cures fused unpretentiously under one roof. At the lil Mexican Panda you get a pretty huge meal topped off with a stellar free cookie for a joke of a price - plus the "in the know" feeling you get when you finally figure out how to order here.  It can be daunting for a first timer.   There are some misses here, because chinese doesn't always fuse well with Mexican, but there are some tried and true classics (I wont repeat the exhaustive list of favorites that other Yelpers have already posted).   Chino Bandido is truly original and highly addicting.  Definitely worth a visit.

If you find yourself on a frontier or delta flight, AND you'd really like an overpriced ticket to intestinal distress HAVE I GOT THE SPOT FOR YOU!  My shrimp salad gets a two word review - "Sh*t Salad"  Horrifyingly bad food, syrupy sweet margaritas, and "What did I do in my previous life to deserve this" service.    One extra star because it's the only booze game on this side of the airport.

Acacia Cafe's is a model of operational efficiency and excellence for a small cafe owner.  How they sustain such low prices at a very high rent area is astounding, but they do it.  Simple food, smart personalized service, and just enough intelligent extras to make the experience feel high quality in every way... that is, except for the prices.  :)

This place has charm - and their food is certainly above average - especially if you're a fan of New Mexican cuisine (which I'm not) you'd be hard pressed to find a better example of it.  The plates are all flavorful, well executed, and are served in highly sharable portions.    DH does a great job of creating the classy dive bar experience - limited seating in a dark cave - highly conducive to meeting your neighbors and starting conversation.   Some of the items can get a little pricy considering the atmosphere - but Dick's does a good job of balancing out the menu with more affordable items too.  I  Two things:  1.  there is a good chance you will be sitting under an air condition vent or fan - so if you're not a fan of having air blown in your face or get cold easily - you might consider wearing a jacket.  2.  since the wood fired stove is part of the experience - you'll likely end up leaving with a distinct campground odor upon leaving the establishment - not always a bad thing - but something to keep in mind when deciding on where to grab drinks pre-opera.

This place gets a bump because it could easily pass for a set in a John Woo film and because there's just so much bad chinese food in the Phoenix.  Like a person that looks better by hanging around ugly friends, ACE benefits similarly.  Many reviewers call the place gritty.  I rather think it's more that the owners just don't give a damn about the dining room.  With food this flavorful and inexpensive, neither should you.  And as long as you don't, you'll be treated to some of the most flavorful and uniquely flavored Chinese food in the Valley.

I can't speak for everybody on staff, but my guy, Mike, is Picasso with the shears.  He is methodical and precise, and always knows how to interpret my failed attempts at describing what I want my hair to look like.  The guy is simply skilled.  It's a $20 haircut - which includes neck shave, shoulder massage, and face steaming.    I always leave here feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world - what more can you ask from your barber?

I want to like this place.  I really do.  It's near by, it's local, it's efficient, and it's reasonably priced and seems to be a holdover against the big chain burger guys.  It's just not that great.  While the fries were thicker cut - several were burned.  My burger's most prominent taste was charcoal, and I'm not talking about that delicious char grilled taste - I mean nasty petroleum tasting burned charcoal.  I may go back again, but with significantly lowered expectations.

I judge a soul food place by its fried chicken, a donut shop by its old fashioned, an ice cream place by its vanilla, and a Greek place by it's gyros.  The gyros here are bland and wholly unspectacular - and sourced from the same frozen food purveyor (Sysco?) as every other gyro stop in Phoenix.  The cloyingly thick pita didn't help either.  I don't know why it is so challenging to find a legitimate rotating spit gyro in this town - but it is.  Especially near downtown Phoenix.  Recommendations welcome.

Jiro (dreams of sushi) would not be pleased.   I went to lunch with a coworker for teppanyaki.  I should have known better - no one goes to a circus for a great meal.    Frozen mixed vegetable in the fried rice, old tasting shrimp, heavy handed sauces.  The same meal, minus the show, served in a Tokyo Joe/Samurai Sam bowl would cost 6.95 and be plated far more delicately and with greater attention to flavor.  Instead, I paid a little more than an Andrew Jackson (with tip) for a flavor fail in a dark and mostly empty room.  Food and ambiance aside, the show was spot on.  We had a Mexican teppanyaki chef who really was on his game (So much so, that I awarded Ichi Ban a star!)  Yes, it was much of the same old tired act teppanyaki chefs have been passing along to us for years (twirling spatulas, spinning eggs, onion volcanos, shrimp in the hat) but the passion this guy had for the show was undeniable. If only the ingredients and room matched his joie de vivre, I might have left Tolleson with a huge smile!    Ichi Ban = Shichi Ban.  Two stars.

This place is great.  The two slices and a coke for 4 bucks is a laughably cheap meal.  The pizza is New York style which is surprisingly hard to find in the Valley.  The trend here is far more nouveau rustico, brick oven style, a la Pizzeria Bianco.  It's hard to get a good slice.  It's not mind blowing pizza, but it's great in the niche it plays in, and certainly my go to option in the area.

I like simple places.  The downfall of many restaurants (IMHO) is attempting to do too much.  Rather than stick to what they can excel at, many owners try to extend themselves into arenas where they should not go.  This strategy is usually driven by incremental revenue or to appeal to new demographics.  What usually results is a culinary travesty that leaves everyone unsatisfied and ultimately another statistic in the world of failed businesses.  THMMB is not that sort of place, and I suspect, that it is the sort of joint that has real staying power.    The reason:  THMMB does one thing - burgers, and it does it with aplomb.  I get one thing when I come here - the green chili cheese burger combo for $5.  Good burger, good price point.  Nuff said.

I am not endorsing the entire chain with this review, but rather this store in particular.  Yelpers, this may be the best Cracker Barrel in Christendom.    I know, a lot of Yelpers out there are too hip for a chain as frumpy and junk filled as the CB - but I gotta tell you get past the giftshop and the TJ Mcgillicuddy like wall flare and there is something to latch onto here... the food is actually very good... assuming you stick to my golden rule of "The Barrel":  Stick to "country food" - that is, don't mess around with salads, baked fish, and the like.  The more country it sounds, the higher your chances of success.   Highlights:  Hashbrown Casserole Turnip Greens  Breakfast Country fried chicken (Sunday's only)

Jackpot!  Pizza a Metro is that rare joint that gets the basics down right - great food at an excellent value, paired with a charming interior (albeit tiny) and an owner who understands service and customer loyalty.   My only fear is that the place will change as more Phoenicians get wise to this gem.  Robert O. put it best, you'd have to be a stone cold douche to think that this place isn't [great].   \

Great selection of teas, but didn't seem all that knowledgable or helpful in selecting them.  I expected a little more from a place not competing on price or convenience.  The experience was pretty standard hippie meh.  I expect specialty stores to command subject expertise.  I thought it was a bit lacking.  I might go back but not in the near future.

There's good and bad here.  Though, I wouldn't live here - I would generally recommend it for people who are heavy sleepers, don't mind crappy service from staff, and don't have a car.  When I was an undergraduate I would have probably liked this place a lot.  It is walking distance to some fun stuff.   BUT...  Ben is right.  Spectacularly unhelpful management and leasing agents.  This will come to bite you at some point during your stay, and leave a terrible taste in your mouth.    Also, your living situation is a crapshoot as they show only the model apartment and do not show you the actual apartment you'll be moving into.  This complex is so huge and filled with so many different floor plans that there is a good possibility you'll get stuck with a crappy one and be either out of money or face an uphill struggle with the mgmt to get out.    Parking is a pain and cars have been towed... but there's always first Friday!

Papa Joe's makes catfish the way it should be made - non-fishy, non-greasy, with a perfectly seasoned and light crust.  Good greens, good mac 'n' cheese, great jalapeno hushpuppies.  If you want catfish - this is certainly the spot to be.  I also tried a bite of the pulled pork which I thought was passable (the vinegar based bbq sauce was, however, marvelous) but not anywhere in the same league as the catfish.

I always judge an ethnic restaurant by the percentage of patrons belonging to its particular ethnic group.  Pho Thanh fits the bill and is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.   Incredible assortment of Vietnamese food at amazing prices - with some house specialties you aren't going to find at your typical pho house...  IMHO, their Pho is 2nd rate, not bad, but certainly not the best.   Where they shine is their huge selection of other Vietnamese specialties - like Banh Mi Bo Kho - a delicious beef stew served with a french demi-baguette.  While their spring rolls are ok, their egg rolls are fantastic.

Still a huge fan, but having now compared it fully to Da Vang. I think DV's grilled pork (thit nung) is a little better.  Since its such a staple ingredient to so many dishes it's a difference maker to me.

Sure, it's in a very random strip mall.  Sure, it's got a genre bending name.    You're not there for an artisanal cocktail.  You're not there for a wood fired pizza.  You're definitely not there to see or be seen, or show off you're latest Prada sweater.    But, if you're on the East side and want to hide out and grab a stiff drink at a no-BS bar - this is a worthy joint indeed.  What makes it so are 2 things - interior character and an amazing sound stage for live music.  The latter fact alone should compel a visit - the stage is so good they could make a bad band sound professional - trust me!  So, shake off your pretense and catch a good local band - you won't regret it.

This place is a farce and a travesty...  as are all over priced banquet style Thai places that place a premium on marketability at the expense of food taste and quality.  It's the sort of place that fat English guys wanting to recreate their holiday in Pattaya or Koh Samui would go.   Again, I go back to my rule about ethnic restaurants - the less people of that ethnicity you see patronizing the place the less likely you are to get a great meal.    Although they do serve authentic Isan food on their menu - they recreate it unfaithfully and only in shades of what you really get in Thailand.  Isan, is a poorer, ethnic minority in Northeastern Thailand that is significantly influenced by Laos.  True Isan food is amazing - usually eaten with hand fulls of sticky rice - larb (ground meat, mint, and lime) , som tum (papaya salad), gai yang (grilled chicken), and sai krok isan (isan sausage).   Any restaurant claiming to be the standard bearer of Isan food, should serve these dishes with mastery.  Thai E-San does offer them, albeit at a ridiculous premium, but does so disappointingly.    It is sad to see such a great regional cuisine get such a terrible representative here in Phoenix.  Save your money and go elsewhere... unless you are an English tourist in need of nostalgia... in which case, proceed with my blessing!

Went on a Monday - and scored both a half priced ($2.50) beer and one of the best BLT's I've had in Phoenix - chocked full of crisp bacon, locally grown tomatoes - paired with a better than average mixed green salad.     You don't go to TMI to be wowwed by a splendid dinner - you go here to kick it with your pals in a cozy-swank environment with good beers and a cut-above average bar food.   The patio is awesome on a good weather night!

I went to a few neighborhood salons before finally choosing The Roose.  Now, I've only been here twice - but I have been very, very pleased on both occasions.  AJ, in addition to being a very talented stylist, is just plain easy to work with.  I've got a feeling this is going to be a hair-lationship.   The only thing bad about leaving a review here is that as the word gets out - it's going to be impossible to get an appointment!  I guess that's a small price to pay to get the word out about a really great stylist.

It's a proximate lunch spot for me, and I admit, that has something to do with why I like it so much.  But beyond that, they serve some really incredible fish tacos.  Also, they are super nice folks.

Consistently the best and most innovative flavors of any of the mighty Fro-Yo offerings.  Their plain base tart flavor is excellent and their flavors tend to taste very natural or very close approximations to their intended dessert (oatmeal cookie).    Nice staff, easy rewards program, clean, bright interiors.  A lot to like.

Pretty darn good breakfast.  Reasonably priced - generous portions, a notch above the fray.  The service was also very attentive, our coffee never saw empty.  As everyone has already attested, the pancakes here are prolific.  Crispy bits that could only be created on a really hot griddle, fried with what I imagine to be some deliciously heart clogging fat - like bacon grease or Crisco (unconfirmed).  The corn beef hash was also excellent.  I'd bring a friend.

I'm not a comic book nerd, but if I was, this place would be my joint.    While trying to find a catholic themed comic book for my godson's first communion, the managers were extremely helpful in tracking down the perfect gift (Customer service alone won me over).

So, I've been going here for a year and my guitars have never sounded better.   Donny gives great advice and is one guy that goes out of his way to help musicians - his philosophy and customer service are outstanding.  His collection of vintage amps are likewise impressive - plus the place is next to Nami!

Bagel man makes the best bagels in the Valley.  Hands down.  Crispy, chewy circular delights that make you question the existence of places like Einsteins.  His lox and egg breakfast sandwich is about the best meal 6$ can buy in the region.  If you know better, hit me up because I want to go to there.

Definitely the burger joint of choice in my hood.  Good people, good simple food with enough of a twist to differentiate - toasted bun, grilled onions, etc.  Keep up the work!   Nice prices, good value, clean place - the owners are really nice and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice (as it was today).  I will definitely come back again.

This is a tasty burger joint - toasted bun, secret sauce (1000 island), shredded lettuce - simple and delicious.  Thick French fries - low prices - clean environment - friendly staff.  Although they share a similar color scheme, this place puts Five Guys to shame.   Best in class for what it is.

So, yeah.  This place gets a bump.  I've eaten there a few times now and the food is consistently great.  The pastrami sandwich might be my favorite in town. The burgers are terrific.  All at an unbeatable price point.  GO.

So, it's not high brow sushi.  So what!  As an alternative to chipotle, 5 guys, rando sandwich shop - this place is a real winner.   Sure, it's designed for the American palette but with a sharp inviting interior, free wifi, and decent beer choices this place is a decent quick service alternative.  I'll be back.

I'm not sure how big the niche is for gourmet southern food while waiting for your car to be detailed, but apparently there is a large enough demographic to develop in one in North Scottsdale.    The best way to describe it would be to imagine a QT where every aspect of the traditional gas station/convenience store concept was redesigned by the shopkeepers at "La Grande Orange."     While I didn't have my car shined, I can attest that the southern-ish cafe inside serves up some of the tastiest southern food I've had in the Valley.  They absolutely nail their pulled pork, grits, bacon, eggs, etc - and good lord their Carolina BBQ sauce would fit right at home in Gastonia.  I'll be back with friends - and maybe a dirty car.

Overpriced, under delivered.  8-10 fried chicken wing parts and a 4oz cups of mac and cheese + bbq sauce laden cole slaw do not a platter make.  Not  terrible - not worth 12$

My band used to practice at Francisco Studios.  We used to leave every practice smelling like a Metallica roadie's jockstrap.  Perfect Timing has changed that.  Now when my band practices we walk into a clean well organized room with amps, drums and PAs laid out for us - we walk in, plug in our instruments, and go.  No more fussing, no more mess.  It's simply the best situation possible for a musician.

Here's the deal.  The food sounds special but it really isn't, and normally that would doom a place to me.  But... I keep coming back.  Why?  Because I don't come here to eat amazing food.  I come here to hang out in a casually stylish environment with good music and truly good coffee in a dedicated daytime establishment.  VVM definitely owns its slice of the restaurant ocean by sticking to a simple and stylish formula.

Love this place.  Great owners.  Delicious take on southern food.  Being from the South I take my biscuits and gravy seriously and these guys do not disappoint.  Their chicken is the truth.

After my initial experience here, the most immediate question in my mind is how well capitalized are their investors?  To the uninitiated Gadzooks appears to have been created to be as much a Chipotlé spinoff as possible.  From the hip, industrial design of the interior to the simplified menu options.  They've also borrowed Chipotlé's basic "build your own"  menu format.  Except rather than burritos - it's enchiladas... And as an afterthought soup.    While Chipotlé's menu is easy and intuitive, Gadzooks offers a 7 step choose your own adventure book accessed only by reading the most awkwardly placed chalkboard in restaurantdom.   The enchilada was bland.  The service seemed to be working awfully hard for so few guests.  The atmosphere was stylish but cramped.    I think these guys set out with a good idea, let's hope they have the capital to fix their fundamentals and get back on track.

I give this place two star because they should know better than to open a restaurant without having their ducks in a row.   This isn't a first time venture from a restaurant newbie, this is the third installment of rising culinary star, Kevin Binkley, and unfortunately Bink's has the appearance of a place trying to cash in on the celebrity of it's owner.  A well-pedigreed name gets me in the door, but after that, you've got to earn it.  Now, for the review:  Opening:  No one greeted me at the door, and when I walked in, I waited for a few minutes before anyone approached me.  Not a biggie, but you know - a better restaurant wouldn't let this slide.   The drinks: While my table was being readied, I sat at the bar and watched as the bar-tender angrily poured out a drink and complained about the server's mistake.  After waiting to be spoken to, the owner takes my order.  In the end I was served a well-attempted Hendricks martini, made to my preference.  But for the money - $13 - it was small and unspectacular.  The liquid nitrogen that my bartender heaped upon it - did nothing for the appeal.  The food:  the best area but highly uneven.  The foie gras beignets were tasty. The soup was delicious, the mussels so-so, the chop salad and french fries were highly salty but still good.  The cauliflower excellent.   Of all the elements  I experienced, the kitchen was the bright spot - and easily worthy of 3 stars.

This is the next best thing to being in Taiwan.  The food is remarkably authentic and delicious.  I usually get the fried pork cutlet meal which includes rice, some pickled vegetables, bok choy, and a hard boiled egg.   It reminds me of the little bento lunches you get at Taiwanese train or bus stations.

I think this "tavern" offers some excellent pub grub and beer selection.  I think their house burger when topped with Pub Cheese is sublime - and their charcuterie plate is an exceptional value - filled with lavash crackers, påte, two cheeses, salami, olives, and fig jam.   Tip:  The tickets print out without a space for a tip.  I am guessing they pay their servers a regular whole foods wage - and subtly discourage tipping.  So if you want to leave a gratuity - bring cash.

This place is a real interior design gem.  The interior features a fantastic design aesthetic centered around organic, natural, outdoor themes - with a subtle nod to Japan.  The indoor park benches surrounding large indoor ficus trees give the space a park-like feel.    Aside from being a great space, the curator/owners made really inspired plating and flatware choices that elevate the simple fare.    I couldn't help but enjoy my coffee mint julep in such an environment.  Publicus is a Latin pen name often used by anonymous civil disobeyers.  I applaud the curators and creators of this shop for doing something original and wonderful in downtown LV.

For those of you who aren't familiar, izakayas are more drinking establishments than restaurants.  Usually you and your buds drink sake or beer and eat a bunch of small snacks to accompany it.  The best snacks to me are items off of the grilled menu (yakitori) - usually chicken skewers.  When paired with an Asahi superdry, something magical happens.  Does this place serve world class yakitori?  No.  But the fact that there is a place in the Valley to scratch this culinary itch is easily worth 4 stars in my book.     My rec:  GO!  With coworkers or friends.  Order a japanese beer (preferably Asahi Super Dry).  Order off of the Yakitori menu - try at least one unusual meat - Beef Tongue is incredible.  Say "Kanpai!" a lot.  Drink more beer.

Finally!  A Thai restaurant that doesn't disappoint.  Curries and soups that feel more home made than restaurant.  They have kinks to work out - but the food is a much needed addition to downtown PHX.

This place is a gem!  And just what the neighborhood needed.  Pro-tip:  walk by the pastry/muffin/cold item counter towards the back of the restaurant before ordering your meal.. There are a ton of delicious items that get missed when you beeline for the counter
