I don't need to say anything. Just view my pictures. Filthy. Old. Disgusting.   I've stayed in Motel 6's nicer than this.

We had an outstanding stay here.  For the deal you get - being on the strip and across from Caesar's and Bellagio, you can't beat it.  It was incredibly convenient for us.  They've updated the rooms, so you didn't feel like you were stuck in a Holiday Inn circa 1970 once in your room.  And even though they've updated the rooms, they still have a little nostalgic Las Vegas flair with their court yard/garden/pool/flamingo zoo.  When I'm in Vegas on a budget, I guarantee you this is where I'll be staying again.

My new favorite spot in the greater Phoenix area. As a Northern California craft beer snob, I've been pretty disappointed in the craft beer offerings in Phoenix. Not anymore.   SBC's IPA (I think it's called Dank) could hold its own to any west coast IPA in Northern California or Oregon. Other hits were the Pale Ale (one of the best I've had), Uncle Rico's red and the Black IPA. All outstanding.   And the food is terrific. This place impressed me so much we came back for a second trip during my vacation, so we had a lot of the food. The fried pickles are thin and lightly fried - really good. The smoked/grilled chicken wings were delicious (they inspired me to try this at home). I had the fish and chips and pulled pork sandwich for my entres - both very good (the fries are awesome). And my gf had the grilled meatloaf (amazing!) and a chopped kale salad that she loved.   Great spot, clean, modern but comfortable, lots of TV's, nice staff. I look forward to coming back on my next business trip.
