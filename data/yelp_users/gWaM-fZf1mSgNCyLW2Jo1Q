We had a great time here! I have been to the Phoenix Zoo many times since moving here as it is a great activity when my friends and family fly into town. I'm also excited for the upcoming zoo lights which is always amazing!   The only downside here is the food. I expect the food to be way over price at places like this but the food here is not just over priced it's gross. Simple fix - don't eat here. Since I'm there for the animals and not the food it only cost them one star.   I will also say most of their concession stand are closed every time I have gone there. It would be nice to have soda or water easily available when getting thirsty instead of having to walk all the way back to the center of the zoo.   If you have AAA bring your card as you will get a discount on your tickets :-)

We came here for an office dinner. We had 20 people for dinner on a Friday night at 7pm.... the wait was 45 minutes which is far better than other places we have gone such as Dave and Busters (2 hour wait) and Bennihanas (1.5 hour wait)... the food was amazing, the waitstaff was efficient, accurate, and friendly. The best part was with the reasonable prices even with 20 adults we didn't have to break the bank. I would recommend this place to anyone. I love many items here but my favorite is the Italian stuffed grinder. (Or sub sandwich as I guess some people call it)... and a must have is their pizza cookie.  The only downside is their parking situation. Be prepared to park and walk since their actual parking lot fills up fast.

I love this place. Coming from the east coast finding a place with a great steak and cheese was important and this place fits the bill.  The food is always consistently good, the waitstaff has always been efficient and friendly and there are plenty of tv's for any game you want to watch. This place is a must go to bar.

This had to be the best hole in the wall in Phoenix. This quickly became our go to place when we are looking for a place to hang out after work. It's close to work, comfortable and the perfect noise level to enjoy the people we are with.    The prices are fantastic, especially at happy hour. The staff are typically very attentive and always have a great attitude. This place is the closest I have found to the small town bars where I am from. You won't regret coming here!

The food was delicious and cooked to perfection. Unfortunately it took a while to place our order and get our food. They were completely understaffed and while the girl was trying her hardest it was too much fit her to keep up with.

The restaurant has a fun old fashioned small town diner feel to it. Walking in we were instantly hungry because the whole place smelled of BBQ....the prices were reasonable and the service was on point.   A friend traveling from out of town suggested we go here because they were featured on diners, drive in's and dives... we already had a favorite BBQ place but figured why not. I'm glad he did! This place was wonderful. I got the pulled pork while my husband ordered the full rack of ribs. Our friend ended up ordering the briquette.... we all loved our meals especially the beer battered fries.  The BBQ sauce had a sweet tangy flavor to it that went really well with the pulled pork. The corn bread however did leave a little something to be desired. We will absolutely be back.

This place is so cute. It has a great atmosphere and they had a musician singing outside taking requests.   I absolutely loved the ambiance. I ordered Fettuccini Alfredo which was really good.  I had the "Italian Dream" to drink from their speciality cocktails and it was amazing!   The prices were very decent and the food was great. I would have rated five stars but my waitress was terrible, barely checking in and she forgot my second drink. Then when I said never mind she seemed annoyed with me.

My husband and I came here because we were missing the seafood back home. We knew it wouldn't be as fresh as Maine since it does have to be frozen for travel, but this was awful. The food actively smelled rancid and tasted rotten. I couldn't even eat part of my meal. My husband who will eat pretty much anything only ate about a quarter of his meal. The only reason they get two stars is because the waitstaff was very nice and professional.

My husband and I celebrated our 10 year wedding anniversary here. We had reservations for 6 pm and they had us seated right on time.   The staff were fantastic and really attentive. They went out of their way to make our night special. They decorated our table with anniversary confetti, congratulated us on our anniversary at every chance, and gave us both complimentary desserts with happy 10th anniversary written in chocolate on the plates.   The food was amazing. I don't think I've ever had calamari so good! My steak was cooked to perfection and my husband's lobster was just as fresh as when he gets it off the dock in Maine.   It is pricey but worth every penny.

The restaurant is always clean and the service is fast. I have found the employees there to be very pleasant. Clearly they must like working there because they all seem to have the most genuine smiles.   For fast food I would say it's great. Whenever we want something quick we come here because it doesn't taste like we are eating fast food.   The parking situation is good.  No matter what time of day there always seems to be a place to park.   I would definitely recommend this location and this restaurant to anyone.

The food was very well prepared and the staff were very nice. The woman working Gabe me the choice between the last little left over bits of chow mein or waiting a few minutes for the new batch to finish which I was very grateful for.   The restaurant was clean and service was definitely prompt.   The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because the parking situation is a nightmare. I spent more time trying to get out of the parking lot than I did actually getting and paying for my food, including waiting begins the very large line ahead of me on the restaurant. Because of this I will unfortunately never come back to this location.

Upon arrival the valet was nice and check-in went smooth. The room was nice and clean. I wasn't able to connect to the wi-fi and when I called they offered to connect me to tech support. I didn't want to waste my time here on the phone so I just let it go.   We had dinner at the Italian restaurant which was amazing then we headed up to the top to view the city. Sitting up there looking out over the city lights having some drinks was magical.   We did a little gambling in the casino then retired back to the room. The casino was nice and the drinks kept coming.   My only real complaint comes the next day. We called down to ask for a bell hop.  The guy that came to our room  kept walking fast ahead of us not seeming to care he was leaving us in the dust.  Then when outside waiting for the valet he seemed annoyed to be there. Another customer asked for his help and he just flat out ignored her so I helped her instead.   The valet that brought our car however was very helpful and cheerful. I would definitely stay here again.

The food was very good but a little overpriced for what you get. The wait staff was very attentive and polite. The only thing is when I arrived there were plenty of takes but they wouldn't seat me until my entire party arrived. I understand that if they are busy but if they are empty they should not make you wait to be seated.

My husband bought me $400 in gift certificates to Red Door Spa between my birthday and our 10 year wedding anniversary.  I've been holding those gift certificates since the beginning of the year.  I kept putting off making an appointment because the only location I was aware of was in the Biltmore and it's hard to find time to make it there.    Finally, being on vacation this week and knowing I was not going anywhere I decided to make an appointment.  When I googled it to get the phone number I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there was a Red Door Spa just down the road from me!  (If I realized that I would have made my appointments months ago!)  When I called to make my appointments the girl on the phone was very helpful and informative, making sure to advise me of the amenities that I would be able to use while here for the day.  I am thankful she did because I was able to come prepared with my kindle and bathing suit.  I booked an 80 minute hot stone massage, a Signature Facial, an eyebrow wax, and a signature pedicure.   When I showed up for my appointments the girl at check in was very nice, although once I was checked in she said I could head back and started to assist another customer.  When I asked her where "back was" she was quick to apologize and asked if this was my first time there. I said yes and she told me to take a seat and a very sweet woman came out to get me.  She gave me a tour of the facilities and explained everything to me.    Once the tour was completed she took me to the tranquility area to wait for the masseuse.  The masseuse, Sarina, was sweet and professional.  She did a great job with the massage, although I wish more attention had been paid to my hands as I had indicated that my left hand was a problem area since I work on a computer all day.  Overall though the massage was extremely relaxing and I almost fell asleep several times.  I have had many massages over the years at many different spa's across the country.  Sarina ranks right at the top.  She used the appropriate amount of pressure, not too soft but not too hard.  The aromatherapy enhancement was nice, although next time I would probably skip it and save the $20.    Next onto the facial/eyebrow waxing.  The esthetician, Monika, was very knowledgeable and professional.  The facial was so refreshing and the head/neck/arm/hand massage was amazing.  Again I wanted to fall asleep!  She also did an amazing job shaping my eyebrows during the wax.  This was only my second facial in my life, so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I really enjoyed it and will definitely be coming back for another one!  Once I was done with Monika she brought me to Cindy who took care of me during my pedicure.  I get pedicures like clockwork every 5-6 weeks.  Usually I go to those walk in shops, although I have had several at spa's as well.  This was easily in the top 3 best pedicures I have ever had.  She put great effort into my massage, again almost putting me to sleep.  She was very aware throughout the pedicure and attentive.  The neck pillow smelling of cinnamon and clove was a nice touch and again they almost put me to sleep!  Once all of my services were completed I went to the ladies dressing area and out to the private patio up back.  I laid out reading my kindle for a while, then got into the hot tub where I relaxed doing some more reading.  Once I was done in the hot tub I went to the sauna and relaxed for a bit more before using their showers to freshen up.    This was a very relaxing day.  If you are looking to get pampered and spend a day on yourself this is the place to be.  I went straight home and let my husband know that more gift certificates here would be a definite win!    An important note: Getting to their private parking area is a bit confusing.  If you don't want to park on the street, pull into the Wigwam resort entrance and make an immediate left following the little windy road all the way to the spa.  (You can't miss the spa once you come up on it.)  This is the only way to get to the spa parking.  I drove around for a while before finding the entrance to the spa road.

The service was not the most prompt and we waited for quite some time for our drinks and food. That being said we came here the night of Glendale glitters so in fairness they were packed. It may have been a fluke. The beers were fantastic and the perfect temperature and the food was very good and extremely authentic. We definitely will go back, maybe during a less busy time.

I love this theater.  First, let me just say, the 21+ theater - BRILLIANT.  I love that I can go to the movies, sit in a recliner, order booze and food delivered directly to me, AND I don't have to deal with screaming children????  (Don't worry - those of you with children they separate the theater into two sides, one for all ages and one for 21+.)  The food is good, not great, but definitely good.  If the food quality was just a bit better I would have rated this place 5 stars.  The set up is fantastic, I can actually see the screen from any seat no matter who sits in front of me and my husband (who is 6'1") no longer has to slouch in his seat out of fear he is blocking the person behind him.  My suggestion, buy the $12 stubs rewards card.  It's worth it.  You avoid the internet ticket purchasing fees, plus earn rewards towards free credits.

This place was fantastic. My husband and I are staying here and on a whim decided to get massages. The staff was very friendly helping us book our massages. Once in the spa the hot tub was great and the staff were friendly. I have been to many spa's across the country and this rated right up there. My husband had never had a massage before and they took their time explaining everything. My only wish was that they should have a room for couples massages. I would have liked to have been in the same room as my husband.

We came here based on the yelp reviews. The restaurant was clean, and the staff were very nice. There was nothing really remarkable one way or the other regarding the restaurant decor and set up.   We ordered a cheese steak, cheese dog, and fries. The fries appeared to be frys brand crinkle cut frozen fries or something similar.  The dog had nacho cheese on it which was fine, but the dog itself had an odd flavor.  As for the steak and cheese there was not anything special about it. Based on the reviews I expected it would be great. Coming from back east and hearing that the cheeses steaks were similar I was excited.... unfortunately they don't hold a candle to the cheese steaks back east.... Overall the food did the job of ending our hunger, however I would not say we really felt satisfied. It was not bad, not good, just ok.  Some of the reviews mentioned the place is under new management so perhaps the food is not the same food as when the positive reviews came in? Either way I do not see us returning.  What a disappointment.

My husband woke me up at 5am this morning asking me to take him to the hospital because he tried to drive to work and felt like he was going to pass out. My husband never calls out of work and usually fights me tooth and nail about going to the doctor so I was really worried.   The hospital is nice on appearance and the check in process was easy. I was surprised they didn't take our insurance info until after admitting him and running a bunch of tests. That shows me they care more about their patients than they care about money. Seems as though their priorities are set right.   The staff were all very kind and light hearted which helped keep the mood calm. After running all of the necessary tests they kept him for monitoring until they felt comfortable releasing him. They gave clear instructions about following up with our doctor to get him on blood pressure meds.   Overall this was a very good experience.

I don't know what they have against seating me in the dining room but every time I come here they seat me in the bar. Don't get me wrong I definitely enjoy a good drink but the bar tends to be louder with less privacy. I go to restaurants to have good food and enjoy the company of the people I am with... not to hang out in a bar. That being said the food is amazing so I rated them four stars because of their food.

My husband and I came here to see Weird Al.  We didn't stay in the hotel as we got a much better deal at Excalibur but we did do some gambling and drinking here.    The casino itself was clean and the wait staff were on it. I don't think we waited more than a minute or two for someone to come ask our drink order. Perhaps though they are so good about keeping you liquored up so you don't notice how quick your money disappears. Their slots were the worst on the strip for payout.    Their concert venue is set up nice and the staff was very kind. I bought a double rum and coke (ok a few of them lol) but I would say it was more of a triple. They were certainly not afraid to be generous with their booze.  I would definitely come to another show here.

I came here with my husband and two of our friends. Checking in was really easy and the staff was very kind and helpful. My friend and I went to buy some drinks before heading out with our husbands and we were happy with the service and the fact that they packed them in ice for us.   On the course itself the green was in great shape and they had recently seeded. Overall with the prices they charge this was a steal. We highly recommend this course!

The food here is amazing every time!  I have been here many times and have never been disappointed. If you are looking for good authentic BBQ this is the place to go. I love their BBQ sauce, especially the hot and spicy!    The service is always on point here and they all have a great attitude.   I love this place. I always get the country fried chicken sandwich. The rib appetizer is also a must try!

This is the perfect place to watch some football, enjoy some great food, and have a few beers.  Add in their reasonable prices and you have the recipe for a great time.   With the beer options here you can't help but order at least one. The food is fantastic. Personally I love the lunch salad and sandwich special. I get a half Turkey club and the best Cesar salad I have ever had anywhere. They also have an option for soup too... however I can't every seem to turn my back in that Cesar salad lol.   The wait staff are always pleasant and usually on point. I did have one waitress when I was there about a month ago who was very disinterested and because of that she messed up our order.   They have many tv's up around the place and on Sundays they have several different football games showing.   The only downside is twice we have had to wait to be seated even though there were clearly tables available.   Overall I give four stars because even having to unnecessarily wait, the food is always worth it because the food is THAT good.

If you are looking for a fun and scary Halloween attraction, Fear Farm on 99th ave and McDowell is well worth the price of admission. (28.99 + tax on the weekends.) My friend and I had a blast!   We were initially worried when we saw the size of the lines, but they moved fast and it was actually nice having a little break between attractions.  We went on a Saturday night and we were easily able to get through all of the attractions even though we didn't get there until 9:30 at night.   I had seen some reviews of people complaining about there being too many teenagers, but honestly the teens were respectful and didn't seem to be a problem.  Plus there was a police presence along with a ton of staff. The entire event is really well organized.   The haunted houses were really well put together and the people working there did a great job selling it.  Several of the haunted houses are integrated with the massive corn field which was even more freaky.  Of all the haunted houses the only thing I encountered I wasn't fond off was this one small section that you had to go through a three foot tall tunnel so you could either crawl or scooch down which is really not comfortable. I heard quite a few people complaining as we were going through it.  But it was not very long so it wasn't enough to make me rate this place lower.   The only real down side is now my throat hurts from screaming so much... well....that and after leaving I was so paranoid about something jumping out at me that my cat jumped the shit out of me after I got home.... I'm glad my husband got home shortly after so I could stop being so paranoid lol

I have been intending to come here for some time but until tonight it hadn't worked out.... tonight however I came here with some friends and was not disappointed. The ambiance is great and the staff were on point. The waiter did not write down our order which honestly does not impress me. What impresses me is getting my order right. Luckily he got our food right, but I do worry if that is their policy that future visits I may not be so lucky. The waiter was very attentive and had a great attitude. The food was amazing. I ordered the chicken club and absolutely loved it. One of my friends ordered the Mac and cheese which was equally amazing and a huge portion. Pricing was fairly decent as well running about 15 per person for the meals. I will definitely be returning.

I go to this location every day, multiple times a day on the weekends.  Coming from Maine, my Dunkin is important to me.  It can make or break my day.  In the last 14 months since I moved near this location they have only made a mistake on my coffee 3 times.  That puts them at a greater than 99% success rate!!!    The staff are courteous and when I come through they pay attention to the small details.  For example, I ask for a large straw when I order a medium iced coffee.  After three times asking at this location I didn't have to ask again, excluding of course a couple times when someone new had started.  It may not seem like a big deal to you, but to me I will always be won over with the small details.  It shows that the staff cares.  Plus, with the Dunkin' app and the coffee cards I earn so many free coffees!!!  Oh yeah, and every time the cardinals win I get a free coffee too!  I've never really been a football fan (I'm a baseball girl) but I find myself rooting for the Cardinals every week!!!  The only reason I am rating this location four stars instead of five is due to the wait time every morning at the drive thru.  I would like to see improvement in the speed of service during the busy times of the day.

Don't ever go here.  They viciously attacked a friend of mine all over a dispute of the $10 minimum charge.  My friend had already paid the $10 minimum because everyone was planning on leaving so he cashed out.  When deciding to stay, he ordered one final beer.  When going to cash out they went to charge an additional $10.  My friend told them he had already paid the $10 charge a little bit before.  The bartender became defensive and asked if my friend was "trying to tell him how to run his bar".  My friend said No, but that he would dispute it with his credit card company if they charged another $10.  At this point the bartender punched my friend out of nowhere while his bouncer friends jumped on top of him, punching him, choking him, and kicking him in the ribs.  DO NOT GO HERE!!!

I came here on a business dinner and fell in love.  The décor was tasteful and the set up flows nicely.  The food was amazing (You must get the Kale Caesar Salad!)  and the waitstaff were extremely attentive.  I was drinking iced tea and not only did they refill it every time I got to the half way mark, they even brought me extra ice for the table in case I wanted to add more!    The only downside, when we were there they had a large party (I'd say probably around 15-20 people) and we were seated near them.  Because of this it was pretty loud and at times hard to hear the people we were with.  That being said, I think if there wasn't such a large party it would have been average noise levels, so I may update my rating after I go back..... and with the food they serve I will be going back!!!

We order takeout from here regularly. They have an easy to use online ordering system. As for the food we have enjoyed everything we have gotten here. I highly recommend the calamari.  You will not be disappointed with what you order.   Pickup is easy, just needing to park in the takeout spot and they will bring the food to you. The downside is that they always take longer than they say and we have to make sure to double check our order since they have forgotten items we have ordered on three occasions.

This has quickly become one of my favorite places.  We often have business acquaintances in town and this is our favorite place to bring them.  It's fun, great environment, phenomenal food, and a fantastic price.  Add in free valet and this is the place to go!!!

The place was fairly busy when I walked in this past Saturday but someone was assisting me within minutes. I had just bought my first Vape and had a lot of questions. The staff was quick to help and had a great attitude. One girl in particular - I wish I could remember her name but she was younger (well younger than me lol) and fairly slim - was extremely helpful.   She was extremely knowledgeable and was extremely patient with me while I tried many flavors. I had ordered my vape online and the juice was to harsh for me. She was able to steer me in the right direction and I settled on honey dew for one of my flavors and vanilla for the other.   Their stuff was slightly more expensive than online but based on quality it was worth the extra couple of dollars.   I will most definitely be back here!

The food and service were amazing. The wait for a table was crazy long and the only complaint I had is that we called ahead of time when we were on our way to get on the list and the girl that answered refused to put us on the list over the phone. Otherwise great experience.

This place was awful.  I almost gave two stars because my husbands lobster was good, being from Maine it was not great, but he said it was good.  The reason I could not bring myself to give two stars is because my chicken was served undercooked, which could kill someone.  I understand this is a seafood establishment and chicken is not their specialty, but serving raw chicken is unforgivable.  Do not go here.
