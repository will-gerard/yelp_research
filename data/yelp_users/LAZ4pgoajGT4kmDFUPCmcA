I'm in love with Postino.  I do love the outdoor seating area, open air restaurant, wait staff, food, drinks - everything.    I have been coming here for well over 4 years and recently branched out from my usual picks.  I tried the Mediterranean salad and Veggie panini- both great choices!    If you are looking for GREAT wine, AMAZING bruschetta, and a relaxing evening out, Postino is the place!  I've never been disappointed.

This place has amazing food and I always get the Chloe's favorite! I would rate this place a 5 stars if it wasn't for the poor customer service at the registers. There seems to always be the same gal up front who never smiles and is reluctant to answer any questions regarding the menu. I hate to downgrade from a 5-4; owner is extremely nice and is always there to help and my experience great.

I love Postino Winecafe!  Although the central location is closest to me, I do love the atmosphere and outdoor seating that the 40th st/Campbell location offers.  If you are looking for GREAT wine, AMAZING bruschetta, and a relaxing evening out, Postino is the place!

Oh, Duza's...how I wanted to love you! First time here- love tuck shop so I hoped it would be a similar experience. Great atmosphere and food is AMAZING, but not a place for a quick meal whatsoever. Our 15 minute wait to order turned into 35 minutes...and we still hadn't ordered! Once ordering, we waited an additional 20 minutes for our food.  Great if you have a few hours to kill, but overall service is bad. Friendly staff but slow and obviously overwhelmed.
