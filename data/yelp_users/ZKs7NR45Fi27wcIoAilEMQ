this was my first visit &  I will NEVER go back  I will NEVER go back I will NEVER go back I will NEVER go back I will NEVER go back I will NEVER go back kicking, dragging, screaming I will NEVER go back  ordered fish & chips, shepherd's pie & steak 'n kidney pie & beers fish & chips = blah, nothing special or memorable, just plain cheap cod that was NOT cheap in $ shepherd's pie = this was not shepherd's pie it was cottage pie and it was bland, tasteless, boring! steak 'n kidney pie = where was the kidney? (chips = blah)  If you have nothing to compare 'traditional British' food to, then you may consider it good, (except for the bland COTTAGE Pie)!!!    Only reason they got two stars is that the bartender/service wasn't awfully terrible.  I ask one question; do 'you' pay more attention to 'your' regulars?  OR, do 'you' pay more attention to the newbies so they want to be regulars?  oh, & $5/beer....?  & it's dirty, all the decor...cause it's never been cleaned/dusted since 1995.

YAY for another adventure to Coup des Tartes!!!    Prior to arriving I mulled & mulled & mulled over the menu & when we got there, it was different, no worries, because indecisive me was able to...BAM!...decide!!! Woo!  As always the service is absolutely fabulously supreme!  Ordered chevre/tomate (it's becoming a staple along with onion tarte), I ordered salmon & the opposite ordered pork tenderloin.  My salmon was good & the sides were DELICIOUS (not the same as the online menu) BUT, why is it that for me, the opposite plate of food always tastes better?

I'll never visit a Ruth's Chris again!  Went here for a boyf bday then Morton's for the bro's bday, no no don't be silly not all in one night!  Everything about Morton's was better, the food, the service, the atmosphere, ESPECIALLY the atmosphere!  And, the price tag at Ruth's Chris, so not worth it!  Buy yourself some organic grass-fed beef and grill it yourself, I'm telling you, totally way better!!!

Breakfast at noon = AWESOME!!!  EVEN MORE AWESOME?  Front flipping row parking, ha!!!    Had the Daybreaker - egg white omelet with roasted turkey breast, topped w/ tomato-avocado salsa!  Absolutely fantastically wonderfully DELICIOUS!!!  It was light & flavorful & quite a bit of turkey, good turkey, not the pressed processed stuff claiming to be turkey :-)  Love their ice tea, mmm mmmm mm!!!

The epitome of dive bar!!!   I have never been here and not had a good time!   The bartenders are awesome, the drinks are strong, the food is delicious and you'll end your night with a shockingly cheap tab!

Love the pedicures I leave this place with!  Everyone else fails miserably and charges too much for their outcomes!  Fancy Nails is a good deal with a great result!  I've gotten a manicure once which was decent!    Me footsies love Fancy Nails!!!

Went specifically for the Roast Beef & Gorgonzola sandwich.  Still fresh in my memory, I refused to share and wanted my own, "I want it and I want it NOW!"  It really is a delicious & rich sandwich!  My recommendation; ask for it on a different roll/bread OR keep it on the sourdough and make your own "dipped" sandwich!!!

I'll go back AND get the same dish!  Now, that's some serious business for me to say!   Ordered the following: Keema Samosa - eh....  I just have such specific fond memories of the samoosa's we'd get back home and I doubt I will ever find anywhere that will match them -too bad so sad-  :-( Lamb Curry - lamb was delicate & sauce was just a touch spicy, delish! Chicken Korma - chicken was so tender, very flavorful. Alu Paratha (bread) - this was just okay to me, but it was great when I doused it with the sauces :-D  I thoroughly enjoyed it, everything was very flavorful and the smell of spices when you walk into the restaurant, OMG, so wonderful!!! Do I think it's super authentic, no, if that's what you're looking for, keep hunting...

I had never visited this little dwelling, but I can assure you I will re-visit!  Coach House is the epitome of dive, and I enjoyed it!!!    Seriously cheap drinks.  I think it was $8 for two Ketel cocktails...  Coach House was exactly what my confidence needed after having walked fashion square & dealing with the up & downs...

A friend & I went to try THE best pizza in the world...  It was really good.  It's the crust!!!  I think we waited 3 hours but it was kinda enjoyable drinking wine having lot's of girly chat...   BUT, then I went back a second time with the boyf and it was okay.  It wasn't as good as I remembered it...  (Maybe we thought it was good because we were full of wine...?)   The first time I was there, we got seated just after 9pm and then 2 separate couples showed up at 9.30 & 9.45 and were seated right away.  Soooooooo, I think to myself, well that's the trick, show up close to closing time and bam you're seated!!!  So, that's what the boyf & I did & we were seated right away, but then the pizza didn't end up being as good as the first visit...  Maybe my trick wasn't so useful after all, bah!!!

OMG OMG OMG!!! Have loved everything I have ever tried!   The kobe meatballs, lobster escabeche, all the empanadas, shrimp chicharron, kobe beef flatbread, caipirinha.  Those are my staples that I get EVERYTIME I go!   I always sit in the bar with bartender Chris from MI, he is absolutely fabulous!!!  And, the drinks he makes always turn out phenomenal!  I insist he makes my drinks whilst there!!!

I was not all that impressed with dinner.  For me it's a more enjoyable spot for happy hour, drinks & a few appetizers.  The White Peach & Hibiscus margarita is absolutely delicious.  Go during happy hour, get 50% off, then you won't feel like it was such a waste/rip-off!

I've been to this theatre a fair share, but this time I went for the UFC 111 Georges St. Pierre vs. Dan Hardy.  Who knew one could watch UFC at the friggin movie theatre?!?!  They also show boxing fights.  At first, I was SO hesitant, I even walked back from DSW to ask if I could get my money back if I decided against going.  Yes, as long as it's before the fight.  It was $20, yeah kind of steep, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and I will go back when it's a big anticipated fight with a fighter I like.  But, come on, Georges fighting on a large screen!?!?!

I've been dreaming about Saigon Nites ever since I went there some weeks ago.  hmm, what do you feel like?  Saigon Nites I chime!    We shared fried shrimp wontons, they were 'eh', I probably wouldn't get them again. Shrimp Pho, simple and mild, yet tasty! Saigon Nites Walnut Shrimp, OMG!  I thoroughly enjoyed this.  It's a little...different.  It's pretty sweet, so sharing is a good idea.  Mmmmm, YUM!!!

MY EXPERIENCE: We take a seat at a table in the corner.  It wasn't set so a busser brings our water & utensils, she is carrying the end of the utensils we're about to put in our mouth.  There is hair in my water.  Dude takes the water away saying yeah, that's gross (he didn't apologise).  My hash brown layer concoction was awful.  Felt like I was eating plastic, tasted like it too, eggs were rubbery & only two small strips of bacon.  My companions chicken fried steak wasn't bad, though they forgot to bring his side of corn beef hash, proceed to bring him hash browns and then the corn beef hash...  He was done with his food before they brought either of them out!  The gentleman in the back putting butter in the pans wasn't wearing gloves (the other cooks were) and picks up a piece of butter he dropped, yip, with his hands.  Our server sits at the bar near us & inhales his food, quite a sight!  No one asked how our meal was.  He brings us our check, my full plate of food is sitting right there, still doesn't ask us about our meal.  We ask for a to go box, my companion looks inside and it's got an oil puddle and oops, some MORE hair!!!  We pay and run out of there!  I personally am too afraid of going back there in the fear of I might 'catch' something but then again maybe it was a combination of my bad luck and a bad day for them...?

Shrimp & Serrano pizza, droooool!  I just love it! Went for happy hour and had the shrimp pizza, a shrimp cocktail and a sauvignon blanc that I really enjoyed, and of course, no, I did not make note of it :-(  They've lowered their prices and they are definitely worth going over for dinner or happy hour or lunch :-)  Initially, the service started out really strong.  She was new, but was trying and was very friendly!  But, towards the end, we waited and had to ask for our check...  Time for dinner!!!!

Save yourself, DO NOT go here!  See AMber W. - place is empty, you provide a service that results in tips, it's a recession, be lucky you have a job, how 'bout you be a little nicer?!?!?   Her review was almost a year ago, well they haven't changed!    This is the third time I've been here and each time it's worse!    My boyf enjoys the herb crusted burger, it's not bad.  But, to have to put up with sourpuss jerks, NOPE, not fabulous enough!!!  I had a burger, nothing to write home about...  And, along with very dismal depressing servers & bartenders, it stinks like a night after a chorus of Englishmen singing rugby songs till morn were there (it stinks every time we've been there), and the wonky unstable chairs, and the not so great pricing, please find a reason why you should hurt yourself by going to this awful dwelling!  This is a review from three separate spaced apart visits, one lunch, one an event, one dinner, I've earned the right to give this place negative stars, dammit, I can't...!  Oh, and by the way, the tots are NOT good x 3!!!

hmm Indian food sounds good tonight, well I am in luck, Indian Paradise is but a mere hop skip & a jump jump, so off we go. Ordered vegetable samoosa's, Rogan Josh and Shahi Kofta Curry.  Both were lamb dishes and both were very good.  I will certainly venture back and look forward to going for lunch!  Our service was just outstanding, absolutely superior, tops!!!  You just can't beat a staff who perform their duties whilst expressing such happiness!  Right!?!  And above all else, they play cricket on their TV!  When I found this out, it was a done deal for me, YAY!!!  AND, the food is good, life is pleasant :-)

My experience was lame :-/  I had the dayton caesar, I know, boring...  Though apparently it is possible to screw up.  The chicken was dry and tasteless and the rest was, well, lettuce...  Reading everyone else's reviews, I will give it another go and be more adventurous with the selection :-)

I've had the same pizza every time now.  My eyes and belly just love it so! It's the Pizza Blanca and I get it with roma tomatoes and extra mozzarella!    AND, the people working there are just flipping fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    While we were waiting, I noticed two employees tucked away taking 'food tests'.  I appreciate that!    I've been to the one off Camelback & 20th St. and they're a little undesirable... Ima keep coming back to this exact location :-)

They serve beer (actually a full bar now)!!!   This time I got a crunchy carnitas taco and a blackened chicken taco, SO good!  The carnitas is very flavourful, tender and the blackened chicken has a little spice. When we were leaving we saw a couples order; Carne Asada and Chorizo nachos, they looked phenomenal and they said they get them all the time!!!  ¡HAPPY HOUR! $2 Mexican Cervezas and $3.99 Margaritas 3 pm - 7 pm Monday through Friday  http://habaneros.mx/

For me finding a good stylist that suits my hair is tough!  I seriously have to build up the courage to go and then I never go back.    Well, I went to see Lori after a recommendation from a trusty source.  And, man oh man, I am glad I went!  I walked out with bangs, never had them before, but Lori did a great job.  Her cut is $50 and she does the cut wet & dry, which I love!  AND, she is adorable!!!  I will be visiting Lori again for future cuts :-)

First time - I'll go back! Price - actually, not that bad.  Where can you go in N. Scottsdale and find something for less than $10, specifically for lunch? Portion - definitely decent!!!  I ordered the lunches online and there were substitutions, which they took no note of, but the gal was very sweet and brought the correct salad to my office.  Try going around the corner to Fox Sport's Grill, where you'll pay $14 for a salad and definitely less than 1/10 as good as Tossed...

OMG, I can't WAIT to go back again...NOT!!!  The food was not memorable, the service was not attentive AND on top of it the seating is ridiculous close, I could of reached over and shared his food!  BUT, for some reason Sam is opening a second True Food at Scottsdale Quarter...!?   Me thinks, wait for that one and give it a try again...

This place is the shizznit (on Sundays)!!!  I have been going every Sunday recently and always have a great time! The cocktails are fun and tasty and 20% off on Sundays...! On Sundays they have DJ's mixing some awesome chilled deep house beats which is always a treat.  Monday mornings just don't agree with me at all...

I really really really enjoy Humble Pie.  Tried every pizza on the menu and the only one that I didn't like was the little neck clam, but that's just personal preference...  The pistachio is a 'dry' pizza, different but good!  And, when they do their half price pizzas, my eyes always become larger than my stomach but I'm left with days of leftovers YUM!!!  My most most most absolute favorite is the Prosciutto & Pear, profoundly delicious to me!!!

I am in-love!  After my first visit, I just wanted yogurt for every meal!!!  The oatmeal cookie & red velvet are SO freaking delicious!  They are pretty rich so add some vanilla to tone it down.  I ended up trying every flavor, not a good idea as I'm terribly indecisive -it's a curse!  The chick doing the samples was super funny & sweet.  She kept making me try different combinations, SO ridiculously yummy!!!  I love love love the Tarte Nouveau.  Unfortunately my bf was not all that impressed :-( But, I love it so :-p And, I think it's way better than Mojo!

This is the WORST dwelling I have ever set foot in!  A complete bunch of idiots serving behind the bar.   We ordered the same drinks five separate times and each and every single time the price was different.  So, I ask the one chick bartender, who thought she was on a fashion show runway, what's the price again?  I tell her that everytime we've ordered it's been a different price, she shrugs her shoulders and fluffs up her hair, looks at me, shrugs her shoulders with even MORE emphasis and throws her arms up in the air....and fluffs her hair again!  Then there was the other guy that held onto my debit card for about 15minutes.  He had NOOOOOO idea what he was doing.  He couldn't even give me a chilled shot of vodka, he had to ask the other guy to do it....  The first round of drinks seemed pretty normal for Scottsdale, but they just got more and more expensive.  They must have looked around the place at how empty and slow it was....?  Or, maybe they work off of commission on drink sales...?  And, above all else, the atmosphere totally blew.  Myself and four others did not have fun.  We all left after being there a very short time!

I am going back! I am going back! I am going back!  The food was SOOOOOOOOO outstanding that the blah service did not even matter.  I think our server maybe got family bad news because he was just NOT hopping or happy.  Whilst the bartender was VERY iron chef like, "so this dish is blah blah & it is lightly coated blah and flash fried and and and and", he was AWESOME!  Seriously made us think the patron was a food critic the way this guy was performing!  And, the immensely obese 90 year old couple next to us was quite appetizing too!  It is definitely an older crowd, go later, when they're already in bed :-)  Regardless, we WILL go back and thoroughly look forward to it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A friend and I went for a glass of wine and to take a look.  Pretty awesome selection as far as the grocery side, a pretty penny too!   We had wine & a cheese board made up of our own selections!  Too many options for an indecisive pair, but oh so fun!  The outcome was absolutely fabulous!!!  And, a glass of wine for $5, brilliant!!!   Heard the sandwiches are pretty delicious!!!   I'll certainly go back for more :-)

I just have to say, this Fascinations is awesome!!!  In comparison to other Fascinations & Castle Boutique, this deserves to be in N. Scottsdale (haha)   ;-) VERY clean, tidy, non-offensive & the gals working there didn't give me the heebeejeebee's!  Nor did any of the other customers that came in! Also, all the expensive higher end 'products' weren't locked up behind glass cases so you could actually look with your hands & not JUST your eyes, now isn't that fun!?!  I hope it get's enough business so it will stay, because if I move, I will drive to this location over any others!

HTC is tops!!!    Got an anchor done by Marilyn.  She did a beautiful job!  It was super quick and painless.    Two weeks later I went back because I was being a little paranoid.  I spoke with Jon this time and he was super amazing!  And, then there is also Anthony who is very kind, informative and pleasant!!!  And, yes I was just being paranoid...  But, both Jon and Anthony made me feel a million times better :-)  They have all been superb to deal with and I can't wait to go back for some more additions.    I will NOT go anywhere else!  You will be in very safe and educated hands!!!

Chicago's #1 Italian Beef since 1938 (in the old Prickly Pear).  It was actually quite yummy!  Just make sure you order your sandwich wet or dipped, do NOT go plain!  And, don't forget the sweet peppers (loved 'em) or the hot giardiniera.  Also, don't waste your time on Little Al!   The sandwich was really good, it wasn't too heavy or greasy.  Though, the fries were soggy, not a fan, maybe better next time?    Looking forward to going back and trying everything else!

We stopped by to try the steamed buns as my better half has a deep infatuation for pork belly (and I short ribs). The server was awesome, very attentive and sweet.  The steamed buns were pretty delicious!    In my opinion, I would take the short ribs meat and put them in place of the pork belly, just to get all the accoutrements...   We also had the Mixed Greens salad which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The drinks looked interesting, will definitely try some out when I'm back for another lunch or dinner!

Craving kicked in...!  Drove 30minutes, walk in & they proceed to tell me that they will be right with me... Ok, no problem... THEN, I place my order just for them to proceed to tell me they are out of bread AND they ran out of bread 30minutes ago (which would have been two hours prior to close).  Would you not have shared that with me right when I walked in...?  Regardless of the fact that there are two grocery stores within walking distance where you could have purchased bread...  Just sad!  I understand the bread is a factor, but really?!?!?!?!?!?!   Unfortunate managing.... Yet you will still maintain business, though I'll go to a different store in the future........
