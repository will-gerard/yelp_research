CASH only tips means the tech here do not report to the IRS. I have never been to a salon that refuses to do tips on credit/debit. I only came here because I was staying at the resort and the pool was closed due to bad weather so I told the girls we would get pedicures. So the CASH only demand for tips is lame and tacky and probably illegal. I had no cash on me so it put me in a weird spot. Second, the girl that did my nails although she did a good job was on her phone half the time. she is one of these girls that cannot put her phone down for 5 minutes. When you are providing a service to someone, stay off the phone. Last time I will come here.

I went here tonight with my kids, sister and her boyfriend only because Zipps was packed. Right off the bat you can tell this is not a new Native or a very nice one but we wanted to eat. First noticeable thing was the smell. I am actually not sure how to explain it but it sort of smelled like cat urine when you walked in the front door. The entrance is not very welcoming at all, and sort of leads you down a hallway where they seat you. We were seated at a stand alone table, preffered a booth but you can't always get what you want. It was just a wide open room with tables, a bunch of TV's. Waitress came out and took order. It became obvious this was not a traditional Native Ny'er but was previously called something else and was in the process of being changed over. I think they were struggling with an identity crisis as this place is simply not up to par with most natives we have been too ( like the one on Gilbert and Germann) and even the one in Dobson Ranch is nicer than this one. We ordered wings for the kids and us adults all got fish n chips. wings came out and could not believe how small they were. I will call them micro wings. Service was slow. The Fish and Chips actually took 20 or 25 minutes. I expressed a bit of concern with the server on how long food was taking. It was finally delivered. Fries were a little soggy but fish good. They took a whopping 10% off the order for the delay.   This location has a long way to go before I will eat here again.. With so many other Natives and sports bars close by no reason to come to this one.

I like to try new places out and this is by my work so I thought I would give it a try. I got a pedi, a lip/eyebrow wax, and had some acrillyc nails removed I just did not want to maintain them anymore. This place is not fancy at all...a basic salon but I got one thing here that other salons do not do. And that is friendly, fast service. I was kind of in a time crunch so they were very efficient in getting all my services done and out of there. The woman who did my pedi spoke some english (yeah) and she did a good job with my feet. While my pedi was getting done another tech soaked my hands in nail polish remover to get the acryllics off. Then while seated someone came over and did my wax, all without even leaving my chair. All the ladies here were VERY polite and appreciative of my business. I got 3 services done and was out of there in 1 hr 15 min. I was happy with all my services and all the ladies there were professional and friendly. I will definitely be back.

I have lived in Chandler for over 30 years since I was a kid and I have never been to this location before. I had a birthday party here for one of my kids and we all had a GREAT time! The lady at the window coordinated everyone great (I think her name is Nicole) and kept checking in on us to make sure we were all having fun. It was Radio Disney time and the music was great and fun. My 7 year old had a blast and my 3 yr old did great using the skate mate. I could not keep him off the rink! Food was ok. We paid the group rate which was more reasonable than the birthday party rates. Look for specials and coupons this is really fun and affordable for the whole family. I skated for the first time since I was a teen!  My 2 small complaints...bathrooms are a little gross and it was a little warm in there. They need to crank the A/C down more. We cannot wait to come back on MJ night.

This location needs to improve their service big time. I hardly ever eat here and only ate here to use up some free meal coupons they gave me since my one visit here was dismal and wound up in a comped bill and they also sent me free meal coupons. Without these free meals I would NEVER come back here. I'll refrain from going into too much detail on my one disasterous visit but this place was a complete joke that day even though they were slow and it took them 45 minutes to bring out our order which were salads....and an inatttentive waitress who was avoiding our table because she knew we were pissed, did not help. So I complained to corporate and got sent my free meals.   First visit we used 2 of the free meal coupons. Service was good, from a young man. Food is good, not great, my husband has had better pasts dishes elsewhere but it was good.   A week later we came back to use up the second batch of our free meal coupons and we ordered the artichoke/spinach dip as an appetizer. That took 20 minutes to get out to us and it was only luke warm. I asked the waiter what took so long and why was it not hot and he admitted to us he forgot to put the order in and had to rush it. Nice. So there is obvious a service issue here. The rest of the meal was ok..I love the BBQ chicken pizza. Otherwise there is no reason to eat here. Crappy service, just ok food. I must be bad luck...2 out of the last 3 visits we had service issues so probably best I just stay clear of this place.

The best car buying experience I have ever had at a dealer. Lou Gordon is direct and just awesome and sold me the car I wanted at a good price in my budget.   I work in the automotive industry and could not find the car I wanted in my price range locally. I just happened to be on cars.com and saw the a car I was interested at a good price and it had all the options I wanted. I called Lou and told him who I worked for and wanted a deal on this car or I would just wait for one to come through auction. He gave me a better than expected price. I went down to the dealership, saw the car, it was better and cleaner than expected it, drove it and worked a deal on my trade and told Lou I want a final out the door price with TTL. The number worked and within 1 hour I was driving it home.. I was already preapproved at a rock bottom interest rate so there was no haggling over a loan. I absolutely love my car and I cannot believe a car buying experience can go so smoothly. Thanks Lou and Schumacher.

This zoo beats the Phoenix Zoo hands down. Look for a 2 for 1 coupon in Hickmans Eggs. I went this past weekend for the first time since they added the aquarium. The aquarium is HUGE and consists of 3 different buildings. The giraffe feeding exhibit is awesome and was my kids fave. Bring quarters for the food machines. They had 1 huge giraffe that just loved all the attention and 2 smaller ones extending their necks out trying to get food. They were sooo cute. We saw a little joey in a pouch of a kangaroo, and we got to feed the lourey birds at 3. The petting zoo was alot of fun too. The Phx Zoo does not have this much interaction at all. Only thing missing was an elephant but we got to see the huge rhino up close, he was only about 20 feet away. The zoo could use some better food vendors..the food is not impressive unless you like nachos, pretzels, etc.. but overall we had a great time. Cannot wait to go back.

Looks cluttered with all the crap piled up in back and it smells funny. Odd set up for a coffee shop which is supposed to be clean and cozy. The owner is rude she is an obese lady who sits at a table on her laptop. Apparently she does not bother to read the reviews of her coffee shop.  I bought a coffee then went outside. Came back in about 15 min later so my 5 yr old son could use the bathroom. He beelined it to the bathroom and as I'm holding their cup of coffee she said to the cashier " make sure they buy something" and he told her we did.  It is messy and smells and looks more like a frat house. Ive been here twice in 5 Years now I know why. I will stick to Starbucks.

I have to agree with the review on the watery sweet n sour sauce. Not sure but I've never had it as runny as it is here. Makes me wonder if they water it down. Besides that it is ok but for cheaper, good food go to Chen's (formerly Big Wa) 2 miles away on Mcqueen and Riggs.

Just stayed here again with my kids for a local staycation. LOVED it. Although this time around we were rained out one whole day(not their fault) we did enjoy the pool this morning. It was my daughters birthday so our waitress Amanda sent a nice little goodie bag to our room. My daughter was so excited to find out what was waiting for her!   The staff is wonderful. The pools are amazing. entire grounds is very kid friendly. They have a lazy river and a slide (not always open), and the main pool is just awesome. At night on the patio they usually have live music. Food at the StoneGrill is great.   Look for package deals here. During the slower hot summer they have a Swing n Fling package I think I paid $169 and that included a $50 resort credit and kids eat free, and the resort fee (usually $27). Both my kids meals were comped when I purchased my adult entrée. Breakfast buffet at Stonegrill is awesome but a little pricey. Save your resort credit for this or the kids eat free when they have it.   Also the $27 resort fee usually includes several things. Parking, internet (Wi-Fi included), bike rental, 2 desserts or appetizers, fitness room. The card my keys came in stated all these, but I don't remember being given this last time as I think I booked a promo (Swing n fling) and that included the resort fee already. So maybe when you pay it separate its included.   Beautiful huge resort. The walk to the car is long. Jacuzzi VERY small almost like a huge oversized bathtub. Those are the only 2 negative things I can think of.   Can't wait to stay here again In the spring I think I will make this a twice a year tradition, once for each of my kids bdays ( June and Sept)  BTW avoid a nail salon down the street from them called Fashion. Read the bad reviews on them. It's a shame they get so much business from the resort yet are terrible.

I have had my Lexus in here twice (unfortunately) since I have been hit 2 times. Tony has taken excellent care of me. Very professional and they did terrific work both times. He is great with follow up too.

The best zipparitas and wings in town. The bartenders are personable and always introduce themselves. I love the vibe. The best sports bar in town.

I live right by here and have heard all the hype on this place so me, my neighbor and my daughter just ate breakfast here. One word-OVERRATED.   Beautiful grounds and scenery but I am rating just by the food, price, and atmosphere.   Set up is a little confusing. You order from a window and seat yourself. I had no idea. Food is pricey and no fresh orange juice they sold Tropicana. Ordered for 2 adults and a child and it was $32.00. For breakfast.   We ordered omelets, bacon, my daughter had kids French toast.   Food so -so and it is not cheap. My daughter did not like the apple crisp bacon. I thought it was ok. Me and my friend both got omelets which were just ok. Came with a pita bread and salad and a side of fruit.   utensils outside and flies everywhere including the inside. We cannot figure out the hype here. We would have had a better breakfast at The Good Egg.

The absolutely WORST service of any restaurant and this is the second time I have been here where service is bad. I guess I never learn. First time here about 9 months ago and had lunch with my ex husband and kids. It took 15 minutes for the waitress to even greet us and I had to ask TWICE for her the she finally decided to show up.   Second time, and most definitley the LAST time here was last night. I reluctantly agreed to meet here even though service really bad last time I was there. My date and I sat at the bar and had dreadful service and was basically ignored by some schmuck named Austin. We did manage to get 1 beer in a timely fasion then that was all she wrote. He floated around the bar, ignored us as we tried to get his attention. I finally flagged him down to ask for some chips and salsa. He forgot to get them and 15 minutes later flagged him down again and asked where our food was, and he asked us if we ordered from him. Seriously?? So went in the back and got us chips and salse something that realistically took him 20 minutes to do which should have taken 2. He then apologizes for forgetting about us, and offers us each a free drink. He brings me my beer, and then totally forgets about my date again! So after 10 minutes and no beer, we realize Austin has left the bar and is hanging out in a different part of the restaurant. I then talked to the blonde female bartender and asked her WTH was going on with our flakey bartender who ignored us and forgotten about us not once but twice, and she told us his name and we asked for help, bad service, our last round of drinks supposed to be comped and my date's free beer NEVER arrived. So she gave him his beer and talked to the manager and our whole bill was comped because the dufus actually never opened the tab or charged us. The blonde bartender was VERY nice and attentive, however cannot believe just how clueless and unattentive the previous bartender was. Most of the wait staff and bartenders need some serious training on how to give good service. Appauling service, so so food, and I will not come here again.

Went here last night for the first time in years. I used to hang out all the time here when I was younger. It was packed by 1030. Great music mostly top 40 and hip hop..no techno yay! Good looking crowd and not as pretentious and the rest of Scottsdale. Everyone had a blast..dancing everywhere. Friendly crowd. Reasonably priced drinks for Scottsdale. I cannot wait to come back. Patties still has it!

This is the nicest city pool in the whole east valley. It is more like a small water park. A huge lap pool, a seperate pool with a large kiddie play area, 2 water slides, spray pad, whirlpool, lazy river. Cheap fun for the whole family. Hours vary so go to their website for summer hours. They do get VERY busy in the summer and are often to capacity by 1pm so go when they open, or later in the afternoon around 2 or 3 and you should be fine.

Worse pizza I have had in a while. We ordered 3 slices and they tasted like they had been sitting out for a while and nuked. Crappy service too. Salad was plain and all oil no vinegar for dressing. . Service half ass. I am surprised they have remained in business fo several years. Also they apparantly have no AC it was VERY warm inside even on a slightly chilly day in Nov so we sat outside the inside was so hot and stuffy. this place totally sucks.

Overpriced. Had my first meal here the other night and the menu was pricer than I thought but it wouldn't break the bank eating here so we gave it a shot. I had ribs. They were ok..not great and for $22 I have had better and you only get one side. My french fries seemed not fresh. Surprised for the price you do not get a small salad. My husband got the prime rib which again was ok..not great and we have had better food for less money at Black Angus and Outback. The waitress was annoyingly trying to upsell sides, as if paying $22 for a meal and one side was not enough. We had our 2 year old son with us so we were going to share with him since he never finishes any kids meal. She tried to get us to pay $13 for a kids meal of ribs. Ripoff. After the bread,  and the little fruit plate they gave him he was full anyways. Ovbiously they try to run your bill up since they can make more as a tip but all the attempting upselling was annoying for overpriced food anways.

My sister and I ate here last night for the first time. Ordered a vegetarian pizza with 3 toppings. Expensive at about $22 for a 16 inch. It was about the driest pizza we had ever had and we had to request extra pizza sauce as they hardly put any sauce on the pizza. Apart from that it was just ok and we were not impressed. At least we tried it.

Great place for dancing if you do not like techno. Located right in old town where there are a ton of nightlife options. Me and my friend went to smashboxx first and hated all the techno so we came here. A mix of top 40 and hip hop. Packed. Good crowd but younger and more casual. A good time was had by all.

Ate here today as my kids wanted pizza for lunch and they sold it by the slice. Ordered 2 slices of pep, 1 sausage, a house salad, 3 drinks. $20. Out of Italian dressing so I req. oil and vinegar.   we sat outside and they brought the pizza out. They brought two slices on 1 paper plate and only 1 or 2 forks even though there were 3 of us. So i sent the lady back inside for more utensils, another plate, and napkins. The pizza was dry and tasted like it had been nuked. The salad was plain and almost ALL oil...where was the vinegar? Salad nothing but iceberg lettuce, olives, onions, and tomatoes and only oil for dressing.   VERY disappointed at crappy service and crappy pizza. Lots of great bars and stuff to do in that area so skip this place.

I go the one in Gilbert on Gilbert/Germann. Super cute clothes and accessories. Size 0-24, they have their own brand of jeggings and skinny jeans. Cute shoes and boots. Bought 2 pairs of earrings there that I get tons of compliments on. Sometimes they are a little pricey so you have to go when its  buy one get one free or 50% off. Love the blouses, graphics tees and no matter what size you are, they have clothes that compliment every body style.

This is GREAT indoor fun for the kids. It is clean and 2 rooms they can bounce. They have open bounce through the summer daily from 3-5. 8.50 per child 3 and over and $5 for under 3. This place is nicer and cleaner than Bounce U in Gilbert.

Service is touch and go here.I will not be coming back. Tony did my fill last time and he was rude. He also burned me a few times with the electric file. Very rough with my hands and gave me an attitude after he stepped on my toe and smudged my polish.

Went here tonight for a birthday. Absolutely awesome food, decent prices and great ambience. Tastefully decorated with a busy  bar, and a sushi bar. We sat at a table. Sushi was great. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken which was enough for 2 people but the rice portion was small so we had to ask for more. Not bad for $10. The hot and sour soup was delicious and came in a huge bowl, enough for 3 or 4 people and that was $6. My only complaint was the establishment was a little warm inside. I am usually cold so it was noticeably warm and several members of my party thought so too. It was 110 out...crank up that A/C! Other than that, we enjoyed ourselves and I will come back.

Best Gelato EVER. The sea salt caramel is their specialty and to absolutely die for. I also love the black cherry. They have many flavors plus the presentation of the gelato is phenomenal. The employees are helpful and always offering samples of anything you want.

Great food and a great atmosphere at night. Nice patio too. The food is great. They took away the live music at one time but now it appears to be back. Lots of tvs too to watch sports. This is a nice bar to go too if you want to go somewhere not packed with wall to wall people. If Blue 32 is packed next door then come here.

The lunch specials are fab. For $6 you get an entree with soup, a crab wonton, and a rice or  another side. I love the General's chicken. No frills cheap place to eat. Portions are huge. This is the one off of Market street near San Tan Mall.

I tried this place for the first time and I hate giving it 1 star but I have too. Over priced bland food. We much prefer Crackers and Co but there is not one really close to us so we thought we would try this place out.   The only really good things we had was the coffee and the fresh squeezed OJ.   My ex ordered the chicken fried steak and actually sent it back. the texture was tough, bland, and tasted greasy. He NEVER sends food back. Instead he ordered something they cant mess up-pancakes.   My daughter had the kids meal with an over easy egg,a piece of bacon and hashbrowns. Still a small portion for $5 which is what all the kids meals are priced at. My son ordered the french toast and for $5 he got 2 pieces of french toast, nothing else.   i ordered an omelette and again, bland and the cheese I expected to be smothered over the top but it was inside it and not much of it. I had to order salsa on the side to spice it up.   We complained to the manager and he obviously took off the chicken fried steak but nothing else and they also knew it was a birthday breakfast and our first time there. I actually left a little embarassed at my choice of dining place.   HUGE disappointment and we will not be back. Honestly we have had better food at IHOP and Village Inn and even Denny's. If you are coming for lunch and hungry, just go to Zipps next door they have the best wings and margs in town.

They usually have a Groupon they will honor if you just go to them directly. I paid $12 a week to try this place out. It is nice to get out of the heat. It is huge and VERY clean. My kids love it. They have wi-fi and a couple TV's. Food is not great. It is just ok and not really cheap somewhat reasonable I guess but the entrée I got was really bad....way too much salt added to the teriyaki it was basically un edible. My kids had the pizza which was ok. Food is not great and they don't want you to being in outside food so they should offer cheap snacks.

This is a nice, clean gym with a pool and brand new treadmills as of 8/2014. I left You Fit due to the lack of child care. My kids love the Kids Care here, they play a movie, Wii and seem to have a good time playing with the other kids. There was a mixup on the enrollment fee as my kids seemed to pay one too since they are enrolled in the kids care but apart from that I do like the gym. $30/mo and that includes the Kids Care.

Expensive. Over priced and overrated. $10 for a burger with no side. I ordered the actual zin burger which I did not like due to the goats cheese. Did a " make your own burger" with cheddar. Good but not worth $9.50.
