Awful service on so many levels.   1. Initial inspector of my broken range knocked on the door and "was waiting around for me for 30 minutes". I was upstairs and heard no knocks. The second he called me I answered and came downstairs. He spent the next fifteen minutes huffing and puffing like a child.   2. After informing me that it would either need to be replaced or repaired, he said he would ask management then schedule the fix. Two weeks later I've heard nothing so I call management who calls them to finally schedule a replacement.   3. The guy shows up today (could've swore we scheduled for the following day (Thursday)) no matter though I was home. He comes in and takes out the old stove, I was in my office working. He yells up that I should sweep where the stove was now if I want to. Thought this was odd and I'm very busy this morning, so I said thanks and kept working. Come down to sign the paper when he's done, and find that there is debris, dirt, and grunge strewn all across my kitchen tile and into the carpeted area. Also, all of the pans/pots that were in the old stove are just placed randomly all over the counter tops.    Hey B and B: success is in the details, like having the decency to sweep up your own mess and put pots and pans where they were.   Sure hope this isn't how they ordinarily conduct their business, if so...it seems a grim road ahead.

I've had a lot of sushi from a lot of places, as many others have. The difference between me and some of those people is that I've had the pleasure of visiting Sakana. In fact, after my first visit I was hooked, and have had the pleasure of visiting countless times.   I'll keep it very simple and provide you the order to end all orders. Why is Sakana better than any other affordable sushi option? Quantity, quality, price...amazing service is the cherry on top. Instead of being subjective I'll focus on a more objective view. Here's what I order EVERY time with my girlfriend:  Drinks $14: Large Kirin and sake x2  Appetizers $2 ($1 each with Kirin purchase!):  Jalaccini (fried zucchini and jalapeno) Fried mushrooms (best you'll ever have) Both come with "miso mayo" the greatest sauce I've ever tasted!  Sushi $7.65:  Spicy tuna roll (the biggest roll you will find, bar none. I kid you. not, these things are stuffed full of tuna)  Mexican Caliente roll (jalapeno goodness, just as gigantic as the spicy tuna!)  Grand total for 2 sake bombs, 2 apps, and 2 giant rolls:   $23.65 + $5 tip  This is the best of the best, and for a price that can't be beat. Oh and here's a bonus: they have gluten free soy sauce!   Other tips: ask for the happy hour cocktail menu, they don't have it out, but most of the drinks are incredible and affordable.

Most overpriced sushi I've had. Only when I'm desperate and stranded on Mill will I suffer this usurious place.   The rolls are small to the point of feeling like you are eating bite size sushi, mind you at a jumbo sized price.   No, no, and no.

Talk about a cess pool of incompetent people. Took an hour to get my car washed. Every one of their employees I spoke with likely didn't graduate high school and, based on their ability to articulate, it's doubtful that they've spoken to a Human being in years.   Embarrassingly poor company.

Chino has lost one star in my book, don't get me wrong it's still the best Phoenix has to offer, and my favorite place...but the portion sizes are becoming less and less satisfying for the price.   I'm not sure why they've gone this route, but surely a divey place can't risk their patrons feeling slighted on quality or quantity.   Come on chino! Start filling those tins of deliciousness to the brim again!

Yes Chino! The Gods of Chinese, Mexico, and Caribbean fusion have answered my pleas!   THIS is the chino I know and love, and have frequented since forever. I have in front of me a tin of deliciousness filled to the brim, an extra snickerdoodle, and I'm sporting a gigantic grin that can only be caused by this sort of food euphoria.   What's more important, the old chino is back on the inside too! And that's what counts right? I was greeted by a friendly girl who offered to help with ordering, and several people were smiling and looked like they were enjoying the bustling Sunday night atmosphere. Speaking of bustling, it was! And it felt great, all sorts of energy in the room and all positive vibes.   I doubt my previous reviews had anything to do with it, maybe I just got unlucky a few times...but whatever it is, chino is back to its rightful place at the forefront of my mind and heart, and it retakes it's reign as the absolute best and most unique dining experience in Phoenix.    Here's lookin at you chino, you absolute legend.

Simply the best takeout experience I've had, time and time again with impressive consistency.   They are always so friendly, and offer you a soft drink while you wait and will occasionally give you some soup as well.   The contents of the bags I skip out of there with are the real gem though.  Sushi: mouth watering, inventive, large rolls. Can't go wrong. I've tried most, and they are all delicious. Specifics? Go Snow White and Spicy Tuna Mango.  Food: I've only had the Singapore chow Mai fun, because it's that good. Get egg drop wonton soup with it to complete the symphony of deliciousness.   The best part? Prices that still puzzle me. Pound for pound, tied as my favorite sushi place in town.
