Great place to get some fast Vietnamese food. The semi-sit down environment is good for eating out on your lunch break. Tables are clean and have a cool zen-like touch with pebbles and stones embedded inside the glass.  But lets talk food folks. The portions are pretty light, but it sure is tasty. BBQ beef is delicious, and they also have a small boba tea and iced coffee offering. Good stuff.

LA Fitness is a mediocre gym that has pretty bad customer service. Registration is a hassle, every now and then you'll get bugged by a trainer to sign up for special training, and the facilities are not always clean.  It's convenient because they seem to be everywhere.  They claim to be 24 hours, but that is not true. They're only open 24 hrs on M-TH.  When you sign up, make sure you don't get ripped off on your monthly plan. Do your research with competing gyms and negotiate. These guys are sharks.

Coffee Rush is a pretty cozy place to grab a cup of joe, especially because it has a great location, right in front of the lake. Great place for hanging out with friends.  Unfortunately the management at Coffee Rush kills the experience. You get hassled to order drinks constantly if you stay longer than 2 hours.  Wi-Fi isn't really free. It expires after a couple hours, so you have to buy a new drink to renew it. If you don't you get kicked out by the unfriendly staff.  Good coffee. Bad staff. Bad customer experience.

I'll admit it, I'm a trendy Starbucks fanboi. But when I'm feeling something different, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is good ol' #2. They have great coffee, the environment is quiet, modern, and very wooden. I usually drink the white chocolate mocha, its light and smooth. I like the ice CB uses - they aren't cubes, and they aren't crush. They're little spheres that chill at the bottom of your cup.

cool joint to study or listen to live music on a friday night. on second thought, hopefully you're not studying on a friday night...but I digress.  coffee is very good, i especially like the white mocha.   its open really late night so its great for a late night caffeine run.   as a music lover, its fun to see tempe's up and coming play cover tunes and original material without being too obtrusive.

You would think chinese+mexican fusion is gross, but in reality it's like a fiesta on the great wall of china in your mouth.  My personal favorite is the jade red chicken, gringo chicken on jerk fried rice w/ black beans combo. The portions are huge, the food is probably extremely fattening, and you *WILL* have a food coma by the end of lunch.  To top things off, they give you a cookie. All for $8.   Hands down my favorite place to eat.

Great middle eastern food in Tempe! The chicken shawarma plate is tasty, especially with the home made garlic sauce. Some interesting drinks include the rose water lemonade, definitely a new way to spice things up.  The place is pretty small, on Friday afternoons it can get pretty packed. Parking sucks, but its ok since the food is so good.  A bit pricey for a small middle eastern restaurant, but the selection and portions do justice.

Hands down the best wings in Arizona. The place gets pretty packed during high profile sporting games, so its a fun environment for people who love the energy.  I'm a huge fan of the boneless wings. BBQ Hot and the Caribbean Jerk are my personal faves, but with over 15 types of sauces to choose from, you be the judge

Lost my health insurance application along with many others according to the health insurance exchange. Very poor customer service and zero accountability. I would stay away even though their prices are low.

Good boba shop located in the asian market in Chandler. They have a host of different boba flavors, with the option of having tapioca boba or jelly boba. They offer it as boba tea or the blended form kind of like an asian frappuccino. I'm a fan of the taro, its smooth, and its purple.  The food selection isn't bad either, I've only had the chicken potstickers and it was tasty.  The place is pretty small, most people go in and out for their boba fix.

I'm not a vegan, nor do I ever eat healthy, but there is something very charming about 24 Carrots.  A lot of people think that eating healthy means sacrificing good flavor, but that is not the case with 24 Carrots. I'm a HUGE fan of the lemonade, and the variety of muffins that are available.  24C has free wi-fi which makes studying/working there palatable.  Highly recommended.
