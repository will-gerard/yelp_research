So it's been a while since I wrote a review, but this needed to be said. I was downtown for the Garth Brooks and it was expectably packed at Cooper'stown. The wait was about an hour, and the hostess was right on the money with that. The food was about average for the price, however the service let a lot to be desired. First the waitress accidently hit my wife in the face with the menu and just moved on. Then I was supposed to have two sides with my burger and they never came. When the food got there, I asked about my sides and was told they would be right out. After about a half hour of not seeing our server again it was time for the show so I had to get up to find our check. I again told the server that my sides never showed up, and was told that she was sorry but the good news for me was that it didn't effect the price. My thought was actually it does, because I was paying for them. She offered to get a manager, but it would take about 20 minutes for him to come over because he was helping behind the bar, because they were so busy. At that point we were over it so we just paid the full bill and headed out.  Again I understand that they were busy, but come on!!!! I know it's not the first time they have been busy, and that is just not how you take care of customers. The only reason this gets 2 stars and not 1 is because it is a cool spot with a lot of awesome rock memerabelia.

I have been here to many times to count over the years and just never thought to Yelp it because it is just such a nice hiding spot. It is a larger neighbor hood bar where most everyone knows each other.   They have plenty of televisions, and a very large area to play pool. The bar is a bar! It has everything you could want unless you are making six figures a year and want something crazy. If you are looking for short skirts, loud music, and $12 drinks, this is not the spot for you.   If you want to just relax and post up to a bar, check it out.

I am new to Yelp but have been coming here for over 20 years. Always lived in the neighborhood, and this is the place to be. The 2/3 cheddar is the only way for me, but no matter what you order you will be happy. Hands down the BEST burger joint in town!!!!!  I can't stop eating here!!!! Every time I go it feels like home. Bob, the owner is one of the nicest people and treats all of his customers like family even if it is their first time there.

First of all....a big fat thank you to CPK! We showed up with no reservations and a group of 9. They sat us almost immediately, and gave us great service.   The BBQ chicken pizza was very good and the Cobb salad is one of the best salads in town. They could have a little better beer selection, but it is a restaurant and not a bar.   We have eaten at just about every CPK location in the valley, and they all rock. If you have never eaten at one, do yourself a favor and try something new.  PS, split a pizza and salad and you will be happy. Their garlic chicken pasta is also very good.

Time to edit my first review of Island's....The first time I was here we had a not so good experience. However, the company reached out and wanted to improve and boy did they.  The same group of 9 of us went out with 5 kids under 5 years old and four adults, and we had no issues. We were able to sit in a corner booth, which we actually kind of need for all of us. Our food came out quickly and everything tasted delicious.  The best part about it was the service and our server. He recognized that the kids were getting hungry and a little out of control. He brought them extra crayons, and was able to get their food and drinks out first.   Island's made a huge come back in my book and showed that they truly are a, "family restaurant" and suits the needs of everyone. It just a cool place to grab a burger and hang out.

This is a little family owned restaurant that has killer Teriyaki Bowls. I eat here almost once a week and I have always had good food, good service, and they have never messed up a order. Everyone from the owner to the cook if friendly and actually talk to their customers.  I am a huge fan of the Oahu bowl, and if you are going to check this place out, I would suggest trying it out. The price is right and the place is clean. If you are in the area give it a shot!!!!

Another perfect Quick Trip!!!! Some times I just don't have time to stop and eat lunch while at work so I will grab some of their pizza or a couple of hotdogs real quick, just so I can eat.   Thank you QT for never failing me!

I don't care who says Carl's is the least healthy fast food place. Their double western burger, and criss-cut fries are legit! I hate going into a fast food place and them giving me stale ice tea, but this location nailed it with a fresh batch.  Food came out fresh and fast, and my order was correct. What else can you ask for out of a fast food place?

I dig Sam's club. You can't beat the prices and every now and then, they have a truly amazing deal that has me buying something that I don't really even need.   Believe it or not their pizzas are awesome and cheap. Plus you can't beat $1.50 for a Polish Dog and a drink.   If you compare the size and the price of their rotisserie chicken to Fry's, you will never buy one at Fry's again.  The only things that drives me nuts is when they move something around to put it on an end cap and I can't find it.  Also the fact that they only have some things for a short time. Some time they have rafts and some times they don't. Some times they have gun safes, and some  times they don't. Some times they have jungle gyms for kids, and some times they don't.   Overall though, I am a Sam's club guy, because the employees have always been cool with me.

I like this place! It is not a 5 star burger place but it is a solid 4. They use good meet, and even though it is not totally original, they let you feel like you are in control of how it is cooked and you top it yourself.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is kind of a throw back, and they generally have some good music....although I did hear a Morrissey song, but I was able to block it out. Its not quite a 50 dinner theme but it is worth taking a look at.  I would for sure go for the 2/3 burger and from there the toppings are up to you.

This is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants! They have killer lunch specials, large dinner portions, and the food is always good.   The take out is perfect for a in home movie/date night, and they have NEVER messed up my order. It is to the point where we don't even need to look at the menu.  Wor Wonton Soup, Extra crab puffs, Sesame chicken, and Mango shrimp.  Even if you do not live in the area it is better then a chain restaurant found on every corner.

Big Fan of their wings!!!! Ordered some takeout with some pizza and wings and really enjoyed it. Their hot wings are top notch and the pizza was pretty good too. The only thing about the pizza for me was just the sauce. It was not bad, but was for sure something different and it kind of threw me off. Still not bad though...  They told me it would be 15-20 minutes and it was. I hate when places say its 15 -20 minutes, then you get there and its not ready. Even worse is when they say its 15-20 minutes and when you pick it up, you can tell it has been sitting a while.  They were spot on with there time, and killed it with their wings. As for the sauce, I am sure it will grow on me or I will learn to appreaciate it more because I am going back.

Ok, McDonald's is McDonald's but this is my favorite location. It is a little bit smaller then most because it is attached to a gas station, but the play area for the kids is great! The play area is actually about as big as the rest of the place.  The people are always friendly and it is always the little things like that which can separate on franchise restaurant location from the other. The other super cool thing was that they were giving out backpacks to the kids as a going back to school promotion. Just something fun that the kids were super excited about.   Thanks McD's

This is a two star Jack in the Box. The food is what it is at each location, and it's not like you don't know what you are going to get. There may or may not be a 5 star Jack in the Box, but if you are aiming high then you should start with service.   I get that its late and there is a line full you drunks in the drive through wanting to get some grub after the bars have closed, but there was still no customer service.   After I placed my order, and finally got to the window the guy started to give me the wrong food but luckily I caught it. I was then told that my  food was given to the car in front of me,  which had left, and I would have to wait on the side.   After I watched about 8 cars which were behind me get there food and drive away, my food was brought out to me. Again I am glad I checked it because I was still missing some of the food I ordered and paid for.   From start to finish, time I entered the drive through to time I left the parking lot, this was a 20 minute trip through a drive through.

NO STARS! This is the second review I have done here because I didn't take my own advise and never come back. This Jack in the Box went from 2 stars to 0. Just don't go here! Drive a mile north and go to the one on Happy Valley.

Went here for dinner last night and everything was perfect! Got there in time for happy hour and had great service at the bar prior to being seated. Once we were seated the waiter kept our drinks filled the entire night.   The NY strip was cooked perfect and tasted the same. My wife had the Filet and shrimp, which I heard was fantastic. I can't say for sure because she wouldn't even give me a bite since it was so good. The meat for both steaks could have melted in our mouths. Did I mention that our steaks were under $30? Good luck finding a better deal on a better cut of beef somewhere else.  The manager did his job and made his way around to each table. I was very impressed with this, because not all of the restaurants still take the time to check on the customers.  Well done Firbirds!!!!

There is no reason for me not to give this Cheesecake Factory 5 stars. There was nothing wrong with anything you look for in a dinning experience.  - Seated quickly - Good and attentive service - Fantastic food for my wife and I - Reasonably priced - Great selection of food, dinks, and desserts  I wish I could remember our servers name but he was on point with everything. Gave us extra bread and kept the ice tea coming.  The BBQ Chicken Pizza was very good, and the wife shrimp sandwich was fantastic! Lets never forget the classic strawberry cheesecake to top it off, and I already can't wait to go back.

This McDonald's obviously isn't getting 4 stars because of its food, because based on food alone, McDonald's is a 3 star at best and I get that.  This McDonald's is a 4 star because of their employees and overall service. Even when they get busy, they have rarely messed up my order. The one time I recall them getting my order wrong, they were quick to fix it, and did not even try to give me any grief about how it was some how my fault.  The inside, bathroom, and even the kids play area are cleaner then the majority of other McDonald's I have been to.  Who ever is running this place and doing the hiring is doing a good job.

I have played this course several times and I really enjoy it. It is challenging but not impossible to put up a low score. The views are amazing and the cart girls have always been on top of it.   I have never had a bad time here and my uncle and cousins seem to enjoy it just as much as I do. The only thing is you need to keep an eye out for some of the hidden wash areas that you can't always see from the fairways.   Oh, and a BIG heads up on the mosquitoes, they are out there if full force and I got tore up on the 12th hole.

My grandfather has been in and out of here for the last couple of months and his longest stay was over four weeks long. The entire situation has been very difficult for the entire family, but Scottsdale Osborn has for sure done their part.  The staff was SUPER AWESOME with my grandfather who was less then cooperative  or even just polite at times. He was a handful but it never seemed to bother the staff. They accommodated him in every way they could, even as he yelled and cursed at them.  I also know that they gave him the best care they could and I not only recognize it but truly appreciate it.

This is just an awesome old school ice cream type parlor which my grandparents used to take my brother and I to after spring training games. They do have a full menu, so you can actually get some food there too.   In the back area there is kind of a Peter Piper set up with games and things for the kids. That is really what this place is for...something different for the kids. I can honestly telling you that your kids will remember you taking them here when they get older and thank you for it. I know because like I said, I remember going here when I was a kid.  Only issue is that everything is over priced, but it is downtown Scottsdale.

I have been coming here since college, and every time I am over in the east valley I try to swing by for a beer. This is more of a sports bar and grill then anything else. They have more TV's then I can count, so at some point during football season you will probably find me checking in here again. If you are a sports fan of any kind you should check it out because they will have something that interests you on one of the TV's.  They also have outdoor seating, which is not always nice for Arizona weather, however their patio area is right on the golf course. It is actually nice to sit out there with the misters and see who comes by on the course.  The beer is always cold and they have specials everyday. Most of the people that work there during the week have been there a long time and super friendly. If you go there a couple of times they will most likely remember your name or at least what your drink of choice is.  The food is actually not bad but it is kind of just bar food. They do have a full menu, so you have a nice selection to choose from. My personal favorite are the chicken strips. They are oversized and the chicken is still moist and tender even though the strips are obviously fried.  I almost forgot to mention that they do have live music most weekends. It's a cool place that you should go check out. It does sit back in the corner of the shopping center but it's there. If you do go check it out, don't worry your not drunk or seeing things, a lot of the items on the wall are up side down on purpose.

This is one of my all time favorite brewery's to go to. It doesn't look like much from the outside but when you walk inside it feels like you are in a wood cabin. I really like the atmosphere there and there are always cool people there.   They normally have about 30 beers on tap and they don't wait a single tap on Miller lite, Bud lite, or anything else like that. If they don't have what you like on tap, then just turn around from the bar and check out their coolers. Behind the glass doors of their coolers they have well over 100 beers you can pick from. You pick the bottle you want, and you can drink it there, or take it home with you. AWESOME!!!  I stuck with the beers on tap and had to begin the night with their classic Orange Blossom which is brewed there and tastes like a melted orange creamsicle with vanilla and beer. Trust me it is good, but it is hard to drink more then one because it is a sweet beer.  Being a dark beer guy I wanted to try a new dark beer and thankfully I was steered away from the Donnybrook made by Victory in PA. I did try a small sample of it and it was like a thin watery version of a Guinness.   The Black Xantus made by Humboldt Brewing in CA came highly recommended, and was FANTASTIC! It is a barrel aged imperial stout that comes in a goblet and has just become one of my favorite stouts I have ever had.   Then to stick with the theme of trying new things I had a Red's Rye which is a Rye IPA made by Founders in Grand Rapids MI. I was actually very impressed with this IPA. I normally do not enjoy IPA's, but I would drink this again any day.  Overall experience here was 5 stars! Everything I drank was right on the money, and the good people there kept me away from the few lack luster beers they had. This place makes you feel at home, welcome and comfortable.   Oh yea, they do have food which looked good too, but it's hard to find time to eat with all that top rate beer there.

McDonald's food is Mcdonald's and we all know that going into it, but at least give me decent service. Part of that is getting my order right which shouldn't be hard since I only order 3 things....2 burgers and a drink.  How I ended up with the wrong drink, one burger and chicken nuggets, I don't know. However, they did do a quick fix for me with only minor attitude for ordering my food right and them getting it wrong.

I have stayed at a tone of hotels in and out of the valley. Tempe Mission Palms really took great care of us. It is a little bit more money to stay here then other hotels in the area, but they say, "you get what you pay for." That really holds true here. The lobby is nice and so is the staff. The bar area has everything you could need but is a also a little pricey.  The rooms were great! Clean, well organized,  and looked to be up dated. This is an older hotel, but you can tell that they have put the time and money back into it to make it special. For a "Tempe" hotel this close to Mill Ave, it is amazing.   The pool area is not bad, but they do take that, "no outside alcohol" sign VERY SERIOUS! I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but the 20 outside cameras around the pool area said different. Oh...watch out for that one metal strip that runs next to the pool! After a couple hours in the sun that thing gets hot, and if you are not wearing your sandals,  it will leave you hopping around.  This place is worth the time to stay at, even if you are just doing a staycation.

AWE.......the original Caramba's, feels like home. This location does not have a bar area like some of the other locations, but I have been eating here for 8 years and it is my favorite location. The staff is always super nice and the food is always out nice and quick. In the few minutes you have to wait before your food is ready you can take advantage of the salsa bar. They give you the chips, you pick your salsa, or pico.  The beef chimi comes with sour cream and guacamole and until I have one here I don't like, I will keep ordering it. I have had there tacos several times as well and they are also very good.   I don't like the 25 cent refills but other then that I can not say enough good stuff about Caramba's.

This is just a very modern church and service. It is far from what I am used to and not at all the kind of setting that I was raised with. This is the third time I have been here and I will most likely keep coming back because the bottom line is the message.   It is hard to get a bad message or the wrong message in church. For the most part the only difference is the presentation of the message for church to church. This church has a bit of everything to offer its members! Food, fellowship, and solid services.   For me, it is difficult to go to any service with 3 young kids, but they really help out with that here. I am able to go to the service and the Sunday school for the kids has been nothing but impressive.

Since I was in Vegas for a week, Ihad to check this place out. Just like everyone else has already said it is smaller then you would think, and it gets crowded quick. I you don't get there kind of early in the day then expect to be standing in line for a little bit just to get in.   That being said, it is 100% worth your time to go check it out. They have even more cool things in the store then they show you on TV. It was almost like being at a museum. They had a lot of classic art, a $13,000+ coin, awesome old guns, and a early Indian Motorcycle.   It would have been cool to see some of the guys from the show, but seriously there were so many people that if I was them, I would hide in the back too. Go check it out and buy something.

Insanely good Flautas!!!!!!!!!!!! This place is in the Venetian and was incredible. It kind of just looks like a Mexican bar by the shops, but it is a fantastic restaurant.   Obviously I had the flautas and they were soooooo good!!! The sauce was like nothing I have ever tasted before and I hope I can find a place in Arizona that has something remotely close to it.   My wife had the tacos with chicken, rice and beans. Everything was delicious!!! I could not believe how much good food we got for the price and their drinks were just as good.   This was the number one surprise find for me after a week in Vegas. There is even seating alone the river area passing through the hotel giving you the sense that you are out side by the river in Italy.

A Wolfgang Puck restaurant  that is another 4 star place. It is very loud if you are sitting outside, but quiet and romantic inside. It is a little pricey but it is also high quality.  They quickly sat our large group and took good care of us. The hand-cut linguini with shrimp and calamari was very good, but a little miss labeled. It was labeled mildly spicy,  but it was more then mild. It got my tongue and mouth tingling after just a couple of bites. Even though I do not like spicy foods, I ate every bite because it was so good. My stomach did pay the price a little later though.   I was also able to steel a bite of my wife's burger, and I wish I could have stolen more. The burger was fantastic and their pizzas look good too.   This was the second fine dinning restaurant by Wolfgang Puck we went to in Vegas and both of them were a fantastic experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This location was amazing! At first I was completely thrown off because it said all CD's $2 and I thought they were going out of business, but that is not at all the case.  This is obviously their clearance store and they have a TONE of the older music that I live for! They also a pretty nice selection of vinyl, which is honestly what I love the most!!!   They may not have the newer stuff, but they do have a lot of the classics for a price that you just can not beat. personally I would still rather go and buy a vinyl album over downloading a song any day. I have found that most of the time the best songs on an album are the ones you never here on the radio any way. So if you don't buy the album and take the time to listen to it, you are probably missing out on one of you new favorite songs.  My mom would say that music is the heart beat of life, and she was right!

Best hotel on the strip!!! My wife and I enjoy staying at a different hotel just about every time we go to Vegas. We have stayed at a dozen or more hotels and the Venetian blows them all out of the water. The overall service and quality of this place were fantastic.  The rooms are all suits and when I first walked into our room, I began calculating how much it would cost to just move in. The king sized bed was as comfortable as any bed I have stayed in at a hotel. The view from our window was a great view of the strip and of the volcano show at the Mirage across the street. The bathrooms are huge, and so is the living room area with each room has. There are 3 TVs in the room, and have a channel for everyone.  When we had our room turned over the house keeping staff was amazing. Everyone was friendly and we had a great time.  My family has been in the hotel business for over 30 years and I have been to more hotels then I can count. The overall experience of The Venetian is second to none that I have been to. Worth every penny!

I love this place! It is a true Irish bar with a true Irish feeling inside. Everything from the music, items on the wall, set up of the restaurant, and drinks scream Ireland. Since I was only there for a morning beer this time, I can't say anything about the food but the Guinness' hit the spot.

I have not been here in a long time, and man Bobby Q's has really stepped up their game. Same location, same awesome feel with better food and service.  We had a great time! The baby back rips were spot on, the pulled pork was nice and moist, and the brisket had very little fat on it. The side were all fantastic as well. Extra cheesy Mac and Cheese and fluffy mashed potato's. This was all washed down with there house beer, which was a Red from Sedona Brewing. No complaints at all on the food.  The service was also great! My pops was in town from Florida so we all went out and our server was more then accommodating the kids and all of our needs. He did a fantastic job, and had several other tables besides ours.   Plus you get a little bonus before and after your meal. Bonus number 1, 10% off your bill when you do a yelp check in. Bonus 2, corn bread brought to you before your meal. Bonus 3, after your meal you get cinnamon  donuts.   I am looking forward to going back and thankfully this is one of the few BBQ places that is a reasonable distance from my house.

Not bad but for sure it is over rated. I hated hearing hip-hop music in what I thought was a county bar. We actually went there twice during our stay in Vegas and overall it was a average bar. There are bars here in Arizona where the girls wear the same skimpy outfits, and drunk girls get on mechanical bulls.   When a girl that goes by the man "cougar" wins the bikini bull riding contest you know there is something wrong. I love cougars.....hell I love them all, but it's Vegas and that was the best they pulled in that night.   Also every time any song came on a few people, who I am sure were paid to be there, began the SAME choreographed dance. They took up half of the dance floor, if not all of it, to attempt to line dance to non country songs. It was annoying to say the least.

This is a nice market place that has something for everyone. There are awesome restaurants for dinner, ice cream places for the kids, shopping for the ladies, and places to get a beer for everyone who wants one.   They let the kids play in the water if you want to let them, and have a sweet fire place out in the open which is obviously more useful in December then it is in July.  This is a good place for everyone and I have never had a problem here.

Completely Amazing!!! Everything you could ever want or need for any camping or fishing trip. It is worth going just to see their set up of stuffed wild life to their fish walk through aquarium.   A little know secret is that this is also a great place to get lunch. The little café up stairs has some good food, with fresh meat. I enjoy the bison burger but you get what makes you happy.  If I had to ding Cabela's on one thing, it would be that a lot of their things are way over priced. However, when you go to the store and see how much they have put into it, it almost seems worth it.

I was super impressed with this place. They cut the meat and cheese just for your order. It's not that meat that has been sitting out in a bin all day either. The 12 inch was enough food to fill me up and it tasted great.  I have found a new home to go get my subs.

I should have been born in the 40's so I could have been a teen in the 50's. I wish there were more drive-in type of places to eat at, not that I have anything bad to say about Sonic.   It had been a while since I have been to a Sonic, and it's just something fun. Double burger and a route 44 ocean water. Good stuff!!! Plus you can get tater tots....where else can you do that? I will say that mayo on a burger is not my thing, but if you don't want it you don't have to have it.  Also, I know it's fast food and all the server is doing is walking out to your car, but it's Arizona and it's 110 degrees out. Give your server a dollar! It wont kill you, and it's better then giving a dollar to someone on the side of the street who refuses to work, but expects your hard earned money for nothing.

I have said it before that Carl's is my favorite fast food burger and the double western is the way to go, but this location was a HUGE FAIL!!!   My buddy and I placed our orders, took our numbers and sat down. 20 minutes later there was still no food. Seriously 20 minutes, no exaggeration!!! So I walk up to the counter only to find out that they cleared our order on their screen and forgot all about us.   No hey man, sorry about that or we'll get it out ASAP. They just pulled some food off of there heating station and put it on a try.   The burger was dry, the onion rings on my burger were hard, and the cheese was old. Not giving up on Carl's but for sure not going back to this one!

Best ice cream in town! Kids love the cotton candy ice cream in a cup, wife loves the coffee ice cream with brownies in a waffle cone, and I could eat the cake batter ice cream by the gallon.  No let down, no disappointments, and they were not out of anything.

We went over here to get some back to school hair cuts done for the kids and had a great experience. Normally my kids move around a fuss the entire time, but the two ladies that cut their hair did a great job. They kept them calm and relaxed, which is amazing in itself, but also did a fantastic job on their hair.  My oldest told me as we were leaving that he wanted his hair cut exactly the same way next time. That is a big deal in my house because he is not a big fan of getting his hair cut.   Good service, good people, good hair cuts, and good prices. It does get crowded when they first open up, but you can reserve a time on line to avoid a long wait.

So, a bunch of guys from work and I went to go check this place out for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was good and the lady at the counter was friendly.   I had the Italian Sub and a drink, which was about average price ($8 and change). The sub was above average but I regretted  not getting the 2 slices of pizza and salad. Their salad bar looked good and for $6 and change, they got that deal with a drink. If you are going here for lunch, I would have to recommend going that route.   No one in our group had any real complaints and the meet lovers pizza looked fantastic. I know I will go back just to give that a try.

No complaints but also nothing to brag about. I got here first thing as they opened on a Saturday and there was already a small line waiting to order their pizza. They lady in front of me ordered 6 pizzas right off the bat and I had to get 8 for a party.  They staff of three that was there actually did a good job getting everything done and out in a fair amount of time. So....you get what you get, and you don't throw a fit.

This is probably the fifth time I have taken one of my cars here and they are awesome! If they can fix a tire they will. If you don't need new tires, they wont try to sell you some. If they don't have what you want in stock, they will get them.   I have been to other discount tires and not had the same service and experience which is why I wanted to take a second to let people know that this one rocks!

We had a great time here! Food was above average, service was decent, and the restaurant was clean. After some drinks and food we took the kids up stairs to play some games  and they went nuts. They have games for all ages, and do the whole ticket thing that the kids love so they can get their little toys at the end.  The bowling ally down stairs is nice. It kind of has a constant cosmic bowl thing going on. The bar area by the bowling ally looks well stocked and has a cool 50's theme going on. If you get there in time for happy hour mixed drinks were half price.  Games = Happy kids Half off mixed drinks = Happy wife Cold Beer and Sports on TV = Happy ME  It just had something for everyone!

Yet another above average QT. Clean store, quick and friendly service, fresh ice tea, and my kind of dip ready to roll.  I still have not seen a Circle K or 7'11 that is up to QT standards.

I am only rating the golf course on this one and if you enjoy golfing in the valley, then this is a course that you need to play. It is one of my favorite courses and it is at least semi affordable.   The greens were clean and run a little fast, but of course that is a good thing. There are a bunch of fun little par 3's, and for me more then enough long par 5's. It is a challenging course but even a beginner can have a good time there.  There is a little water scattered around the course and minimal desert spots. I really enjoy the course and it is well worth the drive.

LOVE this Fry's!!!! They always have what I need, and all the employees are super helpful. The best part is the day care for the kids. It is sooooo hard to get the shopping done with the little ones throwing a fit about going shopping and sitting in the cart. At this Fry's you can take them to the day care area, drop them off and get your shopping done. It turns a hour shopping trip into a 15 minute trip. BEST IDEA EVERY!!!

The food is nothing special, but this is not one of those places you go for the food. You go for all the hot servers and happy hour!!!! The happy hour is awesome, beer is affordable, and so is the food.  They always have some type of game or sport on the multiple televisions, and it a good place to just hang out.  I did mention the hot servers, but they are all also awesome at what they do. They never forget about a table and just treat you well over all.   Check this place out during happy hour or their reverse happy hour, you will like it.

Nice desert course with some great views, but in poor condition. Yes, I know it is summer in Arizona but this was in worse shape then other course I played the same week. It was also a overall bad experience.  My friend set up the tee time on line through the Raven's page, not some 3rd party company, and it was the Raven at Verrado page. Well, when we get there the lady has no reservation for our group, and other then admitting fault, tries to blame us saying we were the one to make the mistake. It wasn't until my friend pulled it up on his email which confirmed our tee time, and also showed the $10 that was put as a deposit. Yup, they took his $10 and still showed no tee time. When he asked where the $10 when the lady stated that she had no idea.  Lucky for us it was a Monday so we were still able to get on because they were not that busy. The first green should have been a sign of things to come as it was about 40% grass and 60% sand. This was par for the rest of the course. All of the greens were this same very poor condition.   The third hole was the biggest bust of all though. As one of my friends was in mid swing of his drive, a grounds man took off in a gator cart right behind him. If you don't know, those gator carts are LOUD. Then he drove up to the green and turned the sprinklers on. I just about lost my mind! Between all the years of golf my friends and I have, we have never seen anything like this.  I am sure this was an isolated incident because Raven's are generally very nice, and I would like to play here again. However, this was an awful experience.

This is one of the better breakfast places in the valley. The service is always good and I can't think of a single time that I have been there and had a bad meal. The breakfast menu has about everything you could want on it, and there is nothing to crazy or fancy, so it is not an intimidating list.   The lunch menu is also pretty good, just in case you are not in a breakfast mood. There is really no way to go wrong here.

I like this place! I went here for a little day drinking and had a good time. Talked to a couple of regulars from the neighborhood and just hung out. The beer was cold and the best thing was that it stayed that way.  If you sit at the bar, there is a frozen strip that you can set your beer on and it keeps it nice and chilled. Very cool concept!!   They have a tone of TV's and they also have a laid back staff. Go check it out for your self.

Not impressed! Over priced for the quality of food and the lack of selection.   We went for lunch and all I can say is I wish we didn't. The only good thing we found here was the desserts. Do yourself a favor and get a nice meal for the same price.

Man sized portions is what you get at Cracker Barrel! The chicken fried steak is fantastic and oversized to the point that you can't help but to smile when you see it. The gravy is the same as their biscuits  and gravy which is thick and delicious.  I will not go here with out getting at least one side of their apple butter for the biscuits as well. The food is a home cooked meal type of food and reminds me of my mom's cooking.  You get the feeling that you are in a log cabin or an older country home with the decorations all around. The old county store that you walk into upon entering the restaurant  is peaceful and relaxing itself. Just going to eat here is like a vacation that makes me want to move to the country, and feel sorry for what society has become.

5 stars!!!!! I have never been this impressed and frankly this is way above what I am used to.  The wife and I wanted to do something nice and WOW this was it.   The service was top of the line and a 5 star dinning experience!!! Everything was perfect. I am almost at a loss of words to tell you how perfect everything was.  We shared the 34 ounce porter house and I was the BEST steak I have ever had!!! I eat a tone of steak and this was phenomenal! We also had a side of bacon potatoes and they were amazing as well. If you want to go some place amazing and romantic while in Vegas this is it.   My two little tips.....1) Make sure you make a reservation, even on a week day or you will not get in.  2) Bring your money!! For just the wife and I it was about $230, but worth every penny

Double Double with frys to go please!!!  Great burgers and food, not just for the price but as an overall meal. If this is on one corner and there are three other fast food burger joints on each of the other corners, I am going here.  Fresh cut frys and grilled onions on my burger, yup...I am in.

I know this place has been here a while because I have been going here since I was a kid. There are other Waldo's locations in Arizona but this it the one to go to. It has been around the longest and you just can't get that smoky flavor at any other location.  I know my BBQ and this is hands down the best BBQ in the state!!! The super sampler is HUGE and probably enough for two people but when I am here, I just don't want to share. Their baby back ribs fall off the bone and have an unmatched flavor. With the super sampler you get a 1/4 slab of baby back and your choice of 3 meets. I always go with the brisket, pulled pork, and turkey.   The brisket was perfect with very little fat. The pulled pork was amazing! It was moist, tender, and fell apart in my mouth. The turkey was about the same, moist and falling apart in my mouth. Their meet makes it easy for me to except getting old because I know that even if I lost all my teeth I could still eat here. Luckily  I should still have about 50 years before I have to worry about that.   I almost forgot to mention the sides you get with that meal....they are unlimited!!!! The fried corn on the cobb and okra was just what I needed to complete the meal.   That is just a little about the food, because you honestly need to taste it to believe it.   My buddy and I went there at 1230 for lunch and the service was great. We were seated quickly and our food was out in just a couple of minutes. The jalapeno  corn bread (which is free) was gone in seconds after hitting our table. Our mason jars of tea and water were refilled faster then we could drink them.   This may not be the fanciest BBQ place in town or the "hippest" right now, but this is the BEST BBQ in Arizona. I lived in Texas, have family from Missouri, and visit Georgia and this is the best. If you were blindfolded and tasting BBQ from the top 5 places for BBQ in Arizona, the food at this location would win.  Everything was just amazing!!!!!!!! Thank you Waldo's!!!!!!!!!!!!

I love this place! Everything on the menu is good, and the passion fruit ice tea is awesome! The food is on the healthy side, but doesn't taste like you are eating plants. Garlic humus is always a good starter that wont disappoint. I have been here several times and never had bad service.

We have eaten here several times and never really had a bad experience. The setting is quiet and relaxing. I have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered and yes....they have sake bombers!  My favorite order is the starting with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps fallowed by the Shrimp with Lobster sauce. Just writing it makes my mouth water. If that doesn't sound like you thing, no worries. They have a very full menu and like I said, I have never been disappointed with anything else we have ordered.  If you have never been you need to go. I know some people try to stay away from chain food restaurants because they think they aren't as good as mom and pop places. I am telling you that this is not a chain food restaurant that disappoints.

I was not expecting much when my group decided that this was where we were going to eat. For me it was just another place to get a $15 burger, and there are more then enough of them in Vegas.  However, I was surprised at how quickly we were able to get a seat and how good the service was. My drink was never empty, the food came out quick and my order was correct.  I wanted to try something a little different and was feeling a little more adventurous (thanks alcohol!), so I went with the Tex-Mex Burger. Basically its a chili burger and it was awesome! A little messy but that is to be expected with an awesomely overloaded burger.   My wife was kind enough to share some of her BLT burger which was equally as good as mine. It seemed like you just can't go wrong ordering anything here. The fries were above average but nothing to out of the norm.    Even though it is a little pricy for a burger it was worth it.

For any guy who does not know about this place you should check it out. It has a good bar area, and the food isn't bad. This place knows the key to success and goes with the age old adage of "sex sells". The waitress' all dress to impress in kilts and tight shirts which is cool. However they are not just there for show, they do a great job and never leave you with an empty cup.  Very cool place to check out.

I feel like every time I go here it gets a little more fancy. The prices are a little above average, but the quality is there to warrant it. I had fantastic service and was really impressed. For some reason one of the guys at my table was giving our server a hard time about splitting our bill but she took it in stride and was more  then accommodating to his needs.    The bacon burger seemed small when it came out but by the time I was finished, I was satisfied. The main attraction for this place are the beers. They have a HUGE selection of beers and the vast majority of them are on draft. For me this is awesome for two reasons; 1) I LOVE BEER and they have lots, 2) I will take a draft beer over a bottled beer every time!   I am really looking forward to going back were I can spend more time drinking and less time eating.

We have been going to a much larger and modern church and this felt more like a home parish. I am not Catholic but a lot of my family and I have attended many Catholic churches, as well as a tone of different denominational churches. This is one I will remember just because of they way it felt to be there.  There is a lot of history here and it would be a great place to get back to the basics and having a home parish.

I can not believe how good the service is at this company! Because summer is here the bugs are out and trying to get in houses. I called them a couple of weeks ago, and they came out to spray in and around my house.  The few little ants that made their way in have not been seen since, however there are still some outside. A employee from the company called a couple days later just to see how things were. I told him about the issue outside, and they sent someone back to take care of it without somehow making it my fault the ants were there or charging me again.  I was really impressed with the over all service, and there price is pretty much the standard price you are going to pay anywhere else.

This place has a throw back diner type of feel to it. I is a little neighborhood place that I think mostly locals really know about. This is by far a breakfast restaurant, which HUGE breakfast  helpings. When they give you the option of a half or full serving, you should really give some thought to the half serving. However, I do believe in going big or going home.  This is one place where I try something new every time and this was the third time I have been here. Their omelets  are very good and the full serving is the way to go. Their Philly Cheese Steak was average and I felt like it was a little under sized. Finally there are the pancakes....these have to be the largest pancakes in the valley! They are just huge and hang over the edges of the plate.  If you are searching for a old fashioned diner or just in the mood for a truly filling breakfast, this is the place for you.

Well below average and not worth going to. This is the most over rated restaurant on the strip. I think Paris Hilton made it famous by having their overpriced dessert, and that alone should have told me that it is going to be a bad experience.  As others have also posted, we had reservations and were on a time crunch for a lunch break between meetings, which is why we made reservations. We had about an hour and a half to eat before my wife had to return to her conference. Well after waiting 45 minutes to be seated after the time our reservation was set for, and then another 15 minutes for our server to show up, we made the mistake of ordering.  Well, my wife did not get to eat because the food took so long and she had to return to her conference. I stuck around for our server to finally re-appear and had them box up our food, which never made it to our table.   After all that the food and fries were less then average and not worth the time, effort, or money it took to get them. There are a hundred better places to eat in Vegas, don't be fooled by this place!

I love Panda Express and it's just one of those places that I don't ever have to look at the menu before ordering. The two item combo with chow-main, orange chicken, and beef and broccoli is my constant order. I almost forgot their tropical ice tea, which is magical in itself.   At this location, I have never had a bad experience. There can be a little wait around dinner time, but they are always cooking more food, so at least it is fresh. I have also been to other locations where I feel like the use way to much sauce, but I have never had that problem at this location.   If you are on your way home from work and looking for a quick easy dinner solution, or out for a quick lunch and want something other then a burger, this may be your spot.

So I was taking my grandmother out for dinner and let her pick where she wanted to go and to my surprise, she picked Toby Keith's. We had a GREAT time!!!!  The I should have been a cowboy burger was awesome. The onion rings on it were nice and fat, and there was just the right amount of BBQ sauce on it. The fries were nice and crispy and not all soggy.  My grandmother had the pulled pork loader, which was a baked potato loaded with cheese, and pulled pork. All I know about it was that my grandma said that she couldn't have been happier with it. I would have liked a bite, but it was gone before I could even ask.  Our server, Rose, did a FANTASTIC job last night!!! She was on top of everything and very friendly. She deserves a lot of the credit for us having such a good experience.  I have been here several times and never had a bad time. I have seen shows there like Shooter Jennings and it is a great place to check out shows too. There is just enough room to dance and have a good time during the shows.   Over all, "I Love This Bar"!!!

First time actually eating at a Chick-fil-A, and I am a fan! The customer service far excited 90% of the service you get at other fast food places.   There was a play area for the kids, which made everyone happy! The gilled chicken sandwich was tender and overall delicious. I am a little embarrassed that it took me so long to try this place. The only negative thing was that the kids chicken nuggets were kind of small, but that is probably because they are actually chicken unlike other places.  I look forward to eating here again.

Location, location, location!!! This place is something different for sure. We went here for dinner and within the first 10 minutes, it was like we were not even in Arizona.   The atmosphere, scenery, and lake make it well worth the trip to the lake to check out this Dillon's location. The Carolina sandwich  with pulled pork toped with coleslaw was very good! The brisket sandwich looked fantastic as well, but the chicken fried chicken was lacking in flavor. There just was not much to the gravy and it was a little disappointing. Their prices were more then fair, however you need to take into account that you have to pay $6 just to get into the lake area.  The drink menu is not bad and the drinks were made with a little extra love if you know what I mean. The beer choices were average but I wish they had more dark beers. I know that dark beers are not the most popular after a day on the lake so I understand why there was only one stout. Drink prices were actually very good.  Despite the few negative things being said, I would go back here in a heart beat!!!

The lunch gyro is always the way to go for me. The meat is very tender and delicious, and their fries are also very very good. Their cups are over sized so when you are paying $2 for an ice tea (like every where else) at least you don't feel completely ripped off here.  The service is always fairly quick, and there is not a seat in the house where you can not see a T.V, just incase there is a game on.  The only thing that was a little downer was how loud the music was. A group of us from work went there for lunch and WoW.... It was like being in a club. We have been there several times and not had this issue, but last Friday the had it cranked up.

Tacos, bacon burger, and curly fries. Late night grub that hits the spot every time. Service was quick, and the employee was nice. There are a couple other Jack in the Boxes in the area and this one is far better. Drive an extra couple miles to go to this one.

I would love to fill you in on more then one kind of their beers but I found what I liked right off the bat, and after 6 of then I was not interested trying a different one.  What I can tell you is that there Irish dry Stout was awesome and so was Rachel the bar tender.   My little tip is to buy a glass/mug. If you buy one they will fill it once for free. In all it will coast you a dollar extra but you get to keep the glass. This was a great spot to hang out and next time I am in Vegas, I will go back.

Well, this place did it's job! It entertained me, got me drunk, and took all my money. Somehow I still had a BLAST here and can't wait to go back.   The rooms were big, clean and well done. I honestly have nothing bad to say about the hotel rooms, or any of the service. It is a upscale casino compared to some of the other ones here in town.  The casino area got kind of packed and I wish they had more black jack tables there. It was kind of disappointing to have to stand around for 30 minutes waiting for a table to open up. I understand that the slots is their money makers but more tables wouldn't hurt.  NOW....about the pool....The pool is a party in its self. There was a DJ playing some music, not my type of music, but it was the kind that got the girls up and moving if you know what I mean. So for that and being dressed in bathing suits the DJ was a hit in my book. I believe that this is a every Saturday event that you should check out.   The pool is big enough where you are not right on top of the guy next to you, and the service at the pool was good. The drinks are expensive, but still worth it. Don't be that guy or girl at the pool without a drink in your hand. The bar area was nice and the line never got to bad.   I was impressed with the Talking Stick and would highly recommend it. For sure one of the top casinos in Arizona.

BEST PLACE TO BOWL IN THE VALLEY!!! Prices are actually fair and they have a bunch of different specials. Bar area has a nice happy hour and $2.50 PBR in a 16oz can all day.  They have the bumpers for kids, and the ball ramps for the real little ones, so everyone can get in on the action. It has been a long time since I have gone bowling and I completely forgot how fun it is.

The brisket was worth the trip! It was flavorful and had a nice smoke ring to it. There was not much fat on it, and they were nice thick cuts. The pork was very moist, but I just wasn't tasting all the flavor I was expecting.  The restaurant itself was low key, but I really liked the seating area in the back. It is set up in a garage area, and is just something different. Their barbeque  sauce selection has everything you could want. I found that a mixture of the sweet with the smokey was the flavor for me.    The only thing I would have liked would have been to order a quarter pound of one of the meats instead of having to get a half or whole pound. I was hoping to try a couple of different things but I didn't want to have to order another half pound of meet.  Overall I it was good and I will be going back there at some point.

Here it is, Hot and Ready! This is the best bang for your buck in the pizza world. This location is always Johnny on the spot for those nights when there is no time to cook dinner.  The kids that work there are always cool with me, and as quick as a pizza goes out they have another one coming out.  $5 for a pepperoni, in a hurry and on the go......can't beat it.

I was here last week for my nephews birthday party it this has a bit of everything. There is a awesome train that will take you and the kids around the park and through a little tunnel which the kids loved.   They have a small snack bar which makes life easy and convenient. They have a larger lake area that I saw some people fishing at which looked relaxing. The play area for the kids I nice and was actually clean for a kids play area.  The only thing that kept this park out of the 5 star range was it splash pad area. It is small, over crowned, and the surface is slippery. I thought the slippery surface was cool at first because kids were treating it like a slip and slide, and it looked awesome. I even saw some adults getting involved. The issue is that the water is dispensed from large concrete figures and when you get to many kids sliding on it at once they slam into each other like marbles, bounce off each other, and slam head first into the concrete figures.   I know because I watched it happen to my kid. I know accidents happen and this was most certainly an accident, but I am sure that this is not the first time this has happened. I am for sure not one for child proofing everything, I say let kids be kids. This is just a heads up to watch them at the splash pad and make sure the coast is clear before they slide across it.

All I can speak for is the strawberry ice cream, and it was fantastic. The price is right, the scoops are huge, and the taste was great. You can tell it is real ice cream and instead of having to search for a actual strawberry, theirs is filled with them.  Good job Tastee Freez!!!

8 piece chicken dinner with 2 sides, 4 tacos, and your choice of deserts for $20!!!!!!!!! I can't cook unless it is on a grill so when it is dinner time and the kids need to eat, this was the spot.  I was just giving it a shot and I was super impressed. The chicken was very good, the beans were fantastic with a smoky taste, and their tacos are so simple but hands down my favorite part.   Thanks for making my life easy El Pollo.

HUGE let down! The food was nothing special, and the eggs on my eggs benedict were way over cooked. The people that think this place is great are the same people I say there wearing skull caps, and bennies as it was 106 degrees out.  Even the set up of this place was horrible! It was way to crowded with table, and it was hard to even walk around. The tables outside are bolted down and so are the seats, so unless you are the size of 6th grader prepare to be uncomfortable.   I get that the metal seats and table look trendy and cool, but it is Arizona and when I can't even touch the table and it is hard to sit....you have made a mistake!  The menu is nothing special and if it wasn't for the drinks they offer this would be a one star place.  If you want to be go some place that looks fancy but fails to deliver then go check it out.

A overall disappointment! I always enjoy going to a place where they give out free peanuts, but normally the fun is throwing the shells all over. Here they give you the peanuts, and no real place to put the shells. Apparently, the floor is not expectable here. Also, the "build your own burger" theme is not original at all! In fact go to McDonald's and ask them to add or take off any topping to any burger and they will.....way to go you "built your own burger." I just saying that this can be done ANYWHERE.  Then I ordered the bacon burger with grilled onions. I ended up with no bacon and for some reason mushrooms. Once I advised them of the problem they were kind enough to give me some bacon that looked like it was cooked yesterday. The bacon was cold, old, dry, and all broken up. At that point I felt like they might as well just have given me bacon bits from a jar.   If I or anyone else is going to pay $11 for a drink, burger, and no fires, they should at least get the order right.

This is a short review because we did not even get to eat here. Our group of 12 made a reservation to go have a nice dinner for one of our friends birthdays. When we got there the place looked nice and had a very large beer selection, so I was a fan.  BUT.......since the vast majority of our group was there on business the check needed to be split so receipts could be turned in. There were a few couples there, so I think we needed it split 8 ways. We were told that they could only use 3 different card and that the tables could not be split. Our group was sitting at 3 four tops put together, and a long bench seat on one side. I feel like it would have been very easy to split us and still keep us all seated next to each other due to the bench seat.  I understand that rules/policies are what they are and are put in place for a reason. However, I think this policy may have been put in place for smaller orders or groups, and it may have been smart for our server to check with a manager before having a group of 12 just walk out the door.  Unfortunately we were forced to walk out without getting to try, what seemed to be a nice restaurant.

I really enjoy Caramba's! It is kind of a cross between fast food and a real sit down type of restaurant.  Their beef chimi is my favorite, and it actually comes with sour cream and guacamole. Their tacos are also worth giving a try too.   I have been to 3 different Caramba's locations in the valley and this is probably the nicest one I have been to. I also really like the one in central Glendale, because it is the original. The food is honestly about the same no matter which one you go to, but each one is set up a little different.  The cool thing about this location is they have a larger, nicer, and more up to date bar area. Plus the food here is way better then other similar restaurants  in the area.

It is what it claims to be, a "Bourbon Room." We got there a little early but still enjoyed every minute of this place. They have a good selections of bourbons and other spirits. I enjoyed some Knob Creek as I was transported back to the 80's or at least what I have been told the early 80's were like.  It was a little more then I would have liked to pay for a drink, but it's Vegas.

Ok, I have read other posts that ran into the same issues that I did here. The food was average but it may have been better if I could have got what I wanted. It is not that they got my order wring, but they ran out of some of the things I wanted. I get that it was dinner time and people had been in there all day, but you have to know when you are running out of guacamole (which is $1.50 anyway), and find a way to get more. It wasn't just the guacamole that they were out of, they also somehow ran out of brown rice.  I ended up going with a cilantro lime rice, which was good, but again not what I wanted. Over all I feel like I got a bunch of beans, ok amount of chicken, no guacamole, and a secondary kind of rice.   I don't come here often and this is not the way to get me going back.

Just tried this place for the first time last night, and I was impressed. Everything is made in house, and has an authentic taste. The original hummus was very good, but I wish it was a bigger serving. Actually the serving size isn't bad, it was just so good that I wanted more.  The regular gyro combo is what I went with and I was not disappointed. I have had gyros at places before and the meat can sometimes be dry, but not here. The meat appeared to be freshly sliced and was nice and moist. I also got extra tzatziki sauce, which I always recommend having an extra side of at any place.  I am glad we found this little neighborhood restaurant close to home.

It is amazing how much better QT is then any other convenient store! This particular location is a little above average just based on how clean and fully stocked it was.  I would love a little larger beer selection, but some how I can still always find something to drink so I guess it's not that bad.  Love the drink selections, and the greetings every time you walk in.

The pizza are singe size, but could be split and shared by two. They are on the upper end of personal pizzas. I really liked the openness of the restaurant, and the bar area.  I would go back just for the bar area, and the waiting space that they have. I am not taking anything away from the food, because the salads and pizzas we had were very good. I just like to drink too, and they had a cool set up.   This place is worth stopping in at if you are hungry or just looking to hang out an get a drink.

I had the Ruben, which was messy but still good. The wife had the Green Eggs and Hamwich and was worth the trip alone. Anyone who comes here needs to try it. Price was average, and service was great.

This place is FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!! The "O lineman" burger will blow your mind!! It is a delicious patty of beef sandwiched between two grilled cheese sandwiches. It was amazing and could be a signature burger at anywhere in the valley. Go there, don't be shy, and give it a try!  Obviously the first part of this joints name is Cold Beers, and YES they live up to that. Their beer selection was very good. Local beers, small brewery beers, and obviously domestic and imports. I went with the lefthand milk stout and was not at all disappointed.   With all the trendy places coming and going in downtown Scottsdale, I can see this being a place that is there to stay. Go check it out because seeing is believing.

I have always been a fan of BWW and everything they have to offer. They have a ton of TV's, plenty of seating, good service, and awesome food. Hot wings and beer.......what else do you need.  The thing that sets this location apart is its location. It is located right in the middle of the Westgate area. If you have never been to this part of town, you should go check it out.   If you like hot wings then this is the place for you. Their hot wings sauce is super hot! They do offer samples of their sauces since they have a huge selection, and I would recommend taking advantage of that before you order.  If you are in the mood for a burger then the Big Jack Daddy Burger is hands down the  way to go! Pulled BBQ pork, and onion rings stacked on top of your burger.....GOOD STUFF!!!!   If you are a sports fan, I would for sure recommend you go there to check out a game and hang out with some buddies.

It was hot out so I thought I would give this place a shot. The frozen custard is something different for me, but I found it very refreshing. For me it was a cross between shaved ice and ice cream and you can't really go wring with either.  We tried the flavor of the moth which was the watermelon chocolate. It was different but good. It was hard to taste the watermelon over all the little bits of actual chocolate they put in it but it did hit the spot.

Great store! Lots of tree huggers and libs, but yet a place we can all just get along = )  Awesome deli with good deals and freshly made sandwiches. The sandwiches are huge are made to order, probably the best deal around.  Fruit and veggies are the best in town. If you are in the area check it out.  Now for the beer and wine section.......both are a little over priced, but they have a good selection. Some of the more hard to find beers, and a lot of local brews can be found here which makes it worth the extra money. The Breckenridge Vanilla Porter is an all time favorite of mine and this is one on only a handful of places in the area for me to get it.

It is nice to have another little watering hole in the neighborhood. Rebecca and Jason did awesome behind the bar, and treated us well.  The place was clean and has TV's all over. I did not get to try the food but it looked good, and I am sure I will try it the next time I am there.   Short review, but it is a chill little spot.

Went here for lunch with for the first time and had a very good time. The place has a cool set up and a nice bar area. I does sit back a little bit off of the street so it could be hard to find if it is your first time there.   The service was fast and that is always a plus. I had a couple of their pumpkin ale which was on tap and it was pretty good! I also had the Vig Prime Dip and I really enjoyed it. It was cooked well, and the fries were done well as well.  I did fell a little out of place since I am more of a country boy, who just happens to have tattoos, but I would go back if "everything" stayed the same.

I love the Gyro, fries and drink combo.....you can't go wrong with the old number 1. Their Gyro is very good and always if a fresh pita. It is worth making a trip here for the fries alone. They are done up perfect! For sure this is a work place hang out during lunch time.  I am sure that everything else on the menu would be equally as good, but I just can't get away from combo number 1.

This park has everything! There is a nice little lake for fishing that has a fountain  in the middle. The playground is covered for shade, and there are tree basic areas to it. One area is for kids between 2 and 5, another is for 5 to 8, and there is an area for bigger kids as well.  They have a large baseball field area with multiple  fields. This park also has large open grass area so kids can just run around as well.  The highlight of this park is their splash pad area! It is a really cool set up and a larger then normal area for the kids to play. Bring a towel and try to joy the Arizona summer.  Good job City of Peoria.

WOW!!! This was the best brisket I have ever had!!!! This place knows how to make/smoke their meat. I had the pulled pork, the fatty brisket, and a buddy was nice enough to let me try some of his turkey as well. All of the meats here at TOP KNOTCH! The owner and his dad were super nice, and awesome people in general.   All that being said, there are several reasons why I think this is a four star place rather then a five star.   First of all it is just over priced. The sides are nothing special, and the beans had more kick to them then I was looking for.   Second, the place is super small! 90% of the seating is outside and even with the misters, you can't ignore the fact that it is 105 degrees outside. No matter how good the food is, it doesn't taste as good as it could when you are uncomfortable.   Third, there are no fountain  drinks or fresh brewed iced tea. How can you have a BBQ place with out fresh ice tea? Answesr: it can't be done right. All there drinks are in cans or bottles. This is kind of related to problem number one with the overall price. You end up paying a $1.50 for a .25 cent can of soda.  Last but not least, and the thing that may have upset me the most is the system to get in. This is a place that once they sell out they are closed. They use a line system like the rest of the world but the line does not matter. Several groups set one person early to get in line, then had random people show up and cut in line as we continued to actually get pushed to the back of the line.   Look, I don't care if your friend is in front, you get your butt to the back of the line. We had a group of 8 that was split into 3 groups because that was the order we got there. That is how a line works! When you show up, you go to the back! If I did not have people there telling me to calm down it would have come to blows!   I was there 10 minutes before it opened and because of cutters it took me 35 minutes after it opened to even place my order. There is just no accountability for doing the right thing anymore.   The food was so good that I will go back, however next time I will get there 30 minutes before it opens, and just start inviting random people who just showed up to cut in front of you.

SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! 4 and a half stars all day long!!!! The only thing holding this place back is its limited size and seating. It is kind on in a food court area at the Venetian/Palazzo and there is not a lot of places to sit.  The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic. I had the combo which was $21, but came with fries, coleslaw, a pound of lobster in the role, and a drink. Tasted great and was worth the price. Oh, and the fries were well above average.  My wife had the lobster tacos and they must have been great because they were gone before I could even ask to try a bite.    It was something different, a little pricy but I feel it was worth it.

This Barro's  location is brand new and after talking to the manager for a little, I think it will be around for a long time. The staff is motivated, friendly, and wanting to succeed.   I had one of there many lunch specials, 2 pieces of pizza and a drink for $4! Hard to beat that deal anywhere. The pizza was fresh out of the oven, and were a decent size.   Like all other Barro's they do have a salad bar with is included with some of their specials if you would rather have a fresh salad. I enjoyed it and will be there for lunch again.

This place ROCKS! Huge TV's, plenty of room, good services, and a decent happy hour. To keep it short and simple.....GO HERE and check it out!!  Caution.....Expect a long wait during happy hour and dinner time. Since it just opened, a lot of people are trying it right now.
