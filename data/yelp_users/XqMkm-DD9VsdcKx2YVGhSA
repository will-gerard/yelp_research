(Lyrics - Survivor - Eye of the Tiger)  Risin' up, back on the street Did my time at work, took my chances Went the distance Now I'm back from my meetings Just a man and his hunger for some Thai  So many times, it happens too fast You trade your passion for quick bite Don't lose your taste on the heat of the spice You must fight just to keep them alive  It's the food of the Wild Thaiger It's the scent of the spice Risin' up to the challenge Of our belly And the Yelper known for his song Orders his plate always right And he's reviewing with his Eye on the Wild Thaiger   Wild Thaiger is locally own family restaurant located around the downtown area of Phoenix.  Chef and owner Olashawn Hasadinratana-Weaver brings the traditional flare of Thai food to modern day Phoenix.  Wild Thaiger has had many TV personalities visit the place, but also celebrities that come by PHX.  I know because of the pictures posted in the back wall - haha!  Decorated with traditional Thai art; Wild Thaiger tries to emulate that Thailand feel along with your cuisine.    I've been here several times once for dinner and once for Happy Hour.  I'm a big fan of the fried noodles mainly Pad See Ew - Stir-fried fat noodles with your choice of protein; chicken, beef, or pork; and of course vegetables.  Seems pretty simple, but this dish packs a punch of aroma and spice.  It's usually fried in a garlic sauce and the amount of heat is based on how much you can handle.  I can't do the Thai spice I'll admit so I always do the medium.  In any case, Wild Thaiger deliveries with the Pad See Ew along with their traditional Pad Thai dish.  Another stir-fried noodle, but this one is with the skinny noodles and it's much sweeter.  Overall, I would come here for Happy Hour because they have 1/2 off appetizers.  Their selection of Thai beer is always interesting something I think you need to try for you beer connoisseurs out there.  Service is always tops and the kitchen which is open for your viewing is spotless - Enjoy!

According to a friend of mines whom is from the motherland - China.  The food here is pretty authentic.  I will have to take her word for it and go from there.  She ordered us some basic Szechwan style dishes, which I think she took it I didn't want to go too exotic.  --- I do actually I do ---  However, there's always next time!  Pigs ear, beef tendon, duck whatever!  Please I don't mind :)  For what we ordered, I thought it was pretty good.  I tell you what though, won't ever come without my friend since she knows how to order.  I'd probably order like a gwy-lo ---  hehe.  Our server was on top of it, but I gather it's because we spoke the language -- Plus 1!  The ambience was pretty basic, but with a bunch of mandarin speaking people eating and chatting away - felt like China after all haha!  - Enjoy!

Lyrics - Modern Talking - Cheri Cheri Lady)  Oh I cannot explain Every time that I sing Or when I Yelp it's for real Take my heart  I've been hungry too long Oh I can't be for long Take a chance for ramen Take a star You need it so There's no place I'll ever go......  Cherry Cherry Blossom It's a Noodle Cafe Phoenix's where you'll find it Listen to your belly Cherry Cherry Blossom Yakisoba Noodles Always like the first time Let me take a bite  Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe has been a love of mines for all times! Ever since my move to Phoenix, I've heard of this place. As time pass and new places started to pop up; Cherryblossom was able to stand it's own ground and still pump out great dishes with consistency!  When I'm in need of a good warm noodle dish I come here. Their Ramen is pretty solid in general, but I'm more of a fan of their fried Yakisobas and my new favorite Nabeyaki Udon hot pot! Packed with a variety of seafood from shrimp, scallops, calamari, hamaguri, white fish, and vegetables; this hot pot is steaming with flavors that mom used to make, if you lived in an Asian household! This dish is definitely recommended on a cold winters day in Phoenix....like 70 or below haha!  Overall, Cherryblossom delivers when it comes to good o noodle dishes. They even serve pasta which I've ever tried. The ambiance is cozy and cute and service is quick for sure, but I can't say they're super friendly at times haha! - Enjoy!

Nice and quaint...just like my buddy said.  I really appreciate restaurants putting their time into cooking.  They make their own pasta - YUM!  I got the special; Wild Boar with marinara and pasta; definitely different and definitely wild :)  Bottle wine?  Why yes please... I love the decor - I'm not a musician by any means except in my shower, but I'm sure the signed pictures of artists say a lot about this place.  The place is "quaint" remember so our service was on top of us; granted we were only 1 of the 2 tables in the place, but they did their jobs and they did it well - much appreciation.  The "Boss" :), was very friendly and greeted us with love too - I totally dig! - Enjoy!

Whatever Yelpers want Yelpers get And Capital Grille, Yelpers want you!  I've made up my mind to have no regrets Recline myself, resign myself, I'm not through yet I always get what I aim for And your food is what I came for!   Nice classy touch as I walked in with a swagger.  Sham-pania sir? Why yes Lurch!  Kudos to Lindsey! Capital Grille was definitely different.  I really enjoy dressing up, but I wish it was little cooler to bust out my blazer, but all is well.  Did anybody checkout the ice sculpture of Yelp -- that was impressive!  Made my random shot of the day!  Sandwiches were amazing, my favorite with the crab cake sandwich yum!  I love crab cakes, but who know to put it between a bun and make it a burger.  The Filet sandwich was soft; I thought it would've slide right off after the first bite, but nope!  The raspberry champagne was best I have to add. - Enjoy

High above the city of Phoenix lies a mansion of secrecy!  Views of the great mountains to the North and South, while the high rises sit dormant.  Where my friends......?    The Wrigley Mansion.....da duh da.......! (Thunder rolls and the lightening strikes -- haha Garth Brooks)  This place was not a joy to find, but it was definitely worth the visit.  Valet is a must here!  This ain't your ordinary "restaurant".  You are free to roam around the mansion at your own risk that is hahaha!  Yes, the mansion is said to be haunted!  Just don't go to the restrooms alone.  Needless to say, this place was a delight.  It's literally someone's mansion.  The view is amazing!  Sit down for a nice brunch with some of your favorite guest.  Mimosas flow freely so why stop at 2 wink wink?  The brunch buffet definitely has a variety of food.  Everything from crepes, Thai chicken, aged meats, prime rib, and tacos!  YUM!  Coffee is great and I would say better than Starbucks, yeah I said it!    Finally, service...it's a fancy brunch I didn't think service is lacking in any way. - Enjoy!

My favorite place on a Monday or Tuesday night!  $20 for a huge plate of bruschettas and a bottle of wine....need I say more?  The atmosphere is just right.  Low key and classy feel.  I almost want to say Starbucks for wine, but I think it's pushing it.  I don't mind attending this fine dine and wine place any other night, but if you're free on Monday or Tuesday...why not?

I got friends in low places At JT's Bar where the whiskey are downed And beer chances my blues away And I'll be okay  Well, I'm not big on chicken wings Think I'll give them a try with hot sauce Oh I got friends  At JT's Bar & Grill! (Lyrics - Garth Brooks - Low Places)  I can't say I'm a regular here, but this is definitely my dive.  The place reminds me of home back in Iowa.  Low, dark, and dink with some crazy-#$% flares hanging around, and I'm not talking about the stuff on the walls - wink!  I've been here enough and it's weird to say I've never really ate here until I saw it was 2012 Best of Phoenix Bar Food! Shawa!?  Sweet and awesome article so my friends I gotta try.    I ordered their wings after watching how the cook made them.  Fried tossed in sauce and then grilled.  Never saw it done like so, but I'm not a fan of soggy wings.  I always order on the side, but the bartender convinced me to go with "the works", and keep it as is.  I'm not a sucker for pretty bartenders, but how can I say no.....ooooh shucks sure!  I did not regret the decision - no foo, not the "Lebron Decision", I'm talking about the wings!  Okay let's stay focused.  The wings came with a perfect texture of crispiness with a jolt of sweet and spicy sauce.  Bam!  Best damn sauced wings I had!  Thanks for the recommendation!  I ordered a side of fries to keep that spicy to balance the spice.    Along with your food you must order a few drinks here.  Not the largest selection in town, but if you need that go to the Yard House ya hippy!  My AA (Affordable Alcohol) group would love it here.  In my opinion the drinks are pretty cheap considered the prices of most places these days.    Overall, great bar to lay low if that's how you feel for the night.  It's right in the heart of the Arcadia neighborhood and it's not as rough as it looks from the outside.  I'm from Iowa and I've seen some rough bars and this place looks the spot, but once you start meeting the people around having a drink.  You'll feel just at home - a Midwest home that is....- Enjoy!

I don't get it!  I've heard a lot of about this place so I had to try.  At first glance this place gave you one of those uh-huh moments.  Yep, sketchy and a little ghetto I thought.  However, I risked my life for a burrito before!  I ordered the taco platter and my sister had the enchiladas.  I had to get some hot sauce out of the ketchup dispenser, which didn't look too clean, but I took my chances.  I would like to stress "hot" since it seemed like it was just "sauce".  I can't say too much about the taco since it felt like sustenance.  My sister's enchiladas weren't too bad.  Coming from the barrios of LA I definitely had better Mexican food.    The place itself is pretty simple. Basic tables and chairs nothing to wow and pop anybody, but I gather they weren't trying to.  Needless to say I've had better.... much better and I don't think I want to risk my life for this.  -  Enjoy!

South Mountain why you so far!?   South Mountain is probably the largest hiking and biking grounds around the city.  I think the longest hike is about 14 miles long across end to end, but then again you have to hike your butt back!    Needless to say as a hiker and trail runner South Mountain offers so many trails I don't think I can get bored.  All the hikes here are moderate and if you take your time you'll eventually finish.    One of my favorite is North of the mountain called  the Holbart Trail, which eventually leads up to the Dobbins Lookout.  There's an old rock building there where most people enter to take pictures.  Another one on the North is called Geronimo Trail.  This is pretty scenic and desolate trail, but again once you reach the top to Buena Vista Lookout it's a nice view.    I haven't been to all the trails here in South Mountain, but I think it's worth a visit since it's good for all hikers and trail runners of all levels. - Enjoy!

Shawizzz......zzzz.....zzzz  What my expectations of this cute little wine restaurant sounded. At first glance I was excited since Saturday nights are my nights to go Yelping! My Wine Cellar is the first stop. My guest and I sat at the bar.  We ordered a few drinks.... we ordered a few drinks....I said we ORDERED A FEW DRINKS!  Oh there you are! For a minute there I was getting thirsty. Granted big party was "in da house" out back rockin' away, but really I'm sitting at the bar. I can reach over to pour my own drink if that is fine.    We ordered some roasted Brussel Sprouts, Classic Pizza, Fries, and Hummus.  Brussel Sprouts were good, Fries were greasy, Classic Pizza -- well was classic and the Hummus was good minus the rock bread we ate it with.  Only thing I dig so far about this place is the ambience.  I love the outdoor patio overlooking the green grass and the band gave it a Jazzy feel.  I think they should invest in more couches, but that's just my opinion. - Enjoy!

Okay...I'm gonna keep saying this until you get it in your head!  You looking for sushi?  Why are you coming here??  Yes, I know it says RA "Sushi" - it also says "Bar" -- come for the drinks and atmosphere.  Really the sushi is not gonna blow any minds anytime soon.  Their reverse happy hour is always a delight since prices drop and the drinks keep flowing :)  Stay thirsty my friends!

Sing it one more time Bo Brooks! :)   Cause got friends in low places, where the whiskey drowns (with my ginger ale) and the beer (in jugs) chases my blues away, but I'll be okay   Now I'm not big on social places (yeahhhh right!) think I'll slip on to the Rustler's Rooste Oh I got friends,  in great places! (my prime rib was fat and yummy!)  I guess I was right this place I belong and yes I will return, cause everythings alright, (and scenic I might add) and I can't say goodnight, and I'll show myself to the dance floor, (live band awesome!) Hey I did mean to cause a big scene, (my two step ain't all that :( ) just give me more than an hour and then,  I'll be as high as South Mountain and you'll always know!!!

I can't say I'm a big fan of buffets.  I can never eat enough to make it worth while.  Seriously, how can you keep stuffing your face after an hour!  However, I enjoyed my visit to this buffet.  Nice Sunday dinner gathering with the family.  I was impressed with some of the exotic varieties.  Frog Legs, Beef Tendon, Octopus, etc...I feel like Andrew Zimmerman!  Bizarre Foods with Bao Hoang :)  Aside from the exotic ingredients the food from the buffet wasn't bad at all.  Sushi seemed "fresh"..... Plus, Coronas and Bud Lights for $1 with food....man I'm coming here just for the drinks!  I like their decor since I am Asian I dig Asian art.  They definitely added an extra flare to make the place pop - totally dig the decor surrounding the Sushi bar.  - enjoy!

How can you go wrong with Cracker Barrel -- I always go to these restaurants when I'm traveling or doing some sort of physical activity that requires some travel.    Hands down some of the best pancakes I've had and that's saying a lot - wink!  I usually don't eat pancakes, but sometimes you just gotta carb load.  If I'm not mistaken they make and bottle their own maple syrup. Served warm this combination of the goowy sticky syrup and pancakes is music to my palate!  Along with pancakes I order their Eggs in a Hole - over easy of course.  Yummy ooze of egg yolk flows through my hash browns and the crispy bacon!  Mmmmm...I can't wait for the next trip.  Might just have to go somewhere so I can go to Cracker Barrel!    Overall, the service here is always excellent.  The place is built like some old cabin with some Midwest flare -- We ain't in Kansas!?  They sell really random things in their store front from shirts, candles, stuffed animals and books....I get confused, but maybe I just need another cup of Joe. - Enjoy!

Yeah I know; it's a chain.  However, I dig the Mac Grill.  They always seem to have great customer service which always enhances the eating experience.  Their app bread was hard, but dip it in olive oil/balsamic and we're golden.  Their lunch special was cool; soup or salad and half sandwich.  It's quick, light and tasty!  Price was good as well...so what's your problem and why can't you go - no excuse not to attend :)

(Lyrics - Sebastian (The Little Mermaid) - Kiss the Girl)  Steam Rice Plates! Egg Rolls! Words!  There you see it Sitting there across the desert It doesn't have a lot to serve But there's something about Pho And you don't know why But you're dying to try You wanna taste the Tea Lite Café... (Sebastian from the Little Mermaid - Kiss the Girl)  Tea Lite Café is nestle in the Scottsdale plaza off Scottsdale Road and the 101; west of the Harkin's Theater. This little gem serves up traditional Vietnamese cuisine on the North side of Scottsdale, which was rare back in the early 2000s when I moved to Phoenix. Vietnamese food was hard to find back then, but now it's starting to pop up everywhere since Pho is fast becoming a popular dish.  When I first visited this joint back in the early 2000s, they had their Pho called beef Noodle Soup instead. I gather it was a way to better explain to the public what Pho really was. Now it's back to Pho and it taste much better too! Yah! Aside from Pho, Tea Lite Café serves up some of my classic favorites Bun Mi sandiwhced, vermicelli bowls, and steam rice plates. Voted best sandwich by Phoenix Magazine back in 2010, their specialty sandwiches, also know as Bun Mi, will not disappoint.  Moreover, it is not to imply the rest of their dishes will disappoint, cause I definitely recommend their vermicelli bowls with your choice of meats; beef, chicken, or pork. Also known as, Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio, it comes along with egg rolls and served a top of fresh carrots, cucumbers, bean sprouts and cilantros. One thing I love about Vietnamese cuisine is the utilization of fresh vegetables and seasonings like cilantro giving it a distinctive scent. Vietnam is heavily Buddhist thus having a strong vegetarian background and the usage of vegetables along with their cuisine.  I'm not sure who the Chef is, but she seemed very friendly and came out to speak to the patrons. Some of the regulars seem to enjoy her company a lot. The waiter was very stiff and seemed like he was mad all the time - reminded me of my dad haha! (Sorry pops!) The place itself is cute and tiny. It was somewhat cluttered, but I enjoy that closeness to be able to see and speak to other patrons. - Enjoy!

As much as I want to provide this place with some love....well I can't!  I think the food here is pretty authentic and good; if you're willing to wait for it.  My buddy and I ordered their pan fried noodles with beef, bbq pork, and peking duck.  Needless to say the bbq pork was pretty good.  Our noodles and duck, well we ate it at  home since it took so long for it to come out.  Needless to say, I was content with my noodles and the peking duck was what I expected it should be.  In the end, having to bring my food home after waiting really put a damper for my dining experience.    I think if they would hire more help it would definitely alleviate some service woes.  The food is good and authentic.  The place needs a makeover for sure, but I guess you should expect that from a dive Chinese food joint! - Enjoy!

Why is this place so hidden!?  I totally dig this place.  Order 5 or more sushi plates and its half off! Yeah you heard me right starting NOW NOW NOW!!! Go Go Go!!!  Kampai!!! Besides the cheap price I thought the Sushi itself was pretty good; then again I'm no sushi snob a-har a-har a-har...(is Tsunami really a sushi roll?) :)  Our service was pretty good -- she was attentive and you know what, I really appreciate the traditional Kimono she was wearing. I love it!  Moreover, the decor was awesome!  Japanese art and traditional murals that give this place a homey feel.  All that is left is to take off my shoes and put on some zori sandals. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Chicago - You're The Inspiration)  You know that Yelp was meant to be The kind of Yelp that last forever And I want you to taste with me From tonight until the end of time  You should know, everywhere I go I'm Bo Biting all the time, on my Yelp On my site  Azculture Baby!  I'm Bo Biting with some stars I'm at Old Chicago You bring feeling to every bite I'm at Old Chicago  Wanna go review it I wanna go reviewing No one deserves more stars than you......  Old Chicago is a chain American pizza restaurant that started out in Colorado.  The location I attended didnt seem too happening so I was a tad bit skeptical.  Needless to say, I've heard great things about it so what the hey.  Oh how I was wrong!  I should not have been doubting the O' Chi-town!  Let's just say I was pretty blown away by their Chicago style pizza.  I understand the pizza rivalry; New York or Chicago, but I got to hand it to them.  Nice thick and doughy pizza crust atop with warm and spicy pizza sauce.  This mouth watering pizza punched my palates and had me singing....and eating of course.  I also tried their fried zucchini and was pretty impressed.  Nice and crunchy while the warm zucchini inside brought the soft texture to this wonderful appetizer!    In the end, if I'm in need of some Chicago style pizza I'll definitely stop by this joint and order a few drinks along the way! - Enjoy!

The Keg is definitely one of my favorite chain steak joints around the valley.  Always done the way you want it!  I went during Restaurant Week so the price wasn't bad at all.  Regardless, I didn't think the price of their meals were too expensive for steaks and lobsters.  The Pecan Goat Cheese Sirloin was awesome!    Service is always good here.  They generally have several very attractive hostesses seating you and then your wait staff is always well dressed and attentive.  They do well with large groups!  The ambience is rustic with a steakhouse look and feel.  Not old fashion by any means, but like a maze while walking around. - Enjoy!

Oh how I love restaurant week!  1st stop was Fleming's -- I totally dig the Fleming salad, then again I'm a big fan of cranberries in general.  Their filet I thought was nicely done, when I want medium I want it medium!  As for dessert -- nothing to rave about since it kind of fell flat for me.  Not a huge fan of chocolate over chocolate with some chocolate.... know what I mean?  Service was real good they were attentive and quick.  Ambience was nothing too surprising except I wish I had wore my blazer with a cigar sticking out of my mouth while walking around with a Wallstreet Journal clip under my arm.  Hand me my walking stick Remington!  Overall, it was a good experience and the food was good.  I though I can't recommend becoming a regular especially with today's food price. - Enjoy!

Hola! Yo quero zopes en tacos  Yes, my Spanglish is tops!  Just like this place.  I would like to announce my new favorite hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint - Lulu's Taco Shop!  I ordered their Zope and el Pastor with rice and beans.  The zope base was different from what I'm used to.  It was actually a hard piece of bread instead of a hard shell tortilla, which wasn't bad at all.  The beef in each of the items I ordered was well braised and soft.  The salsa a top was okay but definitely needed some extra kick.  They have a salsa bar with some pickled carrots, onions, and peppers.  You don't see that around here in PHX often or at all!    The place is well decorated with some Mexican flair.  This is a real dive and what you would expect to have some great food and it did not disappoint!  They only accept cash so don't forget to stop by the bank. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Warrant - Heaven)  I've got a review for your place And I'm ordering in the line It's Brie and Cheese and Pizza And it's looking pretty good  See the waiter going to work Pouring wine in the glass The memories are great and man they're really coming back  I need to be the king of the world! As long as I go Bo Bites this little place!  Liberty Market isn't too far away Closer to it everyday  No matter what my reviews might say   The Liberty Market has been around since the 1930's!  Geez what took me so long to find this gem!?  With a tad bit of modernization and love, the Liberty Market once a grocery store is now an urban bistro restaurant serving clean and fresh cooked entrees in the heart of Old Town Gilbert.  I came here with a friend and shared a few things from the menu.  We started with the Roasted Brie Plate, then ordered the Chopped Salad and Margherita Pizza with pepperoni.    The Brie Plate was fun and well plated; it came with Brie, crustinis, a spring mix salad, green apples, roasted garlic, caramelized pecans, and a guava glaze.  Overall a nice clean start to our dining experience.  The sweet glaze was perfect with our our salad while the pecan provided a crunchy texture.  The Brie we mashed with our crustini bread and topped with our apples - indeed a killer combination!  The chopped salad was lovely mix of kale, cabbage, chicken, dried apricots, jicama, pumpkin seeds, cotija cheese, corn, and a honey serrano vinaigrette; which boggled us for some times during diner!  It was spicy but we couldn't figure out why haha!  In the end, it worked in our palates and a definite must get if you ever attend.  The Margharita pizza was fire wood cooked and simply put; a way to end my dining experience since the dough was soft and crunchy and the pepperoni provided and nice salty bite along with the subtle basils!  Service overall was attentive and kind and the ambiance was open and gave you that  urban city feel. - Enjoy!

Where the heck did this place come from?  It's so hidden!  Fortunately, my eyes are piercing and eagle-like; as long as I wear my contacts I guess haha!    Sushi was real tasty especially from a non-sushi eater like me.  I'm a big fan of octopus -- YUM and I love the lemon atop.  The rolls were okay; it didn't really make much of a difference.  It was somewhat of a reverse HH when I attended; buy a large Kirin and appetizers were only $1.  In that case give me 2 I say!    The place is small and low key.  Great place for a chat and not too loud matter of fact.  Next time I come I have to sit at the bar!  Say Hi to sushi Chef Jay he'll take care of you!    Service was quick, they definitely had a lot of servers for a night like Tuesday.  However, I can appreciate that - quick service, quick food, quick turnover, and quick cash! - Enjoy!

Why do birds suddenly appear?  Every time you are near (in the garden room cause their waiting for you to feed them) Just like me they long to be close to you (especially when you start feeding them bits of fries)  This place is amazing especially the garden room.  I wish I had a better camera phone, but just one small shot of the place doesn't do it justice.  The Food is awesome - had me a Duck Confit sandwich and a side of fries.  Yum yum yum all the way (didn't feel right feeding the birdes duck so I didn't -- it's your cousin man!)  Service was top and on the ball.  They were there when I needed them and they were gone when they needed to be gone :) Zinc Bistro thumbs up! - Enjoy

(Lyrics - Barry Manilow - Copacabana)  Her name was Betty, she was the owner With chef hat covering her hair and a chef coat pressed and fair She would do Flambe and add some salsa And while she tried to be a star Bo Bites always attended the bar Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 They were fun and they had each other Who could ask for more?  At the Cafe, Havana Cafe The hottest spot north of Phoenix At the Cafe, Havana Cafe Food and passion were always in fashion At the Cafe .... they plate and ate!  Havana Cafe is a long staple of the Phoenix valley and one of those gems that every foodie needs to discover!  Unfortunately, for me the located is a little off since it doesn't look too appealing to the eye from the outside simply because of what's around it.  I think signage of the restaurant is fine.    My partner and I ordered based on the recommendation of the server; the Sailors Paella and the Pulled Pork.  Overall, my favorite of the night had to be the Seafood dish - a mixture of crab, clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, calamari, and fish on a saffron rice.  The pot came out nice and warm and my first bite reminded me of some homemade meal with love!  I wasn't too crazy about the Pulled Pork, but not to say it wasn't good.  Cooked with Habenero peppers and bell peppers this dish had some pop!  In the end, the service here was surprisingly very good and on top of things.  Very knowledgeable and my water was filled at all times.  The ambiance might need a little spruce up.  I'm no decor expert by any means, but I didn't care for the fake plants and the furniture was lawn chairs.  I've never been to Cuba, but if that's the idea then I would definitely have a makeover to capture the American style and flare. - Enjoy!

Ok -- K'ODonnell's  Needless to say my experience so far is yes I've been to a more exciting bar & grill in my lifetime.  There wasn't anything special that grabbed my attention at this place.  Sports flair and LCD TVs are great, but food is what pops in my report.  I ordered the Rueben sandwich with sweet potato fries.  I was one hungry man!  I didn't think it was bad, but then again it wasn't good either.  The rye bread was extra crunchy on the edges as well as the middle.  There really wasn't much taste in my opinion except the overpowering onions that really helped moisturize the beef patty because it was pretty dry.  My friend ordered their fajitas which came in several different compartments.  She had to eat a certain way based on her diet and I did remember her saying no tortilla; they came anyways.    Overall, again it was bad, but not good.  I think K O is better left for having drinks and watching the game.  However, if I wanted to add some food to that mix then sorry I'll have to pass. - Enjoy!

I understand the point of trying to reach out to a larger crowd.  In this case, stick to the original.  Don't get me wrong I love Four Peaks beer and the bar in general.  If it's located by ASU.  The North scene for this kind of atmosphere is just lacking and doesn't make sense.  Four Peaks is meant for the college crowd and rowdy rah rah of the kids cheering and jeering the screen as they watch the games.  This Four Peaks seem stale and old.  It almost makes up for it but definitely falls short.  Sorry Four Peaks this part of the town is too steep to try to climb for now.  I'll make my way back South to the original. - Enjoy!

Boston bar in PHX!?  Had to check this out!  Was invited here by a friend telling me this place has been in existence since she's been breathing.  That's a long time - wink haha!   Needless, to say my first impression of the place was -- wow what a poop hole!  However, I've been to worst and I loved it!  I like dive bars, but this place was more sports and please smoke a cigarette bar.  Outdated television sets mixed with some flat screens.    They had your basic bar menu; burgers, wings, and salads.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries.  Nothing to wow about it except it is what I expected to be.  If you ask me I would stick with the drinks and that's about it.    They have karaoke during the evenings most every night.  Lots of country and older music I've never heard of and I consider myself pretty old!  Needless to say the singing can improve, but I'm not once to complain.  I appreciate people who have the courage to sing their hearts out in front of a crowd. - Enjoy!

I'm not writing about the golf here.  I'm all about the food!  I had a dinner reception here for graduation.  The place itself is amazing.  The view of Camelback Mts. is stunning and romantic I must add.  The place is very private and to get in you must have a lot of $$$ or you know someone that knows someone - old money!    We were served a light garden salad with yams and dried cranberries.  I'm a sucker for dried cranberries and yams so you can throw them on a dried boot and I'll eat it!  Our main course was filet mignon -- okay I thought, I've had better.  Finally, dessert, which turned out to be my favorite.  Raspberry puree and crème brulee with a caramel rice cracker atop - sweet & sour mixed with crunchy and softness -- that my friends, is what any dessert should be!  Kudos to the chef! - Enjoy!

Bikinis bikinis oh wait where my drinky!?  Don't expect to see any bikinis at the Bikini Lounge anytime soon.  This place is a total dive close to the heart of downtown.    Overall, drinks are dirt cheap from what I'm used to and the AA (Affordable Alcohol)  club loves it here! 3 drinks for $10 total...wow I feel like we're back in the 90's again with these prices!  The place itself is full of tackiness, but not the cheap look.  "Bikini" clad girls and some naked on the walls.  Only cash accepted and a juke box.  Now that's your dive! - Enjoy

I LOVE PHO!! I love hole in the wall joints.  This is definitely a hole in a wall.  Have I told you I love PHO?  It's my comfort food and Da Vang brings it home.  Old Vietnamese dudes hanging out and chilling, Vietnamese waiters wearing knockoff brand clothing; what more can you ask for at a PHO joint?  I always order the Pho Tai just to checkout the broth first minus the extra stuff.  Yep, it passes the taste test.  Don't forget your Vietnamese coffee - can't eat Pho without one.  I definitely recommend this place - if you're afraid to come don't worry it's AZ you can carry your weapon and conceal it!

For what it is...meh it's okay.  Food is edible and will get you full for sure.  I'm not all into the decor - tad bit tacky, but I whatever floats your boat.  Service was lacking granted I understand lunch rushes, but seriously you don't have to ask if I need a refill 10 times when my glass is still half full - where's my tamales anyways!  I guess if you're really craving for some Mexican food it'll do the job just fine.

I enjoy good bites for a cheap price.  This little hole of a pizza joint surprised me.  One large pizza for about $10 - almost as good as Little Caesars Hot-n-Ready!  Though I really liked their pizza.  The dough was doughy and the sauce was saucy - yum!  Service was okay, but it was like ordering from a fast food joint - is school out or SB1070 kicked out all the good workers??  My server looked like she was 12 - are we resorting to child labors now?  Anyways, decor was cheap and fast.  Looked like someone thought the 80's were back. - Enjoy!

Express indeed! - Express out of here.....  Not to say it was fast, but the food had a salty taste.  I like to keep it to a pinch, but I think they used the whole bag here.  I had some hot and sour soup and boy it was sour alright!  I also ordered the House Special CK - and that's when the saltiness hit me like a ton of bricks.  Wowza!   The place overall was not appealing to the eye.  I wasn't sure if I'd get sick after eating here, but luckily my immune system is strong enough not to get salt poisoning haha! - Good Luck and Enjoy!

Pricey little sandwich joint and cheap atmosphere.  That's the best way to describe this place.  Indeed, my belly was full -- full of bread.  Where's the beef!?  --- oh the 80's!  My sandwich was mostly bread, lettuce and tomatoes.  The clam chowder was probably the delight of my meal (sandwich & soup combo) Couldn't complain much about the service since it was quick.  The place was super cheap on the decor -- though I did appreciate the helicopter ceiling fan.  Think I enjoyed that more than my sandwich -- Enjoy!

I had my perceived expectations of the festival.  At first, it was all that I expected. On opening day, people here there were dressed in medieval costumes and of course stage actors roaming around the crowd.  I can't say I was too impressed by the opening act. However, the fun started as the gates opened!  It seems the parade of jesters and shops go beyond what I had in mind.  The place was huge! Our first stop was to watch the Bagpipes and drums -- definitely worth the suntan!  I loved it!  Jousting was cool, but it was nothing like Knights of Mayhem on the History channel.  I guess it was the PG version.    Food and drinks were pricey but that was a given.  I didn't get to eat the super sized Turkey Leg, but I ate and drank enough it didn't really entice me.  Overall, it was good fun and entertaining.  I really appreciate cultural outings. - Enjoy!

Taka-Takamatsu style, Takamatsu style! Heyyyyy yummy Kim-Chi! Heyyyyy some Bulgogi beef please! Heyyyyy with some vegetable Japchae!  Taka-Takamatsu style, Takamatsu style!  Voted best Korean restaurant in 2011!  I think I enjoyed it the second time around.  Takamatsu is located on the Northwest corner of Arizona Ave. and Elliot.  Signage is poor, but once you find this gem you won't be disappointed.    Taka-Takamatsu style, Takamatsu style offers up Happy Hour daily and some locations have a full on sushi bar.  I would recommend going to Takamatsu's for Korean BBQ.    (Warning you will smell like Korean BBQ after enjoying some Korean BBQ!)  We ordered the Bulgogi beef, Japchae or sweet potato noodles, Haemul Pa Jeon or I like to call it Korean pancakes, and finally some seafood tofu soup.  Like the song, I don't know what the heck I just said!  The Bulgogi beef we cooked ourselves on the BBQ grill in the middle of the table.  Overall, we did a fine job and made sure we didn't burn off all the marinated sauce.  This was the first time I had the Japchae noodles and I thought they were pretty good, but reminded me of the Thai dish Pad See Ew.  The Korean "pancakes" were never my favorite unless it came with whip cream and strawberries and someone from a place called IHOP made it!  I think it fills my belly and that's about it.  Finally, the tofu soup is my overall favorite Korean dish of all especially on a chilly night!  The broth mixed with my bowl of rice is the best.  Steaming hot with a blast of flavors and spices; it warms my soul - Seafood Tofu Soup for the Asian soul, I'm working on the book haha! - Enjoy!

I didn't really eat at this place, but it's a must return.  I love their ambience...Got the western rustic mexican restaurant feel with a huge back patio covered with trees and x-mas lights.  Might I recommend sitting out there.  I enjoyed just hangin there.  Dude that can play and sing Nora Jones - kudos bro!  They have live music I gathered on Friday nights.  The main band played one Fleetwood Mac and one Maroon 5 -- yes that's it....wha! Yeah, I know just a tease and the rest were in Spanish.  Regardless nice hangout spot if you happen to be around downtown Chandler area :)

Don't you forget about me, don't, don't, don't, don't  Don't you forget about me (Simple Mind - Don't You "Forget about me")  The Breakfast Club was a cult classic in the 80's.  The Breakfast Club in Scottsdale does not disappoint.  Though not so much a classic yet, they do serve a mean breakfast - Yum!   I ordered the Eggs Benedict while my partner ordered 2 eggs breakfast.  Eggs Benedict Arnold - haha! (Peter Griffin from Family Guy).  Needless to say I loved a good old fashion breakfast and they did not skimp on the portions.  (Enough for 5 mischievous students hmmm).  Like going back in time, back to the 80's, where breakfast was a time to stuff your face!  My eggs were over easy for sure while the soft and warm hollandaise sauce gently glazed over the eggs and ham.  Not too overpowering and just the right sweetness.  I had my hash extra crispy and my bacon; I like them soft and chewy.  I added some hot sauce and I had myself a grand meal.  Will you recognize me? (After eating here and gaining some weight) Call my name and walk on by (A walk more like a run I'll need) Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling (More like falling asleep) Down, down, down, down (I go!) (Simple Mind - Don't You "Forget about me")  The place itself had a business diner yet modern feel.  Not your typical dive diner for sure!  Service was spot on and keep that coffee flowing! - Enjoy!

What a poop hole!  I love it!  It's 5 o'clock somewhere, pour some sugar on me, love hurts wha!! Record stops..... This place brings it.  Dirty, dinky and tight.  Everyones shoulder to shoulder having drinks and fun.  What's up with the swing seat by the bar?  Still don't know what it's for, but I'm willing to find out!  I totally dig the Wheel-o-drinks = Spin it and where ever it lands you get - for a small fee of course.  I enjoy Dives especially when the owner is the guy checking me in - enjoy!

Can you believe I've been here in the Valley for over 5 years and I discovered this place a year ago!  Zoinks!  Kazimierz Bar where have you been all my life - it was meant to be!  Totally awesome place especially on Mon, Thurs & Sun nights - live music foo!  Thursday nights are my favorite since I totally dig the jazz there.  Their wine flights are magnificent and so is their Antipasto dish - Bang!  Kazimierz has that underground feel; there are no windows!  Plus, it makes me look like I'm part of some secret society when I bring a frist timer.... :P

Yum!  Who knew pork cheeks is so tender and tasty!  I love Restaurant Week!  Ordered some Wild Boar Meatballs and Chili Beef Stew for appetizers.  The chili was pretty good, but I thought the Wild Boat was the best - it was meaty, but not gamey like most non-domesticated animals.  I ordered the Pork Cheeks over corn-bread pancakes.  I wasn't too crazy for the pancakes, but the pork itself was YUM!  Service was great and attentive -- Good service is hard to find these days so I totally appreciate an above average service any day.  Kudos Cowboy Ciao!  There was a good vibe going that night I attended.  I really enjoy the panoramic view of the streets from the inside.  It was Monday night, but the place was hopping and buzzing.  Definitely, a great place to bring that someone special :) - Enjoy!

Round 2 - Restaurant Week again!  This time around I was quite disappointed.  My group ordered pretty much everything on the Restaurant Week menu.  I went with the Seared Ahi Tuna, Short Ribs, and Peanut Butter Bar.  Overall, everything was well cooked, however over....over salty!  The texture was just fine, but in the end too much salt.  I usually drink a lot of water when I eat, but tonight they should have left the pitcher.  My group in general drank a lot of water!  I would talk more about the food, in the end all I can remember was --- dang that was salty!  Sorry gang I don't know if I can go another round for this place. Ding, ding, ding -- Enjoy!

This Denny's is right in the heart of S. Scottsdale - perfect for patrons of the nightclubs afterwards.  Denny's doesn't have the best food in general, but after a night out full of shots, cocktails, & beer -- it sure hits the spot!  I don't condone eating this late, but if you're out on a night of fun with good company; just do it!  The waitresses here are pretty rambuntious; they sure know how to please and counteract with drunk crowd - I appreciate that!  I'm sure they deal with that crap on a weekly basis and are used to it.  Decor is your typical Denny's restaurant - you know that look :)

Roarrrrrrrr! No, it's okay prefer chopsticks :)  This oddly located restaurant is a delight.  When you first walk to the doors you know you're in for a treat -- I feel like making an entrance like Aragorn in LOTR -- you nerds know what I'm talking about.  I was feeling hungry that night and ordered me a "Big Ass Burger" -- no I'm not just saying it because it's big -- It's actually called the "Big Ass Burger!"  Yum!  Filled my little tummy :)  Service is bangin' -- Thanks Mr. Ryan!  The ambience is low and chill with a rustic feel.  No, not because of the age of the people :) - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up)  We're no strangers to Thai You know your food and so do I A full reviews what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how it's tasting Gotta go to a Thai Bistro  Malee's gonna serve you up Malee's gonna sit you down Malee's gonna serve a round and dine you Malee's gonna make you rice Malee's gonna fry noodles Malee's gonna ask your spice and burn you!    I don't recall how many times I've reviewed Malee's but it always turns out for the better for both of us.  Malee's has been a highlight of for Thai food in Oldtown for quite some times as I recalled when I first moved here; and you know what....it still is!  Tonight was a special night as some of my friends and I gather for a birthday party and feast.  We ordered a bottle of wine and went for it.  I ordered their Crispy Pla (A.K.A Fish Candy).  They have other dishes that I love like the Crispy Basil Chicken; bite sized chicken glazed with a tamarind chili sauce, and Drunken Dragon Noodles; rice noodles and chicken tossed with basil and bean sprouts and lightly green curry sauce.  Everyone around the table wasn't sure about my order because of the name, but as dishes were being passed around my dish was becoming the star of the night.  Crispy fried fish drizzled with sweet and spicy pickled jalapeno garlic sauce on a bed of cabbage.  The sauce really was the star since I'm sure you could put in on chicken, beef, or pork and it would still be a great dish.  I love Malee's for their traditional take on Thai food, but also the ability to fuse an American style to enhance it's food.  Overall, Malee's is a must go if you're ever in Oldtown Scottsdale!

Maybe it was a bad night, but after reading the reviews I expected more.  It was quite uneventful.  Walked-in and there was bunch of people in a group.  Not sure what kind of group, but without them the place was dead...Zzzzzzz.  Oh I'm still writing this review!  They have pretty good prices for food, but maybe there's a reason.  To my chagrin it was basic burger and fries with some lettuce and Thousand Island dressing.  Yawn!!! Okay those people left it's just me and my friend now -- crap!  I'm too young to shut this place down!  Service was good, but serving 2 people isn't really that hard.  The cool thing about the place of course is the moose head.  Not much of a hunter, but I can appreciate it.  Matter of fact next time I will become a hunter and search for a more happening place. - Enjoy!

Sorry gang would give this place no star if I could.  Ear muffs if you can't handle the truth -- Parental Advisory!  First off the quality of people that attends this place is piss poor.  If I wanted to be insulted, spit on, and get in a fight. I know where to find it -- this place!  Classless along with a bunch of douches following my lady friends around like a prey.  I had to tell them to stop cause it was creeping everyone out - sorry dude with a dragon shirt can you please stop following!  By the way douche #2 just because I'm well dressed and can sport a tie, doesn't mean I'm gay.  It means I have taste so F-off!  How about that female dog that pointed south and said go away China's that way -- sorry you poor example of a hairless chiuaua; China is technically West.  Unfortunately, you didn't know that because your man feeds you low end pet chow!  As part of an Asian organization I wouldn't want any of my members attend this place.  Only one good thing came from this place -- the doorman was nice. - Enjoy!

YUMMY!  I've heard great things about the Tavern and I'm glad I randomly came one night.  At first, while walking in I thought that place was trying to do too much.  Though on second thought, the waterfall and moat was pretty cool.  In case a medieval army decides to attack I guess.  There's a nice little patio to the side, but I chose to sit at the bar to people watch - "Hungry Eyes"!  I ordered the Green Chile Burrito and boy was is massive.  However, I couldn't believe I ate the whole thing!  YOU, get in my belly!  Felt like mini-me was in my belly!  ooof!  It was definitely well worth it.  The chile was tasty and the black beans were well spiced.  The shredded beef inside the burrito with the chiles were to die for - mmmmm!  I pounded it down with a few drinks.  Gluttony!  Now I just gotta look our for Kevin Spacey! (SE7EN reference!)   Service was good, I think the waiter kept pushing drinks on us haha!  Do I look like I need another one!  Well yes, yes I do.  You know what else is pretty cool about this place -- they have pay phone!  What the heck is that!? - Enjoy!

Oh the weather outside is frightful - but the Coach House is delightful, and since we've no place to go!  Well you get the point and we're not snowing anytime soon in Phoenix :(  and no that drizzle of snow is not considered snowing!  I love this place during X-mas especially - X-mas wrappings all over the walls and ceiling.  X-mas lights all over and under.  Man I hate to be the guy assigned to take it down!  Though it makes this place so cozy.  Drinks are pretty inexpensive here also so bottoms-up!  - Enjoy

This is a cute little pasta joint.  Very New Yorky feel minus Don Corleone :)  I had their pasta pollo which was delicious!  Drinks...well they are what they are... I'm not a big fan of mixed drinks except maybe a Irish car bomb Ouch!  However, order a drink and sit at the bar.  Bartender Brianna was pretty cool and she'll make you smile.  Sitting area for dinner can get crowded but you get a more intimate feel.  If your date likes pasta...well you know where to go now - good luck!

Yummy! Great location I might add.  Oh pizza - necter of the gods :)  I can eat pizza any day anytime.  It's one of those food that is fun and good - please do play with your food!  At Grimaldi's you create your own combination of toppings.  Yes, my friend use your imagination and go with it.  Needless to say, I rather enjoyed my pizza (Ricotta Cheese & Jalapenos) Though it was tad bit spicy, but I can dig.  Ambience is nice kitchenesque wine bar like.  Service was top!  This place can get pretty pricy though - the more topping the more dollars yikes!  However, definitely worth the visit - enjoy!

(Lyrics - Falco - Rock Me Amadeus)  Ooh, Rock me Defalcos! Ooh, Rock me Defalcos!  Ooh! Ooh!  Pa-pa-pa-pa-pastrami, feed me! Pastrami, pastrami, feed me!  Pa-pa-pa-pa-pastrami, feed me! Pastrami, pastrami, feed me!  Sa-sa-sa-sa-salad, soups....feed me! Sa-sa-sa-sa-salad, soups  Defalco's Italian Grocery is my new favorite Italian deli sandwich shop. Literally it's a shop! You can purchase your deli meats, olive oils, and wine here! The wine selection is quite large and the deli meats are from the best -- Boar's Head of course!  My first order at Defalco's and I went for a Pastrami sandwich with a side salad. The Pastrami was delightful as I ordered it on a baguette bread. Perfect crunch to a perfect cured meat -- Uh! The side salad was just an extra for me, but to me chagrin, it rocked my palates! The Italian dressing that came along with it was homemade! Nobody around town I now does this and I don't understand why!? A must have especially when you swing by Defalco's.  Service came with a smile as you would need to order in line. The place is setup like an old school grocery store; as if you stepped back into time! - Enjoy!

Ahh..can't go wrong with Four Peaks.  Local brewery that's been around and serving patrons of ASU and beer connoisseurs for years.  Who ever was their mixologist did a wonderful job; food and beer goes hand and hand very well.  The place is always popping!  Try getting a seat - gotta wait, but well worth it.  Unless you hit-up the bar; first come first serve.  The service is pretty good even when the place is full.  Hot bartenders and quick service -- can't complain!  How about the ambience - well down home fun and chill.  Point is I appreciate a bar that doesn't care what you wear as long as you come with a shirt and pants/shorts/skirt whatever! - Enjoy!

Not bad, I've been to other locations, but this one would probably be my favorite for 2 reasons.  It's the closet one to my place :), 2nd their patio area is on 2nd floor overlooking the streets.  Maybe I like looking over people and watching them or something, but it's rather fun haha!  Gordon Biersch is always known for their garlic fries--don't go to the gym the next day I tell ya if you have a bunch of these blah!  They have their own Gordon Biersch brew of beers; I don't recall each, but they have beer tasting flight which can be fun.  Definitely bring your group of friends to the place!

(Lyrics - Stevie B - Because I Love You)  I got real hungry so I went to Khai Hoan Restaurant And I decided to write this review Just to let them know, exactly the way I feel To let them know my review's are real.....  Because I love pho, but I'll eat anything I'll try out some bun gone, some eggrolls too Because I love pho, don't forget to add the sides I'll be alright, if you want me to be your guide (to Vietnamese food!)  Khai Hoan Restaurant has replaced one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the valley!  Pretty bold statement, but this place deserves my love.  I brought the parents here for a meal and ordered some eggrolls to start.  Nice and crunchy with some hotsauce/fishsauce and bam!  It got me rolling.  I, of coursed ordered some Pho while my bro order the Bun Gone-- My Pho was pretty damn good, nice warm pungent broth and tender beef round eyes.  I love adding the sides of basil, bean sprouts, peppers, and lime -- the amount of mix really depends on how I feel that day.  Some of this and some of that; always a surprise to my palate!  The Bun Gone was freshly made since my bro had to wait for it, but boy was it worth it!  Freshly made flat noodles with ground & fried pork, mushrooms, with a side of eggrolls and Cha, a pork sausage.  Overall, one of the best I've tasted around the valley!  Nice soft noodles and the crunch of the eggrolls brought the texture, while the Cha and pork combinations gave this dish a protein punch!  Wow!  The service here is excellent, but the seating is limited so if you come during the dinner or lunch rush don't be surprised to sit next to a stranger or a new friend! - Enjoy!

Gotta say it's one of the better chain restaurants around in the valley!  American-Italian pizzas and pastas sounds pretty simple, but Oregano's is one of those places that's a must try.  With several locations from Scottsdale, Tempe, Chandler, and even Tucson; you really don't have much reason not to go!    This time around I ordered the Clark St. Meat pizza along with trying out my friends anti-pasto salad.  Again, simple, but tasty.  The salami, peppercini pepper, and parmesan cheese on the salad was very light and not over powering with dressing like most places.  The pizza I ordered thin crust and yes the crust was perfectly toasted and not soggy as I would expect with all the meat ingredients atop.  Tad bit of spice and no need to add more peppers to heat it up - yum!    Overall, food was great and service is very good.  Well trained staff members, courtesy and attentive - A plus in my book! Enjoy!

One of my favorite Irish Pubs!  Love the atmosphere and the entertainment.  The patio on a nice day is a perfect place to hangout for drinks.  The fish and chips is a must and the Shepherd's Pie is a delight and really filling too.  Snakebite? Ouch! Oh wait you meant the drink - sure thing!  Bringing out the Irish in me....what does that mean!? Don't think the Irish and Chinese ever mixed in history...or did we? (The movie Departed was a remake on a Chinese Trilogy - Infernal Affairs)  Our service was quick for a pretty crowded place, but then again it was still early.  I've been there when I couldn't even walk a step....wait that was pretty much every visit to the Rula Bula! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Adina Howard - Freak Like Me)  Let me Bo Bites as I dine I got a little vegetarian inside And you know that my fans  Has got to deal with it  I don't care how I sing I'm not about to stop for anyway Cause it's all about the food in me Mm-hmm   I want some Green in the morning Some Green in the evening just for me I need a Soynami That can satisfy me just for me  If you got that kind of taste Cause I'm into that kind of eats I got a veggie craving, everybody eat Cause we don't give a damn about a thing   Green has been a vegetarian staple restaurant ever since I've moved to Phoenix!  Every time I come back there's something new and something old.  Improvements and renovations are always made in this quaint little corner restaurant.  I don't feel like I'm a hippie when I come here since there seems to be all walks of life young and old that come here.    Today I started with a craft beer and the Big Wac Burger.  I actually order the little Wac with fries since the Big Wac seemed like a little too big for my appetite.  Overall, it was a knock-off version of the Big Mac, but with no processed meat.  I thought it was pretty interesting, but in the end nothing too original.  My buddy ordered their spicy buffalo wings made with soy chicken -- this was probably my favorite bite of the night; spicy indeed and a hint of crunch.  I think if they didn't douse it was the sauce it would have made a perfect combination, but still good overall.  I also ordered the Soynami for dessert; a valley favorite and must eat especially during the summer time.  It's pretty much soft serve ice cream in a pint with toppings of your choice of candies or baked goods.    In the end, Green is definitely a local hot spot for vegetarians, but also foodies whom want to venture out and try something new.  With the popularity of Non-GMO and Vegan movement coming strong; I can see Green staying for generations ahead! - Enjoy!

This place is a total Sushi Dive!  I dig; this is my bar!  It's generally pretty quiet and I can actually hear what you're saying.  I enjoy getting small appetizers here along with my beer.  Reverse every Friday - Sunday!  The food is pretty good - I wouldn't say it's the best but edible.  Service is great - staff here is always friendly and down to earth.  The decor is pretty cool - modern Japanese style.  This is my "No Significant Other" bar - yes so if you're hanging with me and we're going to Crazy Fish you best not bring your partner - you'll get slapped!  Haha - really!  - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - The Lonely Island - Dick in a Box)  You know you've been there for such a long long time And now I'm ready to wait for it in the line Well, you know it's Lunch time and my mouth is open wide Hope you gonna give me something tasty so you know what's on my mind  A burger real special, so take off the bun I'll take a look inside it's at the Chuck Box! It's at the box  Not gonna get me a Burger King That sort of burger don't mean anything Not gonna get me a In-and-Out Cause, you've got my shining Yelp star  Not gonna get me a Mckey burger I guy like me needs something real I wanna get me something that'll hit my heart Something special man!  It's at the Chuck Box It's at the Chuck Box man It's at the Chuck Box Ohh, It's at the Chuck Box man  Where should I start!?  Hmmm...  Well I was told to come here years ago from a friend, but never traveled my way down to the Mills Ave. much anymore since I'm way past my 20's.  However, it was always on my mind and now; Bam! I did it!    The Chuck Box I guess has been around for ages, not my age apparently.  The place itself is a dive.  Made out to look like it's right out of a pioneer wagon with boxes as chairs.  Seating is limited so arrive and be prepared to wait or pickup and go.  The burgers are made from scratch literally.  It's a "build your own burger" place so add toppings by asking the chef.  Overall, the burger is perfect.  Best firewood grill burger I've had!  Mesquite firewood is what they used. The burger is nice and juicy with a smokey scent!  I went lightly on the toppings since the burger itself is so big!  Ordered me a side of zucchini fries and I'm golden!    In the end, I can be a burger snob, but The Chuck Box impressed me.  I don't care for "build your burger" places, but I'll let this one pass with an A grade. - Enjoy

I think I love pizza more than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles -- Cowabunga!  Is it worth the wait is what everyone will ask?  Well let's just say it makes it more worthwhile.  YUM -- Indeed!  First off, if you don't know, I'm what scientists call a carnivore -- Meat!  However, to my surprise my favorite slice of heaven was topped with Arugula & Ricotta cheese - Biancoverde is a must -- oh yeah! (think I'm having a pizzagasim here!)  The bitterness of the Arugula along with the sweetness of the Ricotta was amazing.  Like dude...it was awesome.  Our service was kind, fast, and speedy.  Ambience was cute, quaint, and homey....with a rustic feel.  I wish it snowed in PHX it would've added that extra flair of love and tenderness :) - Enjoy!

Maybe it was an off night - it happens to the best of us.  I've hung out at AZ88 before several times, but on the night I plan to review the place they were so off.  AZ88 Buffalo CK Sandwich -- I'll eat one or two buffalo CK wing, but to make it a sandwich, I can't recommend.  Too much sauce! Also, make sure you chew fast because after a while the buns begin to go soggy - umm mushy bread with CK cover in buffalo sauce.... (Toast the CK it'll dry some of sauce and give a crispier texture)  Service was off too!  I had 1 beer and 2 waters -- that's all.  If you know me I like a few bottles and at least a jug of water with my meal :) - I know I can't get enough H2O!  I understand the place is popping, but after being seated, there was almost no direction for the wait staff.  Ambience is always cool and love the layout and the feel of the place.  Better luck next time! - Enjoy!

Wow!  Place is massive and I feel like a lab rat at times, but this place has it all.  Yes...all of it!  :)  This is definitly your mall if you enjoying shopping as much as Pretty Woman did when she got her "oh confidant" back!  Be ready to walk and window shop.  Prices are high but what do you expect from stores like Louis Vuitton & Gucci.  I enjoyed the scene and after some shopping - go for dinner they have a bunch of restaurants to explore and to fit your taste.

(Lyrics - Ice Cube - Today Was a Good Day)  Just walking to Delux gotta thank god I didn't know they serve sushi that's kinda odd No parking from streets, no prob And they're cooking up some burgers with plenty of hogs (or bacon!) I got my grub on, but didn't pig out  Finally got a some yam fries that I wanna try out Hooked it up for later as I hit the shots Thinking will I live it up, for another happy hour Don't wanna go cause I had me some beer flights  And if I hit the streets, I can get a DUI Had to stop to get another bite Looking in my mirror and was redder than a beet But everythings alright  I got a mini burger, and it's for happy hour all night Called up the yelpers and I'm reviewing y'all Which soup, do you want to try out at all? Get me in Delux and that's no trouble Last week Yelped around and got a duo burger Ketchup and chipotle sauce all the way You gotta believe today was a Delux Day  A Delux day all day everyday!  Yes, Delux is staple burger joint of Phoenix for some times now and now serving Sushi!  Located next to the Biltmore area, Delux burger is known to have a great happy hour and late night eats.    The place is always popping when I attend.  The blue lighting totally weird me out, but it's alright.  I've never came here for breakfast or lunch; needless to say I'm sure it's pretty damn good cause I know the late night menu is awesome.  Craft beer and flights is a must and your fries come in a mini shopping cart!  Don't understand the concept behind it, but it's a whole lot of fries I tell you that much; generally served with a side of ketchup or chipotle.  The burgers here are no joke and one of the best in town.  Nice and moist and the condiment pairings are second to none!  Overall, Delux is a great place to hangout for drinks as well as enjoy a great meal.   Service here is always the best and always a welcoming smile. - Enjoy!

I always tease and joke telling people - Chinese people don't go to church, we go to Dim Sum on Sundays -- am I so wrong?  Regardless, Golden Buddha is an okay restaurant with decent service.  I wonder if the hostess ever smiles (and along the way bring people to their tables with a more welcoming attitude - for you Jay!)  Needless, to say you've made it pass the 1st round.  The waiting staff is quite attentive for a dim sum joint.  The food is alright - not enough MSG! :) Haha okay, I know we can't complain about that.  As for the ambience, it's pretty nice and clean compared to a lot Dim Sum places I've experience, but really some poop-hole Dim Sum places are the best. - Enjoy!

I love this mountain!  One of the toughest, but also closet hike grounds around the PHX area.  For you trail runners this place will kick your bleep!  Echo Canyon is more of a steep climb while Cholla Trail is meant for running in my opinion.  Doing both is super challenging; up Echo Canyon and down Cholla Trail and back again --- woo wee!  Experience hikers going up either way takes about 1 hour 15 to finish, and for you beginners bring lots of water -- it'll be a tough 2-3 hours.  Also, don't try to do both on the same day if you can't.    Overall, one of the best hikes you'll experience since at the top the view is amazing.  You can see the entire valley!  However, this place can get very crowded especially during the early hours.  I tend to go later when the sun is beaming; granted that sucks, but at least I don't have to dodge and run around people. - Enjoy!

2 Things - Either my appetizer grew or I'm just being a chunky monkey!?  I don't recall the last time I finish a pizza on my own - wow!  Look mom I cleaned my plate off!  Yes my friends I had my O face on.  Needless to say food is was awesome.  The ambience was great; it's literally a house with rooms as the dining area.  Love the hardwood floors classic!  One thing I notice was the artwork; I believe they are from local artists - plus fresh flowers on the table...nice touch.  The patio is like walking onto hollywood movie set - Xmas lights hanging from the trees.  Service was good - my server reminded me of that dude from the Devil's Reject - scary but cool dude.  Got a date? ... now you got a place to go :)

Oh FEZ!  What country was that guy from again? :)  I rather enjoy FEZ, I really don't expect much from this place but they always deliver.  Sweet Potato fries with cinnamon...yum!  Their menu is innovative...things I would never thought  that would go well together.  Yet, it works...it really really works.  :)  If you looking to grab a drink or two...not bad spot to pick in downtown Phoenix.

(Lyrics - Europe - Carrie)  When I go Yelp, I see a reason For you to try.  We've been through this before In every town, in every review Yelp knows I sing So please don't ask for more  Can't you taste it in their food This might not be our last goodbye  Chelsea's Chelsea's, things they make are great Chelsea's Chelsea's, I'm sure we'll meet again   Chelsea's Kitchen has been a long time staple restaurant and great eatery for the valley for quite some times.    I've always known Chelsea's Kitchen for great tacos and drinks.  Tonight I went for a glass of wine with my friend and she recommended we started with the French Deviled eggs.  Overall an excellent start!  The eggs were creamy meshed with some pickles and bacon that we added giving it some crunchy texture!  The paprika added an extra kick.  For our entrees and went for the tacos of course; short rib for sure with creamy guacamole!  The shorts ribs were smoky and braised to perfection with a nice subtle and not too strong BBQ sauce atop.  The kale salad was definitely a welcoming new texture and taste to my palate.    In the end, Chelsea's Kitchen is close to my heart because since moving here to the valley I've always known of the is place being consistent and being an awesome place for good eats.  They've never failed me and I don't see them doing so anytime soon.  Service is always tops and the place is very welcoming! - Enjoy!

I gather most Pubs would look like this.  I enjoy my dives dingy, dark, and dink, but this place has a lot of room to fill.  Maybe in case you need to lay down somewhere after a few drinks haha!    I'm sure on a good St. Patty's day this place would totally rock and pop!  On a regular weekend night it's pretty quiet except with the live band which was playing.  They weren't too bad actually and I rather enjoyed some of the covers they played.  I was tad bit thrown off regarding the parking since it's not the best in the world, but oh well.  Funny cause it's literally next a sales lot.  There are a lot smokers on the patio and front door area, which for me doesn't feel inviting.  I hate to walk past a haze of good o nicotine for a few drinks; cause I can't get enough 2nd hand smoke on a daily basis!  I'm probably being to critical.  Sorry smokers don't mean to offend.    Overall the drinks came fast, but my Gimlet was definitely not fresh squeezed lemon and lime.  Right out of the bottle I'm sure so it was extra sweet and tangy - Zip!  In the end, I think I'll wait til St. Patty's to return if anything - Enjoy!

Mm m m....I love Dim Sum!  My family loves going to China King.  I think it's the closet thing to good Dim Sum in the Southeast valley.  China King is not your typical Dim Sum restaurant; it's pretty small place.  Their service is okay, but is such a thing as good Dim Sum service...Ha!  If there is, then you're not a Dim Sum restaurant :)  The Decor here is mediocre, it's plain jane with no pop, but I don't think they really care.  I would still recommend this place if you don't want to travel to the city to Great Wall.  Enjoy!

T.C. Eggington I heard had a great reputation so I decided to attend with my hiking group.    We came real early so it was pretty quiet plus only a few regulars.  The place itself is very old fashion and homey.  We ordered our coffees and drinks then started with the food.  I went plain jane with scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes, while my buddy ordered some pancakes.    I didn't think it was anything special truthfully.  Eggbeater eggs, bacon was okay, and the potatoes where definitely not freshly cut.  The pancake was huge, but real dry because the thickness of it made it hard to swallow!    Overall, I think the place is cute, but need to revamp some of the menu items to attract a more vibrant crowd.  I worked at mom/pop places like these before and we've always attract the same people in and out.  They can't always keep coming and eventually you have to reinvent. - Enjoy!

The Yard House -- what happened to your yarders man!  You used to be cool, but now you submit to the man!  Darn you!  Anyways, Yard House has always been my favorite spot to try new beer.  I really do miss the yarders.  Now they have the footers (yah....)  It'll still get you whacked up for sure.  I like this Yard House for one thing - the nice rides parked in front.  Feel like a kid every time I walk by (Oh that's my car!)  Reverse Happy Hour at this place used to be the place to be, but with Kona Grill stealing all the attraction it's hard to compete.  However, if there's a game on; forget about it! :)  Appetizers here are the best order a few and share with your friends - (spicy wings are really spicy - youch!)  If you don't have friends to share with -- well that's why I miss the yarders :) - enjoy!

I wear my sunglasses at night!  Think that's what I'll do next time I show up!  Minus the lenses so I can actually see haha! I totally dig Shady's!  The name is not literal.  A lot of hip and friendly young people around, and not that pretentious Jersey Shore - yo bro I'm like totally awesome and I'll get that girls number across that "baa".  You go do that --- In any case Shady's doesn't have any windows.  There's a pool table, fireplace, jukebox, and several comfortable couches; what can you ask for in a bar?  If you don't know I'm part of an AA group (Affordable Alcohol) - Shady's definitely has affordable alcohol!  8 drinks = $50 total, that's cheap in my opinion.  Usually, I've paid at least $10 a glass for the stuff we were drinking. - Enjoy!

Gosh what can I say?  I appreciate foreign and low budget films.  Camelview 5 has them - you get the point.  Aside from the films the venue is pretty old school and dinky and nowhere close to the super awesome large IMAX Harkins...but that is understandable.  I'm not there for the seats nor am I there for the concession stands.  I give this place the best!

Sorry Chino Bandido or should I say Chino Bad-Dido....I appreciate the concept - Chinese & Mexican food - I get haha - ha ... er well maybe I don't.  Maybe I'm being too harsh, don't get me wrong, I enjoy fusion dishes, but when you put my fried rice next to my refried beans and call it good; we have problems.  The decor? Well it's a warehouse that has fold-up tables and chairs all around.  What were they manufacturing?  Something they call Chinese-Mexican food, and you just happen to have your mouth open so enjoy!  I give it one star cause I like their mascot Mexican Panda!

(Lyrics - Britney Spears - Baby One More Time)  Oh, Ticoz Resto Oh, Ticoz Resto  Oh, Ticoz Resto how was I supposed to know That something was all right here Oh, Ticoz Resto, I should order soon But now you're in my sight, yeah!  Show me what I should eat Tell me, Ticoz Resto, 'cause I need to know now Oh, because  My hungryness is killin' me (And I) I must confess I still thirsty (Still thristy) When I'm at the bar I'll order mines Give me a wine Hit me, Ticoz, one more time  Ticoz Resto Bar is "sexy and chill" lounge according to what they want to bring to Phoenix - oh baby baby indeed!  I'm impressed and happy to finally hear a restaurant bold enough to admit they want to bring some sex appeal to a restaurant.  S......saucy! "Hit me one more time", with another drink please.     I came here on a HH meeting with some friends.  The place is far from sexy sorry to say. I think it's more chill then anything.  When you say sexy I'm thinking a hot vibe and sultry art and pictures.  Then again it's not an adult shop haha!  They have a dining room and bar room.  Both seem pretty mellow to me - "Show me how you want it to be, Tell me baby cause I need to know now oh because!"  I think they want to be modest, but also have some sort of flair, but either or I think the place is pretty cool.  We sat at the bar today to get some HH drinks and food.  Very good prices I must say so cheaper is good for my alcoholic side!  Nachos to start of course with some chicken.  Needless to say, I'm not a big fan of nachos, but the cheese and shredded chicken really popped. The cheese was melted well and it didn't drag all the other ingredients along while you rip it apart.  My next dish was the Tortas.  Tortas to me is street food, but I totally dig a restaurant that can bring it indoors and make it work.  It worked indeed at Ticoz.  Soft bread and shredded pork; add a little hot sauce and yum!  It was serve with waffle fries; crispy and crunchy.  I'm a texture guy so I love! - Enjoy!

I been here once and I loved it!!  Food here is amazing! Decor is cute, felt like walking into someones home!  It's communal seating so get to know other guest!  Service was great, but before I continue....They're closing this weekend due to the lack of business!  OMG!  I recommend going before you miss out - take care Lola - what ever you want - you get :)

Ever Yelped so much you forgot if you Yelped about a place or not?  Well lucky me -- I forgot about this place, then again maybe for good reason.  For all the hype and cool designs -- the food really didn't match.  I ordered some curry and chicken - it was okay, but I was really hungry so maybe that's why it was okay.  The plating was nice, but maybe that's how they get you!  How about the price?  Extremely pricy for what you get -- I get more excited paying to gas up my car!  Okay the ambience is pretty cool - the Polynesian style decors are nice and fun.  Service? Well we had a large group and I can never understand this, but when you're a waiter; you should prepare for large and small groups.  I was a damn fine waiter in my times and I was always ready to rock!  I won't say they didn't do a good job, but --- they didn't do a good job -- :) I lied!  - Enjoy!

Also known as Squaw Peak, this trail is very popular due to it's location -- close enough to the West and East side of the city.    Here's the deal Camelback is tougher than this one, but definitely worth the run.  If you want a better workout then I suggest to running and hiking the circumference of Trail 302/1A all the way around the mountain and then work your way up to the peak.  This will kick your butt and I would only recommend this to hard core trail runners and hikers.  It should take at least 2 to 2.5 hours to complete for you speedsters.    If you're just planning to do the Piestewa Peak hike then I would time 1-2 hours for amateurs and about 1 hour for advance peeps. - Enjoy!

Hands down one of the best Oxtail soups I've had!  Matter of fact the only Oxtail soup I've ever had!  Haha! I know I'm not pure Asian I guess.  Just my DNA says I am!    Regardless, my bro was raving about this place months before our trip to Vegas.  So I had to try it.  Needless to say, it was yummy and phenomenal!  Oxtail is very fatty and gelatinous so if you can't handle that then this soup isn't for you. Oxtails have strong muscle fibers thus the meat itself, when slow cooked for a period of time comes out perfectly tender.  The broth is what really kicked it into gear for me.  Very beefy at least 10x more then regular beef stew I would say.  With some salt, pepper, and mixed vegetables this bowl of scrumptious soup was out of this world - well at least you can get it at one place!    The place itself is inside the California Hotel off Fremont.  Very dingy and old hotel with coin slot machines; for the kids, coin slot machines predated paper money or voucher slots.  You can even stick them into what we call "Pay Phones" and make calls!  Who knew!  You get the point.  This place isn't full of bang and glam, but for a quick cheap play and some good ass Oxtail soup, it's worth the travel off the main strip - Enjoy!

Classy, sassy, with a dash of salt.  Wildfish is the place to be during happy hours.  Their appetizers are phenomenal and out of this world.  Fresh oysters, fried calamari and some wagyu beef.  Wag what!? Wagyu stupid - Wiki it!  Their selection of wine is always a delight and service is bolting fast.  I think it helps when they're all dressed like penguins; there's so many! - awwe so cute though :)  The ambience is so chill with a nice touch of a lounge.  Happy Hours all day Monday so push that "case of the Mundays" aside! - Enjoy

This place is so wrong it's right...!  Seriously, 24 hours of toasty Philly sandwiches and fries...com'on man...no diet has a chance when you have the opportunity to stuff your face in the middle of the night!  Do people really eat like this in Philly -- 12 inches of sandwich filled with tender beef...I ate half and the rest is for brunch tomorrow with my coffee and a hangover :)  - Enjoy!

I can't say I eat a lot of Filipino food, but my Filipino buddy says it's pretty authentic.  So I'm gonna have to take his word for it.  However, truthfully, I rather eat when he cooks for me :)  Some of the dishes I'm gonna have to pass, but there was a curry like beefy dishes I can appreciate.  It was like moms.  Nothing was overly seasoned, but I feel like it was under-seasoned.  Red Horse beer -- wow -- I drink whiskey these days and this beer got to me (I suck!).  Service, well I think if you speak Tagalog you'll be fine - you'll definitely get better service!  The place itself is pretty blah -- plain and simple.  I'm gathering on a Saturday night the place becomes a Salsa joint.  Nice touch for the business, but they close too early - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Billy Idol - White Wedding)  Hey little Yelper, what have you tried? Hey little Yelper, who's the only one? Hey little Yelper, how's your food reviews? Hey little Yelper, what's the drink you want? Hey little Yelper, Bo Bites  It's a nice place to eat again It's a nice place at The White Chocolate Grill It's a nice place for Star reviews   The White Chocolate Grill is a staple of the North Scottsdale area.  When I'm in need a spot to hit up for some good eats this is probably my pick for a sure bet.  I came here many a times, but usually ordering burgers and steak.  This time around I went for a salad and a fish dish.  My partner and I ordered the Kale & Spinach Salad with goat cheese and raisins added and for the fish entree we shot for the Blackened Mahi.  Overall, I'm glad we added the goat cheese adding an extra sweet but creamy texture to the salad.  The salad originally came with chicken, strawberries, carrots, candied nuts and tossed in a Asian honey vinaigrette.  Overall, a solid salad of crunchy bites and a fresh start to our meal.  Our entree was cooked to perfection with a creamy Creole sauce and crab meat.  The fish itself was moist and meaty.  Service here is always stellar and on point.  We sat at the bar enjoying the view of the game and a beautifully display of drinks.  Whiskey flights to your liking and interesting cocktails; the Chocolate Grill does not disappoint! - Enjoy!

The Gelato Spot has been around for years at this location.  Many restaurants and come and gone, but not this place.    Overall, I'm not really a fan of gelato and desserts in general.  However an occasional stop in to this place always does a body good.  Plus, I've got great memories here!  Local Chefs offering up their concoction of gelato at this location; which is pretty cool.  However, I'd say stick to cooking and leave the gelato making to the experts haha!    The place itself is always updating and changing up new concepts.  I noticed a bar now serving up some coffee and an pizzeria upstairs.  In the end, that is why The Gelato Spot has kept up with the times.  Having the ability to evolve into a new restaurant yearly is a plus in my books - Enjoy!

I was a skeptic of this chemist of brew.  Needless to say, I wasn't too far off.  This is great for a night out with the boys to watch the game.  That's all I can say since I wouldn't recommend coming here to chat.    I ordered me a beer and some fried fish and chips.  I don't like soggy food, but I guess that's how it comes here.  The fried fish was laid on top of my garlic fries, which were way greasy.  As the fish and fries came together it was a hot soggy mess.  I might want to add tasteless too.  The place definitely has a pub look and feel.  Live music when I came that night, but the football game was going on too.  Rowdy fans and loud music doesn't go well, but I guess it wouldn't matter after a few drinks.  Our service was good, but splitting checks again can be a challenge. - Enjoy!

Sushi Ken, apparently they're known for their Udon noodles.  Why not Udon Ken?  Came here with my friends after a brief hike. I was one hungry boy! I totally dig their lunch hour prices, but since my friend told me about their noodles I went for it instead of the sushi & sashimi.   Presentation was delightful, but overall the Soba Noodles I ordered were decent at best. It wasn't really anything special from what remembered. Everyone else at the table had mixed reviews, but it's mines that count! Haha! I plan to give Sushi Ken another try since I didn't get their famous Udon Noodles. Until then stay tuned.  We were watching my boy Jeremy Lin rock, but only people with good sight could see what was happening.  Yes, they need a larger screen!  I don't think a 32in screen does the restaurant and their patrons justice; just a thought. - Enjoy!

He's got high hopes, he's got high hopes --- as for me Nope!  I really wanted this place to be good....but I was a tad bit disappointed!  I ordered some sliders - one of each kind Chicken, Beef, and Pork.  Overall was okay, but what really got me on the sad side was my bun was soggy at the bottom.  Ever try to eat soggy bread?  Not good at all.  We also had some Ribs.  I thought it was again okay since I do like it on the crispy side, but it also had a burnt taste.  Is anything ever good burnt?  Nope!    The workers there were great and I think they do a good job.  The place itself is like a shed with some decors.  They do have TVs for the game, but I'm not sure I want to venture here to watch it. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Epic - Faith No More)  Can you taste it, see it, try it today? If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway You will never understand it until you eat fast And it taste so good, it's like the nectar of gods  It's so good, it's so fresh, it's alright It's so groovy, it's outta sight You can touch it, smell it, taste it so sweet But it makes no difference cuz it knocks you off your feet  At Blue Agave Mexican Cantina....  Gotta say this place has had it's ups and downs!  This time around was definitely on the up side.    I visited after a Fun Run across the street with RoadRunner Sports.  The place was packing with runners, but they were prepared!  Chips and salsa on the table were great!  Is it just me or do we all gauge Mexican restaurants by their chips and salsa!?  Needless to say, chips and salsa here was excellent -- not too spicy, but not to bland.  I ordered the Carne Asada Rice Bowl for my main entree.  Overall a solid meal for any runner.  Packed with rice, cheese, lettuce and tender beef.  Again, no need to add the spice.  This dish had enough kick to it!  The ambiance was similar to a sports bar, but of course with some Mexican flare.  The service was on the ball that night and in the end a definite revisit is to come! - Enjoy!

Dropped by this place cause I needed a quick bite and it was new to me.  Well needless to say I ate and left.  I don't even remember what I ate, but it was food for sure -- I think!? Okay gotta stop being mean.  Let's just say it wasn't anything "new".  Nothing I couldn't have ordered say from Rubio's or Chipotle.  Yo quero Taco Bells please :(  The place itself was decorated with some traditional Mexican portraits and paintings in an industrial-like setting.  Kinda odd, but whatever tickles your senses I guess. - Enjoy!

I don't know  What Taiko's got  But it plays with my emotions (and stomach) I want so much "Sake", I want to hold you near Want the taste of sweet and tender sushi on....my tongue Can't stand the thought of it in somebody's mouth Got to have your taste, got to have it all....to myself I say yeah..yeah....yeah yeah  Want to go to Taiko's, Taiko's mmmm Want to go to Taiko's, Taiko's, Taiko Restaurant Want to go to Taiko's, Taiko's, Taiko Restaurant (Billy Ocean - Loverboy lyrics)  Taiko is located off Cooper and Ray in South Chandler.  I love this mom and pop shop simply because I enjoy supporting our local businesses.  The also serve up some great food and fun.    At least once a month Taiko has a sake tasting gathering.  At happy hour prices and shots of exotic sake; what's not to like?  Maggie one of the owners travels to sake conventions and orders them from all over the country to get these delicate drinks.  For $15 a head, you'll get 5 shots of the Sake of your choice all laid out on the table.  They have everything from filtered sake, nonfiltered sake, canned sake, box sake, and sparkling sake.  What does that all mean?  I really don't know since I'm not a big sake connoisseur.  However, I do recommend you try it at least once to experience it.    Along with your sake tasting, Taiko offers happy hour dishes that are super affordable.  This doesn't mean their food quality sucks.  It means it's cheap and good!  This was the first place I ordered a fried fish head.   Yep, eyes and lip still attached.  Needless to say, I'm in love with this dish.  If you don't know the tenderest meat comes from the cheeks.  Also, I was a virgin to Uni until I came to Taiko.  My first taste of Uni, well let's just say it was like my first kiss; awkward!  Can't say I'm a big fan of Uni, but if you put it in a shot of sake and quail eggs - we're golden!  Yum!  As you can see I go for the exotic ingredients.  Service here is tops.  Maggie and her staff is very friend and will treat you like family, literally.  Maggie is amazing since the time I first attended; she still remembers me by name and welcomes me!  During sake tastings they always have live entertainment.  Kevin one of the musical performers always brings along his violin or guitar to serenade you while you enjoy your sake and food.  Such an awesome atmosphere! - Enjoy!

(Lyric - Janet Jackson - Love Will Never Do (Without You)) Phoenix Palace I have tried before To replace as my Dim Sum place Never did I have a doubt It's Dim Sum I can't do without  They said it wouldn't last We had to prove them wrong Cause I've eaten in the past That hunger will always be without you  Phoenix Palace I have tried before To replace as my Dim Sum place Never did I have a doubt It's Dim Sum I can't do without I feel better after a meal with you Cause no other place around Has quite the same Yum Yum (ha ha ha!) Like you do do do do...  Phoenix Palace is an old school Dim Sum joint located in the heart of what I call little Chinatown.  Off Dobson and Warner this little corner in Chandler is a mecca for Asian businesses, aside from your LA Fitness on the Northwest corner.  Phoenix Palace is in the same corner as Lee Lee's Market; where you can explore all food ingredients from the Orient.    I'm a dim sum lover and I wish I could go every weekend, but that would totally destroy my diet!  Needless to say, Phoenix Palace is one of my favorite dim sum places in Phoenix.  They offer up some traditional products like Siu Mai, Nai Wong Bao, Phung Chows, and Cha Sui Baos.  Moreover, they also have some newer products and I gather it's for the more American guest like fried noodles, fried rice and calamari.  All good, but some times I wish they would just stick with tradition.    Overall, the dim sum is pretty good and one of the best in my opinion of what we can get in Phoenix.  It'll get the job done as they say, but don't expect it to blow your mind away.  Service here has improved through the years and afterwards you can always stop by Lee Lee's to get your Asian groceries.  Just a skip and a hop away is a Boba place so you might as well get your entire Asian fix on and done! - Enjoy

I love the lakes!  Yes it's a lake in the desert!  Dragon Boat, Outrigger, and Marathons!  It's the place to do it.  Not sure about the fishing part, but I do see people fishing there.  What are they trying to catch hmmm??  I enjoy running there on a nightly basis and so should you.  South side is probably the most scenic, but not to say the North side is bad.  If you're a fellow photographer I would definitely recommend this place during the evenings :)

Good Chinese food is hard to find in PHX.  I finally found a place worth going to and proud to call myself Chinese again!  Nee House is a little hidden restaurant among a strip mall of nothingness.  Thankfully, somebody recommended this place to me.  At first sight I was hesitant.  Our waitress was a lovely woman whom sure knew how to sell and flatter the guest J.  The place reminded me of any good Chinese restaurants back in LA YUM!  Décor wasn't much to be wow'd but I didn't expect much.  Okay back to the food; you gotta order from the Chinese menu; not to say the "Gwy-lo" menu is not good.  Soup for your appetizers is a must mmmm.  Funny, I wouldn't know what the dish I order is called in plan English; I sure knew how to order it in Chinese haha!  Sorry friends if you're curious: I suggest you go and try it - definitely worth your travel.  Enjoy!

Every now and then my Vietnamese side craves for PHO...are you surprised!?  Noodle Ranch is my local Pho joint.  I can literally walk to this place :)  Okay, the Pho Tai is great here....I got the combination once and it wasn't as good.  I love the decor here lots and lots of old photos of Vietnam.  Service is always good here and I've been here when their busy and when it's slow.  If you need a Pho fix I would definitely recommend this place!

The wings are freakin hot!!!  I enjoy my wings with some kick but man I must inform you; if you can't handle the heat stay away from the wings!  I had to gargle some warm water to get my taste buds back.  Haaaa! More water please and extra ice!  The burgers is a must -- nice cheesy and the beef was just right and moist.  Our bartender was down right chill and made you feel at home.  Ambience is your typical sports bar scene.  Shorts, T-Shirts, and Flip Flops are welcomed. - Enjoy!

Korean BBQ -- Warning while attending and eating Korean BBQ please dress appropriately!  After effects may include - full belly, the need to use a toothpick, flush face (especially when you're Asian), and YOU SMELL LIKE YOU JUST ATE SOME KOREAN BBQ comments!  I should have known, but I enjoy putting on a nice blazer -- that now needs to go to the cleaners.  Moving on, Korean BBQ is a small mom-pop shop.  The name of the restaurant got to the point and no beating around the bushes here.  You get what you order.  Grill your beef strips and pork fat yourself!  Hmm ain't nothin' like some pork fat over some Hite & OB beer -- Soju doesn't hurt either, but make sure you can handle yourself after a few rounds.  Overall, the food was pretty good and authentic here. Service was lovely and our waitress started the grilling for me and showed me the tools and tricks. Yes, my friends I'm not much of a cook even in front of a grill.  As I said early Korean BBQ is a small shop with some basic decor.  They have a full bar, but I didn't take advantage of it since I was busy trying to grill haha! They seem to have a karaoke room that was empty.  Not sure if they have karaoke nights, but let me know and I'll bust out my Bruno Mars impression! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Red Hot Chili Peppers - Under The Bridge)  It's hard to believe That there's no good Chinese food It's hard to believe That I'm so hungry At least I have her food The cafe she loves me Bo Bites as I am Together we try  I don't ever want to feel Like I did that day Take me to the place I love Take me all the way  (Asian Cafe Express!) Is where I ate some rice (Asian Cafe Express!) I could not get enough (Asian Cafe Express!) Don't forgot about my spice! (Asian Cafe Express!) I had to Yelp away..........  Cheap good Chinese style cuisine from all parts of the China!  Sha-wha!? No it's Shu Mai stupid!  Anyways, came here with 6 friends and we were going to do it the hard way; everyone order something, but instead we saw the Family Style Dinners.  They had every region: Hong Kong, Northern, Szechuan, and even Spicy!  Not sure where the spicy region came from, but we decided against it this time around since one of my buddies is wimp when it comes to spice.  Along with the Family style comes with fried rice, white rice, and chow mein.  Our 5 sides we order were XO Beef, Mapo Tofu, Fried Tofu, Calamari, and the last dish was Chicken, but not sure what it was called!  My bad peeps!    Overall my favorite was the XO Beef and Calamari.  Just enough spice on the beef dish while the calamari was perfectly seasoned and breaded to a crunch munch!  Service was friendly and fast, but the place was definitely a dive!  In the end, the bill came to about $50 for 6 people, but we couldn't even finish -- Fail! - Enjoy!

St. Francis's comin' down across Central Avenue Upon Happy Hour I'll drink and wish I'm in a parade Light of a fire grill Chef cooks with a thrill Coming at you on the count of 1,2,1,2,3,4! (number of drinks - wink!)  This is St. Francis Restaurant and you better try it out Succulent Pork Chops that your momma talked about King of the flatbreads And I'm here to have a meal The Chile Verde in my belly in this fine establishment  It's the patron saint of the appetite With an angel face and a taste for great serviced foods! (Lyrics - Green Day - St. Jimmy)  As I said this over and over; I don't know St. Francis, but I love this place.  Maybe that's why he's a saint.  This place rocks!    The place itself is a rustic homey feel that has an open kitchen.  Reminds me of spring time in a farm.  It's really relaxed and chill.  There's a nice patio to the East with a fire place and upstairs is another level of dining.  Complimentary valet which is recommended.  I ordered the Pork Chile Verde which came with a side of corn bread.  This pork was perfectly braised and fell apart perfectly into the chile sauce.  It is pretty spicy so if you can't handle the heat -- well like they said go get yourself a beer! Right!?  My partner ordered the Pork Chops --- she didn't go wrong there.  It was perfectly done; moist in the middle and succulent!  We both shared the Goat Cheese Bites and man it hit the spot.  Nice, warm, and creamy; along with the crunchy crostini -- mmm!  Service overall was a delight!  Very knowledgeable and their recommendations was spot on making our night one to remember.  St. Francis is a gem and was voting best new restaurant when they first opened back in 2010.  Ever since then their awards and accolades resonate well once you try this place out. - Enjoy!

I enjoy a cup of Boba every now and then.  Back in college it was an up and coming hot thing.  So Starbucks vs. Boba was a daily debate.  Boba Tea House - wow what an original name!  Yeahhhhh...... As usual my boba selection was off the charts?  Why so much flavor man?  I only and always get the Thai Tea with Boba....might as well call it "Bo's" Ba ... :)  Service was easy going and I get my tea the way I want it.  However, what's up with the A/C?  They have fans blowing left and right?  Does making Boba take that much power that you have to switch off the A/C? or does the salt water tank with the fish need to be at a certain temp?  They have a leather couch, but no thanks I like the skin on my legs where they are.  Not sure what's up, but I bet all their workers can't wait till the winter season - enjoy!

(Lyrics - The Lumineers - Ho Hey)  Cho! Dang! Cho! Dang!  (Cho!) I've been trying Bo Bite it right (Dang!) I've been trying to eat right (Cho!) I've been craving here instead (Dang!) I've been craving tofu soup (Cho!) I've been craving tofu soup (Dang!)  (Cho!)  (Cho!) So show me a Korean dish (Dang!) All the food that I will eat (Cho!) I don't know where to start (Dang!) I don't know where I went hungry (Cho!) But I can write a song (& Review) (Dang!)  1, 2, 3 I will Chodang with you, you Chodang with me, in my sweet belly! I Chodang with you, you Chodang with me, in my sweet! (Cho!)  Cho!  Dang, has been a staple Korean restaurant for some time for many Chandler folks.  I've never lived in Chandler, but I never mind making my journey south to come here.  I generally wait till the weather gets a little cooler before coming to Chodangs because I always order their Tofu Soup.    They used to serve their rice in a stone bowl, but not particularly sure why they stopped.  Probably because some idiot kept burning themselves (thanks for ruining it for all of us!)  Anyways, I totally recommend this traditional dish if you haven't tried it yet!  Especially, on a "cold winter" day in the valley.  I would go with the #2 which has oysters, shrimp, and beef all in one.  Plus, I recommend including the egg when they as if you want them to add it for you!  Nice hot broth cooking the egg with a bowl of steaming white rice!  Perfect for any winters day!  It would kick any cold out of the way!  In the end, Chodangs great if you can handle some spice and pungent smell of Korean food.  I would consider this place one of the best in town! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Peter Cetera - Glory of Love) Today it's very clear, as we're both eating here,  there's so many things I want to try I will always review it, I will never leave you alone.   Sometimes I just forget, try things I might regret,  just break the eggs and I'll have it over easy.  I don't want to lose the yolk,  I could never eat it alone  I am a foodie who will try all your dishes, I can give you a review you're dreaming of.  We'll brunch forever, knowing together  that we ate it at the Morning Glory Cafe!  Morning Glory Cafe is one of the gems hidden in South Phoenix area.  It's literally a huge garden and picnic area.  Perfect for a day outing with the family and friends.  I usually go after a hike at South Mts. since its right down the street or around the area.  Walking past the picnic area and organic gardens you wouldn't think you're actually in Phoenix; except if it's super hot out!    Brunch!  My favorite meal of the day when I can get it!  This time around I ordered their Eggs Benedict, which they called the Morning Glory Benedict.  Poached eggs, spinach, and ham on two muffins with hollandaise sauce; seems pretty simple, but damn I love it!  Also free self serving lemonade and ice tea -- load up!    There's something about having brunch right outside over viewing the farm and picnic like scenery.  It's relaxing yet you feel connected with the natural setting.  Someone pinch me.....Ouch!  Okay back to my office....sigh!    Needless to say, Morning Glory Cafe, if I could sing like Peter Cetera that's my anthem to you.  The place is sweet and cute.  No mimosas this time around, but look for me on the next round! - Enjoy!

This is a gym goer's gym.  Serious people only; not your Fufu trying to pick up on someone, I can't get away from looking at the mirror, hey what's your name gym!  You need to get your "donkey" back in shape you come to Rehab Plus.  No bull!  Warren and his boys will get you working and performing at a new level.  I got killed climbing the ropes.  I didn't think much of it, but how dare I underestimated it!  My arms were so weak and tired in the end.  My hands.....well let's just say calling them raw is an understatement.  I don't recall how many times I climbed that rope and did pull-ups, but yeah it was hell of a workout.  That was just my first time too!  Can't wait to go back........hahahaha!  I laugh because I just realize how ridiculous this is!  Here I come Tough Mudder!    The gym doesn't have all the high tech equipment.  You want that; go to a gym where they offer manicures!  Suck it up and welcome to hell!  Basic equipment, but very innovative technics and training.  They have an artificial turf area and a free weights room where looking at it makes you feel a lot bigger.  Are those really my biceps -- wink!

(Lyrics - The Outfield - Your Love )  Sushi's in Phoenix is far away Come around to Hana and talk it over So many dishes that I wanna try You know I like my sushi a little bit colder  I just want some yakisoba tonight I'm going to Hana Japanese Eatery tonight  I got so many reviews to get to Always got to write when I'm hungry You know I'd do anything for food Stay and eat and have a belly covered  I just want some yakisoba tonight I'm going to Hana Japanese Eatery tonight  Hana Japanese Eatery is located on 7th Ave. south of Bethany Home Rd. in a tiny outdated strip mall.  At first glance, it doesn't look like much and out of all places a sushi joint is here!  Needless to say once you walk in the place is cozy with a hip mom & pop feel.  It's definitely dark in here, but that lounge cool feel is hot right now so I can't complain.    I'm not a big sushi eater, but my friend ordered some and thought it was pretty good.  I'll have to agree since I only took one bite.  What I ordered was amazing!  Ebi Yakisoba noodles they served here was wonderful.  There was something about the sauce that they mixed.  I asked the waitress, but apparently its chef secret.  That extra sweet after taste left in my mouth is unforgettable, but I can only say it's similar to a kimchi sweetness without the spice.  Definitely one of the best yakisobas I had in a while and that's what's going to keep me coming back since I can't figure out what's in that sauce!  Darn the food gods!  Why must to toil with my palates! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - The Beatles - Hey Jude)  Hey Joe, don't make it bad Take a salad and make it better Organic to make it healthy for my heart Then you can start to make my burger  Hey Joe, don't be afraid I was made to go out and Yelp you The minute you let try your onion rings Then I begin to feel a lot better  And anytime I feel hungry pains, hey Joe's Farm Grill Please carry some fries and bacon burgers For well you know that it's Bo Bites who eats and sings By making your world a little tastier Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah   It's Joe's from Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives!  Yes, this sweet spot has been around for some times and always a pleasure to visit.  Service here is always on spot and just having the ability to walk around the yard is fun.  The Coffee Shop next doors bakes up a storm and the farmers market is always cool to explore.    I came to Joe's after a run with a friend so we were pretty hungry!  I went for the Fontina Burger with Onion Rings, while she ordered the Ahi Sandwich with Beets.  My burger was cooked to perfection while the peppers and fontina cheese gave it a lovely sweet pop.  I would say they have the softest bun around and it just literally melts in your mouth.  The Onion rings were fresh and crunchy with every bite.  My friends Ahi Sandwich had the same bun, but within was a large slab of tuna with some slaw.  Overall, a crunchiness of the slaw gave it some texture while the wasabi mayo provided some heat.  The tuna itself was cooked lightly seared so you had somewhat of a sashimi taste to it.    In the end, Joe's Farm Grill is always a recommendation whenever someone ask me about a great place to eat.  The experience itself is always great because of the atmosphere it has and the food is always consistent! - Enjoy!

Nice location - okay food.  This place took over ChopSticks according to a friend and kept some of the decor ha! I can dig - recycle!  ChopSticks to Juan Jaime's?? Go figure!  Food was decent I'm not bashing it but if I can order the same at the Baja Fresh com'on!  They have great happy hour prices and for a long time too 4pm to 8pm!  Service was lacking....and the place can get kinda loud...what? I said LOUD!  I think if you're hanging with the boys tonight for happy hour I would recommend this place -- otherwise go elsewhere for food.

Not sure if I should dirty or pretty when I'm done leaving.  I appreciate seeing a group of people of all kinds having fun here.  No dresscodes to kick you out or cover charge is always a plus.  Bartending in aisle 9 needs assistance! Um yeah I need a drink please....!  Service was alright, but their bar space is limited.  Let's dance....oh wait - the dance floor can get packed and limited too....well I guess I'll bob my head like the doll.  Don't get me wrong I dig the place; it's just small.  The have a great location in S. Scottsdale.  Walking distance to the next club or bar is always favorable -- enjoy!

I'm not a big fan of pasta, but I can't say this would be a place I would pick it I were.  Food is alright, I wouldn't be running and knocking anybody over for it.  I've had pizzas, sandwiches, and pastas here, but it just doesn't seem to come with a bang.  The decor is obviously, old luncheon New York style, but nothing too fancy for sure - bada bing!  Service is a rush here; I understand the place gets pretty packed, but can you slow down a tad bit and listen.  Oh yeah, the place can get pretty loud too!  Overall - the rating "I've definitely experienced better!"

This joint is pretty cool.  I'm surprised it's in such a location and they definitely have to deal with competition @ Zipps across street.  However, this place is a nice place to hang with your buds for a drink or two...or three....you get the point.  Surf boards and Rock is the atmosphere.  I took off my bear label and stuck it on the wall.  Look for it, I had the Landshark Lager :)  I dig any place with live music; though this place was quaint and small they had band setup which was in your face, but classic rock is classic rock --- sweet!

Gotta give it to the Earl of Sandwiches!  They make one damn good sandwich hands down!  They claim to be the best hot sandwich in the world.  I don't know who does the voting but they got mines.  I ordered the Original, which was pretty much a roast beef sandwich.  Warm roast beef with cheddar and horseradish sauce - pretty simple, but this sandwich gots pop!  I think what really got me was the crusty bread, which I believe is Ciabatta, but more in a hoagie style.  Again, I'm a texture guy warm soft roast beef and cheese inside a crusty bread -- you get the point.    This place always seem to have a line whether for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night eats.  So don't be surprised just embrace since you'll know where to go eat at 4am in the morning stumbling around; "go with the crowd and don't get lost"!  - Enjoy!

I can dig the BBQ here.  Food was pretty good and portions were just right.  I appreciate the wide selection of BBQ items, but I only ordered two - half CK & Pull Pork and they were both good.  Decor is alright, but I've definitely seen a better BBQ joint or I guess I should say more southern style-like.  It's a chain and I gotta give them a break - "A" for effort.  I really like the porch style seating, but really wonder what it's like during the hot summers hmmm...just makes me skirm when I think about eating and sweating at the same time - Yuck!  I gotta make a come back to taste the rest of the BBQ items for sure!  So if you're craving for some BBQ hit me up! :)

(Lyrics - Ne-Yo - Because of You)  Want to but I can Yelp it, I love the way it tastes Just got my drinks and getting ready for what is my meal I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't Tell myself I'll stop by every day knowing that I will  If you're really hungry and I  know what to do about it Even if you're not I know I am, and I wouldn't doubt it I'm taken by the thought of it  And I know this much is true Roka, you have become my addiction I'm so hungry for you, I can barely move But I like it and it's at Roka Akor  (at Roka Akor) And it's at Roka Akor (at Roka Akor) And it's at Roka Akor (at Roka Akor) And it's at Roka Akor  Hearth of Fire?  Roka Akor is a Robatayaki Japanese restaurant located in the middle of Scottsdale.  Not too north and not too south; off Scottsdale Road and Indian Bend.   The word ROKA is actually two words from the Japanese language.  RO meaning hearth and KA meaning fire.  Robatayaki is a traditional Japanese barbarque concept, where food is cooked in front of customers and served.  Okay, enough with the educational part.  Let's get to the fun part.  Eating & drinking!  What can I say, or should I sing?  Les poisson les poisson how I love les poisson Love to chop and to serve little fish (Chef Louis from The Little Mermaid)  I always order from the Bar where they have offer the small plates.  Their Sake and Shochu Lounge menu is a must and very affordable.  My favorite, the fishys'!  Their Butterfish Tataki with white Asparagus and Yuzu is mmm good; yes chopped little poisson in my belly - Yum!  The fish itself is soft and melts in your mouth and the asparagus adds the crunch you need to balance out the texture.  The Yuzu sauce is sweet and sour.  Other favorites I must mention is the Chibi Burger, Sweet Corn Tempura, and Roast Duck with Kimchi Udon. Finally, the star of the night has to be the Mushroom Hot Pot --- Uhh! I'm not a vegan by any means, but if I get to eat this daily I'll consider it! A combination of 3 mushrooms and soft sticky rice served in a stone pot; the aroma of the mushrooms cover the rice, while providing a sweet warm creamy blanket to your palates. Yummy!  By the way, do you need to impress a date?  Well look no further!  Roka Akor will definitely wow your significant other!   The place itself is eye candy!  Sweet in my belly and sweet for my eyes; can't complain.  Presentations of the dishes are no laughing matter either.  I think I enjoy taking pictures of the food here more then most places.  Overall, a must visit for happy hour or to tell your date you're serious and you play with the big boys of the food world. - Enjoy!  (Food Porn by Ms. Suzen Tang on Instagram -- ssuze)

She's got the motion from the ocean to cure my sushi craving ills -- Sushi Eye's got --- SKILLS!    A modern twist with a belt rolling by with sushi -- Sushi Eye's got --- SKILLS!  A little wasabi with my sushi --- Sushi Eye's got --- SKILLS!  Yum Yum, eat'em up, think I'm in luck because - Sushi Eye in Motion got me singing some R&B pop!  I always enjoy hangin' in downtown Chandler.  The place doesn't get much respect around the valley, but it's definitely a growing hot spot.  I totally dig my sushi on a belt rolling by so that I can EYE the different selections.  My visit however, ended at the table where I ordered some Orange Blossom roll and Sushi Eye signature roll -- Yum indeed!  Service was awesome and the ambience is a totally modern, swanky, and hip! - Enjoy!

Well we are goin' to the Rose and Crown and there's nothing you can do Oh Yes we're on our way  And theres nothing you can do So we are goin' to the Rose and Crown and have a few brews!  We don't refer to the menu When showing up we just order (fish and chips) Our generation gap Means we prefer them with ketchup The drinks is getting to your head The drinks is in my hands! (Lyrics - The Living End - Prisoner of Society)  The Rose and Crown is located across from Pizzaeria Bianco and next to Nobuo's Teeter House.  Aside from Bar Bianco I think this place would be great as you wait the lines of these two great restaurants.    The Rose and Crown is a Pub, also known as a public bar.  Public bar?  Aren't all bars public?  Well grasshopper, according to the "internet", in the UK, many hotels have bars that are generally private to their guest.  Thus, the invention of public bars known as Pubs.  Now, back to Phoenix!  The Rose and Crown offers up a plethora of beers in pints, bottles, or 20oz.  Needless to say you're options will get your head spinning.  I stuck to my guns and went with a Stella - haha!  I also ordered off their menu -- whoops!  I shouldn't have referred their, but I did and went with the Fish and Chips; I'm in a pub, what do you expect!?  Overall, this was probably the best Fish and Chips I had.  The fish was moist in the inside and the bread crust around it was perfect and crispy.  I'm a texture guy when it comes to food and the Fish and Chips was a kick in the GOALLLLLLLLL!    Yes, soccer fans this place is a mecca of soccer decor and perfect for your next soccer outing, or should I say futbol?  I'm not much of a fan, but I sure know where to go the next world cup comes along. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - A Taste of Honey - Sukiyaki)  It's all because of you, I'm feeling good and full I went away, now I'm back for another day  And I love your rolls, how much you'll never know I'm back again and ordered noodles Untouchable memories, order some edamame Of taste so true  That it once turned my palates askew And my food disappeared Now my glass is filled with beer And I'm wishing you were here with me  Okay, Kabuki deserves my love!  This place has been here as long as I've been in PHX. At first it was a cliche restaurant, but now it's fast becoming a staple of Temple Marketplace.  I come here often usually for drinks for Happy Hour and Reverse. Sake bombs and saketini's just keep them flowing. The food has gotten a lot better as the years have passed. Not much of a sushi guy I always say so I order their noodle dishes. Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura, Mori Soba, and my favorite Spicy Seafood Udon Pasta. The Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura for me is just a filler. The Mori Soba is definitely a summer dish for me since it's cold buckwheat noodles in a soy dipping sauce. The udon noodles is perfect -- from shrimp, mussels, and scallops with what I believe is mixed in some XO sauce -- an Asian spicy sauce. Definitely will kick some behind if you like it spicy.  Overall, the food is good and the drinks are a must in my book. Service is always on top of their game and never fails. Needless to say, Kabuki you lost me once, but now I'm back! - Enjoy!

X O Lent!  No! I don't mean the cognac! First off, food was great.  I don't know what "real" Jamaican food taste like or look like, but I gather it's similar to what I ate or hope it is :)  This is a small place so if you want to try it out go during the weekday like I did.  It's a BYOB restaurant so like your best friends NFL gathering bring what you want to drink - though unlike your friends gathering they'll charge you for what you bring, but the price is not bad...really!  Our server tonight was on top of it.  I give this place 2 thumbs up!

Yen Sushi is a cute little mom and pop sushi joint.  I came with my family for a quick bite of lunch.  Overall, decors were modern Japanese with some nice artwork hanging from the walls.  The place was pretty dark, but I gather they were shooting for cool modern sushi bar look.  My cousin ordered their shrimp udon noodles and my brother-in-law and I shot for their Bento box; he got the short ribs and me I got the spicy pork.  Along with the Bento came miso soup, steamed rice, tempura vegetables, Japanese salad, and some spicy tuna roll.  Everything was pretty much basic as for the spicy pork; definitely could have used a little more kick to it.  My brother-in-law's short rib was probably a better bet.  We both felt it had more flavors than the pork.  My cousin said her udon noodles were good at best.    In the end, Yen Sushi looks like a little hot spot for patrons close by.  I think overall it's good enough, but Bento box for $9 is not a bad deal at all!  Based on what I've heard the sushi here is great so next we shall come by together and see! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Queen - We Are The Champions)  I've come to eat Time after time I've done my research I've committed to try  And bad reviews I've made a few I've had my share of bad taste in my mouth But I've come through  (And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)  La Bocca Pizzeria and Bo Bites And we'll keeping on eating till the end La Bocca Pizzeria La Bocca Pizzeria No time for choosers Cause La Bocca Pizzeria is on Mills....  One of the hottest spots on Mill Ave. La Bocca Urban Pizzeria has been a favorite of mines for years.    All ingredients are locally grown and served with love.  My partner and I came around 10pm on a weeknight so the place was pretty calm.  We sat at the bar and ordered their Antipasti plate and Bocca Trio pizza along with a bottle of wine. Our bartender was lovely enough to let us have taste of our choice of wine before making our final decision.  Something light and not too acidic was on our palates tonight.  To start antipasti was pretty good with your usual, salami, prosciutto, cheese, and olives and my favorite the elephant roasted garlic - thank goodness I wasn't planning to kiss anyone that night!  The pizza was darn good!  Anything with 3 meats is good right!? Atop with sausage, pepperoni, salami with roasted tomatoes, and 2 different cheese; mozzarella and fontina.  The dough was soft and the marinara sauce was aromatic and hot helping keep the ingredients warm and fresh to the taste.  The service was top notch overall and the ambiance is perfect for a lovely evening of wine and dine; plus if you don't want to break the bank.  The place had a classic decor feel with a modern twist and uptown look.  A plus side in my books! - Enjoy!

I must say they really spruce this place up.  Makes my Vietnamese food taste better too I think :)  Not to say I dislike hole in walls, but Ao Sen really paid attention to their decors.  To the food!  We ordered an appetizer to start - had coconut milk and noodles, forgot what it was called, but like my friend said; "can you go wrong with coconut milk."  I order a #29 - I don't speak or read Viet, but it sure tasted dandy!  I was trying to be different and not order the "PHOnomenal" - maybe it was the feel of the place; it just didn't make me really want PHO.  Anyways, #29 was a pork/beef lettuce noodle wrap - fun and yum!  Chances or return very high...enjoy!

I always appreciate and support small own businesses!  Mido is no different.  I don't eat much Sushi, but when I'm hanging with Ms. Tang seems like we always do Sushi.  I don't do the ordering since I'm such a novice Sushi patron so I eat whatever she orders.  Tonight - White Tuna Albacore, Octopus, Shrimp Roll w it's head fried, Squid Salad, miso soup, edamame, and my nemesis Uni!  I can't handle Uni -- the texture really throws me off and the taste of the ocean from a slimy gushy slab of Sea Urchin is not fun for my palate!  Everything else works, definitely loving the Octopus with a thinly slice of lemon on top - Yum!  Plus, gotta say my all time favorite is the fried shrimp head -- Yes, Andrew Zimmerman would be proud of me.  Service was excellent.  I got a tip of the hat from the Sushi Master -- I hope that's a good thing.  Overall they were attentive and quick.  The decors were traditional Japanese and what you would expect from a small sushi joint.  Definitely, think an anime flare would do it some good haha!  Dragon Ball Z, Gundam, and some Escaflowne would give it some up to date generational kick! - Enjoy!

I've eaten before, but tonight was just a social mixer. Let's start off with the obvious; Food...like the 2 stars headed "Meh. I've experienced better"  I feel like they try to wow you with the portions and the extra side of garnish with your burrito or what they call a burrito...  Really!? How about giving me something that taste good!  Service - no complaints, time and time again Maria Maria has showed me some Love Love.  The place is pretty swanky, low lights and nice decors of Santana's cover artwork.  Live music on Friday & Saturday nights, but you best hope it's not some rock band cause the place can get loud - wha? - yes LOUD!

It's a love hate thing -- I don't eat much sushi, but I can't help when everyone else does.  So I generally end up at a sushi joint.  I can say as a non-sushi eating person - I enjoyed Blue Wasabi.  I think it's the "blue wasabi" that makes it so special.  Drinks here are a tad bit pricey, but I've never been here for happy hour nor "Special Blue Days" -- I guess if you wear a blue shirt on certain days; you get a discount -- makes sense.  Service is okay, but shouldn't their uniforms be blue?  Maybe the Blue Sailor Moon!!?? Wow I got an idea! :) - Enjoy!

Nice restaurant in Kierland!  I like their setup; modern and contemporary feel. They have a decent size patio which extends around the building - smart! Always makes the place looks hoping even with no one inside.  Happy Hour is decent 1/2 glasses of wine and some appetizers.  I ordered their pizza and at first I wasn't sure by looking at it, but rest assure...it's damn good!  I just wish it this place wasn't so far "NoRth" -- har har, if it was just tad bit closer I wouldn't mind attending often

I usually don't write a lot about chain restaurants, but this particular Z'Tejas deserves one from me!  I think over Z'Tejas serves up some good eats in general.  I particularly love their cheese dip in their nacho cheese and chip appetizer.  Warm, creamy, and cheesy along with some guacamole pop; great start to the night and I would totally recommend.  They're known for their margaritas, but I felt like a beer so didn't have a chance, but definitely next time!    For entrees my friend and I shot for the Salmon salad, fajitas, and for myself I ordered the Smothered Chicken Burrito.  I rather enjoyed my burrito filled with rice, chicken, cheese, and doused with warm red chile sauce.    However, the love I give here is because of their service.  We had a party of 11 and they did their best to accommodate us on a busy night; even having a server come out to the front of the building taking our drink orders.  Service did not slack all night and that's what I appreciate; plus they were knowledgeable about their food.  I've worked in the food industry all my life and in the end there's never excuses just get it right and Z'Tejas Paradise Valley did! - Enjoy!

Reviews of this place were pretty decent on Yelp, but I thought this place was pretty good.  Granted, I gather it's not as authentic as some other Indian restaurants; this place still holds it's own.  Maybe it's the spice level?  Well needless to say your food should only be so spicy.  My Masala CK's spice was perfect for me.  I can handle a few peppers, but I must say too much is ridiculous - milk please!  The ambience is neat.  The fresh green wall on the bar really brightens the joint and the wine lined up to the top of the ceiling is a great design call.  Our service was okay and that's all I'll say - Enjoy!

Downtown Chandler is definitely a hidden hot spot!  Latitude Eight is one reason why you should come by.  I love Thai food and Lat 8 fills my stomach with love!  They bring out that Thai flare and integrate American plating.  Ambience is trendy and sleek, definitely a date spot my friends.  Service was top notch - our waitress was funny and on top of things.  My food was nice and hot when it came and nice and gone soon after.  I appreciate a place that can take fried rice and bring it to the next level - try their Pineapple Fried Rice --- YUM! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Neil Diamond - Sweet Caroline)  Where to begin, I can begin with milkshakes But then I know my appetite is growing strong  Start with a scoop And the scoop became a double Who'd have believed it came along  Hot.....fudge sundaes..... Reaching out, trying it, tasting it......  Sweet Republic (bop bop bop) Good times never seemed so good I'd be inclined (bop bop bop) To believe it never would Now Bo Bites.....   How shall I start!  I love Ice Cream!?   Well let's just say I'm one to have a sweet spot for some good ice cream!  Sweet Republic has that covered ladies and gents.  With funky flavors such as Kulfi, Jalapeno Avocado Bacon Brittle, Basil Lime Sorbet, etc.  Sweet Republic has 2 locations I hope this little ice cream boutique grows, even though the Shea location is close enough for me to visit more often than not.  However, my gut and love handles say NO MORE!  My mouth and eyes say just a small bite of Waffle cones and 2 more flavors!  They also serve up some interesting milkshakes and sundaes, which I can't wait to try!  Your ice cream could be served up in a waffle cone, cup, and even between 2 cookies of your choice!   I came here on a hot summer day and ordered the waffle cone with Salted Caramel Butter and Belgium Chocolate.  I'm not too crazy for the exotic flavors; like to keep things simple.  Sweet and buttery ice cream slow oozing down my cone as I embrace every bite and lick.....gee I think I just had a foodgasm!  Overall, the place is very welcoming like most ice cream shops.  It can get real crammed up in this shop since seating is limited, but lets just hope you beat out the crowd.  In the end, Sweet Republic's reputation is definitely well deserved and a must visit! - Enjoy

Yep 2 stars my friends.  I think this place gets the go simply because of the location.  Great place to put a restaurant let's just say - right outside the entrance to the theaters.  Other than that I'm not too impressed.  Food was edible and that's all I'll say, but nothing that really stuck out.  I guess I'm being too harsh, but I'm a food snob - I have the rights! :)  Decor is interesting.  They try to get the old pub feel, quite comfy and cozy but it's just not the same without snow - oh PHX!  However, I've been to a more interesting Irish pub up north called the skeptical chymist - and definitely more fun.  Service was kind and upbeat, which I expected from restaurants in Tempe Market Place.  Gosh, can you imagine that crowd they deal with!  - Enjoy!

Cause of their bottomless fries!  Need I say more?  I enjoy a good burger and as weird as it sounds Red Robins always seem to satisfy my appetite.  My favorite so far is the Guacamole Burger with bacon --- yum!  Always done right!  The place itself is a zoo with a carnival on the side; babies crying and kids running amuck.  If you can't handle that then I say please stay away!  I always hangout at the bar where there are no kids allowed; good call!  The drinks here are pretty basic and each wait staff has their specialty drink you can order -- cool!  This location is a tad bit noisier I feel since it is closer to the ASU crowd and I gather it's more family oriented because of the marketplace.  Oh well it's just for a quick bite! - Enjoy!

I rather enjoyed this place.  Owner is totally cool dude and was kind to have remembered me from my one visit months ago - impressive indeed.  The atmosphere is really really interesting.  Really chill obviously :)  I'm not a big hookah smoker, but enjoy it every now and then.  I've notice a lot of people complained about the price...okay..sure.  I say you pay for the location and ambience of the place.  Definitely a return for me :)

Duke Duke Duke  Duke of Fail Duke Duke Duke of Fail  I would say this place was my type of bar 10 years ago, but now in my early 30's I need something more up to date.  This place is huge and has a decent patio.  Table to video games in every room.  Nostalgic sports awards to basic sport memorabilia hangs along the ways with advertisement of alcohol.  Large TV screens here and there with random channels playing.    I just didn't get a good feel about this place.  Drinks seem pretty affordable here, but the food wasn't too impressive.  We ordered the burger with fries, artichoke dips and jalapeño poppers.  I didn't eat the burger, but the fries were stale.  Ever ate fries that were in the freezer too long and the left in frying oil that needed to be changed?  Yeah it tasted like that.  The artichoke dips seemed like it came out of a box.  It didn't have much taste and the only thing I ate was the tortilla chips.  Finally the poppers were probably the "best" of the night between the dishes.  Nice and creamy once you bit into it and crispy on the outside.    Overall, serve was good since we were the only large group of people in there.  If you live close by and need a drink I would recommend this place.  However, the immature crowd and poor karaoke music doesn't make we want to stay too long. - Enjoy!

I like good Pho and I cannot lie!  You brothers and sistas can't deny.  When the broth is steamin and the sides are fresh, you get sprung!  You wanna pull up a chair, cuz you know it's stuffed with noodles, deep in that bowl their servin'.  I'm hooked, cause I can't stop eating.  Oh baby, I wanna take some home; along with some spring rolls.  My homeboy tried to warn me, but that Pho's got mememe so hungry! - Enjoy!

I'm quite impressed with The Dhaba.  It's a little small restaurant surrounded in what is called the India Plaza in Tempe.  Truthfully, I can't pronounced what we ordered, but it was damn good.  My friend ordered some Marsala that was pretty awesome -- which I can at least say Marsala haha!  Overall the food was a excellent!  Service was okay and quick, however the CC issue kinda got to me when they couldn't charge 2 -- Yes 2 different CC correctly.  Ambience was probably my favorite.  The decors where pretty authentic I gathered and felt like I was transformed to a time -- where all storys start with "Long Ago".  Metal plates and water cups, what shall we sacrifice next har har!

My new favorite sports bar.  I've heard about RT's but never came.  Finally, my visit here is well received.    Came after a fight night, but apparently they show the fight here too.  Plus, all the NFL games.  Service was not at it's best, but maybe because we sat in the patio.  The place definitely had the Irish sports bar feel and look.  The men's restroom was interesting, but let me tell you about the women's restroom.  I was invited in because my gal pal said I had too see this.  Needless to say there's a huge Troll looking back at you in the mirror -- totally awesome, but spooky.    Why do I like this joint?  Dancing drunk old man and the drinks are cheap.  Take a shot of whiskey to warm yourself in the patio and enjoy your company. - Enjoy!

I gotta say The Keg is definitely one of my favorite steak franchises.  Food is always good and the steak is done to perfection.  Along with a bottle wine, good company and you're good for the night.  Gotta come back and try out all their appetizers and next time - yes on dessert please :)  The ambience is very classy and low key.  Dim lighting and quiet murmurs hmmm?   Service is top and quick.  I like my steak with a smile :)

Vigor's of Tuscany.....and grill...eh! Eh! ....oooh  Lazy Sunday after missing the movies since I didn't want to stand in line. Attended this place since I heard great things about their HH -- I had no Vigor in me this day so HH sounded awesome.  However, no HH on Sunday!  Errrr -- well I was not dissatisfied.  We order some drinks and appetizers.  I had the Raspberry Mojito -- definitely cooled me down!  We ordered some Calamari and guess what the star of the dish wasn't even the Calamari -- the fried peppercini peppers did it for us.  So we had a special request for just that and guess what -- they obliged - Thumbs Up!  My friend ordered the Steak Bruschetta's and I don't remember her eating it....just saw the empty board haha!   We said outside on the bar patio with the misters while people watching.  Service was great and the drinks flowed.  What can I say; I'm coming back for HH next time. - Enjoy!

Oochie wild wild (flower) Oochie bread bread.....(company)  This place is always popping with patrons during lunch. I would say one of the healthier choices when it comes to eating out. I always order their half sandwich and half soup deal. Love the French Onion and the Potato Cream soups. As for the sandwich I dig them all. The portions are just right for me and truthfully just right for most of us.  Quality over quantity is what I preach; so quit stuffing your face until you feel like you need to pop (SEVEN - Ouch!).   The place has outdoor seating except I wouldn't sit there since traffic around the complex is pretty hectic.  All that dust flying around means extra salt in my diet I guess.  Indoor seating is recommended, but during lunchtime -- good luck finding a seat. I wish the place would expand! - Enjoy!

Nice little Mexican joint in North Scottsdale - puff puff pass please wink!  Literally, just pass.  Parking is limited for such large place so I wonder what happens during rush hour, or maybe they didn't expect any rush!  The food - tacos, nachos, chimichungas, etc....nothing too impressive, but I can't say I was dissatisfied.  I didn't expect much so I wasn't too disappointed.  I ordered a couple of drinks and maybe I should have ordered more to drown out the sorrow of this experience!  Our service was good at least I can say, but then again we were one of the two customers around :(  - Enjoy...or not.

(Lyrics - Shakira - Loca) I'm hungry all the time Just to keep it fun To get you on like (Mmm!) Be careful amigo I'm writing and reviewing just to keep your appetite up You'd die for pasta But I'll start with drinks only, pleases  Sigo tranquila While I'm feasting in Arizona Sippin' my Corona Like it's nothin' goin' on I ain't leavin' you alone What is meant for me No other boy will review it So give it up  And I'm Yelping, but you like it noca noca noca You like with some stars please noca noca noca I'm Yelping but you like it noca noca noca Yelping but you like it  noca is located in the Northwest corner of 32nd St. and Camelback.  Kind of hidden, but this location seems like a hot spot for awesome restaurants (Central Bistro, Keegans, Delux, etc.)  noca is a seasonal restaurant which means their menus change like the 4 seasons.  Locally, purchase products allow them to seek the best to use at the time.  They've been awarded with several accolades from the culinary world so this is must visit being a foodie I am!  My first impression was noca was a little quiet during the weekdays and I've never attended during the weekend.  However, giving this place 4 stars means I'll probably stop on by to check it out again!  I started to order the spaghetti, but later a friend told me it was just the spaghetti; no protein.  Weird I thought cause I was thinking it would come with meatballs or meat sauce at least.  So I changed on a whim with no problems to the lamb fettuccini.  Whole wheat pasta! Yeah, it's a rare thing to see, but I get it the world is treading towards healthy eating and so am I!  I thought overall my pasta was pretty good.  I don't eat a lot of pasta, but gotta say this one gets an A!  Creamy and saucy this fettuccini makes me want more, but gotta control the carb intake!    Dessert was served compliments of noca!  Triple brownie and fresh made donuts with raspberry sauce.  noca you make me loca and need to dance like Shakira to burn all this off.  Guess it helps with a badonkadonk butt! - Enjoy!

This is the Macho Man Randy Savage!  Welcome to Christopher's Restaurant\CRrrrrrrush Lounge!  Oh Yeah! (To the late Macho Man Randy Savage!)  Christopher's Restaurant is actually far from the WWE.  I would say it has a lot more class and realism to it.  Located inside the Biltmore Fashion Park, Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge place is a hidden gem!  The restaurant itself is split into two areas, the restaurant and a lounge.    The restaurant area is very hip with a contemporary feel.  It has an open kitchen where renowned Chef Christopher Gross and his sous chefs create his master pieces in front of patrons.  Yes, it is a delight to see an artist at work!  I definitely recommend sitting at the restaurant bar once to meet all the chefs.    Crush lounge is the other half.  It's sexy and sleek.  Feel a bit naughty?  I hope I'm not the only after a visited to this bar!  The portraits on posted in front of the bar is very "mature audience" oriented.  If you can't handle the heat go to the restaurant; a lot more PG-13 on that end.  Crush lounge is an intimate area where you can enjoy your drinks and order some small bites.  The Crush lounge offers up cheese platters, pizzas, and some of your favorites from burgers to calamari.    The food from the restaurant half is a nothing less than great!  If your palate doesn't say wow then have checked out.  Might need an MRI and put on injure reserved list!  Chef Christopher offers everything from your basic burgers and pizza to fine dining cuisines like Foie Gra and Duck Confit!  Trust me you're losing out on anything if you order here.  Matter of fact you'll probably come back to try the rest! - Enjoy!

I like to climb things I've learned.  This place is a tad bit far me, but totally worth the drive.  Looks fun - is fun, looks hard - is hard :) I know you're not supposed to use your arms much while climbing, but damn when you're up that high you can't help but be a little afraid of falling.  Thus, clinching for dear life!  Needless to say my arms are sore :( This would be a great family gathering, but also if you're looking for a good workout with a twist - it's a must!  Thumbs way up!

Swanky looking place inside the W Hotel --- ooooh...ahhhhh!  Let's check out the exotic cars parked outside -- ooooooh...ahhhhh!   Let's try out the food............ ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... .....  Pretty cool place to hangout if I wanted to be seen with cool crowd I guess (my mom said I was cool....) I didn't think their sushi and rolls were to too exciting. I guess they had to please the crowd and what's hip and cool.  The only thing exotic is parked outside, not on the menu.  Pretty basic and mediocre at best. Nothing I haven't seen.   Service was good overall and attentive.  Ambience is like a lounge and smooth.  I felt like I back in Hollywood Blvd hanging at Katana's. - Enjoy

(Lyrics - Al Green - How Can You Mend A Broken Heart)  I can think of other places, when to have my lunch Was everything a Yelper could want to do I could always eat Vietnamese I was never told about their "Nam Nuong"  How can you mend a broken rice? How can I try the pork and eggrolls now? (tell me) How can you stop that fish sauce from flowing? What makes my world go round?   Com Tam Thuan Kieu I would say is best known for their broken rice entree.  I usually go for that before I even think about browsing the menu.    Secondly, I think their "Nam Nuong" is probably one of my favorites in town; charbroiled Vietnamese sausage strips, lettuces, fried noodles, and bean sprouts.  The texture of the cured salty meat and smokiness is accompanied by the crunchy texture of the fried noodles, bean sprouts and lettuce.  Along with this delectable dish is the sauce; which is orange in color with a peanut and what I can only describe as somewhat like a red pepper aioli and red chili mixture.  I could be wrong, but it's definitely the star of the night for me.    For my entree I went with a broken rice dish of course, which came with the Vietnamese meat sausage, shredded pork skin, eggrolls, pork chops, bean curd skin with shrimp, and shrimp paste.  Yes, indeed it was a loaded dish.  I would say my favorites were the eggrolls and the pork chops.  Eggrolls here are tad bit different from what I'm used to.  The ingredients within is familiar, but the shell itself is what I describe as a crustacean like look with an extra crunchy stickiness to it since it has the tendency to stick to your teeth slightly as you bite into it.    Overall, Com Tam Thuan Kieu has been around since the start of Mekong Plaza so they're definitely doing something right.  Service can be a hit or miss here, but nothing you can complain about. - Enjoy!

The Dark Horse rises!  Send out the signal Mr. Commissioner.  We shall convene at the bar!  Needed a dive to hangout with some friends.  I decided to check this place out on a whim and let's just say I did not regret it.  Good food and affordable drinks (AA Member here! Affordable Alcohol) I ordered the Rooster Burger, which came with some sport peppers on the side.  I love it when my burgers have some kick to it.   Grilled onions and Ortega chili a top a cheesy beef patty = yum!  My mate and I ordered their bucket of beer, which only came out to $10 for 5 bottles - Shazam!  I ain't talking about Shaq either!  Live music on a Saturday night.  It was a cover band that was rocking it!  Sweetness, they dressed up like the early 90's --- big hair and waves haha yep!    The place itself appears to be a sports bar.  Large LCD screens and a projector screen for the main game.  There was a poker game going on at the back of the bar and owners are definitely from SD - Booo!  Go Chiefs! - Enjoy

(Lyrics - Far East Movement - Like A G6)  Popping bottles P-H-X, in the desert When we drink we go Bo Bites gettin slizzard Sippin sizzurp in the Side, on 7th Ave.  Now I'm feeling so fly like the SideBar Like the SideBar, Like the SideBar Now I'm feeling so fly like the SideBar Like the SideBar, Likethe SideBar Now I'm feeling so fly like the SideBar  SideBar is an awesome hidden lounge right up stairs from the Pei Wei.  Might as well stop by for some eats before you make your way up.  There's something about a bar up the stairs that make it worth while.  I guess it's that allure of what's hidden?  Then again the way down might suck.    Needless to say, SideBar is a very chill place for a nice drink with a date or friends.  Live DJ during the weekends and local artist paintings decorated throughout the bar.  Nice comfortable couches on one side while high top tables and the full bar on the other.  Cool drink menu and a diverse crowd from all ranges of life and ages. - Enjoy!

Yes, indeed what can go wrong will go wrong, but sorry it doesn't apply here at Murphy's Law.  Free UFC fights what!? Yep, I don't understand why more bars won't do this, but total props for the Law.  Place was totally made for hanging out wearing shorts and t-shirt and maybe less :)  Price of the drinks were decent -- get the beer flights totally worth it if you don't know what to order.  I got me some steak fries, oh so worth it even though it's still a load of carbs to run off!  Service was good especially when the place was popping.  Chicks in short skirts and leggings, I'm not one to complain!  The place is decored with dollar bills which you can write yourself and post up!  I still gotta do that myself, but there's always next time.  To top it off live music on Saturday nights for sure, but not sure about the rest of the nights. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - The Clash - Rock the Casbah)  Now Bo Bites told the pizza man You have to let that sauce pop! The NY pizza comes desert's way Has been shaking to the top The bros they drove they're Cadillac They went a cruisnin down Gilbert The Yelpers was a chilling On the website they review  The people really like it CasaNova! CasaNova!  The people really like it Casanova! Casanova!  You gotta love Tony!    Tony is one of the owners of this mom/pop pizza joint.  His enthusiasm and customer relations is by far one of the best in town!  He makes you feel at home and enjoys chatting it up making sure your experience at Casanova Bros. Pizza special.    We started out dining experience off with some Mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini; while Tony offered us some free garlic knots for first timers!  First thing I notice was the marinara was pretty solid; nice subtle tomatoey sweetness.  It also came along with our mozzarella sticks, which was breaded with a light coat of breadcrumbs and oozing with soft mozzarella cheese.  Our fried zucchinis were perfect to the crunch and came with a ranch sauce.  For our pizza I went for the NY Special, which came with ham, pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs.  Overall a darn good pizza!  The crust had a solid crunch base while the dough was kept soft to the bite.    In the end, Casanova Bros. Pizza is my new favorite pizza spot on the East side of town.  The place was bustling with patrons and for good reason.  The pizza here is phenomenal! - Enjoy!

Starbucks with a dash of alcholic beverage - sweeeet!  Just when you thought it couldn't be improved well you're wrong!  Press is a cute little cafe located in City North, unfortunately :(  However, this place brings the smiles back.  Trendy and hip for sure.  Food here is wonderful - light sandwiches and salads with ingredients that bring a bang to your mouth --- mmmm.  Didn't try their wine, but no one can stop me now - next time I'm back let's do a toast!  Enjoy!

Um...yeah. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.  Not so great steak nor potato.  What kind of company is this?  A restaurant?  Are you sure?  Okay I'm being mean now :(  I sure this is a great franchise however it just didn't work for me.  I can't say I'm an expert in Philly sandwiches, but then again I really didn't order one.  I got a Philly burger, but man -- I rather eat at McDonald's - or even worse Hardees (You Midwest peeps know what I'm talking about :) )  Let's just say I'm not a chef but I can make a better tasting burger.  The decor of the place -- well I just didn't care for it after a while.  - Enjoy!

I can dig!  Avalon is hidden restaurant among S. Scottsale.  Americanize food by day and trendy hot lounge by night.  Music was nice and loud and danceable, but just hanging with good company will do.  The patio is open but since it's still pretty warm out; they kept the garage doors down ;(  However, the place is amazingly designed (Thanks Gary)  An artwork of a building and I can't wait till it's cooler so you can see the full spectrum!  Drinks are definitely decently priced!  Haven't had the chance to eat here yet, but not to worry; more to come so stay tuned.... enjoy!

(Lyrics - Adele - Set Fire to the Rain)  I'll eat it in, a bag And as it cooks, I'll add the spice to it It was dark as I stir it over Until you added to your menu and you saved me  My palate, it's strong But my appetite were far too weak To stay away from your ads Without falling to my feet  But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew All the time I thought it was only in a bag was never true, never true And at the prices you had, I would always buy; always buy ($.25 a bag!)  But I had Ramen at the Posh! Savour the taste as I stuffed my face! Let it burn while I cry Cause I could taste it screaming with flavors, with flavors!  Posh is an Improvisational kitchen, which means like improv comedy they create as they go.  Well somewhat I guess...they utilize seasonal ingredients to create a daily menu.  You pick and choose what meals you want from a list, which often times range from 3-7 courses.  If you ever been to Restaurant Week then it's a similar concept.    The night I went was Ramen noodles night or late night Japanese eats!  I don't really know if they really eat this late in Japan, but I guess that's what we're doing!    There were 3 different noodle dishes and 2 Japanese beers.  The noodles were Sesame, Soy, and Miso, while beer selection was Orion and Coedo.  I wasn't totally thrilled about either of the beer.  Along with the noodles we ordered the okonomiyaki, a pancake like dish with came with sprouts and bacon.  I thought it was good and savory, but the mayo and bacon was quite overpowering.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but less bacon please....  I ordered the Soy broth with my Ramen while my friends seem to all order the Sesame.  I didn't get a chance to taste anybody else's dish, but mine was pretty good.  It came with braised pork, scallions, and I believe radishes.  Nice and warm and yes I know on a warm summer PHX night, but it worked.  Ramen is so adaptable to so many ingredients.  To me, it's all about the broth.  If you can create a good broth then you can put tree bark and chocolate in the Ramen and I'll still eat it!  According to the waiter, which I might add didn't really do a good job, said they intend to have Ramen night every Wednesday starting at 9pm.  So gear up you Ramen fans cause now you have a place to go every Wednesday night! - Enjoy!

Welcome to the Pita Jungle we got hummus and drinks - We got everything on the menu that you want, pita we know the names We are the restaurants that you find, whatever you may eat If you got the money, honey we are here to please (your palates!)  I likes me some Sirloin and Hummus please!  Love to come here for lunch.  It's a tad bit on the heavy side, but I didn't tell anyone to eat the entire meal!  I always eat about 50% of the hummus.  Stuffing my face any more and I would be a glutton and I'm anything but.  Their wraps are excellent, but again take it easy cowboy.  If you can't or don't want to finish it all take home for a 2nd meal.  I recommend the Sirloin and Hummus for lunch for sure, but their variety of Pita sandwiches are just as good.  They salads are huge, but definitely worth it and on the healthier side too.  The service here is always tops, and hots, wink wink! :)  Overall, I like the ambience of this particular Pita Jungle.  Very modern and sleek with an industrial look.  I totally recommend a stop by if you're ever on the North side of town! - Enjoy!

Sigh.... I despise giving restaurants only 1 star.  Ai-yah!  Is what my mother would say.  I feel like it's starting to become a cliché for Chinese cuisine.  Name of restaurants must have the following words -- Super, Best, Jumbo, Grand, etc...you get the point (watch South Park episode 128 - "City Buffet").  Food was okay but nothing I couldn't have bought in a package and just added water.  I guess most Gwy-lo's wouldn't know the difference since it was a packed house.  Our service I must admit was excellent -- drinks filled and plates removed (Shi Shi!)  Ambience was nothing to talk about -- matter of fact I don't want to talk about it at all - Enjoy!

Wow is this place pretty or what!?  Gotta date you want to impress -- wink wink.  This place supplies the ambience and sets the tone for the mood you should be in; relaxed and chill.  I only had drinks here with my group (NAAAP), but I totally dig this place.  Nice jazzy and low lighting with a fire place.  A fire place in the desert!? Yes, my friend we get cold too.  Staff was bountiful and if you need; it they've already brought it for you - Bam!  My next visit is for dining - first I'll need a date :)  -  enjoy!

Alrighty besides the casino, the Red Rock Buffet is exactly what they say it is...it rocks!  I had a lot to eat mainly the crab legs.  Apparently there's a method to eating it, but I'm still the "grasshopper" at breaking it apart.  At first I was pretty skeptical about it simply because we're in the desert!  Crab legs! really!?  Yes, my friends it's not bad for the price and for the amount you're getting.  If you enjoy it as much as some of my friends and parents do...I recommend this place - enjoy!

Monday & Tuesday for $20 a bottle of wine & a board of bruschetta!  What more can I say -- but don't you cry for me Ari...zo...na!!!  I'll take advantage of this special as much as I can :)  Yeah I love this place.  It's definitely a lot better than the one in Arcadia.  It's more open plus there's generally more parking space.  The service here is real good and always entertaining.  Ambience is smooth and low key.  I dig....however is there live music here or am I attending during the wrong nights? hmmm - enjoy!

If you didn't tell me this place was not RA sushi I probably wouldn't know the difference.  Moira Sushi is located in Central PHX and not a lot of my friends know about this place.  I thought I stop by to check it out.  The ambience is pretty hip and cool, but besides that the food is okay.  What I do appreciate is they have beer from different Asian countries which is a plus.  Service was good nothing to complain about but nothing to be amazed either.  If you feel thirsty and need to just chill - stop by  for a while.  Enjoy!

Sorry gang...still can't recommend this place.  My reputation is on the line and I gotta be honest,  if I ever tell you go to this place; please forgive me.  I enjoy the atmosphere, but service is still lacking.  I've been a server and the last thing I want my customers to do is to chase me down.  If I start feeling like I've been a burden to you then my visit is just not worth it.    I do enjoy the food -- the Udon noodle is good, but there wasn't any of the Japanese beer left for me to order.  Apparently, they ran out - but don't tell me you can't order more.  In today's market and economy I'm sure if you want it, you can get it.  Orion & Asahi is good, but I can get those anywhere.  -- Enjoy (I think)

Mmmm Organic food ... wait what!?  Yeah I can't say I know the difference in taste.  I guess my palate is not as popping as I say it is -- or maybe there's real no difference!  I can appreciate the idea.  However, the organic part just sounds better and sophisticated.  I eat organic only a-har a-har a-har.  Picazzo's Organic Kitchen is a great selling tool.  Though I can't bash their pizza, it's actually pretty good.  I love their crust is that "organic"?  Gotta get their bacon bleu cheese wedge salad -- it's a must.  Organic Bacon?  Ambience makes you feel smarter too -- or maybe I'm that already :)  Service was great, my server recommended a small since it's actually a large :)  Do "organic" food appear more hmmm... - Enjoy!

Heyyyyyyyyy! It's all good! (in the hood) Ya'll ready for this  Uh huh....it's all good (in the hood) Heyyyyyyyyy! It's all good! (in the hood)  Call the game (at the tavern) See, I can order it plain (my fries) From going to the tavern we get paid (not really) Since I'm going eat Yum make my belly shake! (MC Hammer - It's All Good - lyrics)  Arcadia Tavern is located off Indian School and 48th St.  The tavern offers great American classic meals and appetizers!  Yes, great place to hang for Happy Hour and a game, which they offer all NFL games!  Music during the weekends and some weekday nights too!  I always order their Happy Hour appetizers here.  Cheeseburger sliders, artichoke dips, chicken fingers, and Nachos.  I have to say they're all great with beer!   Haha!  However, if you're too late for HH, the tavern's regular menu is just as good.  They have the Hangover burger here that is fast becoming popular.  Gee I wonder why!?   Juicy burger topped with jack cheese, bacon, onions, tomatoes, and finally a fried egg!  Yeah, if you have heart conditions then stay away!    During the wee evening hours they fire up a street taco grill.  Yes, this brings me back to the good ol' party days!  I'm half drunk and trying to eat spicy ass street tacos!  My advice, bring a DD or be one -- DD means designated drinker right!?  Just kidding play safe my friends.  -  Enjoy!

Tell me when will you be mine - tell me quando quando quando - the pizza "Parlor" is divine - tell me quando quando quando :)  Love the atmosphere and feel here; chill and smooth.  The pizza here is divine; nectar of the gods :)  Perfect to share with good company and perfect for a night of forgetting the worst and bringing out the laughter.  The design and decor is very modern and earthy.  Totally dig the barber's chairs at the pizza bar.  Service was real good and never lacking in any way.  Drinks were full and plates were cleaned --- Indeed they were :) - Enjoy!

My big fat Greek Patio -- an ass after eating here.  I don't think the owners really know how to run a restaurant.  It almost feels like eating out of a food truck here.  I ordered the Chicken Pita with a side of fries.  I think it's pretty good Greek style pita with the cucumber dill yogurt sauce.  The Chicken was grilled nicely and had that smoking smell.  Overall, the food was decent and it is what it is.  I just feel a tad bit heavier after a meal here.   Regarding the service, it's a food truck inside a building.  Don't expect much here since smile is too much to ask for and sometimes it doesn't seem they want to be there.  It's slow to get your food, but at least you know it's made to order.    The decors are very tacky and the god awful music plays.....please make it stop!  They have a pair of television sets on Sportcenter.  I guess that helps drown out the hectic scene. - Enjoy!

I was born to eat Pho!  My Vietnamese half is always exploring new Pho restaurants while my Chinese side makes me a diligent worker bee toiling away in some sweat shop :P j/k....I like Blue Moon's Pho, about a year ago when I came I couldn't say much of it, but since it's Pho Challenge I'm back.  Yes, my friends a PHO challenge -- I don't know how much Pho exactly but man when you see the bowl you'd slouch in a fetal position with thumb in mouth.  I'm not man enough to do this challenge - I gotta keep my girlish figure haha ;P  Aside from the challenge the Pho has definitely improved.  Decor is modest and modern.  Service was very good and on the ball.  Price --- wow about $3.50 for a bowl of Pho - Yah!  Cheap eats = Full Belly!  - Enjoy!

I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries!  Any place serving this yummy delicious ingredient deserves my love.  I think I can survive off this for 30 days....any reality TV show takers...huh..huh?  Well, over food was really excellent.  Gourmet burgers are to die for aren't they!?  Sorry Carl's Jr...your $6 burger -- really?  I had the number 3 here - yeah sounds like a secret Chinese sauce, but better!  My burger was cooked just right - juicy and medium-well.  The service was good and the atmosphere tries to re-enact modern hip fine dining.  Though you probably wouldn't know the difference after a few bottles here :) - enjoy!

I'm not saying this place is bad, but it doesn't really differentiate itself from any other yogurt shop.  You pour yogurt in your tub and add toppings; they weigh it and you pay for it...pretty simple concept.  I rather enjoyed my smoothie.  Service is pretty good.  I think they have a great location - right outside the theaters.  There's not a lot of chairs indoor and the outdoor has a small patio.  If you're a yogurt freak I gather you should stop by and take a gander.  Otherwise any yogurt shop would do.  Enjoy!

Am I getting too old for this?  Me thinks not!  Granted I'm not the youngest cat in the crowd, but I think I deserve some love don't I?  Well I guess not at McFadden's. I might not be that young lad that buys drinks for everyone and continue to pound down shots of liquor in the attempt to get myself drunk anymore.  However, I'm the guy that can actually afford it without burning a hole in my wallet - wink!  Maybe you should be looking my way next time instead of continue to serve the drunk dude down the bar who probably shouldn't be drinking anymore unless tent city is the next destination for him.    Loud obnoxious drunks and college frat party like atmosphere only goes so far.  Let's just keep it where it belongs because I really don't know if it should be public thing unless it's a place called Vegas.  Westgate is no Vegas!    I can party with the best, but even I felt uncomfortable here.  Let's just say if a fight broke out I wouldn't be surprised.  Patio is nice, but without a smoke vent is sucks -- yes I know the "patio" needs a smoke vent!  Unfortunately a bad experience this time; we'll see if I ever return to do a follow-up. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Spice Girls - I Wannabe)  LoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want LoLo tell me what you want, what you really really want LoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want LoLo tell me what you want, what you really really want I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna really Really, really want some Chicken & Waffles  If you want some cool-aid, get some on tap If you wanna get some breakfast, better make it last Now don't go wasting these pieces of chicken Get your appetite together, and we will be just fine.  LoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want LoLo tell me what you want, what you really really want LoLo!, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want LoLo tell me what you want, what you really really want I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna really Really, really want some Chicken & Waffles  Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles has been around the Phoenix are for quite some times and has been a local favorite for many reasons.  Chicken and waffles? Yes, indeed it is a deadly combination!  If you ever need to carbo load I tell ya this is your place.    I generally can't eat a lot so I opt out on the sha-bang of 3 pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, grits, 2 eggs, and cheese.  Yeah tell me about it!  That's a lot of food!  Yummy though!  I go for the Shee-dah's Special; 1 breast, wing, and waffle.  Overall, I love it!  Nice succulent chicken and syrup induced waffles!  By god, what have you done to us!  I can't complain about obesity problems in America especially when you come to Lo-Lo's; instead embrace it haha!  I did indeed tried the Kool-Aid on tap.  Personally, I don't think I can handle so much sugar in a beverage!  Once you take a swig; you're thirsty for water!  In the end, Lo-Lo's deliver what they say; Chicken & Waffles.  Service is real attentive and overall the food is a must try if you never had chicken & waffles! - Enjoy!

Wow!  This place is pretty awesome.  Food is A++ I must say.  I'm not a big fan of Americana food, but this place definitely impressed me.  I just had their BBQ Burger and it was popping.  I love the layout of the place; high ceilings and very open.  Their patio is pretty narrow but still awesome.  However only one small fire pit...then again we live in PHX.  Service was good...nothing to rave about, but our waiter was cool.  I was there during happy hour/dinner and it wasn't too busy so if you just want a good drink or two with a friend ... you know where to go ;)

(Lyrics - Mr Big - To Be With You)  Hula's Modern Tiki Show me what you got to eat Drinks up, Luau Pork A Longboard Lager can't be that bad When it's brewed, it's brewed Hula's will make you breakfast too So come on, foodies, come on over Let Bo Bites be the one to show you  I'm the one who wants to eat with you  Deep inside I hope you'll taste it too  Waiting in a line for drinks and food Just to be the next to eat with you  Hula's Modern Tiki is fast becoming one of Phoenix's downtown staple.  Always open and always on the trend of making this happen.  Seasonal and daily specials so this is definitely one of those places that is worth the visit.  Hula's, like the name says, is a modern tiki restaurant.  The displays and decor are not as tacky though.  Actually well maintained and a lovely spot to to hang with friends or bring a drink date.  I love coming here for brunch!  $2 mimosas and the menu is a knockout!    We started with some spicy edamame and crispy shrimp eggrolls.  The spicy edamame made me want to drink more haha cause it was SPICY!  Loved it! While the eggrolls were crispy and crunchy from the shell. the shrimp texture mellowed it out.  I ordered the Luau Pork for my main; thought it was okay, I didn't care for the porky taste I guess, but my friend ordered their jerk fish.  Hands down I was so jealous cause it was damn good! The jerk was nice and creamy and with a kicking spice as it should be.    Overall, service was very good and food was excellent as usual.  You can't ask for anything more from a restaurant.  Thanks Hula!  - Enjoy!

Ahhh!  Finally a Korean restaurant by me!  Traveling up and down searching for good Korean food can be hard and tiresome.  This one's right down the street from me.  At first I thought it was just called Korean Restaurant (that's some originality!), but didn't see the little sign "RED KIMCHI" on the side.  I'm not a big fan of Korean BBQ since I like the way I smell :) haha!  What I'm a big fan of is the Tofu Seafood soup - Mmm so warm and toasty in my tummy!  Red Kimchi is what I expect from a Korean restaurant -- good tofu soup, Hite beer, great service, and good Asian decors and design -- very clean bathroom by the way haha! - Enjoy!

You know, it's not just about the food and the drinks sometimes.  It's the service that can bring you back or not.  With that being said...what service!?  Gosh, maybe my Engrish not goo and you didn't hear me co-wreck-lee, but when I request for my check maybe someone should attend to me to get it rolling!  Didn't think trying to pay was such a huge ordeal!  We even had someone go and chase down our "waitress" to ask for some help, but the Devil had other plans and she played a disappearing act.  However, before the Devil gets to me --- drinks at this place wasn't too bad - Enjoy!

Need a quick meal for lunch?  Well Miracle Mile has your sandwich ready and on time.  I was really fascinated by how fast I got my sandwich.  They definitely had it down like a production line.   My sandwich was okay...it's nothing to rave about.  I think you could go to any small deli sandwich shop and get the same taste.  However, like I said if you're on a rush eh...go for it!

I've come to this place several times and it never once has disappointed me.  Yum!  Need a heart attack anytime soon anybody?  Yeah, bagel pastrami sandwiches can provide that quick if you keep eating one, but boy is it good.  I might just take one for the team and suffer a heart shutdown :)  However, this place charges a pretty penny for something that basic - granted I'm not saying I can re-create any of their sandwiches, but wow we're in a recession man!  This place is definitely proud of their NY background and it shows on the walls; plus their accent is undeniable - ya heear!  -- yeah not sure if that's from NY either haha!  Regardless, I would recommend this joint if any of you are close by and stop for some heart-stopping food :) - enjoy!

Cough! Cough! Excuse me I just walked out of the casino!  I forgot how it felt to be suffocated indoors with a bunch of smokers.  Sorry smokers no pun intended :)  This casino is a huge circle period....with a crappy bar in the middle.  Food court was decent because they have some popular brand name restaurants.  I went to the club when they first opened....yah! Are those booths to sit or for me to fall asleep?  Let's just say it wasn't much to experience - thank god I got in free!  If your hands are itchy and need to throw some money at the casino quick...this place does alright, but if you need to be entertained...go to Casino AZ

I really don't know what the rave about this place is!?  Came here on a Monday afternoon for lunch and ordered the single burger with some fries.  The gal at the counter was super nice and cool.    However, I can't say the same for the burger.  Pretty simple one patty burger with tomatoes, onions, and pickles....um...yeah that's about it.  My patty was not super dry, but darn close.  The bun was you basic hamburger bun.  So really why does it cost what it cost for such a simple burger.  Because it's made with a "modern" grill?  I could get the same at Mc'ds and be more content and plus at least I'll get a toy with it in a pretty box.  Mines with in a brown bag with Modern Burger stamp....yahhhh....... :(  Overall, I'm baffle why people would compare this burger as one of the best in town.  Shame on you fools!  I wasn't even in a bad mood when I came  -- was totally in an awesome mood so nope -- last time I checked I don't have those time of the months.  Maybe someday I'll feel to give this a try, but for now; sorry folks can't recommend - Enjoy!

I'm hangin' around downtown Chandler more for some reason and this place always brings me back.  I dig it!  Food is pretty good and so are their sushi.  They have an entertaining menu and their drinks specials during happy hour is awesome.  I LOVE their decor...!  Asian art and old city loft feel.  They have a nice patio out back with an open bar and fire pit.  Every now and then they have a live band or DJ.  Karaoke much?  Well this place has their own private room which you can reserve and it's not over priced like most places I've been to around the valley.  Staff here are always friendly and nice.  This place gets my thumbs way up! :)

(Lyrics - Toni Basil - Hey Mickey)  Oh, Tottie, you're so good You're so good you fill my belly Hey, Tottie Hey, Tottie  Oh, Tottie, you're so good You're so good you fill my belly Hey, Tottie Hey, Tottie  Oh, Tottie, you're so good You're so good you fill my belly Hey, Tottie Hey, Tottie  Hey, Tottie I've been eating all night And that's never too long I think you've got fried rice and I think I'll order some pad thai I can handle some Thai spice and I would like to take some home, Tottie  Hey Tottie your food is so good so good hey Tottie!  One of the best Asian fusion cuisines in town by far.  Tottie has been featured in local magazines as one of the top chefs around that valley.  That really says something and needless to say Tottie's Asian Fusion doesn't disappoint.  I suggest family style since the dishes here are large.  I'm a big fan of the Tom Yum soup, Pad See Ew, and Chiang Mai Noodles.  The level of spice is up to you.  I can hang with the best however, I'll have to pass on the Thai spice haha!  I like to be able to taste my food aside from the spiciness.  Overall, the food is excellent, but also the decors are amazing.  Local artist Gary Hostellero doesn't hold back as he displays some of his finest works around the restaurant.  Live music during the weekends and a great atmosphere makes Tottie's a place for great dining and great chill out spot. - Enjoy!

I got my first Happy Hour glass of wine Bought it at the 5th and Wine Drank it till my face turned red Was the summer in the 2000s  Me and some guys from work Had a craving so we ordered some food Glass of wine, plate of bruschetta Shoulda known, we've finished it all  Oh when I look back now That summer seemed to last forever And if I had the choice Yeah, I'd always want to be there Those were the best of 5th and Wine (Bryan Adams - Summer of 69)  5th and Wine is located right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  Off 5th Ave and Goldwater.  It's snugged inside the art area.  I've always enjoy coming here during HH!  $5 for a glass of wine!  They have a huge list to choose from so you won't be missing out on any of your favorites.    My gang and I ordered a plate of bruschetta and we were good!  Hummus, Steak, Prosciutto, and Apple/Brie on a nice plate and atop a crunchy bread -- Yum!  Totally enjoyed this combo with my wine -- My favorite is Pinot Noir.  Though I did try their burgers; I would try to stick with food that goes well with your wine.  I think the burgers are pretty original with different ingreidients like bison with corn, but man it didn't do much for me.    The place itself is pretty casual and classy with some interesting artwork.  There's a small living room-like area where you could chill while people watch.  However, this is also the area where the band generally plays.  Live music every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights! - Enjoy!

Pad See Ew!  It's what I always order or the Dragon Noodles if they serve it.  Wow me with the Pad See Ew and it's all good.  How's this place do, well I was wow'd and in sweatin' -- fire breathe!  I generally gage a Thai place by how well their fried noodles taste.  Kudos -- however, I can't say the same for the appetizers.  Fried Tofu need more crunch!  Our service was excellent and don't "Phuket" the beer :)  Great HH prices on the drinks. I like the ambience, but I wish Thai restaurants would get more creative with their design.  I know it's a Thai restaurant when I see one. - Enjoy!

Definitely one of the toughest hikes right outside of PHX.  I would rate this one side by side with Camelback and I'll explain later.  If you can do Camelback try x2!    This is one of those great weekend hikes with friends.  I would say it would take 5 hours total.  If you aren't sure you can do this; don't do this!  However, if you're a trail runner this should take at least 3 hours tops.  Again, if you think you can do this; try to be positive and know you can!  Okay I say it's equal to Camelback because I do trail running and going up and down Echo Canyon and Cholla Trail and back again is so much tougher!  However, I would still recommend Flatiron just for the experience! - Enjoy!

I can dig!  Food here is very good.  I believe everything here is made from scratch the soup to the sauce cause they taste wonderful.  I go for lunch every now and then and I've seen this place slowly pickup business.  It has that deli-sport restaurant feel, but the food brings it home.  I appreciate the usage of real plates instead of paper or styrofoam plates -- very environmental friendly!  I would definitely recommend this place for lunch - 1/2 sand, their pastafagioli soup = Yum! & drink.

Yum! One of my new favorite restaurants!   Main Ingredient is a literally a house you walk into for a delicious meals. Is it really home cooked?  Close enough my friends.  I came here for lunch and ordered the BLT sandwich. I'm not much of a BLT sandwich guy but the thought of pork belly bacon raised my interest.  Needless to say I was totally satisfied. Mmmmmm...The bacon wasn't too crispy and it didn't fall apart like most bacon would when you take a first bite. The avocado was a perfect match. My mouth is watering talking about this BLT sandwich haha!  My friend order the Winner salad -- you can't go wrong with a name like that.  Turkey, salami and hardboiled eggs.  Seems pretty basis but definitely worth a try!  Service was real good and my water was quick to fill.  The place itself was full of different artworks.  The front yard is the patio, but not enough sunlight hits it so I decided to sit indoors. However, I'm sure I'll come back someday to sit outdoors.  HH all day Sunday! - Enjoy!

I'll eat here for lunch if I need sustenance.  I'm generally not a big fan of deli shops, but when you need food - you need food!  There's really nothing fancy about their sandwiches - either that or I ordered the wrong meal (CK Parm Sandwich).  Does Boar's Head own this joint...talk about loyalty to the brand.  Granted Boar's Head does make some yummy deli meats, but man where's your own identity!?  Aside from the picture frames of old New York and some sports memorabilia; there's nothing New York about this place.  The price like all deli joints around - I feel is over priced.  Again, I come for lunch not for fine dining.  Service, well they were pretty quick I might add, but I hope it doesn't take much time to make a sandwich anyways.... - Enjoy!

Yogurt + Boba = :)  For some time now I had to go to 2 different places: one for yogurt and one for Boba.  Oh such a hassle!  Wait what's this?  Yogurt and Boba in one place com'on don't tease me!   Finally, someone put 2 of my favorite, but not frequent :) desserts in one. What took so long! This nice little mom/pop shop is located on the North side of Mekong Plaza.  Perfect location for patrons about to leave the food court to grab a quick dessert.  I ordered the Wild Berry Smoothie with some Boba.  I love it when the ice makes the Boba a tad bit harder.  So much fun and so much yum!    The place itself is very modern and sleek like any other yogurt shop where you have to serve your own yogurt.  Nice high top tables and with some Easter color designs.  Reminds me of the old days when Boba shops first appeared in the scene. - Enjoy!

I'm not a big fan of buffets in general.  Every now and then I'll find a decent one.  This place got couple things right - it's in the East, it's a Super Buffet, but I think they exaggerated on the #1 part.  Needless to say I wasn't too impress.  Food was for sustenance, aside from that I think it definitely needs improvement.  I enjoy their concept of integrated the sushi bar in a buffet setting.  Why do all Asians go to Chinese Buffets? Crab Legs, my friends - yes Deadliest Catch is probably every Asian persons favorite show.  However the crab legs here were too soggy and salty - needs to be steamed and cleaned out better.  Though I did enjoy their fresh oysters, but then I can only stomach about 3 total.

The Grind: sounds like a latex induced club rockin Orgy's - Blue Monday!  How do you feel to treat me like you do?  This was a Yelp find for me so expectations were high.  At first I thought the place seemed pretty cool - it was dark and dink with a huge bar and flat screens lined up across to catch all the games.  I ordered the sweet and spicy burger while my partner ordered the turkey burger. I'm going to be honest the wait was long, but I guess they were short handed.  Our waiter offered me a free drink afterwards.  Let's say service was real good overall.  The burger was....huh...plain.  I thought the sweet and sour part didn't really go well.  The burger was huge since the patty itself was a mouth full.  However, mines was dry and crumbly.  I ordered the half and half - herbed fries and sweet potatoes -- it was again okay at best.  "When you lay your burgers upon me and tell me who you are? Those who came before me, I lived through their yelp, from the past reviews, I will turn away.....well turn away. - Enjoy!

I eat a lot of Thai food; this place is definitely one of my favorites.  Why? Cause it's right down the street from me and the closest Thai restaurant around.  However, it's not to say it's not good; it's excellent.  I like the small and local own restaurants that have great food.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, matter fact it looks like some dive Thai food place, but inside they have a pretty nice setup.  I always gage Thai food by their Drunken Noodles - don't know why, but love it!  Recommendation and thumbs up for this place :)

Not bad since I was tad bit worried when I saw the patty.  A little thin I thought to myself.    However, my first bite into it was delightful!  I ordered the Arizona - Habanero Cheese, Guacamole, Chipotle Mayo, on a Chipotle bun.  Though it was a tad bit spicy I scarfed my burger down in less than 5 minutes.  Maybe I should have ordered the larger size.  I love my burgers with Jalapenos and an extra kick and the Arizona delivered.  I was disappointed by the fries though; very plain and my sweet potato fries were soggy -- Blah!  The ambience has that modern diner feel and look.  Stainless steel and high vaulted ceilings make this place cold and loud.  I didn't mind, but I sat outside regardless.  On a perfect night I recommend that - good food and good weather -- sign! - Enjoy!

You are what you eat and this cow ate well. :) (I was referring to the actual moo-cow that is - haha!)  Burgers & wine, some beer and some fries; have a toast with milkshakes and some zucchini breaded and fried - yum!  Zucchini in the fryer?  Why not it tastes just as good as some yam fries.  The ambience was chill, but I can do without the pictures on the walls.  I don't want my farmer to wear any sort of bio-suit - I want him or her in overalls or if she's, hot dazy dukes :)  Service was good, I always enjoy my server able to take a joke or two and come back with some :)  - Enjoy!

Uptown Vig It's been serving up some uptown food I bet it's never served a Scottsdale guy  I bet the chef really never thought why?  I'm gonna try The Uptown Vig It's been hiding in the Phoenix valley As long as they serve up a cup of joe And now it's looking for a Scottsdale man  That's what I am! (Lyrics - Billy Joel - Uptown Girl)  The Uptown Vig has been in the valley for over 5 years serving up some delitable dishes; great for the hangover!  Not the movie, but seriously, get you butt up and hit up The Uptown Vig.  You might find yourself and uptown girl like Billy.  The Vig as we call it, ah har har, is a modern hip place where live music and game playing are mixed together.  It's patio area is a great place to catch some sun glare while sipping your mimosa and or wine; hell hit me up with another shot!    The Uptown Vig as I've stated, serves up a mean hangover brunch menu.  They literally have a dish called the Hangover Helper.  Does it work?  I'll let you be the judge, but I tell you what as a runner it's great way to carbo load!  I recently had the Monte Cristo, which I'm not too sure why it's called that, but wowza!  French Toast sandwich with ham and over easy egg! Whaa!?  Sha-yeah!  If I had a hangover I've forget about it already.  Top it off with some fresh strawberry preserves and whip cream and you're golden boy (Outsider reference!).  Enjoy!

5 Guys is an odd name, but whatever works for you.  This burger joint claims to be one of the best around the nation.  Just look at all the signs they post and how proud they are; granted I appreciate confidence.  Burgers here are mediocre - nothing to rave about and crave for during those sleepless nights.  Fries are my favorite since they're real chopped potatoes.  Atmosphere...what I can't hear you?  Yeah, I generally don't enjoy places where I have to debate whether to dance or eat :(

Hotel Theodore aka Mondrian aka JBar -- Whatever!  Different spelling same shizzz.  They didn't change the interior much from the last owners.  Let's just say I wasn't too impress.  It was a sure quiet night for a Friday night.  I'm sure the hotel patrons slept well.  I surely did!  Another thing, if I wanted to salsa dance I think I will go to Pepins, not the Theodore.  Granted they were playing for the crowd, but that ruined it for me.  Aside from poor music choice, it's Scottsdale; what's a nightclub/bar without a douche or two.  Oh they were there, but tad bit harder to find these days - are Affliction T-shirts out!!??

Never thought much about Ramen noodles and how you can really make a meal of it.  Generally, it's one of those college foods you eat when you're dead broke and starving.  I can appreciate taking a simple dish and making it the main feature of the restaurant.  The noodles here is good and spicy I must say - if you need more spice; grab yourself a bottle of Siracha.  I can't handle my spice like I used to and it was just right for me.  Decor was simple Ikea like furniture - nothing wrong as long as it works.  Service was good with a friendly smile.  If I ever need another Ramen fix and feel lazy to make my own - I know where to go now.  There's a little boba shop connected to Republic so don't forget to grab some with your meal.  Enjoy!

Sleek, nice, and smooth -- no I'm not talking about the coffee.  It's the place.  Not your typical Starbucks my friends.  Echo is a quaint local coffee shop that has some good pastries and a nice place to lounge and hangout.  I enjoy their couch area -- very homey.  Anyways, I always enjoy my coffee in a coffee mug - not your "Starbucks" cup.  Yeah I'm getting sick of those - granted they keep my coffee warm; it's just not the same as a mug :)  I had some oatmeal cookies here - yum!  Indeed goodbye six-pack; we had a good run :(  Haven't tested out their Wi-Fi yet, but I found a new location to study....if I ever have time to study hehe - enjoy!

De do do do de da da da Is all I can eat with you De do do do de da da da Just keep stuffing my face and I'll pull through De do do do de da da da Is all I can say to you De do do do de da da da There's so many food and that is true! (Lyrics - Sting & Police - De do do do de da da da)  Wondering Horse Buffet is not your typical buffet around the valley.  They definitely have an edge on their competition.  Fresh seafood like king crab legs, shrimp cocktails, and oysters!  Yummy!  They also have hand cut prime rib and something strange, but very good -- pork belly slices!  So good and so wrong haha!  Along with my favorites, they have a plethora of cuisines from different regions.  Mexican, Asian, and Italian dishes spread across the buffet room, while a wood burning grill bakes up some fresh pizza.  My favorite in the buffet room is the dessert right dead center of the place.  The little cheesecakes, strawberry shortcakes, and brownies look so good you wouldn't want to eat it.  Nicely crafted into small figurine like statues; they're a work of art!  The place itself is very nice.  Great overview of what heard is to become a shopping center and pool area.  Wandering Horse Buffet is far back in the casino so might as well play your luck after a great dinner! - Cheers!

What The Duce!?  For starters, where the heck is this place? At first, I wasn't sure if I should be walking in simply because the factory workshop look threw me off!  Um ... hello?  No worries, once we walked into the store area that's when the fun started.  This place really got my interest.  Seems to me you can purchase some vintage items and clothes.  They had stadium-seating area with a projector screen, an ice cream shake area, boxing ring, and a small gym -- where the heck am I!     We finally found the restaurant area shortly.  The kitchen is an old school food truck, then again everything about this place is old school; chairs, tables, etc.  I ordered the sliders because it was a recommendation - meatball, chicken sausage, and bbq brisket.  A bottle of coke -- yep it figures.  Meatball sliders were the best of the 3, the sausage was definitely and acquired taste.   My sis, had the eggs and avocado one and it was okay.    I enjoy my visit to the Duce simply because of it's odd ball nature.  It's definitely an experience wortha visit.  -  Enjoy!

Bo Bites! First off, let me say a few things to give an image in your mind - White Trash with Class.  I dig Big Daddy's BBQ!  What can I say Pulled Pork on Wonder Bread & a glass of PBR hmm....  These's guys really know how to BBQ Midwest style.  They have a hugh smoker in the back kitchen and a large pot waist height just for their beans.  They really have it down as an assembly line to push out their meals in a quick and timely manner.  Food is great!  I like their Pulled Pork, Tri Tip, and Brisket.  Not too yippy bout the Beef Brisket, but not much I can say there.  My buddy had the Chicken and he loved it.    I hope this place stays open and become successful.  Only thing I see as a downer is the location - Shea & 101 - not much of a happening place.  They're kinda hard to see from Shea and since you can't have any signs in Scottsdale; it makes it that much tougher.

Wow!  I'm pretty impressed here.  First thing I notice about this place is that it looks like we're in China :)  Second, there is a  huge window in the back of the restaurant looking into the kitchen.  Yeah, this place makes their own noodles and the dude making it was pretty good and well skilled.  I always enjoy watching my food made from scratch; not to say it's scratch, but you get it....Prices are dirt cheap for what they're serving.  The food is good here and I can't say much more about it simply because I'm Chinese and it's Chinese food...eat it.  Service was good; poor waitress couldn't explain to me what Mae-Toh was, but thru some poor translation I declined to order it haha!  If it is what she said it is - I enjoy interesting food every now and then, but this time I gotta say no :)

My family and I ordered a big butt load of food.  They have this platter I'll refer as big butt load of food because that what it is.  They have everything on this platter for you to try.  I enjoy the ribs the most for obvious reasons - they fall right off the bone yum!  The chicken and tri-tip wasn't much to rave about - corn bread muffin style that's pretty cool.  Big butt load of food also came with some corn on a cob & some wedge potato fries (according to Man vs. Food eat the carbs last)  There wasn't much of a drink special - mostly for mix drinks - yeah what's up with that?  I want beer with my BBQ man!  Ambience is alright southern rock n roll with some down home feel.  Service was good and they were on top of it.  The BBQ sauce I gotta say they had enough on the food, but with 5 different flavors you can't help but play around with it (Try the Devil's Spit!)

Not a fan of slow service and decent food.  I think the Blue Coyote refers to my mood and my belly hollowing and being hungry.  They ran out of a product and they had to switch it up which is not a big deal.  They made it work and that's what I appreciate.  We ordered the Drums of Heaven which I heard was really good.  They didn't have the right Chicken but substituted with another.  I thought it was pretty good since the brown sauce is usually really salty, but this one wasn't.   My sister and I each ordered a burger.  Mines was well done, real.... well.  It was somewhat dry in the middle plus I didn't care too much for the condiments.  I actually had to add ketchup, which I generally don't when ordering a hamburgers.  I would say the fries were my favorite.  Steak potato fries are yummy, but my I'm sure my love handles are screaming at me!  The ambience was pretty strange.  It had that truck stop cafe feel with some modern pop.  The Sushi bar really made a difference to the feel, but it was really awkwardly placed.  I didn't think it really belonged and it should just branch out on it's own to attract more customers.  Blue Coyote Cafe doesn't really scream sushi to me.    The service like I said was slow, but I don't think I can blame our waitress.  She did a great job of making us feel welcomed and was really polite.  I think there was confusion on who was supposed to serve us in the beginning and with the missing ingredient; really slowed the serving of the food.  - Enjoy!

I have to admit I expected more from this place than I got.  Here's the deal, you want decent HH for a low price?  You got it!  You want good service too?  No problem.  You want good food -- whoa there cowboy!  If this place was small dive I would totally understand, but hey you just happen to be in the Scottsdale Quarter where everything must be a hit right? Right!?  Needless to say I appreciate our Aussie bartender he was cool!  The ambience is alright -- not my cup of tea -- got that cigar smoking lounge, sport bar flare and a stage for live band just in case.  Don't get me wrong I dig live bands.  Maybe just not in this setting.  Prices, like I said were good, but I guess you get for what you pay for - Enjoy!

Get off of my fork Get into my mouth Get off of that grill Get into some sauce (BBQ) Get into my belly yum yum, yeah  Get outta my mind Get into my life Oooooooooh Oh I said hey (Hey) you (You) Get into my belly (Lyrics - Billy Ocean - Get Into My Car)  Pork on a Fork was showcased on Drive-In, Dives, and Diners with Guy Fieri not too long ago.  From there they've became a hit and won numerous awards, plus rave reviews both on Yelp and from Foodies around the valley.  Needless to say, this place is pretty darn good wouldn't you say!    My office is close by so whenever I get a chance I try to hit the Fork.  Their Pulled Pork Sandwich is what I would consider the quintessential pulled pork meal. With sides of fingerling potatoes and coleslaw.  Good'o boys meal I guess, but man the pork and soft and tender; add some spicy bbq and finger licking good -- YUMMY!  Portions here are modest I think so you won't over eat in my opinion.    The place itself started in modest fashion.  When I first came there was maybe 6 tables max, but now they have an entire huge patio in the back.  Let's just after having a meal here you'll need more room - wink!  Again, this place is a dive so take the boys out and leave the dating scene out! - Enjoy!

This place is inside Harrah's Casino and signage to promo the place seemed so enticing; so what was one to do!  KGB - Not all burgers are created equal (which is weird to have a Communist theme, since isn't communism the theory or principle to achieve supreme equality and does not validate the sale of labor?)  Anyways, enough with the politics and history lesson! I ordered the double cheeseburger and some waffle fries with cheese and BBQ pork.  Overall, I think the highlight of our meal was the fries!  Nice and crunchy while the melted cheese oozed over the BBQ Pork gave it some texture. The BBQ pork and cheese was the yummy factor.  My burger, well I wasn't too impressed. Let's just call it an over glorified Red Robins - even then I still prefer Red Robins; less expensive and not pretentious.    Service was mixed.  My hostess did well and I think some of the water boys/host/not sure what their real job is; did real well.  My "server" nice hot looking gal, but damn does that mean you don't have to work!?  Maybe her modeling gig wasn't panning out, but I sure would like my burger, utensils, napkins, and bill promptly please.   If you need a quick bite and it's late after the clubs yeah come by KGB, but for good food and decent service -- ehhhh yeah not sure if this is the place. - Enjoy!

Wow, the number of flat screens in this bar would impress the football gods!  I felt really welcomed when I visited Blue 32 -- it wasn't too rowdy nor too quiet either.    I ordered the Black and Blue burger, which definitely hit the spot.  Though, I do need to get my butt back to the gym.  Regardless, bleu cheese and bacon on a burger -- how can you say No!?  It was cooked perfectly and with fat yummy fries on the side.  Didn't order a drink unfortunately this time since my weekend hangover was still lingering haha!    Service was okay; we were greeted with a smile.  Though I'm always irked when I have to wait for my water to be filled, but all is well.  The ambience was real chill for a sports bar, but like I said not too rowdy is good for me.  I like the spot lighting and the booth and bar separation was perfect. - Enjoy!

I love this place!  I would come here every night they have Flamenco dances if I could cause I love Flamenco!  The food here is pricy for tapas, but I'm not going to complain cause I thought overall it's pretty good. I didn't know what my friend ordered, but it was music to my palate while I savor the moment as I watched the Flamenco dancer sway, move, and stomp with a passion!  Must need strong thighs and calves I gather.  We ordered some finger potatoes with a creamy cilantro aioli, escargot in a red marinara, and some cherry tomatoes salad -- Yum Yum and Yum!  The service was pretty good overall, but both host looks like they were hit mans! No disrespect, but tone it down. Suits are great, but I would go with all black with black tie to give that 5 star service flare.  Ambience was great!  What can I say play some Flamenco music and yes you had me at hello! - Enjoy!

Wow when my friend said we got VIP to bowl I wasn't too impressed.  When I got here I was totally 180'd.  Hot waitresses, disco bowling, DJ spinning, loungin' on the couch and clubbers dancin' away.  There was free food & drinks all night woohoo!! (Granted VIP night before grand opening).  Still the place was popping.  The bowling system was off the chart and high tech - yeah it was for bowling.  Located in CityScape; this is definitely gonna be the next hot spot in downtown PHX.  Which is great since downtown is so lacking in the night life!  As for the food man it was good.  Not your typical slider I tell ya.  The ambience is just right - how they got that high-end bowling and bar lounge to work??  Beats me but  it does; I'm gonna have my birthday here! - Enjoy!

Of Wolfley and Man! (Metallica Reference!)  I came here for lunch with an associate and I wanted to try something new. Wolfley's was definitely something you can't find anywhere in the country so what the hey! I would have ordered their hometown favorite roast beef sandwich, but the waitress warned me it was quite salty.  I'm glad she did since I don't take kindly on overly salty foods. So I ordered the cheeseburger sliders instead. Let's just say I wasn't sure if should have sucked it up and tried the roast beef sandwich instead. Sliders were, well sub par and basic. It was pretty dry and it came along with some fried onion flakes. I needed to douse it with some ketchup to help me swallow it. My meal also came along with a side salad, which was probably the better of the two. However, I found a few brown leaves and tried to work around it.   Service was good overall and the place was pretty well put together. Definitely a cool place to hang with the boys for a game. I went on Wolfey's website and notice they are fond of charitable work and non-profits coming to their place - Kudos! Then again in my honest opinion I'm not sure I would want to recommend this place unless it's just for drinks. - Enjoy!

Taco Tuesdays! Yeah!!!  Baja, Carne Asada & more -- for $2 a pop -- oh yeah!  It's probably the only time I'll attend since I can't be hanging with the drunk crowd anymore.  Place was pretty slow for a lunch hour, but I gather it's more for the bar/pick-up/rowdy/sport -- let's dress like hooches place; but I can dig :)  I really enjoyed the hugh panoramic wall mural in the back, think I can sit here for hours having a drink to two (margaritas of course)  Our service was very good.  Nothing like a friendly smile with my tacos - :)  Enjoy!

Mekong Palace is located off Dobson Rd. and Main St. in Mesa.  This food court eatery is located inside the Mekong Plaza shopping center.  Mekong Palace is a trifecta of a restaurant.  During the day they offer up Dim Sum, the evenings it's either classic Chinese dining or Hot Pot!  Dim Sum is what I like to call Asian Tapas.  Dim sum, literally translated, means "touch of the heart." Traditional legend says that women would make dim sum dishes for their husbands before they went off to work.  For this reason, dim sum is very labor intensive, made up of small Bo-Bite-sized pieces (usually served in dishes of 2-4 pieces) with attention to detail; even going so far as lines on dumpling wrappings.  Dim sum is traditionally served for breakfast and lunch and is considered an art form amongst Chinese chefs.   Modern day Dim Sum is served by the waitstaff pushing carts around and in between tables, while patrons view and select the dishes in the carts.  My family and I usually go on Sunday mornings like most Asian families.  I jokingly call this Sunday gathering Chinese Church.  Dim Sum is also called "Yum Cha" or drinking tea since tea is the choice of beverage.  Mekong has all your favorite Dim Sum plates from Siu Mai, Cha Siu Bow, Nah My Guy to Guy Lans and Nai Wong Bows.  Yes, I know, it sounds so foreign, but it's the only way to order it.  No worries, the servers translate all these dishes in English well.   Make sure you bring a Chinese speaking friend.  Not only is it almost a requirement, but makes it more fun, as well.  I love the Dim Sum here not just because the food is great, but because of the atmosphere.  Mekong rocks out on classic Andy Lau, Jacky Cheung, and Vivian Chow music playing while you enjoy a great meal with family and friends.  During the evening, Mekong Palace pumps out great Chinese cuisine.  They have everything from your favorite Kung Pao Chicken to your Sweet and Sour Pork.  However, they also have some great classic authentic Chinese dishes such as Stir-fried Lobster, Mapo Tofu, and my favorite, Stir-fried String beans and pork.    Think that's it?  Well think again!  Mekong Palace also offers up Hot Pot style dining.  Here at Mekong you get your own pot of hot boiling stew and choice of flavor, while cooking your own ingredients made to order; fresh chopped vegetables, round eye beef and diced calamari.  I love eating Hot Pot here since it's very tasty and also very affordable.  At $2-$3 per plate, this place can get you full real quick at a very fair value

Needless to say I don't give much 2 stars out there.  I came here with high hopes since it seem like a swanky Thai joint.  My buddy and I wasn't really hungry so we shared some dumplings to start and the Siamese Fried Rice.    Truthfully, in my point of view the dumplings were like Siu Mai from dim sum.  It had a good pork flavor, but the soy sauce it was sitting on was over salty.  I would start by changing the dumplings since it really wasn't in my viewpoint.  As for the sauce place it on the side and some spice needed.  The Fried Rice was nothing spectacular.  Rice that's fried with dried chicken.  I'm surprised they didn't ask me for the spice level!?  Needless to say, I was highly disappointed.    I would say service was good and so was the ambiance.  However, I'll walk to a new Thai joint next time around. - Enjoy!

I've heard great things about this place.  Thanks Mr. Beckett my expectations were met!    Restaurant Week!  Needless to say, I had the chance to taste all a selection of dishes.  First off, the chopped salad and the chicken meatballs were awesome.  The salad consisted of items I wouldn't think to put in a salad: potatoes, dried cherries, pepitas, variety of vegetables and topped with Champagne Basil Vinaigrette.  Ooof! It was good!  For dinner we ordered the steamed white bass & Meatloaf -- so delicious!  The white bass laid on a salad consisting of spinach & grapes - YUM!  Finally, to top it off dessert!  I'm not a big dessert guy, but dude the pecan pie was amazing!  My partner ordered s'mores.  It had all the elements of a s'more, but the chocolate was bacon dipped chocolate --- BACON DIPPED CHOCOLATE!  Who thinks of that!  Needless to say, it was to die for -- I licked the plate clean, nom nom!  The service was good and our waiters were constantly making sure we were fine.  I really appreciate that and plus they give you glass bottle of water so you'll never run out.  If you ever go out with me I drink a lot of water during my meals!    Ambience was perfect; it was like a wine lounge with an open kitchen.  Low lighting and fresh plant life on the tables -- oh is it spring yet!  - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Madonna - Like A Virgin)  I made it to the restaurant Somehow I'm made to Yelp..... Didn't know how lost I was Until I found you  I want to eat in Phoenix I'd been had, I was hungry and blue But you made me feel Yeah, you made me feel Happy and full  Beckett's Table Tried for my very first time Beckett's Table When Bo Bites eats  Next to rhyme!   Beckett's Table is located in the heart of what I call a food mecca!  Next to Crudo's, the Market by Jennifer's and The Vig.  Anyways, I came here for a quick dinner bite with some friends.  My partner and I decided to share since we weren't that hungry.  We went for the House Made Ricotta Berry Salad and the Tuscan Shrimp.  Needless to say, the salad was well plated and an artwork to look at.  Eat with your eyes first they say and indeed we did.  The salad was plated more like a charcuterie board with a sweet strawberry puree dotted on the side; we mixed it with the arugula and spiced pistachios and soft semi-goowy ricotta cheese.  Overall, a good start to wet the palate for things to come!  Our entree came as a soup; shrimp, sausage, roasted tomatoes and beans and atop with a parmesan crustini.  I thought this dish was good, but it was nothing too exciting.  I thought it needed some heat and some extra crunch.  I appreciated the beans, but later thought I need some more texture.    In the end, Beckett's Table is still a place that deserves my love.  I love the rustic American feel and open kitchen.  The place is warm and welcoming. Service seems knowledgeable and definitely on top of things -- I drink a lot of water and not once was my water glass empty! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Murray Head - One Night In Bangkok)  One dines at Soi Bangkok and the world's your oyster The bars are temples but the drinks ain't free You'll pick a rice with every entree plate And if you're hungry then the get a small plates please I can eat my eggrolls and the Yelping is up to me!   I've been here several years ago and back then I totally dig this place.  Needless to say, I still dig this place!    The restaurant is very well laid out and beautifully put together.  Service here is top notch and very helpful.  For our food we ordered the Calamari to start.  Overall, plating here is not lacking in any way and let's just say and the calamari itself was very meaty and crunchy atop a bed of grilled onions and carrots.  I didn't really care for the sweet and sour sauce it came with but that's just me.  For my entree I went for the BBQ chicken with green papaya salad and rice.  Needless to say, I was surprised to see it was half a chicken served with side of salad and rice.  Chicken was cooked to perfection and I had to bring half of it home.  I think next time I would have ordered something else like my two friends who ordered the Salmon served with red curry and crispy catfish with vegetables.  My favorite was probably the catfish; crispy to the bite and with a hint of curry spice and ginger.  The salmon was different cause I've never had it served with red curry, but it totally worked.    In the end, Soi 4 Bangkok Eatery is a must go if you're interested in traditional and new school Thai style cuisine.  Beautiful setting with good eats! - Enjoy!

True, it is food.  What kind and how it taste?  Well let's break it.  We ordered the Shrimp Spring Rolls to start.  It was bland, but with the sauce it had some kick. Next up, the Kale salad...mmmm kale with a splash of lemon - the fairest of them all!  I'll pass on the poison apples - it's not good for my health. Finally, we ordered the Turkey Bolognese. It was undercooked pasta with ground turkey....huh. Overall, I thought I could have made all this at home and probably taste the same, and I'm no Chef.  Service was good, everyone seemed relaxed and I wasn't sure if I should have busted out my Yoga mat with this crowd (Namaste) - Ambience was loud and very green. Almost too pretentious - "We're green and healthy, eat this food, it's like hugging a polar bear." Don't get me wrong I'm all for the environment, but I like Pandas better haha - Enjoy!

Sa Bai!  Have a drink!  I don't know if I used it in proper context, but hey I'm telling the story!  Well during my visit to the auto mechanic, had to wait for my car so I decided to take a stroll.  Lone and behold I ran into this delightful place.  They even explain what Sa Bai means right on their sign.  I decided from there I needed to eat lunch plus I love Thai food.  Came in and I was greeted with a smile and I knew -- oh yeah...this is gonna be good.  I sat at the bar, but it was tad bit early for a drink (plus I had too much last night) I always order the fried rice noodles at Thai restaurants -- I believe this makes or breaks a Thai joint -- Stir Fried Rice noodles w/ Chicken.  It came out so quick I thought I was at McThai-Food!  Though I know it was freshly made since it was steaming and the veggies were so colorful.  Result = smile on my face and a happy belly -- Burp!  Sa Bai indeed!  As for the ambience (Sa Bai dude!) -- it was definitely a fast food restaurant before, but they did well with their decors - lots of sunlight with a Bombay look.  Let's just say I walked back to the auto mechanic forgetting about why I was there in the first place. - Enjoy!

Sunshine Moon Peking Pub -- say it real fast and it might sound like you're speaking Chinese :)  I can't say this is authentic cause my mom would kick my ass.  However, I must admit the food here is pretty good.  I had their special of the night Seabass dish -- Yum and done right!  I can't say their appetizers were to die for but I'll live.  The other dishes we ordered were your typical Asian-American fusion cuisine - Mongolian Beef and General Tso Chicken -- Who is General Tso?  Anyways, the ambience is pretty relaxing and chill.  Chinese writings on the pillars...well maybe they ripped some random pages from a book and started writing - "it make sense no"  Service was great our waiter was kicking butt and kung paoing along the way -- whatever that means - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Pink - Try)  Ever wonder about what Tryst cafes about How it all turns heads Sometimes I think that it's better to never ask why  Where there is hunger There is gonna be a flame Where there is a flame Someone's burger gonna get grilled But just because it's organic Doesn't mean you're gonna die You've gotta get up and Tryst, and Tryst, and Tryst Gotta get up and Tryst, and Tryst, and Tryst You've gotta get up and Tryst, and Tryst, and Tryst  Bring it on -- Burger!  Tucked away from the Desert Ridge scene is this cute organic restaurant!  Wonders of this fantasy restaurant were once thought to be non-existing.  However, with my Google map I was able to local this mystic place!  Yes, Organic Restaurants do exist!     I came here for lunch and ordered the "Bring it on Burger"!  Boy was it tasty! Mozzarella cheese, pesto and capicolla ham -- uh! Yummy!  It had just the right amount of sweetness to it where it didn't over power all the other ingredients. Add some sweet potato fries and you're golden Ponyboy!   Their beef burger is fresh and juicy too.  Yes, that's the name of the burger, not just trying to name off the ingredients.  It comes with lettuce and tomatoes between a brioche bun.  Tryst brings an energetic vibe to the North side of the valley.  In 2010, Tryst Café was named Best New Restaurant by Phoenix New Times!  They have live music on chosen nights.  At first sight it looks like a basic café, but as you venture in you'll notice a uniqueness about this place.  A full bar that serves a delectable breakfast and great tasting burgers.  Pancakes and beers sounds a like a different combination and yes you can definitely get both here. - Enjoy!

Kinda far from civilization, but it's all good.  Gotta eat inside the tree room!  The room is amazing - according to the waiters and one of the owner, everything was imported from oversees.  I didn't order sushi, but I did get the Hong Kong style noodles and Seafood Tofu Soup -- Mmm, yes both times hit the spot.  Aromatic and tasting at the same time -- what's not to like!  Our service was outstanding, small or a large crowd is not a problem.  Will save this place in my pocket for next time :) (Shout-out to Jay, Shane, & Stephanie!) - Enjoy

Wow!  Let's just say they didn't hold back spending money on this place.  All the glam, lights, and posh; there was not one spot they missed.  I can appreciate that, but just make sure your service and food can say the same.  I like a menu that doesn't try to go around the globe and try to fit everyones tastes.  Kudos, menu option was straight and to the point.  Service wasn't too bad either.  Though I believe the food could have been a tad better espcially for a place like this.  Too much wow - not enough pow for my taste buds. - Enjoy!

I'm all about the food.  Ladies, this place was made to cater to your needs.  Champagne, Tea, and girlfriends.  Think I was one of the only few dudes besides the bartender around.  I like my odds.  I saw a few guys walk in and walk out...haha this isn't their local dive bar I guess.  Narcisse is a chic, modern, and hip.  Plush couches and a high ceiling with hanging decors to attract your eyes.  You know what else attracts your eyes?  Go to the men's room -- you'll see what I mean.  We ordered some appetizers and bruschettas and boy were they yummy!  Meatballs were decent and so were the white Shrimp.  The best was the carpacio!  It literally melts on your palate.  The bruschettas rivals the best in PHX!  They don't crumble when you take a bite and all the toppings stay aboard while you savor the moment. Mmmm...!  Our service was great since there were only 2 in the party plus only a couple of tables.  I gather this place is popping during the weekends.  According to the bartender; the closest thing to a Vegas nightclub.  Hmm, debauchery and immorality! - Enjoy!

Indeed, this Citizen shall enter the House open to the Public!  I ordered the Connelly's Grilled Cheese with little expectations.  Wow! I was surprised with my first bite, savory ham, melted cheddar cheese, and the pickled cherry's to bring in that extra sweet kick.  The crusted toast was a most welcomed texture to my senses.  Well done good Citizen, well done!  We sat at the bar for some drinks (Czech Republic - Pilsner cool!) Service was excellent!  Decors, were really modern, but with a name like Citizen Public House, can't help but the think of the movie Citizen Kane.  "You still eating?": "I"m still hungry!" - Enjoy!

Upper Crust is a neighborhood pizza joint that serves up a New York style pizza.  They have a full bar next that serves up some nice craft brew, but also some nice tasting whiskey (Johnny Blue).    We had a large group of patrons that attended with over 20 people.  Service was on the ball with as many of guest that we had.    I went for a glass of Chanti and ordered the meat trio pizza to share with my friends.  The pizza we ordered was large and all 18 inches was overwhelming for just 3 of us!  I went for the first bite; my take is the ingredients pepperoni, Italian sausage, and meatballs were pretty basic tasting and could probably order from another place and wouldn't know the difference.  The crust was a tad bit burnt, but that didn't bother me too much.  My friends ordered their wings and antipasto plate which they seemed to enjoy; either that or they could have been really hungry.  In the end, I didn't really care for the pizza; too basic.  The service was on top of things and the ambiance is really family friendly with a minor sports bar feel with the TV screens hanging from the walls.  If I needed sustenance of pizza for a quick bite then I would shoot for this place, otherwise I'll carry on. - Enjoy!

Cool hot spot ready to explode!  I must give Mr. Fox some credit...he sure knows how to put together restaurant.  I love ABs for its flare and ambience.  I only had the AB Burger, but I tell ya; I looked around at everyone else's plate and was impressed.  Nice plating and delicious all around.  Next time I'm hitting the bar for some HH.  Service was delightful and informative...they're really on the ball.  The place itself has two identities. The front is your basic bar spot and eating area opened to the kitchen; love that!  The back is 2 private rooms with "Edison-like" lighting and "Hollywood-like" lounge seating.  Well placed and so is the restaurant.  Located in CityScape, but also diagonally across from the stadiums this place has the ability to really pop! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Elvis Presley - Heartbreak Hotel)  Well since I got really hungry I found a new place to dwell. Its off Indian School and 56th Street At Kitchen 56  You make me so hungry baby I get so hungry I get so hungry I could die  And although it's always crowded, You still can find some room. Where very hungry foodies Do write away their review  You make me so hungry baby I get so hungry I get so hungry I could die  Kitchen 56 is located at the border of Arcadia and S. Scottsdale.  It has a vintage full service gas station ambient with a modern twist.  Who knew this would work so well!  I attended on a Sunday evening for the all day HH on drinks and live music was a rocking!  It was a lazy Sunday so I ordered me a PBR, yep....yep....yep.  For only $2 a can man that's some cheap fass beer!  Though not much taste I can still appreciate me some PBR and how long it has survived the test of time.  For my entree I ordered their Black Angus burger with fries.  Needless to say, and to my surprise.  It was one damn good fass burger!  Cooked medium and oozing American cheese all over with the fresh crunch of the onions and pickles gave this delectable burger between some butter bread and awesome POW to my palates!  Yummy!  I don't recall talking much that night.    Service was awesome our waiter was quite knowledgeable about the menu plus his recommendations were definitely appreciated.  Can't wait to go back and another round and neither should you! - Enjoy!

BLD = Bo Loves ...... ummm Bo Loves Dis-Place :)  I really do love this place. I first heard of it thru Yelp, but never had the chance to visit since it's far from the land of Scottsdale where I dwell.  Finally made it and boy was I thrilled!  I sat at the bar where Aaron was a great host and kept my drinks full.  I ordered "The Goat Burger" -- Yummy!  Oh serve me a sweet bite: goat cheese, bacon, roma tomatoes, and arugula.  Oh how it pleased my palates. The burger was sweet and the scent of the arugula traveled thru my nostrils with delight.  This was one good burger and I must recommend it!  The place is like a lounge and with an awesome wine rack in the back.  I totally dig the designs and the communal table in the middle.  I recommend sitting at the end of the bar where the table curves around where you can chat with your friends and of course, Aaron, which showed and offered up some of his favorite wines -- Thanks man! - Enjoy!

Cambodian cuisine is definitely not one of those common cuisine you would pick when someone ask, "What you wanna eat?" (Don't say I don't know....!)  However, now you can say how about Cambodian?  Yes, the one and only one Cambodian restaurant in Phoenix is here!  We had a group gathering here for dinner (NAAAP) and the food was delicious!  I can't say the actual name, but I'll use my best Engrish - Beef & Shrimp marinated salad/beef skewers/pot roast soup/fried tilapia topped with mango.  Okay sounds to me like a typical cuisine, but no dude....it was awesome.  Found out Cambodian cuisine is not spicy like I thought it would be.    Our service was great, this when the restaurant was booked by our entire group - Kudos!  Ambience was really homey - I gather if I lived in a Cambodian household that is....  The decors were originally from Cambodia purchased by the owner (Yut).  I didn't want to touch anything; felt like I was in a museum.  Towards the end of the night I start to make dessert - yes "Me" was cooking!  They showed us how and what ingredients.  Needless, to say I didn't perfect the art, but it still passed and was yummy!  Take that Chef Ramsey! - Enjoy!

Talk about lost identity.  I didn't know what to gather from this place.  Rustic old fashion at the bar, but chic and posh at the dinner tables, flat screens on the walls for a Sports bar maybe? (Lost!)  Americana style food, but with a fusion (Southwest?/Italian?).  The Meatball skewers were very good I must say.  If you can't handle the heat, stay off the Jalapeno poppers -- wow!  I should have ordered some milk at the bar! (If I wasn't so lost!)  Service was very good too, but with more servers in the place than patrons; it better be good :)  (I'm still lost!)  Hot staff members can only go so far to make the place more interesting, but it's starting to be such a cliché.  Ambience was pretty chill, but we need more customers to make this place go pop! (Is anybody else lost after reading this?)  - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Bruno Mars - When I Was Your Man)  Same roll but it feels just a little modern now Our food on the menu but it don't sound the same When we Yelp and talk about you, all it does is makes me hungry now Cause my stomach growls a little when I smell your dish  It all just sounds like oooooorrrhh.... Mmm, too hungry, too thirsty to realize That I should've bought me eggrolls And ate some Pho Should've had some spring rolls When I had the chance Take my friends to your restaurant Cause all we wanted to do was make our appetite's dance Now my belly's full And I don't intend to eat anymore....  I was a tad bit skeptical of Rice Paper after hearing about their food and what it was.  It's definitely not your traditional Vietnamese restaurant by any means.   Very modern and artsy with an Americanize menu.    My expectations weren't high needless to say, but I had to try with an open mind and stomach.  In the end, I was pretty blown away.  I really appreciate the food play here with different ingredients added to traditional cuisine.  It was bold and playful at the same time.  Apparently, this is a spring and eggroll kind of restaurant so I ordered their spider and tuna spring roll with a traditional pork eggroll.    Overall, I LOVE SPIDERS!  I don't say that much cause truthfully the creep me out!  The crispiness of the tempura soft shell crab was a perfect combination to my soft and delicate mango, avocado, and vermicelli noodles!  Served with a miso ginger sauce this roll was bangin'!  My tuna spring roll was okay, but definitely sticking to the Spider.  My traditional eggroll was decent nothing to spectacular.    In the end, if you're looking for traditional old school Vietnamese food -- go elsewhere cause Rice Papers new school with some ass kicking springs ready to rock and pop your palates! - Enjoy!

I'm like a Ninja Turtle -- Cowabunga! I can eat pizza everyday!  Master Splinter and I visited Spinato's, a Chicago style pizza joint.  Yum, definitely get the Nicole's Favorite cause it's mines too.  Sorry Nicole, it is now rename (Bo's Favorite) - onions, artichokes, salami, and a delictible pizza sauce -- mmmm.  Ambience was real chill, we sat at the bar area and I totally dig the posh chairs - Not Posh Spice, but I wouldn't mind :)  Our service was great, waitress was fun, knowledgable and helpful come decision time to order. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Tears For Fears - Shout)  Chou's Chou's Xiao Long Bao These are the foods I can't do without Bo Bites I'm singing to you Bo Bites  In hungry times You shouldn't have to settle for more In Chou's Kitchen They really really serve you know Those fried noodles That taste you were always looking for  Kiss them goodbye That made you have to order more That made you have to order for more!   Chou's Kitchen seems to be located in a corner of nowhere-land I call it.  Next to a Mexican restaurant and a Goodwill this place didn't really stick out at first.  As I entered however I was great a familiar "How many" in broken English and I was like; yep this is my kind of joint!  My friends and I sat at the front of the house as I couldn't see much in the back, but I was peppered by the sight of the all the accolades this place has received from Yelp and food writing establishments.  Guess it's Bo Bites turn!  We started with the XLB or #111 at this restaurant and some Beef Pies.  Along the way we ordered our entree, String Beans with Minced Pork, House Fried Noodles, and Pork Ribs w Green Bean, Potatoes & Eggplant Clay Pot.  Overall, the XLB is popping; nice and steaming hot with a pop of juice with every bite.  I would say the best I've had in town for sure!  The Beef Pies were my favorite, it was similar to the XLB, but more crunch from the fried shell and had more meat.  I eat string beans anywhere they make it and this one in particular was the same as many other Chinese restaurants.  None of us really cared for the Clay Pot simply because it just seemed like a mush of cooked stuff.  As for the fried noodles we all felt like it was handmade because of the doughiness of it and would definitely recommend this dish.    In the end, Chou's Kitchen gets my thumbs up.  I had a great experience here and the service was on top of it.  Our server was polite and attentive and I drink a lot of water when I eat and I gathered she saw that so she kept on coming to the table haha!  We loved our XLB so much we ordered second round of that stuff.  Next time I come I might just stick with that and the meat pies! - Enjoy!

I can only handle Greek cuisine once in a while.  Is it me or do you feel heavier and a tad bit overweight after some gyros?  and fries ... and a medium coke? :)  Yeah, I know it's the voices in my head (make them stop!)  Anyways, this place is right in the food court.  I'm not a big fan of food courts in general, but I'll survive.  I thought the gyros were pretty basic.  It wasn't too bad but then again it didn't really wow my taste buds.  Order some hot dogs and hamburgers and you're in the wrong joint (it'll take a good 15 mins!)  This is just one of the 3 locations for this franchise so I gather they do pretty well.  This location is definitely for the quick (I only have 30 mins lunch break) customers.  - Enjoy!

I like Smashburgers and this location is the closet to me.  What can I say I enjoy a good burger and Smashburger delivers to my taste bud. You can order beer here, which I don't think this particular location does well since there are so many kids running around.  Then again it's close to a movie theater and I gather and the teenagers need a place to loiter.    I always order my favorite the Arizona burger with sweet potato fries!  I love the kick it has with the jalapenos and guacamole.  I wonder if each state has it's own burger? - Enjoy!

I was a skeptical about this place simply because I'm not a big fan of Mexican American restaurants.  However, prove me wrong and you shall be rewarded!  Needless to say, Black Chile proved me wrong and I loved it.  I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos, which I thought were amazing.  The beef was tender and the spice was just right.  Chips and salsa for the table was okay at best.  I've had better salsa.  Drinks during HH was decent, I'm going through my whiskey phase.  Beer & wine is good just not that night I attended.  Service was real quick and accommodating.    Ambience had the old rustic western feel.  The room had a Southwestern modern touch.  The crowd was young and hip.  Restrooms were downstairs in an entirely different space, which I thought was pretty cool. - Enjoy!

Not much of a fan of buffets except if it's at a casino.    Red Wok Buffet works only if you're glutton.  Yes, just keep stuffing your face.  I didn't think the food was good obviously.  The only thing I thought was decent was the Teriyaki chicken; nicely glazed with the sauce while fried with crispy edges.  Just the way I like it!  Everything else was bland.  This is what I consider "stay alive" food.  If I needed to survive I'll come eat this stuff, but overall not my favorite buffet place.    The place itself is pretty similar to most Asian buffet restaurants.  Very basic Asian decors to make sure you know you're in an Asian restaurant buffet.  One highlight I guess would be the service was decent. - Enjoy!

What happened to Cafe Carumba!?  Oh well didn't attend that place much anyways.  I don't know who Tommy V is but he sure has style.  Modern sleek look with some Rat Pack portraits on the wall - Ain't that a kick in the head!  I ordered the Pasta Trio which was delicious.  The ravioli's were so soft and creamy!  The only problem I see is the portion size.  I guess I can't complain since I rather enjoy quality over quantity.  However, I also thought it a tad bit pricey for the meals.  They do have a huge selection of wine available.  I think if I come back definitely would be during HH.  Service as real good I really enjoying talking to servers who know about the menu but also the wine.  Say Hi to Zorian when you get there he's one of the owners and is a joy to talk to. - Enjoy!

Hey man, you know I'm really okay The burger in my belly will tell you same And when I review I won't give it crap Cause The Habit's burger got me smiling and full!  I guess I go to the Habit And eating away Gotta go to the Habit And eating way Yeah Yeah! (Lyrics - Offspring - Bad Habit)  The Habit Burger first started out in the beach fronts of Santa Barbara and soon became a popular local burger joint.  I could see why.  Fresh cut vegetables and charbroiled beef patties on an open flame would drive anyone towards this place; I guess you can call it a habit we all have - wink!    I ordered the Double Charburger, with tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, cheese, and toasted bun.  Needless to say sounds pretty basic, but once you sink your teeth into the warm bun and through the sides; you can taste the nice thin crust created from the charred grill while the beef has that perfect moisture.  The cheese adds that extra ooze of salt and savory.  Add a side of onion rings or fries and we're golden!  I generally don't rave too much about chain restaurants, but I must approve the Habit Burger for bringing out the "Bad Habit" of mines; eating a yummy burger!  Sorry love handles!   One of the things I noticed about the Habit Burger Grill is their service.  They are on top of it and know how to sell their menu.  You would order like any other fast food joint, but they seem more passionate and knowledgeable of what they do.  I had a few questions on my first visit and they were all answered.  The server and table attendants were super courteous and friendly.  I appreciate good service since it seem like a dying art, but I make sure to point it out when ever I get a chance.  The Habit has a slight beach flare feel, but definitely a modern diner.  Order at the counter and pick a seat, while extra condiments; peppercini peppers, jalapenos, and pickles are readily available at your own risk haha!  I would recommend The Habit Burger Grill to you and see what the people of Santa Barbara of been raving about for years. - Enjoy!

Called these guys to re-key the business doors.  1st guy comes out and said he's not familiar with these locks.  Fine, I'll wait for the next guy.  2 guys come out the 2nd time re-keys everything is fine right?  WRONG!  The door does not lock at all now.  Usually, takes a turn of the Alan wrench and boom - locks!  Now it doesn't even do that.  Called them out couple more times to have them look at the locks -- Still does not work.  To conclude they call back and said I'll need a new lock...........They can give me some quotes..........  Really, you "re-key" my door and break it and now tell me I need a new lock!?  I guess I shouldn't worry about robbers breaking down the front doors anymore cause they've already came.... supposedly posing as locksmiths.

Prime Auto Glass was professional and courteous!  My company uses the Ford transits and while most auto glass places didn't have the item since the transits were fairly new; Prime Auto Glass was still able to get it for us!    The installer was on time and worked relatively quick and within a couple of hours we had new windshield.  So far it's holding up very well and after a year my windshield is doing dandy. Let's just hope the freeway gods won't chuck another pebble at it anytime soon!    Overall, great service, fast and on time.  We all hate to deal with our car maintenance, but companies like Prime Auto Glass just makes things smoother and easier on all of us! - Enjoy!

Coffee, music, and buur...  I dig this joint!  It's like walking into a brew house with some random people hanging out.  Live music and freshly made coffee.  I have to say one of the best coffees I had in a long time.  I'm no coffee snob by any means, but shazam! This coffee hit the spot and punched me in the face "in a good way -- if there's such a thing as getting punched in the face, but enjoying it....", and woke my senses up!   What else is cool and I dig about Cartel is you can order alcoholic beverages.  Coffee and Beer -- Aside from water, my two most sought after and preferred drinks!  Cartel is like my kryptonite - I must succumb to your bidding....must be strong and ahhhh...more more coffee, more more, pleasssse! - Enjoy!

This was a real random visit.  My friends walked by and saw this place and said they would return.  Knowing me very well, they told me about this "new" place they stumbled upon.    A gem it was! Exotic ingredients they had, but since we're in AZ, which has the tendency not to have an open palate; they had no choice, but to give up the beef heart and tendon dish.  Booooo!  Hopefully, it comes back someday since their menus change up daily.  We ordered some drinks, but they didn't have any Kronenbourg beer!  Not to worry, our great serve gave me another option - Kudos! If you don't have it give me options!  He offered me a Forst from Italy I guess and I totally appreciated it!  That's service my friend and to be on the ball our drinks and food came all at the right timing.    We ordered the Grande Antipasto and boy was it grand!  Took a picture, which is rare.  I never take pictures of my dishes, but this was a worth a shot and worth the purchase.  I'm not too familiar with the cheeses, but it was good!  We also ordered a Carne Pizza -- meaty indeed it was and the dough was soft and yummy!    Overall, food and service was A+ in my book.  I think the only thing I would switch up is the furniture.  The chairs were not comfortable.  However, the ambience was real relaxing and chill.  Some class and a tad bit of home feeling. - Enjoy!

Strange Love, strange highs and strange lows Strange Love, that's how my love goes (Depeche Mode)  However, you won't give me pain!   Strange, this place was located in a strip mall area next to a Starbucks and theater.  I look at this from a positive standpoint because of the high traffic.  Sushi, coffee, and then a movie!  They had a great looking website, but that generally doesn't tell the story.  Strange, ingredients on the menu. Geoduck, giant clams, and round clams, not my typical dinner cravings, but let's just say I'm not too shy to try. I don't have a PhD yet (Doctorate in Phood!), but I was impressed.  My two dinner associates are quite knowledgeable about their sushi and they help educate me in that field. Round Clam 3 different ways they rave - Nigiri, Sashimi and Fried -- Ding & Wink!  I dig their Geoduck since its such a rare item to eat fresh and uncooked!  However, being non-sushi connoisseur; my favorite - the salmon wrapped avocado; which you can see on Yelp Photos.  Strange? No, it's not so strange after all. It's definitely worth a try and totally recommend HMS - stop by and say hi to Steve he's a cool fish :) - Enjoy!

Here's why you should go -- Their pull pork sandwich is very good!  House specialty BBQ is very good!  Fries are good!  Here's why you shouldn't go and all of you out there that ever worked in the food industry can relate.  Don't treat your employees like Poop! Especially, not in front of me or any other patrons of the restaurant.   Story: We place our order with the counter gal and she relays the message one at a time to Ric. Ric yells, "How bout you tell me how many burgers total instead of telling me one by one"!  Then asked everyone else in the restaurant "Does anybody else want a burger!" while shaking his head. The gal was mortified and was holding back her tears. I felt bad! I felt so uncomfortable sitting there eating. Needless to say my burger was over spiced and too salty!  Why? I ask would you do such a thing!?  Does it make him feel empowered by such actions!?  It was uncalled for!  You, yes you out there that ever worked in an environment with a crappy boss knows what I mean.  Overall the food was pretty good, but in the end Ric left a bad taste in my mouth! - Enjoy!

From what I know the Chef from Szechwan Palace left to open Szechwan Garden -- talk about a punch in the gut!  Pow!  The food here is pretty authentic and tasty.  Very spicy I might add so if you're a lightweight please step aside.   We ordered the Mapo Tofu, Fried Green beans, some sort of fried rice noodles that was dipped in a brown sauce (I didn't order this one my friend did so I don't know what it's called haha) Finally, my favorite fried Frog Legs in a medley of vegetables - Yum!  It was my favorite of them all.  Frog Legs are small but very meaty.  Plus, the spice they cooked it in was delicious!   Service was pretty good since my friend was a regular and I think they know her by name.  Oh the perks!  What I like about this place is that it reminds me of those old Chinese restaurants back in LA.  No uniforms and the staff ate their lunch next to us :)  The decors could use a modern touch, but the tackier the better I guess - Enjoy!

This was a try out for my mates and I.  We drove by and say let's do it!    Walking towards the building we joked about the poor special signage posted. Looked like some 5th grader had quite a project to spruce up the place up. We walked in and needless to say the place was worst than barren desert. Except for a couple of guys at the counter top bar. Wait! What bar? They didn't serve alcohol - are you sure this place is an Italian restaurant?  Needless to say maybe they're working on getting their license.  We sat down on the booth and ordered a pizza. As we waited classic Italian music and knowing we were the only customers in the building was TORTURE! The only thing that kept us sane was Words with Friends on our Iphones.   Our pizza finally came and with some paper plates we're ready! I must admit the pizza was pretty good for what we've experience so far. I think with an alcohol license and some spicing up of the place it'll do great.  However, we need more patrons than just my two buds and me. I hope they do well in the future - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Chumbabwamba - Tubthumping)  I get Thirsty so I go to the Lion's Pub They're always happy to see me around I get Thirsty so I go to the Lion's Pub They're always happy to see me around I get Thirsty so I go to the Lion's Pub They're always happy to see me around I get Thirsty so I go to the Lion's Pub They're always happy to see me around  (Yelping the night away, Yelping the night away) I try a chicken dish, I try a some nachos I try the flatbread , I try a slider dish I sing the songs they play on the screens that remind me of the good times I sing the songs they play on the screens that remind me of the best times (Oh Bo Bites, Bo Bites, Bo Bites)  Thirsty Lion Pub & Grill is located on the far West side of Tempe Marketplace.  It's location is perfect from what I gather away from the movie going crowd and food court area.  Standing alone next to Kabuki; the restaurants is super spacious with a large patio with a fire pit.  Perfect for the cooler nights and not a bad idea for the warmer nights to just enjoy people watching.  No not like that Inspector Gadget; no stalking allowed!    I like coming to the Thirsty Lion during the late hours for HH.  They have a great selection of beers and the food is pretty damn good.  I love the nachos here!  Extra crispy with avocados, beans, and cheese.  Pretty basic, but they pile that stuff on like there's not tomorrow; eat up damn it!  They're bar nachos during HH is pretty awesome too.  They call them pub chips, or potato chips so they're extra thick and you're able to scoop up the bacon, cheese, onions, and tomatoes.  The saltiness and crunch goes well with a cold bitter tasting beer!  Yum on a warm night!  I'm not a fan of the flatbread or main entrees so I generally stick with the bar food and burgers, which again is on the HH menu and bar menu.    Overall, pretty chill ambience on a game-less night.  They rock out on music videos, that yes, reminds me of the good times and reminds me of the best times! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Tears for Fears - Everybody Wants to Rule the World)  Welcome to North Fattoria There's no turning back Even while we eat We will find you at the bar for Happy Hour Buy a drink and some bruschetta Everyone should try North Fattoria  It's my own decision It's my own review Help you to decide Help you make the most Of eating and of pleasure Nothing ever taste this good Everyone should try North Fattoria  North Fattoria Italiana, almost a mouth full trying to say it.  Either that or I'm busy stuffing my face!  NFI is a Sam Fox Restaurant so you know the ambience is awesome!  I've never felt out of place every time I go to any of his restaurants.  NFI is laid out like an old Italian kitchen.  Like mama's home cooked meal I say!  Lots of vintage lighting and an open patio.  I believe the garage doors open during the cooler months for a fresh breeze to run through the restaurant -- mmm nice!    I came to NFI several times and their HH is very good.  Wine and dine at the bar with some flatbreads cause it's my favorite.  I ordered "The Pig"  and it was a bunch of pork, but man you know; that's what I like!  No skimping the protein here!  Nice warm and cheese crust, while can add some crushed pepper to give it some kick!  Perfect with "ma ber"!  Their pasta is good too so don't for get to leave some room before you come.  I ordered their regular spaghetti and meatballs and lets just say it's my favorite in town!  The sauce taste like it's made from scratch while the meatballs, well meatballs to me are meatballs, but the sauce is what really makes a pasta dish.  In the end, I was delighted with my meals and the atmosphere was perfect to just relax and enjoy a few drinks before departing. - Enjoy

(Lyrics - Prince - 1999 - Party Like It's 1999)  I was eating when I wrote this Forgive me if it goes astray But when I wrote up this review I could have sworn it was happy day  The place was full of people There was a bottle of vino everywhere Trying to figure what to order You know I didn't even care  They say two cocktails vodka, vodka Party over Oops, just on time So tonight I'm gonna party at Vintage 95   Vintage 95 in the little hot spot of downtown Chandler. I love this location and always enjoy coming to Chandler away from the crazy crowd of Scottsdale.  Vintage 95 is wine bar that serves up some contemporary American style food with local and fresh ingredients. The place itself is beautifully put together; classical mansion style! I came with a date and we started with looking at their drink menu. Vintage 95 has a awesomely constructed wine room with a chandelier to show it off! My dated ordered a cocktail drink while I just shot for the Tempranillo. For out food we started with the Artisan board with aged Gouda, Prosciutto, pickles, salted almonds, bread, grapes, and crostinis with a strawberry jam. Overall, a solid start to my wine; the aged Gouda was solid cheese, but perfect texture to mix with our pickles and cured meat. The strawberry jam was totally fresh and meshed well with our bread and crostini. For our entrees, my date ordered the Flatiron Steak while I went for the Pork Chops. Both protein was cooked to perfection, which we both ordered medium. The brussel sprouts was excellent according to my date whom doesn't really eat brussel sprouts. My pork chops has a perfect sweet bite because of the roasted cherry tomato and lemon mustard cream while the texture was slightly chewy. It came along with an over-easy egg too!  In the end, Vintage 95 is definitely one of my go to spots or my "ace" when it comes to places to recommend. - Enjoy!

OHHHHH SOOOO Eatery! I'd be so hungry if I left you now Cause I don't know where to look for Brews I just don't know how!  OHHHHH SOOOO Eatery! How I depend on you To give me Brews when I need it right on time for Happy Hour! (Lyrics - The Chi-Lites - Oh Girl)  OH! SO good and worth your time.  At first glance I didn't know what this place was.  I made my stop across the street at JT's.  Finally, I'm glad a made a stop here.  Felt like walking into a neighborhood bar that was full of . . . well . .  my neighbors!  They have a pretty awesome back patio, but that's not to say that the front is lacking.  Dogs are welcomed up front to hang with patrons. The place itself seemed pretty retro and had that summer camp feel.  They have a huge selection of micro brews and what totally weirded me out was how the bartender remembers which brew was in which tap, since there were no signs or logos attached.  Just plain taps!  Kudos to the person that has to remember all of it!    I ordered a burger with cheese and a side of fries.  My friends ordered the antipasto platter which came with Elk meat -- cool!    My burger was totally awesome with the bacon and cheese.  The patty was nice and juicy while the cheese just oozed over it nicely.  The bun was nice and soft and don't forget to order some nice and crispy fries on the side.  Overall and the bread they used was definitely larger and doughy compared to what I was used to.  The antipasto platter was great and came with honey mustard and some sort of salsa like sauce.  The meats and pickled veggies was what made it delicious!  Never had elk but wasn't bad at all.  The pickled veggies were pungent and hit up my sinuses where it need to.  Overall, good start and good experience - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Color Me Badd - I Wanna Sex You Up)  Come inside, go make a call, they'll make you feel at home Now let's pour a glass of wine 'cause now we're all alone I've been waiting all night so just let me know when your ready for me Cause I've been dying for your drinks and mixology......  Oh you make me feel real  We can drink it till we both fill up Oh you know I'm hooked on you And this is what I'll do...  Let's go to the R&D All night Oh you make me feel real good. Let's go to the R&D  Shhhh......yep the one and only speakeasy in the valley that I know of and it's here in the heart of Oldtown Scottsdale.   I came here on a Thursday night with a gal pal of mine and we were so excited!  Get the rules at the host desk and give them a buzz for instructions to the location; which is upstairs from the restaurant.  As we waited for short period of time downstairs before the mixologist called and escorted us up.  The place was pretty swanky with a minimal feel.  Meaning there wasn't too much to look at, but some framed portraits and some couches.    I ordered the Fallen Angel; aged rum, pineapple juice, watermelon, habanero, honey, eggwhites, and Saigon cinnamon.  Overall, the favorite of the night!  I don't drink a lot of mixed drinks, but I can down this one anytime and all the time.  The sweetness of the honey and the juices gave it a sweet and sour punch, while the habanero spice gave this drink some pop!  Yummy and yummy again for my next visit!  My friend ordered the Fear & Loathing Mezcal Margarita; in the end it was more show than anything and I didn't care for it!   Along the way we ordered their Crab Cakes and their Tuffled Grilled Cheese.  The Crab Cakes were done just right, but we didn't care for the coleslaw.  Their smoked red pepper aioli gave it a nice kick.  The Truffled Grilled Cheese was awesome!  We asked for extra tuffle oil and it really made the sandwich taste 10 times better!  Crunchy, aromatic, and gooey, this grilled cheese sandwich is definitely one of my favorites in town! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Billy Ocean - Caribbean Queen)  She served me drinks during Happy Hour And all heads turned cause it was Patron In one bite of her dish I knew the rating and the name yeah Ah they said I was the Yelper they wanted to tame  Barrio Queen Now we're sharing the same drink And Bo Bites I'll rate them number one No more hunger on the run   Barrio Queen is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  I've heard many great things about their food and I was even here for the Yelp Elite event gathering.  Though I only reviewed the event itself; I had to come back to do my own review.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I came here after an art and wine gathering with some friends.  The wait for our seating wasn't too long and overall the place was popping!  On one side a full bar and the other another bar with dining area and patio.  The place we decorated with a Dia de Morte theme and old Mexican style setting.    I shot for the House Margarita to start as my mates order some appetizers -- Barrio Guacamole; which is made right at your table.  Fresh avocado and pomegranite to your thick and chunky style guacamole is definitely a treat and delight in my book!  I would recommend everyone to start with it!   I was debating on a street taco since I had it during the Yelp Elite party and found it pretty darn tasty and street indeed.  However, I shot for the Torta with their signature dish Cochinita Pibil; their award winning banana leaf wrapped and slow cooked pork with sour orange, pickled onions, and pico de gallo.  This torta had some pop!  Warning! The green chili atop is extremely butt kicking hot.  Taste at your own risk!  Overall I think you can put the pulled pork in a torta or a tortilla cause it would have worked.  It was that just darn good and delicious!    In the end, Barrio Queen was a hit and I would definitely welcome and recommend this gem anytime to anybody. - Enjoy!

5 Stars, I can't say they have the best food in town or any good food.  Some people rave about their wings....really...seriously!?  Anyways.....  However, this location does get 5 stars for one reason -- Service!  They were very gracious in accommodating my large party.  Especially, on a free UFC fight night like they have!  Yes, free UFC here!  They went above and beyond what they had to do and they my friends; that's an A+ regardless of their food -- I'll eat your wings because you're awesome!  The place wasn't packed and I was sitting alone at my table.  I told the manager my group is coming I swear, but when he told me it doesn't matter as long as I'm happy -- you damn right I'm happy; hit me with another pint!  Their staff overall was very friendly and accommodating, but maybe it's for better tips.  In the end, it didn't matter thanks for the smile and great service!  The girls here are pretty sexy, but I must say I think overall Hooters need to change up their outfit.  I dig the signature white tee, orange daisy dukes, and ankle high socks, but I didn't grow up in the 70's!  Need to revamp the outfit and menu I think, but hey with service and free UFC fights -- I'll keep coming back! - Enjoy!

HA ha ha HA ha HA ha ha HA ha he he he he he he he he he....... (Woody Woodpecker)  For those of you old enough to know the Woody Woodpecker this place is a like an homage to the character.   The only way you'll find this gem is by catching the eyes of the woodpecker off Indian School Rd.  At first sight you wouldn't think much of this place from the outside.  Once you enter it's a nice cozy chill atmosphere.  I'm glad this place is here far from the party scene of S. Scottsdale.  Everyone seems pretty relaxed and open.  They're not here to impress anyone; they're here to have a good time.  The place in general is covered in "wood" and has a cabin look.  Thus, the "woody" part makes sense.    Moving, past the main doors and towards the back and going West of the building is the game room.  Tad bit odd for a lounge, but totally awesome.  Shuffle boards, skeet ball and darts in the back room while you have a drink with your best buds in case you didn't want to just sit around at the bar.  The large LCD TVs shows the game of the night while you sit back and enjoy.   The Woody also serves up some cozy comfort food.  My buddy and I ordered the tomato soup with grilled cheese sandwich.  I wasn't too awed about the sandwich, but the toast on it made sense to my palate as I dipped it into the roasted tomato soup.  The soup was delicious!  I pounded it down with a couple of drinks and my night was complete! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Phil Collins - In The Air Tonight)  I can taste it going to Bianco tonight, Bo Bites And I've been waiting for this location to open all my life, Bo Bites Can you taste going to Bianco tonight, Bo Bites, Bo Bites  Well, if you told me you were hungry I would lend a hand I've seen your appetite before my friend But I hope you know who I am  Well, I was there and I saw what you did I saw it with my own two eyes So you can wipe off your mouth I know what you've eaten It's all been a plate of pies (pizza)  Came here for a quick HH drinks with a buddy!  However, when in Pizzeria Bianco you have to order a pizza!  It would be sacrilegious not to!  I'm not too fond of the draft selections since there were only 2, but I guess I shouldn't expect too much from a wine and pizza joint.  We ordered the Margarita Pizza.  Overall, it was pretty good - firewood baked pizza pie in a stone oven; you really can't beat that quality!  The aroma of the basil, the stringy mozzarella cheese, and the sweetness of the tomato sauce is enhanced by the toasty smell of the firewood! Yum!    The service was very good!  There were several people that attended to us, but seem like they were all in sync and willing to help to make our experience so much better!  The place itself is different from the one downtown.  This one had more of a farm home feel with a touch of spring!  In the end, a must visit next time your around the Biltmore area! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Aerosmith - Janie's Got A Gun)  Yum, Yum, Yum, Tommy what have you done? Yum, Yum, Yum, it's the Stack I want Yum, Yum, Yum, Tommy what have you done? Yum, Yum, Yum, It's for Yelp....  Tommy's got a thumb Tommy's got a thumb The Yelp world's gonna come Yelping from the valley of the sun Spice meat rubbing too! Cinnamon bun rolling through! They said when Bo Bites was a coming they asked him write a song with some fun! But man, a car wash a comin' Now that Tom's Thumb gotta Stack, I'm never gonna eat the same.....!  I've always came here for a Yelp event, but finally got my chance for lunch one fine day!  Who'd ever guess there would be good food at a car wash....yeah a car wash!   I had to order the Tom's Thumb Stack; made to order only!  Definitely a recommend from this happy patron!  The stack comes with a bed of crispy hash browns, topped with a beef brisket, over easy egg, and drizzled with a chipotle mayo aioli.  I love the crunch of the hash browns while the smokiness of the brisket provides a welcoming aroma!  Also, what doesn't go well with an over easy egg a topped!?  I usually add the habanero bbq sauce to give this awesome dish and extra kick to finish my meal!    In the end, Tom's Thumb is a must visit, whether for a car wash, good eats, or just checking out it's knicks and knacks they have displayed.  They also have a fine bakery, which they make fresh cinnamon rolls every morning!  I guess you can say it's like an all in one stop shop for your belly! - Enjoy!

Postinos on the East side!?  Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to Postinos, oh yeah It's closer to the truth to say I can't get enough  You know I'm gonna have to face it, I'm addicted to Postinos   Thanks Robert Palmer and let's just say I wouldn't be surprised to see the fashion models around here.  Very attractive crowd!  I am honor just to be here!    Another bottle of wine and you'll be mine, a one track mind  I can't be saved  4 flavors of Bruschetta is all I crave  If there's some left for you  and don't mind if I do   I might as well face it I'm addicted to Postinos  I've always enjoyed attending Postinos on the West side of town, but the East side adds a new flavor.  The place still has a great deal on Monday and Tuesday nights.  Bottle of wine plus a large plate of bruschetta's for $20!  The ambience is always chill and low lighting.  Quite romantic and add some pretty ladies and I'm golden here!  Service is always great at Postinos.  The staff is definitely well train in the knowledge of wine and their service is spectacular! - Enjoy!

Quick stop quick munch at Ike's Cook Shack!    I ordered their special that day Pork Chops, eggs, and hash browns.  Mmmm who can pass up pork chops for breakfast!?  This Yelper can't!  Overall, probably one of the juicier and tastier pork chops I've eaten for awhile.  Super tender and just enough salt and pepper added.  The eggs and hash brown were the side and didn't care for them much.  My buddy ordered their oatmeal and the other eggs and bacon.  Bacon was great, but the oatmeal was tad bit too dry.    The place itself is made out like a cabin.  Nice quaint and homey feel.  The service; well it's good home cooking a good old fashion hospitality.  Great experience and must if you're ever in Wickenburg! - Enjoy!

Papa Chevo's was a quick stop from an outing night for me.  Though I was still coherent so no excuses on my part.  Place was dead, but being the night was still young I'm sure this place can get overwhelmed.  I ordered the beef Sopes with rice and beans.  Overall, nothing to special in my Mexican food repertoire.  I thought it was pretty simplistic and what I would expect; Fried corn tortilla, topped with refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.    In the end, I thought it was nothing out of the box, but something I can ingest if I was really hungry. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Ricky Martin - Livin La Vida Loca)  I'm into carne tacos hot sauce and horchatas I taste a quesadillas that place's gonna make me smile I'm into new sensations new foods in the Phoenix streets I've got a new addiction for every day and night  It'll make you take our clothes off and go dancing in the club It'll make you live that crazy life but it'll take away your hunger pain like a bullet to your brain. Come On!  Upside, inside out I'm hitting up a Taqueria I'll eat and drink some down, hitting up a Taqueria It's lines are crazy long and it's sauce is color Roja I will wait you it out hitting up a Taqueria....come on! Hitting up a Taqueria, come on! I'm hitting up a Taqueria.   Probably one of the best taco shops I've had in a long time especially in Phoenix.    Taqueria is a taco food truck parked right outside of a night club.  Overall, it's pretty darn tacky in my point of view, but damn does it work!  Lines here can get really crazy and long plus when it's summer time; it's just darn redonkulous!    Needless to say, it was worth it!  For only $1 a pop these tacos were amazingly good!  I ordered 5 Carne tacos which came with beef, onions, cilantro, and salsa.  Basic to the point, but that's how it should be!  Sprinkle some lime atop and let your palates sing.  I didn't even use the salsa that came along with it since I thought it was pretty tasty without it.  The corn tortillas was soft and warm wrapping the tender beef, while the onions provide a hint of crunch.  The cilantro was aromatic while the lime and salsa ended your final bite with a sour and spicy punch!    In the end, Taqueria is not located in the best spot in town, but it's definitely worth a visit at least once regardless. - Enjoy!

You'd think a place with Chef Gordon Ramsay's name would be overpriced and pretentious.  Well, you got one of them right!    Yeah sure price is high, but in Vegas it's money money money!  I felt perfectly comfortable walking in here and the service was top notch.  My buddy and I sat at the bar and ordered some drinks.  The bartender recommended the American Wagyu Cap Rib.  So we went for it and along with side of sauteed mushrooms and haricot vert.  Needless to say, the sauteed mushrooms was nice and warm to the palate with a slight sweet and garlic taste.  The haricot vert was pretty much tempura style.  The highlight of the night was the wagyu steak...ooo--weee!  The best bite of any steak I've ever taken!  Tender, juicy, and a hint of salt and spice...definitely a recommendation on my end and Bo Bites favorite. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Scott McKenzie - San Francisco)  If you're go to Del Frisco's Grille Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair If you're go to Del Frisco's Grille You're gonna get some good service there  For those who come to Del Frisco's Grille Summertime will be a love-in there (because of the nice patio!) Across streets of Biltmore is the Del Frisco's Grille Gentle people with flowers in their hair  Del Frisco's Grille looks pretty swanky from the outside.  Free valet parking is always a plus in my book I tell ya!  This place overlooks Camelback Rd. and the Biltmore fashion so sitting on the patio is not a bad idea; unless it's 100 plus degrees outside!  Inside Del Frisco doesn't hold back on decor and the ambience of a modern winery with modern furniture.  I would say very professional appeal after a days work selling stock and crap.  Is it a bull market today; nope just a donkey!  I ordered me a Grille Prime Cheeseburger; the plating was of the dish was like street food to me, but that didn't bother me.  I can appreciate street food in a swanky restaurant.  However, it was nothing like a street burger.  I enjoy my fair share of burgers and this I didn't care for.  For what I was paying I rather go to In & Out; matter of fact let's go!  It just wasn't anything special.  My partner ordered their Ahi Tacos with a lettuce shell instead of tortilla; again nothing too special, but what really mattered to me were they were willing to help her out with going carb-less.  Kudos to the bartender; whom was the highlight of the night!    Needless to say, service was not lacking here at all.  Our bartender kept her cool during rough dealings with customers and co-workers it seems and that my friend is what makes a good employee!  Promotion here please! - Enjoy!

Excuse me Morpheus is calling --- Yes I don't think the Machines really know what good food taste like --- Yes, yes, yeah I know chicken haha!  Silly Machines!  I say this in a good way.  Osaka, Japan, or Mesa, Arizona, Close enough right?  Let's not get too carried away!  Osaka Japanese Steakhouse is a Teppanyaki restaurant so don't forget to make your reservations!  Yes, this place can get full real especially during dinner hour on the weekends.   OJS, serves up a modern Japanese cuisine.  The decors are very elegant, yet has a traditional appeal.  The place itself has a real contemporary feel.  Think Matrix with Japanese flare!  Minus, Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity, though I wouldn't mind seeing some butt kicking action.    I ordered the Yakisoba with Ramen noodles and beef.  Let's just say it literally looked like the opened up a bag of ramen and stir-fried it with some beef.  It was really bland, but luckily my friend had a packet of spicy sauce in her purse.  Yeah, I know in her purse!  I had to douse it with some soy sauce to give it an extra saltiness and I never add soy sauce to anything!  Needless to say, my noodles were under par.  I think I could have made it myself and I don't cook.  I don't know about their Teppanyaki, but if it's anything like their noodles then I don't think I'll be making reservations anytime soon. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - MAGIC! - Rude)  Saturday evening jumped out to Yelp And put on my best suit Got in my car and raced like a jet All the way to you  Came to your door with food in my mind To order from your menu Cause I know that you're in Restaurant Week, yeah  Can I have your Risotto for the rest of my life? Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know You say I'll always get my blessing til the day I write Good luck, my friend, but answer is Bo Bites  Why you gotta go to Crud...o's Don't you know I'm hungry too? Why you gotta go to Crud...o's I'm gonna Bo Bites anyway!   Crudo's has had quite a reputation in the valley and needless to say I had to make my visit on Restaurant Week!    The place itself is oddly located, but that didn't bother me much.  I came on a rainy Saturday night with my partner in crime.  She's the one and only @ssuze photo extraordinaire on Instagram!  She shoots the pictures and I write!  We both ordered the 4 course meal.  We started with the Albacore with Truffle Watermelon rind and black pepper and the Yellowtail, Controne, Bottanga, Chive.  Needless to say, I don't know what the heck it means, but boy was it a perfect start.  Eating sashimi with a kick of sweet and aromatic seasoning.  Next was the cheese dishes; Burrata-Pancetta Vin, Arugula and the Ricotta Walnut sauce, and Honey.  I would say this is my least favorite course since I'm not much of a cheese guy.  However, both dishes worked!  Sweet honey and creamy ricotta cheese mix over bread; who knew would taste great.  The Arugula gave the Burrata cheese a nice subtle taste.  Next was the entree round, we went for their famous Squid ink risotto and their pork belly smoked tomato Agrodolce Polenta.  I see why their it's known in town as the Famous Squid ink Risotto; definitely one of my favorites of the night and recommended.  Cooked to perfection the mixture of tuna, chilis, and tomatoes made this dish a spicy and sweet delight!  The pork belly was again cooked well, but didn't really do much for me.  We ended of course with dessert; Butterscotch Pot de Creme with Olive oil, Lemon, and Rosemary Shortbread and Chef Cullen's Bread Pudding.  The shortbread worked only with the cookie atop.  Without it just didn't give much texture and I mainly tasted only the Butterscotch.  The Bread Pudding well, it was bread pudding in the end.  Not much for dessert in my book.  Overall, the service spot on and top notch.  The place itself is classic and reminded me of some old southern style home.  Great ambiance and date place!  In the end, Crudo deserves my love and definitely a hot spot for me! - Enjoy!

My fellow AA members (affordable alcohol), you need not worry about your massive hangover!  For it has become a burger, yes The Hangover is not just a movie & a state of "man I'm never gonna drink like that anymore" feeling; you know who you are Mr. Patron! Now a Hangover is also a burger served at the Rehab Burger Therapy!  When I first walked into this bar I thought of Bar Rescue on Spike -- where's Jon Taffer!?  The place had some pretty cool decor and design; surfboards, guitars, and an aquatic background.    Anyways, I sat at the bar where I was greeted with a smile.  Great service here I must add!  Read the menu up and down and decided to go with the Hangover.  Boys, I saw her first!  It was DE-licous with a capitol D!  For Damn!!! That was good!  Medium done with bacon, fried egg, colby cheese, and green chilies - Yum!  I went with the Relapse, which was a smaller version of the regular sized burger.  HH everyday till 6pm so if you can make it I definitely would stop by.    The place has the rock n roll, surfer, tiki ambience.  Reminded my friend of Hawaii she claims.  I've never been to HI, but personal I'm content with being at the Rehab for now with a few drinks and enjoying a Hangover - yes I said enjoy the Hangover. - Enjoy!

Beep Beep!  Who's got the keys to my jeep?  Vroooom! (Missy "Misdemeanor " Elliott)  Food Truck Friday happens, well, every Friday in downtown Phoenix.  Located off Pierce and Central the the food truck phenomenum has arrived in Phoenix.  Thank you Great Food Truck Race on Food Network!  Actually Food Truck Friday was started by the Phoenix Street Food Coalition.  If you didn't know, Phoenix lags behind in the food truck scene like Los Angeles, New York, Portland, etc.  Who knew huh?  Yeah, like you didn't know!  The area where this event happens is not very big.  Seating is a B-I-T-C (shut your mouth!) I'm not even going to bring up the Shaft!  However, come early enough and maybe you'll get lucky.  Some people to do the "I'm saving these seats for a friend", thing, which really really is annoying!    Needless to say the scene is awesome!  Hot dogs, burgers, pizza, rice bowls, and cajun burritos!  I guarantee you'll come back for more and to explore the different flavors!  You definitely won't have all Friday to do so, but check out their daily weekly schedule - http://www.downtownphoenix.com/blog/tag/food-truck-fridays/ - Enjoy!

I really wanted to give this place more stars, but honestly is more important.   The place itself is well dressed.  Very modern Japanese style.  Felt like I was supposed to be ready to fight Lucy Liu in Kill Bill!  I guess what I'm trying to say is the place is beautiful and well laid out.    I can't say the same for the food.  It was lunch time and I wanted to try the Chicken Liver, but they discontinued it because not enough people ordered it.  Don't you people watch Andrew Zimmern!?  You call yourselves foodies!!!  Anyways, the next thing I asked was how was the Shrimp Flambé?  Waiter: "it's just shrimp, sautéed", well I appreciate the honesty, but wow that's not a good way to sell me anything even if you think it's awesome!  Pass!    I'll stick with the Bento Box lunch special -- I went with the "D", which came was sashimi, gyoza, BBQ ribs, spicy tuna rolls, and white rice.  Sashimi was my favorite cause well like the waiter expressed; it is what it is.  The gyoza was okay, but definitely right out of the freezer.  The BBQ ribs were way too salty and burnt!  The spicy tuna rolls (see sashimi).  I think they had decent white rice.  Overall, not a great experience, but I can appreciate them trying.  If anything I'll stop by for HH and order a couple of drinks, but I'll pass on the food for now. - Enjoy!

I really had high hopes for this place since Chef Johnny Chu's restaurants are generally no joke.  This place was rated by Phoenix Magazine as a top 10 Asian restaurants!  Well unfortunately, the jokes on me I guess.  I think the place is pretty hip and cool.  Ambience is classy with a club vibe.  However, on a regular day this place is displaced.  Located on Central off a strip mall and next to Lenny's Burger is an odd location it seems.  Once you walk in it's like a new world that you didn't expect looking from the outside.  I'm sure during the weekends this place can be popping.  I attended with a foodie friend this lovely Sunday evening hoping we would be impressed!  Great reviews from my fellow Yelpers!  We ordered the Crispy Fish Papaya Salad, Red Curry, and Crispy Fried Sole.  Our papaya salad too light on the spice and seasoning.  Needed more lemons and definitely more spice and fish sauce.  The fried sole, well was fried but overly glazed with the sweet and spicy sauce - seemed pretty generic to my taste; just add water taste.  Finally, the curry was okay.  Again the spice for it was sparse and I really didn't get a taste of traditional curry from it.    Needless to say, I'm disappointed!  Sorry gang I really wanted this place to work for me, but it didn't.  It's not to say I don't have respect for Chef Chu, but I'll have to pass on this place.  I don't know who came here from Phoenix Magazine to vote, but really; really!? - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Lady Gaga - Paparazzi)  I'm your biggest fan I'll follow you until you feed me Vovo-Vovomeena  Bo Bites, there's no other foodie-star You know that I'll be there Vovo-Vovomeena  Promise I'll be kind But I won't stop until I start to dine Vovo you'll be famous Yelp you down until you feed me Vovo-Vovomeena   Vovo Vroom-na!  This place has my heart!  Granted, very hipster-ish, but I can look past that.  I cam here with some friends on a Saturday.  The place was hip and popping with and urban funk.  With an open kitchen cooking up a storm and a barista counter for your coffee.  You need to order at in a line and pick your seating after.  I was looking at the menu; very traditional american breakfast, but with funky modern twist.  I went for the b.m.o.c, Waffles with a pork chop atop and apple maple syrup and finished with an over easy egg with a side of Portuguese donut.  It was sweet and savory at the same time while the oozy egg gave it a smooth texture to every bite.    Service overall was welcoming and quick.  I didn't get a chance to order and coffee, but definitely and next time for me and Bo Bites recommendation! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Mariah Carey & Miguel - Beautiful)  Hop on the front of the bar Let the good drinks flow in your mouth With a menu like that and so I smile so bright Oh, you're killing me, you know it ain't fair, yeah Ride on through the middle of the night Let the HH drinks kiss my lips When you cook like that, your service so right Oh, you're killing me, baby do it again  The Central Bistro, and my mind is on the Central Bistro And I can Yelp cause it means a thing to me, to me, yeah The Central Bistro, and my mind is on the Central Bistro And I can Yelp cause it means a thing to me, to me, yeah yeah  The Central Bistro is located offsite from the hectic Biltmore traffic which I can appreciate.  I love coming here I guess that's what I'm trying to say.  Never too crowded and the food is awesome.    I always come for HH or as they like to call it "Social Hour", great drink and food specials and they even do reverse HH or reverse "Social Hour"; whatever!  Never the less, it's sweet!  I love the proscuitto melon pizza here!  Not too cheesy and just the right amount of blend or salty cured meat while the melon mellos it out!  At half price during "Social Hour" -- POW! Give me 2!  Drink specials are generally $1 off beers and assortment of small bites.  Perfect for any budget you're coming with.  Again, if you miss our early for Social Hour.  No worries, Central Bistro opens late for reverse Social Hour!  Yah for Social Hour! -- Enjoy!

Street tacos right on the Strip of Las Vegas!  It's not as dingy and dink as most places I'm used to, but being on a prime location I think they do pretty well up keeping the place.  I ordered the El Pastor, Carnitas, Carne Asada, and Lengua -- Ci yo soy mucho hambriento!  How you gusto me Spanish!?  They didn't put any sauce a top, which for me was odd since the hot sauce is that extra kick that does it for me.  I had to ask for some on the side which was not a problem.  Overall, the lengua was blah, the carnitas was good, but my favorites were the Carne Asada and El Pastor.  Guess they had those ready and popping since I gather these are the popular choices.  The sauce which gave it some kick along with the lemon and onions really helped keep the meat moist.  Wrapped with a soft corn tortilla this street taco was yummy and very rare can you find a place that makes it this good!    Definitely a recommended taco joint if you're strolling the streets of Vegas and need a quick bite to give you that energy boost! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Kelis - Milkshake)  Fox Concept brings all of us to The Yard, And they're like It's tastier than before, Damn right it's tastier than before, You can dine here,  But they have to charge  Fox Concept brings all of us to The Yard, And they're like It's tastier than before, Damn right it's tastier than before, You can dine here,  But they have to charge  I know you want it,  The thing that makes you hungry,  What all of us go crazy for. They lose their minds,  The way we dine, I think its time  La la-la la la, Warm it up. Lala-lalala, We're all waiting  The Yard is an interesting place.  Two different dining experiences; one from what I gather a seafood/oyster restaurant and the other is the Culinary Dropout.  Culinary Dropout I would describe is modern American cuisine.  Great small bites to share so we ordered the pretzel with cheese, bacon with grilled cheese and the mussels.    The pretzels were soft and doughy while the creamy cheese helped with the chewing process, if you know what I mean.  The bacon and grilled cheese sandwich really worked well together.  That's gonna be my new thing grilled cheese and bacon; why didn't I think of this!  Finally, the mussels with the broth, which I still can't figure what it is...yummy!  Overall my favorite of the night and definitely a recommendation.    Drinks are pretty pricey, and the games around "the yard" are pretty cool.  Ping pong tables, foosball, and corn hole games spread across the place.  It reminds me of an East coast roof top bar feel with the couches and the live band rocking away.  It can get real loud here, but if you can't handle the noise keep your butt at home and enjoy a glass of wine.  In the end, this is the closet thing to a night life in Central area of Phoenix. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Billy Joel - We Didn't Start The Fire)  Laura Carstens, Crossfit Kids, Chris Stasiks, Helen WOD's Divelbiss - Skip & Tiff, Chris Kern, Erin Wellendorf Tom Casella, Filthy Fifties, Damian Walker, partner up! Endurance Clubs, Lifting Clubs, Tony Lamanna  Massage room, Matt Buse, kettlebells, Tabata Burpees, the rope and I and the snatcher with the kips Sumo Deadlift, front squats, Bo Bites got a new team Double unders, Shoulder press, Burpee Bar Muscle Ups  We didn't start Crossfire It was always burning Since crossfits been turning We didn't start Crossfire Oh we always WOD it And we try to PR it   I've been attending Wildfire Crossfit for quite some times now.  Needless to say, this is the longest I've ever attended a Crossfit gym!   I've always wanted to do Crossfit, but wasn't really sure which one until a friend recommended Wildfire; whom is also a trainer here (Laura).  I took her up for it and went in first thing the following week.  Ever since that day, I have not missed a week which goes to say; Wildfire Crossfit is a very inviting gym.  From the prospective of an outsider, there was nothing "douchey" about this place neither were there hardcore crossfitters screaming in your face to force you to do things you can't (Youtube - Your Crossfit Friends (Hardly Working).    The trainers here are very knowledgeable and motivating.  We focus on a lot on the basic movements and form to make sure we don't injure ourselves.  After a week my shoulders were so sore to a point where I couldn't do any shoulder workouts, but Skip, one of the trainers showed me how to properly stretch and also modified my workout for the week to help me recover.  Much appreciated to know they were able to accommodate what you can and can't do.  I run marathons and they are fully aware of it so when the time comes I generally taper off my workouts.    Aside from the friendly trainers, attendees at this gym comes from all walks of life; working professionals, college students, mothers, fathers, young and old.  There seems to be a diverse crowd and they all pitch-in to cheer you on to finish your WOD (Workout of the Day).  My most despised days are WOD's named with female names (i.e. Helen, Sally, etc....) cause you'll get to know them and it'll kick you booty good and right.....right to the ground!

I had a lot of fun at Tough Mudder - Yes it was tough!  I would definitely recommend this as part of a team building experience since there are some obstacles that you would need some help with.    I anticipated Tough Mudder to be much more "tougher" since the video portrays a lot masculinity and whoo-ras (This is Sparta!) hollers.  However, it was just real fun with some regulated pain.  I think I over strength trained for  this and if you're asking; there's some upper body strength needed, but if you can do pull-ups you're good.  I would say it's all an endurance game.  Make sure you can run at least 5-8 miles cause there are resting periods when the obstacles start to bottleneck so a full 12 miles is not ideal.    Be ready to get bruised, scraped, cut,  and feel the sensation of being drowned!  I think what I hated most is the small rocks and sentiments inside my shoes while running.  It was just grinding inside -- Blah!  The shock treatments suck...!  There's no other way to describe it or prepare for it.  It knocked me out for few seconds and when I awoke, my face was in the muddy waters and I ended up drinking some -- yuck! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Rihanna ft. Mikky Ekko - Stay)  All along it was just shavings A cold ice freezing believer I threw my hands in the air I said show me something He said, if you dare then add a little chocolate  Round and around and around and around I went Ohhh now tell ya now tell ya now tell ya now I know (what to order)  Not really sure how to feel about it Something in the way it taste Makes me feel like I can't live without it It takes me to a cooler place I want some more Snoh.......!  I was "snow" ice shavings were first brought to my attention when I traveled to LA.  Wasn't sure what the rave was about, but I gave it a try.  At the time I thought it was a pretty cool concept and didn't know why Phoenix didn't have it --- Cause we live in the damn desert!    Finally, "Snoh" ice was brought to us by this place -- Thank you Snoh Ice Shavery.  You didn't even come up with some weird name, just tell us what it is; ice shavings with consistency like snow haha!    The place itself has a LA tea boba shop feel.  A lot Asian kids hanging around and reading some Manga.  Man I'm getting too old for this place!    Overall, "snoh" shavings here are pretty good.  Your choice of toppings from gummy bears, tapioca, lychees, strawberries, and chocolate syrup.  Similar to your self-pour yogurt shops, but "snoh" is ice shavings so you amount of calories are much much much more lower than your average desert.  That's why I totally appreciate this awesome invention.  Not to say you should eat this for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner.  Everything in moderation is fine.  Our host was very gracious and also the marketer for this place.  Well done my friend, but I still think Ironman would crush Batman! Wink! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - James Blunt - You're Beautiful)  The food is excellent My mouth is full I saw a wine list Of that I'm sure  She smiled at me as I ordered She had many patrons at hand But they won't lose me as a customer  Cause I'm a big fan  Nosh Arizona, Nosh Arizona Nosh Arizona, it's cool I saw your place in a magazine space And I thought I'd go to you Cause I'll always be coming back to you  Nosh=to eat food enthusiastically or greedily.  Indeed, I'm guilty of this heinous deed!  However, I have to say I was damn hungry!  I came with a gal pal and we sat at the kitchen bar.  Nosh is definitely a cute setting and relaxing atmosphere.  Located in Chandler it's a rare find!    We ordered...well I should say I ordered the Apple Gorgonzola pizza to share or not!  Needless to say scarfed it down!  The sweetness of the cheeses meshed well with the saltiness of the maple bacon while the hint of bitterness came from the arugula.  Yummy yummy yummy indeed!  They have a nice wine list, but I'm a beer guy so had to get my favorite Magic Hat.  Overall, great dine and wine place and with some live music this place would pop! - Enjoy!

I usually don't write about chains unless I feel really strongly about it.  Let's start with the food:  It was Okay it didn't really blow me away by any means, but if you're itching for a steak this place will do just fine.  Here's where I can get nasty and I will try to be fair and cordial.  Service somewhat stinks.  They take reservations, but it's first come first serve.  I know they're not the only place guilty of such things, but get rid of it.  Just be honest and tell me you don't take reservations! (FU%$!)  Needless to say, we ended up waiting for about half an hour.  Sat down got our drinks and ordered.  Couple of our steaks were not done the right way....okay fair we had a large group.    Finally, our checks were wrong -- we got someone else's ticket and we try to explain it to the waitress (she snarks back "what's the problem!?")  Granted, I've been a waiter before and some nights just suck, but keep your cool.  Always smile and tell them you'll fix it.  Apparently, we were in her way of doing her job.  In the end, we were all surprised and shock and couple of us had to speak to the manager.    In the end, bad experience ruins the night and dinner.  Sorry LH Steakhouse you just didn't cut it this time!

Nothing too crazy here from what I see.  I gather it can however, get a tad bit wild during the weekends and especially around ASU.    Overall, food was okay at best.  The salsa that came with the chips had too much lime.  Tasted like lime juice and the chips were store bought.    I ordered the crunchy fish tacos.  Crunchy indeed it was, but again what's up with the lime.  I added a little bit on my tacos and again it was too much.  The guacamole sauce atop wasn't bad, but my tacos were overly seasoned already.  The crunchiness was there along with the cabbage mellowing it out; that was a nice welcome.  The rice and beans were out of a can as expected.  In the end, probably come for drinks but that's about it. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Celine Dion & R. Kelly - I'm Your Angel)  No sake too dry for you to try All you have to do is have an appetite, oh yeah No valley too far for you to make it across All you have to do is review it when you stay  And then you will see the noodles they serve And every dish will be tasty as they come Serve me some Pho cast them on me I just want you to eat  I'll have your eggrolls in a fly I'll have your Pad Thai just to try I'll try your Tartare when you make it At Angelina's    Angelina's is probably one of the best Americanize modern Vietnamese fusion restaurant I've experienced in the Phoenix valley!  I generally don't venture around on the Westside much so I had to Yelp around for a restaurant and found this little gem!  The decors are definitely Asian inspired and is a mix of all the major Asian cultures; Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean....etc.  A full bar with Sake, Sochu, and draft beer was apparent; totally dig the imports!  I sat at the bar stool since I was solo.  I had fun just reading the menu to see all fusion mix, but settled for the Beef Tartare and the Snow Crab Udon Noodle Soup.    The Chef came out to great me asking my nationality; as first I was confused, but later he explained that most Vietnamese guest that come in expect a certain type of Tartare, but his culinary education was French inspired so it was different.  I told him I don't have a preference and I only appreciate good food.  The Tartare was served like a raw hamburger patty with some Shrimp chips and some well-seasoned roasted mushrooms.  The capers atop provided a sour pungent bite as I spread the Tartare on top of the chips which of course gave it a crunchy texture to every piece I ate.  Overall, I enjoyed it very much!  The Snow Crab Udon noodle was next and this for me was another exploration dish.  The broth was extra thick like egg drop soup.  The beef was well infused in the broth giving it that extra flavorful taste while the udon noodles was slippery and slurpee making it a perfect noodle meal!  The chef came out with some house made hot sauce which added to make dish giving it a spicy punch!  I only added a little since I enjoy spicy, but not too much and boy was that sauce spicy!    Overall, service was great and food was tops.  The chef and staff provided me with extra attention maybe because I looked Vietnamese and I'm sure they were wondering what I would think.  I'm not picky nor would I ever complain about "hey this ain't like mom's cooking"!  Cause in the end, it isn't mom's cooking and it will never be, but expect to venture out of your comfort zone and be open minded! - Enjoy!

Came here after a night out with the boys.  I don't recall much but I did order a reuben sandwich.  Let's just say she would be disappointed if she saw it!  Yep the sandwich itself was massive and for sure I wasn't able to finish it....or was it!?  Needless to say, I ended up downing the whole thing while chatting away about the night.  The toast was crunchy from the outside and soft towards the middle, giving it a nice crunch while you sink your teeth into the warm cornbeef.  Add a little zing and sting from the sauce and we're all good.    The place itself was packing quick from the late-nighters.  Loud as it should be while some of the unlucky one continue to work their magic for one last hurrah at a one-nighter! - Enjoy!

Want some Salty Sow  Salty Sow is straight out of Austin, Texas and the Chef is offering up a James Beard menu so get your name on the list if you can!    I've been here for a Yelp event and came back once more for Happy Hour.  I ordered their pork belly tacos and stuffed mushrooms.  The stuffed mushrooms came first and I thought it was pretty tasty! A top with some pork sausage and parmesan cheese, this starter had some pop.  All 3 ingredients had its distinct taste and vied for position on my palate; no matter it's going to end in the same place haha!  The star of the night was the pork belly tacos -- Yummy!  Topped with an over-easy egg and arugula! Uh! Food-porn did this delicious bite no justice!  Needless to say you must come here to try it and understand what I'm talking about.  The saltiness of the bacon combined with the settle bitterness of the arugula mixed with the creaminess of the egg ---- oooooo! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Chuck Berry - Route 66)  Well if you ever plan to eat some steak Just take Bo Bites way that's the smart way that's the best Get your grub on Steak 44  Well they wine from 44th St. to Scottsdale More than 145 degrees all the way Get your grub on Steak 44  One of the better steak places in town in my books.    Formally a Mastros, Steak 44 brings it home with a punch to your palates.  Their operations is quite impressive and the care and craft they have in the back kitchen; as Mr. O gave us a tour, was on spot to explain why this is a hot new dining experience.    Our tabled ordered a bunch of stuff starting with some truffle fries, cream corn, meatballs, and creamed spinach.  We all ordered our own steak, but I went with the bone-in filet.  My steak in general was perfectly cooked, nice charred on the outside and medium cooked in the middle that still steamed with every cut!  The plate is super heated thus keeping the steak warm all through your dinner.  The sides that came along with our meal was phenomenal!  Can't go wrong with truffle fries that came in a glass fries container shaped like a McDonalds case!  The cream corn was how it was supposed to be -- creamy and sweet!  Another highlight of the night was the meatballs - crusty on the outside, while you dip it in marinara and taking a bite release an aromatic burst of the herbs used.    Service was spot on.  I gather coming to a place like this you would expect that and it was met.  The ambiance was classy perfect for date.  Definitely, laid out like a steak house and one visited for at least one experience! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Lorde - Royals)  I've love to eat my sushi extra fresh I sink my teeth in nigiris by the movies (AMC Theater) And I'm very proud of my reviews In the Desert Ridge, my postings to envy  But everybody's like Bo Bites Yelping Diamonds stars on your reviews Food Porn Reviews Readers on my lyrics  We all care, we caught up in your food affairs!  And let's all go to Nori (Sushi) Asian Kitchen for lunch That kind of thought is just for us, we crave a different kind of brunch And let's all go to Nori (Sushi) Asian Kitchen for some beef And Bo Bites we'll eat, we'll eat, we'll eat Let me taste that Sushi  I like this place.  Nestle nicely in the heart of Desert Ridge Marketplace, this little Asian eatery is a nice treat away from your chain restaurants littered all over this area!  My mentor and I ordered the; Shrimp Katsu Burger, Nigiri Select, and Galbi Short Ribs.  Yeah it was a lot of food and very inexpensive!  The Katsu Burger was unique, it was like a crab cake breaded in panko and layered with the Nori BBQ and honey mustard dressing.  I like the texture; crunchy and savory at the same time.  However, I would like to disregard the hamburger bun; maybe a lettuce wrap to make it lighter since it's already a heavy dish.  The Nigiri Select was a delight for only $10; I'm in!  Great tasting and great price.  I wasn't too impress with the Galbi Short Ribs since they were very fatty.  Maybe it's supposed to be that way, but I didn't care for it.   The place itself is very modern and organic looking.  Sleek, polished and appealing in my opinion  Overall, a nice experience and definitely a place I can come back to for drinks and hopefully more lunch time. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Of Monsters And Men - Mountain Sound)  I heard them brewing in the valley So I called my friends and fam Far away from all the commotion  I had caused with my two hands  Thirsty we traveled armed with nothing but a hunger We came, from far away  Hold your craft brews now (Sleep until the valley of the sun goes down) Through the peaks we ran (Deep into the North Mountain Brew) Hold your craft brews now (Sleep until the valley of the sun goes down) Through the peaks we ran   North Mountain Brewing is off the map in my books.  I wouldn't have guessed it exist simply because I don't travel to that part of Phoenix often. However, I'm glad I had the opportunity to visit this locally own brewery!  North Mountain focuses on what they call Beercentric foods; or foods that are inspired by beers.    I came on a Sunday afternoon brunch with a gang of a 7 and went for the beer flights right away.  I'm not much of a beer drinker anymore, but I can say the beers I ordered were definitely tasty and each had it's own character; some sweet, some floral, and some strong like whiskey!  Overall, I really enjoyed their beers.  However, I'm a food guy so let's get started!    I wasn't too hungry the day I attended, but they seemed to have some mouthwatering dishes; Poutine breakfast, Chicken & Waffles, and Skillet Scrambles.  Today I ordered the North Mountain Scramble with over-easy egg.  Overall, the sausage and bacon beneath was cooked to perfection with the oozing of the egg; gave this dish welcoming brunch bite with every sip of beer!  What I also appreciate about the dish I ordered was the size; it wasn't overly huge to the point where I had to take some home.  All the other dishes seemed pretty big, but I guess I picked it right this time around! - Enjoy!

Hakkasan is an amazing nightclub!  It's new and modern with several floors to cater to your type of music.  I would consider this one of the best nightclubs I've attended in years.  Then again I don't go out clubbing as much as I used to.  However, I'm sure this is definitely one of the more well laid out clubs.    Overall, there was definitely enough space for the large crowd.  My favorite - is the bar staff; well done.  Drinks were popping out left and right, before I finish and BAM, another one in my hands already.   When it flows that fast people generally drink more, funny thing as I know I spent some $$, but where'd all my drinks go.    Needless to say, the atmosphere and the music gets you going and I just kept on buying drinks for me and everyone else!  Damn you Hakkasan developers!  Got me again this time! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Plain White T's - Hey There Delilah)  Hey there, Sushi Style What's up with your Sashimi? I'm a couple miles away But boy, tonight I feel so hungry Yes I do  No Sushi joint can shine as bright as you I swear it's true  Hey there, Sushi Style Don't you worry about the distance I'm right there if you get new ingredients Give this song another listen Close your eyes Listen to my voice, it's my review I'm Bo Bites Hi!  Oh it's what you do to me Oh it's what you do to me Oh it's what you do to me Oh it's what you do to me What you do to me   Sushi in Style!  I can appreciate anything in style!  I'm no sushi connoisseur, but when it comes to good eats I'm your man!  I came here on a whim one day for lunch.  Apparently it was the wrong day according to one of the sushi masters Kevin.  Fresh and new ingredients on Thursday & Friday.    Needless to say, I trudged on to order starting with the Opaleye nigiri since they were out of Geoduck....my favorite.  Then with some Tuna Tartar, raw Octopus with wasabi sauce, and bacon wrapped scallops.  The Opaleye nigiri was pretty good, but I still had my mind on Geoduck (get past it already....right!).  My favorite of the day is probably the Tuna Tartar and raw Octopus.  The tuna was meshed with some caviar and rested on a fried wonton shell while drizzled with what appears to be a mayo/wasabi aioli (I could be wrong about the sauce).  Once you get past that it is raw, the Octopus has the consistency of a pickle with a jerky-like chewiness.  The wasabi sauce gave it a slight kick while the welcoming sesame oil really brought out an aromatic punch and taste.  I didn't really care for the bacon wrapped scallop since it didn't mix well with what I ordered I guess.    Overall, a solid sushi place and totally nice spot for a happy hour gathering.  Good prices and the layout seemed like it could carry and good after hour vibe with a nice outdoor patio.  Kevin and James, the two sushi masters were welcoming and informed me well about the ingredients.  Service was somewhat slow unless you sit at the bar. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Michael Jackson - Beat It) They told me I should come around here You want to stuff your face of food you best appear The fire's in their kitchen and I their steak is really rare So eat it, just eat it  You better eat, you better do what you can Don't want no bread, because you're a nacho man You wanna be full, better do what you can So eat it, and you just want to be full!  Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it Everyone to Barrelhouse and feed it Showin' how hungry strong is your bite It doesn't matter what you order because it's good and right Just eat it, eat it Just eat it, eat it Just eat it, eat it Just eat it, eat it  Barrelhouse is located in the strip mall Northwest corner of the cross streets.  I say this cause I feel it's such an off beat area to have a place like this there.  Needless to say, Barrelhouse is an artwork inside.  The Decors and design is put together by local Asian inspired artist Mr. Gary Hostallero (www.hostallero.com).  Gary gives Barrelhouse a warm modern feel with a romantic setting.  Just pass me my wine and let me lounge on the couch and I'm dandy!  Tonight, I ordered their Light and Stormy signature cocktail and the Lingonberry Glazed Pork Tenderloin.  F'in Phenomenal!  Gotta keep it PG-13 for the kids, but damn this tenderloin was done just right.  Little bit on the pink side and the tart BBQ glazed was not overly poured on.  Some places just douse it, but nope it was well proportioned at Barrelhouse.  Sweetness and just the right about of bitterness with the greens, while my cocktail was a perfect balance of sweet & sour.  Can I say more besides get your but in here!  Service is top notch and the knowledge of their drinks is amazing.  My first magic hat beer here and I'm in love with it.  I have a love/hate personality and most of the time it's LOVE! haha!  Overall, Barrelhouse is worth the trip and $$ cause you definitely have to try if you're ever on the East side of town! - Enjoy!

I hate to do this but man I cannot recommend this place.  Service and the staff were friendly and on top of things.  Food however was horrid.  It felt like the seasoning tasted like it was out of a package and just add water and ingredients!  I ordered the Thai Basil Chicken, while my friends ordered the Pan Fried Noodles with Seafood and Pad Thai.  The Pad Thai my friend had was colorless and bland; it tasted like they used old oil to fry it too.  My Thai Basil Chicken was what I consider sustenance....I've had better camp food from a bag from Walmart.  Again bland, colorless, and just straight up not good...!  My other friends Pan Friend noodles were decent, crispy noodles atop with vegetables and a seafood medley.  Again the lack of sauce and seasoning that should be doused on this dish should soften the noodles.  I always try to think of a ways that would help instead of just complaining.  Hire a new chef is one.  Basic Chinese food is not that hard to make in reality.  The lack of seasoning really plays a big part to the chef; I've been the the food industry long enough and still is to know this truth.  If it's an off night; then it was way off!

(Lyrics - Train - Hey, Soul Sister)  Heeeyy, Heeeyy, Heeeyy!  Your wine bar sings on the patio of my Sunday brunch I knew I wouldn't forget you And so I went and let you blow my mind  Your sweet pancakes The smell of your food in every single bite I bite I knew when we tried it you're the one I have decided Who's one of the kind  Hey Salut Kitchen, ain't that Bo Bites Bo Bites on the patio, reviewing The way you cook ain't fair you know Hey Salut Kitchen, I don't wanna miss a single thing you serve.....tonight!  Heeeyy, Heeeyy, Heeeyy!   We came to Salut for brunch after a long run.  Needless to say, we needed some food bad!  The place itself was quite spacious and open with a large patio for outdoor seating and a full bar.  There was a one man band this lovely Sunday we attended.  Couple of us ordered the Bacon Bloody Mary while I stuck with the basic beer.  For food we went for the Chicken and Waffles, Quinoa Pancakes, and the Benedict Florentine.  I didn't have the chance to try the Florentine, but the Chicken and Waffles were delicious.  Extra crispy chicken breast atop a hearty belgium waffle with a side of cinnamon butter and honey maple syrup; so wrong, but so right at the time!  The Quinoa pancakes was made with cinnamon and honey giving it a spicy and sweet bite and topped with thick whip cream and strawberries.  Perfect start to my Sunday eating experience.  Foodies and runners alike should enjoy this spot as a must go!  Service was on top of things and the ambiance was semi-wine and semi-sports bar in my opinion.  They had a large screen projector showing the playoff game so that was nice. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - B.O.B ft. Bruno Mars - Nothing On You)  Squid Ink Sushi, in downtown Phoenix I could be tasting, and my time is precious They got nothin on you, baby Nothin on you, baby  They might say Bo, and I might say Bites But you shouldn't worry, about what I'm saying Cause they got nothin on you, baby Nothin on you, baby  Literally the center of downtown Phoenix lies a sushi restaurant.  Yep, a sushi restaurant in the middle of a desert!  Hot as it may be; maybe it's heating up because of this place - wink!  Let us explore and enjoy!  My friend from Philly was in town and Bo Biting we went!  Ordered our drinks and went for the kill!  We started with some Agedashi Tofu; it was breaded with Panko and layed on a bed of smoky mirin soy sauce; overall a good start.  Next we went for it; spicy salmon roll, salmon roe, Pokemon roll, Flying Phoenix roll, and the Pan Seared Butterfish to top it off!  I didn't try the salmon roe since I usually don't care for it.  The first thing I notice and so did my partner was the rice was pretty darn good and well cooked. My favorite of the bunch was definitely the Pokemon roll; what seems to be a California roll topped with jalapeno, grilled onion and a grapefruit.  Second in line was the Flying Phoenix; crab roll topped with seared ahi, shrimp, and black pepper sauce drizzled all around.  We finished our entree with the butterfish which was beautifully plated.  It was served with grilled asparagus and fried onions and a very unique sauce; strawberry miso!  We finished the night was dessert of course and we went for the rice pudding brulee - OMG!  What a dessert; sticky rice, coconut milk, vanilla bean within a brown crusted sugar!  Where have you been in my short life!    Overall, a great experience!  Service was attentive and well trained while the place was very modern and sleek.  In the end, I must recommend a try! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Aerosmith - I Don't Want To Miss A Thing)  I could stay to dine just to taste you pastries Watch me smile while I am eating While you're cooking and serving I could spend my day in this sweet surrender I could stay lost in this moment forever Cause every dish I try at this place is a moment I treasure  Phoenix Public Market Cafe I do wanna Yelp today Cause I want to Bo Bites And I don't wanna miss a thing  Cause even when I write of you The sweetest words will never do I'd still want to Bo Bites Cause I don't wanna miss a thing  Phoenix Public Market Cafe doesn't look like much from the outside.  However, once you walk in the place is definitely different from your usual restaurant experience.  Order at the counter like any cafeteria/cafe and bring your number to a public table or if you choose sit at the bar.    I went for the bar this time around.  Service was somewhat slow, but I wasn't in a rush that day.  I ordered a water since it was only a lunch break and went for the AZ burger.  Overall, the burger is pretty darn good in my books.  I didn't really care for one thing; the bun.  It was pretty dry and bulky, but the burger itself was cooked to perfection.  I had it medium and it was topped with Green Chili, Lettuce, Cheddar, and House Sauce.  I'm not sure what the House Sauce was, but all in all the ingredients worked and was mesh of sloppiness that reminded me of a Sloppy Joe.  Anything that brings back memories is a plus to my palates.    The place itself was a farm art shop.  Very cute boutique-like stuff and a bakery that pumps out some desserts and baked goods.  The staff seemed friendly as if they were working at a Whole Foods.  Overall, a great atmosphere to chill and ain't nothing like supporting your local farms and restaurant! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Usher ft. Monica - Slow Jam)  I was all alone I was feeling for some Pho I needed something to cure my hunger up So I dropped in on for lunch Just to take a chance And there this lovely place Pho was just for 10 bucks!  I asked her for eggrolls She said would I like a coke So pleased that I had asked She quickly served my meal And I ate and fell in love Only at  Pho Viet Ohhh  Serve me a bowl of Pho This time make it sweet Only at Pho Viet  I like this place!  I love the combo here!  Yeah combo Pho meals here for lunch.  Pho Viet is definitely a small mom & pop ran restaurant.  I came on a whim to try and needless to say I wasn't disappointed.  I went for the Combo which came with a bowl of Pho, eggroll, and a soda.  The eggroll tasted homemade and with a perfect crunch along with mint leaves and a lettuce wrap; making this appetizer delightful.  The Pho itself was darn good and just what you'd expect.  Some people would complain about the portion size of the combo, but serious you probably need to eat less anyways....seriously!    The place overall was spacious and well decorated with a couple of HDTV screens.  Service was overall attentive and on the ball about everything so all in all a great experience! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - AWOLNATION - Sail)  Snooze  This is how I show my love I sang it in Bo Bites because Blame it on my bright Bowtie baby  This is how a pancakes made Yelp it on my own reviews Blame it on my bright Bowtie baby  Snooze, Snooze Snooze, Snooze, Snooze  Hit the Snooze one more time!  Oh wait, welcome to Snooze AM Eatery and highly popular breakfast/brunch joint that I first heard about out in the SD area.  When I attended I had to wait for 30 mins with my gang.  No worries I expected to wait since it only opens during the day.  When we finally sat we all decided to share the pancake trio - Pancake of the Day (Blueberry syrup with powdered sugar), Strawberry-Rhubarb, and the BanaNutella.  Of course we all each order an entree.  I went with Snooze Spud Deluxe - a plate of hash browns mixed with bacon and chorizo and topped with an overeasy egg!  Overall, this dish was a crunchy, mix of breakfast meat and egg with it's oozy yolk which helped mellow out the bite -- Yummy!   The pancakes were okay I thought.  I'm not much of a dessert pancake guy; the strawberry one was soggy since it was drenched in the strawberry-rhubarb sauce.  My favorite was the BanaNutella pancake - crunch of the hazelnuts and soft at the same time with a savory nutella!  We ordered the OMG French Toast just to top it off -- OMG was it good!    Overall, great service and the ambiance was vibrant and full of life.  A great way to start off the morning with good old fashion yet modern breakfast! - Enjoy!

However their baked shop is awesome!  Sweets sweets and more sweets!  I couldn't eat them all cause they were "man-sized" portions!  I was expecting samples, but nope grown-up sized!  I sound like wimp saying this, but wowza; may I have a petite portion please?  Gotta watch my girlish figure!  However, thanks LGO and Chef Turner for showering us with such delicious delight.    DJ Sterling spinning again and a Yelp proposal!?  Zoinks!  Cough, cough, cough, almost swallowed my cupcakes!  That was awesome and I hope the best for the couple -- congratulations!    Overall, the line was worth waiting for.  Though it was hot in the kitchen, but you know what they say --- if you can't handle the heat......get a Yelp fan! - Enjoy!

I have what they call "Asian Boy Hair" - fine, light, and thin.  Or was that how I like my girls....!?   Maybe it's both!  Anyways I met Cindy through the Ms. Chinese Pageant.  No I wasn't in the pageant, she was!  Just to let you know and there were fine, light, and thin gals there - Wink!  Needless to say, Cindy's service is number one!  She does is all; hair, makeup and the whole Shebang!  Got a wedding!?  Well I don't, but I'm pretty sure you do.  Cindy also does large events and gatherings.  So in case you need someone reliable, professional, and proud of her work and business; CW is the one to count on!    I've been here for years and will keep coming back.  Us guys have a small hair fetish and we want consistency and someone that understands our style.  CW understands me, aside that we both speak Cantonese!  She is fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese so no need for a translator for you Chinese speaking peeps.  Cindy is located in the strip mall at a store front called Salon Karizma.  Perfect title for a CW, since someone has to make this Asian Boy look good with confidence and charisma! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Jamiroquai - Virtual Insanity)  It's a wonder man can eat at all When things are big That should be small Who can tell what cocktail spirits, they'll be doing for us  And I'm giving all my love to this restaurant Only to be told I can see, I can eat Bo Bites will we be  And nothing's gonna change they way I Yelp Cause I can always take and never give And now that things are serving for the best, see, Whoa! It's a new craft we're dining in And I just can see that half of us immersed in drinks Is all we have to give these stars  Foodies made of Virtu Honest Craftery now always seem to, be governed by this love I have For eating, drinking, of new ingredients Oh now there is no bounds for we all love restaurants   Virtu is was voted best new restaurant by Esquire earlier this year and one thing we know these days is we can trust the news!  Ummmm well, let's not jump the gun just yet and decide for ourselves.    I came here with a friend for restaurant week.  I ordered a drink and requested the bartender make it spicy since that's my new thing and he was happy to oblige.  Needless to say, I'm always appreciative of good service!  We began with appetizers; the Burrata and Polenta Board.  I took a bite of the Polenta Board my mate ordered and boy was it creamy and cheesy at the same time.  The braised pork atop gave it some extra sweet texture.  My Burrata was the similar I would say; creamy mozzarella ball cheese warm to the cut with prosciutto aside while what seems to be a balsamic reduction drizzled over it.  Overall an excellent start!  For our entree my mate ordered the Flat Iron Steak while I shot for the Seared Orata.  I'm not a big fan of steak in general, but this one in particular was well cooked and seasoned.  My star of the night was my Orata; the skin was crispy to every bite and the fish was still moist and tender.  The dates provided a hint of sourness and the pesto help with subtle sweetness.    In the end, Virtu definitely delivered to what they sell.  Being best new restaurant is a strong title and their food showed it.  Service was stellar and a must return for this chap! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Celine Dion & Peabo Bryson - Beauty & The Beast)  Beer in Old Scottsdale Brew as it can be Barely even friends (oh boy) Then somebody Yelps Unexpectedly  Just a little cheese Cold, to say the least Bo a little Bites A review to prepare Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers  Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers you can't get anymore blunt than that!  I came on a late Saturday bar hopping night.  Yeah I'll admit I was a tad bit tipsy, but I made my way there.  As I looked at the menu I couldn't help but noticed they served a Juicy Lucy!  Thanks Food Network, now I'm hooked so I went for it!  Overall, not a bad attempt at all.  The burger was crisp-charred on the outside and a perfect crunch to a soft and cheesy middle.  The condiments seem freshly sliced and the fries were good.  They actually tasted amazing, but I gather by that time the alcohol in me was kicking in and needed something carby!    The atmosphere at the time was winding down, but I gather this place can get kicking.  Located right on the strip of Oldtown Scottsdale, I'm sure this place gets many hits a night.  Plus, they have a great select of draft beers and a lot TVs to get your sporting event on.  In the end, this place rocks - Enjoy!

I don't want to think about it! Bring me my wine!  PP is a great way for HH, social gathering, or "team building" event.  The point is simple; bring a friend, bring a drink, bring some munchies -- PAINT!    PP brings that inner Bob Ross out of you with great atmosphere and fun!  In the end, I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

It's at Hopdoddy, at Hopdoddy  You should read my reviews, to know what I have in mind Craft Brews you oughta know Now you taste so fine, let me order it on the line I wanna go where the milkshakes and the liquors flow  Hopdoddy Burger Bar is also part of the Salty Sow own restaurant cause that's how I got my guitar pick coupon and knew about this place!  They make their own patty and buns here! Dang.......!   I came with a friend and like most diners, you order in line and get a table number.  My friend order the Tuna Ahi Burger while I went with the Primetime, even though my heart was shooting for the Buffalo Bill - I love Bison!  Needless to say my Akaushi Beef burger was an experiment and it was okay for my palate.  I didn't really care for caramelized onions cause it really overpowered my truffle and brie cheese.  I had a hint of arugula and steak sauce.  I was really jealous of my friends Ahi Burger!  One of the best I've tasted with sweet honey wasabi and crunchy sprouts and nori chips....yummy!    Overall, food was awesome-good and the ambiance was perfect for a place to hangout for drinks.  They have many hand crafted specialty drinks plus only locally craft brew beers.  The service is on top of their game here.  Really well informed about their products and treated us with royalty.  That's an A+ in my books! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Kings Of Leon - Arizona)  That taste All I ever needed All I ever wanted Too full to keep eating  She serves Like the Farmhouse Saisons Checking it out With PB & J Burger  The ales Sophomoric IPA I must be feeling awkward Brewing Arizona  I go Write up for a Yelper Say that I am happy Too drunk to remember Wilderness.......   I love this place.  The craft brews here are strange, but once you taste it; it makes sense.  The also have an interesting burger that I heard much about that I had to get.  The PB & J with jalapeno burger!    For my beer I shot for the Sophomoric IPA, definitely not my cup of tea since it was a tad bit too sour for my taste.  Then again it was made with Mexican Lime which I should have known. However, next time I'm around I'm shooting for their flights; can't wait to taste them all!  Again for my entree I went for the PB & J burger.  Sounds totally awesome since I love peanut butter.  In the end, the burger was perfectly cooked and the ingredients worked.  Who'd thought a creamy peanut butter with a kick of spice went together!?  The fresh cut fries was good too, but what really surprised my group was the ketchup with siracha and mayo sauce that came with the onion rings.    In the end, AZ Wilderness Brewing Co. definitely is a new spot I would totally recommend!  It's  quite a popular spot in Mesa so prepare yourself to wait for seating, but once in; go for what sounds interesting to you! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Blues Traveler - Hook)  It doesn't matter what I Yelp So long as I sing with Bo Bites At The Vig Fillmore I'll review Some inner truth or vast reflection  But I've gave them 4 stars And I can keep it up for as long as it takes And it don't matter what I try If I'm doing my job then it's my reviews that make's it  Because the Vig brings you back I ain't tellin' you no lie The Vig brings you back On that you can rely  The Vig has done it again.  This time at "the Fillmore"    Located in the heart of Phoenix downtown, the Fillmore is perfect a for Sunday brunch or after a long work day Happy Hour.  I myself prefer being Happy during my Hours - Wink!    I came after a long work day with a friend and sat at what I call the backyard bar.  Nice breezy wind blowing through the bar area which sits in the middle so traffic flows well.  While the sunset upon the valley makes this place somewhat romantic!  HH specials on food and drinks; you can't pass this up!  I ordered their Grilled Fish Tacos along with a Stella Artois (Ever since that Adrian Brody Super Bowl commercial I've been drinking this like water -- darn you Super Bowl ads!)  Anyways, my fish tacos were amazingly tasty! Blackened whitefish with some pico de gallo and   spicy slaw gave this dish some kick and nice crunchy texture!  With a perfect setting and friends along with food and drinks; the Fillmore definitely got me hooked!    Overall, service was best at the bar area and ambiance makes any person feel lazy, and there's nothing wrong with that - wink! - Enjoy!

Neighborhood Hawaiian grill and Asian fusion; something we needed on the north side of Phoenix.   I came here after checking out Yelp and wanted to try something different.  This is definitely your mom/pop restaurant located in the heart of an industrial area.  I gather lunch time is when it's time to hit up this spot.  The decor are very basic and to the point; matter fact I would say lack of decors!  My first time around I shot for the Kalbi beef with rice from a recommendation by the register boy.  Overall, I didn't really care for it.  The beef was half tender and half chewy.  The sauce and coleslaw that came along with it was a nice compliment.    The second time I came around I shot for something I wanted; the Ninja Bowl with Bacon!  I thought it was a pretty solid Ninja Bowl; nice fluffy soft white rice at the bottom topped with strips of chicken and a sweet sauce.  The bacon was nice and crunchy giving this dish an array of texture.  However, I was somewhat lost because the salty sweetness of the bacon didn't really add much flavor in my opinion.  Maybe fire roasted chopped peanuts could have done the same, but without the confusing taste. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Weezer - Buddy Holly)  What's with this pizza tasting so good? They don't gotta front What did we ever do to deserve this That made them so delicious?  Hoo, hoo But you know I'm yours Hoo, hoo And I know you're mine Hoo, hoo And that's for all of time  Oh Bo Bites, Let's go to Pizza People Pub... Oh, oh, and order meatballs I want more! I Bo Bites what I want to say about it anyway I Bo Bites about that!  Great service great people great food!  Overall Pizza People Pub made my night much better!  I came on an off night so it was pretty chill spot.  The place is built right under some condos; lucky bastards!  With a U shape bar and TV screens all around this makes for a great sporting event place.  As I ordered my drink the bartender introduced me to a new whiskey since that was my choice of beverage tonight.  He offered me a sample; which was awesome, but I thought it was too smooth for my concoction.  Maybe next time.  My friend and I proceeded to order the pizza and meatball appetizer.  The meatball was layered with some marinara and topped with some garnishments.  Overall, very homemade tasting and darn great start to my palates.  The star of the night came when we went with The Hottie; a thin crust pizza with mozzarella, Italian sausage, jalapenos, serrano peppers, green chile, and basils;  when they say hot oh boy they meant hot!  Not a lot of places I know will put some banging hotness to my liking, but PPP popped me with a good Right!    In the end, definite spot for me to return if I'm back in the central area again! - Enjoy!

Let's review on Yelp Let's give it stars  How can we dance when I should be Yelping How do we sleep while I'm busy posting How can we Yelp when our drinks are flowing Seems like the way is to go Bo Biting -- wink!   Never really thought we would ever go to a chain to do an Elite Event, but hey it works.  Got my yummy nachos and my favorite of the night; breaded shrooms.  Needless to say, guess who had to finish it off at my table!  Didn't really care for the flatbreads, but the coconut shrimp and blooming onions help topped off the food binge night!    Drinks were awesome, I would definitely come back for the margarita mixes and the sangria wasn't that bad either.    Thanks again Lindsey and welcome aboard Jessica!

(Lyrics - The Notorious B.I.G - Hypnotize)  Burgers Burgers Burgers can I taste Sometimes your beers just hypnotize me And I just love your mobster ways Guess I'll go Capone, and try and milkshake  Burgers Burgers Burgers can I taste Sometimes your beers just hypnotize me And I just love your mobster ways Guess I'll go Capone, and try and milkshake  Came here with several Yelpers after a gather at the Cuttlefish next door.  Needless to say, same owner different restaurant!    Thought I was just gonna hit up for some drinks, but I couldn't resist a good looking burger!  The place was packed full of us Yelpers so service was a tad bit overwhelmed!  After a few shots and a craft brew, we ordered the Capone Burger and a milkshake (yes at the bar!)  In the end, the burger was phenomenal and the ingredients worked well; habanero jack cheese, pan fried egg, avocado, siracha, and crispy onions - Yummy!  I'm a texture guy and this burger really gave my palates a fun time!  Spicy and crunchy at the same time plus the over-easy egg and avocado gave it a creamy warm savory bite! The milkshake was interesting order since I didn't think it really mesh well with the theme of the restaurant, but also my burger.  However, it was good.  Service again was in a way slow, but then again the place was packing!  So I can understand.  In the end, I would definitely recommend you to stop by and enjoy a great tasting burger with a few drinks! - Enjoy!

Bei is a cute little Asian fusion spot on the border of Scottsdale and Tempe.  They serve up everything from sushi, Korean bulgogi, ramen, and other noodle plates.  I came here on a Friday night and the place was popping.  We had to wait couple of minutes for my seat with some of my mates which is fine.  The place itself is decked out pretty hip and fun.    We ordered some food off the happy hour to start; edamame, Spicy Tuna, Volcano, and California.  Needless to say it wasn't anything special to start with.  Then again it was just starters, but in the end we didn't think it was something we couldn't get anywhere else.  We moved on with some entrees.  My mate ordered the Sashimi platter while I shot for the Goshujang Pork; a spicy marinated pork dish with white rice as a side.  It did come along with some tempura vegetables and a miso soup.  In the end, it was a lot of bang for your bucks I tell ya!  The entree definitely needed some texture since it was a mesh of tender pork, onions, and some scallions on a sizzling hot plate as a came straight out of the kitchen!  Overall, the food here is pretty good, but again nothing too special.  The place seems pretty cool for a quick happy hour bite and drink.  The service was pretty slow in my opinion since we had to wait for our edamame twice! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Toni Braxton - Breathe Again)  If I never taste your Shrimp Spring Rolls again If I never taste your tender beef again If I never smell your broth and sauce now and then Will I never Yelp and review you once again  Please understand if Bo Bites rants Then I promise you, I promise you That, that I come by Pho Viet Nam again  Pho Viet Nam Pho Viet Nam That I shall come by Pho Viet Nam again Pho Viet Nam   Pho Viet Nam is a pretty solid Pho joint in the heart of the Chandler suburbs.  Pho Viet Nam is definitely your old school mom/pop owned Pho restaurant.  The place itself was quite typical of such a place.  Bad portrait paintings, poor replicas of traditional artwork and a couple of tv screens on the wall; you know the cheap Chinatown stuff you put up to signify you're an Asian establishment.  In my books, the place was not really utilized to maximize it's potential plus it didn't look well kept.  Needless to say, you can't beat the classic Vietnamese cuisine here.  I started with Shrimp spring rolls.  Generally I would go with something fried like eggrolls, but for some reason I shot for this and I was not disappointed.  Dipped with the sweet Hoisin sauce and spicy chili  gave this a classic appetizer a kick and aromatic refreshing bite.  Next up was of course my comfort food, Pho!  The broth really brings this dish home for me and here at Pho Viet Nam it definitely did so.  As I peered into the kitchen I see a family at work busting out dish after dish as if it was in their own home.    In the end, Pho Viet Nam is a new must go Pho place for me.  I think overall I totally appreciate my Pho made by mom and pops in the back room and find it comforting to say. - Enjoy!

Angry Crab Shack is pretty much a watered down version of the Boiling Crab famous in the LA County area.  Needless to say, give this place some time.  They're still working out the kinks according to owner Ron.  He is a good man and I trust he will make necessary adjustments to improve and bring to the valley our first Cajun crawfish eatery.    Here are some necessary improvements...service isn't the best.  I get it, but that will come in time as management steps up the training.  Missing items on the menu...living in a desert I don't expect to have fresh seafood.  The Cajun sauce is okay at best too thick and sandy...needs to be broken down more so I don't get a mouthful of seasoning!  More mixing I guess would help.  The food needs to be steamed longer.  I ate some cold corn and some of the items in the middle were cool.  Granted cooked, but not hot enough...Crawfish baked or any seafood at this style of cooking should be steaming hot and almost burning my tongue when I eat it...I expect that.    The place is decor similar to the Boiling Crab, but with some extra tackiness and not necessarily a good thing.  It's like an RC cola compared to Coke...just not the same.    In the end, I'll wait another 6 months before my return.  Hopefully, you'll see a better review.  As for now, stay tuned! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - B-52's - Love Shack)  Angry Crab Shack is a crawfish place where we can eat together Angry Crab Shack baby (a-crab shack, baby)  Angry Crab Shack, baby, Angry Crab Shack Angry Crab Shack, baby, Angry Crab Shack  Bang Bang Bang on the table baby Raw oysters on the plate, baby Bang Bang Bang on the table baby I can taste it  Bang, bang (On the table, baby) Bang, bang (On the table) Bang, bang (On the table, baby) Bang, bang Your what? Ten pounds, Yelped it!  When I first came to Angry Crab Shack I was a tad bit disappointed, but I said I would give this place time to get adjusted.   Needless to say, I'm glad I did so as I came back this time around, it was much better.  The place was still tacky like most crawfish joints.  Décor is definitely not their forte.  The place was loud and smelly just like the way it should be!  Service is still a little too slow for my taste, but the place was popping.  No excuses made here, but feel they need to improve on that respect.    My friends and I ordered a pound of crawfish each along with some oysters and blue crab.  The crawfish this time around was much better.  Spicy as heck and messy to eat!  The crawfish soaked in the spicy sauce really covered the fishy smell I distaste from all seafoods.  Like most crawfish; little meat, but so worth it!  Our oysters were perfect with added lime/lemon and some tabasco sauce of course; making this dish a must every time you come!  My blue crabs were sweet as it should be and boy was it good to eat some steamed blue crab again.  Overall, great atmosphere and great food.  Generally, I feel crawfish boil joints are for fun with just friend having drinks and cracking away.  Don't usually get full from these places, but definitely worth attending for some fun and food! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Pharrell Williams - Happy)  It might seem crazy what i'm about to eat Scottsdale it's here, you can take a bite I'm Bo Bites a writer that could go to space Yelping fair, like I really care baby by the way  At the Slanted Rice Come along if you feel like a drink without a proof At the Slanted Rice Come along if you feel like Vietnamese food is for you At the Slanted Rice Come along if you know what happiness is to you At the Slanted Rice Come along if you feel like that's what you wanna eat   I'm not sure if I should be offended or just shut-up and eat!  At first, I'm sure the slanted part got my feelings hurt, but once I walked and tried the food I was delighted!  I'm not a person easily offended needless to say.  I came here with a couple of my vegetarian friends on a Saturday night.    The owner was serving us and kept us company all night!  I started with the appetizer Pho and some eggrolls.  The eggrolls had a perfect crunchy shell with a warm and moist stuffing of pork and vegetables, it was a pow to my "Mou"!  Okay, bad joke aside, it was an eggroll worth ordering.  My appetizer Pho, which to my surprise; how do you make Pho and appetizer!?  Well they did and it worked since it gave me the opportunity to try other entrees without feeling too full.  The Pho broth was perfectly warm and pungent to my nose.  Fresh herbs and sprouts came along the plate and the overall size of it was just enough to wet the palate!   For my entree I shot for the Crispy Shrimp and Garlic Noodles while my vegetarian buddies went for the clay hot pot and  stir fry Vermicelli Noodles with Tofu of course!  Starting with mines, the crispy shrimp was doused with a spicy aioli, but the crunchy coating was what me love this dish, the noodles was dry ramen with a strong garlic and parmesan bite; definitely unique to my palate!  My buddies said they loved their vegetarian dish and I couldn't help but eat off their plate; mainly the clay hot pot!  The clay hot pot dish is a must order here; it made the rice at the bottom of the dish a crusty burn shell but man!  I freakin' loved it!  I think I ate half of it while finishing my own dish!  It came with a medley of marinated vegetables and your choice of protein; gotta say the mushroom in this dish was phenomenal!   Overall, the ambiance was chill and the place had a Victorian Posh feel.  Service was tops and we were showered with love....and drinks....and dessert haha!  -  Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Rihanna ft. Kanye West & Paul McCartney - Four Five Seconds)  I think I've had enough I might get a little drunk I say what's on my mind This place brings me back in time Cause all of my reviews Is singing for Yelpers  Now I'm Yelping Second Story Liquor Bar! And I got 5 more stars till Friday I'm just trying to munch and write by Monday morning I swear I wish somebody would tell me Ooh, that's all I want   This place is totally cute and sauve. I came here with my Yelp friends after a party with the gang.  Second Story Liquor Bar is on the 2nd floor obviously and almost felt like a speakeasy as we climbed the stairs.  There was a band playing some jazz while you can here murmurs among the crowd.  It was dark indeed.  As we sat we all ordered a cocktail to start.  They had some old fashion cocktails from the hey days of the 20s and 30s, but also some modern takes on some of them.  For our food I went for the Cockles & Mussels; a saffron tomato broth with a polenta base while the cockle clams and mussels were littered around.  Overall, a definitely a cold weather bite since it helped warmed the soul.  My friends ordered the Buttermilk & Teff Pasta and the Foie Gras.  I had a bite of the teff pasta and thought it freshly made, but very clean and it gave me a healthy feel.  The star of the night for me was the Foie Gras; beautifully plated with a towering milk bread with toasted coconut and passion fruit.  The duck was cooked to perfection with a night toasty crunch shell.    Overall, I like Second Story Liquor Bar because the ambiance is very chill and a place I can definitely hangout for a drink or two.  The food is unique and presented very well.  In the end, this is my new ace! - Enjoy!

I have to say I'm disappointed in this place.  My Banh Mi was anything but decent.  With a bread baking machine that looks like a time machine you'd think this place would blow your mind.    Sigh!  In the end, I feel like their Banh Mi is very new school.  Doesn't have that strong pungent smell like most Vietnamese sandwiches.  The taste was pretty plain since there wasn't a lot of protein.  I got a lot of the pickled carrots and fresh cilantro, but that's about it.  The bread was decent at best.  My Vietnamese coffee was okay, but very small portions.    In the end, I'm sad to say I wasn't impressed even though I had high hopes for this place.  I'll give it another run when I'm in need of Banh Mi or coffee. - Enjoy!

Came here on a Wednesday night with a buddy of mines.  The place was pretty quiet, but that's fine with me.  I ordered a couple of drinks and some Chicken Fingers while my buddy just ordered a side of fries.  The Chicken Fingers were okay, but probably something I wouldn't order again.  My buddies fries were okay.    Needless to say, the place is huge!  Almost too big I say.  Felt like the crowd was separated from each other making the place feel like a ghost town.  My opinion is you need to condense the space you have somehow so the place looks busy and packed.  Another problem was signage.  If my buddy didn't tell me this place existed I wouldn't even have known.  Upstairs patio is great and all, but no one can see this place and there's no real signs to direct traffic up stairs to the bar.  I always say that spot upstairs is cursed.  I've seen 2-3 bars disappear from that location, but I hope the best for Stadium Sports Grill -- My return is slim, but I always like to give place a 2nd try.  In the end, service was very good and food needs improvements. - Enjoy!

I came here on a Monday night and the place was poppin!  I sat at the bar viewing their craft brew menu on the way.  Seems like they have 2 special beers on a weekly basis, but you have to ask the server what kind.  Unfortunately, they're generally IPAs and I'm not a fan.  I shot for an Amber Ale while my friend ordered a mix drink.    For our food I went for the Chicken & Dumplings and my friend the Jerk Chicken Salad.  The Chicken & Dumplings was okay in my books.  It came with chicken, balls of dumpling, carrots, and sugar snap peas.  The peas gave it some crunch, but I wanted more texture; some shaved fried tortilla shells might have done the job plus it needed some spiced up kick.  I thought the dish overall would have made a perfect chicken pot pie stuffing.  My friends jerk chicken was spicy in my books; but she didn't care for the extra char on the chicken; plus it was dry.  Though the citrus dressing and avocado salad was an excellent combination.    In the end, the place had a cool vibe and probably a place to chill for some craft brews and appetizer bites.  The service was really on top of things, but overall the food was okay at best. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Restless Heart - When She Cries)  The place I have traveled in Is Yelped with good reviews It's littered with several stars That only quite came true  When all of my peers were drinking Her food kept me trying She does her best to cook The meal that Bo Bites been through  El Chullo's tonight And I really think that I should taste it It can't hide All the meals they make inside  El Chullo serves up some authentic Peruvian style food!  I just got back from Peru and unfortunately they don't serve Cuy! Now that would be authentic! In any case, my foodie friends and I ordered individually but different dishes. I went with the Tallarin Saltado, a spaghetti like dish with beef. Overall, it was pretty solid. Salty and just a tad bit of spice, with the crunch of the raw onions giving this dish a savory bite!  However, my 2 favorites of the night were the beef heart and the fried rice! Beef heart anyone!? Yeah, it came a super spicy sauce you can add and when I say be careful.....BE CAREFUL! Youch! Spicy indeed, but the heart was so tender....uh yummy! The fried rice...I thought my mama made good fried rice; sorry mom! Overall, one of the best bite of fried rice I had in a while. It was a blend of Peruvian and Chinese style so I totally appreciate the fusion and so will you!  The service was spot on with our large group plus no mix up with our checks, which is totally awesome. The place is very tiny so be sure to make your reservations! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Sam Smith - I'm Not The Only One)  Yelp and me, we made a vow For better or for worse I know you wouldn't let me down But the proof's in the way it taste For months on end I've had no doubts  Eating everywhere I wish I could come over now But I know that you'll be there  I say I'm hungry Cause Scottsdale just around the corner But when is Happy Hour I go to Hula's Modern Tiki!   Hula's Modern Tiki Scottsdale is a 2nd location to the popular Tiki off Central in Phoenix.  Overall, Hula's Modern Tiki still the same concept and design; a 50's style luau with a modern twist in drinks and food.  I came on a late Tuesday night to catch the game and hang with a buddy of mines from Los Angeles.  He was flabbergasted by the prices, "They're so cheap compared to where I'm from", Yes I agreed.  Plus, we have water and I'm sure glad I don't have to over pay for food here in the valley!    Hula has daily Happy Hour specials so check them out, but tonight I shot for a IPA and ordered the Habanero Chicken Tacos while my buddy went for the Loco Moco.  My dish was pretty darn spicy and I'm sure they used just a tad bit of habanero, but it worked with marinated shredded chicken while the crunchy cabbage slaw provided some texture.  The avocado is always a welcome and the sweet aioli balanced it out pretty well.  I didn't even use my salsa since I thought the dish was well put together.  Only thing was I didn't care for the corn tortilla since it was definitely store bought; I rather have it freshly made and would have made this dish kickass!  My buddies dish was a "traditional" Hawaiian meal.  To me it was a Salisbury hamburger patty atop a bed of rice and a fried egg over everything.  He rather enjoyed it, but I didn't really care for it.    In the end. Hula's is still a hot spot for Happy Hour whether in Phoenix or Scottsdale.  The food is a fusion of Hawaiian and Southwest with some modern American funk.  Service is pretty good and overall and solid spot! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Bruno Mars - Just The Way You Are)  Oh their sauce, their sauce Make me give them stars while I'm writing Their food, their food Comes perfectly at Foosia for biting It's so beautiful And I want it every day  Yeah I know, I know  When I compliment them I Hope you believe me And its so, its so Good to think it sees what I see But every time it asks me to Bo Bites I say okay   Foosia is a healthy Asian Fusion style restaurant made to your order and liking.    At first site this place is very similar to your typical Chipotle.  Start ordering with a base of lettuce or rice and then moving on with your proteins.  Next is your vegetable selections and sauce.  I went from a lettuce bowl with steak and vegetables.  Then added the mango lime sauce with some cilantro, bean sprouts, cucumbers, fried won tons, and a tad bit of Thai red chili.  Overall my entree was solid and definitely fresh to the bite.  I'm generally not a fan of eating a lot of Asian food simply because of the way it's cooked and how my love handles would hate me for it, but Foosia has solved my problem!  Fresh ingredients cooked under a calorie conscious menu with exotic funky named sauces to provide a POW to your mouth like, Holy Foobanero, Two Nuts Walk Into a Bar, and Okinawan Pineapple Pow!    In the end, Foosia is hot and high especially with a more healthy and environmentally aware food culture.  As the push for a non-GMO ingredient continues I can see Foosia on the cusp of a new food revolution! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Spin Doctors - Little Miss Can't Be Wrong)  Been a whole lot hungrier since it came to town Been a whole lot happier with that place around Everybody in Phoenix's gonna stomp and shout Everybody lined up out back gonna wait around He holds the brisket while you dote-se-doe I want one cut made of sausage and pork ribs  Been a whole lot hungrier since it came to town Little Miss , Little Miss , Little Miss BBQ  Little Miss , Little Miss , Little Miss BBQ Every bodies gonna wait in line when you open your doors Little Miss , Little Miss , Little Miss BBQ Whatcha go 'n' do to get into another one of these here rock 'n' roll songs?  This place is legit!  Too legit to quit...to eat.  Okay it's not Hammer time, but boy I hammered away at my plate when I finally got to eat!  I came here on a whim since I've heard about this place.  Didn't think I could ever make it, but I did finally.  There was a big line already when I got here, but I was gonna do it!  I recommend parking else around the area and walk there cause you'll need that walk after you eat!  My buddy and I decided to go all out and ordered as much as we could; Pork ribs, beef brisket, sausages, and beef ribs.  Needless to say, the meat was tender and if slide off the bones and as you pulled them off.  The aroma itself made your mouth watery!  Be ready to eat with your hands and napkins, napkins, napkins is a must for your hands and face!  On all the tables came with 3 homemade BBQ sauces, which were phenomenal and was based on the amount of heat you can handle.  The meats were all definitely slow cooked in large vats of steam broilers.  Man I could still smell it and you I swear I started to salivate as I stood in line!    Overall, one of the best spots in Phoenix for sure and must go.  Yes if you must play hooky from work or school and go for it.  I give you permission! - Enjoy!

The place is hip and hopping, order in line and pick a seat kind of place.  I went with the Meat Lovers Scramble and cup of Americana coffee -- why don't they just call it a cup of Joe!  Anyways, they even have breakfast pizza here! Cowabunga!  That's definitely new and something I'll go for next time around.  My Meat Lovers was yummy, Applewood bacon, ham, sausage, and Monterey Jack cheese in a mesh of eggs and hash browns!  A running mans breakfast haha!  The bacon brought the saltiness, while the melted cheese supplied the sweet mush and the hash browns was a hit with the crunch.  Add some hot sauce and yippy!  Overall, great place for breakfast and brunch; plus it's down the street from where I live so that's always a plus in my books! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Bell Biv Devoe - Poison)  Hey I must tell you......! I sense something tasty in my mouth Situation is serious......! Let's try it cause we're running out of time It's oh so delicious.....! Bo Bites reviews they seem from the start It's all so lyrical......! When food is ready from the start  It's driving me out of my mind! That's why it's not hard for me to try Can't get it out of my mouth Miss it, taste it, love it That place is GOGI......!  Solid! Solid as a rock!    GOGI delivers to me in my book...and palate!  Located in the heart of what I call the Phoenix Asian mecca, GOGI's location is perfect to showcase to the Asian community.  GOGI's is modern and subtle like a model home display.  Not my cup of tea I guess.  Service was spot on though and very attentive and helpful when my buddy and I needed some suggestions.    We started with the Seafood Pancakes, which came with a ponzu-like sauce in a bowl full of jalapeno peppers.  Overall a nice start, the pancakes were nice and soft in the middle and crunchy at the edges with small cuts of calamari giving it some extra texture.  For our entree with shot for the Spicy Pork Belly and the Bulgogi Beef Hot Stone Bowl.  Boy did we hit the jackpot!  The Spicy Pork Belly was somewhat fatty, but overall the taste was music to my palates.  Tender with a hint of chewiness, the flavors was sweet and spicy; I could eat this all day with some rice!  Our Bulgogi beef hot bowl came with of course Bulgogi beef, bean sprouts, slivered carrots, spinach, cucumbers, and crusty rice....yeahhhh!  I love it when the rice at the bottom of the bowl  hardens giving this entree a crunchy punch.  They give you a sweet red sauce to liven up the dish since you can definitely smell and taste the strong sesame sauce oil they use to cook it.    Overall my kind of place to come to!  Seems like a family owned spot with some care and love to the craft.  In the end, it's an A in my books! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics The Rolling Stones - Paint It Black)  I see the Red Thai and I want to try it out So many options I want to eat them all I see Chef Chu walk by dressed in his kitchen clothes I have to try the shrimp and some more eggrolls   I see a line of peeps and they're here for Red Thai With mixed drinks and a beer, both always worth a come back I start to Bo Bite and quickly rate away Unlike a newbie Yelper I just Bo Bite everyday   Local celebrity Chef Johnny Chu's Red Thai is a new restaurant offering up Vietnamese and Thai fusion food.  As you walk towards the restaurant, you'll notice his signature night light theme; violet, bold red, and let's not forget statue of Buddha!  As I walked into the main room, first thing I notice was Anime movies playing across the walls behind the bar.  The wall is literally the screen projector.  Overall, the place gave off a nice vibe and energy!  I came here with a group and as we ordered our drinks and we couldn't wait to be seated to order some bites!  We started off with some appetizers; Spicy Mint Shrimp, Thai Fried Chicken, Saigon Egg Rolls.  All sounds pretty exotic and it was.  I have to proclaim this; I love the Spicy Mint Shrimp!  I could eat that sauce with rice any day and any time!  Spicy indeed, while the onions and mint gave it a pungent aroma along with some texture!  The Thai Fried Chicken was good and crispy and cooked to perfection; the way it should be! The Saigon Eggs Rolls was a nice compliment to finalize our appetizer round; nice and crunchy along with a refreshing papaya salad.    Moving on to the entree we ordered the Sweet Ginger Fish.  The Thai ginger sauce was definitely sweet and it was glazed over chunks of breaded fish.  Overall, I liked it, but not as much as my appetizers.  The sauce was okay, but I would have liked to see the entire fish fried and battered then glazed with the sauce.  I think I'm an old school Asian that can appreciate that sort of presentation. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Foreigner - I Want To Know What Love Is)  In my life there's been reviews with stars I'm pretty sure I can eat it again Can't stop now, I've Bo Bites so far To give this place a try.......  I wanna go to the Brass Tap I really want to show you I wanna go to the Brass Tap I know I can show you  Nestle inside the heart of Mesa Riverview complex is The Brass Tap.  With over 20 locations nationwide the Mesa location is the first in Arizona.  Lucky us!  The Brass Tap provides a nice, clean, and homey feel to your beer brewery.  A selection of craft brews along with your regular store bought beer available in a bottle or draft.   I came on a Saturday night with a friend and order several different beers to try out while a solo singer rocked out on the early 90s music.  Pretty awesome and chilling night in my book.  I also ordered their pretzel crusted pizza; yep that's pretty new to me!  Overall, the pretzel dough was original and surprisingly it worked well.  Tad bit over salty for sure, but I guess that helps sell the beer!  In the end, a great atmosphere along with great selection.  The pizza was interesting and something I would recommend to try! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Daniel Powter - Bad Day)  You stand in the line just to hit a new place You're taking a smile with a drink to go You tell me your taste been way off line You're falling to pieces every time And we should go Bo Biting on....  We want Shabu Shabu We're talkin Shabu Fondue We try a hot pot just to share it around You say you don't know What you want me to try You cook some bok choy and you go for the beef  We had a good day The cameras don't lie We're coming back down and we really don't mind We had a good day We had a good day  Overall and pretty hot spot for some hot pots!  I came here with a friend whom never been to Shabu before in her life!  What the heck girls been  missing out; poor thing!  Needless to say I was proud to have introduced her to the meal.  She was a vegetarian so we went for the vegetarian broth; Coconut Curry and Tum Yum.  The curry broth was a little to spicy for the both of us and the Tum Yum was perfect.  The pot itself is duel pot so splitting and sharing was perfect!    As for the food we spent the night cooking Baby Bok Choy, Korean Melons, Flat Rice Noodles, Shabu Beef, Scallops, Broccoli, Fish Balls, and Watercress.  Doesn't seem like a lot but boy when you start to cook and eating its a mouthful!  Overall, experience was excellent!  I love Shabu and Shabu Fondue delivers to my liking.  The atmosphere is modern and hot with a funky Asian theme.  Red Thai is next door was a full on bar to finish the night and dessert so why not huh! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Bruce Springsteen - Hungry Heart)  Got a wife and kid in Phoenix, Dave I went out for a bite and for some lobster bisque Like a restaurant that know hows it going I ate a sandwich and I just kept going  Vermont Sandwich got a hungry heart Vermont Sandwich got a hungry heart Lay down your appetite and you play your part Vermont Sandwich got a hungry heart   Let's just say I got special treatment in a way.    My friend is a friend of David the owners, so I had the opportunity to sit down and chat with him.  He wanted to bring a NE Coast atmosphere to his establishment; yeah sounds pretty crazy to me too!  In a desert!?  Anyways, why not it's different plus they make their own sauces, baked goods, and cure their own deli meats.    My partner and I started with eating some cookies and fresh made lemonade.  Yeah, I know lets start with dessert first!  I'm not much of a cookie guy but I definitely appreciate fresh squeezed lemonade!  For our lunch we ordered The Long Trail to share while once every end of the month David says he makes homemade Lobster Bisque soup.  Once a month; well sign me up today!   The Long Trail came with roastbeef, bacon, peppered horseradish, Muenster cheese, and the fixings in a grilled panini as we wanted it to be.  The crunchiness of the bread and sting of the horseradish sauce brought out the flavors of the soft chewiness of the roastbeef while the hint of bacon packed a salty bite!  My favorite of the day had to be the Lobster Bisque soup and you know what.....I don't like to eat Lobster!  Yep, I said it, but if made a specific way like the Vermont Sandwich Co. did;  I'll take it!  Warm and creamy with crunchy fresh onions while the lobster itself was not stringy; which I think all lobster taste like!    In the end, we were a few people in the restaurant, but definitely got the love and attention of David.  Very good people making an honest living while providing an East Coast comfort to those who miss it most! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Murray Head - One Night in Bangkok)  Topgolf, Occidental setting But Scottsdale does know what the city is getting The creme de la cream of the golf world In a game with everything but Tiger Woods  Time flies - doesn't seem a minute Since the Arizona Casino spa is just across from it All changed, don't you know that when you Play at this level there's no ordinary venue It's Tempe, or Chandler, or Gilbert Or Or this place!  One night at Topgolf and the world's your oyster The bars are open but their drinks aren't free   Top Golf ... what is the rave about!?  Needless to say this place is pretty awesome.  I'm not much of a golfer but I can see the fun in coming here to wack the hell out of a golf balls while pounding down a few drinks.    The place itself is huge; 3 floors of fun and a central bar inside.  The crowd and staff is lively and service seems on key. Though I'm sure they have seen and dealt with the worst; dealing with drunk golfers - ishh!  I came here for a birthday party and didn't seem like any of our orders missed a beat.  I ordered a beer and a some chicken tacos and had a taste of the Mushi, a burrito like appetizer stuffed with beans, rice, cilantro, cheese, and chicken.  It's shaped like a sushi thus I gather the name Mushi. My thought, well mushy indeed it was since it felt it was just a bunch of "mushy" ingredients stuffed together in a roll; I appreciate stepping outside the box, but please stay shut Pandora's Box!  My chicken tacos however were awesome! Crispy taco shell stuffed with smoked chicken and atop with a slaw.  Smoky it was while the shell and the slaw provided a textural crunch to every bite.  Perfect to go along with my beer.  It has some heat along, but the cabbage slaw helped calm it down.  Overall, a darn good bite for a fun golf place! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - The La's - There She Goes)  A--Ki--Ta Akita Sushi Review with my brain And I just can't contain This taste that remains  A--Ki--Ta Akita Sushi Bo Bites thru my site... And I just can't contain This taste that remains  Sushi buffet time!   I came on a Friday night with my group.  ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi/sashimi for $20 - count me in!  I went for sashimi; mackerel, tuna, salmon, tempura vegetable, and the Volcano Roll.  The sashimi to me was pretty good and basic and so was the tempura vegetable.  The Volcano roll came with tuna, crab, cucumber and deep fried while drizzled with chipotle mayo, siracha, and a brown sweet sauce I couldn't make out. I would say this combo worked well.    Things got more interesting when Chef Sam came out to speak to us about what he can do and make for us; so I was like well show us what you can do!  Thus, he made us some specialties; Smoky Roll, Nanuto Roll, and Ninja Roll.  The Smoky roll was crab meat, seaweed salad, topped with yellowtail, salmon roe and doused with mayo and brown sauce; and yes you can taste the smoke, which was the interesting part.  The Ninja roll was a clean roll; no rice, just wrapped with seaweed was tuna, crab, avocado, and topped with wasabi aioli.  The Nanuto roll, my favorite of the night, was again a clean roll; wrapped with cucumber, salmon, tuna, roe, and drizzled with ponzu sauce!  Overall the experience took a 180 once Chef Sam came out to speak to us and show us is specialty!  Service overall was on top of things and the place was clean and welcoming.  In the end, gotta thank Chef Sam for making this a wonderful experience! - Enjoy!

Not bad for a steak joint up in Bally's!  I sat at the bar dining alone that night.  The bartender and servers were very attentive and never once I felt pushed away.  I ordered me a glass of tempranillo; ding nice indeed.  I went with the hanger steak and side of potato skins.  They brought me some starters, which to my surprise were very good especially if you're a table bread person.  They're popover bread is no joke and pretty darn good along with some sea salt.  The hanger steak was perfectly cooked; nice and tender with a tab bit of a crush on the outside to give a crunch - Yum!    Overall, great experience and couldn't ask for anything more.  Great service and food! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Weezer - Say It Ain't So)  Bo Bites is coming Is gonna review Somebody's restaurant Is giving me thrills Guess I'll just give them a try  Oh yeah, alright, taste good, so right  Yelp on the website AZCulture with Warren Something is brewing Behind my site Bo Bites is ready to blow  At The Revival....ooh oh Your food is a heartbreaker At The Revival....ooh oh Your food is a life maker  The Revival is a little off key place away from the crowded Mill Ave.  My first impression of the place was wow this would be a cool place to hang with a live band!  The place serves up what I would consider Southwestern and American fusion food.    I came here with a date on a Wednesday night so the place was pretty slow overall.  I didn't care for having the staff hanging at the bar since as a manager of the business; that bothers me much.  I ordered a Whiskey and ginger and proceeded with ordering for the both of us.  The menu was split from small versus large plates.  We shot for the small plates so we can share.  We ordered the Braised Duck Taquitos, Steamed Mussels, and Patty's Fish Tacos.  The mussels were excellent for a chilly night as it was when we attended; warm chipotle-chorizo sauce giving it an extra kick of spice along with some crustini bread.  The fish tacos had a subtle bite and a minor kick of chipotle; crunch from the cabbage, but one thing I notice most was the corn tortilla which tasted homemade.  The duck taquitos was well plated, topped with radish and red onions and surrounded by a tomatillo and pablano sauce -- Oh yeah probably my favorite of the night.    We finished the night with some Mexican Chocolate and brownie to an already great night of eats.  Overall, a great place for a foodie to grab some experimental bites! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - The Pointer Sisters - Fire)  I'm trying out your pie You turning out your dough You're adding some sauce I just say whoa I say I really like it But you know I'm a Yelper Cause when I sing Ooooh, Fired....(Pie)   Quick, simple, and good!  Fired Pie is a local chain spread throughout the Phoenix valley.    I came here with a friend whom said their salads were amazing!  Well in a pizza joint I'm not ordering salad first off.  I'm sure they're great, but pizza is what I'm shooting for!  Pick and choose your topping is the pretty much the concept.  I chose mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, artichokes, peppercini peppers, capicola and bacon.  Fire roasted in an open fire oven this toasted the thin crust giving it an extra crunch.  The proteins I chose were chewy and salty as it should be, while the peppers provided and fresh pickley bite.  I love artichokes on my pizza since it has it's own distinct smell and taste.    Overall, Fired Pie is unique and fun!  Their service is quick and ordering is simple. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Lisa Loeb - Stay)  You say I only write what I want to You say I eat so all the time...so And I thought what I ate was simple And I thought that I should review And now that I am finished Now you hope that you did something right cause you fed me Yeah, yeah, you fed me  And you say I only write what I want to I Yelp lyricals I Yelp with intentions of dictations that you're listening or to any words, any place You don't understand if I really care But you only see positive: stars, stars, stars  At...Sushi....J   Had to cut the song short so I may review! Sorry Lisa Loeb fans but you all can finish it yourselves! Haha!  Sushi J is a little hot sushi spot located behind the scenes of Oldtown.  Sushi J provides a warm cozy welcome compared to the buzzing night scene.  I came here with a a couple of good friends.  Needless to say, I've known chef Jay for quite some times and it was good to see him again behind the sushi table.    We started with some edamame and sake bombers to wet our palates.  As for the entree we ordered the Marylin MonRoll, Geisha Roll, and the Prince of Persia.  The Marylin MonRoll came as a rice-less roll; wrapped with rice sheets and within Lobster mix, cucumbers, avocado, mango and cilantro.  Overall, reminded me of a spring roll with lobster, but a solid start since if anything I'd rather eat a rice-less roll - low carb!  The Geisha was a regular rice wrap and came with crab meat, cucumbers, shrimp tempura and topped with tuna and avocado; served with yuzu and Siracha sauce.  I would say this was my favorite of the night because I always enjoy a crunchy and spicy roll.  The Prince of Persia came with Ahi Tuna, avocado, green onion, tempura and served with ginger garlic sauce and Siracha.  Again, a crunchy and spicy roll which I love, but this one had that extra garlic aroma and bite to it.  I came back a 2nd time with a foodie friend of mines and this time we shot for the Sushi Omakase tailored to our price point.  Totally awesome!  Our omakase came with Uni roll, a spicy tuna hand roll, and a plate of sashimi.  I totally love the Uni Roll; creamy to the bite and a burst of the taste of the sea.  Our sashimi came with Yellowtail, Yellowfin Tuna, fish liver paste, tuna belly and scallops.  Overall, a solid dish and I can't say enough about each bite.  Fresh as can be and and seared to perfection!  In the end, I really enjoyed my visit to Sushi J.  I think it's one of the few better sushi joints around town and plus I live close by!  The service is good and the amount of specialty sushi is  plentiful. - Enjoy!

Pretty hip spot for a burger joint, but overall cool.  I came with my 2 sisters to check this place out.  Overall, the place reminds me of a Smashburger, but unfortunately without a smash!  I ordered the Bacon Cheese burger while my sisters order the cheesy 4 pack and the Cinco burger.  The Cinco burger came with jalapenos, gaucamole, salsa, jack cheese, your burger fixings on a sesame bun.  Overall, a good looking burger and my sister was delighted.  I'm a bacon burger snob!  Mines came with the fixings, applewood bacon, american cheese on a brioche bun.  In the end, I thought it was good, but nothing really stood out for me.  I guess what's really cool about this place is the sauces available to your choosing; Thai ketchup, toasted marshmellows, Ragin Cajun, Apple Cider, etc.    The place itself pushes for a modern flare with a young vibrant service crowd.  In the end, it's a cool place to hangout, but didn't really captivate me! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Def Leppard - Pour Some Sugar On Me)  Yelp is like a bomb, Bo Bites, c'mon get it on Yelping like a foodie with an iPhone Looking like a plan, like an Elite Event Capital Grille, can I be your man?  Wining and dining and a Generous Pour Pinot Noir lover, Bo Bites, go all night Riesling, anytime, sugar me sweet Little miss Lindsey come sip with me, yeah  Hey! C'mon, take a bottle, uncork it up Break the seal, break it up  Pour some wine for me Ooh, in the name of Yelp Pour some wine for me C'mon, fire me up Pour your wine for me Oh, I can't get enough  I sneaked and I peeked with Yelp and Lindsey at the Capital Grille! Indeed it was a night of fun and yum; along with some fine wine and delectable dinning.  We were educated and pampered by some of the best service in town and the ambiance made us all feel like we were sitting in first class!  Generous Pour is an interesting program to showcase some of the popular wines available in stores now in specific locations, but also a way to enjoy a taste of what The Capital Grille had to offer.  Needless to say, I'm not wine connoisseur but I do enjoy me a bottle or two!  Along with some of the best pairing I've had in some times, this was an event definitely for the Elites! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Sir Mix-A-Lot - Baby Got Back)  I like to kick butt and I cannot lie You other Yelpers can't deny That you want to walk out with an itty bitty waist And Eric's all up in your face  You get "Pushed", wanna pull out your tough Cause you notice your heart rate was stuck Deep in the monitor you're wearing I'm hooked and I can't stop running  Oh Orange, Theory's gonna get you And take your heartrate My Yelpers tried to warn me But afterward Flower Child makes me so, so, hungry!  Double the fun this time around - First stop at Orange Theory Fitness where Eric motivated and "Kicked our Yelp Butts"!  Needless to say it was quite an experience and fun time working out with the Yelpers of all levels.  The heart rate monitor really helped with the motivation.  I had tough time getting to the red zone, but apparently it was only good to stay at that point for 5 or less minutes -- therefore I did well - wink!  Constant motion on the floors from steps, push-ups, row machines, pistol squats, ball hops and dumbells; this was quite intense!  The treadmills was my strength; from pacing to all out sprints!  Round 2 was at Flower Child.  A farm to table concept restaurant brought to us by Mr. Fox.  This place has a breakfast table open feel, but serves up some delicious fresh organic ingredients.  I went for the Thai Buckwheat Noodles with Salmon!  Salmon was well cooked, but next time I'll shoot for the chicken.  The dish came with some buckwheat noodles, of course, avocado, mint, radish, thai basil, roasted mushroom, cashews, sesame, and fish sauce.  Overall, it seems like a bunch of ingredients to taste, but it worked.  Nice fresh and crunchy salad with an aromatic bite!    In the end, gotta thank Ms. Lindsey for another great fun event.  Next rounds on us! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Madonna - Take A Bow)  The Normal, the meal is starting This food review is getting better Nostalgic, the 8 tracks post Bo Bites is here Bring your drinks but do you taste it Do you mean what you serve when there's Bo Bites around  Watching you, watching me, four happy stars I've always been wanting to try out you I guess you've always known it's true I took your location for granted, why oh why This food is awesome, say Oh-My!   Baw-chika Baw Baw is more like it.....bringing the 70s back!  There is nothing normal about The Normal unless we jumped in a time machine and went "back to the future"!  The place is a welcoming change and definitely stylish with nostalgia.  I came with a date and we generally like to order a lot to try a little bit of this and that.  To start we went with a side of Red Velvet Waffles (yeah right!?), then a TC Chopped Salad.  For entrees we ordered The Bison Burger and chef Blackboard; which was chefs choice of the day....or time; it was actually beef brisket street tacos.    The Red Velvet Waffles was definitely interesting, it a minor hit of red velvet cake taste, but not strong.  Fluffy and doughy at the same time and perfect with some butter and maple syrup.  The chopped salad came with pepitas, corn, blueberry raisins, couscous, and shredded chicken breast.  The pepitas and corn provided a crunchy and nutty bite while the raisins and couscous made it chewy and sweet; overall a solid healthy salad!  The BBQ brisket tacos were probably the star of the night.  Street as it should be and a spicy kick since it was topped with a couple red chili peppers!  Sprinkle it with some lime and bam we're golden!.  My least favorite of the meals was probably the Bison burger.  I've had Bison burger many times elsewhere and it is never good in my opinion.  The product should be left whole as a steak and to grind up such a premium ingredient is atrocious!  Needless to say, I didn't care for it.    The service was awesome thanks to our server Alex.  He was attentive and helpful with the menu.  Overall, a great place for some eats and to bring back some memories..... - Enjoy!

Came here on a Tuesday to watch the FIFA game.  The place is located inside The Graduate Hotel and from what I gather it was pretty dead.    I started by ordering some Happy Hour specials; chips and salsa and a beer.  For my entree I went for some tacos; pork shoulders and the chicken tacos.  I thought the chips and salsa was decent at best.  I would rather have fresh made chips and salsa; plus the salsa had a weird strong vinegar-like taste; both red and green.  The pork shoulder tacos were a tad bit cold my partner and I thought plus could use a little more kick and spice.  The thing I like about it is the pickled onions giving it some texture.  My chicken tacos was probably my favorite of the night.  I love avocados, but again would want some more spice to it and also more cabbage slaw for more texture.   In the end, Tapacubo was a nice place to visit and chill for drinks.  I didn't really care for the food and thought the chips and salsa at least be complimentary.  No Taco Tuesday!? - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - The Cranberries - Linger)  If you, if you could return, don't let it wait, don't let it fade I'm sure you're not being rude, and it's just your atmosphere, It's teasing me to stay, I want to try everything.  I ate, I ate and it was good, and cocktails, oh yes so good. So why am I holding back? Is that the way I stand?  I'm Bo Biting all the time, Yelp is just a game to me But I'm in so deep. You know I'm such a fool for you. You got me wrapped around your finger fries, ha, ha.  Do I have to go to Linger? Do I have to, do I have to, Do I have to let it Linger (Longer Lounge)   Spinning DJ, board game hoorahs, local draft beers, and cocktail specials; the linger indeed I shall and a littler longer as I lounge!  I finally made my way to this little gem.  At first the appearance of the place didn't seem to be happening and a little sketchy, but once I came in I realize this was definitely a spot I could relax and enjoy and few with some friends and be fine.  I ordered a draft IPA and shared the Prosciutto Grilled Cheese with fried zucchini with a friend.  A gal pal of mines went for the loaded fries which was all shared with the table.  The prosciutto grilled cheese was perfectly cooked; crunchy bread with warm melting cheese within, while the prosciutto provided a subtle saltiness to the sandwich.  The zucchini fries came along with ketchup and I believe to be a chipotle mayo.  I didn't care for it at all since I couldn't really taste the zucchini, but instead a crunchy mess.  The loaded fries were the star of the night.  Thick cut fries with jalapeno queso, bacon, chorizo, scallions, sour cream, and an over-easy egg.  What's not good with bacon and cheese!  With a hint of heat provided by the jalapeno and chorizo; boy my love handles are hating me, but damn it was good!  In the end, Linger Longer Lounge is a nice local bar with some lively pop to my surprise.  I rather enjoy the small town feel, but big town crowd.  The food is a hit or miss, but definitely not the loaded fries! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Maroon 5 - Sugar)  I don't wanna be hungry for lunch I just wanna be eating your food And it's killing me when I'm hungry ooh, Bo Bites Cause I really don't care where you are I just wanna be there when you open And I gotta get one little taste  Banh Mi Yes, please Won't you come and make some for me? I'm right here, 'cause I need Little spice and a lot of fresh veggies Yeah, you serve me good coffee Make it alright Need a little Banh Mi for my bite Banh Mi Yes, please Won't you come and make some for me?  No PHO FO sure!  I'm very happy to see Banh Mi Bistro try to educate the valley about Banh Mi sandwiches and Vietnamese cuisine which doesn't only encompasses the one and only - Pho!  Banh Mi Bistro showcases traditional Banh Mi along with other  sandwiches with more recognizable ingredients.    I went for the traditional Banh Mi; a French baguette with pickled carrots, daikon, cilantro, jalapeno, and Vietnamese ham and pate.  The bread was extra flaky and crunchy the way it should be while the cilantro and pickled vegetables brought a soothing and aromatic bite!  The sandwich itself is about 12 inches long so sharing is not a bad idea especially if you plan to get other items.  The second time I came around I went for the Noodle Bowl with pork and eggrolls.  Overall, a solid dish with fresh cut cucumbers, romaine lettuce, crispy eggrolls and Vietnamese seasoned pork served with a sweet and spicy hot sauce.  I like mines with a bit of a kick so I added some Siracha.  The bowl itself is well portioned in my opinion; not too much and not too less.  I also ordered me the Vietnamese ice coffee; a potent caffeinated coffee with condensed milk be prepared to stay away!   In the end, the place was clean and modern.  The service and staff seemed very genuine and helpful educating their patrons along with welcoming back regular customers.  Overall and A+ from Bo Bites! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Will Smith - Miami)  Here I am in the place where I come to eat the drinks and the street tacos Everyday in The Yard in all, everybody party all day No work all play, okay So we sip a little something, lay to rest the spill Me and Jenny at the bar runnin up a high bill Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill  Everytime the waiter pass, they be like (Hi Bo) Can y'all feel me, all drinks and cocktails Real spicy sauces Every different toppings, Chicken, Onions, Asada, Cilantro Pork, Steak, Cubano or Salsa  I only came to Bo Bites and playing But everytime I come I always wind up eating This the type of place I could spend a few days in Urbano the place that keeps the kitchen blazing  Party in The Yard where the heat is on All night, on the patio till the break of dawn Welcome to Urbanos Buenvenidos at Urbanos Bouncing in The Yard where the heat is on All night, on the patio till the break of dawn I'm going to Barrio Urbano Welcome to Urbanos   I think any place with the name Barrio is going to work especially here in the valley!  Barrio Urbano is located inside The Yard next to Cleo's.  I really enjoy the lively atmosphere these three places provide.  Great food and live entertainment yeah!  The only thing weird about it is that you can't bring food and drinks in and out of each restaurant as if you were in Vegas!    Needless to say, I wasn't too bummed.....maybe just a little.  I always seem to sit at the bar when I attend Barrio Urbano; ahem!  Drink menu please!  The bartender is very knowledgeable about Tequila and let's just say my favorite drink here is the El Picado; a spicy limey cocktail.  Food here is amazing with James Beard nominated Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza in the kitchen or at least creating some banging meals!  I went for the street tacos this time around starting with the Carne Asada, Pulled Pork, Fish Tacos, and the Chicken Avocado.  Overall, I love them!  The carne asada and pulled pork was tender and had limey cilantro bite.  The fish tacos was perfectly cooked and the cabbage provide a crunchy welcoming texture.  Finally, the chicken avocado was good, but definitely probably my least favorite of the four.    In the end, Barrio Urbano brings great Mexican food was a modern twist.  I love the atmosphere and the list of Tequila they have and I can't handle too much of it. - Enjoy!

I loved it when it was Gallo Blanco, but like all good things; it doesn't last.  I came here with a large group of one Friday night to now Cafe Tranquilo.  The place was pretty hip looking, but the crowd was nowhere to be found.  The place was quiet, too quiet for a Friday night.  As I sat I ordered a beer and like most Southwestern style restaurants chips and salsa was served with four different salsas; Pico de Gallo, Red Chili, Green Chili and creamy avocado.  My favorites were the Red and Green Chili; love the kick and the chips seemed like fresh cut tortillas fried...definitely nice start!  For my entree I shot for the Campechana Ahogada; a torta sandwich with ribeye steak, chorizo, avocado, tomato, cheese, eggs and a red sauce.  Definitely a larger dish then I expected.  The bun was nicely toasted, but protein ratio was definitely way off; maybe 2 cups of ribeye compared to a 8 inch bun.  The tomato didn't really add anything special except that is was there; if they were planning to give it some texture then that didn't help.  The egg was a nice compliment, but in the end it just wasn't enough.  I think a little more texture and something to compliment the red sauce would have made it work. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Tommy James & The Shondells - Crimson & Clover)  Oh Now I won't really know her But I think I could try her Kale and Clover  Ah Well I'm mindful of walking over Now I've been waiting to taste it Kale and Clover Over and over   Modern, green, fresh, and clean that's what I feel when I walk into this place.    Modern since this place is like walking into a interior designers home.  Green cause the place is organic and whole.  Fresh and clean, cause I feel like I was just walking through a rain forest that just got rained on; hopefully the interior designer doesn't have carpet haha!  I came here with my friend and we didn't know where to start, but shot for the a spicy ginger cayenne juice.  For our entrees we ordered the Kale & Clover Salad and the Seoul Food Bowl.  The ginger juice was spicy indeed plus sweet.  It was called the Cleanse and now I understand why; felt like I just went through a colon cleanse after drinking it!  The Kale & Clover Salad came with kale, apples, almonds, raisins, and sprouts with a sherry vinaigrette.  Overall, I liked the salad, but the kale was tough and bitter as it should be I guess.  Think adding another element to smooth it out would be great (i.e. mix of romaine).  The taste and crunch of the salad was perfect; apples and raisin helped with the sweetness.  We added beef to our Seoul bowl for some protein.  The bowl was filled with kimchee fried rice, mushrooms, carrots,  broccoli, bok choy, and an egg atop.  Kimchee in general is a strong flavor already.  Overall, the mushrooms gave it an extra flavor while the carrots, broccoli, and bok choy helped give this dish a crunch and welcoming subtle-ness from the already powerful flavors.  The egg for me was just an extra mellowness, but it works!    In the end, Kale & Clover deserves love and welcome from all that enjoys eating a clean and healthy meal. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Keith Sweat - Twisted)  Oh yeah Bo Bites I got to write my reviews up Yeah Yelpers, help me out  (You know you want my lovin) You know I want your cookin baby (At the Twisted Grove Parlor Bar) Yeah you got me twisted over you (They know they got what I need) I got what I need right here baby (So what you wanna do)   I loves this place! Twisted Grove has a rustic American feel and brunch here is perfect!  You have an option you make your own Bloody Mary here, but I'm not a big fan of making of my own drinks however I will try next time and see how I feel about it - wink!  I came here with my friend on a Saturday afternoon after a good hike.  For drinks I went for an IPA and she shot for the Sweet & Spicy cocktail; tequila, grassroots sour, jalapeno agave, and cayenne salt around the rim. Overall, a solid drink and I always enjoy a spicy drink, with a full half jalapeno atop!    For our food I ordered the Southern Sunrise; a Green Chile Tamale with house made chorizo and black bean pico.  My friend went for the Twisted Noodle Salad which came with buckwheat soba noodles, kale, avocado, mango, cucumber, arugula, scallions, herbs, coconuts, peanuts, chili-lime vinaigrette and shrimps.  My dish was phenomenal!  I love tamales in general, but the sweetness of the tortilla puree really brought out the taste.  The black bean pico was cooked to perfection with a hint of cilantro spiciness.  The chorizo had an over-easy egg atop; what doesn't go well with eggs these days!?  The salad had a shmorgishborg of ingredients that at the end, jelled well together.  It was crunchy and subtle with a sweet and sour punch to your palates!  Service was on top of things here and again; I love the ambiance!  Overall, the food played music to my palates and this is a definitely a star in my books! - Enjoy!

I came on a cold Wednesday evening with a friend for drinks and small bites.  The place looks pretty cool with some modern spunk.  The service was real attentive and quick with all our drink orders and food - kudos to that.  HH prices here are pretty decent for being in Scottsdale so that's a plus.  So far so good with the start.  We started with a Mango Fire, a tequila infused with jalapeno, liqueur, lime and mango and the Colorado Seduction, bourbon, spiced pear liqueur and lemons; both pretty solid drinks. However, I wasn't a big fan of the food here.  I just felt like it was out of the package and thrown in the fryer or grill.  We ordered the broccoli, fried dumplings, and mussels.  I appreciated the broccoli for having that charred flavor and the cheese atop.  The fried dumplings were pretty basic and layed on some sweet and sour sauce.  The mussels were probably my favorite; it had a sweet and comforting broth.  In the end, I think Holy Spirits would be great for drinks and fun, but food needs to improve. - Enjoy!

Oh So good!  This place reminds me a lot of The Yard since it was the first place I know that had the backyard games concept down.  Not a bad idea to share needless to say about the idea.  I rather enjoy coming to this particular OHSO because of it and I love the dogs!  I don't own one myself, but I come here to enjoy everyone else.  I would say OHSO is probably the best dog bar in town and plus they have 3 locations!  Maybe more to come!    With seasonal craft brews always on tap and especially highlighting local breweries; what's not to love about this place!  For the several times I'm been here the staff has been really helpful and on top of things.  Drinks a flowing and foods a cooking; whether it's Brunch, Lunch, or Dinner time OHSO gots you covered.  Brunch specials are my favorite; so far I had the OHSO Classic and Steak & Egg Burrito for brunch.  I didn't care much for the burrito since it wasn't anything too special.  The Classic well is classic breakfast with potatoes, scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast!  Then again guess I'm not here for the food either - wink!  I had the Burger+Cheese for dinner once and that was a pretty solid burger!  I would say the soft bun and cheesy burger really made this burger perfect with a cold beer!  Overall, a OHSO deserves my love and I will continue to be a patron simply because the craft brew is awesome and the atmosphere is always so lively! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Frankie Goes To Hollywood - Relax)  Nan Zhou go try it When you want hand drawn noodles Nan Zhou go try it When you want to Yelp Nan Zhou go try it When you want to Yelp When you want to Yelp   Nan Zhou is a new world once you walk in to this place.  I came with a bunch of my buddies and needless to say I felt like the foreigner here.  My fellow Asian brothers were all over this place haha!  We sat and analyzed the menu; many familiar stuff from what I see, but many new indeed.  I shot for the Spicy Pig Ears and the Beef Noodle Soup, while my friends got the Seafood Noodle Soup, Singapore Noodles and some Calamari Skewers.  I didn't really care for the calamaris.  The pig ears had the consistency of a cold seaweed salad, but a lot chewier and had a major kick!  My noodle soup was perfect; hand drawn noodles in a warm beef broth littered with fresh basil and cilantros giving it an aromatic pop.  The beef itself was tender.  I had a bite of some of my friends noodles and for me it seems the noodles here were well drawn and cooked.   Overall, Nan Zhou is a nice little noodle spot and in a perfect location across from Mekong.  Classic Chinese noodle meals cooked to perfection and the service to back it up.  Food here comes on the fly!  I ordered and bang my meal was at the table within minutes! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Soundgarden - Black Hole Sun)  In my mouth, I will eat In disguises oh you know Hides Yard Bird & The Larder The Walrus & The Pearl Boiling meat, summer drinks Eat the Bao at the Dragon's lair Call my name through the bar And I'll hear you scream again  DeSoto Won't you come And Yelp away the place DeSoto Won't you come Won't you come (Won't you come)    DeSoto is literally a food court, but with hip and funk.  The really enjoyed the concept since it reminds me of a coffee joint, but with with a full bar and food to serve.  I came on a Sunday afternoon and they had little local vendors selling their crafts.  I didn't buy any, but always enjoy local businesses supporting each other.  My buddy and I decided to do our best to try as much as possible.  Out of the 5 restaurants we settled to order from Walrus & The Pearl, Yard Bird & The Larder, and Adobe Dragon.  We just ordered a dozen oysters from the Walrus & The Pearl, which came with 5 different sauces.  My favorite was the sauce that had a ginger vinegar taste; red in color.  The oysters were pretty darn good and fresh as can be.  Next we ordered the Pork Belly bowl from Yard Bird.  It was roasted and doused with a Granny Smith Apple sauce and layered with a pecan crust.  Overall, salty and sour with a perfect crunchy bite.  Probably my favorite of the day.  The next meal came from Adobe Dragon and we ordered the Beef Bao.  It was pretty much Bulgogi beef with slaw stuffed in a doughy bun.  I didn't really care for it since the sauce and everything became mushy after sitting in the sauce for a while.  Needed some texture and also I thought it was over salty.    In the end, I really enjoyed hanging out at DeSoto Market and the food there can be better, but so much more to try.  A happy hour date with friends to this place is a definite must! - Enjoy!

The Elite Events in which I'm eating are the best I've ever had I find it fun to tell you I find it fun to eat When people making salads it's a very very  MAD Greens MAD Greens MAD Greens MAD Greens   I loves me a good salad and MAD Greens does it right!  To start all the MAD Greens I've been to have been welcoming and the process is generally painless.  Order your salad and add extra toppings if you want.  I always go with the Siam I Am salad; the kale and romaine combo combined with edamame, quinoa, peanuts, and organic chicken is what makes this salad for me!  I need a little crunch to my salads and the quinoa provides and extra protein punch.  Add some MAD Greens spice and you'll get that extra kick and flavor.  I sometimes order their Maine soda which totally rocks since it's sugar free and the flavors of each are just as addicting!   Overall, MAD Greens is a fast and growing company because of the service and the love they have for their ingredients.  House made dressing and fresh products always wins my love! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Gotye - Somebody That I Used To Know)  But I know I didn't have to sing a song Rock out like I always Yelping and like it was nothing And I really need your love But you fed me like a mother and that feels like love  No I didn't have a drink to start Have some coffee before I sit and then think of my review I guess that I don't need that though At a place they all call Ocotillo  At a place they all call Ocotillo At a place they all call Ocotillo   I was somewhat confused when I first visited Ocotillo.  It's layout somewhat reminds me of a compound of some sort; there was mess hall, coffee shop and a outdoor patio!  It's definitely different from your average restaurant visit, which you can take however you wish.  I came here for a Saturday brunch and sat at the bar so I can get a view of the place.  I had to order my coffee at the shop first before I sat.  My friend and I always order to share so we went with the Iron Skillet Pancakes, Breakfast Chimichangas, Black Kale Salad, and side of Hash Browns.  The pancakes came with a berry compote on top and served with butter and syrup. I didn't think it was anything too special.  Our chimichangas was breakfast style with eggs, chicken, broccoli, cheese, on top of a green chili sauce.  I would say it would have been everything that I would made my omelette with, but in a burrito style.  My favorite was probably the side of hash brown.  Crispy on the outside with a hint of cheesy creamy taste.  Not sure what they put in it, but was definitely worth ordering.  Finally, the salad was my other favorite of the day.  Served with pomegranate, almonds, parmesan cheese, and persimmons, which was totally uncommon place to find in a salad I thought, but it worked!    Overall, Ocotillo was totally refreshing and hip spot for your dining experience.  The layout is totally weird for me and the service here was friendly and kept a good conversation.  The food is playful and fun thus making this spot a must for all foodies! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Weezer - Hash Pipe)  I can't help my hunger, I'll go out of my mind This kitchens got it going cause I like their breakfast I can't love my singing if I can't get a drink Down some Bloody Mary's at a bar that I make  Ohhh, come on and make me Ohhh, come on and make me Whoa...! Come on and make me Whoa...! You've got some olives Whoa...! I want some peppers Whoa...! You've got some big pours Right at the Hash Kitchen   A former seafood restaurant The Hash Kitchen is now a head on Breakfast/Brunch restaurant with some fun flares!  I came here after a hike; my friend had her pup so we requested to be sat outside on the patio.  Needless to say, they were happy to oblige....yah!  As we walked pass the restaurant the place was hoping; I'm not sure if it was because of the PHX Open, but there were a lot of patrons along with a live DJ.  One thing noticeable about this place is the round Bloody Mary Table -- it's a MIY Bloody Mary bar!    To start I ordered the French Press coffee with the Smoked Sliced Brisket & Corn Beef Hash.  Of course I had to do the Bloody Mary bar!  I selected the Siracha Bloody Mary with Vodka; stuffing it with celery, baby corn, carrots, peppercini peppers, jalapenos, olives, bacon, and beef jerky.  I couldn't stuff it anymore at some point cause I would have!  Needless to say, it was fun and yum at the same time.  Moreover, I got the entire canister of the French Press coffee!  My hash came with green peppers and a poached egg on top.  I thought it was pretty basic, but still good.  I wanted some texture hoping the hash would be somewhat crunchy.    In the end, I gave this place my best because the ambiance was popping and the service was impeccable!  The place catered to my friends pup and our server kept coming out to serve him water too!  We were constantly asked if we need more of this or that and our waters kept full!  We had one main server, but managers and bussers came to our attention without a hitch.  Definitely my new favorite spot for breakfast! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Jennifer Paige - It's Just A Little Crush)  I see ya cookin' me a pizza It doesn't take a scientist To understand what's going on BoBites  If you see something at the bar Let's not over analyze Don't go too deep with it BoBites So let's eat what we'll eat Don't make a fuss and let's get crazy over food and drinks  Here's what I'll do We'll order booze Because we have a date at The Ostrich  It's just we're at the Crust (Crust) We like to eat every time we meet It's just (aah) some little thing (Crust) Cause everything I eat depends on this review Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la    Crust is a local pizzeria with 3 different locations throughout the valley.  Tonight I attended this local eatery at the Chandler location; funny cause I live down the street from the Scottsdale location.    I really like the look of the restaurant minus the pillars which as my friend pointed out; not very Feng Shui.  However, the place was popping with a full bar and large dining room.  We started out with a couple of drinks and the Bruschetta board a 4 for 10 meal; Classic Tomato, Goat Cheese & Roasted Garlic, Italian Antipasto, & Apple & Figs.  All was well but my favorite bite of the night was definitely the Italian Antipasto with Candied Lemon!  Great salty bite with a refreshing sour caramelized taste from the lemons giving this bruschetta some pop and definitely some love to my palates! For our pizza we went for a basic pepperoni pizza.  It was large for sure since they only served half of it first and then half later!  It's a thin crust east coast style pizza; cooked in fire oven.  The sauce was okay, but the thin and crispy crust and doughy ends really made this pizza a good eats.    Afterwards, as the night starts to begin you'll notice the crowd starting to dissipate.  That's cause every ones heading downstairs to The Ostrich; a basement cocktail lounge right outside the building.  With historical and haunting significant; this place definitely has an alluring feel and must go for all patrons just to experience! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Psy - Gangnam Style)  Oppan Gangnam Sushi Gangnam Sushi Op op op op oppan Gangnam Sushi Gangnam Sushi  Op op op op oppan Gangnam Sushi Eh......Sushi & Grill Op op op op oppan Gangnam Sushi Eh......Sushi & Grill Op Op Op Op Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh   Okay, with a name like that what song did you expect me to make a parody with......?  I was a skeptic about this place, but being a New & Hot spot on my Yelp app....why not!?  The place is not in the best location for a restaurant in my opinion.  I came here with a birthday dinner party.  Service wise I think they could improve; slow and inexperience.  I gather it's a new place and still might be getting it's kinks together however that's not an excuse I can forgive.    For our food we ordered the mackerel fish, Tiger & Spicy Tuna sushi, and the Bibimbap with Bulgogi.  The mackerel was cooked just right!  Salty to the bite and still retaining it's moisture; probably my favorite of the night!  Our Bibimbap was good, but I thought it was lacking in Bulgogi beef; probably another ounce or 2 of beef would have been welcoming.  I'm not a sushi snob but overall I thought the sushi was well plated and tasty.  I always enjoy a spicy and crunchy roll with some exotic ingredients.  Thus, we ordered the Tiger roll that included the Spider Crabs.  In the end, the 2 of us were pretty full and couldn't finish our meals.  Overall, I thought the food very good and finish what I could.  Not a lot of drink specials, but no complaints.  However, I was surprised at the price they were charging for some items which I could have ordered at other places for probably $1-$3 cheaper. - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Lady Gaga - Paparazzi)  We are the crowd We're Yelping out Got my star on it's true Need that picture of food It's so magical We'd be so fantastical  Sushi and drinks Sake Daiginjo Not sure what it means But this photo from us It don't have a price Ready for those sashimi Cause you know that baby I  I'm your biggest fan I'll Bo Bites you until you love me Sushi-Sushiholic Baby theres only four to five superstars That I can give you Sushi-Sushiholic   Sushiholic is the same owner as Sushi Style up on the North side of town.  Overall, I like the layout and ambiance of the place.  Hip and modern with beating music as you can hear the crowd chit and chatter!  I came here with my friend and we sat at the bar.  We ordered a bottle of sake to start our night.  For our appetizers we ordered the Okra & Potato wrapped Shrimp.  The okra was doused with a gooey sesame seed oil and nutty sauce.  It was light and didn't have the texture I expected.  It was similar to eating the stinky beans.  As for the shrimp; it was crunchy   since it was fried with the potato wrappings.  We just dipped those in sweet and sour sauce.  For our entree we ordered the First Love Roll, Cherry Blossom Roll, and the Salmon Nigiri with Kiwi.  The First Love was a California Roll topped with Tuna & Salmon and drizzled with eel sauce, spicy mayo, and creamy wasabi.  The Cherry Blossom was a double roll; salmon and avocado wrapped with tuna and eel sauce.  My favorite bite of the night was the salmon nigiri served with kiwi in a ponzu like sauce.  It was served in a large eating spoon so the appearance was very welcoming.    In the end, Sushiholic is a nice sushi spot for the Arcadia area.  The place was popping when we arrived and service was attentive and fun.  My recommendation is approved! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Nitty Gritty Dirt Band - Fishin In The Dark)  Cocktails serving brews coming up tonight,  Juleps at the bar Chickens are frying and pork bellies are floating in the breeze  Bo Bites get ready.....  Across the room where the cook turns plates with the old stone grill I'm gonna go to a special place that everyone should know  Bo Bites get ready....OoooooOooo  Yelp and me going to Okra Cookhouse Singing our tunes and drinking at the bar Where the bourbon flows  Down by Phoenix at The Crown on 7th We'll be dining Southern eats in the evening lights Just grooving slow....   Okra is a family friend of Crudos apparently -- wink!  I came here with a friend and at first we were both kind of lost since there was still construction going on.  However, once we found the entrance we were relieve to find a cute comforting restaurant!  We sat at the high top tables next to the bar since we wanted a view.  We started off with some cocktails since you can't turn down an award winning mixologist in the house!  I went for the Spirit Animal; tequila, sherry, lime, apple and pear bitters.  Overall, a solid drink to wet my palates for what's to come.  My partner ordered the Pina Tail on the Donkey; Appleton rum, Bacardi, smith & cross rum, mint and pineapple syrup.  Needless to say, it was a strong drink, beautifully poured, fun to look at, and fun to drink!  For our food we shot for the Hush Puppies to start and for the entree we ordered the Smoked Pork Osso Bucco and Catfish.  We both totally dig the hush puppies; soft within and crunchy cover while the goat cheese gave it a hint of creamy sweetness.  The pickled salad provided a sour punch.  My smoked pork came in an impressive style presentation; pretty much felt like I was going to eat a brontosaurus leg (yab-da-ba do!).  The meat was super tender and fell off the bone while the greens and black eye peas below which provided some extra flavors of sourness to the subtle meaty entree.  My partner's catfish dish was baked and came on a bed of okra succotashed gremolata.  She said it was good but was lacking in spice and flavors.  Overall, we love the originally of the food, but the lack flavors in certain aspects.  Drink selections was good and service was phenomenal! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Mr Presidents - Coco Jumbo)  Ramens up, Ramens down Have some sake for a round Feed me well, feel my heart And make me happy  Here we go getting food to some groove Trying Ramen Noodles, how I sing as I eat Cause that's what Bo Bites say, but I can improve So turn it up again and watch me Yelp to the food  As we get close, you whisper coco I hold you in my arms and you say, Jam Bo! Scream and shout, turn and try Tampopo Now you gotta go to Tampopo   Keeping it real, this is probably the closet solid Ramen joint in town for now!  I came here on a cold winter day.  The place is somewhat tiny so don't be surprised, but what I love about it is the bar top tables as you watch the chef cook and make your meal.  The community table is always a plus in my book!  I went for the Tonkotsu Ramen with some fish roe and a side of Octopus and Wasabi.  I also ordered a bottle of sake; cause what's Japanese food without sake!?  Overall, the octopus was what I'd expected it to be.  Slimy and with a bubbly pop and a hint of stinging wasabi.  The star of the night had to be the hand made Ramen noodles with the chewy and fatty pork, while the mushroom and egg helped mellow out the strong broth.  The roe I added helped gave it a salty taste.    In the end, Tampopo Ramen has won my heart as the next hot spot for Ramen!  Until the next challenger comes along, guess you can catch me at Tampopo! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Madonna - Illuminati)  It's not Cibo & Biancos It's not Barro's or Fired Pie It's not Pomo & LGO The Parlor & Oreganos Federal Pizza or Base  It's not Spinato's or MOD It's not Dominos or Pizza Hut Grimaldi's or Papas Forno or People's Serving on the pizza plate  The All-Yelping Bo is tasting tonight That's what it is Write and the song The All-Yelping Bo is tasting tonight Nothing to hide The secret's inside  It's like everybody in this city's eating at Lou Malnati's It's like everybody in this city's eating at Lou Malnati's    So what's the rave about this place!?  Well as I entered this restaurant the place was popping! We had to wait for about 30 minutes since I came with a friend.  The layout was really opened I thought with a large patio and the center bar connecting it to the "waiting room"; since there was a main dining room to the North.    We decided to start with a bottle of wine as we sat; which I had to educate the server how to uncork, but also explained how to pour.  No big whoops!  We proceeded to order the Malnati Salad to start and the The Malnati Chicago Classic for our entree.  The salad came with romaine, tomatoes, black olives, mushrooms, salami, romano and gorgonzola cheese and tossed with a sweet vinaigrette.  Overall, a good start to our dinner since it wasn't too heavy, but also I would say very basic salad.  I would have loved an element of crunch like caramelized walnuts or some seeds.  Our Malnati's pizza came with sausage, some extra cheese and tomato sauce on a buttercrust.  The mozzarella cheese was definitely stringy and cheesy to the bite and the sausage was salty and chewy as expected.  What really popped for me was the tomato sauce, which they claim is vine-ripened tomatoes, but it had an aromatic punch with a slight hint of marinara taste.  The crust was different since it reminded me of biting into a cookie, but a different taste of course.  However, I would attribute this texture that is so alluring about Lou Malnati's pizza.  Somewhere in the psyche of our mind, I'm sure this bite triggers something in our heads that makes eating this Chicago style deep dish delectable! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Dexys Midnight Runners - Come On Eileen)  Order spicy pot Tasted good with the chilies It moved a million senses in style! Oh Bobites cried Sang along, who'd blame me  I ate (You ate up) So full (So full up) Now I must eat more than ever (Chengdu Delight)  Toora loora toora loo rye ay And we can sing just like Bo Bites does Chengdu Delight, oh I Yelp what I mean At this moment, you mean everything With garlic spinach, my thoughts I confess Mellow on Spicy! Ah Chengdu Delight!   At first sight from outside this place didn't seem to uplifting....especially next to a Little Caesars Pizza joint; I'm not judging here cause I'll eat the hell out of a Little Caesars pizza!  Once I walked in things got a little different.  I totally dig the water fountain bridge upfront and the grand piano in the main room.  Decors on the wall are sparse and could improve while the red lanterns is a must.  I hope the keep this up and make sure they dust!    My friends and I started with some Pork Pancakes and continued with ordering the Garlic Spinach, and Spicy Fish Filet.  I went for the Spicy Hot Pot.  The Pork Pancakes were okay; It reminded me of the soupy dumplings because the pork inside was like a soupy meat within a floury bun; but I still prefer soupy dumplings haha!  One of my favorites of the night was the Garlic Spinach, cooked to perfection with the right amount of sweet and saltiness to the crunch!  I only had one bite of the fish filet, but thought it well cooked again and loaded with some chilis made this dish a spicy pop; I think a tad too much.  My hot pot came with beef, chicken, shrimp and a load of bean sprouts.  Well presented and definitely could have served two people easily.  I think next time I would tone down the spice level since I ordered medium and my tongue was on fire!  The rice helped leveled it out.  Overall, service here was on top of things when I visited and was very helpful.  The place was aesthetically great to look at and in the end the food was cooked right to what you'd expect of Sichuan cuisine! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Ginuwine - Pony)  I'm just a Yelper Looking for some good eats Someplace who knows what to serve Without any compromise  Gotta be scrumptious Takes me to my limits Oh when I take a bite I promise that you'll want a Bo Bites song  If you're hungry, lets do it, taste it, my poke My palates waiting, make it with 3 scoops If you're hungry, lets do it, taste it, my poke My palates waiting, make it with 3 scoops   Poke bowl is a Japanese Hawaiian fusion dish where raw seafood is served atop a bed of rice or salad.  It is then topped with exotic ingredients such as daikon roots, edamame, and jicama.  Drizzled with their specially made house sauce that Ahipoki Bowl provides; make this a great one stop fresh pop in your mouth shop!  You have options of choosing between white rice, brown rice, or a salad base.  You can also do a combo of either of the 3.  For a large bowl you get 3 scoops of the raw protein.  I shot for the spicy tuna, salmon, and octopus topped with jicama, edamame, daikon roots, dried seaweed, and sesame seeds.  For the sauce I ordered their house spicy sauce.    Overall, a solid bite of texture, but you definitely needed to add those specific toppings I added to make it work.  As for the rice it was a tad bit dry but my salad help give it some moisture along with the spicy sauce which was very welcoming since it brought out the flavors and meshing well with the raw proteins.  The popularity of made to order meals where your ingredients are being stacked in your bowl is definitely something that gives you a feel that you're eating something healthy.  Customizing your meals is cool, but I'm generally a guy that likes what the chef think is best; granted its not to say I don't appreciate this place.  In the end, it was fun and I can't wait to play with my food as I plan to continue to come back! - Enjoy!

(Lyrics - Far East Movement - Like A G6)  Elite Events in the East, love a Yelper When we drink we do it right get a Spice Trader Sipping cocktails at the bar, love free drinks  Now I'm feasting far east like a Yel-per Like a Yel-per, Like a Yel-per Now-Now I'm feasting far east like a Yel-per Like a Yel-per, Like a Yel-per Now-Now I'm feasting far east like a Yel-per  Gimme that No-Noodles Gimme that Ch-Chicken Ladies love my Yelp style, at my table getting wild Get them dishes serving, we get that sweet and that spice Now-Now give me 2 more dishes cause you know it family style  Hailey! Eat it up, eat-eat it up When Yelp Elites around me, they be writing what they want They be writing what they want, writing-writing what they want When Yelp Elites around me, they be writing what they want   I like how this place is on the East part of Phoenix cause otherwise it wouldn't make sense.  However, do you know what does makes sense?  Ah Yelp Elite partying at Inchin's Bamboo Garden!  Another night of food, drinks, and fun with the Yelp gang.  Yeah we're that cheesy Broadway gang (When you're a Jet, you're a Jet, you're a Jet....).  Yes that kind, indeed.    Needless to say, were greeted by the lovely Ms. Hailey and welcomed with open arms ... and drink specials made with house juice; Rum with Blackberries or Bourbon with lemon juice, jalapenos and peach schnapps.  Me being spicy drinker totally dig the Spice Trader as they called it.    Family style meals as it should be since we are a family of Yelp starting with Crispy Chili Baby Corn, Kuchow Chicken, and Shrimp Pepper Salt.  Then with the entrees the Chicken Manchurian Dry, Yellow Thai Curry, Fish Hot Garlic, Fried Rice and Noodles.  Finally finishing if off with dessert; the Darsaan with Ice Cream.  Overall, favorites of the night for me was the Kuchow Chicken and the Thai Curry; especially when you add it to the fried rice and noodles!    In the end, a lovely night with the Yelp Elites and Hailey while getting great service from Inchin's Bamboo Garden staff members! - Enjoy!
