The food is amazing and healthy! Love the Portabella Mushroom burger, it is top-notch and has such great flavors. Be sure to start out with the Roasted Red Pepper Humus, you won't regret it!

I dont even know why I order anything from here. They never get my rather simple orders right, not once! The food is good but you know what would be better? Getting what I paid for.

It blows my mind that other Yelper's who give such low reviews, of course you're gonna wait, and they seem to never have a problem with my fade when I get my haircut every two weeks. These guys know what they're doing, and it's evident in the constant flow of business I see coming into the barbershop every time I go.  Mike (Mikhail) is the only person I will even allow to cut my hair. Period. From the first day I went there I didn't even need to tell him how I wanted it done, he could tell and did it to perfection and continues to every single time. The man is truly the best at what he does.  From the straight razor neck trims, to the hot towels and an old school shoulder massage, for SIXTEEN dollars is pretty damn insane.   My brothers, father and even my younger nephew go here and have since it's doors have opened. Check em' out, it's a great vintage barbershop!   Heads up, they're closed Sundays.

This place is amazing. I'm a frequent Total & More visitor, always walking up and down the aisles, picking up and putting down 6-packs in search for a favorite to enjoy that evening, or pondering what the new brew will taste like.   The prices are unbeatable and by far beat out those of BevMo and the surrounding grocery stores.   Nice staff too!
