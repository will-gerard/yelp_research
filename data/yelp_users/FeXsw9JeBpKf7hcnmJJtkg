Great guy, he does what's needed and does it well.  Small office with a counter gal/assistant named Karen who does the xrays, but the Dr. has always done all my cleanings himself.

There's a reason they've been around since 1912!  I just purchased my third bike from the North Scottsdale (PV) Landis location.  The staff is phenomenal down to earth and all around great people, you won't find bike snobs like other local dealers.  They do not work on commission so they work to help you find your perfect bike be it $300 or $3000.  They stock plenty of accessories and parts.  The mechanics are top notch and are eager to help you learn to do your own basic stuff.

Nothing but the best here!  Alex is truly a master of the craft.  Treat yourself to a nice straight razor shave sometime no greater feeling.

Decent buffet I think it was $10 at lunch when we went.  They had a decent selection of hot foot and sushi type rolls. I'd go back for sure!

Crazy round the block lines to get in glad I had paper tickets, will call was a joke.  The VIP section is so far away from the stage its laughable!  Bars are SLOW and overpriced the bathrooms are like going on a ghost hunters adventure to find.  ITS HOT AS HELL INSIDE like birkim yoga hot.. UGH and the allow glass beer bottles on the floor to get dropped and broken in a sea of people...  This place needs mad help.

Went to do the lazy river $6 a person seemed like a fair price thou they were only open for four hours.  The lifeguards had a drill where the demanded everyone out of the water no matter where they were, we happened to be in the middle of the lazy river "OUT NOW! LEAVE YOUR RAFT GET OUT!" They wouldn't allow my wife to get to a ladder the exit we had to climb out on to the blazing hot concrete and burn our feet for about 50 yards back to our flip flops! Piss poor setup even our apartment pool has a surface around thr pool thats doesn't burn your feet.  First and last time ....

The Bobbie is to die for I could eat it everyday!  The manager gave us a great deal on our holiday tray because he recognized my name from Facebook!

Service was OK ... food was meh ... price was OMG! This place won't last long.  Started by ordering a Smithwicks (on all the menus) oh sorry we don't have that anymore. Good I really didn't want to pay $6 for a beer.  Had the honey mustard wings to start they where just so so the blue chesse dressing was nice and chunky that was a plus.  My hangover burger was nothing special I've had better burgers at Denny's.  Over all it was just a disappointment I don't think it will get a second chance.

Great service, had the dinner buffet @ $19.99 a person we asked if we could see the buffet first "No problem, have a look!" I looked at my wife for her approval and we decided to try it. Nice selection of sushi, soups, traditional Chinese dishes. They had  snow crab legs and prime rib also. Great dessert choices with several ice creams and cheese cakes etc.

No matter if your a beginner trying to quit smoking or a pro cloud chaser, this is the spot.  Luis and Sam will help you from you very first e-cig setup to the most powerful custom mod.  Great service from when you walk in the door Luis will run up and shake your hand and welcome you to his "home". This place was created with community in mind there are several couches to sit and relax on and a full service juice bar to sample the tons of flavors he carries. I personally am a big internet shopper but have changed my thinking a lot now that I've been to this store several times yes I can buy a tank online for 3 dollars less I can also wait and stalk the mailman wondering what snow storm back east held my package up.  Buying local keeps more money in Arizona and this is local business I'd love to see do well.  So stop in and enjoy your new addiction VAPE ON!!!!
