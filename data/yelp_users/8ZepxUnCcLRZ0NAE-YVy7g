Okay so they pulled through in the clutch. My parents and reviews said that they were great and better yet they were rather cheap. They advertise on their window that if you check-in at 9am you will have clothes ready by 4pm the next day. I had an important job interview at 1pm, they had it ready for me at 10am the following day! They are amazing and they provide a great service!

Cue Club isn't what it is all hyped up to be. I have no clue why it's as popular as it is... No one even plays pool in the back. It's completely over crowded and super annoying if you are going out with a large group of people. Other than that... Their drinks are  good for a decent price. Long islands are pretty toxic as well as electric lemonade, but if you are dragged their by your friends then I always tell people to get the liquid marijuana Its offered as a shot, but it's better as a drink.

WOW the reviews were not lying! I just killed their breakfast burrito. Honestly I think its the best I have ever had! Also I paid $4 bucks for this amazing burrito.

Nothing different from a gourmet sandwich shop but pretty good all together.

If you like a juicy sub and you don't mind onions... Ask for your sub to be made Mike's way! It's excellent.

I've always wanted to try glass blowing. I wasn't sure about this place when we got here, but when we walked in everything was better. They had a bunch of cool examples all over the room. The instructors were fun and like to have a good time. Obviously when you go to class about blowing glass you can only imagine. My wife and I will be back for some more blowing!

I would like to start by saying I'm not from Chicago or any other place known for their phenomenal cheese, but who doesn't love them some cheese! Especially if its deep fried right? I've been to quite a bit of bars around town and I'm pretty sure everyone has their version of cheese curds. Its kind of like pizza, you can't really screw it up too bad. This goes without saying the cheese curds at this place is hands down the best I've ever had! I literally I go to just eat their curds. Plus they've got a great selection of beer. I mean beer and cheese curds how much better can it really get?
