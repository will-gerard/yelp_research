I wish I would have tried this place sooner!  My husband had only tried it once while working downtown and had never mentioned it to me.  That was until, I was sick of the usual and suggested we stop downtown on the way to Chandler.    I ordered a regular Cheese Steak with onions (banana peppers on the side).  It was incredibly juicy, flavorful, and beyond delicious!  I scarfed it down and wanted more.  In fact, a week later, I went back for another b/c I could not stop thinking about how good it really was.  But this time, we went during lunch hour on a weekday and it was so busy that I didn't get as much meat...so it wasn't as good as the first time.  I will be back though, just not on a busy weekday.  I loved that they also sold east coast desserts (TastyCakes, which I had never had and liked) and chips.  The service was very good, on my first visit and even during lunch hour.

My friend took me here for lunch last week and I quite enjoyed my gyro pita with greek fries.  It was derishious!  I've thankfully had the real deal when we were in Athens years and years ago and this was fairly close.  I do wish the gyro had a tiny bit more Tzatziki though.  The greek fries (or they might have been a slightly different take on their specials menu) had feta cheese, which is my absolutel favorite next to parmesan, lemon squeezed over it, and oregano.  Mmmm mmmm goooooood!!    The service was speedy and they were accommodating despite it being during the busy lunch rush on a weekday.

Ugh!  I'm a huge Thai fan and this place was completely icky.  What I love about Thai food is that it is flavorful.    I ordered my usual that I get from every Thai restaurant I go to...just see my Yelp profile.  Their pad won sen was flavorless and had some of the weirdest ingredients.  I didn't want to finish it or take it home because it was so lackluster.  My friend ordered their garlic chicken which was just okay.  The amount of garlic they put in it should have been shared with my dish.  Yikes!  It was merely a place we chose randomly and I don't ever want to eat there again.  There are too many tasty Thai places in the valley to waste my time here again.

There isn't much more I can say that everyone else already has.  But I am happy that the west side has such a great sushi restaurant, b/c I am tired of driving all the way out to Scottsdale for the right sushi.    A friend and I shared the Spicy Tuna Rolls and the Fiesta Salmon Roll.  Both were delicious and just the right amount of spicy.  We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef recommended we order the Fiesta Salmon Roll, especially if we liked spicy sushi.  He was right...it was very good, but definitely more spicy than the regular ol' spicy tuna roll, and it was very colorful!    Just like others have already posted, it is in a very non-sushi type location stuck next to a Payless Shoe Source.  Don't be fooled by the exterior.  We went on a Monday afternoon during lunch and there was a steady wave of people coming in and out...always a great sign!

One may wonder why in the heck I'm giving a dive bar 5 stars. Well...that's my point.  It's a dive bar but that's mostly just it's outer core it's facade!  Been driving by this place for years and always wanted to venture inside to see what a place that has a huge rooster out front, with an M&M on the roof, and a Captain Morgan pirate striking its pose on the front porch. The parking lot is always packed. Something has GOT to be good about this place right?! Plus, the sign out front stating they have the most World's Famous Chili got me wondering too.  We recently moved closer to it and on our first night living in our new place, we realized it was Friday Fish Fry Night. I must admit, I was a bit nervous to step inside wondering what type of folk were awaiting us. At first we couldn't find the entrance...was it door #1, door #2, or door #3? Hmmmmm. I'll let you go on the same adventure I did and figure that out for yourself.  Yes there are the type of people that you always see in a dive bar present in Roman's. And yes, the decor is divey.  But one must overlook that because their fish fry is the BEST I've had in the valley. It will run you about $9, but you get 3 really nice sized cod fillets breaded and fried to a perfect crisp.  Not soggy. Not dried out. Perfectly cooked and tasty. It comes with coleslaw which I think is pretty decent for a dive bar...could use a little more celery see or even dill. The fries are decent as well, not bad, again, for a dive bar. They also give 2-3 hushpuppies, which I've never had included with a fish fry before. I really don't like hushpuppies at all...but the seasoning they add to their version is PERFECT! And just like the fish, they are cooked just right.   We've been back one other time since and it was just as good. We plan to continue going back and bringing any of our friends and family members that visit too.

An ice oasis in a place where there should be double or triple the amount of ice rinks, Polar Ice brought me back to my childhood.  It was the first time I had skated since I was in my early teens.  There are 2 rinks and plenty of lockers.  But getting our tickets in and then our skates was a bit of pain due to some weird set-up on their part.  Once we got past the 30 minute wait altogether, I had tons of fun.  I just wish it was closer.

I have ate at some pretty delicious Thai restaurants around town including Thai Hut and Swaddee Thai, so I do know what tasty and flavorful Thai yumminess is like.  We went here after another restaurant had a huge wait and one of my friends picked this as a nearby stand-in that he had ate at.    The interior of Thai Rama is not so attractive and I tried to look past that.  But the food couldn't save it.  Even the sauce you dip your eggrolls in there has an incredily weird texture and taste.  I got some kind of beef dish with medium spice level.  It was so strange and distasteful that I can't remember what it was even called.  There's no way I will ever go back, even though my kind friend paid for my dinner.  Thai Hut is right down the street.  Save yourself some money and enjoy better Thai there.

An older version of Desert Willow, this one still has all the amenities and treats people well.  The staff is just as attentive and the food is always flowing.  Gotta love that when you are to do business all day long!  The bathrooms aren't exaclty my favorite as many of the doors' locks don't work anymore and they are a bit run down.  But a lot of this comes with being an older conference center.  As long as they keep providing the treats and great service...I don't mind it so much.

Tokyo is one of the first places I ate at when I first moved here.  It was right around the corner from the school I teach at, so it was our go-to place to grab lunch (before our lunch was shortened to 30 minutes).    Anyway...you could say I'm a regular.  Or maybe the fact they know my order as soon as I walk in would mean I'm a regular.  LOL.  I get the Teriyaki Chicken Lunch Special every single time I go.  It comes with the little salad and the tasty ginger/soy dressing and a drink.  Sure, this isn't the most spectacular food in the state, but it is just one of those places that I rely on when I am super hungry and know I can get a filling lunch or dinner.  There's something about it I can't pass up.    I have been to the one near downtown Phoenix and that one was yucky and the staff wasn't as friendly.  My bowl had crunchy half steamed rice, blech!

A friend and I went here last night to watch the special Q&A night performance of Love, Loss & What I Wore.  It was my first time ever coming to this theatre despite all the many, many, many times I've walked past it and admired it from the outside.  The Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts is a gorgeous venue.  The lobby it self is incredibly contemporary and modern looking with plenty of spots to sit and lounge before you head in to your show.  And the theatre itself is a very nice one with lots of wood panels and a great view of the stage, no matter where you sit.  I was actually sitting in the Yelp section, as they were the event's media sponsor.  Thanks for brining me along Mary!  Our row, along with 2 others, were the Tweet Seats, which means we were allowed to tweet during the performance using a special hash tag and their wifi password.  They asked us to post questions for the Q&A session after the performance.  It was pretty neat...especially since one of my questions was chosen!

I have never been to a show I didn't like!  Childsplay is the creme de la creme of children's theatre.  The actors are phenomenal and the bees knees at their craft.  Their costumes and sets hypnotize me and reel me in from the get go.  I love their Q&A sessions at the end of each play and the fact that they have a set of questions you can take home with you for the car ride back.    They use literature for the majority of their plays and have new shows every single year.    But what is even better is their traveling shows they send to schools around the valley and country.  If you are lucky enough to get a grant for them to come, you get shows that are just as good as those in the Tempe Performing Arts Center.  Their sets are smaller, but they have their amazing costumes, props, and music along with them.  They still do Q&A sessions after these traveling shows and give us teachers those same questions that they do at the TPAC shows.    It doesn't matter if you are an adult without kids...everyone should attend at least one Childsplay show in their lifetime.  You are missing out if you don't!

My 5th grade team and I brought our classes here for a free field trip.  Did I say free?  There were 150 of us and they were very accomodating...me?  I would have been freaked out to see that many kids walk in if I were them.  But they were kind, patient, and helpful.    We got to walk through the area where they were making white chocolate dipped pretzels, which is made using the same type of belt you see in the chocolate I Love Lucy episode.  Fun!  Each student (and adult) receives a free sample as well.  We couldn't afford to get the $10 chocolate pizza or the $3 candy wrapping package.  But many of the kids, teachers, and chapperones shopped in the candy shoppe and grabbed some tasty treats.  I bought a pound or so of various chocolates to pass out to my kids.  While I was only able to try a couple pieces, they were definitely well-made.    This is one of those nice local gems that everyone, locally grown here in Arizona or not, should visit at least once.  It is worth the trip or two.

Thanks to my bestie, I am hooked to death on their chicken strip basket that comes with a mini sundae of your choice!  In fact, just typing this is making me hanker for it.    This is the only DQ close by to my area unfortunately, but it is a big one and very nice.    I must say though, I have found that the younger kids working here seem to hate having t make the DQ trademark coil when they pump out your ice cream.  Not cool!  :-)

I have to admit, I had never wanted to step into one of these because of the name.  It made me think it was for older women and possibly the plus size variety.  But my mom was in town this week and she is neither and mentioned she had shopped there many times after I told her I need new dresses for work.    I'm an Ann Taylor Loft shopper and also love to shop at New York & Company for my more "fancier" work clothes.  But Ann Taylor is way out of my budget for things like dresses and so I hardly ever get to go.  I walked into Dress Barn completely enamored by the fact that they have the same type of styles as Ann Taylor but at prices that are much more affordable (ex:  dresses are typically $39.99 as compared to $79 or more at Ann Taylor).  I tried on about 6 different styles and loved 5 of them!    Luckily, Dress Barn does have sales and deals going on and that makes it even better.  I ended up buying a pair of heels there as well just because they were actually comfortable and I needed a pair.  I signed up for their club and already got a 20% coupon in my email inbox.  I'm excited to go back knowing that I can still get that Ann Taylor look for less.  :)  The service I received was also great and I felt good about my purchases.

A bunch of friends and I tried this place for my husband's birthday the other day after I found it here on Yelp.  For the love of everything tasty, this place was the BEST barbeque place I have ever been to (aside from a place I loved that went out of business in San Diego).  After reading all the reviews about the appetizers and entrees, I pretty much already knew what I wanted to order before even sitting down at our table.    Our waiter, Lorenzo, couldn't have been better with his service and sense of humor.  The feel of the interior was a mix of casual and modern yet not too overly countryfied...there weren't dead animals hanging on the walls staring at me as I ate or hides either.  The group of us ordered the Onion Block for our appetizer.  I am not an onion person, but am a fan of the Bloomin' Onion at Outback.  But I can tell you right here and now that the Onion Block at BobbyQ's was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G-L-Y delicious!  It had the perfect crispy consistency, but what made it was the BBQ ketchup that it comes with.  I could have ate the sauce by itself.  The 6 of us ravaged it.    For our entree, my husband and I went for one of the winning combinations, particularly the BBQ chicken and prime rib.  We decided on the ranch beans and the Mac & Cheese (after the reviews) for our sides.  I went to ask for an order of corn bread (3 for $1.50) but Lorenzo told me that he would bring us a basket for all of us.  So, I am not sure if that is something that is included, kind of like chips and salsa at Mexican food joints.    The chicken was absolutely juicy and had the perfect amount of sauce and the prime rib was also juicy and melted in my mouth (we ordered it cooked Medium).  First, the Mac & Cheese was so very creamy and tasty that I had to stop myself from eating that and get back to the meat.  But the ranch beans tasted like so many others I have tasted, not bad though.  My friends and I, who also ordered the M&C, noticed a hint of jalapeno (not spicy, just the taste).  We asked Lorenzo and he told us they have two types of melted cheese in the kitchen, one being the cheese they usually use for the M&C and then this pepper jack/jalapeno cheese they use for other dishes.  He had said they must have accidentally used the wrong one and that it hadn't been the first time it happened.  This was so not a problem, b/c that jalapeno taste was actually what made it, I think.  I'll have to request it next time.    The desserts didn't impress me much, but I knew from the reviews, we'd be getting free donuts before we left.  I loved that touch!  Mark my words, we will be going back more than once.  I'm sure we will take our in-laws and my family to give them the chance to taste BobbyQ's deliciousness!!!!!

Sadly, I did not find this place to be as tasty as I hoped or for the prices either.    However, I thought it was going to be uber good because of menu choices and descriptions...and the prices.  But prices lie sometimes...or a lot!  Oh and perhaps because their pesto butter that they give with their bread basket was yuuuuuuuuuumy!    We went for a friend's birthday dinner and so we shared the fried mozarella balls with anchovy sauce and capers.  Now that was tasty!    I got the filet mignon ravioli with veal demi sauce, aromatic vegetables, truffle, and parmaggiano.  Sigh.  The raviolis were good, but I was expecting parmaggiano melted on top and more of a taste variety.  The first few bites were tasty, but I quickly became bored with it.  I did nosh on my friend's seafood ravioli (which were pretty good since it had a cream sauce) and a bit of another friend's veal.  I've had mouth-watering melt-in-your-mouth veal in Sorrento, Italy...so that is what I was hoping for and expecting.  Not so much. See my attached photo...there certainly isn't much to it, very 2-dimensional.    This one was a definitely let down for sure.  And for the pricetag, I'm not happy to not have enjoyed it more.  There seems to be a very old crowd here as well.    Our server was very friendly and helpful as well.  I was afraid not to finish off my last ravioli though, even though I was full, because he would give us a hard time if we didn't finish things on our plate.  Gotta love Europeans!  I remember that happening often when I traveled all over Europe awhile back.  LOL

Okay, so it is an Italian restaurant, but all three of us who went together had Philly steak sandwiches!  I know, I know...that seems a little weird.  But my friend had highly recommended them and I'm a sucker for a good one.  It was definitely worth it.  Even though it was not cheesy enough for my tastes, the steak was juicy and perfectly cooked (I didn't have to chew on it too much) and the toppings made for a great combination.    I loved the garlic bread that they brought to us as a complimentary appetizer too...yum!    I'd love to go back and try some of their pasta dishes or even the pizza.  They had a really nice variety but not so much that you struggle to choose from their menu.     The owner or possibly the manager came out and started playing his accordion for one of the tables at one point near the end of our meal.  I highly dislike accordions (you know, that whole polka scene).  But he was amazing on it and had a wonderful singing voice!  I wish he had come out earlier so I could have heard more before we left.

I don't care if anyone else gives this less than 5 stars because I freakin' love it!  Their Asian Zing boneless wings are what my Happy Hour dreams are made of.  They have great seasonal beers on tap throughout the year as well.  I'm a huge fan of their buffalo chips as well with chipotle dry seasoning...but ask for them well well well done, or they'll come out super soggy.  Mmmmmmmm.  I wish it wasn't so loud in there, but it is the best place to go for Happy Hour on Fridays.  Ask for Chris...he is my favorite waiter there by far.  Most of the them are great, but I have had to deal with one who came to our table once and then took way too long to come back and get our order or bring our food.  My other complaint, that won't stop me from coming, is their hostess stand.  You could stand there for hours with 2 hostesses right in front of you and not be acknowledged...not even a, "We'll be with you in a second."  Nothing.  Most of the time I just bypass them now and tell them I'm going to the bar and listen to them stammer as I leave them in my dust.

I had myself my first Cornish Pasty the other night!  My hubby and I picked them up, so this review is plain and simple...for the food.    I got the Spicy Asiago Chicken with spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes.  It was fantastic!  Still piping hot by the time we opened them up to devour them.    Definitely a fan and can't wait to come and dine in sometime soon.  There are quite a few pasties I'm eyeballing on their menu...I love all the choices!!

The library building itself is well worth 5-stars.  It is huge and well-lit with all of its huge windows.  I like that it has a ton of large tables and chairs where I can work.  For the most part the atmosphere is pretty quiet.    But they have a video came area where kids can sit on a couch and play.  The crazy thing is it is right in the back next to most of the studying tables.  Um hello?!  Worst place to put it ever!!  While they have a security guard who goes around telling people what to do...they are absent when they are seemingly needed the most.  I've seen the guard tell someone to stop sleeping at his table, even though he had only laid his head down for a moment after studying for a long time.  They even told us not to bring food in...understandable.  Yet, when you have the nearby high schoolers using the library as a gossip room where they laugh super loud and cuss up a storm, run in and out of the doors, etc, and no one is around telling them to keep it down or leave...then what is the point?!  Ugh.  I wish a library like this was closer to me because the amount of room and tables is perfect.  I just wish people talking on their cell phones loudly and teenagers using the library as their after school watering hold would learn to respect the fact that it's a library not a coffee shop.

I've been to Lenny's twice now after my husband raved about how much he had loved it when he worked downtown a few years ago.  Both times I have been, we went on a weekday in the evening.  They close down half of the shop, since lunchtime is their busiest.  It is across the street from my fav place, Best of Philly.  What a hard choice between the two, especially when my hubby loves Lenny's and I love Philly.    The first time I went I saw a picture of their Chili Cheese Fries in the window and knew I had to have them.  It took me forever to figure out what type of burger I wanted though, b/c they have combos that they have created and then a ton of different ways to create your own.  I decided on the Sourdough Burger and it was super tasty.  The sourdough is toasted and the burger is juicy.  Perfect!  As for the chili cheese fries...incredibly good!  I did try their regular fries on my second visit and the seasoning they put on them is really good too.    My husband just loves the Mexican Burger, which has green chile on it and pepper jack cheese.  He is obsessed with it and pretty much dreams about it, and both times I have been in I have heard people also ordering it.    The atmosphere is one of an old diner with a white tin roof and tiled counters.  One gripe I have is that they don't seem to keep it cool enough inside.  There are ceiling fans, but the sun blasts into the front windows and I end up sweating while I am eating.  It's uncomfortable, so that is what prevents me from giving them 5 stars.

I am no longer a Teavana tea drinker!  Souvia is what Teavana hopes to be for sure.  And it's local!    When I walked in, I was immediately greeted with way more tins of fresh loose leaf tea than that other place, ahem, could ever hope for.  The owner happened to be the one there when I came in on a weekday.  She was incredibly helpful, sweet, and informative.    I absolutely loved being able to smell the different teas I was interested in without having to rush, like at that other place.  She gave me recommendations based on the few teas that I had her pull out for me.    What's ever better about Souvia?  They have cafe tables and chairs with super relaxing spa-type music playing.  This is what I have always wanted about a tea place like Teavana.  Souvia also sells different types of tea wares like brewers, to-go mugs, and more...but at about half the cost of that other place.  Ahem.  They have a daily tea out for sampling as well as honey to sweeten it with.    I bought 50 g of Angel's Kiss (a popular tea the past 8 years they have been open), Pacific Rim, and Gluehwine as well as my own brewer.  There was actually a sale going on so I got the brewrer, 2 of the 50g teas, and 2 tins for $29.95.  Score!  When you spend $20, you also get to take a sample baggy of tea...you pick it out of a little basket Souvia keeps.    I can't wait to go back!!

All the reviews here are true!  TCA is gorgeous and worth the visit.  I have only ever gone in for Childsplay shows.  But I've been in both their smaller intimate theater and their larger theater.  Both have excellent sound capabilities, the chairs are comfortable, and I have enjoyed myself every time.  The architecture is a beauty to take in when you are inside and out.  It's worth coming in just to look around if you are in the area.  They have walking paths outside with one of the new pedestrian bridges.  Stop just looking at it from the freeway and come in for a show!  Don't expect to be chintzy in their little snack bar though.  Even the chips cost an arm and a leg!

Thai food is my latest obsession and I have been on the chase for the best for the past month and a half after eating at Swaddee's in Flagstaff (see my review for that one).  My friend Ayesha (also on Yelp), is a Thai food expert and she recommended this one over some of the others recommended by Yelp.    As a creature of habit, I love to order Pad Won Sen (glass noodles), wherever I go.  I am a sucker for a plate of really great and really tasty PWS.  While, the best to be had is definitely at Swaddee's, I would have to say that Thai Hut's Pad Won Sen is second best.  It has way more flavor than the PWS that I tried at Thai Orchid in Goodyear or 75 Thai in Maryvale.

Found inside and upstairs in the Plant Hollywood Casino, this place is quite honestly the best sushi I've had!  While their prices are up there (I mean come on, it's Vegas) it is seriously a really great place to go if you want some tasty and well done sushi.    I've been two times now, the first being about 3 years ago.  At the time, I was fairly new to sushi.  But I remember ordering their spicy tuna rolls and feeling like they were incredibly flavorful and well made.  I had since then been telling people it was my favorite ST roll by far.    Let me just say that when I usually feel like this about a restaurant and build it up in my head and then revisit after a couple years...that it usually isn't what I remember it to be.  But and this is a big BUT, the spicy tuna roll the 2nd time around was even better!  I could have scarfed them down in a short minute if I hadn't been trying to sample some of the other rolls we had ordered.  We also ordered the Crispy Rice (as per recommended here) which I thought was pretty fair and the Dragon Roll which is incredibly tasty!  I also absolutely love the atmosphere at Koi.  It is sexy and chic for sure!  Our waiter knew everything about the rolls and different dishes and was on point the entire night.

How have I never reviewed my favorite movie theater in the valley yet?!  My husband and I are ultra movie buffs and go to the movies often.  I despise AMC theaters out here, because I swear to you, their seats are super uncomfortable vs. Harkins (I have a bad back, so I'm a bit picky).  We don't like the UltraStar in Surprise because it is a bit cramped.    Not only is Harkins a local theatre...and I feel great about supporting it each time we go, but...stick with me here...they are the only theatre that has the popcorn flavor toppers!!  I never used to eat movie theatre popcorn and chose candy instead.  But there's no way I can go without getting popcorn so I can cover it with the white cheddar flavor...but I digress.  I'm supposed to be reviewing the Park West location.  We used to go to the Palm Pavilion theatre off of the 101 and McDowell, but it is OVERRUN by teenagers at all hours of the day (except maybe the first showing of the day).  The parking there is a bit of a pain in the rear.  So, we stumbled upon Park West when it first opened and never hesitate to go there first.  Even on opening night, the theater isn't as packed with teenagers and unruly kids.  We do tend to go on Saturday or Sunday mornings and still avoid evening shows.  The other day we went to the very first showing at 9:55 and it was glorious to have the parking lot and the theater almost all to ourselves!    I almost hate advertising these things I love about PW because I don't want too many people realizing it is so fantastic.  As long as the unruly teenagers and kids stay away, I'll be totally cool with that!

Sooooooooo much better than Jamba!!!  And that's saying something for me since I was coming of age when Jamba first came out on the scene and that was when people started to obsess over smoothies.    My hubby has gone here a ton and I finally grabbed one with him the other day.  He loves the South Pacific Squeeze and so I went with that for my first time.  Strawberries.  Pineapples.  Pineapple Sherbert.  Orange Juice.  Bananas.  Mmmm mmmm good.    All I have to say is...they are better than Jamba for the mere fact Robek's smoothies are way fruitier tasting, less icy (yet still smooth), and don't taste of yogurt.  They are way more refreshing as well.  I'm hooked!  I already went in a second time, this morning, right after yoga.  BTW....they open up at 9 am on Sundays versus their usual 6 am opening on weekdays.    I'll be heading back soon to try other flavors for sure.  Their boosts are 25 cents extra and definitely worth it.

First let me just say that it cracks me up to have such a high-end place like Vogue smack in the middle of Surprise.  It's a nice little...surprise!  A few girlfriends and I went here after a day of girly girl movie watching and it was such a nice treat to be able to sit out on Vogue's patio sipping their yummy wine.  I don't like wine, but they talked me into getting a glass of Mr. Loosen (Riesling, Germany) and it was not bad at all.  The four of us ordered the cheese plate to start with.  I'm not much of a gourmet cheese person (let's just say nacho cheese is one of my best friends).  So, I didn't quite love it as much as my friends did...but I did like the goat cheese and the pine nut Gouda.  We decided to each order two starters each so we could have a nice sampling of many dishes instead of getting entrees that we could enjoy on our own.  I highly recommend doing this!!  There is just so much on their menu that is appealing to the eye and stomach.  In all, we ordered the Vogue onion soup (which had a cheesy and super delicious flaky bread on top), beef skewers w/miso marinade, sweet potato fries w/sweet and spicy aiole sauce, mac & cheese, butternut squash w/vanilla, bruschetta (that night's version had pesto and cheese whipped together with a yellow tomato topping), and potato au gratin.  We had quite the spread in front of us.  Our waitress told us that she wanted to sit and join us!  It was a fantastic meal despite the few bites we got of each.  I was full by the time I had about 2-3 bites from each plate.    Vogue has a really relaxing atmosphere and wonderful service to boot.  Even though they were showing Ratoutille (Disney film) on the TVs, my friends tell me that many times they show fashion shows.  They have a huge list of different martinis, all named after designers.  I wish I was a martini fan so I could try them.  But the wine was wonderful treat for a night of sitting and relaxing with girlfriends.

I went just last night for the first time to see the opening of Into the Woods with a good friend who got tickets through her work.    This is a fantastic venue that does a really really nice job with their production.  The set was phenomenally done and the singing/acting of the cast was especially good.  One would not expect to find something like this outside of the downtown area in a non-conventional theatre.    My friend and I got there at the start of dinner service, which I DO NOT recommend doing!  You see, that means we were in our seats from about 5:30 all the way to the end of the show...at 10:30.  While the seats are pretty cushy, they are not theatre seats, but rather dinner seats (with more cushioning than usual).  But sitting in these seats for almost 5 hours straight (I think I got up once during intermission) was painful.  It didn't help that we were in the back of one of the decks, so we had a step right in front of our table.  When we turned our chairs for the show, that meant there was about 6 inches of space for my feet to sit.  I couldn't get comfortable as I would have at a show in a traditional theatre.  By the way, they serve dinner till 7, so get there a little later, since the show starts at 7:30.  That aside, this was a great experience to be had in AZ.  The food was what killed it...completely....as so many others have said here.  It started off well with the coconut shrimp appetizer.  I really wish I would have just ordered 3 or 4 plates of that to spare me from my super dry teriyaki pork (no pineapples or chunks of anything fun on top) and over-salted fingerling potatoes.  My friend had their chicken, which was a little less dry and had a tastier sauce, but her rice pilaf was waaaaay overdone.  Our desserts were a little bit better, but not by much.  The apple crisp lacked the flavor crisps should have and my lemon cookie was very lemony.  It seems the price tag for the tickets pays the actors and employees of ABT, rather than the quality of food.  AKA, it's a bit like a banquet hall who pumps out food quickly.  I did love my Limelight Margarita though!!!    Everyone should go to ABT at least once.  It's pretty pricey, so take 4 people (not 2) because you can split the cost of the table.  Appetizers and upgraded entrees (like prime rib and steak) are extras as well as the drinks.

Mmmmmmmmm...margarita on the rocks...mmmmmmmmmm!  Went in here for HH one Friday night and ordered a regular margarita on the rocks and loved every sippage second of it!  On this particular visit I ordered the wedge salad and thought it was pretty tasty too.  Did I mention that their margarita was really good?  It def was not out of a machine (Macayos...ahem!).

After having gone for the second time last night, I figured it was high time I get in here and talk up the Parmesan Crusted Chicken I've had both times.  The white cheddar mashed potatoes are worth an order of this dish!  Get yourself the Chocolate Raspberry combo drink with some stout and raspberry beer (I can't find it on their online menu, but check it out for sure).  It doesn't matter how many people have already said it...their pizookies need to happen at the end of your meal!  The peanut butter is always my first choice but their fancy salted caramel pizookie is good too.  We got the trio this time around and shared different bites with the whole table...if you're okay with sharing, this is definitely the way to go.

I have friends who have raved about this place over and over and I finally went with them to try it out for myself. Turns out...I love my friends, but they have not-so-good taste in especially well done sushi.   If you've read some of the other sushi reviews, I judge a place on their spicy tuna rolls. To me, this is something any decent sushi restaurant can do well. But if it's tasteless, such as Akai Hana's version, I know right then and there it won't be high on my list of favorites.   I tried the Blue Flame roll (highly recommended by the friends) and while it was a decent roll, I was extremely put off by the fake crab they used. The other was one I can't remember the name for, but it had cilantro on top of it. I loved the unique flavor it gave to the roll (I want to say this one had tuna), but it still wasn't quite flavorful enough.    With all the fun named rolls this place has, I was sad to see that it wasn't something I plan to add to my list of go to spots for some super tasty sushi. I'd rather go to Ah Hai on Cotton Lane.

My friend and I go on regular sushi dates and chose Blu because of all the wonderful reviews here on Yelp.  We were extremely disappointed!  They have happy hour everyday from 3-6 and so we went on Sunday around 4.  There were only about 6 people inside so we sat at the sushi bar.    We ordered spicy tuna rolls and crab tempura rolls on the happy hour menu as well as the shrimp soybean paper roll off of their regular menu.  I'd like to say I've had enough sushi from a large handful of places in Arizona so I know what a yummy spicy tuna roll is.    The spicy tuna rolls they brought out were extremely gummy because the rice was well over done.  Now, the tuna itself was very tasty and perfectly spicy.  I also really loved that cucumber was added so there was a nice little crunch.  But the gumminess completely ruined it and I had a hard time wanting to not gag.    As for the crab tempura rolls, the crab was imitation and that made me really annoyed seeing as how the ratings were high here and the prices on their menu are as well.  A place like this should not be using imitation crab.  The rolls were completely tasteless!  :(   Our favorite (if that's what you want to call it) was the shrimp soybean paper roll.  But again, the crab was imitation and lacked flavor so the entire roll was off.  It was not rolled tight at all either.    Something else I did not think I'd see at a place with such high ratings was a sushi chef that would be sitting at the bar (not the sushi bar) drinking a pint of beer with a customer.  When we were finished and leaving he was outside in front of the restaurant sitting on the patio with the same customer smoking a cigarette as well.  Hmmmmmmm.  I do not plan on going back even thoiugh there was one or two rolls I wanted to try.  I was completely put off by the gumminess of the rice because I've never had sushi with that issue and I was DEFNITELY not happy to be eating imitation crab at a place that I had thought was higher end.  Not okay at all!

I really only go here to get nail polish I can't get at Ulta, Seche Vite, and some of their Palladio makeup products.  But other than that, I hate stepping in here.  Every single time I've come in the ladies or girls working there have no welcoming bone in their body.  I say hi to them and they just look at me, don't smile or say anything back, and then set right back to standing at the register or rearranging the shelves.  I've tried joking with them at the register or striking up a conversation, but they aren't having it.  I don't feel welcome in there and I feel like I'm a burden to them.  I wish I didn't have to go in at all, but they are close by and I just try to run in and run out with what I need.

I cannot eat any other deli sandwiches now that I have Sugar and Spice in my life.  I don't know what it is about them, but there's nothing else like it.  My absolute favorite is their chicken salad on toasted white bread with lettuce, cucumbers, banana peppers and jalapenos.  Their egg salad is also tasty too...but the chicken salad is to die for.  The best part is that it is so very local!  The owner is there almost every single time I'm in.    Not only do I obsess over their sandwiches and dream of them until I have it again, but their housemade pastries are to die for as well...along the lines of Bashas.  The sprinkled donut is a staple of my visits, but their chocolate croissant is definitely a must-have as well.  I have had their cronut too, but it was a little too sweet for my liking.    I've got their sandwich to go and eat picnic style at the Litchfield Park Lake too and it's just so dang glorious!  I have yet to try their breakfast treats (besides the donut for lunch of course) but their teas and coffees are worth a visit alone too.

I was in the mood to try Tepanyaki and Ah-So is much closer to me than Benihana's.  But I was not happy with the food.  It was not as tasty.  The fried rice was pretty bland.  The soup they bring you and the salad were pretty tasty and the shrimp we got was worth it.  I don't think I will go back though b/c it just wasn't the same as Benihana.  For as pricey as it was, it just wasn't what I hoped for tastewise.  Meh.

Why oh why can't there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents I've been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me.   I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good.

I don't think of myself as a huge burger fan.  It takes a really great burger for me to get excited about them is what I am trying to say.    A friend and I stumbled upon an ad for BluBurger Grille in a little pamphlet and decided we'd try it.  The next afternoon we went all the way out to Scottsdale, hoping it wasn't too outrageously priced.  We were pleasantly surprised when we found a non-snooty atmosphere with a simple and fairly inexpensive menu.    They have a variety of, to me, exotic meats like Bison and even Kobe beef.  There are several already fixed burgers you can pick from or you can make your own combination.  I went for the create-my-own angle and ordered a turkey burger with a whole wheat bun (they have several to choose from), pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, chopped garlic, mixed greens, and the amazing roasted red pepper mayo.  Their sweet potato fries are pretty tasty too, but I got the coleslaw and that was decent.    When they set my burger in front of me, I definitely could tell this was not going to be a normal burger...remember, I am not a burger person.  My first bite could only be described as otherwordly.  A messy burger is the best kind in my book and this one was dripping with juiciness (not from the mayo) it was the burger.  I have never had such a juicy perfect burger!  I think my friend got a bison burger and hers was also dripping with delicious juices, so it wasn't just the turkey.    About a month later, I took my hubby out to the same place...and he is a total burger person.  He most definitely approved and raves about it whenever I bring it up.  There is one supposedly opening up closer to us in the west valley, so make your way to one of them...it is worth it, burger person or not.

The Scottsdale location has since closed down and there is now one in the Park West area in Glendale.  I have been there 3 different times now and it has gone downhill each time.  I'm not sure what it is, but the quality of the food is not as good and I've walked away for the last time not wanting to go back.  It's just not the same as it was a few years ago.

I have no clue what good Cajun food is b/c I quite literally have never had authentic style Cajun food (I am not counting that Zatarans rice in the box either).  But, after reading the reviews for it on Yelp, I HAD to try it!    Although I was way too chicken to try the crawfish or the alligator, I did go for some shrimp.  It was fried in this very crispy and light batter with a really tasty seasoning.  I decided on dirty rice as my side.  Dirty rice (I had to ask) is cooked with some pork and beans as well as some strong and flavorful seasonings.    Flavors of Louisiana is a small place, but was packed when we walked in after seeing a movie early in the evening.  There was a large family and several couples eating in and waiting to take their food out...a very good sign in my opinion!    If you are in the same situation as me and have no clue about Cajun food...here's what I learned while waiting for my food and reading the educational bit on their menu:   Authentic Cajun food is actually not spicy as many say, it is actually flavorful, slow cooked, made with love, and full of mouth-watering seasonings.  Interesting.    FOL is family owned and operated and they are incredibly friendly.  While we were there the owner came out from the kitchen to hug and greet what seemed to be either family friends and/or regular customers two different times.  One couple walked by us on their way out after eating and told us, "This place sure could make someone fat."  I overhead more than one family tell the owner how they will most definitely be coming back and how amazed they were at how delicious everything was.    I'm not sure if I'll go back only b/c I really have no clue about Cajun style food and what it entails.  But, the shrimp and dirty rice I had were very good and I would have it again if I was in the neighborhood!  Oh, and I almost forgot, the dipping sauce for the shrimp made me want to lick the cup clean after using it for my shrimp...I'm not even sure what the seasonings in it were, but who cares, it was yummy!

These are the types of places I love to go into and enjoy when I'm downtown and there needs to be more just like it!  While my friend and I only went in here for a tasty cold beverage while waiting for Pomo to open for the evening next door, we still quite enjoyed ourselves as we sat at the bar and talked with the bartender.  I do wish they had way more options on tap though...Blue Moon was the only Hefe?...blech!  My friend quite loved her chocolate martini though and practically licked the glass clean (don't kill me for saying that Mary).  Apparently they have a really good breakfast, so it would be pretty nice to come back and try some of the food.

It is so tricky to rate Eest because it is still not the kind of Chinese food I love from back home in California.  I don't know why it is so dang hard to find tasty Asian food here in the valley, especially in the west.  I honestly prefer Abacus Inn...but it is no where near close enough to my house.    For being shoved in a corner of an almost dead strip mall, it is a jewel.  The decor is much nicer than most places like it and there is a ton of space.  You can tell the owners take pride in their restaurant.    We ordered their egg drop soup and while it was pretty good, I did have to add some salt to it for taste.  The veggies in it were almost too big to eat with a soup spoon too, which was a little annoying...but I still enjoyed it.  I got the Sizzling Mongolian Beef and wish I would have asked for it to be spicier.  The waitress warned me that people say it is too hot and so I asked her to make it mild...well, it was so mild it wasn't spicy at all.  Wah!  We did really like their sweet and sour chicken as well.  Our order of pork fried rice was also worth it.  I definitely want to go back and order other dishes on their menu.  They give you huge portions that make for a great lunch the next day.

I too was at the work training with Ayesha (see very first review) and like her I wanted something different than the usual fast food places nearby.    I'm an incredibly picky person when it comes to authentic Mexican food.  Growing up in San Diego, I grew up with some of the best tasting food around.  When I moved here I was unimpressed over and over again with the places I kept trying around the west valley and even the east valley.  At one point, I even swore off trying any new Mexican style restaurant altogether.  No more gross, greasy, no flavor Mexican food for me!  The Sonoran style food here just doesn't jive with me and my taste for flavorful Baja style food.  Yep, that's right...there's a difference.  Baja style is tastier with a lot more flavor per bite.  I have found that Sonoran is more bland and greasier.  I was pretty skeptical when we walked into Jalapenos (Tio Freddy's).  But then I picked up their menu and saw they had Carne Asada Fries...a San Diego favorite!  Forget everything else on the menu, that is what I ordered.  It was delicious!  Not only was the food flavorful but Tio Freddy and his wife were amazing.  Even though it is a place where you order at the counter, they brought me my food, offered me sauce from the sauce bar, and came by more than once to check on how I was enjoying my food!    It is a small place in a strip mall and I have never noticed it before, and I know others haven't.  If you want to try some great Mexican food at a really inexpensive price...try it out!

My husband and I chose to go to Wet 'n Wild for our 5th anniversary mini-celebration and it was a very good choice!  We had never been when it was Waterworld, but my husband had driven by it and told me that it is a lot bigger by far.    We got there 30 minutes before it opened (about 6 days or so after opening day) in order to be able to get past the crowd and beat the afternoon heat.  I had checked the website a couple days before we went to see how much tickets cost, what types of slides they had, and get directions.  I found out that they also have private cabanas around the wave pool.  They are available for $85 on weekdays and $100 on weekends.  Yes, that is a bit expensive, but since it was our anniversary, I thought it would be pretty nice to have this private little spot to make it feel more like a mini-vacation.  The cabanas include a ceiling fan, two lounge chairs, two more chairs, a table, T.V., food and beverage service, and two innertubes.  As we stood in the ticket line, I read the signs they had indicating the prices for tickets and the cabanas.  But when we got up to the window and asked for two adult tickets and a private cabana, we were told the private cabanas wouldn't be ready until next week.    I would have given Wet 'n Wild 5 stars, but that one star is gone b/c I was pretty upset that they advertised the cabanas on the website and even on the ticket counter signs.  If they weren't ready, there should have been an apparent note on the site and some sort of tape or poster covering up that part of the sign at the ticket window!!!!!!!  Since it was opening week, there were actually a lot of things that didn't seem organized.  We couldn't get the cabana, so I wanted to rent innertubes so we wouldn't have to wait around for them in line.  I have been to plenty of waterparks to know how long you sometimes have to wait for tubes as the riders get off the slides.  But, they told us that there was no need to buy them b/c there were plenty.  Well, that might have been the case for the first hour after it opened for the day, but we did have to wait at one of the slides for tubes.  Eventually, we had waited for so long for the double tube, that we gave up and just grabbed individual tubes.  Yes, not a big deal...but enough not to give them that 5th star.    Also, a lot of waterparks don't do well in Arizona b/c of how much hotter it gets here than, let's say, California.  I was a little weirded out to find that there were no misters in the hotter parts of the park.  There weren't as many awnings and coverings as there should have been.  The ground was really hot in some spots where they could have easily put coverings...it's Arizona...it gets HOT!  It was a bit of a pain to have to wear shoes and carry them on to the slides.  Again, not a huge deal...but enough not to get that 5th star.    There were a few slides that were unique to other parks I have been to in California.  As an adult, I found the park to be great for all ages.  The slides that have the large bowls (there are two of them) were extremely fun and gave me quite an adrenaline rush...loved that!  I recommend getting there half an hour before it opens (which is when we arrived).  You are allowed to park, pay, and get lockers before the rides actually open.  But the bathrooms are not open, so change ahead of time.    One last thing, I am used to indoor locker rooms at water parks and I was a bit annoyed to find that I had to leave my cell phone and digital camera in a locker that would soon become a hot house.  I would have thought that in Arizona, they would have at least put 4 walls around the lockers and combined them with the indoor changing rooms and bathrooms...just like all other parks I have been to.  I thought that was a bit weird.  All in all, we had a really great time and were happy that we chose to go, even if it was crowded.  There was a perfect amount of scary slides and easy going slides.  We will be heading back next summer!

I'm definitely a fan.  A couple of friends and I came here for a birthday celebration on a Saturday night.  I thoroughly enjoyed the pub atmosphere and the variety of choices on the menu.  I had the potato leek soup, which was perfectly creamy and...leeky?  LOL.  And I couldn't help myself...I also had Ciaran's Fish Sandwich, which has their Guinness batter fried fish on an egg bun.  It was super tasty and went well with my soup and beer.    The only thing I didn't especially like was the Irish band that basically prevented us from being able to have conversations with each other.  It was way too loud.  I love it when restaurants bring in local bands (but just like The Yard downtown)...turn the damn volume down!  It's not a concert and people do like to converse over plates of food.

While this is the closest Goodwill to me, it is by far not one that I enjoy going in to.  It's pretty small and not really well-kept the way others I've been to are.  Not much of a selection either...so I'll stick to some of the other Goodwills around the valley.  Although, when we moved and brought over about 4 different carloads of stuff to donate, the line was super long.  The guys in the back were pretty awesome and hilarious though and very helpful, so there's that.

My mom was visiting and we wanted a major sugar fix.  Here in the West Valley, we sadly don't have many dessert type bakeries (unlike the Scottsdale area and East Valley...waaaaaahhhhh!).  After checking out Yelp mouth-watering reviews, we really wanted to try Shelley's.    What we got: Buttermilk Pie (the free sample was truly yummy!) Lemon Bars (they were to die for!) Almond Bar (this one was tasty, but not my favorite) Macaroons  Vanilla Cupcake (with super cute flowers on top)  I would definitely go back for another lemon bar and to try one of her other cakes.  It is in a fantastic location in Caitlin Court and Shelley is as nice and helpful as everyone says she is!

I love this place!  They aren't pushy and it has my favorite atmosphere of all nail salons I've been to.  Their chairs are starting to get a little old and breaking down now.  But for a long time they were one of the only places I could go where I didn't sit in a broken chair.  Shoot...half the time I go is to get that massage from those chairs!  I love to get their basic pedicure, but my other favorite is the hot stone version as well.  Bottom line, they aren't pushy like so many other salons out there.

Screwballs is my new go-to dive bar for HH at the end of a heinous work week!  It is in a spot that doesn't get much traffic, so the reviews are true that the service isn't so fantastic...but that's because there is usually only one server/bartender and a person running the off track betting window.     But, the bar food is tasty and the drinks are too.  The bartender, who has been the same guy both times I've been in, is still very helpful and apologetic if he gets super busy.  He stays on top of it pretty darn well for being the only on there.  Poor guy.  The last time we were in, there was a 2nd server and the service was quick and the food came out in a super speedy fashion.    Try the fried zucchini and the garlic cheese bread...sure it's probably just some quick frozen fare, or maybe it's not.  But, there is something about it that tastes so delicious with a cold glass of brew.  I do love their hot wings as well for as inexpensive as they are.    It's worth going in for at least one visit.  You may or may not like the service, depending on if they are understaffed.    On the other hand, if my review gets more people in...then they will start bringing in a 2nd server every time and no one will be able to complain about it anymore!!

Maybe I'm missing something.  My mom, who is visiting, and I went here for lunch today after she had found a few creperies online.  We have had plenty of crepes from different types of places and these were not what we wanted at all!    I ordered the Matterhorn which was more like a taco salad since it was in a crispy bowl-shaped crepe.  This is what I chose because it has proscuitto.  But I was so grossed out by it after a few bites.  It came with the proscuitto laid out in slices on top of the salad.  Even the steak-type knife they gave me would not cut through it.  My mom was half finished with her lunch by the time I got so frustrated that I had to pull it apart with my fingers.  I love proscuitto on sandwiches but I was incredibly skeeved out by how slimy it was and I ended up almost gagging a few times.  It tasted just fine, but the sliminess of the meat and the fact that I couldn't chew through the fat after already swallowing the lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese grossed me out to the core!    My mom ordered one of the crepes with mushrooms, swiss cheese, and ham.  She is a huge fan of crepes and she thought hers was a bit flavorless.  We were also not impressed with the not-so-fluffy crepes that were made out of buckwheat!  Ick!    I walked in with high hopes because the actual interior looked like a chalet and I felt like I was on a bit of a trip to France.  There were even TVs that apparently show the kitchen so you can watch the chef...but they weren't even turned on until right before we left.  :(  They do serve fondue as well and I might go back to try it and give this place another try...but I am NOT getting any variety of crepe again.  We forgoed the desserts because we were not happy with our meal and wanted to get desserts from elsewhere.  So, I'll have to maybe try one of their desserts on my possibly return trip.

Loved Squid Ink!  They have such unique and interesting specialty rolls that I haven't seen anywhere else.  But they aren't so unique that they taste crazy like some specialty rolls I've had elsewhere.  We had the Dirty Rockstar Roll, which was very spicy but delicious too, Flying Phoenix (had a tasty but almost too overpowering pepper sauce), and my go-to at any sushi spot, Spicy Tuna.  There are at least 6 different house rolls that I MUST go back to try!  My friend and I sat at the sushi bar and had a great time with our sushi chef.  A ton of people ordered the "Cougar" Roll which is wrapped in think cucumber...the chef made at least 7 of them while we were sitting there.  I will be going back for sure!  The only downside I experience was that our waitress didn't come by very often at all and we had to wait quite some time to get drink refills and to even get our bill.  P.S.  I almost forgot!  The kitchen is open and right behind the sushi bar.  I don't know what the issue is but they were burning all sorts of stuff on the grill and there were several occasions where I was choking on the smoke.  It didn't look like the hood was above the right spot and so the smoke was filling up the area where we happened to be sitting.  You could even see on the ceiling that it was yellowed.  Will this stop me from coming again?...No, but it definitely might keep me from sitting in the dining area around the sushi bar.

My sushi friend and I went for our 2nd sushi meal today and we were incredibly annoyed and dissatisfied by the service and even the rolls.    There were only 4 tables of people in the dining room (one person sitting at the sushi bar) and 1 waitress.  I think there was one hostess as well.   When we first walked in at 3 pm, the start of happy hour, we saw a sign that said they'd be closing at 5 for their staff holiday party.  We are attributing this to the horrible service we received thinking they were too busy getting ready for the party and in a hurry to get us out of there so they could enjoy their party.    It took about 3 minutes to be seated (again...there were only 3 other tables of people at the time).  Then once we were seated, we waited about 6 minutes to even get a waitress to come over and get our drink order...and all we ordered was water!  Again, we then waited about 5 minutes to get the water and for someone to come take our order.  Once the person came over, who happened to actually be the bartender, we ordered garlic edamame and told her we were ready to order our sushi.  But she walked away and didn't come back for another 10 minutes or so to take our order.    The garlic edamame were not garlicky at all.  We paid more for the garlic version and there was barely even a hint of extra flavor.    We ordered the Cougar Roll this time after seeing so many people order it.  Not only was it not what the hype made it out to be, but the cucumber was very overpowering and the shrimp was quite fishy tasting.  We also got the Buffalo Chicken rolll, which isn't exactly sushi, but we were unimpressed.  The combo of the sticky rice and the heavy chicken (which were in tempura...yum!) wasn't quite right.  The buffalo flavor only lasted a few seconds b/c the sauce was only drizzled on top of the rolls...I think it would have been soooooo much better if the chicken had been covered in the sauce instead.  Last but definitely the least was the Jibs roll.  I loved the tempura of course and the cream cheese, but it wasn't really that flavorful sadly.  :-(  All in all, we paid $40 for our 3 rolls and the edamame and it was way too pricey for the horrible service and the not so tasty rolls.  It was not worth the price or the drive.  I won't be returning at all after this latest experience.  I have way too many other favorite sushi joints closer to my home that I love and experience better service with.

Mmmmmmmmmm....Gaaaaaaaaspers!  Mary S. took me here (see her review below) and we definitely enjoyed ourselves.  The fresh bread they brought out enticed me right away and their menu choices for creative pasta and meat dishes did as well.  I had so much trouble choosing off the menu, that our super nice waiter talked me into one of their specials.  It was a chicken dish that had a lemon sauce to die for!  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauce was not too tart or thinned out.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and ate way more than I normally do.    Mary let me try a piece of her margherita pizza that she had them add sausage to and I must say, it is way better than the pizza over at Pizzeria Bianco.  It wasn't burnt on the bottom or edges and the toppings were flavorful...and I didn't have to wait in line for 2 hours to eat it!    We agonized over the dessert menu and finally decided to share the cheesecake.  It did not disappoint and was moist as moist can be.  Yum!  Gasper's definitely requires a return trip, or two, or three!

Let me just preface this one by saying...most of this review is based on the service not the food!  I would like to say that this place was fun and tasty, but it honestly wasn't.  We went in there around 10 at night and just wanted to something to munch on b/c we had not eaten dinner and no one seemed hungry enough to sit down somewhere and order a late night dinner.  So, the 5 of us decided to order about 4 different appetizers including the fried pickles, potato skins, buffalo wings, and buffalo fingers.    My first experience with fried pickles was a bust and I had high hopes.  There was way too much cornmeal involved.  While I did actually like the buffalo fingers and potato skins...all of that went out the window because of the honest to goodness douchetard waiter we had.  I'd like to say I remember his name, but all I remember was his purposefully lopsided mohawk and his disgustingly rude attitude.  Granted, we came in and just ordered appetizers and my friends had ordered their huge yard drink before we came in.  But was it really necessary for him to tell us how annoyed he was about these things?  He was a jerk and told us he would shoot himself in the head if we wanted to separate our checks at the end of our meal.  And no...he was not joking.

I've been twice already, once at the actual tepanyaki table and another at in the "regular" section of the restaurant.  Both were great!  I had their shrimp tempura on my first trip and it was absolutely yummmmmmmmmy!  It filled me up quickly and left me wishing I had room for more.  I chose to get the clear soup instead of the miso soup for my appetizer and I liked it more since I'm not a fan of tofu.  But both are great and just as good as other soups I've had at places like Benihana's.    When I sat at the hibachi table, I ordered spicy tuna rolls (of course!) and wasn't impressed enough...although it was not the worst I've tasted.  It has a really neat and classy atmosphere and both waitresses and the chef I've had were friendly, fun, and provided great service.  I plan to go back, but I will stick with the uber delicious shrimp tempura instead of perhaps trying some sushi.  Their fried rice is also fairly good as well as compared to Benihana's and waaaaaay better than Ah-So's.

Finally a cupcake spot in the west valley!!!!  After having one of the lemon chiffon cupcakes at a baby shower, I knew I had to stop in to check out their other flavors.  It was perfectly flavored and moist.    So, I went yesterday for the first time and was not let down.  It is in the most quaint and nice spot in downtown Avondale.  (Next time I want to eat one of my cupcakes out on their patio type area and relax under the trees.)    We got 6 cupcakes:  Strawberry Shortcake, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Triple Chocolate, Samoa, Lemon Chiffon, and Sweet Potato Pie.  Scarfed the strawberry, triple chocolate, and sweet potato pie as soon as we got home.  The strawberry was incredibly moist and I absolutely loved the fresh strawberries!  The tripe chocolate was to die for.  I am not a chocolate cake fan, but that was some well done cupcake!  The frosting was sinful and the cinnamon cake was a very nice touch.  My mom had the sweet potato pie cupcake and she really enjoyed it.  I did take a bite and the taste was very yummy, almost more like a pumpkin pie cupcake in case you are curious.  It has cream cheese frosting, which anyone would love.  I did have the Samoa for dessert after dinner and loved the toasted coconut and caramel, but this one wasn't my favorite.    The husband and wife team were incredibly nice and helpful.  We came in a little early on Tuesday afternoon (they are closed on Sundays and Mondays).  So, they had not had a chance to make all the flavors quite yet.  We ended up not being able to get a few of the types of wanted.  But they were incredibly helpful and even gave us a taste of the cream cheese frosting they were making on the spot.  Yum!    I will be stopping in again to try some of the other flavors soon!

I've been back many times since my first visit...and really wish I could go every week!  Their store hours improved once they got up and running more, which makes it ever easier for me to go in when I have a craving.    My absolute favorite flavor, one of their regulars for $2.75, is Peanut Butter Sugar Cookie.  Mmmmmmmmm.  Peanut butter frosting (which is perfect) with sugar sprinkled on top, and a sugar cookie cupcake.  It is moist, not too rich, but seriously tasty.  My other favorite is the Chocolate Peanut Butter.  Peanut butter frosting with chocolate chips sprinkled on top and a chocolate cupcake.  Do you see a pattern here?  I recently tried their specialty cupcake, Salted Caramel.  The frosting definitely had that salted caramel taste.  There is a seriously sinful caramel filling in the middle of the cupcake.  But I thought the cupcake was a bit dense for my liking.    This is my absolute favorite bakery in the west valley and I recommend it time and time again to friends.  The owners are very friendly and don't mind answering questions or enlightening your requests.  For example, if you see they are out of it in their cases up front, ask anyway, because they almost always have another batch in the back.  They are also at Glendale Glitters if you happen to be there and want to stop there for a kupcake.    Also, one of the other times I was in, I found out they serve Teavana tea.  So, being a fan of it, I was quite excited to know I could get freshly brewed tea and complete with rock sugar if I wanted.    Enjoy!  Don't pass up Kreative Kupcakes!

For a specialty candy store I think they need way way way more international candy!  I love that they are right next to the movie theatre though, but hope that they put one in at Park West.  I do like the variety of sodas, but haven't purchased any.  They supposedly carry special holiday candy from England during Christmas, but it didn't come in this year.  Apparently, their number one selling product is bacon-flavored soda!  Puuuuuuuuke!  Double puke was seeing Buffalo Wing-flavored soda on their shelf.    Definitely go if you are in the area just to take a look.  They do sell some very old skool candy as well.

As a fan of Indies and cult classics, this is the place to go here in Phoenix!  It is in the beloved Roosevelt Row right across from Angel Trumpet's Ale House (another beloved spot of mine).  Did I say there is a bar in a movie theater?!  Yep!  Popcorn and beer?  Yep!    FilmBar has a nice local vibe to it and is one of those places everyone should go, even if you don't dig smaller films.  They have a pretty well-packed calendar with movies for all types of fans.  Even though I've been twice, I haven't had a chance to attend a movie/event like The Big Lebowski (during their March Mystery series) where they had a "The Dude" photobooth.  But that's just another reason why people should wander in and try this place out.    They have a good selection of wine and beer, although I wish they had more types of drafts instead of being packed with San Tan Brewery brews.  Not a fan of that brewery, so it's not my schtick.  But the tasty and fresh popcorn with a Mexican Coke does me just fine!    Their actual theater has comfortable auditorium (small-scale) style seating.  The screen is a perfect large size.  It is just like being at home instead of in one of those huge theatres with people messing with their cell phones and taking up a storm.  Those types of moviegoers won't be found here...thank goodness!  I love the local art on the walls, quirky lounge, and bathrooms.  LOL  After 2 visits, I plan to make many many more.  And I don't want to miss out on their Oscars viewing party next year either.

What a great discovery this place has been!  It is hidden away in the little strip mall that is off of Cotton Lane and Yuma Road in Goodyear.  But don't let it's hidden location fool you.  I've now been two times and enjoyed myself and their food on both occasions.  My sushi date friend, Cyndie, and I wanted to try this place after having a horrific experience at Blu Sushi (see my review for the full story) and we were desperate to find a new place that had that "it" sushi.  We seriously found it!  We went for their happy hour and ordered several different rolls including my necessity (especially when trying out a new sushi bar), spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, and crunchy roll.  All three of them were attractive and tasty.    But we weren't full and wanted to order another roll, so we ordered the Pink Lady roll off of the regular menu.  It was brought out to us and set down on the table and the two of us couldn't close our mouths or stop staring.  The rolls were in pink soypaper, shaped as hearts, and had a blinking light in the center.  It was gorgeous and...a sushi place that has fun with their presentation by decorating the plates?!  Heck yeah!  We were impressed and it was very good.  The Pink Lady has cucumber, avocado, crab, and crunch wrapped w/soy bean paper, Eel sauce & spicy mayo.  It was incredibly delicious...did I already say that?  We were hooked for sure and both decided we'd be coming back to try more.  On our 2nd trip, we ordered the Pink Lady again...I'm pretty sure this will be my mainstay everytime I come.  But we also ordered the Scorpion Roll - shrimp tempura, cream cheese, inside topped w/kani, masago in spicy mayo & eel sauce (which had an amazing decoration on it...I think it was a lobster), sweet potato roll, and California rolls (for a friend...but they weren't flavorful as was expected).  The scorpion roll melted in our mouths.  There was a little too much cream cheese for my liking, but still very good.  All the plates had fun decorations added...one was made to look like a butterfly using the rolls.  There's something about this added touch that makes me appreciate them even more.  The service is great and the servers we have had are very nice and welcoming as well.  I will be coming back again soon!

When I can take my students on a field trip and not worry about a thing, I am in teacher heaven!  On top of that, the ladies and gentleman who work with our students are incredibly knowledgeable, professional, and don't mind putting behavior issues to rest when they arise.   Everything is very well organized for all involved.  Every time I have been now, the parents and other teachers can't thank me enough for setting this field trip up.  Most importantly, the kids absolutey eat everything up.  Their recent remodel has definitely taken an already great place and turned it into something even bigger and better.  Thank you Halle Heart Center!

Complete and utterly heaven!   Going here on a really empty stomach is your best bet...because you will want to eat every single last crumb of your pizza dough. And well...because it's dough, it will fill you up fast. The touch of molasses they add is what really makes this the best bit of heaven. I don't know how else to describe it since I find myself having to wipe the drool off my chin each time I try to think of a way to say it here.  My friends and I started out with their garlic and parmesan pretzels. They make these with the same dough they use to make the pizzas. Not too garlicky and just the right amount of parmesan. Mmmmmmm.  I got the Philosopher's Pie which has mushrooms, sliced steak, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, and a garlic/olive oil base (rather than red sauce). Sweet sassy molassy! I've always liked my pizza pretty plain (think Marghuerita) and have to have sauce on my pizza (since it's usually dry without it). But this, THIS, was perfect! I was afraid it would be overpowering with the garlic base, but nope.   And it made for the best leftovers, heated up in the oven not the microwave, for 2 days after bringing it home.    Our servers were super friendly and fun as well. Thanks! It's probably better that I don't live closer to MM, because I'd be a rolling ball of dough if I did.

My first time at Absolutely Chic was well worth the visit!  I had found their first time visit special for a 1-hour massage online.  I've been to Dolce in Arrowhead a few times and had many professional massages when I lived in California.    I must say, the swedish therapeutic massage that I received was wonderful!  It was more than just one of those spa massages (even though that is what their name implies).  It was much more of a therapeutic massage as my therapist worked on the areas that I needed worked the most.  She focused on them longer than usual and worked most of the knots out (as much as one can be worked out when as tense as I am).  The different techniques she used felt so incredible on those trouble areas and she applied the right sort of hard and medium pressure according to the amount of tension in the areas.  I felt relaxed while laying on the massage table and was comfortable in the room and with my therapist.    I am very much interested in returning as they have a type of membership that does not include a contract.  It's much more of a deal than Massage Envy because you are not required to come in once a month to get the membership price.  While it is a further drive for me, I am planning on possibly getting the membership and returning many more times.  All the ladies/therapists there were very kind and helpful as well.  I would feel comfortable with any of them.    Absolutely Chic is in a hard to find location at the back of the little business park they are in.  When you enter the parking lot, drive around to the back side (on the left).  They are located upstairs on the 2nd floor of Suite D.  Do not take the elevator...b/c it is their back entrance and the door is locked (you can call to have it unlocked or knock like we did, but they may not hear you).  Use the stairs so you can enter through the front.    Absolutely Chic is absolutely chic!!

We came here for a sweet bite after eating across the street at Federal Pizza.  The line was out the door, but no one seemed to mind waiting.    I was too busy looking at all the retro candy from my childhood, so when I got to the front of the line...I had no clue what I wanted and didn't want to hold the line up.  So, one of the gals suggested the Peanut Butter ice cream (score!) and the pretzel cone I had already planned to try...because...it's a pretzel and a cone!  I loved the creamy natural tasting peanut butter ice cream, but the cone was a bit of a let down.  It was a tad too salty and not light and airy like a regular pretzel.  It was thick and on the crunchy side.  So, I think I'll skip it the next time I go in.    We enjoyed sitting out back though!  Make sure you make your way back there instead of sitting out front where the line is a bit in the way.

Yes!  Yes there is a Vietnamese fusion restaurant in random as hell Surprise and it is absolutely phenomenal!  Definitely wait for a table if this place is packed because it will be well worth your time and patience.    I can't help myself when it comes to their ginger garlic chicken wings.  These things are flash fried to absolute crispy perfection.  You will want to lick your plate clean after sucking it off your fingers first.    My favorite dish to get each and every time I've been in is their firecracker shrimp with garlic noodles.  This dish is what dreams are made of by far!  The noodles are not too strong and are best companion to the crispy shrimp served alongside them.  I never have any shrimp left over, because that would be blasphemy, but having the noodles for leftovers the next day is always a treat.    This last time I went in, it was packed to the gills...but we waited it out because my gf had never been.  The owner recommended his sweet and sour ribs for her and just like the chicken wings...they had this nice crispiness to the outside and juicy on the inside.  Your food does take a while to come out, but that is because every thing is made completely fresh and not placed under any of those lame red lamps.

This is the place to be!  A very large group of my girlfriends and I went here for my birthday to paint and enjoy the day.  Art of Merlot made it one of the best birthdays I've had.  Even though you are painting the same thing when you are here, they let you explore with the colors and the way you want to paint.  How can you go wrong with a place that lets you drink wine at the same time?!    The girls who work here are very helpful and attentive as well.  If someone in the room had trouble keeping up or didn't see the last painting step, they stop and let you ask your question without making you feel like you are holding up everyone else.  They give you all the supplies, including the wine glasses and bottle opener as well as painting smocks.    Around the room are the many painting choices they offer as well.  I appreciate that they walk around with a camera and take pictures of the people you are with as well because then they post them on Facebook for you to tag and enjoy.  They truly allow you to relax and enjoy your time with them.  Plus, you walk away with a nice quality canvas that you create!    Thank you Art of Merlot for my birthday fun.  I WILL be back more than once!

I've spent several Saturdays here for a workshop to work on one of the hardest and most important processes of my teaching career!  It is a place where I know I can be taken care of all day and feel like I don't have to worry about a thing.    The staff is incredibly helpful and caring.  They provide great food and continuous beverages.  I like knowing I don't have to worry about cleaning up after myself either.  Their restrooms are well-kept and clean as well.  I appreciate that it's not freezing either like some other conference centers I've been to in the valley.    Thank you Desert Willow!

Woohoooooo!  We have located the holy grail of Thai food in the west valley!  (review is for take-out not dine-in)  Having been to Thai Orchid multiple times and thinking that it just wasn't my most favorite Thai spot, we decided to try something new one night when we felt like getting take-out...Thai style.    This place already has higher ratings than Thai Orchid.  So there you go!    Or course, I ordered Pad Won Sen and my hubby got his favorite, Pad Cee Ew.  Both do not come spicy, but we had ours made with mild spice...not knowing if this was one of those places that is higher or lower than their stated spice scale.  Well...their mild is definitely their medium!  So tread lightly and carefully.  Both dishes were way more flavorful than Thai Orchid for sure.  We were very impressed.    We have now ordered take-out from them 3 times and every time is just as good as the last!  Also?  Their grilled pot-stickers are spot on tasty.  Not a huge fan of their eggrolls or the sauce that comes with them though...I do prefer Thai Orchid's for sure.    If you're in the west valley, definitely order yourself some take-out or try dining in too.  It is well worth it!!

After getting a bad muscle spasm in my mid-back and not knowing if it would get better, I saw their introductory offer for a $39 and decided to go for it.   Their location here in Goodyear is a really calm and serene one. I expected it to look similar to Massage Envy, which to me doesn't have the feel of a spa when sitting in the front waiting area. But this place had that feel to it, which of course, made me feel more relaxed.  I did go on Father's Day or it may have been the day before or after, but it was crowded with men! I had a major giggle and insightful thoughts because I've never seen that many men at a spa or massage place. This wasn't just because of wives buying their husbands certificates either. As I sat waiting for my appointment, the front desk ladies were asking them how their family was doing, when they were moving out of the country, etc. They knew these gentlemen well. To me that said something about their return clients.  I can't remember who I had, but she was pregnant and had a unique name (which is probably why I can't remember since the pronunciation was so different). Either way, she was very calming and accomodating to my injury. I felt like her pressure was perfect and when it wasn't, I felt comfortable asking her to adjust, to which she did quickly and easily. I do plan on going back in the future and would love to get their monthly membership as well. I may try a different massage therapist, but only b/c I want to feel the styles of other therapists.

I've been a member for over a year now after leaving another massage therapist behind (one that used to come to my home every week for about $30).  Kaleena works on me every two weeks and I wouldn't have it any other way!  She does the BEST deep tissue massage I've ever had and she doesn't do what I call, "massage by numbers" but instead changes her pressure, spots she works on, etc. depending on what she notices in my body and my pains.  I woke up this morning super stiff and messed up from tension and stress.  All I told her was exactly that and I had one of the GREATEST and therapeutic sessions since I started getting massaged by her over a year ago.  I walked way feeling way way way less stiff and relieved as well.  Kaleena is never a disappointment and knows how to be a true therapeutic massage therapist!  Another time, I was recovering from surgery and ended up with a really debilitating lower back spasm that wouldn't go away for almost two weeks.  When I was finally well enough to lay flat on my back, I went in.  I pointed to the area where I was spasming and Kaleena worked gently yet deep on it here and there throughout my regular massage.  Thankfully, the two-week long spasm didn't come back!

A bunch of us Yelpers went to Del Frisco's for an afternoon of appetizers and drinks for a Hangover III inspired evening.    The patio (lower level) is a pretty nice little space with lots of misters (year for that!).  Both drinks that I had were incredibly tasty and at a nice strong level (helloooooooo!).  I had the Morning After, which was a super tasty coconutty fizzy drink...definitely get yourself one!  I also had their margarita, which has agave nectar in it, making it on the sweet side....it was also very good!    As for the appetizers, there were some that I really liked and some I was a bit partial to.  None that I hated though, mind you.  The parmesan shoestring fries didn't hold enough flavor...and I am a HUGE parmesan obsessed fan!  I did really like their Philly sliders and the guacamole, which had a nice kick to it (yessssss!).  The lollipop wings were decent (a little lacking in the spicy buffalo tradition) and the tomato flatbread was just okay to me.  It would be really nice to go back for dinner and see what that's all about.    The staff is very nice as is the manager as well.  Definitely hit up Del Frisco's if you are in the Biltmore area.

While it is really awesome to have a locally owned place like this on our side of the valley, I hope they improve their food!  I'm no Gordon Ramsey or Robert Irvine, but I do know delicious food when I taste it (I've traveled the world and have tried many a tasty bites locally as well).  The wine selection and wines themselves were very good.  I had a really tasty peach bellini and my friend enjoyed two different glasses of white wine during our time there.  But this review (the two stars) is more for the food.    Happy hour bruschetta (tomato, olive oil, & pecorino):  Pretty tasty, but could have used either balsamic or a bit of onion because it was lacking flavor.  Also, the bread used was clearly not higher end.  Happy hour bruschetta (brie, almonds, honey):  Now this one was very very good!  I"m not a brie fan, but I found this one to have a nice amount of flavor and the almonds added a good amount of crunch.    Italian Beef and Artichoke Panini:  Another huge let down.  I thought this one would be very flavorful due to the artichokes.  But sadly, they were jarred and had that jarred flavor that just doesn't seem right.  If they had been fresh, it would have made a huge difference!  I wouldn't have expected jarred to have ended up on this sandwich at such a nice place.  Also, the bread they use is not a true sourdough, but exactly like a loaf of white bread one would buy at the grocery store...not quite Wonderbread, but very similar.  It had the Panini grill marks, but because the bread wasn't fresh or true sourdough, the sandwich again just came off as cheap...and it was a $14 sandwich!!!!!!!  Brie and Apple Panini (my friend's):  I didn't want to take a bite of this one.  But she really liked hers because of the flavor the brie gave it.  She also had an issue with the cheap store bough bread though.    Nutella filled croissant:  Okay, so we told each other this had better not be store bought before we got it.  It was!  But it at least didn't taste as inexpensive as the paninis and the bruschetta bread did.  I hate coming on here and writing a review like this for a local business.  But the thing is, we had much higher expectations for the food because it is a wine bar and they are charging a fairly large amount for food that should be using homemade or more high-end ingredients.  I understand they are probably charging more because of the expensive meats and cheeses they are using, but using the cheap bread and jarred artichokes honestly took away from a sandwich that should have tasted more rich.  Don't dumb down the food at a place like this and charge the amount you are charging.    If I do come back, it will only be for the wine.  And please, please, please take down the twinkle lights.  My friend and I enjoyed sitting at the bar and really liked the local art hung on the walls, but the twinkle lights (that had half the strings out and not working) cheapened such a nice place.

Let me preface this by saying I am a frozen yogurt fiend. I don't get to have it enough b/c I didn't realize there was a place closer to me now. I usually go to Yogurtland, which has always been a tasty treat.   Yogurtini looks just as good as Yogurtland does, on a smaller scale. They seemed to have more fruitier yogurt selections, but still a decent range of choices to choose from. My friend is allergic to melon of any sort and when she asked if one of their sorbet's had melon in it, the girl there didn't know. The manager was helpful and quickly found the book they have showing what each yogurt contains. It was very nice and he didn't seem rushed or annoyed by us.  Their range of toppings possibly surpasses Yogurtland in my opinion. They even had a bottle of Sriracha by the other liquid toppings. Apparently, whenever they have mango flavored yogurt, some people like to put the Sriracha on their yogurt just as they would with the real fruit. Interesting!   All in all, I will definitely go back again and try out their other flavors and toppings.

Bare recently opened inside the Vivaldi Salon Suites at Park West. Toni, the owner and esthetician, has offered a complimentary sample service for first time visitors. This was great because I actually needed to get my underarms waxed anyway (this is one of the complimentary services for women). What I loved off the bat is that Bare's website and appointment service was super simple to use. It lists all the prices and menu items that Toni offers as well.  Making an appointment just took 2-3 clicks and sent an automatic reminder email about 2 days before my appointment.  I've been getting my underarms waxed for about 8 years now and have been to plenty of different salons and estheticians. Some have ripped skin off and some have not even plucked the little hairs after waxing while some do. I've paid anywhere between $12 to $25. So, you could say I'm somewhat of an expert on what a good underam waxing should be like.  No really!!    So, let me count the ways about why I loved my experience at Bare today: 1) Toni uses a high end hard wax that works a lot better than sticky wax. 2) Normally, it takes 3-4 applications and rip-offs to get most of my hair removed....which can hurt.  BUT, it only took Toni one time to get the hairs removed. 3) And this is a bigger plus, it didn't hurt at all! I'm serious! The type of wax she uses grabbed on to the hairs so well, that I barely felt it at all. 4) She uses cortisone (as long as you aren't allergic) and witch hazel...both of which get rid of redness and irritation.  5) So, I left feeling like I had nothing done...pain wise. And hours later, I still don't feel any irritation or pain.  All in all, Toni has a great studio and service. Definitely go to her for all your bare needs!

I can never get enough of this place!  I've been known to come here for dinner and get myself the typical gyro and then order a second one for lunch at work the next day.  Be careful and possibly choose to forego onions on your gyro because the tzatziki is insanely flavorful and already sports onions...so you'll have a bit of onion breath the next day if you aren't careful.  LOL  Also, do yourself a favor and get the jalapeno cilantro hummus with homemade pita chips as your side instead of fries or regular hummus!  You won't be sorry and you will certainly thank me later.    Every time I have been in, the owner is running the front register and is insanely friendly.  I love little local spots like this...especially when the food is on point every time and the people who run it are worth it.

I got a to-go order of their perfectly made and delicious Pad Won Sen.  There's so many Thai places that don't really have the spice scale set up and I am glad Chanpen does.  But their mild is more like medium and their medium is more like HOT!  So be forewarned.  This place might be a hole in the wall, but don't let it fool you.  Their dishes are definitely well done and super tasty for sure.  While I was waiting for my order they were also nice enough to give me some bottled water to sip on.  Score a brownie point on the customer service scale!

I would have enjoyed Humble Pie so much more if my initial experience walking through their door hadn't been being talked down to by their hostess.  We were there with several friends for birthday lunch after some ice skating next door.  The place was all but empty, but she wouldn't seat us because we didn't have a reservation and there were 2 large reservations coming in about 2 hours.  So, you can't seat a party of 8 right now because in 2 hours you have two big tables coming in?!  Excuse me?!  We made her seat us anyway and she was all but nice about it.    Once we were past that, our waiter was much much much more friendly, so that saved it along with the yummy food.    We had the tempura friend green beans which were fairly tasty, but not nearly as sumptuous as the french fries topped with parsley, garlic, lemon zest, pecorino cheese, chili flakes and garlic aioli.  They were like eating Lays, once you eat one, you just can't stop.  The pizza was just so so to me though.  Once you eat a place like Pomos downtown, it's hard to think of any other pizza as worthy.

As strange as this review might be, I am completely a fan!    We stopped here near the end of our First Friday night out with friends.  It was insanely packed and so we grabbed a couple chairs in the back corner.  Our waitress was still very accommodating and served us quickly with beer and drinks.  Don't ask me which of the many beers we ordered because I can't remember...  ...Because all I can remember is how insanely divine and delicious our dessert was!  We ordered the salted caramel flatbread that came highly recommended to us by a friend (see my picture I posted, #147).  It is completely homemade on a nice thin crispy flatbread.  Peanut Butter.  Caramel.  Marshmallow fluff.  Chocolate Chips.  Honey.  Pretzels.  If you aren't drooling yet, I feign to say there might be something wrong with your salivary glands or taste-buds.    I want to head back sometime to soon to try their beer, TV dinner night, and enjoy a table with some good friends.  I'm a fan Angels!!

I would normally never give a QT 4 stars, because let's face it.  I'm in love with QT!!    But this one is brand new and for some really strange reason, the builders of this one decided to go against the grain and change the set up.  It is one of the most obnoxious QTs I've ever been in!  The drink stations are split up.  The snacks are spread out in a strange way.  The registers are facing away from the doors.  Even the condiments are in a weird spot.    Why did they have to mess with something that ain't broke?!  Ugh.

Why oh why can't there be one closer to me?!!!!!    I tried Dutch Bros. Coffee for the first time a couple months ago and it was love at first taste and visit.  What's mind-boggling?  There was one of these in my college town all those years I lived there and I wasn't a coffee drinker then...why didn't someone tell me then when it was only 5 minutes away!  The guys working that morning were extremely peppy and hilarious!  Although, I've heard all employees at Dutch Bros. are like this, so that's something I look forward to every time I visit now.  I told them it was my first time there and they proceeded to yell that I was a virgin.  LOLOLOL.  Funniest thing ever.  They also gave me a punch card and punched all the spots so that my next visit would mean a free tasty coffee.  Yes please!!  I tried the iced Bob Marley, which isn't on the regular menu.  It is sort of like the secret items at In 'N Out.  It's basically a banana mocha.  Mmmmm mmmmm goooooooood!  Every time I've ordered it, the person who makes it tells me how much they love it.  So, this is always a good sign!  Try it if you haven't already.   The service, whether it is in the drive thru or walk-up window, is quick but a pleasant experience every single time.  They are faster than any Starbucks I've ever been to (crowded or not crowded) and the coffee is much better.  Basically, if one of these finally comes to my area, it will replace my Dunkin' Donuts go-to for morning coffee.

I was at their opening weekend event with Local First Arizona.    First off...I need the soft pretzel & Provolone Fondue in my life every single day since!  They were so soft and the provolone fondue was creamy and serious perfection! My friend and I accidentally filled up on these and hardly ate any of our entree.  Whoops...but we didn't care, it was sooooo worth it!  And as for the Bacon Bloody Mary I had...well, THAT was something to remember!  I will be coming back just fo the pretzels and the bloody mary.  I'll probably be judged by everyone sitting around me as I scarf the pretzels and wash it down with the BM.  But who cares?!  That being said, I didn't love my entree as much.  I got the shaved prime rib dip.  While the prime rib was cooked and shaved just right, it wasn't something that jumped out at my tastebuds.  My friend had the Italian Grinder and didn't' feel partial to it either.  Neither one of our sandwiches were gross, but they just weren't what we were hoping for.    Loved the bathrooms here!  They are communal and tripped me out for a slit second.  But it was even funnier to watch a man come in as I was getting ready to walk out.  He turned around faster than he could zip his fly up.  He was so embarrassed and thought he had walked in to the women's side.  Hee hee.    I love the atmosphere Culinary Dropout has put together here.  It has this awesome yard vibe but with a modern and stylish fun.  Not sure I'd go here again for an entree.  But I'd love to come back for the pretzels, BM, and to sit outside and take more of the restaurant in.

On a scale of 1-10, how excited was I to stumble upon this place on accident here in Arizona?!  15!!  And while I wish I could fully support a Filipino restaurant in Arizona, I just can't with this one....and for a HUGE reason.  We went here thinking it was Mike's Deli.  But apparently, it is gone and this went in in its place.  A family-owned Filipino restaurant.  I was in heaven and we went in instead of leaving to find another deli.    I ordered their pork lumpia (12 pieces) and their traditional pancit Bihon (I think this was the 2nd word)...two things I grew up absolutely loving when I lived in Mira Mesa (San Diego) surrounded by a ton of my Filiipino friends.  My best friend's mom made the BEST pancit and lumpia and it has been years and years since I have had any. I used to eat it at least once a week. Mmmmmmmmm.   The lumpia was just okay.  The meat wasn't ground up with the veggies, but rather more of a stick of pork wrapped.  Meh.  Reminded me of eating fake crab at a sushi restaurant.  Their sweet chili sauce was perfect though!    Okay, so then, they brought out what I was really really waiting for...my pancit!  When she set it down in front of me, I could already tell I was too excited for absolutely no reason.  There was no color to the noodles.  They looked like they had been taken straight out of the boiling water and placed on my plate.  Rice noodles are supposed to be practically see-through, but these were just as white as they were when they were taken out of the package. There were 2 slices of lemon, chopped carrots, some cabbage...and are you ready for this?  The pieces of chicken looked like they had only been boiled as well as the pieces of shrimp (I've never had traditional pancit with shrimp...so it's a good thing I am not allergic).  No type of seasoning/sauce or anything!  Soooo not traditional to me!  I know there are different regions or versions, but this is certainly not what I am accustomed to eating at my filipino Ate's or Tiya's houses.  I unwillingly squeezed my lemon over it and took a bite.  OMG!  It took everything I had not to spit it out and get up to leave.  It lacked so much flavor it's not even funny.  Well, there was no flavor.  I felt like I was eating lemon flavored noodles.  The chicken was an afterthought and I couldn't even taste it.    How could they?!  I am so upset and annoyed by this.  I am so glad I have had true traditional pansit because if this had been my first taste I would have sworn off the deliciousness of Filipino food for life.    My friend had their chicken adobo and she thought it was just okay.  The chicken was very dry.  I'm sorry to the family who owns this place, but you can't continue serving your customers with such lackluster flavorless food.  No one will want to come here.

While I think it really bites that their original spot had to relocate because a famous place is being torn down for yet another set of luxury apartments, I am SUPER glad that downtown Phoenix gained another fantastic locally owned spot to nosh at!    This is only one of 2 places that is certified (not sure what the term is) as a genuine and authentic Napoletena-style pizza restaurant.  Apparently, it even comes down to the type of marble they use to make their dough on.  Seriously cool!    The owners are from Naples and have definitely brought a taste of Italy to Phoenix.  While we were there, one of the co-owners was in working and walking around. In fact, he brought some of his homemade blend of a creamy Limoncello to us to try and some friend dough.  Talk about a great dining experience!    My friend had the caprese to start with and she loooooved it!  We ordered the margherita pizza which is one of about 3 or 4 genuine Neopolitan pizzas they serve.  Sweet jesus!  The sauce was perfect, the crust was the right consistency (could have done without the overcooked spots in the crust though), and the mozarella was mmmm mmmm good! I ordered what I thought was an appetizer flat bread, but it turned out to be the same size as the pizza (it was super rich...a little too much garlic, but delicious nonetheless).  There was plenty to go around and enough for leftovers to take home too.  For dessert we had their Tiramisu, which my friend boasted as being the best she has had in the valley (and she has tried it every where).  I had their cream puffs that are covered in chocolate mousse.  Wipe the drool off your chin.  Both were fantastic, but I wish I'd have gone with my first instinct and had their Nutella cake after spotting their GIGANTIC jar of Nutella in the kitchen.    I'll definitely be back and bringing other friends with me to try it out AND so I can have that cake!!

By far our favorite spot for Pho and it's just down the street!  It's not much different than Central King Eggroll as far as the food goes...there's a few slight differences in their eggrolls and their meat is slightly thicker than Central King's. Get yourself a P7 (rare beef).  I had some issues with gallstones this last summer before having my gallbladder removed, so I was munching on their P14 (chicken) for awhile and it was just as tasty.  You basically can't go wrong with anything on their menu.    But I can tell you...the actual restaurant and the service is loads better!  We usually have the same waitress and she is someone that always deserves that 20% tip!  Try out their homemade lemonade...they had squeeze it and add a bit of soda water to it so there's a slight fizz to it.  Yum yum!    Each table also has a little button you can press when they are super slammed, but we have seriously never ever had a problem with service here unlike at Central King.  Don't forget either...there is a back room here so if it looks too crowded in the front, don't walk out!    I can literally eat Pho here once a week and still be totally fine!

Woohoo for a locally grown ice cream shoppe!  I haven't had some locally made ice cream since I lived in our small college town in Northern California.    After doing some shopping in the vintage shops around Roosevelt Row and sweating like crazy, my friend and I stopped by Melt.  We had quite a few samples of their sorbets and ice creams including chips and salsa (with Tapatio on top).  The cucumber sorbet was seriously refreshing.  But I ended up with a mini-scoop of Peanut Butter.  My friend also tried their Mexican Hot Chocolate and did say it was too overly spicy.    Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm creamy!  This was seriously dreamy.  Their ice cream, cultivated by Superstition Farms is incredibly creamy, smooth, and perfectly sweet without being too over the top.  All the flavors I tried were very natural and that's a definite plus.    You've got to love their scoops come in Chinese take-out boxes topped with a fortune cookie.  Better yet, if you don't like your fortune, they have a jar full of them you can switch yours out with.  Ha!    We spotted their junk food cookies in their case on the way out and were very curious.  But we asked the girl working that day (who was a bit of an awkward person who didn't listen to us very well) what was in it, but she couldn't even tell us.  Ummmmm, okay?  The cookie was HUGE and looked like it may have been some sort of peanut butter oatmeal concoction with potato chips and pretzels piled on top of it.  I wish I would have grabbed one up to check it out.  Maybe next time!  My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on their large patio area.  It was a nice quiet Sunday and Roosevelt Row makes for a nice relaxing spot to sit in and admire.

The hubs and I went here on Labor Day for dinner after he got off of work and it was still hopping around 8 o'clock!  We grabbed up an order of their green chile queso and fries and...I'm not kidding here...we could have just sat there and ate a couple orders of those and been fully satisfied.  They were freaking delicious and those fries...mmmmmm those fries...perfect!  I had their Buffalo Bill burger:  Bison, Blue Cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Sassy Sauce Hubs had the Llano Poblano:  Angus Beef, Pepper Jack, Hatch Chiles, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Chipotle Mayo  He really loved his and I was sort of sad mine didn't hold more flavor.  Their buns and meat as well as ingredients are on par.  I was just hoping for something that exploded in my mouth like a burger at The Attic would have done.  I do want to try it again and try one of their spicier burgers as well as one of their margaritas when I don't have to drive home late on a school night.

I have never been able to get to Short Leash Dogs' food truck since I am a teacher and can't get out for a lunch break downtown.  So, I was really happy to find out they now have a restaurant!  A large group of my friends and I ate here before heading out to enjoy First Friday.  Supporting a local spot who uses the finest locally made hot dogs and sausages is where it's at.    Their fried pickles are certainly worth an order and perfect for sharing with friends.  Another friend ordered the funnel cakes with chive remoulade and capers...they loved it, while I didn't seem to adjust to the taste combo.  Meh.    I had myself a regular Igby.  Cole slaw. BBQ Sauce. Blue Cheese.  And of course the best thing a hot dog could go in...their flat bread.  I'm not sure why I didn't like this one since all I've ever heard about is how delicious their dogs are.  But I was a bit underwhelmed by this one.  Dang!  Somehow the coleslaw was too well...cabbagey, while the BBQ sauce was not tangy enough.  It overpowered the blue cheese too much.  I was too chicken to try the Bear with peanut butter and cracker jacks.  So, I am going for the Devil Dog next time!  Or I'll possibly create my own, but I don't consider myself a hot dog flavor combo connoseiur and would rather rely on Short Leash's expertise.    If you are a fan of their food truck, definitely step in to Sit...Stay.  Or better yet, if you've been waiting to grab a bite...get in there!    P.S. I did have the pleasure of devouring their sausage stuffed green chiles at the Chile Pepper Festival this year and it was totally tasty!

My friends and I went on their opening weekend to enjoy an afternoon together and support a local business.  This was my first paint-your-own-ceramics experience, but several of my friends have been to the bigger chain places and had a lot to say about them in comparison to Mad Platter.    The women who own Mad Platter are extremely helpful and friendly.  I loved the atmosphere here and their willingness to help us when we had questions throughout our little party and as we were leaving.  Apparently, at other chain places, the workers aren't like this at all.  They sort of give you a quick gist and expect you to sink or float.  This is why I love locally owned spots so much more...there always seems to be better customer service.    They even notified us when they found there was a problem with the firing bisque they were using.  Since they didn't want to ruin our artwork, they notified us that it would take a little longer to fire them but they didn't want to risk ruining our items.  It was just nice to know that they didn't just see us as dollar signs.    My mug turned out fantastically!  I want to go back and do some more pieces.  It was a pleasant experience and I'm glad I chose this place for my "first time".    P.S.  I only wish they would turn down their AC a little bit more.  I was sweating for the first half of my time there.  It was a bit uncomfortable (a downside to locally owned places who can't afford to jack up the AC all day).

I went back again this past weekend to paint and hang out with friends for a girlfriend's birthday party.   We had a fantastic time just like the last!  They allowed us to bring in food and wine to enjoy during our little party as well.    And good news...the AC was turned up just right and it felt fantastic!    They were extremely busy during our 4 hours there, but the two owners were STILL the most helpful and patient people ever.  A couple of us, including myself, needed help with some finishing touches on our items and they were way more than willing to help us out.    We were there right up until closing time and we all felt so bad that we were taking so long, but they still made us feel right at home.    Thanks again Mad Platter!  I will be back very soon.

While this isn't your typical pizza joint, it is definitely worth it for foodies who love interesting pizza and so many other types of food fare.  I've now been twice (it took me forever to write this review) and the second time was even tastier than the first.  The crowd here is relaxed and the atmosphere is one that I can't get enough of...dare I say it is hip?  And not in that annoying hipster way either.  The easiest way for me to get through this review is to list off what we all ate...otherwise the drool will soak this keyboard and I'll never finish.  Honey Ginger Soy Wings: perfectly crispy and flavorful...plenty to go around and share with others too Drewpy Fries:  Don't question this one at all!  If you like fries...get it!  These are not your average cheesy soggy fries you can get at any bar either.  The fingerling potatoes are on par and the prosciutto along with the cheese sauce is to die for! The Hulk (pizza):  I thought this one was just so so.  But this is probably because of the other types we ate overpowered it. The Hottie (pizza):  hot is an understatement!  Prepare to be slobbering with your tongue hanging out, but it's worth it!  The jalapenos and serano peppers make this one hot but the sausage and basil pack a punch of flavor too White Parm and Corn Mac:  I chomped off of a friend's and am not a huge fan of mac and cheese, but this one is definitely tasty and worth a short if you like cheesy goodness Churro-Style Rolled Pizza Dough:  this one was recommended by our waiter after we couldn't decide on what to pick.  It was hot and crispy.  It was by far better than your average churro since it was made from pizza dough and super chocolatey! Coronado Orange Avenue Wit:  A canned beer but nice and refreshing...nice and orangey hefeweizen.  Nothing like Shocktop at all.  We will be back for sure...mostly for the Drewpy Fries and The Hottie pizza!  It's close to the lightrail stop and worth more than one trip to try multiple things from their menu.  They did start out as a food truck a ways back, so they do like to play with interesting ingredients.  Get yourself some!

Thank you Roosevelt Row for putting on such a fun festival this time of year!  This was my first time attending after seeing the fliers when I was at RoRo last weekend shopping at the vintage stores.    While it was smaller than I thought it was going to be, it still had a lot to enjoy.  The vendors were all good.  My husband and my friend decided to each get something different from 3 different vendors, in order to be able to try as much as possible.    The Pasilla Pepper White Bean Chili with the Jalapeno Hush Puppies from Jobot were top notch, sooooooooo good!  We also had Short Leash Dog's super yummy and spicy sausage stuffed poblano pepper with fried jalapenos...those were just as tasty as the chili.  Both were definitely our favorites.  But we also had the green chile mac 'n cheese empanada from AZ Food Crafters, which we thought was just okay...it was a little dry and could have used more cheese or the sauce could have been on the inside instead.  Yet, we enjoyed all of it!    My hubby and friend really loved the Deschutes beers while I thought the pineapple sorano pepper margarita with the 3 Amigos tequila tasted fantastic.  It wasn't spicy but had a really nice flavor to it.  The wooden tokens were a great idea and made it super easy to get drinks throughout the event.  For dessert, we enjoyed the caramels and the chile dark chocolate truffle.  Holy moly!  Both were seriously divine and super spicy.    We wish there would have been more salsa entries.  The mango salsa (wondering who entered this one) was delicious...and I HATE  mango or fruit salsas normally...while the other 3 were really bland and not so fun to eat.  But the idea of it was a lot of fun and we enjoyed it.    The entertainment was spot on as well and we sat in front of the makeshift stage (loved that it was behind one of the RoRo houses) to enjoy the talent show, trivia, and The Senators.    What are the few things I would have changed?  Please add some lights in the portapotty section (we used our iPhone flashlights) and maybe get some more salsa entries for next year.  Oh and maybe add more benches this time around for more seating while eating.    Thanks again Roosevelt Row!  This was an awesome and delicious time!!

The pedicures my bestie and I just got here today were most definitely a treat!  That's exactly why we wanted to try this spot too.  To be able to sit for an entire hour to have someone soak my feet, file them (with some fantastic callous remover), massage house-made lotion slowly into my legs and feet...was phenomenal to say the least!  It wasn't wam-bam-thank-you-ma'am style at all.  The lounge style is very posh and relaxing.  I was afraid the couches you sit on would hurt my back after awhile, but I was quite comfortable the entire time.    We are used to mostly going to the $15 pedicure spots down the street because its simple and cheap.  But that's the problem...the actual pedicure is cheap as can be.  They get you in that chair and kick you out as fast as they can.  I had found Pedicure Lounge next door to my favorite Cajun restaurant one day and then looked it up on Yelp to find pretty great ratings.  It's by appointment only and they book up weeks in advance because of their regulars.  They say walk-ins are available if possible...but it is highly unlikely, unless you can come in during the week in the mornings before people are off work.  Our appointments were at 9am, when they first opened.  When we first came in, the two ladies who had opened the place didn't greet us and let us know they would be with us shortly...so we were slightly put off (hence the 4-stars).  But waiting in the really nice cushy lounge chairs and looking through their high-end colors kept us busy.  We were the only two there the entire time, which was actually quite the treat since we are used to the "super crowded with no AC cheap spots".  By the time we did sit down and get started we were very happy with both of our techs.  They had everything laid out complete with two large steins of real beer for our feet to soak in, lots of towels, house-made products, like their soap and scrub, and sterile items (including some interesting looking unknown feet pads).  This is one of their specialties and while strange, it was fantastic on our feet in addition to their house-made apple soak they poured in.  With the beer, this turned it into a very lovely smelling treat for our feet (our techs said it was to mimic Redd's Apple Ale).  Mmmmmmmm.  I was just about to take a picture of all the things laid out when my tech reached over and poured my beer out into the foot sink.  Dang it!  I loved that they did one foot at a time instead of whipping my feet out back and forth and yanking on me.  The unknown foot pads were actually for the callouses.  They left these on for quite a long time and then used very gentle foot files.  We were sadly amazed at how easily they were able to file our feet without using harsh looking files (that we are used to).    The foot and leg massages were absolutely amazeballs because they took their time, used perfect pressure, and really really focused on our feet too.  The amount of time and care they took with putting our polish on in two very thick and full coats along with the perfect amount of top coat was quite nice.    We loved the place and want to come back for sure.  It will be interesting to see how long the polish lasts in comparison to our cheapy places.  I can't wait to come back.  During the weekdays, you can call a few days ahead of time to make an appointment.  FYI:  If you are a first time customer, you have to put a $30 deposit down in case you don't show up for the appointment.  They apply it towards your service.    The service is fantastic and I felt like they really want to give that nice experience.  Other than the initial no greeting or acknowledging us when we were there waiting...I am totally happy with Pedicure Lounge!  It sounds like no one set up their stations for them the day before, so they had to try to get it all ready while we were waiting, which is understandable...just with they would keep in mind they could tell us that and we wouldn't have a problem waiting.    I'll be back in a few weeks or so Pedicure Lounge!  Thank you for the relaxing experience!

Who can resist a southern style joint with that friendly feel, tasty chicken, and sweet tea?!  Raising Cane's is always hopping...think In 'n Out on it's busy afternoons.  Every time, you are warmly greeted by almost everyone who works there and they address you by name (after getting it from you at the counter).    Their famous sauce definitely makes it.  I've been a couple times now and only one time did I get dry chicken.  The other visits were made of juicy chicken strips!  You get a lot of food even if you only order their 3-piece, so be cautious of The Box with chicken, coleslaw, fries, and toast.    Try out their sweet tea or order yourself a lemonade (you have to ask when you order since the lemonade isn't out for you to get yourself).

This took the place of Native New Yorker in our neighborhood.  While I truly love supporting and eating at local establishments, this one just doesn't stand out enough to me.  Sure, it's a bar with American food.  But there is nothing spectacular that tops other places I've been to.    I can tell you they definitely improved the atmosphere and inside since Native New Yorker completely missed the mark when they knocked the wall down.  They have a small stage that must host local talent on some nights.  There are two huge pull-down screens and projectors as well as many other TVs set around the restaurant.    I had their hot wings which were pretty tasty...but I was flicking the sauce all over myself because they were a little too tough on the outside.  My hubby had one of their burgers and also liked it but just thought it was average.  We may or may not go back since it is a nice local spot.  After all, they have a nice selection of beers on tap.

So okay...no this isn't my most favorite pizza in the valley.  It isn't gourmet or anything.  But having ordered it for our elementary school's parties and then a random lunch break where we didn't have time to head out and get anything...this seriously hits the spot for the cheap pricetag!  The pizza is more of a thinner handtossed type crust and slices are large.  Yummy!  I have now tried their classic cheesesteak and no it isn't genuine or anything along those lines...but dang it, it too hit the spot and was tasty.    The only thing I wouldn't recommend is their salads.  They are huge but not very good.  Stick to the pizza and cheesesteaks.  I'd like to try their other things like wings and other apps though.

Prepare to be schooled on what BBQ really is and what it always should be when you step into Little Miss BBQ.  Smoked with real wood.  Salt and pepper.  Simple sides. Low heat.  Your search for the real thing outside of Texas will finally be over!  It is true central Texas style BBQ right in the middle of Arizona.  Forget Famous Dave's and even Bobby Q's.    Don't be fooled by the quirky location because it is an oasis in the middle of an industrial area and seedy strip joints.  Scott and Bekke (and Travis, their assistant pitmaster) have really created a place where everything about the BBQ community come together.  They took their expertise from traveling around Austin and several of their famous BBQ spots, like Franklin's, and brought it smack dab to the middle of a place that needed it.   I've been 3 times now and it gets better with every visit.  Get there between 11-11:30 so you won't miss out on anything.  On each visit, they have been making more and more food though.  But you know what?...there's just something about getting there early and lining up for what I can guarantee will be well worth your time. Plus?  The line moves fast anyway! LMB are the nicest set of people and love what they do.  Ask them anything and they'll gladly give you the time of day.  Good service and delicious food?!  Yes please!!  Buy it by the pound or get yourself a two-meat plate, or the El Jefe (brisket, sausage, coleslaw, house sauce sandwich).  Here's a run down of what I've shoveled into my mouth:  Brisket - Scott lets you choose the lean or fatty side of the brisket and you will get a melt-in-your-mouth sample too!  Has an insane smoke ring on it.  Bark is flavorful.  Pork Ribs - Nice and peppery...Includes the short rib too!  Pork - Mild smokey flavor and the perfect combination of juicy and tender  Sausage - Made in-house with a slight kick and perfectly juicy too.  Did I mention I usually hate sausage?  I couldn't get enough of this!    Beef Belly - LMB's special on Wednesdays, beefy and tender.  Definitely try it out.  Jalapeno Cheese Grits - creamy, cheesy, and the right kind of kick...never have I EVER wanted to touch grits before, but these come highly recommended by LMB, so I tried it and brought home a pint during this last visit.  Mmmmm mmmmm goooooood!  Coleslaw - Best I've ever had...this has a tang to it and is nothing like the icky mayonnaise-based stuff served everywhere else  Potato Salad - Red potatoes and the right amount of everything.  Complete opposite of the mushy stuff you get at delis  Beans - Includes brisket.  Did you hear me?  It has brisket in it!!  Spicy and oh so delicious with a smoky taste to it.  No clue what is in it, but does it even matter?!  Get some!  If you aren't wiping drool off your little iPhone or keyboard right now, then perhaps knowing they also have pastrami on Thursdays, beef short ribs (of the Flintstone variety) on Fridays and Saturdays, and even Pot de Creme on occasion for dessert will make your salivary glands realize what they are missing out on!  Go. Get. You. Some!!!!

I have two words for you...House Margarita!  They are a must have.  Yes, they are $10, but there's a reason for it!  They are insanely tasty and even more insanely potent.  Be prepared...they seem harmless when you first start sipping on one.  But once you get to the bottom you are not going to be in the right frame of mind.  In fact, you'll want to order a second one and when you start drinking that one, well...you'll realize you probably should have stopped with the first!  Being picky with my Mexican food in this area (I'm a SD baja style fan) I actually didn't find theirs too bad at all.  Their salsa is nice and chunky but with a good amount of flavor.  Not at all bland like so many of the other spots and restaurants around the valley I've tried.  Both times I've been, I have ordered the Burrito Verde, and have not been disappointed.  It's easily shareable or good for leftovers.  It is filled with pork in a mild green sauce and topped with my favorite...tomatillo sauce.  Mmmmmmm good!    Did I mention the house margaritas yet?

To say I am excited to finally have Changing Hands closer to me is an understatement.  The west valley is in major need of so many Indie businesses and thank goodness we have an Indie bookstore in the 'hood.  I was beyond nervous when I first donated money for the opening of this location and there mere days before it ended and several thousand were still needed.  But the community came through and from there I eyeballed the countdown like nobody's business!    My friend and I went to their opening night and we were not let down at all.  The parking lot was plenty big enough to fit everyone and the open space the bookstore is in has that warehouse feel to it complete with the 2 original fireplaces from Beefeaters.  The First Draft Book Bar is a very welcome addition to this location and I'm pretty sure I will be the owner of one of the bar glasses and T-shirts!  There is a large open space right behind the bar that looks to possibly be the spot for all the author visits and signings.  They won't have to move any bookshelves!  I can't wait!...especially since I was nervous they wouldn't host any events at our Phoenix location when I first heard it was going in.  Thankfully, they will start hosting events here in August (they held off not knowing if they would be open by then).  In fact, last night I preordered my book to see Damien Echols!  They have a restaurant attached and will soon have a garden store as well.    I'm now the proud owner of 3 books from the opening night and several photos to remember the nice evening at Changing Hands.  They have all the bookshelves I loved at their Tempe location...like top listed books.  But I especially love their Upcoming Events shelf because my favorite part of Changing Hands is their local events.  And just like at their Tempe location...they sell all the fun quirky gifts and stationary items.  The Phoenix location is nothing short of perfect.  My only gripe was that it was too hot last night and they need to pump up the AC a little bit more...especially with all the windows in the two front walls.  Other than that...I will be visiting my local Indie bookstore a lot more now that it is within normal driving distance!  This could be super dangerous.

Why oh why couldn't this be closer to me?!  Perhaps it's safer this way.  I can't trust myself not to come every single morning before heading to work.  As always, the peeps here are super friendly and high energy.  This is something I'll never get tired of at any Dutch Bros.  Plus?  They make mean coffees.  Since I do not live close enough to grab coffee in the morning and not be late to work, I like to now get a cold pour of my fav, Bob Marley (Kokomo with banana), toss it in the fridge for the night, and pop ice in it the next morning.  Perfection!

I can't.  I just can't.  This place will not be around for long if the owner does not figure out the true meaning behind a local restaurant.  I don't write very many 1-star reviews unless my experience was truly horrible (see for yourself by checking out my stats).    My 3 foodie friends and I came here around 6:30 and the place was almost empty.  Bad sign number 1.    Our waiter started apologizing for their poor paper menu and that it was because they were still testing out dishes...8 weeks after opening their doors.  I get that, I do.  But this wouldn't have been so essential to my dining experience if not for everything else you'll read here.  Bad sign number 2.  One of my girlfriends ordered the sweet potato fries right off the bat and another got their jalapeno poppers.  As soon as the fries were passed by my face to my friend, I immediately knew they were extremely bad.  They looked beyond done...almost burnt to a crisp.  I can't even believe they were served.  The chef or owner or even the waiter should have stopped them right at the kitchen door.  Sweet potato fries shouldn't be brown.  She did ask for them to be taken back, very politely actually.  Bad sign number 3.  The vibe of this place is pub-like or almost like a brewery.  Even the menu had a pub type of fare.  Yet, there was a Sriracha Lime Tilapia dish as well as some gourmet sounding bruschetta.  Hmph.  Interesting, weird really.  We ordered our food:  my sweet potato fry friend got her Beer Citrus shrimp, another got the bruschetta and an order of the mixed chips, while my jalapeno popper friend got fish 'n chips and I got their tilapia.  The first two dishes came out fairly quickly.  But my friend immediately said the citrus dip wasn't citrusy at all and my other friend made a face as she told us the bruschetta bread was downright gross.  It was not toasted and had a weird taste...doesn't sound like bruschetta to me.  Her mixed chips weren't mixed and were insanely greasy.  There was actually a pool of grease at the bottom of the basket/bowl.  Bad sign number 4, 5, and 6.    My other friend and I continued to wait for our dishes for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes.  Suddenly, I felt sick to my stomach (fairly certain it was from the one jalapeno popper) and I don't blame this on the restaurant at all.  TMI, but this is necessary information for bad sign number 100 below.  The waiter brought out a plate of fries and ketchup and told us he wanted us to munch on something while we waited.  He didn't exactly apologize for the wait or anything though.  None of us ate them because we were starting to get grossed out by the food at this point.  Our food finally came out about 20 minutes later.  The cod were very small (for $12) and my tilapia didn't look appetizing at all (for $12 or $14).  Sort of a bad presentation.  But I didn't eat it because I didn't want to tempt fate with my stomach.  So, I asked our waiter if I could have a box...not telling him it was because of an upset stomach, he didn't need to know about that.  He never brought it out...bad sign...I lost count of bad signs by this time.    Ten minutes later, a man silently walked up to our table and proceeded to stand above us and just stare.  My cod friend and I stopped our conversation after about a minute and looked up at him.  He didn't say anything, just stared. So, finally 1 of us inquired why he was there.  He awkwardly asked if we needed anything else in the most condescending and rude way.  I was uncomfortable and felt insanely unwelcome.  I told him I needed a box for my food.  I don't know if he assumed it's because I wasn't happy with my food or what, but he walked away rolling his eyes and scoffing.  Excuse me?!  What in the hell?!  I would have got up and walked out right then and there without paying if I had driven my own car.  It only got weirder from there.  I continued to watch the owner go to a couple other tables smiling and being somewhat friendly.  What did we exactly do to this guy to make him be so rude to us?  We weren't being rude at all.  But we do know he was aware there was some unhappiness happening at our table.    Throughout all of this, the waiter hardly ever came over and the manager/owner never really did come over to apologize for the poor service, mistakes made on the food, nothing!    I am a HUGE supporter of local restaurants and love them to death!  But with poor service like this and poor food, this place should NOT be in business.  I see a lot of reviewers love the beer selection and the owner seems to be very knowledgeable and friendly about those beers.  So, maybe he should open a microbrewery or something along those lines since the whole food part seems to make him unhappy and cranky.  You can't treat customers like this and expect us to return or spread a good word about you.  Customer service is number 1 and they have a TON to improve on.  I will NEVER return!

Well....the chocolate pudding was good!    This place has a lot of hype surrounding it and despite being an enormous fan of the Austin style BBQ joint in Phoenix, Little Miss BBQ (see my review and all the other 5-star reviews surrounding it), I was willing to give it a shot.    The line didn't bug me and I was ready to wait knowing this is how Texas style BBQ is, but just know you will wait a bit because of the way they slice and serve their food.  My hubby and two friends and I grabbed one of the metal buckets and filled it with yeasty beverages while we waited.    Let me just preface this entire review now (as if the first sentence didn't already cover it)...I have two simple words to describe it.  Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland. Dry. Bland.  Does that about cover it?  We decided on half a pound each of the pork spare ribs, fatty brisket, and one house made jalapeno sausage along with some coleslaw, beans, and chocolate pudding.  The coleslaw was insanely bland.  What am I talking about?!  The entire tray of meat was everything but flavorful.    As soon as they put the ribs on our tray, I turned to my husband and asked him, "What the heck is that?"  It was gray and looked like cardboard.  The fatty brisket they laid down was a lousy excuse for fatty brisket.  As a brisket expert, my husband realized their "fatty brisket" is actually the lower part of the point, which is dry and normally chopped and served on sandwiches because it isn't pretty and it certainly isn't fatty.  The link looked hopeful though.  I totally dug the hot carrots!!!    So, Texas BBQ is supposed to not require any sauce at all.  But this stuff had to be doused in it!  I had to bathe my meat in it for goodness sakes.  There was absolutely no flavor to any of the meat and no seasoning (and by that I mean salt and pepper) in sight.    Never will I ever go back to Rudy's.  And I am NOT just writing this subpar review because of LMB...I honestly and truthfully was grossed out and extremely let down by the appearance, taste, and lackluster flair of their food. Sure Little Miss BBQ is a bit more of a drive, but their meat is juicy, flavorful, and doesn't require any sauce whatsoever.  Their sides are tasty too.

This place is right across the way from Flavors of Louisiana...and that equals fantastic in my book!  We walked over from dinner to grab a nice cold treat.  The best part?  They serve it Hawaiian style with ice cream on the bottom.  It was divine.  It didn't make a mess either...because the ice was packed so nice and tight.  There are several ice cream choices and a ton of syrup flavors to choose from.  Caution...get their small if you aren't sharing it with anyone because the medium is HUUUUUUUUGE!!

I loved the movie reveal!!  FilmBar is already one of my favorite spots downtown and so this was a BONUS! It reminds me of my favorite Indie theater I used to go to all the time in college. Being able to see Wayne's World...a movie whose lines I used to have almost completely memorized...was EXCELLENT! I'm fairly certain almost all of us broke into song during Bohemian Rhapsody. Each time I've been to FilmBar I enjoy seeing the different local art pieces and sampling local brews. I really hope to be able to come to the rest of these secret Arizona films too. Thanks again for an awesome time Lindsey!

My friend and I went when it first opened and I wasn't impressed with their specialty rolls.  It was in the wintertime too, so they had their heater blasting...so we were burning up.  We actually had to ask them to turn it down...funny though, because I was thinking of how the scantily clad waitresses were probably freezing.  Ha!  Our favorite roll out of the few we ordered was the unique Honda Roll, which had super thin slices of lime on top.  It added a really nice little flavor flare to the roll, which would have actually lacked flavor.

We went here on a whim last night for Taco Tuesday...but ended up absolutely loving the Hoppy Hour and craft beer!  The patio tables were perfectly relaxing in this nice spring weather.  It was steady and busy.  I don't know how I missed this place when I lived here a year ago.  SMH.  Back home in San Diego, Mira Mesa to be exact, where craft breweries really took off running...I'm used to the super good stuff like Ballast Point.  So, I came here hoping for the best.  It did not disappoint!  I absolutely loved love loved the IFR Nitro (Oatmeal Stout).  We also drank several of the ales (like Hop Snob and Chase the Tail) and loved those just as much.  Their tacos for the Tuesday special are only $3 each.  You can choose from chicken, pork, or beef.  The pork was our favorite because of tasty pineapple salsa, which I usually hate!  The chicken was so so because it was a little dry...but if you ask for extra sriracha ranch, it's good to go!  I didn't have the beef taco, but our friend did and he liked that one the best.  Apparently, they change the toppings for the beef taco from week to week.    We also had their apple fritter dessert and basically scarfed it down in a matter of minutes...so no going wrong there if you try it!!

I came into Ignite on Black Friday for their special...2 weeks for $10...and did their complimentary BF practice as well.  Basically...I was hooked from the get go!  The studio itself is insanely cozy and kept at a nice temperature so that you get warmed up quickly without breaking right into a sweat.  That comes a few minutes later.    I've now practice with 3 yogis there and every single one of them is incredible at what they do.  They are very knowledgeable and know exactly what to do when it comes to coming over and helping you move into a pose or use props to go deeper into poses or stretches.    In the week I've been going, I've already learned a whole lot more than I did at my local gym.  I can already see more progress.  The restorative yoga is especially amazing because of all the props that are available.  I never thought it would be my thing, but Ignite has done an amazing job at making a place for everyone of all levels and wants.    My favorite part of all is the use of the essential oils at the end of each practice while we are all laying in savasana.  The oils are actually made by Eva's (the owners) mom locally.  They smell fantastic and really make me sink that much deeper into my relaxation.    Their tea bar also has some very delicious local teas as well as some locally made wares.  Definitely check it out before or after your practice.  Ignite has my vote!

A group of 5 of us went for my belated birthday and were grouped with about 4 other ladies who were there for a girl's night out.  We got locked in the apartment room.  At first we were all over the place and everyone was trying to find clues separately.  But as we started to unlock the padlocks and began to need those specific clues, we worked more and more together.  Once we got down to the last 2 or 3 clues, we joined up strangers and all and it was a really fantastic time!  Having that screen and being able to get the hints fast was a really neat part of the whole escape experience as well.  One of my friends had to use the restroom in the middle of the escape, but we figured we were locked in for good.  As she was saying she had to go out loud, we noticed someone was "yelling" at her on the screen to just open the door because it's unlocked...it cracked us up.  It was like being in Little Brother.    The price is a little high, but for the fun of teaming up with strangers and friends it was worth it at least once.  We thankfully made it out with only 2.5 minutes to spare!

We came here during the intermission at the nearby AMC for the Oscars Viewing, which means we only had about an hour to make it back for the next movie.  I'm not sure why other people keep saying that the food came out very slowly because we definitely didn't have that experience, thank goodness.  I ordered the Some Like It Hot and found the waffle concept to be a perfectly nice addition to a burger.  We had a couple beers with our meal out on the patio and it was perfection.  The owner and possibly the manager came by and both asked us how things were tasting and if they could do anything else for us.  He had mentioned they wanted to make sure they continued to make the experience better.  It had only been about a month after the Super Bowl and so they wanted to work on all the kinks that they noticed had happened during that time.  If you like to try to new and unique foodie experiences, I definltely recommend you check it out.  I for sure want to come back for a sweet treat.

Being a loyal fan of their original Avondale location, I definitely was excited to find out they were opening a kiosk at Westgate on May 1!  I finally went on Sunday, a couple days after they opened, to see how they put it all together.  Not only do they have single container cupcakes, but they also sell different assortments of chocolate covered bacon, their cheesecakes and pies, as well as some cakepops, 4-pack assortments of cupcakes, and drinks.  It is a simple little space that is a lovely extension of the original.  I was sad to see they didn't have my favorite of all time, Peanut Butter Sugar Cookie...on the other hand, this might be a good thing, since I only live 5 minutes away.  They are missing some of my other favorites though, so I see myself continuing to go to the Avondale location way more.  I'm hoping they will switch it up here and there and change the assortment they stock in the kiosk.    I'm so happy for the Cartwright's and their expansion.  Now so many more people will get to taste the wonderfulness I've so enjoyed these last couple years!

We went here on a double date night with some good friends who are also foodies, to celebrate the last day of school.  The parking lot was small but as soon as we walked in to the lawn area we were in awe of just the space itself!  Ocotillo's menu is small but packed with quite a flavorful punch with crazy but super delicious combos.    To start with, the four of us started with 3 "Small" (one was vegetables) plates.  I wish I could remember all of them, but they do change out items fairly often and the menu doesn't have all the same items as when we were there about a month ago.  One was a salmon dish with super super thinly sliced salmon.  The Crispy Chicken Meatballs were to die for with crispy coconut on the outside and the green curry sauce added a nice tang as well.  The Pecan Wood Smoked Beets were a surprise for me.  I'm just not a beets fan at all and had only ever had the canned slimy grossness at Thanksgiving.  But these were simply divine with the pistachios and ricotta.    Then, we ordered 3 of the large plates.  I wasn't as fully impressed with my dish, the Crispy Whole Fish for two.  I'm not one to enjoy my dinner looking at me and this one came with the head and eyes still right there...staring at me.  But the presentation was definitely on pointe.  At the time, it came with the most buttery tasting brown rice (except it was coconut oil I think).  My friends each got the Pork Shank, which was HUGE, and super juicy and then the Ocotillo Chicken.  It's fairly new to the neighborhood and well worth a visit!  Go with friends so you can share multiple dishes and flavors.

Officially a stalker of Portillo's.  Officially.  My friend, who is a Chicagoan, brought me here a couple weeks ago to pop my Chicago Dog cherry.  It was completely and utterly worth the drive!    I am a fairly plain hot dog type of person...ketchup, mustard, relish, that's it.   But I am one of those when in Rome type folks.  So, I went balls to the wall and got the full on Chicago dog with all the toppings.  Tomatoes. Pickle.  Green relish. Sport peppers. Onions. Steamed poppy seed bun.  BEST HOT DOG EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!  These aren't anything like stadium hot dogs, Wienerschnitzel dogs, or those hot dogs that have buns that fall apart at family barbeques.  No siree bob.  I only wish I would have ordered two.  They make a mean Arnold Palmer.  Having to wipe the drool off my keyboard here.  I shared an order of their cheese fries with my friend as well.  Their fries are of the crinkle variety and are in no way soggy or lacking in flavor.  Perfectly salty.  Perfectly crispy.   Mmmmm mmmmm goooooood.  I could lick that cup of cheese sauce clean well after the fries are gone too.   I've already been back for a second trip (only 2 weeks later) and had myself their Italian Beef dipped with hot peppers.  While it was also tasty, I am most definitely a Chicago Dog kind of gal.  This time, I also had their famous chocolate cake.  At first glance, this slice of cake looks like something like that would make the roof of your mouth stick to your tongue.  But it is moist, not too overly sweet, it's perfectly chocolatey, and I didn't even need a glass of milk to go with it.  Apparently, they use mayonnaise in their batter.    I WILL be back for more and I am completely in trouble if a Portillo's makes its way out to the west valley...but I wouldn't be torn up if it did either.

Originally, I am from San Diego and so I know some really fantastic Baja style Mexican food when I taste it (not just see it).  Now, I know that I now live in the Sonoran Mexican food area and I won't find my beloved Baja style easily in this state.  But, let me just say this...after trying about 10 places around Phoenix, I have finally found a place that is almost as delicious as SD style food!  Their Machaca burritos actually have scrambled egg mixed in just like back home and it isn't as greasy as Sonoran style.  I've also tried their chicken taquitos and they use white meat, which is delicious.  Their salsa bar has some of the best salsa I've tried around here...it isn't as chunky as Baja style salsa, but it tastes a lot better than some of the runny stuff I've had at places such as Popo's in Phoenix.  And what was that?!  Yep!  They have one of my all-time favs from back home...hot carrots!  Not only do they have them, but they taste almost exactly the same way they do in San Diego.    Okay okay, so I kept talking about food in San Diego...but honestly, it took my husband and I 5 years of living here to finally locate a place that has delicious and authentic food that is both Baja style and Sonoran style.  Love it!  Thank you Senor Taco for being here.  No, seriously.
