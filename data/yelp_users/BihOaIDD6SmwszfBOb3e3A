Love the Mexican Chocolate Cinnamon Latte!!! Breakfast is always phenomenal. Service is always friendly and well paced. Price is on point for the area. Great little spot in the art district!

This is just my kind of place!!! It is hidden and dark and cozy. The food is ridiculously good... and this coming from a girl that doesn't really care for Mexican or New Mexican food!! It is the perfect place to take the men in your life. Guys always seem to love this hole in the wall gem.   Often times there is a wait, as the place is small, but it is well worth it. More often than not we squeeze up to the bar to grab our brunch and end up making friends with everyone sitting around us. I think that is the #1 reason why I love this place... it reminds me of being back home in New Orleans!

As the name implies... EVERYTHING here is D'lish!!! From the breakfast sammies to the Man Salad to the Breakfast Buzz, I have never been disappointed with the food!!! I do suggest going to the drive-thru, as it can get very loud inside. Plus, the restroom facilities aren't the most accommodating. But the staff is always laid back, friendly and efficient. I do love the Tempe location but it is a little to far from my 'hood but if you are in that area, I definitely suggest making breakfast or lunch there a regular thing... as I do at the Scottsdale location!

Great Happy Hour everyday! Love this place. Probably my favorite place for sushi in Scottsdale. Def. the best happy hour. But I did take one star because they desperately need to update their menu. For months now there are incorrect items...including last night when I ordered the Tempure Ice Cream only to find out they no longer use Chocolate & Peanut Butter ice cream but they now use Chocolate & Banana. Same with the drink menu. Not a huge deal...just a little annoying.

I *heart* EVERYTHING about Sweet Republic!!! And I am even more pleased to see that they are now supplying their delicious ice cream flavors to Whole Foods!!   The staff is always friendly, even when I have shown up at 2 minutes til closing. The ice cream always tastes amazing and the flavors are out of this world! The Campfire S'more Sundae is just to die for. And they have Bacon Brittle that I dream about constantly... so much in fact, I will be giving it as stocking stuffers for the holidays this year ;)

The bartender Addison is a real asshat. Couldn't be more of a douche if he tried. Trust me, there are a lot of idiots running around Arcadia. But he takes the cake.

The entire staff at Verde Salon was very pleasant and helpful. But Marianne and Stephanie went above and beyond to make me, and more importantly, my teenage daughter feel more than comfortable. My daughter had an initial consultation, for a pixie cut, with Marianne. That went well... so we followed up with an appointment the following Monday.  Marianne did an amazing job of not only listening to what my daughter wanted but also making her feel special and beautiful. Stephanie, the owner, was very gracious and encouraging as well. They both made my daughter feel confident and secure in her decision to cut her hair extremely short. And anyone with an awkward teenage girl can tell you that is often no easy task! Plus, Verde is organic and cruelty-free which is exactly what my daughter was looking for in a salon. We had a great experience and have already pre-booked our next appointment. Keep Up The Great Work Ladies!!!

I recently signed up for BYC's 30 days for $30...it was amazing!!! The studio is very clean and organized, with very accommodating restrooms that included showers stocked with shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hair dryers, deodorant, etc...you name it...they got it!!   The instructors are all friendly and helpful. By far my favorite is Emily :) She is sweet and encouraging. She pushes you with positive reenforcement and a smiling happy face (instead of barking orders like some instructors tend to do) and she is always willing to give extra instruction after class.    My only complaints would be that the schedule is very thin and they use carpet in the classroom. With only an average of 4 classes a day...none of which are in the midday...it can be tricky making it in with my schedule. As for the carpeting, it really is my biggest turn off. I'd much rather hard surface floors that can be mopped after ever class. In Bikram Yoga classes EVERYONE sweats!!! I don't relish in the thought of any part of my body (even my feet) touching someone else's puddle of sweat. Or smelling a mildew smell when lying in face down savasana. Carpet just doesn't seem as sanitary as it could be.   Overall I enjoyed my experience at BYC. And I will most likely be back for practice in the future.

I love this place! It is my favorite of all the Four Peaks locations... By far! I am so sad to hear that it is no longer open to the masses as a bar... But instead for tours of the brewery only.

Love this place! Healthy meals that taste amazing!! My only real complaint is the chaos that tends to occur on Saturday and Sunday, especially in the morning. Their system for calling out your order has something to be desired and the waiting/ordering line can get crowded and at times claustrophobic. For that reason, and the outdoor "yard" area, I prefer the Tempe location but it is something I can definitely overlook considering how much I enjoy everything else at the Old Town location.

I adore this place! The food is always fresh, the cocktail & wine selection is amazing, the decor is romantic yet playful and the service is always on par. The happy hour is one of my favorite in Old Town. A must try!!!

Came here on a Thurs night with friends for Happy Hour. We arrived at 5:45 (as proof via our texts alerting each other we had arrived), we sat at a table to the rear of the bar. We sat and waited a while...watching our waitress walk by numerous times. When she finally got to us we ordered drinks and asked for Happy Hour food menus. Once again we waited...and wait. She finally arrived with our drinks & we were ready to order but she dropped of our drinks and hurried away despite our attempts to give her our food order. After watching her walk past our table again & again we FINALLY flagged her down to place our order...only to be told "Happy hour ended 5mins ago" :( We tried to reason with her but she pretty much blew us off stating there was nothing she could do. Fine! We ordered anyway. But after sitting there stewing for a minute we decided to speak to the Manager. The only reason, I gave 2 stars is due to the manager being so gracious and accommodating. He gladly gave us HH pricing once we explained the situation. Thinking that now the waitress would surely be more attentive considering that we had spoken to her manager but NOPE!! Our service only got worse. While she was polite, she was just very absent minded and oblivious to things like empty cocktails.   The food was mediocre at best. The smothered fries were great but everything else was greasy (not in the good way) and bland. Such a disappointment cause I was really excited about the menu.   In addition to the bad service and blah food, we thought it was odd that it was Football Season and they didn't have the NFL game on the big screen...instead of a loop of advertisements for the bar. We finally left to go watch the game elsewhere.

I mean what can I really say about Portillo's that hasn't already been said a million times over?!?! If you are looking for greasy, cheesy, grilled, salty GOODNESS...then Portillo's is the place for you! This is my ultimate cheat meal destination!!! I always get the Bacon Burger, Chili Cheese Fries, and the Chocolate Cake Shake...I can never finish it all...but I am NEVER disappointed!
