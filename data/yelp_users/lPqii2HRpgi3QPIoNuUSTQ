I've been looking for a great Deli, the kind that you find in NYC or Chicago. I can't believe it took me a while to discover this place, but so glad I did. I stopped in for a sandwich and walked out a fan. They have more selections than you need and things I've never even heard of before.   I believe it's run by a mother/son team, with the mother having a nice Polish accent, so you get the feeling she's curing meats like back in the old country.   Looking forward to going back and sampling some new things and getting the stand-by's, of which will inevitably be better than what can be bought at grocery store counters.   If you miss the authenticity of deli's from the place your grew up or have a bit of envy from those travel shows watching the hosts gorge themselves on great deli meats from famous places, this is our solution here in Phoenix.

I'm sure like most people, we go to the cleaners that happens to be nearby. So for me, the one nearby was fine enough over the years, but no longer. I dropped some items off recently and 3 of them came back with what could only be described as oily spots.   I spoke with the manager, told them that not only was this not acceptable, but I wasn't going to pay for them and wanted them to redo. They said they tried their best and what's done is done. A store credit was given, but this does not make up for the fact that the pieces are ruined.   They told me that the material is difficult to work with and this happens often. My response was that if they knew the material was sensitive, why did they bother in the first place. I would have been much better off it they told me this up front so I could have not had them done or known before hand to risk it.   I will now be taking my business elsewhere to the other cleaners around the other corner.

I've been to Rinaldi's several times now. To me, it's one of those places that after the first bite, I get annoyed at myself for not remembering how disappointing it was the last time and wonder why I'm back.  Let's cut to the chase. This place in essence is really no different than the deli counter at the low end food store down the street from wherever it is you live - and let's be honest, places like Safeway make a point of a good deli counter and put this place to shame - all at a lower cost.  Don't be fooled by the quintessential "New York" decor on the walls such as a photo of downtown NYC and a poster of Italian movie mobsters. I lived in New York and this is not a real NY deli. This place wouldn't make it through opening weekend.  2 slices of deli meat on a thin bed of shredded lettuce, and a layer of mayo on a crumbly hoagie roll does not transport me back to Mulberry St.   The two stars are awarded to their breakfast burritos. It's pretty hard to mess up eggs.

A haven for craft brew lovers. Papago is a great place when you're in the mood for great beer. Unlike other "brew pubs" like Four Peaks, which really only serves their own beers, Papago has an endless selection of bottled and draft beers from many different breweries, with only a small handful being their own. There's a couple obligatory TV's and the standard bar food like pizza and nachos, but you're not really going there for the food. It's all about the beer.

Have been going to the old location and just checked out the new place (right next door) a couple days back.   Definite improvement. The problem with the old location was size and that has definitely been resolved with the new place having tons of tables and good elbow room.   The coffee is good and the whole place has a great "roasting" aroma. I could even see some beans being attended to in a side room.   The wi-fi is free and this is a great answer to those who are sick of the other chain places.   The only issue I noticed was that it can get a little cramped at the counter, where the orders are taken and drinks delivered several minutes later. Not a real issue - just needs a little adjustments.

I find LGO to be a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde type of place, so I will give a review with equal parts duality. In the end though, I'm going to go against the overwhelming positive grain and give it two stars for reasons below.   The Food  Mr. Hyde Says - This place seems to be two different types of restaurants. There's the breakfast/brunch servings and then there's the alternate menu, which consists of salads and their eponymous pizzas. For what it's worth, I've been here many times, more than I cared to, but my girlfriend used to live within walking distance, so it was too convenient to counter with any convincing argument against going. Of the many visits for breakfast, I've just felt underwhelmed by the food. The egg dishes, crepes, etc always leave me feeling unsatisfied and find they lack a bit of punch in the flavor department. For what it's worth, they're going for a French flare to the cuisine, but it still always seems to under deliver.   Dr. Jekyll Says - On the contrary, the non-breakfast foods are quite good. The salads and the pizzas are really good, freshly made and what you would expect from an "artisanal" pizza place. Additionally, they have a solid beer and wine list.   The Brick And Mortar  Mr. Hyde Says - This place, specifically during the breakfast hours, is a disaster and would make any Retail Operations manager cringe at the lack of flow before them. You line up at one station to order food and pay. You line up at another station to order coffee and pay. There's no table service. You have to order your food, all the while, scout for the random table opening, while also keeping a watchful eye out for your food to make sure you claim it before it goes cold. And, to top it off, this entire place also operates as what most people think is a really cute market, full of curios that other people call junk. Mr. Hyde believes that this market only adds to the utter chaos and lack of flow for the restaurant. It would be different if it was off to the side, but smack in the middle of everything yields chaos.   Dr. Jekyll Says - Avoid breakfast and go for dinner, where you can have great salads, pizzas and actually be seated at a table by a hostess and served by a waiter. What a revelation. The dinner area is actually in a different room and you can avoid the really cute market.  The Getting There  Mr. Hyde Says - The parking, or rather lack there of, is a huge negative. There is minimal parking on premises, minimal parking across the street, with most of the neighboring businesses posting signs, threatening to tow you.   Dr. Jekyll Says - Let's call this place what it is - a nice neighborhood restaurant that can prove "convenient" if you live nearby and can walk, avoiding the hassle and frustration that awaits you when you have to drive there.   Summary In the end, it's really four stars for the pizza, two for the breakfast foods, but they get dinged an extra star for the headache that is parking.   Many Phoenicians love this place. I (we) think you can do better elsewhere.   Author's Note: My girlfriend has now moved from this neighborhood, so any argument in her favor for a visit based on proximity is now moot. Mr. Hyde has cracked a menacing smile.

I've bought tires from Discount Tire for years at different locations and have had a good experience, but this location was different. I went in to get some new tires with my fianc√©. John the sales guy pushed a certain brand, specifically because they were running a rebate special. Tires are tires, especially on a Prius, so we went with them.   Later that day, when filling out the rebate form online, I noticed that the model number that we purchased was not listed on the valid model numbers for the promotion. I called back to Discount Tire, told them the dilemma, who then stated the model number was irrelevant and the rebate would go through.   I'll give you 1 second to contemplate where I'm heading with this. A couple weeks later we got an email saying our entry was denied due to non-valid model number. We called back to Discount Tire, where John denied any knowledge, spoke to the manager, who told me it was his last day and his hands were tied. I then called the regional office, left a message and NEVER got a call back.   Next time I need tires, I'm going to C&R or Big O, or any other of the countless places on every street corner that sells them. Just not a way to run a business.

For me, there are two types of sushi restaurants in cities outside of New York and LA, where Japanese restaurants are abundant and go beyond traditional sushi fare.  Type 1 - "All About The Decor" - These sushi restaurants are more concerned with the overall aesthetic, where the budget and level of importance is clearly put toward fancy tables, expensive light fixtures, majestic waterfalls, flaming centerpieces, state-of-the-art sound systems and a wait staff waiting to be discovered. Let's not be confused here - the food is really an afterthought.   Type 2 - "All About The Food" - These type of sushi restaurants exist off the main drags, resting subtly in dimly lit corners of strip malls next to dollar stores, or in the case of Kampai, a bowling alley. They are typically "mom and pop" family run organizations, poorly decorated, and have a singular focus - really fresh and really good food.   Kampai is your classic Type 2 joint. I've been many times now, only getting around to writing this review after another visit. It's simple, straight forward sushi. Always fresh, with the standard menu expected by those who want straight forward sushi in a no frills environment.   There's no music blaring and no crazy list of rolls with ridiculously named concoctions with so many ingredients, you really can't identify any flavors once it hits your tongue.   Don't get me wrong, there's always a time and place for Type 1 sushi places - parties, happy hours, etc. But if you want good food, fresh fish, a straight forward selection and all of it prepared by actual sushi chefs speaking Japanese, look not further.        Author's Note: If you watch shows like No Reservations, you'll know that Anthony Bourdain always speaks highly of places like Kampai and would never find himself in Type 1 restaurants.

Been here twice now. The first experience was blah. The second the same and for that you get a friendly two stars.   Forget why this place has a Hawaiian Island theme when the menu really just serves rice bowls and burgers. So let's talk about the rice bowls, of which I had on both occasions.   After waiting entirely too long for my food, it came out luke warm both times and having ordered the chicken with a different flavor option, the chicken is really nothing more than pre-cooked cubes which you are invited to drown in a store-bought sauce. I wouldn't have minded waiting longer if I was convinced that any part of my meal was prepared fresh and not so blatantly pre-made.   I've had worse, but not necessarily rushing back.

I've been to Fresh Mint several times over the past years and always have a great meal. Having changed jobs, I find myself in that part of town less, but revisited last week with a vegetarian friend and a girlfriend who dabbles. I, on the other hand, enjoy being an omnivore, but regardless of culinary position, this place is just plain great. I'm amazed at how flavorful the sauces are and the menu is fairly diverse with great choices. It's run by a husband/wife team who do the serving and cooking, so you're basically eating their home-cooked meals. I've heard it is also a Kosher certified restaurant, so you know you're getting quality food.

I've driven by this place a ton and finally decided to give it a try on a Saturday morning. It was a lot smaller than I expected, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I still was able to get seated right away, with my girlfriend and I getting the last table.   In all, the food was quite good and the service is attentive - how can they not be with this place being so "intimate."   I'm looking forward to going back, especially for lunch to check out their sandwich selection.

I've been to this place twice now, and it does not disappoint. Everything I've had (mostly the lamb dishes) has been incredibly tasty and tender.   The staff at Al Hamra are very nice and attentive. They make good recommendations and don't hover over you as you eat. The decor is nice. Fairly standard, but not down-market by any means, after all, it is in a decent area surrounded by high-income rooftops.   The only problem I have is I wish more people would go. I've only been on weeknights so I can't speak to the (hopefully busy) weekend crowd, but this place could use a couple more people discovering it and becoming loyal customers. It is pricey, which may be a result of the location, but it's better than most other Indian places I've been.   Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed.

My girlfriend and I stumbled on this place while doing some early morning errands and we were both pleasantly surprised. It's nice, clean, well lighted and locally owned, which is a big plus for us considering the amount of chains in my area.   We ordered french toast and their Pumpkin pancake special. They both were really great, to the point of being stuffed -  we skipped lunch altogether.   She ordered a cappuccino, which she wasn't too thrilled with, and that was the only knock. My standard cup o' coffee was just fine.  The service was attentive and all of the staff was incredibly friendly.   We will definitely be going back.

For anyone with movie-envy from friends living in LA, SF or NYC who talk about going to cool art house theaters, this is the answer for Phoenix. Unlike Camelview, which is more of a traditional theater, FilmBar is really more of a cool bar that also happens to show movies. You can simply go to grab a drink, but doing so before/during/after one of their flicks is what this place is all about. Forget about some of the big-budget movies that you'll likely regret seeing and check out FilmBar for a unique movie going experience.

I've been sayiing for a long time Phoenix needs a broader diversity of ethnic restaurants beyond the standards. Enter Sekong By Night. This quaint little place tucked on the north side of Indian School is well worth the visit, despite the difficulty you will likely have in finding it.   While culinarily similar to the likes of Thai and Vietnamese food, it is different enough to stand on its own. There are standard spring rolls, but then you can get into the meat dishes and this pancake/crepe thing that is my new favorite. I'm excited for it to cool down just a bit here so I can justify eating more of their soups, of which they have many.   It's run by this young guy who is incredibly nice and is more than willing to give my girlfriend and I some advice on our hopeful and potential travels to the region. I think his mom is the chef, which makes this a great "mom and pop" (mom and son, really) place worth the trek from any point in the valley.

Regardless of how long I waited to get my car windows tinted (too long), I found the perfect place to have it done. I'm not sure what I was expecting, a garage type place maybe, but my first impression with Apex Tint is that it's clean and welcoming. Jody walked me through my options and I found the prices quite reasonable and the install was quicker than I thought. They told me it would be a couple days before the tinting cured, but frankly, it looked good right out of the shop. Check these guys out. It's definitely worth it.

My fianc√© and I found this place thanks to a Groupon, otherwise we would have never known about it. I'm not a vegetarian, but the reviews on Yelp were good so I was looking forward to it. To cut to the chase, we both really liked what we had, which was quite a lot of dishes considering we had to order enough to meet our dollar value.   I really like Indian food, but always order dishes with different meats, etc. This style, I believe is more in line with Southern India cuisine, and was quite different than what I've had before, but doesn't mean it wasn't as tasty.   What really set the experience apart was the wait staff. We were helped out by two different waiters, each tag-teaming different tables. I really like when waiters offer their opinions on dishes instead of saying "everything's good." We asked what they recommended, they gave us some options, then we asked what they eat and they gave us different choices, which we selected.   And another good marker, we were one of a small handful of non-Indians there, which is always a good sign for a place like this.   While I would have loved to have these dishes with little bits of tasty lamb, I still think it was very good and recommend this place highly. We'll be going back.

Quick 3 word review: Food Truck Fiasco  Longer review: This could have been good. There were many food trucks and tons of eager people wanting to taste their offerings. Only problem is the lines were so long, after waiting two hours in one line, yes, one line and I admit that sounds excessive. And it was. So bitter after getting our food and wasting the day, we left. I've been to other culinary festivals where you wait in line for a couple minutes, but this was ridiculous and all lines were the same. In the end, too many people made lines unbearable and the festival a failure.

My girlfriend heard about this place and the both of us are always looking for some good beers on tap, so we decided to stop in one day after work and before a flight to California.   It's nicely located in Old Town, not too far off Scottsdale Rd, situated in a mix of different bars and restaurants. I found the decor inviting, with deep woods and a nice open atmosphere.   Firstly, the beer list did not disappoint. This was the main reason we went and while it had some of the classics we really like, the bartender was very helpful in recommending some additional items that he felt we'd enjoy. The beers we sampled were really great and we were grateful for the time he spent in speaking with us.   As for the food, we just got some apps as it was too early for dinner, but what we had was quite good. We ordered the Pig Ear dish, which was strands of pig's ears, fried and tossed in buffalo hot sauce. May not be for everyone, but the taste was quite good. It was a cross between a really chewy piece of calamari and the flavor of a wing. We also ordered the buratto, which was a nice compliment to the other dish.   I'm looking forward to going back, exploring some other hard to find beers and dive deeper into the menu.

Went here the day after they opened. It looked great and the food was on par with the other location I'd been to before, so no early stage growing pains on that front.   The pizzas are pretty good, if not slightly over priced, but you're paying a bit for the atmosphere instead of a hole in the wall type joint.   The staff was attentive, maybe too much so since they just opened, but that can't be a ding against them. I'd rather have too much instead of too little.   Love there beer selection and the rotating tap is a great reason to go back often.   I'm glad to see a business give City North a go. I live nearby and hope this place is a catalyst for other businesses to come in and get the place off the ground.

Go now! This 5 star review is equally deserving on two fronts: 1) The Restaurant; and 2) The Management. The place is great, but read on to The Management piece as to why the guys running this place are out and out champs.   The Restaurant My wife has been trying to get me here for a couple of weeks now and we finally headed there Friday after work. First impression was the place is really well appointed, but not trying too hard - inviting, hip, but not pretentious. The cocktail menu was a nice surprise. Good wines, beers and sake, but the surprise was the really interesting cocktails. I ordered a bourbon drink with thai chili infused honey. Distinctively bourbon on the front, slight heat on back. Really darn good.   The food, though, was clearly the best part. My wife and I shared several dishes, with the clear winner the pork dumplings on a bed of spicy kimchi and peppers. This thing was probably the best dumpling/pot sticker I ever had. The dumpling was soft with crispy edges and the meat was tender and not too greasy. My wife couldn't stop raving about the great texture. We got an octopus soup and ramen, both outstanding. Lastly, we ordered a duck bun dish, which I've had similar types at other places and all were way too greasy, but this was not at all, just great.   The Management The owners really care about their customers and are doing whatever they can to make the dining experience the best possible. They have the unfortunate circumstance to be located next to the George and Dragon, a Phoenix staple and outright dump, but the problem here is that the management of the pub is so perturbed that another place opened near them, they have taken on the hobby of watching people park in their nearly invisibly posted parking spots (dirt covered paint on pavement) and calling a tow truck, purely out of spite. Little does the G&D management know that being a jerk to The Clever Koi impacts their customers also. Case in point, I parked in what turned out to be one of the pub's spots. Instead of them telling me to simply move my car, they called a tow truck. As my car was being mounted, unbeknownst to me, the owners of The Clever Koi paid off the tow truck driver to protect their customer, in this case, me. Apparently, this happens nearly all the time, with the pub owners having cars towed, purely to be jerks. Little do these guys know that my wife and I were talking about going to have a beer there after dinner. I will NEVER go this this pub again.   I went and talked with the manager of the G&D and told him how childish and stupid his tactics were. He thinks he's hurting his restaurant neighbors, but being a jerk to the customers also hurts them.   You can read my well-deserving 0 star review of them, but the point here is that The Clever Koi is a great place. It's well appointed, not pretentious and the food is interesting and delicious. This place is solid. Go now - just make sure you take advantage of the complimentary valet.
