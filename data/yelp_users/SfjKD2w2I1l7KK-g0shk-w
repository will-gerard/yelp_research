Very friendly staff. The food is your standard, run of the mill Americanized Chinese fare. Nothing incredibly special here. They serve decent portions for a great price (see the lunch specials). They even deliver! A really solid choice when you're feeling Chinese takeout.   Note: Wong's Chicken is equivalent to General Tso's Chicken. I found this place because I wanted to find some really awesome General Tso's Chicken after watching the "Search for General Tso" documentary on Netflix. Highly recommended for anyone interested in food history.

I hate beating down on large franchised establishment because I'm sure it's a struggle to run one and deal with the large volume of customers on the daily. However, they usually seem to do OK and do damn well at serving their purpose -- you want something a step up from McDonalds, yet not have to dress up and go sit down somewhere with waiter service.   Cafe Rio is particularly bad. Their food service station is an absolute mess. They somehow still messed up our order after being corrected twice, probably something to do with their bizarre and disorganized grill situation. None of the veggies looked appetizing. Most disappointing of all, you can't even say you're getting a decent taco because the whole thing is soaked in red, translucent grease and you can't really taste much else.  Look elsewhere for a decent meal.

Words can't describe how much I love this place. All the flavors are amazing. My personal favorite is the stracciatella. You're welcome. It's clear that the gelato chef takes great care in not only the taste and creamy consistency of each flavor, but also in the presentation. This is some of the best I've ever had, and I've lived in cities with amazing ice cream (Bi-rite, Jeni's, Molly Moon's, Pappalecco, etc.).   However, my go-to order is always the the sorbetini. They blend up to 3 (4 for the large) flavors of sorbet with sparkling water. It is incredibly refreshing and tasty, especially on a warm Phoenix night. Some flavor combinations: Pineapple, blackberry, limoncello (Thanks Amanda for this rec) and strawberry, peach, lemon.

Stopped by while biking home. I have been anticipating their opening since I first saw a feature  in the Phoenix New Times. The moment I walked in, I knew I'd love it. They have an extensive selection of craft brews, an exceptionally friendly staff who clearly loves their beer, cool DIY-style decor, and a good lineup of taps. Pricing may be a bit higher than your local supermarket or Total Wine, but it is absolutely worth supporting your local downtown business. Downtown Phoenix is booming and this store is a very welcome addition to our growing city.   I will be going back and filling my growler with some Bell's Two-Hearted.

The chilaquiles were a slam dunk. Light, crisp chips with a generous spread of spicy green chile, cotija cheese, and crema, and two over-easy eggs with runny yolk. They made for an incredible breakfast with a nice, hot cup of black coffee. The GF had the quesadilla which had an interesting red-chile tortilla. It felt more like a large taco than a quesadilla, so don't be disappointed if you're expecting a gooey, cheesy mess. The quesadilla was delicious, but there was too little pork (which is a shame, because it was tasty!).   Love the family feel to the establishment and service was on point. Welcome to the neighborhood, Presidio!
