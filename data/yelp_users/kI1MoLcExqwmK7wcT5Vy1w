I crave Zoe's when I'm in the mood for something light and fairly healthy. I love their chicken salad and tuna salad. Both are pretty much just meat, mayo, and salt/pepper/spices, I think. No onions and no mustard make me a happy chicken/tuna salad eater! I also love their pimento cheese, feta slaw, and potato salad. The chocolate cake, though, is what hooked me onto Zoe's in the first place. It is basically a Texas sheet cake - moist, not too overpoweringly chocolatey, with that boiled fudge frosting that soaks in and seals in the goodness of the cake. {Droooool}

Food is excellent, service is good, and the prices can't be beat. I had a Vegas roll, and the tempura-fried batter was perfectly light and crispy. The Jap-Chae appetizer (thinly sliced beef with carrots, mushrooms, and spinach over potato noodles in a sweet and savory sauce) was delicious and an amazing deal. Yakisoba with seafood - portion was huge, seafood was perfectly cooked, and the dish was tastefully seasoned. These 3 dishes and 2 alcoholic beverages only set us back $40 (plus tip - which was well-deserved). We will definitely be returning!

My first experience with Crazy Jim's was when my boss ordered it in for the whole office. It seemed like I had barely given our secretary the order when {poof!}, the food appeared! First impression: Crazy Jim's has Crazy Fast delivery!   Then, I bit into the warm, doughy pita bread. Brushed with a bit of oil before grilling, it seems to be homemade, and was absolutely delicious! Second impression: Crazy Jim's has the best pita I've ever tasted...  I moved onto to my chicken feta salad with creamy greek dressing. Chicken = slightly charred, but not too dry, and totally delicious. Feta = abundant and high quality. And then, there's the creamy greek dressing... oh my zeus, it is amazing! Creamy and garlicky and completely drool-worthy. I now crave it frequently! Overall impression: This. Place. Rocks.  We still order in to for the office every once in awhile, but I also frequent the restaurant on my own. I've dined in and ordered takeout, and every time, the food is more than satisfactory. I must admit that I'm hooked on the chicken feta salad, and I have only slightly branched out from there (the goat cheese salad, which was good, but not as good as the chicken salad!), but my other half has eaten their calzones and other items and has always been pleased as well.   We just moved less than half a mile away, so I can see a lot more Crazy Jim's in our future!

We went to Compass for my birthday dinner last night and will not be returning again.  My fiance told me after our disappointing dinner that he had called earlier in the day to confirm our reservation and notified them that it was my birthday.  He was told that they would greet me with a "Happy Birthday" at the door and then they would bring out a banner and candles with dessert. He told them that would be great because he knows I love surprises...  We showed up and gave the hostess the name on the reservation, but there was no birthday greeting.  That was fine with me because I wasn't expecting it.  Then, when we got to the table the hostess asked if we were celebrating anything, and we told her it was my birthday.  The waiter came by a moment later and also asked if we were celebrating anything, and once again we told him it was my birthday. Despite having asked about it, neither really acknowledged it.  It was like they were just reading from their script, but not listening to the answers.   The service was awkward from the very beginning - the waiter stood there waiting for our drink orders while we clearly were not ready (we were both trying to look at one wine list and passing it back and forth across the table), and then finally asked if we needed another moment.  We ended up ordering cocktails, and my pomegranate margarita was not good - it tasted heavily of sour mix.  I drank less than a third of it and decided it wasn't worth the calories.   I ordered the scallops for dinner and my fiance ordered the salmon.  Both were decent but unremarkable. The service remained awkward throughout dinner.  We were pretty full when it came time for dessert, so we decided to split the goat cheese cheesecake.  Once again, decent but unremarkable.  The disappointing part was that they didn't even put a candle in the dessert or decorate the plate or anything - so much for birthday pictures. And I didn't know to expect the banner, but my fiance was disappointed that they had told him about it but didn't follow through - he was really looking forward to surprising me.   This brings me to the worst part.  We spent over $100 on dinner - we had ordered salads, entrees, dessert, and drinks - and not only did they not really acknowledge that we were celebrating my birthday, they didn't even comp my dessert! This is the first restaurant I've ever been to that didn't do SOMETHING to acknowledge a birthday - whether it be a candle, special plate decoration, or at least free dessert.     Bottom line - the view was pretty, the food was mediocre, and the service was terrible.  So disappointing!

When I moved to Phoenix a year and a half ago, I did a Google search for the best cupcake in Phoenix. I found an article about the cupcakes at Urban Cookies being delicious (even though it was pre-Cupcake Wars, and they were better known for their cookies back then), and since it wasn't too far from my work, I decided to stop in and try one. I've been obsessed ever since. I love the all-natural ingredients. And I especially love that I can taste the high-quality butter in the buttercream (and even though it's not a meringue buttercream, which is my favorite kind, it's still not too sweet). I usually stick to the non-chocolate flavors, as I'm not the biggest chocolate fan, and their chocolate stuff is really rich (if you're a chocolate fiend, you're in luck!). The vanilla, strawberry, and peanut butter are my favorites, but I also love some of the non-traditional and seasonal varieties. I'm a devoted UrbanCookies/OllieCake fan for life!

The drinks were great, the food was palatable, but the service was absolutely terrible, and I have never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant in my life.   I took 7 ladies here for my bachelorette party dinner (we wanted a low-key affair with good food and good drinks, and since I was going to Jamaica for my honeymoon, we figured this was the perfect place). We are all working professional women who are accustomed to fine dining and good service, but unfortunately, we got none of that at The Breadfruit.   Our waitress tried to push the most expensive thing on the menu multiple times, despite my friends saying they don't like seafood. She then tried to push everyone to order sides of rice and peas (I really wonder if they make a commission from selling rice and peas), and also suggested that my friend order some for her 1-year-old son. My friend went ahead and ordered it because she figured he could nibble on it if he wanted, and it wouldn't be a big waste of money if he didn't like it or wasn't hungry. More on this later...  Another friend asked the waitress if she could get her meal without anything banana-related on the plate, because she has a banana aversion. The waitress extremely rudely replied "The menu SAYS right THERE that no substitutions are allowed. And they AREN'T bananas - they're plantains." My friend stated that she couldn't eat either bananas or plantains, and that she wasn't asking for a substitution, but rather the omission of the plantains from the plate. The waitress stated that it could not be done, because it would ruin the presentation of the dish, so I just piped up and told my friend I would take her plantains off the plate.   Now back to the rice and peas. When the 1-year-old started eating it, he spilled some of it onto the table, and then wiped what he had spilled from the table onto the floor (he's a 1-year-old, after all! He hadn't made a peep the entire time we were there, nor did he ever try to get down from his adult-sized chair, so pushing some rice onto the floor was not a huge transgression). The waitress immediately came over and said, in the rudest voice ever, "Oh that's just GREAT. Can you just NOT let him do that???" to which my friend replied, "Don't you have a broom? I will clean it up." The waitress just rolled her eyes and disappeared (but never did bring a broom). My friends and I are generous tippers, and would have rewarded the waitress greatly for dealing with the aftermath of a toddler's dinner. However, after the rudeness we had experienced up to this point, we couldn't take it any longer. We asked the other waiter to speak to a manager, and after about 5 minutes (during which time our waitress never did reappear), the manager finally came over and spoke to us. He told us that the waiter would be serving us for the rest of our dinner, instead of the waitress, but he never did apologize for his employee's rude behavior.   I see from other Yelp reviews that others have had similar experiences with that waitress, and I question if she is still employed solely based on her scallop- and rice-and-pea- upselling abilities. It was clear she wanted to do as little work as possible and clear our table as quickly as possible.   If I had only gone for drinks, I would definitely go back again, but I don't think the food is good enough for me to want to tolerate the utterly crappy service, and I know can get good drinks so many other places. Sorry Breadfruit, but I will be getting my Jamaican-food fix elsewhere from now on!

Absolutely love the tacos al pastor! The refried beans are pretty good, too. Fiance loves their carne asada, and I think it's pretty good, too, but I just can't shake the pastor addiction! Oh, and I love America's corn - covered in mayo, cotija cheese, and served with lime!

Love the shredded beef, the whole wheat tortillas, and the stevia-sweetened homemade lemonade. One of my favorite places for a quick meal!

This is one of my favorite go-to places in Phoenix, and I feel fortunate to live just a mile away.   The atmosphere is excellent - low-lighting, wooden floors, modern decor in a vintage-looking house-turned-restaurant.   The food is even better. I have never ordered anything I didn't love (with the exception of the cheesecake, which isn't made in-house - it was just okay). I crave their tuna salad on a regular basis - it's good both in the tuna salad salad and in the tuna salad sandwich.  The grilled cheese is the bomb, and so is the cashew butter banana sandwich. The mac and cheese is superb, as well. Seriously, everything rocks. I highly recommend ordering the mixed greens as your side if you get a sandwich - the dressing is light and citrusy and smacks of homemade excellence.   Oh, and it won't empty your wallet, either. The prices are excellent for the quality of food you get!

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!  This place is dirty, dingy, and extremely disorganized.    First of all, I tried calling this place from the moment it opened on a Sunday.  The line was busy for 2 hours, so we finally decided to get in the car and drive down there.  When I walked in, there was not a single customer in the store, and I didn't see the counter from the door (it's hidden to the right in the front of the store), and yet neither of the sales girls (who were just being lazy behind the counter) greeted me or let me know they were there.  I finally found them and gave them a list of 30 or 40 dresses I was interested in trying on.  They told me that the store was organized by size, not by designer or style, so I would have to walk up and down every aisle to find the dresses I wanted.  They had an outdated list of their stock, and weren't sure if they had most of the dresses I was looking for.  It took them an hour (no exaggeration) to let me know that they thought they MIGHT have three of the dresses I wanted to see (I had already found two of them on my own, and the third was nowhere to be found).   Meanwhile, I walked up and down the aisles looking for the dresses.  I found several to try on, and my friend ended up pulling them for me and taking them back to the fitting room.  The dresses were dirty and ripped. The lighting was poor, the industrial carpet in the store was gross, and the sales girls (Angel and Cherish, I believe?) just seemed to disappear and were not helpful at all. My friend helped me into and out of the dresses.  When one of the sales girls saw me in a dress that I had to hold up to keep on me (the zipper was totally broken), she acted shocked that the zipper was not functioning and almost insinuated that I had broken it (even though the dress was 2 sizes too big for me...).   The salespeople - if they can even be called that- are not friendly or personable, and the manager smells like she just licked an ashtray.  I cannot believe that certain higher-end designers (e.g. Maggie Sottero) actually allow them to carry their dresses.      Despite the negative things I've heard about David's Bridal, I think you'd be better off there.  At least DB is a national company with some sort of accountability. This place is just a nightmare and I can't imagine ever buying anything from them!

Blech. I wish I had that $3.83 back. I saw this place on Groupon yesterday, and the picture of the strawberry cupcake was so beautiful, I had to have one. I stopped by, and everything in the case looked pretty good. I settled on the strawberry, based on that Groupon picture, and its description - strawberry cake, filled with strawberry compote, and topped with strawberry buttercream. That description ending up being deceiving though. Everything tasted like fake strawberry, and the "compote" was that nasty gelatinous "strawberry filling" that comes in a tub. I'm not sure the "buttercream" had any butter in it at all, and if it did, it was overwhelmed by shortening. I ate a couple bites of the cupcake, then placed the rest of it back into the handy container to throw it away. It was just SO not worth the calories. And the price was outrageous for what are clearly low-quality ingredients (you'd be better off buying grocery store cupcakes). Maybe I just made a mistake by trying the strawberry. But I won't be going back to find out if any other flavors are better.   When I left this place, I drove straight to Urban Cookies to get my fix. For just $2.80 I had a replacement cupcake that was far superior in quality and taste.

My fiance and I went for dinner on a Friday night a few weeks ago. I was SO pissed off after the experience that I figured I'd wait awhile to write a review. I had a $25 restaurant.com gift certificate.  The terms on the certificate stated that you had to spend $35 minimum, alcohol not included, and that an 18% gratuity would be added to the pre-coupon total. Fine with me - I'm used to those terms on these types of certificates.   We were greeted by an older gentleman who was pretty friendly and joked with us about where we wanted to sit. We were then waited on by another guy (possibly an owner or manager? he was loud and somewhat obnoxious). He tried to get us to order wine, but I've been having headaches from wine recently, so we passed, even though he was pushy about it (which is weird - lots of people don't drink at all, for religious or health reasons, so I don't understand trying to force a customer to order alcohol).   We ordered a 2-cheese plate, and asked for the house-made mozzarella and the "dried cow's milk cheese." We were given the supposedly house-made mozzarella and the smoked mozzarella, which was disappointing because I don't like smoked cheeses at all.  I decided not to say anything because my fiance likes smoked cheese, so I figured he could enjoy it.  The "house-made mozzarella" was a misnomer - I have had better "fresh" mozzarella from the grocery store. The roasted veggies were pretty good.   Next, we ordered a Prosciutto Pizza and a mixed-greens salad. The salad was really good, the dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette and it was crisp and refreshing.  The pizza was good as well - full of flavor and piping hot.  The crust was a little soggy, but that doesn't bother me at all. We were full after the cheese and veggies and salad, so we asked to take half the pizza to go.   The waiter brought our bill, and we gave him our restaurant.com certificate.  He immediately, and very rudely, said that we couldn't use it, even though our pre-tax bill totalled more than $40, and the certificate said we had to order $35 worth of food. I told him that we had complied with the terms that were on the certificate. He said that to use the certificate we needed to order 2 entrees. I told him that the certificate didn't say that, and that it just said our bill needed to be more than $35, which it was.  He repeated that the "terms of the certificate" required us to order 2 entrees, and said the certificate is designed "so that people will order two entrees and wine and order more food." I pointed out the fact that the certificate specifically states that alcohol is excluded, and he still tried to fight me on it, but finally relented and said he would go ahead and do it "this time." (Of course, after his rudeness, I'm not sure why he expected there would be a next time). He took my certificate, calculated the final bill, and brought it back to us - you could tell he was totally pissed at us at this point. He then sent someone else out to pick up our payment and to box up my pizza. He added a 20% gratuity to the bill (which was totally fine - we knew we were getting a good deal by using the certificate). After we paid, we left and will never return. The pizza was decent enough, but wouldn't be worth paying full price, and I would never attempt to use a coupon there again, only to risk being treated rudely. If the restaurant doesn't want to honor those types of certificates, they shouldn't sign up for them. Or, alternatively, they should place more restrictions or additional terms on the deal, and stick to the terms printed on the deal. They could easily require a minimum of $50 to be spent (lots of other restaurant.com restaurants do).   Bottom line - we will never go back, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.  I awarded 2 stars simply because the food was decent.

I've been going to The Joint on Camelback since it opened several months ago. I have the $49 a month package, and go in once a week for a quick adjustment. Dr. Lees is very skilled and able to fix my often-out-of-place neck and back!

Love this place!   I had always wanted to try its predecessor restaurant, The Living Room (which I believe was owned by the same people), but I never got around to it.  Shortly after Humble Pie opened in its place, a Groupon came out, so it was perfect timing to try it.  We bought two Groupons, and I'm so glad we did.  The first time we went, we ordered the shrimp pizza and the mac and cheese, and split both. The food came SO fast after we ordered it, and the pizza was fresh out of the brick oven. The shrimp pizza was so tasty, and the mac and cheese was sinfully rich and good.   The second time, we went a bit lighter. The fiance ordered the chili (which is a holdover item from The Living Room menu - we had intended to try it before the Living Room closed) and a sandwich. I ordered a caprese appetizer. The chili was really good - I ended up eating half of it even though I thought I didn't want any. The caprese was soooo delicious. The mozzarella was super creamy and high quality, and the pesto was incredible. I would go back just for the caprese alone, but will certainly go back for the pizza, too.   The prices are good - not the cheapest around, but definitely high quality ingredients and preparation for the money.

So. Good. I'm still salivating!  We had: - praline bacon - room temperature but totally crispy to perfection - I WANT MORE!  - rose sherry macaron - really good, awesome flavor, perfect texture - caramel macaron - also really good, but wish I had eaten this one first, because I still had the taste of the rose sherry one in my mouth - eclair - the pastry cream was to die for - not too sweet, not too heavy - praline chocolate tart - amazing caramel sauce, delicious chocolate, perfect pastry - you can tell they make all ingredients from scratch and they are divine  We will be back! Next on our list to try - croissants, beignets, and genoise cake.

We've been back twice since our initial visit, and it's still good!   During the week, we had beignets (piping hot, good flavor, and definitely cooked in clean oil - always a plus!), a cinnamon roll (had a hint of nutmeg or something that I wasn't really a fan of), a quiche lorraine (so good! pastry was excellent), and a ham and cheese croissant (also very good).   Today (Saturday) we just HAD to get more of the praline bacon that we had last week... mmmmm, meat candy! We also got a duck sandwich on a batard roll (a bit pricey at $13.95, but excellent - heavy on the duck, with flavored goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and a port reduction), and a quiche lorraine and an almond croissant to save for tomorrow's breakfast, since they aren't open on Sundays.   We're about to move across the country, and I'm really sad to be leaving this awesome eatery behind!
