God these guys are so rude. It's like, it's not enough you're overpriced- but basic phone and customer service manners are non-existent.   Called them with a simple request after regretfully spending 1200 on a BBQ from these dbags and the hillbilly who answered the phone was next level rude- do yourself a favor, go somewhere else.

Really good sushi! I'm from San Fran, and usually skeptical about eating Sushi in AZ, but this place is the exception. My dad dragged me in and i ended up really enjoying myself. Great service and phenomenal tempura, deff get an order of that with your sushi (same with tempura rolls). Toro rolls and shrimp were both really tasty.Also it looks like they keep the place really clean which is comforting. Definitely will be my sushi spot from now on living in Scottsdale.

So happy I found this place!   So I have been looking for a good dry cleaner for a while here after finally having ENOUGH with prestige cleaners and their overpriced, under-served customers.  Clearly this place has a few locations, and isn't a mom and pop shop, but here are the facts: -Open Sundays (huge!!!) -Open 7am-8pm weekdays (also huge!) -Same day turnaround -Reasonably Priced  My new thing is taking my dress shirts here right before I travel and ask them to fold (instead of hang)... This way I get all my dress shirts army style folded, wrapped in plastic, packed into a nice box and ready to be packed... Makes packing SO MUCH EASIER.... If you travel alot, I suggest this, it's always important to look fresh ;) !

Red Robin is what it is, so I'm basing this review against like kind restaurants (chili's, olive garden, etc...) Had a great meal, cheap cold beer, and a good experience. Food came out very quickly, bartender was a really nice guy. Also looked clean and well managed.

Surprised to see such bad reviews here, so I am going to overcompensate with a 5-star so they can work to even this deal out...  It is not a 5-star place, no doubt, but for where it is, what it is, and the price it is, damn good deal and a nice track...  It's harder than one would think to play golf in Scottsdale if you are a reasonably good golfer and want a good course, but can't afford a $200 dollar round. I don't like the super cheap courses because its more pain than it is pleasure.  Starfire offers that middle ground for me, a mid-range golf course, that by no means is it BEAUTIFUL or BREATHTAKING, but what it is, a good track for a good price... There are a couple of really great holes too...  You'll find me out here at least 1x a month

Ruined several of my shirts, extremely overpriced, unhelpful employees... This place is on my black-list...  If you are going to use them DO NOT, i repeat, DO NOT do what they call 'fluff and fold', it's what they told me was the same as Wash/Fold laundry at other places....What it turned out to be was wash, with no fold... the folding was amateur, and that means a lot coming from someone who pays to get things folded for him haha! Plus it was expensive as shit! One of the things I miss most about SF is chinese wash/fold, it is amazing there...

Desperation Car wash, mayyybeee....   Why they don't have a Danny's in Old Town I do not understand....  I have been here several times and it's just part of the "fool me once..." type deal...   Everytime= shitty experience. They push wayyy to hard on the upsell, to the point where you feel uncomfortable (TBH i actually did it once, just because I felt so uncomfortable, not because I wanted my cracked glass repaired...)  The wash usually sucks, you should have no need to go here unless your just worried about getting the outside dusted off, like post-monsoon, quick wash over....  DO NOT get detailing... I speak from experience, waste of money. Also, the lounge is a dump...

I have created the ULTIMATE pizza at this place and I am feeling generous enough to share my glorious toppings combination under one condition: you must refer to it as the 'King Sam' pizza....  Don't believe it's that good? Your crazy, try it and then thank me later...  The KING SAM: Any Pizza with these Toppings: -Pesto -Chicken -Garlic -Onion -Jalepeno  ** if you like hot pizza, put a dash of Tabasco on it for the final touch... wow.   You are welcome...  And Grimaldi's -- Keep up the good work, our company Sitevoice across Market Street are all big fans of the good food you produce time and time again.

Wish I would have known about this place 8 months ago... What a great little spot.   Unfortunately, in sort of a dumpy mini-mall is hidden this little gem, great food, great service and very affordable.   I had the Falafel Pita and also tried some of my friends Philly Cheese Steak Pita, both were two thumbs up! Healthy, clean kept and a great atmosphere inside the restaurant... I will definitely be heading back here.

Alright, so I am somewhat conflicted writing this review and giving it only two stars, here's why:   I am from the Bay Area, Cali and just moved down here. In SF and Emeryville Trader Vic's is known for being a classy cool spot to go get good food and even better drinks in a funky environment. I have always loved Trader Vics and it has been one of my fav spots in the Bay for a while. Which leads me to the Scottsdale Trader Vic's which is basically at the Valley-Ho. Having just moved to Scottsdale I thought this would be a fun place to take a date, now wishing I would have chosen somewhere else.   This is a nontraditional Trader Vic's, typically known for their dark lighting and borderline tacky decor, this Trader Vic's looks like it belongs in a shopping mall. Really open and not very much decoration and on a Saturday night you could shot a cannon through the place. I ordered their famous Mai Tai which is usually awesome, but sucked, hardly any booze, wayyy too heavy on the lime. OK scratch the fun drinks, I get a bottle of wine with some disappointment as my dates drink also sucked.   Service was OK, not great... couple slip ups here and there, like pouring regular tap water into my glass of 1/2 full of bubbly water that was 8 bucks, then pouring me another one and trying to sneak a 2nd bottle onto my tab, busted. They redeemed themselves quite a bit by taking off one of our entrees (the duck, which was disgusting, dry, and tasteless) from the tab after she had said it was terrible.   The food in general was disappointing. In SF, Trader Vics has a poignant menu and a variety of different types of beef/seafood/chicken/wok. Not really the case at this one. I don't eat seafood so I was expecting to see my favorite Peppercorn NY Strip on the menu, not there. Basically if you don't eat seafood you have to pick from the duck (which was terrible), the beef tenderloin (what I ordered, was reasonable but wickedly overpriced at like $34) or another grilled chicken dish. The mashed potatoes were cold, the spare rib appetizer looked like it could have been served at Chili's (not a compliment) and in general the whole culinary experience was a disaster... as if that weren't enough then I got my tab... holy shit, i thought cost of living was cheaper down here, guess not at Trader Vics....   In general 2 thumbs down for SCOTTSDALE Trader Vic's, although I will maintain patronage to the SF ones as long as they don't head down this path....

The Vig is a happening place it seems... The outdoor back patio ROCKS, I mean it almost makes me regret quitting smoking because that place is a dream for a smoker lol...  Good drinks... Here's how I know this, I order a Greyhound (best drink ever imo) and the dude busts out freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, that makes such a difference, and it did not go unnoticed...   What I think, is that the Vig owners need to open up a new North Scottsdale location, bet you it would go over well up here and the nightlife is dwindling... Plus that side of Arcadia is a trek, even from old town scene...   Also, what is this I hear about the Vig bus? Apparently you can call and they will come and pick you up/drop you off (within reason)? That's pretty f-ing cool if you ask me...

So happy I found this place... Didn't realize what  a dump LA fitness was until I went in and checked this place out.  and extra $100 bucks a month is worth being able to use an obsessively clean locker room/sauna/steam, have a locker, have room to work out...  I have found I spend 3x as much time at the gym being at Village vs what I spent at LAFitness... it makes working out go from being a chore, to being something desirable... atleast for me.  The ONLY thing I can complain about is the price, and it's hard to complain about it because I like the place so much...

Awesome lunch spot! Every time I go here I leave satisfied... I used to go here all the time when I worked at Skysong but now have moved up to DC Ranch area.   Not going to lie, I have driven all the way down to Old Town on several occasions just to get lunch here... Granted I am obsessive and like the place alot, but either way, great little spot that you might miss driving by it!  Here are why I don't give it 5-stars: --They need more hours, open later... I mean their location is out of the Old Town foot traffic, I get it, but still! --Need to get the Drive Through situation worked out a little better...

Just moved down here to Scottsdale and I love finding places like this! Food was really good, I had a wild boar burger with coconut curry sauce and carmelized onions along with the standard beef/bacon/cheese burger. Both were delicious and their tator tots are AMAZING, brought me back to being a kid and eating tots, yet still were prepared and served in a classy way, nothing like well done spuds!  Service was really good also. The bartender spent quite a bit of time talking to me about local beers they have, their menu, where they get their meats and then suggested that I get the wild boar burger.  He was right on, friendly and helpful.  Two thumbs up for good service, good food, good location, cleanliness, and an all around good experience. Only downside is that it is a bit pricey...

I am the type of person that almost always orders 1 thing from each place I eat lunch, allowing me to mix up the location.  I say this because the 'Cosa Nostra' sandwich is why I come here. I don't need to try anything else because I enjoy it that much, every time.   It's also got a lot of cool unique Italian fares for take home, and the employees seem really nice...

Ordered a pizza from here the other night, seems like I have found a good place to compete against Grimaldi's...  Pizza came quickly and was delicious... A little on the expensive side... The thing I like about it is that it seems very home-made and not part  of a repeatable equation like Grimaldi's...   I will be ordering here again, no doubt about it.

This place is great! I work up the street and it's a nice place to come sit after work... I usually get the Steak Salad, it's a perfect size and delicious. Also get the falafel appetizer it's excellent, very filling tho... The place is a bit pricy, but its DC Ranch so i cant blame them. One of their secret things are the Sweet Potato chips, warning: they are addictive, can never eat less than a bag. There's two others that I know of, seems like they got a good little system going on, the one in Old Town is also very nice. Enjoy!

Wow, now you guys rename a new page The W Scottsdale and call this one something different to hide your bad ratings... SHADY...  My OG review was for the Scottsdale W and now it is for "The Living Room" and I see a Scottsdale W related ? hmm weird...  Shady, Shady, Shady....  And guess what, THIS W (not all) still sucks major donkey balls... I am also going to repost this review on both pages as it is for the HOTEL itself  (and yes i have stayed there)  Original Review: "this W sucks... So smug and unpleasant, whether its the annoying people, the overpriced everything, or the horrible staff, this place blows hard. I have been to W's in SF/Hollywood/NY and they all actually are pretty cool and I have enjoyed them.  You can totally tell that Persians run this joint, don't get me wrong, I love Persian people, but there is that certain breed of them that wear douchey designer glasses and are obsessed with shiny jewlery and their 3-series and treat people like shit. That is the vibe this place puts off, like a sleezy wanna be vegas spot that is so far from cool that it is laughable. Don't even waste your time, but if you do make sure to pre-game because that shit is expensive!"

Great find! Don't let the mini-mall outward appearence deter you!   Went here for lunch with our employees, almost decided not to because from the outward appearence it doesn't look special.  Its VERY authentic food, which is big for me because there are a ton of super-americanized mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. This is the real deal...  I got the Carne Asada Burrito and it was excellent. Then after finishing , the waitress was so kind and brought out some free blackened chicken tacos and they were also spectacular she mentioned that was their specialty.  Great service, great food, great prices... Secretive and decieving location...  Try it out you wont be disappointed!!

Great local bar with nice people and excellent service. I like to go there for Monday Night Football because they put it up on a HD projector screen against a huge white wall outside, it looks great. Bartenders are nice and quick to serve. It's a breath of fresh air from alot of the craziness that is Old Town Scottsdale.

One place in Old Town that I never get sick of due to their phenomenal service. Every bartender/barback/security employee there are top notch, friendly, generous, and in control.   I used to live in old town and frequent many places, I now live in North Scottsdale and frequent only one: the OTT. It lacks the strong scent of douchebaggery that plagues old town so severly.   Even the dbags that come here (believe me you, they do) seem to take it down a notch due to the friendly, comfortable, and welcoming atmosphere this place radiates...   Also, I love how the place is laid out, you're always a few steps away from being inside or outside or upstairs at the mini-patio thing.

Favorite little restaurant in Scottsdale ;) Delicious French cuisine, very cool decor and environment and reasonably priced for the quality of food. Been there many times and will continue to go whenever I'm trying to impress an out of towner... the only bad experience I had was when one of the hostesses said she couldn't seat me and my date w/o a reservation for an hour at like 6pm on a weeknight when the place was basically empty... After badgering her a little she accommodated, but made me feel like I was in Curb Your Enthusiasm or something.  I suggest the Escargot and the Steak Frites, c'est fantastique!  Cheers!

Initially I was satisfied with the job GoTronics did to repair my cracked iPhone 4 screen. It cost a 160 bucks and was done quickly (1hr) on pretty short notice. However, less than a week after the repair my iPhone screen cracked again in my pocket.    I have had ALOT of iPhones and broken many of them, this was not a typical break and I know there was some wierd faulty glass or something because it would not break like that ever. It was in my pocket with the case on and got pressed against my keys when I sat down and now I am back to step 1 (minus $160).  I went back to GoTronics and asked them if they could replace it considering it was less than a week ago and clearly something was not right with the initial repair. It's located in this wierd office that is a totally seperate business and they wouldn't let me go back to speak with the woman in their office they made me sit in the lobby, and then they wouldn't let me talk to the manager because he was on a "conference call".  Like any other poor business who does not care about retaining customers, the woman was not helpful and almost accusitory with her disbelief of my story and said that there was nothing she could do but give me a $10 discount on the next repair, ridiculous. F-that, stay away from this place, not worth your money, get one of those guys who comes to your house and fixes it.

Ok, now I was reasonably satisfied being a customer at LA fitness the past 6 months and am grateful I motivated myself to get off my ass and get in shape... I used all the equipment with the exception of a few things:  1. I didn't use the locker room not clean enough for me... 2. Didn't use the pool...  3. Didn't do any of the classes (did PT for a minute but too expensive)  A few weeks ago I signed up for a Trial Membership at The Village... Wow, I had NO IDEA what I was missing by being an LA Fitness Member... So adios LA... hello nice ass club with everything I wanted and then some...  Here is where my review gets bad on LA:   Cancelling this membership is a nightmare.  a)You want me to fill out a piece of paperwork and snail mail it to Irvine before you cancel my membership, ARE YOU FOR REAL?  b) The "Customer Service" number for my area was about as useful as banging my head in a wall... The woman who was trying to help me told  me and i quote she "...had never used the website and was unfamiliar with it...", FOR REAL?   c) The website is all bugged out and glitchy, they make it intentionally hard for you to discontinue your membership without going in and being badgered by one of the sales guys....  Good riddance!

Great spot, but it get's wayyyy too packed! Sort of a double edged sword, if it weren't always so packed it probably wouldn't be such a hotspot, but being so packed makes me decide to not go there about 60% of the time it crosses my mind.  My advice, if you are gonna go, go early and lock down a good location...

oh hello trouble!  What's the first sign you know you have a gambling problem? well maybe when you find yourself at an Indian Casino 3 Friday nights in a row until 4 in the morning... Guess I am just a degenerate...  So yah, now im broke... hahah just kidding... but in all seriousness, dent on the wallet indeed...  This place has been great though, I really enjoy going, the thing is I need to limit myself. I look at it sort of like going out to a nice restaurant, you gotta do it from time to time, but too much of anything is a bad thing...   I find myself regularly spending 100 bucks at a bar between cocktails, shots, etc... If I spend a little more here, say 200, I get hours of entertainment and a chance to make money instead of lose it along with all the benefits of a bar...   Very clean, very nice, cool place to hang! For people visiting, it's a fun night in AZ...  THINGS TO REMEMBER: 1. NO live craps, NO Roulette  2. NO Free Booze with Gambling 3.Cocktail waitresses are HARD TO FIND, grab em when u can! 4.The food out infront of the poker room is actually pretty fucking good! especially for 3AM sloppy hotdog eattage!

I had a great meal here this weekend after having been here several times now. They have really good food, I ordered the Frank's Red Hot Chicken Sandwich, it was delicious. My only gripe was the the Sandwich itself was really tough to eat and kept falling apart because it was several pieces of chicken and the bun got flimsy really quickly... Their sweet potato fries are next level also, be sure you or someone your party orders them, too good...  Reasons I gave it fours stars: -Multiple Good Experiences -Great Food -Excellent Service -Kept very clean  Here are the reasons it isn't five star: -Really expensive for what it is... (still worth it tho) -Decor is a bit cheesy -Layout of restaurant is a bit funky in my opinion, awkward seating...

I went here last night, I was actually pretty impressed. It's a good mix between a bar and a nightclub, not exclusively either one but having the better elements of both. I say this because it has a dance floor and people present themselves well; however, it's not super clubby and has a good bar that is easy to get drinks. I haven't been there for the day crowd, but for a Thursday night it was pretty cracking. I will deffinitely head back there.

I like this place a lot! The food and the atmosphere are both really nice.  Try the chimichanga, I really enjoyed it... Service is great also... The only downsides (from my own experiences) is it seems relatively empty most of the time, and that it is a little on the pricey side... But they justify their prices with good food and REALLY good presentation of the food.

Bison Burger was great, I highly recommend it. Also got the hash side which was excellent. I was in a huge rush and they got me my food in 10 minutes. The ingredients clearly are a good combination, maybe it's just brilliant branding, but it tasted healthier... Cool building too!

I show up at 10 for a 10:30 appt, there's 3 people in the lobby- no one behind the desk. At around 1030 a guy casually strolls in and says sorry guys you're going to have to come back after lunch, we are behind today. Ok- so go grab a subway and be back in 15, right? NOPE- they take an hour and a half lunch break. So I drove down here 45 mins for an appt I had and now have to wait 2 and a half hours.    This place is awful and this is under their NEW management- which is far worse than the already sub-par management that was there before- go elsewhere, these guys are a joke. They act nice and helpful to sign you up, then they have you by the balls and make you pay for it.

Not bad coffee- but the little 'chef' guy needs to learn some manners and respect. I get that you're enthused about your store, but when I mentioned I'm a regular at the roastery in the same mall and was checking this place out, he sighed and said "yeah, they aren't very good". Lesson number 1, don't ever do that.  Bad etiquette and poor taste, followed by watching him interrupt our ordering- flirting with the counter girl and causing her to take almost 10 mins for a latte when place was empty- I will not be returning.  2 stars for patio and a good product- hopefully they can learn some better service, as the roastery has them at this point big time.
