A very cool concept and if I could give a 4.5 star I would. The ONLY downfall is the ledge covers the very bottom of the screen the higher up you sit. The food prices are extremely reasonable for a movie theater.. Great job AMC!

This is the first time I've eaten at Claim Jumper and had a negative experience. Service is always great but they need to take the beef ribs off of the menu. They are uneatable. Not only are the bones the size of dinosaurs bones.. But there is NO meat on them and the little meat that was on them was so tough I almost broke a tooth. I will be back but please decrease the menu items by one. That is all!!

The GF had been raving about this place for sometime now so we decided to go. I must admit, it was all she cracked it up to be. I have NEVER been to an upper high end restaurant that was so crowded you would have thought you were at a TGI Fridays. That just says one thing. The food is AWESOME along with excellent service. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to be undoubtedly satisfied when spending at least $200.00 for two!
