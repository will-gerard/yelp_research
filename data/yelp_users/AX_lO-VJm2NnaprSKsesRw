Great vibe and good times! Was here on a Tuesday of all nights. Karaoke and pool. Great group fun or if you single and ready to mingle. Gotta eat the chicken wings, Moses style! Tonya the Bartender and JR the cook.

What a jerk they are. They advertise free installation if you buy a battery and won't honor it.  Horrible customer service.

The manager Michael attacked me as I was recording an incident outside their night club sat night early Sunday morning. Broke my iPhone. Tells you what kind of worthless employees they must have if the manager loses control. If you want to get in a fight, this is the place to go. Multiple fights throughout the night.  I even emailed the general manager to resolve the issue and of course no response. I will be pressing charges as I have on video the manager attacking me.  Losers!!
