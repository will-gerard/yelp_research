I've had my iPhone 5 screen replace here twice (I know!). Some of the guys are not the nicest but they're good at what they do. I used my Yelp $10 for $20 with no problem.

My daughter started the first day the facility opened and I have been amazed since then!  The facility is beautiful, the teachers are exceptional and then management is amazing and always approachable.  The KiddieCams are great to peek at, the Luvnotes keep me posted on the daily activities, their weekly menu is awesome and the curriculum is outstanding.  I know my daughter is being care for in a loving environment and learning so much!  We love Little Sunshine's Playhouse.

I was pretty excited to try this place. We were told to seat ourselves and someone would come by.... 20 minutes later, I got a walking by waitress and asked her if she could get someone to bring us menus. She was super apologetic. The food was less than decent. I had chicken tacos which was good and a carne asada taco which was NOT, bland no flavor. Service was slow, place was not too busy. Not impressed. Not worth my money, even with the discount I got from Living Social.
