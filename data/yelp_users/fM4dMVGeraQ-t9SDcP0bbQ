I know there's not a lot of love out there for Best Buy, but (recent HP Touchpad fiasco aside) I'm a fan.  Convenient location, clean, well-lit store, friendly, approachable, knowledgeable staff.  I've always been able to quickly and easily find what I'm looking for, and get questions answered.  This location has the Magnolia home theater section, so they've got some of the mid-high-end stuff there.

Sealing Sean S.'s ratings system: Scale of 1-10 (single visit): Food   8 *Drinks*   not rated Service   8 Atmosphere   8 Value  7  I'd heard good things about Rustler's Rooste, so when my mother came to visit over the holidays, it was the perfect excuse to go.  The view at night is fantastic and the restaurant itself definitely has a kitsch factor you don't find any more.  We were seated without a wait, drinks, bread, and meals were delivered promptly, and our server checked in on us enough times so we didn't feel ignored, but she wasn't intrusive.  The cotton candy at the end was a fun surprise.  My one nit pick is that the tables seem to be really undersized, and very close together.  So there literally wasn't enough room for main dishes, sides, the bread and our drinks, and we kept getting bumped into by people at the other tables as well as people walking by.  Maybe it was just a slow night, but it looked like they had plenty of room to take out a few tables, and make the remaining tables a bit bigger and space them a bit further apart.  Overall, I'd go again, and I'd recommend taking friends and family from out of town there for dinner with a view.

Pretty convenient location.  Ample parking.  Free WiFi.  Cheaper than buying books.  Culture Pass ( Free admission for two to a dozen cultural places around the valley: http://phoenix.showup.com/page/culture_pass )  Every person I've run into there has been nice, cheerful, and helpful.

A note to the owners of BJ's Restaurant & Brewery regarding the style of pizza you serve:  I don't know what it IS, but I can tell you what its NOT, and its most definitely NOT 'Chicago-Style'.  How do I know this?  Because up until about a month ago, I called Chicago home for the last 20 or so years.  Pizza has three main ingredients- a crust, a sauce (typically a tomato-based sauce), and cheese (typically mozzarella).  Serving two out of the three does not mean you can still call it a pizza.  This is pass/fail, all or nothing, an you are not graded on a curve; there is no 'E' for effort.  Now some will argue, but typically, 'Chicago-style' pizza has a thick crust and, in at least a couple of restaurants, the sauce and cheese layers are inverted, but the pizza HAS sauce (am I making my point here, or am I being too subtle?).  Do yourself a favor, BJ.  Go to Chicago, and go to Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, Due's, and Lou Malnotti's for a crash course in what 'Chicago-Style' pizza is, then come back here and fix this trainwreck of bread and cheese before you do any permament damage to the phrase 'Chicago-Style Pizza'; well, no more than you've already done.  Your one saving grace is the beer you brew right on premises, otherwise this two-star review would be a one-star review, and I'd never have a reason to darken your doorstep, or subject anyone else to your bread with melted cheese on top.  Keep up the good work on the beer, but fire the guy that came up with your pizza recipe and start over.  Then I may try another one of your pies; until then, I'll just stick to the beer.  Viewing it from that angle, then, BJ's has a nice bar.  Its a bit loud inside for a restaurant, but for a bar, its just fine, and they do have lots of TVs tuned to just about anything you could want to watch.  Come for the beer, stay for the... beer.  But if I've been too subtle, and you missed the point- don't bother with their 'pizza'.

I don't know what I could say about Liberty Market that hasn't been said multiple times already.  But here goes.   The people- helpful, friendly, accommodating.  Always happy to answer a question or to whip up a sample of some tempting little treat.  The menu- exhaustive. I've yet to try something I didn't love. If you can't find something to eat here, then you must work for the competition!  My go-to meal is the Liberty Bowl with pasta.   The atmosphere- kitschy, eclectic. The neon, the colors, the espresso machine (more on that in a bit). Plenty of indoor seating. Nice outdoor patio. Bathrooms that are works of art.   Parking- can be a little rough, what with all of the other businesses there in downtown Gilbert.   The Espresso Bar- Oh. My. Goodness. That E61 espresso machine is older than me- and probably most Yelpers (if not any two combined), but wow does it make a delicious shot of espresso!  If you've never had a Cortadito, I highly recommend giving it a try.  Go to Liberty Market. Do it. Do it now. Thank me later.

I'm just going to come right out and say it: I don't get a lot of "art".  But I also know that if you don't use your brain (the lump of fat three feet above your ass) regularly, it'll atrophy.  Plus, if you're a student in the Maricopa Community College Syatem, you get in for free.  And it's inside, so it's something to do when the mercury starts climbing into the triple digits.  And like so many other things in Phoenix, it's accessible.  Light rail is right there.  Otherwise, parking is a breeze.  So, expand your horizons and go check it out.  You may not "get" a lot of it, you may "like" even less, but I think you'll find something that strikes you that you weren't expecting, and that's kind of the point.  It was with some trepidation I darkened the door of the Phoenix Art Museum with a friend of mine.  Little did I know that we'd actually run out of time, and would end up leaving before seeing everything.  Sure, there was plenty of the modern "art" that I expected, mocked, and asked predictably "how is this 'art'?" derisively, with a hint of sarcasm, while my much more cultured friend just rolled her eyes and shook her head.  Hey, what did you expect, taking me to an art museum?  But I found a lot that- even if I didn't love it, I was able to marvel at the time and effort- the craftsmanship that went into a lot of the collection.  And sometimes, at least for me, you have to respect the amount of detail, time, and care put into getting every last detail just so.  If you ask me, like some kind of cultural Mad Lib, "Do you see the __________ of __________ that the artist intended to reflect in his piece by including __________, __________, and __________, and by choosing to use __________ as his media?  Do you feel the emotions of __________ and/or __________ as the artist intended?" I may just look at you like you have an extra hole in your head, but that doesn't mean I don't like it.  And any art museum that can host an exhibition called "Curves of Steel" about automotive design and the art therein has my vote (and my patronage).  Too bad I missed it.  By 5 years.  But here's to hoping they commission another exhibit about the automobile as rolling sculpture- I'll be there.  And while I'm there, I'll take another look around, and see if I can see what Georgia O'Keeffe was *really* painting when she painted all those flowers (they were women, right?).

All I can say is it must be nice to be a Government-endorsed monopoly.    When I lived in Chicago, I thought ComEd, "An Exelon Company", was bad- sneeze, and the power goes out, constant rate hikes, etc.  I never thought a utility company could be worse.  Then I moved to Arizona, and found myself subject to SRP.  Granted, the power hardly ever goes out- I think I've lost power maybe 3 times since being here.  But they are as bad, if not worse than ComEd and the constant rate hikes.  For what?  Increased profit margins?  You are a public utility- a monopoly.  Why do you need to make a profit?  What are you spending it on and where?  I'm not kidding- I really want to know.  Oh, and don't even think about trying to reduce your energy consumption by installing solar- their incentives are less than half of the rebates from APS.  Which really begs the question- if we already have two power companies here in the valley, why can't a customer choose one or the other?  I'm already on the "time of use" plan, and I'm extreme about it.  Even though I work from home, I keep my thermostat set to 88 degrees from 1:00 to 8:00 PM.  My pool pump doesn't go on until 9:00 PM.  I don't cook inside in the summer.  Laundry?  Only after 8:00 PM, even on the weekends.  No sense in heating up the house, and making the AC kick on any more than it has to.  I'm even thinking of putting in a clothes line- because really, in the land of 110 degree heat and single-digit humidity, do we really need an electric dryer?  Sure, I supposedly "save" money on the Time-Of-Use plan, but my bill is still almost $200 a month in the summer.  So I look into their so-called "Budget Billing" option... my 12-month average works out to be just under $155.00.  Cool, totally reasonable, I guess, but wait- what's this?  To take advantage of their so-called "Budget (Busting) Billing", they want me to pay $260.00 PER MONTH?!?!?! $105.00 per month over my average bill, and $60 over my summer peak bills?  For what?  So you can stick it in the bank, collect interest to pad your profit margin, and still raise rates every year or so?  I have two words for you, and they aren't "Howdy, neighbor".  If I can help it at all, I will not buy another house in SRP's coverage area.  I'll install Solar on my own dime.  And I won't give you free money just so you can keep the interest.  And I'm going to call and complain and expect a credit every time the lights flicker- for even a second.  If I'm going to be held hostage, it's going to be on my terms.

This place is huge.  Huge in a "If we ain't got it, you don't need it" kind of way.  Almost like walking into some kind of high-tech flea market.  I went to Fry's looking to upgrade the RAM in my Mac from 2GB to 4GB.  The parking lot was a mess; people parking any and every way they could (you could barely see the lines anyway- it needs to be repainted at the very least).  Carts were left everywhere- one of my pet peeves, though it says more about their clientele than it does the store.  Anyway, I walked in, an employee gave me the standard 'hi' as I walked in, and that was about it. I wandered around a bit until I finally found the area I was looking for.  The staff there were quick to help me find the right SKU, and printed up a slip for me to bring to the checkout.  A little more wandering around and I began to notice the golf motif, and wondered if the store used to be a Golf Galaxy or something.  I finally found my way to the checkouts, and just remember thinking, "would it kill most of these people to crack the slightest smile?"  Check out, go down a hall where two people are standing to check your receipt, I ask them what the store used to be, they tell me that it's always been a Fry's, they just put in all of the golf-themed tile and wall decorations during a redesign.  Okay...  I walk out wondering what golf has to do with electronics, and notice some other lazy-assed customer left their shopping cart directly in front of my car instead of walking the two whole spots to put it in the cart return.  In summary, they have everything you need electronics-wise (and a whole lot of stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with electronics), the prices are bargain-basement low, many of the employees would just as soon not interact with you if they could help it (and could be replaced by androids with no discernible difference to the customer), and a higher than average percentage of their customers are the selfish/lazy type that ruin it for everyone else.  Not a fan of Yelp's star descriptions; it's not a 1-star, but it's not a 2-star either.  Probably more like a 1.5, or 3 out of 10.  I'll go again, but only if I need something I can't find at Best Buy.

Chase Field is a great venue to catch a baseball game.  It's very walkable.  Compared to Chicago, parking is cheap, and the concessions are very reasonable.  Best of all you can actually afford to buy tickets.  In other words, you can afford to take your family to a baseball game without spending the equivalent of a month's rent in the process.  It's clean, modern, and well-lit.  It's great with the roof open or closed.  And you can hang out in a freaking pool and watch a baseball game!  Plenty of concession stands and bathrooms mean you won't be wandering aimlessly.  After several visits, I can honestly say I've never not had a good time.

Bar none, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  Love the Dilly Club.  Portions are HUGE, almost enough for two, and the homemade bread is as good as it gets.  I've been bringing people from the office here, and they all unanimously agree that Dilly's has the best sandwiches they have ever had, no matter where they are from.  Its a little pricey for a sandwich shop- most combos are just under $10.00, with a drink and a side, which seems a bit steep, but oh so worth it!  Once you go Dilly's, you'll never go back to Subway!

This is my Starbucks.  I don't own it or anything, but it's the closest to my house, so I end up here almost daily.  Location- a little difficult to get to heading east on Elliot, but otherwise the proximity to the I-10 makes it very convenient.  Plenty of parking.  The people are friendly and quick- I've never had an issue where I was made to wait.  One nit to pick- how is it that the Starbucks at Chandler Blvd & 48th (by the Ironwood Library) has marble loaf, but it's "not available for us to order" at this one?  Is this a Starbucks thing?  Corporate versus franchise or something?  Ah, well, Trenta iced coffee sweetened with milk is my go to drink most of the time; they'll refill it with filtered ice water for free, or with more coffee for $.55.  Personally, though, if you enjoy sleep, I don't recommend more than one Trenta iced coffee per day!

NYPD Pizza is New York-style pizza done right.  Much better to the style they try to emulate than BJ's 'Chicago-style, but that's another review.  The thin crust was thin, there was plenty of sauce, and just the right amount of cheese.  The pizza was delicious- 'nuff said.  I would definitly come back again and try some of their 'specialty' pizzas.  The Garlic Knots weren't bad, but they wouldn't be on my list of things to try again.  There was a definite absence of garlic on the garlic knots, and they were covered with sesame seeds, which didn't do much for me (your results may vary).  Have a pint of the NYPD Blonde beer, grab yourself a big, foldable slice, and you're good.  Service was excellent, attentive, and relatively quick.  As for improvement- turn up the 'garlic' flavor on the garlic knots a notch (not too much, but enough so you notice its garlic bread), and hold the toasted sesame seeds... aside from that, you're good!

I'm a fan.  I can't go to Costco and NOT walk down darn near every aisle and see what's new this time.  I get my gas at the Costco Gasoline station- it's consistently and considerably less here than any gas station nearby.  The parking lot is huge, and you'd better be prepared for a walk- I've never seen it not busy.  They do a pretty good job on cart patrol, and most customers are considerate enough to push their carts to a cart return when they are done with them.  The store is clean and bright, and the people are friendly and helpful, and the stuff they sell is quality.  For instance, their Kirkland Signature dog food gets an A+ ( http://members.petfinder.com/~CA469/files/DogFoodRatings.pdf ), it's $25 for 40 pounds, and Peanut has no problems with it.  Before I found the Kirkland Signature food, I was paying $35 for 17.5-pound bags of Nutro, and she was having issues almost monthly.  I bought my TV there.  Pretty hard to argue with an automatic doubling of the manufacturer warranty to 2 years from 12 months.  They take cash, debit cards, and American Express.  Leave your Visa, Mastercard, and Discover Card at home.

I had a small fender bender in a hospital parking lot a few months back.  No big deal, and the other driver's insurance company immediately took responsibility, so all I needed to do was get an estimate and get it fixed.  They were quick but thorough with the estimate, and when I brought my car back for the repair, they found some additional hidden damage, contacted the insurance company, secured a promise from them to pay the shop directly (so I didn't have to pay then wait for the insurance company to reimburse me), and still had everything done as promised, when promised, and they called me a few times to update me on the progress.  The only thing that I would like to see would be some courtesy transportation, even if it would only be offered within a certain radius.  All in all, they made the process as painless as possible.  Strong 9 out of 10; if they offered to drop me off and pick me up at work at no additional charge, it'd be a 10 out of 10.  I hope I don't need a body shop in the future, but if I do, I wouldn't hesitate to bring my car back to Brighton Collision Centers.

A nice, unpretentious place, offering several flatscreens, as well as indoor and outdoor seating, even at the bar.  Sampled two of the beers- the Sunspot Gold, which was good, and the Oscuro, which was better.  I did not try any of the food, so I can't comment on the experiences of the other reviewers.  The staff was extremely helpful and polite; they were no 'slower' than anywhere else I've been so far in Arizona.  In Chicago, they might have gotten marked down a bit, but I'm thinking the pace is a bit different here.  The place was not crowded (not surprising for a Sunday afternoon, I guess), and I'll definitely go back.  Having a nice watering hole this close to home definitely has its advantages.  Plus, they have other beers I need to try!

Interesting place. Expansive menu. They apparently take pride in the ingredients in their food, which is a good thing.  Just don't tell them that you're under any sort of time constraint, as they really don't seem to care, despite the fact that it was mentioned *several* times. I wouldn't recommend it for lunch during the week on your lunch hour, even if "lunch" happens to be 2:00 PM. On a Tuesday.   I'm guessing that the slow service is because they take the time to let your food die from natural causes, painlessly, in its sleep, before cooking it up and serving it to you.   Honestly, I'm kind of disappointed, especially after the rave reviews that friends had given it.  When I checked in, the Yelp app asked me if Hillside Spot was "hipster"; I guess that sums it up. They're not worried about "the man's" bourgeois constructs like "time" and "work".  In short- food... Good. Service... Good. Attention to time constraints... Needs work.

Jersey Mike's is, in my opinion, as good as it gets.  Yes, they have the whole "it all started in 1956 as a family business at the Jersey Shore" thing going for it (you know, before MTV and a half-dozen wannabe D-Listers made anything connected to the Jersey Shore look bad), and they also do a lot for charity; both at the corporate level, and a little closer to home, on the franchise level.  And all that's well and good, but it wouldn't mean anything if the food sucked, right?  No worries there- I've not had a bad sandwich there.  The bread is fresh, as are all of the other ingredients, and it's all sliced fresh when you order it.  It's not like Subway, where they put a slice of meat and a slice of cheese on the sandwiches; they pile it on.  Cold subs, hot subs, wraps- I've enjoyed all of the sandwiches I've tried- not something I can say about some other sandwich shops I've been to.  If I had to pick a couple of favorites, I'd say the #6 (Roast Beef) and the Chicken Caesar wrap.  One nit to pick- I with there were a 3/4 size; sometimes the 'regular' isn't big enough, but the 'giant' is too big.  The parking at this particular location can be a bit challenging at times because it's small and a little tight, but the sandwiches are worth it.  And the Starbucks next door usually has marble loaf in their display case!

If you asked me to name all of the things I missed about Illinois, I might need two hands, but I'd have a few fingers left over.  Jimmy John's, however, would be one of those things I missed.  The employees are great- They're fast, they've got personality, and always have a smile on their face.  They make the bread fresh in the store; sometimes when they hand you your sandwich, and the bread is still warm from the oven?  That's the greatest.  Just hold the mayo (not a mayo fan)!

I don't miss a lot of things about Chicago, but one of the few things I do is being able to walk into just about any bar and see Guinness Draught.  The bottles and cans just aren't the same.  Buffalo Wild Wings gets points *just* for the Guinness.  Otherwise, it's a sports bar.  They have wings and tenders and burgers and mozzarella sticks- bar food, but it's done well.  It's consistent, if not world-changing.  They've got more than enough TVs (flatscreens and and projectors), and lots of beers on tap, including my favorite, Guinness.  Staff is friendly, personable, helpful, and quick.  My server, Maygan, just moved from Peoria University, so we had a bit to talk about.  And unlike the disaster of a parking lot situation that hobbles the Chandler location, it looks like they've got plenty of parking.  And did I mention the Guinness Draught?

Decent dry cleaner, service I done on premises, which is nice, but prices aren't posted anywhere; when I went to pick up my clothes and they told me the total, I thought I heard them wrong. I won't be back.
