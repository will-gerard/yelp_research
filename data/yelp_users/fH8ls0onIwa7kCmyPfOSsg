I can't speak to the quality of their products firsthand (but hopefully will be able to do so within the next year), but after finding the only local jeweler in the area with great reviews, I stopped by Michael's today to examine and polish my grandmother's ring, as well as to offer opinions on resetting it.  I felt very welcome from the moment I entered, and no matter how many (in my opinion, annoying) questions I asked, the man who helped me responded with the utmost care, patience, and attention. I truly felt like I mattered--and it's not like I sauntered in with a designer bag and a huge diamond ring on my finger. I'm just a grad student. You don't get this kind of service at Scottsdale-based local jewelers.  What I think blew me away about my experience is that it turns out (i.e., I learned just today) that my grandmother's ring, which was appraised by a lesser chain jewelry store that shall not be named to be worth more than my (granted, used) car, actually comprised a very low-end stone that could only barely pass as being of quality. I had every intention of resetting this stone in a nice, two-tone band with diamonds--a costly addition--and was instead told that it wouldn't make much sense to polish and reset a stone of this worth.  In other words, they offered full and commendable honesty to a customer who would have easily spent $1,500-$2,000 right then and there, and instead told me the hard truth. I was so impressed with how they handled the situation, and my conflicted emotions that followed.  I also had the chance to look around the store very closely, and am very impressed with the quality and diversity of what I saw. Whereas their website showcases their more experimental, avant garde designs, I can assure you that you can find anything you'd like here. You can also bring a picture (his example: from Pinterest; my example: from Brilliant Earth) and they will recreate whatever you show them with high-quality materials.  Another HUGE plus: all conflict-free diamonds. Do not underestimate the importance of this.  I will definitely be coming back to Michael's--my experience was great, even (or perhaps especially?) considering the quite negative circumstances.

NOTE: This is on the bottom floor of the Hayden Ferry Lakeside building.  I was looking for a coffee shop close to Tempe Center for the Arts for an evening event, and wasn't willing to go through the pains of finding parking off Mill Ave. Parking in front of RTB is, sadly, $1.50/hr (payable only in nickels, dimes, and quarters), but the inexpensive prices at RTB make this well worth it! A small coffee is $1.39, they have cold-brewed toddy, and they did a good job with my iced dirty chai (only $4.42 for two shots and a grande size...about $1 cheaper than Starbucks and just as good).  I didn't have any of their food items, but there is a LOT of variety for such a small shop. Lots of savory options, sweeter options, pastries, desserts, smoothies...you name it. The staff are such a delight--they seem to all be good friends, and were enjoyable to sit around while I worked.  Free Wi-Fi of quite good speed. Owners were very kind and checked in a few times to make sure I was doing okay.  Great outdoor seating--13 tables ranging from 2-person to 8-person tables. Inside there is seating for about 20 people, including comfy chairs.  I'll be coming back, for sure! It's a great study/working atmosphere. Quiet, unobtrusive music (which is hard to find close to ASU's campus), good atmosphere, easy to get to.

I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews here. Don't jump to conclusions if one person had a weird customer service experience--I spent almost my entire morning here, and each and every guy and gal working here was excellent to do business with. I browsed, test rode, left, came back, browsed some more, and frankly bugged the hell out of them, and they were nothing but smiles, laughs, and honest opinions. Had no problem telling me the truth about the quality of bikes, tried to get me to buy a less expensive bike based on my usage (what salesperson ever does that?), and went out of their way to give me a great experience. Ended up buying a beautiful '70s-style American Flyer 700c for an unbeatable price (as are almost all of their bikes, particularly their line of 3G Isla Vistas...new for $169? really?), and they walked me through every step of the process. First month of check-ups free, first year of repairs free, lifetime warranty on the frame. Basic repairs after the first year are so inexpensive it's ridiculous. After cruising around five other bike shops in the Valley, I HIGHLY recommend this place.

I wanted so badly to love this place. The set-up is fantastic, with its Icee-esque alcoholic beverages and some of the best DJs I've heard in Arizona.  I went with a gay couple, and the three of us had just gotten a round of drinks (our first drinks) and were dancing to "Call Me Maybe". One of the guys threw his arms around his boyfriend's shoulders for about two, perhaps three, seconds and immediately went back to dancing solo--and within five more seconds two guards told us that we were "too drunk" and had to "leave immediately". They ushered us out forcibly. We were, of course, completely sober--and when I realized what was most likely the cause of this "drunk" verdict I was so angry I was shaking.  Fat Tuesday, you will never get my service again if you respond to your paying customers with discrimination. I will be telling others about this occurrence.

I was so disappointed with my experience here. I ordered their bruschetta board, which came with only one slice of each kind--I was expecting a smorgasbord akin to what you would receive at Postino for the same price. (Postino, by the way, offers infinitely better bruschetta.) I'm a tiny woman with a tiny stomach, and still left hungry. What's more, their "smoked salmon" bruschetta is actually shredded, cold salmon similar to canned tuna that was so fishy I had to fight back a gag reflex. Because I was still hungry and wanted to get my money's worth, I doused it in someone else's aioli and forced it down. What a bummer...I wanted to like this place.

Very cute place, nice working atmosphere, no loud music (unlike many coffee places in the Valley). Chai is very sweet (be warned), but the rest of the atmosphere and delicious treats make up for it.

Absolutely delicious and unique tacos. I would highly recommend this place. Great salsa bar, secluded atmosphere. I take friends here from out of town to give them a real taste of Mexican food!

The macaroni & cheese bites are TO DIE FOR, as are their chicken 4th st tacos. I highly recommend for atmosphere and people, not to mention décor and location. Our drinks were meh (very sweet, not very strong), but everything else made up for it.

I've been to this location twice in the past two days, and I was a pain in the butt both times (sorry!). Yesterday morning I came in with a coupon on my computer, but not my phone, and the cashier was so patient in trying to help me get my free medium coffee--completely gracious. This morning I placed an order for a few things including a coffee, got out to my car and set my coffee on the roof while I put everything else in the backseat, then...proceeded to drive off with the coffee still on top of the car (well, not for long). I trooped back to DD to pay for another coffee, but they refused to accept my payment and said they'd experienced the same kind of morning before! They were again so gracious, and waved me out happily. Love this place!

An absolutely amazing Valentine's Day menu. Great staff, very quick service, wonderful drinks, food that will blow the taste buds right out of your mouth. Second in the Valley only to Café Monarch (although prices and happy hour are better)...and not by much! Thanks for a perfect evening!

Wow! I was really impressed by this place. I just needed semi-decent Mexican food in the area, and was surprised at how great the reviews were for this place, so I gave it a try (with a 7-person group).  Apparently it's crazy at lunch, and there isn't much seating inside--but we were there from 5:30 to 7 p.m. on a Thursday and it was pretty empty.  The staff are wonderful, and will do whatever to make sure you are customizing your meal to your preference. They offer samples of their different meats.  The guacamole was authentic, but not very flavorful (again, downside of being authentic)--everything else far made up for it. They have a salsa bar, and make your quesadilla/tacos/burrito/whatever you wish right in front of you, adding whichever ingredients you'd like as they go. I got a quesadilla with red chili chicken, which was flavorful and very delicious. The quesadillas are HUGE.  Very low prices.  I'll be back!

I wish I could tell you more about their services, but I can't...because I walked out.  I've never walked out of a service location (hair salon, nail salon, spa center, anything) in my life, and never thought I would. It's rude, it's a diva move, all the bad things. But I don't regret for a second my decision to stand up and just leave.  After reading some pretty great reviews about this place on Yelp (and because I live a stone's throw away), I called to ask if I needed an appointment to come in soon. They said no, they weren't busy and I could walk in within the next hour and be fine. Five minutes later, I had already signed in and was sitting at the bar area. They told me they would be with me shortly. So I sat...and sat...and sat...and sat.  Employees were sitting with me at the bar, chatting and texting on their phones. The music was blasting some of the crudest sex-related lyrics I'd heard outside of a dance club (and I'm not prude--I love me some explicit hip-hop)--we're talking so bad that I was blushing. Husbands, looking as bored as facially possible, were taking up spots at manicure tables and pedicure chairs, fiddling with their phones or magazines while I and other customers sat at the bar to wait our turn.  The smell of the salon is the worst I've ever experienced--so strong that after the first five minutes I started to see spots in the corners of my vision, and was feeling lightheaded. I kept chugging water, hoping I was just dehydrated, but that wasn't the case at all--the fumes were borderline toxic.  After sitting for 20 minutes, and not seeing a single change or hope of receiving service within the next hour, I stood up and left.  I went to Marvel Nails on Rural and Guadalupe, walked right in, and was out with a beautiful gel manicure within 45 minutes. No regrets.

Angels is a fun hang-out, but not among my favorites. I've never had a shockingly great food experience, even with items that would be hard not to like. (For example, I ordered their Casper flatbread the other day, which comprises salami, rosemary, leeks, goat cheese, and a drizzle of honey. Sounds intoxicatingly good, right? They layered no less than 35 slices of salami on that single flatbread, so that you can't even see the flatbread itself. On top, they crumbled a full container's worth of goat cheese--the two flavors were so overpowering that I felt nauseous for the rest of the night, had the rest for leftovers the next day, and felt nauseous all over again.)  What I CAN commend are their homemade, seasonal Poptarts. These things are to die for, particularly their pineapple IPA variety (the strawberry-banana was...meh).  Lastly, their selection of brews is top-notch for this area of downtown, and also for this level of character--although the interior is extremely crowded and loud at virtually all times (whereas their patio feels like a fenced-off parking lot in...well, the middle of downtown Phoenix), I'd take Angels' beer selection and atmosphere over the wider selection and nonexistent atmosphere at the Yard House.

A fun place to go with a few friends; good coffee, good wine selection, good happy hour prices. Great (looking--haven't tried) pastries and deserts. Atmosphere is very much like a warehouse feel, plenty of seating space...but music is far too loud to get work done. This is more a place to socialize.

I sadly can't speak to the cocktails or drinks, but I CAN speak to the space/atmosphere and the INCREDIBLE staff/ownership.  I came in severely dehydrated after a day in the Arizona sun without enough water, and almost fainted in the bathroom. The management immediately welcomed me into their office, gave me everything I could need, and kept checking in on my well-being (despite how embarrassed I was, and how insistent that they not worry about me). They were truly so incredible, and I'm grateful to them--even just from that, who wouldn't want to support this establishment?  The atmosphere is dark and fun. Not at all sketchy...feels divey in the best way. Think of Crescent Ballroom.  I recommend this place!!

I've been to several nail salons around Phoenix, Tempe, and East Mesa, and none have matched up to Marvel Nails (except, perhaps, Tips & Toes at Scottsdale and Curry--they're also quite great). At other salons, I've faced insane waits (when on the phone they promise they're not busy just five minutes before), have been left alone for 30-45 minutes with acetone on my fingers, and have received less-than-par nail services on both hands and feet. I'm not difficult to please (at all), and I won't pretend I know much about nails in general...I might get a mani/pedi once every 6 months, if that. I only go to salons with at least a 4-star rating on Yelp, and still have had some pretty nightmarish stories.  All of that being said, I really do love Marvel. I've walked in looking like a young, moneyless slob and they've treated me like a queen--their younger staff in particular are such a joy to chat with, and they always have fun things on TV. Today I got my gel taken off and a clear coat put on (for protective purposes) in less than 15 minutes from walking in to getting back in my car.  Let me be clear--don't walk in expecting a 5-star resort. But for the price and the location, you really can't do better than Marvel. I drive all the way from Mesa because I always know I'll receive quality service, and they've never let me down.

We strolled into The Whining Pig in search of a good time and a nice atmosphere, and were far from let down! It's a nice, intimate setting with fun décor, great games, awesome staff, and a huge selection of beers and wines. They offer flights of wine suited to your tastes, and we could easily have spent hours in there! Also, the music is rockin. Definitely give The Whining Pig a try--you'll be glad you did!

Cupcake-wise, this place is great--$2.50 for a cupcake with $1 happy hours Saturdays from 1 to 2. The pumpkin is great, as is the white-chocolate cranberry. The chef is very nice and so happy to share more information about each unique creation. The atmosphere is hit-or-miss...there are a few little tables, and around the corner is a tiny nook that feels like something out of Pinterest. Not a place for getting work done, but possibly for chatting with friends. The music drove me insane within minutes, however--I'm not sure if this is the norm, or just a weird Halloween mix for 5-year-olds--but I had to leave after eating instead of staying to get some work done.

I've only been here for an hour and already love this place! I've been in search of a coffee hangout close to campus for a long time, but a place that isn't overrun with undergrads (Cartel), too loud and fast-paced (Starbucks), limited in their selection (Gold Bar), far too small (Solo Café), or just kinda gross (Xtreme Bean).  Found it! Infusion is quiet, offers a ton of coffee and food options, has great areas to sit and work or chat with friends, and is bright and open.  DOWNSIDES: (1) Potentially space; 7 chairs at a "bar" area facing the street, 4 chairs at a table in the center of the space, and a cool wraparound couch with center table that might seat 10. There IS an outdoor patio with umbrellas and much more seating space, right off 8th St. (2) Outlet availability; I only see one available outlet, and it's not too close to a seat (with an extension charger you could make it, but only from one seat)--come here on a full charge if you plan to work!  UPSIDES: Very friendly staff. I was overwhelmed by their coffee selection and coffee-making methods (e.g., Aeropress, Chemed, pour-over, French press, and the list goes on and on). They also have a ton of tea. All coffee, tea, and "making methods" (previously listed) are available for sale. They offer coffee from Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Bolivia, Brazil, Burundi, Ethiopia, El Salvador, and Indonesia.  Their breakfast options include: Parfait, Irish oatmeal, continental, crêpes, French toast, hash browns + eggs + bacon/sausage, eggs + artichoke + feta, eggs + brie + apple + bacon/sausage.  Their lunch options include: SALADS (strawberry, bacon, spinach; gorgonzola, pear, spinach; house tabouli; citrus quinoa; caprese) and PANINIS (prosciutto & pear; balsamic glazed chicken; caprese; paddy-o grilled cheese).  They also have daily chef's specials with additional options. I had the parfait (see photos) and it was absolutely delicious. I'm guessing this place is of Irish origin (although you can't tell from the décor)--they have an Irish blessing hanging from the wall and a clock set to Ireland time.  Very, very neat atmosphere, very laid back, great place to work. I'm glad I came!
