The key here is to go in when they open their ovens baking some of their excellent pastries. I never leave without getting a freshly baked crossiant or churro. My wife introduced me to La tolteca and we have been making regular trips back ever since. We started out with breakfast burritos on weekend mornings and I have now fit it into my drive home from golfing for some tacos. Both of the aforementioned are excellent.   It is really hard to find authentic homemade Mexican food and this place does it perfectly. I was convinced when I had my Mother-in-law's homemade rice and tacos that it was the best their was. I am not saying that Tolteca is better but it actually tastes close to the same.   A little hint: Once it cools down a little bit, fall and winter months, they have a huge charcoal grill setup in the parking lot on weekends. You can get cooked whole chickens and full racks of ribs for around 8 bucks. They also cook fresh green chiles. A great alternative on game days when you don't have time to setup the grill before the game starts. Just run down and pick something up fresh off their grill!

I had Luke's last night and must say it was pretty good. Being from Chicago I always frequent places in the valley that advertise being a Chicago Style. This place can say it is a Chicago Style.   Dripping Beef Sandwiches, Polish Sausages and homemade peppers pretty much makes up the menu and that is what makes it Chicago Style. A simple menu with good meat and peppers on it. It has a hole in the wall authentic feel but it is a very clean place.   I would definitely eat here again for a good beef sandwich with Mozzarella.

What a joke. We recently moved to this area of Phoenix and thought we would try it one night after seeing the sign that it was on the food network walking out of Sprout's. They charge $3 for bread and it is four small slices of stale french bread. The two pasta dishes had no real sauce or flavor and the prices are ridiculous.   It was $32 for two pasta dishes and bread. I am so angry right now that I didn't go with my gut feeling and just go to Mamma Mia's. Mamma Mia is similar in price but offers twice the portion and you get the bread for free like a normal Italian Diner. I think this might be the angriest I have ever been after eating dinner out.

This place definitely has an upscale loungy feel to it. The only way I found out about it is because I work right in that area. I can see how it would be a nice change of pace from the typical clubs around the valley. It would be a good place to start the evening and maybe impress some people visiting from out of town.   Think of a place you would see in L.A. or Chicago. I have been to places like this in each of these cities, dark, swanky, cool, hip. My secret hint for this place is that you can see certain Suns players come in late at night to hang out.

Old school, classic feel. I searched high and low for the type of barbershop you see in the movies where the mobsters are getting the shave and shoeshine. I finally found it in V's.   They actually do the shave with a straight blade and the hot towel and shoeshine are complimentary with your cut. I would reccomend V's to any guy looking for a good cut in an atmoshpere where you feel like a local magnate in the community.

I just stopped by Hap's to pick up some ribs and chicken for the first NFL game of the year. I have eaten here once before and forgot the great smoked taste that all of their meats have.   I would compare it to something like a Shane's Barbecue, not really a hole in the wall type barbecue spot but definitely small and very clean. I think the meat has a much better taste than Shane's, more of a smoked taste rather than relying on the sauce for the taste.   I would say this is more of a pick-up type place and for sure a place to get some family sized meals for a small party or during a game.

I have been meaning, for some time, to write a review on Mamma Mia since I have picked up Pizza there about 20 times. It still isn't the Chicago deep Dish I yearn for but it has all of the qualities of a Non Chicago style Pizza I search for: Fresh Ingredients, Great Sauce, Big Slices and a Crispy bottom (but not too thin, more pan size)  We got some Ziti last night for the first time instead of just pizza. The pasta really shows how good they make their gravy. It has a little bit of an addicting taste to it.   This is more of a take out place but the staff is always friendly and know how to bake pizza's. It is on my top 5 list of pizza's in the valley.

This place is as good as it gets. A true man's hangout. Don't think that women can't go to this secret hideout that men go to though. Every time I see a woman here I think she must be in an elite group of the classiest women in the world.   This place has every type of liquor, wine, beer and cigar possible. What makes it even better is that everyone who works here somehow knows everything about all of these countless products. They have now opened the greatest "REAL" bar attached to the greatest "REAL" Cigar and liquor store.   Join their e-mail list right away as they have great beer, wine and liquor tastings. I used to go here all the time when I lived in NoPho however now I live in the Papago area. I always stop by when I am up that way for a Dogfish Head or whatever Amar (very cool, knowledgeable and intriguing owner) recommends.   Think of the most expensive, elite club you can join and this would be their secret hangout, with the most knowledgable and friendly staff. Then throw in every type of whisky (I mean every, not like some wanna be Scottsdale bar), a few Plasma's with the game on and you have this cool hangout.   Don't be fooled by the same old strip mall exterior. It keeps the million dollar bar hidden for only those who know about it.

I was a little surprised by the negative reviews but as I read them it made me realize, maybe Sushi Brokers doesn't have the greatest service. I guess I never noticed because I always go for happy hour and am really looking forward to the Diamondback roll and a few Saki Bombs. That being said the service isn't really that bad.  The prices are good for happy hour and are actually a little high regularly. I enjoy the atmosphere and they usually have ESPN on the couple of plasmas scattered around.   The ideal night would be start at Sushi Brokers for a few rolls and saki during happy hour then get on with your plans for the rest of the evening.

I took my wife here for her birthday about two weeks ago on a Friday night. No problem getting in without reservations. This restaurant is in the cool remodeled Firesky hotel. I would describe it as a really modern type lodge. Think West Elm meets Aspen.   The food was excellent. Everything here is very fresh and they try to use organic ingredients when they can. I could tell it would be smaller portions (that is why I gave it four stars instead of five) but it worked out because we started with the best Margarita Pizza I have ever had. I haven't been to Pizza Bianco but I don't know how it could be better than this. Don't get me wrong I am from Chicago, love deep dish, and nothing is better than an Uno's pizza but you don't order Margarita pizza's in Chicago you order them on the west coast.   The waiter was very attentive to us and our main courses were excellent. He actually recommended my main course and the bottle of wine we ordered over what we were originally thinking. He even explained his reasoning for the recommendation. I really like when waiters take pride in their restaurants offerings.   I would definitely eat here again. Think very fresh food in a cool fresh atmoshpere.

I hate to give a bad review but we had a pretty paltry experience at Kabuki. We knew we wanted to try a new place for Sushi and instead of using Yelp reviews we used the convenience of Tempe Marketplace, big mistake. With all of the new Sushi places and good reviews on here I wish we wouldn't have wasted the time or money at Kabuki.   We sat at the bar and I wouldn't blame all of the bad experience on the bartender. There was one for the entire bar and for the entire restaurant (making all of the drinks for the servers as well). Therefore, it took a good 10 minutes of us sitting in front of him for him to ask us what we wanted to drink. We ordered 3 items about 30 minutes into being there. After being there for about an hour we received one item that we ordered then 10 minutes later received one more and one that we didn't order. We said we would just eat it but instead they put in for our original order and stored the Sushi in a fridge under the bar (whomever orders that roll next is not going to get it rolled fresh).    The good thing was that it wasn't terribly expensive. $6-$10 for a roll and I think around $8 or $9 for a Sake Bomb. It just took us close to two hours to eat at the bar and the food wasn't really that amazing. I hate giving bad reviews, maybe I will change it to 3....no I will leave it at 2. If we ever stop in again and it is better I will definitely raise my star rating.

I really enjoyed this new trendy pizzeria. Good beer selection, good pizza, decent prices all in a clean modern atmosphere. Smaller pizza's for you to try a few different ones and maybe share with friends. I didn't make it for happy hour but it looked like a pretty good happy hour for drinks. Also they had PBR which is always a good sign in my book.    The only reason I am giving it four stars and not five is because I didn't get a pizza with tomato sauce. My wife and I had two specialty pizzas. I base my review of a pizza place on their signature tomato sauce. I may go tomorrow for lunch to try just a regular pizza with tomato sauce and may upgrade my rating to five.
