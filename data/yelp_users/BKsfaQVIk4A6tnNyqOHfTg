only 1 word to decribe this place. BLAND!! The iced lemon tea has no flavor. the curry squid is watered down. the portugede style chicken rice has olives and celery in it. so not right!!  Color is wrong and bland!!. maybe I am being too critical. But I can drive a few miles to Asian Cafe Express and get better food. I have to admit they just opened and I will try again in a couple weeks.
