Was really really really busy on sunday for dim sum but still everything was sooooo good, expect the duck. If it wasn't for the duck I would have given the place 5 stars. I highly recommend the shrimp dumplings, noodles, and pork & corn dumplings. Great staff, friendly and reasonable price.

I just had my husband's car detailed for his birthday and I cannot tell enough people how AWESOME it looks. It was HALF the price of dealer doing it, and they came to us! It looks better than new! THANK YOU SCOTT! It looks so good and the price was soo soo good I just want to scream it from the mountain top!

So we got carry out from here, and when I walked in it smelled funny and I was worried. I should have been, because the food was AMAZING! Shaved noodles in OX tail soup was to die for, as were the steam dumplings of heaven! My husband got the hand drawn noodles in XO sauce and just loved it. Really good price too! I recommend the shaved noodles myself for a yummy chewy noodle, but the hand drawn weren't anything to sneeze at.  I would like to eat in, you can watch the chef prepare the noodles which sounds fun!
