My friend and I came here per her suggestion (her having been there a few years back and my first time) and we had a blast! We arrived early for the antipasto appetizer and drinks in the bar. The owner was the bartender and was very nice and friendly. We saw Bridesmaid, which was hysterical and the food was not bad at all. You could tell it was all made fresh there. I ordered the steak, although a little overcooked, still perfectly edible. We ordered the popcorn at the end, air popped with REAL butter! It was delicious. A little dated decor (but still great!), but it was clean and comfortable. We had such a wonderful time and will absolutely go back!!!

Yes! Yes! Without ever being to NYC, this is THE best bagel I have ever had! Small, family run bagel shop serving breakfast and lunch. They have boars head meats, fresh made bagels daily, great fast service and amazing bagels! I had a sesame bagel with egg (fresh cracked egg) provolone, bacon and tomato with cream cheese on the side. Hits the spot!! If you live in the area this a must go to breakfast and lunch place! Monday through Friday from 5:30am to 11am for $5.25 you can get a breakfast bagel sandwich and coffee/drink! When I lived here I came here often and was anxious to return to have another bagel sandwich!! Great little patio to sit at and have coffee with a small view of the mountain. Can't beat it!!

Went to Tags last night for my birthday with my friends and family and had a great time! The pace of meal was perfect, plenty of time for talking and enjoying ourselves! Had the chicken parm, it was ok, not crispy though! Next time we will eat the one on 59th because I remember the food there being better, we shall see! Service was fantastic and food is pretty good for the price! Must have the mascarpone cake!

If anyone says this place is decent or good obviously has not had good pita sandwiches. The prices were ridiculous regardless of location, skimpy portions and seriously lacks in flavor. Had the Gyro and Falafel. Will never return.

Seriously 5 stars for ambiance! This place is very original since it was an old house turned into a restaurant. The garage is actually the bar, but it does not have a garage feeling or look. Had "quite a few" of the Horny Margaritas and they were delish! Fresh squeezed citrus juice with sugar water they actually make. They know how I do margaritas! Had the fish tacos, simple, but so fresh and tasty. The prices are on the higher end, but it shows in the quality of food, location and decor/ambiance, etc. The service was decent, nothing spectacular, but certainly not bad either. Never felt rushed, very relaxing and enjoyable! Great spot to have a nice fresh meal, few adult beverages and excellent conversation!

The good, the bad and the, well, good. I have wanted to come to this event for the past few years and Adam Richman making an appearance sold me this year. (I have a little crush on him) For a double whammy, my favorite Irish band was also playing, Keltic Cowboys. For those two things alone, I give 5 stars. Filled with beautiful, plastic people dressed in 6 inch heels and long dresses in 100 degree weather eh, 2 stars (only in Scottsdale). Yikes. Food was pretty decent actually (had BBQ), however I was actually thinking in my head I would see a little more original culinary action instead of prepared chain food. It was not bad I guess, maybe I had too high of expectations. But either way, it was still a decent time. Overall, I didn't see a value for my money because it was wicked expensive once you get inside. BTW, where were the food trucks?? I never could find them and I really wanted to check those out. The event needs some work before I will go back. What a bummer.

After a long, stressful day, I was craving a hot fudge sundae after dinner with real ice cream (not dairy queen). I live down the street from the Sugar Bowl so that is where I headed. I need that little pick me up and smile that ice creams brings me. Apparently, I went to the wrong place. They were out of whipped cream....you can't have a hot fudge sundae without whipped cream!! I had to ask for nuts and then when I went to pay at the cashier cage the guy NEVER looked at me, said anything to me and NEVER even thanked me. What is going on???? Talk about ruining my evening! Maybe I went with my hopes to high, but is it too much to ask for a thank you?? I paid almost $7 for a sundae with no whip cream, no smile and a big bowl of irritation. THANKS!

We took my mom here for her birthday tonight and we really, really enjoyed it. The place was very clean, nice looking and super friendly, professional service (thanks Nick!!!). Alot of guests seemed like they knew each other and the staff, so it had a very homey and welcoming feel. They had an extensive wine list, too bad they didn't have a Moscato (my new favorite), but we ordered the Riesling instead, which was still wonderful. I had the Chicken Saltimboca, mom had the braised beef and her husband had the Eggplant Rollintini. Everything was very tasty. Not greasy, heavy and over salted. Just real flavors of all the food. They also bring out the best garlic bread, I must have ate 8 pieces! The cannoli was made exactly how it should be made and the tartufo was excellent along with an Illy espresso. YUM!! What a very pleasant dining and food experience. I will definitely be back!

I just have to tell you that this place is amazing. Not only is the food top notch so is the service. It is a rare find to get awesome food, a comfortable environment and excellent service at a reasonable price all rolled into one. The homemade sausage is excellent, the pizza is perfect, the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads (red potato dill is my favorite) and everything on the menu is fantastic. I have read that people say the wait is long, (which I find unfounded) but when you are considering what you are getting, the wait means nothing. I have waited longer for Sysco reheated food in a restaraunt (bleh) and had worse service. I would take a 10 min longer wait for really good, fresh food any day. If you can't appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay. We really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like Defalco's is really tough. We will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat. Don't pass the opportunity to try this place!!

Seriously? The person that runs this place is genius. I must find a way to copy your entire idea and move it to a beach for myself. I thought I walked into my own dream when I came in here. I haven't been to Lux in about 1.5 years and since then it has moved into the building next to the old one, tripled in size and is the most delicious, eclectic coffee experience I could ask for. Looking for fresh hand roasted coffee on site, check! Fresh made unique pastries, check! Fresh, gourmet-like food, check! Handmade from fresh (and I mean FRESH squeezed juice) mimosas, check! I can go on....I could not ask for a better place to be a part of my life. Thank you heaven for waiting for me to find you.

I have wanted to eat at Haus Murphy's for years! Finally I was able to check this place out on my last visit to AZ. Although it was featured on Food Network, I was a little disappointed. Come prepared with Tums to naw on after you eat too. I left with the most wicked case of heart burn! I was expecting a more authentic feel to the enviornment and it was lacking. The food was ok, I had the pretzel crusted schnitzel, mashed potatoes, red cabbage and spaetzle. It was a little bland and had a lot of grease! I have had better German food with better ambience and the service was a little to be desired. I am glad I finally went, but I will look elsewhere for German food in the future.

I have fretted writing a review on this place because at times, I do come here, even though I don't really like it. I know it sounds crazy, but there is not a Starbucks in a five mile radius of where I live and this is the only coffee shop around that has quick access (Finding my way through Westgate at 6am is not an option). Coffee desperation can sometimes equal sacrifice, what can I say. The staff is never friendly to me, even though I see them chatting it up with other customers. I never seem to get that same service, even though I have been going there off and on for 5 years. I have tried the tipping thing, but to no avail. It's as if they know my true loyalty lies somewhere else and I am only going there out of desperation. Oh and did I mention there absolutely ridiculous prices? If you ever thought Starbucks was expensive, think again compared to this place. They actually have drinks on their menu that top the $7 mark. Are you serious?! The coffee is not even that good and the sugar free vanilla has a terrible after taste. My Friday afternoon coffee date with my best friend will no longer be here because we just can't do it anymore and will drive out of our way to the Starbucks. Such a shame because it is a great location for me and I am guilty of a daily visit at Starbucks. My money will still go to Starbucks where I always get excellent service and delicious coffee.

Do not go here for fingerprint services! I went to this location to have my fingerprints done for a fingerprint clearance card for school. This store advertised this service for $20 so I chose this store to have my fingerprints done. When I arrived at the store and told the clerk what I needed, she handed me a small square ink pad and told me to roll my fingers on the ink pad and then on the paper. She then charged me $20 and I was on my way. I know nothing about fingerprinting, I assumed they did. 3 weeks later my card was returned to me because of the poor job I did. Well, big surprise. I lost critical time for this time sensitve document. Who advertises this service but does not actually provide the CORRECT service? I went to the police department to have this done and it came out much darker and clearer and was obviously done properly by a trained professional. Please stop offering this service since you are not trained on how to do fingerprints!!!!!  I called the store to let them know of the situation and the clerk seemed way too busy to really listen to me, didn't seem like he cared much and told me to bring my receipt in and have it redone. Oh yeah, that's what I want to do, lose another 3 weeks of time on my time sensitive document. Not a happy camper over here with this store.

We decided on Margaritaville since the Yardhouse was a 45 minute wait and we were heading to the hockey game on Valentines Day. There was not a wait at Margaritaville, no longer wondering why. The service was terrible and the food quality is very poor. We probably would have spent less and had better service and received the same quality food as Burger King. The food clearly tastes like it came off the Sysco truck and was merely heated up in their kitchen. We also waited 40 minutes for our food and had to flag down a manager just to get our check. Ordered 2 iced teas for $6??? Boring food and boring service, will not return unfortunately.

WOW! WOW! WOW!! My mom always raves about Chompie's so I made her take me. I also wanted to try the Jewish sliders Adam Richman ate on Man vs. Food. Absolutely totally delicious!! Also had the matzo ball soup, a must have! They have quite an extensive menu, all fresh made on site and totally delicious!! You won't go wrong with anything you order! Heard the whitefish salad is amazing, will try that next!

My sister and I went to Salty's for Cinco de Mayo. We actually had a great time! The place has a lot of open space, I love how it's like a big backyard party with all the amenities! The food was simple, but totally tasty (chicken burrito). Service was pretty good. We were lucky we got there early because there was a huge line later in the evening and they were only letting people in as people left. I would have personally never waited that long to get in. Margaritas were cheap and gave the typical heart burn from the pre-made mix, but we had a good time!

OMG - this place is amazing. I am not sure if I have words, but I will try. I can't believe places like this exist. A place with fresh made everything from scratch?? YUM. I am a traditional girl, so I opted for a hot fudge sundae with pecans and madagascar vanilla. UH-Mazing. I also tried the mint chocolate chip (my 2nd fave), complete heaven. Made with real, fresh mint, you can totally taste the difference. I also tried the Desert Honey Sorbet since I love our local honey. Again, UH-mazing. I am seriously impressed since I am grossed out by Dairy Queen and not happy with the Sugar Bowl. I drove farther and spent more and totally worth it.

I have never had Thai food before but it has always been on my food radar. We found this restaurant down the street and decided to give it a try with my Mom. It is in a shopping plaza and decorated very "Thai-ish" on the inside as well so it was very comfortable and relaxing. We had the jasmine tea which was awesome! I have become a tea lover recently and this was very tasty addition to our meal. We ordered the wonton soup, the coconut curry, pad thai noodles and a ramen type of soup as well. All of it was VERY TASTY. I was very impressed with the service and the freshness of the food. All of the food came out hot as well and served promptly. I have nothing else to compare it to though, but this was a great experience for my first Thai food!

I have not been to Carabba's in over 4 years and I am kicking myself now! We had a wonderful dinner and would eat here again in a heartbeat! Very friendly and professional staff from the beginning to the end. Started off with fried zucchini appetizer, it was fried light and crispy with fresh zucchini, not frozen. Then we had Caesar salad and all 3 of us each ordered Marsala. One chicken, one sirloin and one pork chop. Lucky for me I was able to taste test each one and picking a favorite would be impossible. Fresh sautéed green beans as well, where do you ever get that? There is a unique divineness on the grilled meat, possibly hickory? I am a fan. Let me tell you about the delectable dessert with vanilla ice cream (I wouldn't be surprised if they made it fresh), caramel and these cinnamon coated walnuts? WOW. Diet? What diet? I went to a parallel universe while that graced my lips. The pace of meal was perfect, never feeling rushed and even the manager stopped by for a visit. I must say for a chain restaurant this topped my charts, completely blew past the Odive Marden....? Just can't remember the name of that place anymore....hmmm. One other point is that I wouldn't say the portions are HUGE like most cheap chain restaurants, but I still left completely full and not grossed out stuffed. I HATE that feeling from cheap over processed food.

Same compliments I sent to the restaurant as well:  This was our first visit to Brio and we were so impressed. Everyone was so friendly and warm and our server, Alicia was fantastic. She described the menu to us with great detail and almost making it hard to decide because everything sounded so good! We were so grateful Alicia told us about the Summer special (Chicken Milanese and Lasagne) helping make it easier to decide since it was such a good value. She was so knowledgable about everything the restaraunt offered, the menu and how the food was prepared. Way more than we could have asked for, but such a pleasant surprise. I don't usually expect spectacular service at restaraunts, but typically decent at least. She blew me away with her service skills. I am so happy about this awesome experience, excellent service and delicious food. I can't wait to tell my friends, post on Yelp and come back to visit! Thank you so much! Worth every penny I spent in your restaurant tonight!

Went here last night for some food after work with a work friend. We had a really good time! Lots of big, flat screen TV's with all the games on, great drink specials and good food so far! I had a grilled chicken sandwich with fresh cut fries and homemade ranch...YUM. Friend had fish tacos and she raved about them. Will definitely go back! Great find!

Went to Tuscan Oven for mother's day with my mom, her husband, aunt and grandmother. We had a terrific time! The food was great, fresh, hot and delicious. The service was also fantastic. We started off with the stuffed gnocchi's, YUM. Then caesar salad and I had the homemade fettucine pasta with alfredo, chicken and broccoli. The pasta was cooked perfectly and everything was delicious! Mom had the meatloaf, grandma had the shrimp scampi and my aunt had the rockfish. Everyone loved their food. Tasted very fresh! We love eating outside of chain restaraunts and really enjoyed the service and food we had today. We even stayed awhile after and were never rushed out. We really enjoyed our entire experience and look forward to eating there again!

I haven't been to a Jamba Juice in years and thought what a nice alternative to coffee for today. When I walked in to check out the menu it was completely different then what I remember. Nothing wrong with change! I went with the Orange/carrot smoothie and my mom followed suit with the same drink. The person preparing our beverages struggled with the juicing machine which I found odd since it's the main thing they use for making their juices. When we received our drinks they were two completely different shades of orange. We ordered the same drink so something went wrong in the portions of ingredients. End result I felt the service was poor, took way too long, overpriced = not that impressed. I would try another smoothie place before going back to this place anytime soon.

This is the best frozen yogurt I have ever had. So many flavors and toppings to choose from, it's heaven. It's so cold and really cools you off after walking around Mill Ave. I was introduced to Red Mango while in Washington DC and absoloutely love it. I was ecstatic to find we had one in Tempe, AZ. Since I was craving Red Mango today, my friend and I headed over to Mill Ave to try the AZ version of Red Mango. Everything was great! Clean store, friendly staff and plentiful choices of toppings. However, the fruit pieces are WAY too big for your cup. Smaller pieces would be easier to eat and more joyful to have a small taste in more bites. Maybe they could work on that, but it was still great!

Came here during happy hour for a friends birthday before a D-Backs game and we had a great time! Great selection of beers, great service, great ambiance and awesome location! It's great to see a place like this (and the whole dining center) finally going up in downtown Phoenix!

What a fantastic new restaurant!! This area really needs a place like this! I was with my family walking down Glendale Ave when we ran into the owner, Tom. He came up and started talking to us about his new place down the street. He was so friendly so we instantly had to check this new place out. What an excellent decision it was! Immediately upon entering I saw the copper mugs and knew they served moscow mules. Tom told us about their house made fig infused vodka for the moscow mules and we quickly ordered 3. Extremely well crafted and absoloutely delicious!! I could have easily down 3 of those! Since we were heading to Haus Murphy's after our cocktails for dinner, we only ordered an appetizer. We ordered the meat/cheese/olive plate and wow oh wow!!! It was only $10 and well worth it. 3 of us split it and it was a perfect snack with our moscow mules! The staff was incredibly friendly and talkative as well. Tom gave us a tour of the restaurant as well. He showed us the original brick wall towards the back, which was a very nostalgic touch to leave in the place. The patio wasn't quite finished, but it will be awesome once done! Love the beautiful iron gate! Hopefully this new place gets the recognition it deserves and more people come to check this out! Glendale definitely needs a cool place like this! Tom made us feel so welcome and privileged too to be a part of this new establishment!!
