I have celiac disease and usually don't have an issue with Chipotle. However, today at this location the girl was a complete mess. She didn't understand what celiac disease was, my specific instructions or the need to change her gloves. It wasn't even busy, I won't ever be back. I'm extremely annoyed that I can't eat a simple corn taco without getting sick. Step up your game, Chipotle.

I have had nothing but horrible experiences with Sullens & Euchner. To name a few things: they have changed my lease terms and neglected to notice the documents in my file that state 'my rent will not increase', they have lost the master key to my house at the property management office three times which ultimately ends in maintenance not showing up or notifying me of the key loss until weeks later, the maintenance team is horrendous and has neglected to fix a hole in my shower, plugged shower drains and broken washer/dryer for weeks at a time and to top it all off they won't refund me for any of the costs associated with a laundromat (hard to find in north Scottsdale) or plumbing expenses associated with the bathroom problems.   In short, I would think twice about using this company to manage any property and as a renter I will never rent a property that is managed by Sullens & Euchner again.

I bought a Living Social deal because I needed a quick eyebrow wax and a brazilian that was close to my house. I went on my lunch break and Jessica was amazing. I've had a lot of waxes and her services were by far the best. Quick, professional and very detailed. I will definitely come back! :)

I stopped in today on my lunch break and had an amazing $10 manicure with Tracy. This salon is right next to Sprouts and opened two months ago. I will definitely be a repeat customer. I am going back tonight for a pedicure with a hot stone massage for only $18. Great price, great location, great service. VERY impressed!

I LOVE this SALON! My hairstylist, Ambre, is amazing! I started going to her a couple of years ago when she was at Dolce and I have never been happier. I would recommend her services to anyone and everyone!   Brush is a brand new, boutique salon that caters to their clients every needs. The atmosphere is stunning and all of the stylists are amazing, not to mention the location is perfect! I love this salon and will continue to come back.

Came across Isabel's randomly and was pleasantly surprised. I have celiac and this place is very GFREE friendly. Great atmosphere and food. I will be back.

Lexis is very friendly and makes you feel at ease, which is hard to do when you're getting a Brazilian. She was quick and helped me forget about the pain. I'll definitely be back.
