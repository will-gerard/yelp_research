We have visited this location 3 times. Generally, the service is not good however the food is not bad. However, on our most recent visit we had ordered the Chicken Fettuccine dish. To our surprise the chicken pieces were not fully cooked. We had showed the waiter a piece of chicken that was taken from this dish and it was mushy and pink. Definitely, not cooked. The manager came over and removed the dish from our bill. However, that was the least of my worries. My husband unfortunately now has food poisoning from the chicken. The good news is that the manager gave us a coupon for a complimentary appetizer. How kind...

Worst customer service. I've visited this location numerous times as it's located near my office. Each time I've visited they're either understaffed, food order is incorrect or they're just plain rude. Not worth the effort.. I'll go elsewhere.

I have been a long time weekly customer of this car wash. There have been a few instances where the wait was a little long.  However, today they lost a customer, "Me". I took my car for an oil change and wash to discover my IPOD was stolen from my center console. The first indication was when I turned my tuner back on and it stated, "No connection".  I quickly looked in the center console to discover it had been gone through and was a mess. There was a disconnected charger and no IPOD. I should have removed it from the car but on the other hand, I should not have to. I reported it to the manager and he could care less. He gave me a 10% discount card. How nice of him...

I reached out to the community about the incident... apparently I am not the only one. Please see the comments below. I have also filed a complaint with the BBB.  1) I stopped going there when they stole the quarters out of my tray!  no big deal of course as far as the loss!  i phoned the manager when i got home and he said nothing he could do.  i said i just wanted you to know you hired a thief.  funny thing is when i was called and walked to the car, i handed the girl $2 and she had the guiltiest look on her face.  i didn't get it at the time!  glad you sent out a notice to everyone on this!    2) We had started to go there when we first got in town - but realized that our car  would be out of sight for too long of a length of time and we had just driven from Seattle and had lots of valueable in our car.  Besides we noticed how the workers kept watching us which made us feel very uncomfortable.  We changed our mind and I am glad we did.  I am so sorry to hear about what happen to your daughter.  However if I were her I would write a letter to "Better Business Burea." (?) I am sure that she is not the only one that this has happen too.  Others need to see what happen to her posted elsewhere.  That will affect their business. I think that she would be surprise to find that this has happen to many more people.  That's if this company is a member of "BBB."   ***NOTE*** This car wash is located on Dysart/McDowell in Avondale, AZ***  They sold a groupon a week ago for $29.00.. BUYER BEWARE!!!!

What a great place!  I've been going here for the past year about twice per week.  The facility is always clean and the staff is friendly.  The concept of this theater is nothing but fun. They have a bar located in the lobby with seating if you choose to have a drink while waiting for friends. You can take your drink with you in the movie if you do not finish it.  There are "2" theater types. Fork N Screen permits children where "Cinema Suites" only permits 21 and over. Both serve the same food & drink menu. The Fork N Screen has more seating but the seats do not recline where the Cinema Suites are far more private and the seats recline. I love the little red help buttons next to each seat if you need service, hit the button and voila... they show up! The food is average, the apps are pretty good, and the drinks are fun. There are really good restaurants located in the Esplande if you choose to have dinner elsewhere and then see a movie.  They also validate for parking for 4 hours!  Overall, this is a great spot for a night alone, date night, girls night, or a family afternoon. AMC also has a stubs program ($12.00 year) I use it to earn points and free dollars to use.

Excellent service and great food!  The prices are just right and they have a punch card for a free drink and free lunch.  I love the Chicken Yakisoba Noodles... a favorite!

If there were 10 stars for this location, It would be granted!  I go here everyday Monday through Friday. A great way to start my day and sometimes a nice refreshing treat in the afternoon.  I always have the best service, they know me when I walk in the door and my drink is ready before I even have a chance to swipe the "Gold" card. Always a friendly staff with a warm smile.

Great patio setting! Unfortunately, the brunch fell short. Great brunch menu, plating of food was beautiful; however the taste of the food was bland. Our waiter was great though, super nice guy!  I have had dinner at this place before & it was pretty good. I think I'll steer clear of their brunch & will stick to their dinner.

Awesome service!! Great happy hour too! We arrived at 5:40pm and the HH ended at 6pm. Our waitress put in a double drink order for the HH price and brought our drinks over as we finished each one. She also did the same with our food order. My mom ended up spilling some of the chipotle sauce on her white pants and our waitress took notice and ran to get some club soda. I was out of water and before I could ask for more, there she was with a fresh glass.  Love this place :)

Serene and peaceful! I have been a member for the past year. The front desk staff and the manager are always friendly and smiling. They know my first name when I walk through the door.  I appreciate that they make an attempt to know who their customers are. The facility is always clean and overall pretty quiet... the way it should be. The prices are very reasonable and offer wonderful massages. I would recommend this to anyone.

Horrible experience!  I only rated it 1 star due to the simple fact that you are required to select something. I went in for a Spa pedicure and boy was I in for a shock!  The outside of the nail salon appears to be very chabby tres chic. The staff does not speak English to you, however they speak their own language to each other which is beyond rude. As I am relaxing in a massage chair that does not work the lady is "Trimming" my well pedicured toes with nail clippers that appeared to be made for a horse. I have tiny feet and tiny toes to match. As she is trimming, she cuts the nails so short only to expose the nail bed... OUCH! Furthermore she clipped such a huge chunk she managed to also remove my skin below my nail... Double OUCH! As I sat there and bled she was very non-chalant about it. The manager came over only after a spectacle of tears was displayed and took over. Then they charged me for my pedicure. I went to the doctor and was treated to ensure I did not get an infection. Please re-consider going here... it is not worth it!

Love this quaint Oyster bar. The concept of the diner theme is so much fun. They have tables but sitting at the 50's type bar and ordering oysters with a glass of wine is a good time in itself. They have oysters by the 1/2 dozen and are decently priced. Their oysters are always fresh and are plated perfectly. Highly recommended!

This place is overall just AMAZING! The ambiance has such a FUN energy to it! The Instructors are a lot of fun and they make it so easy to follow the process. I love the Music that they play while you are painting. They provide all the paint, brushes, smocks, wine glasses, and wine openers. It is a great place to go solo or with a group. Fun for all ages :')

Wow and Wow!  What an amazing restaurant! I would highly recommend making a reservation though. The menu is built for a foodie & is perfectly executed. Their drink menu is just FUN! My taste buds were definately heaven here. Our waiter, Tim was incredible. The restaurant was packed and we felt as if we were the only ones there. This establishment has won our loyalty.

Love this place! Local and family owned.  The Fresh juice bar has a great selection and is priced just right. Their salad bar is perfect, I love the large selection of fresh produce to choose from. There are numerous dressings to choose from too! You can add a Protein to your salad of choice. They also have Hot lunch items such as the Chicken Kabob which is pretty tasty. They have only been open for a few weeks now so they're still learning the ropes; however the staff is very friendly. A must try!
