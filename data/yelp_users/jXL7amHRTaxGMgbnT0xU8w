What a wonderful afternoon.  The service was fantastic, and very helpful with the wine selection.  I now have a new favorite wine...Zweigelt by Berger.  Yummy.  And the Bruchetta, how could I forget about that.  I had the smoked salmon and Pesto and the Artichoke spread, sooooo tasty.  I have been thinking about that salmon ever since.  I would absolutely go back to Postino, and so should you.

The flavors rotate which is good and bad.  Good because it gets me out of my comfort zone, and bad because sometimes they don't have the flavor I want.  (I think cinnamon should be year round like coconut or tiramisu).  The service is wonderful and there is a flavor for everyone.  Hard to be disappointed at the Gelato Spot

Great place to see unique movies.  However i am 40 and I know that I am at a minimum 20 years younger than most of the people who frequent this theater.  They talk a lot and loudly during the films and sometimes you can hear the feedback on a hearing aid.    Even with all that, I still am a fan of the theater.

I go for Rotary on Monday afternoons.  The service we receive is FANTASTIC, however the food is marginal.  We have a set menu so I can't comment on everything, but sometimes the sushi doesn't seem completely fresh and everything else is just sort of bland.  Oh, and there always seems to be a strange smell when you walk into the restaurant.  Not sure what that is

I go at least twice a month to this farmers market and I have not been let down.  I am so happy to see more of the vendors carrying fresh eggs, they taste so much better than the store bought ones.  I plan on trying some of the grass fed beef and hopefully this week the Queen Creek Olive Oil company will be back.  I also think you should all find the Brittle man and try out his stuff.  Yummy!

I am sure there are better gyms out there, but this is where I'm at for now.

I will be back. Such an improvement over what was here before. So clean, helpful and never felt like I was bothering them.  The Charlie's nail people always made be feel unwelcome.   Chic nails is fantastic...especially Mike.
