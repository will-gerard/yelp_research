Now, I'm not an expert on thai cuisine. I'm not an expert on anything really.  But I know what I like.  In this instance, I like this place.  Wild Thaiger is located a few blocks north of the Heard Museum.  As such, it's wonderfully convenient to go here for a bite then wander down to see some American Indian history and artwork.  This was exactly what brought me there last night.  I was seated immediately upon arrival.  The server cheerily came over and, when my first beer selection was out, suggested a few options that I might also enjoy.  I like getting suggestions on food and drink from people who obviously have some knowledge and care about the subject.  I was not disappointed.  The Thai beer I had was wonderful.  Unsurprisingly, much better than the standard American swill.  Being that this was my first time here, I had to order something from the house specials section.  I decided on the Jungle Love (insert 70s funk music here).  A dish of primarily "exotic" vegetables and thin sliced wild boar in a very spicy red broth.  It was superb.  The boar, which I'd never had before, was not the core of the dish but still quite flavorful.  It added a great contrast to the mass of vegetables in the pot.  I'll be honest, I'm not sure half of what I ate in there, but it was all good.  Good, and spicy.  Not the immediate burn you get from some hot food, but the seething heat that only makes you sweat and your lips burn when you're more than half done.  It was exquisite.

The Heard Museum is much much bigger than you expect.  Well, okay, it was bigger than I expected.  Especially after watching a tour go around the native artifacts sections.  I kind of followed the tour today and after it was done (~45 minutes) I thought, "Is that all there is here?  How sad :("  Yes, I actually thought the frowny face.  Well, then I turned around and saw the gallery that went to Everything Else.  Beyond the native artifacts (which are very cool), there is a wonderful gallery of mixed media art, photography, and activities for kids.  Even the grounds themselves are wonderful to walk around.  That last part I found out because I was there 45 minutes early.  It opens at 11am on Sundays.  Ah well, it was all still worth it.

When one course of a meal is so significantly better than the rest of it, it's hard to write a balanced review.  I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesn't have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess it's supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French.  So the meal didn't start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, it's a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware I'm using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didn't notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed.  That was when they pulled out dessert.  I'm not a sweets person.  I don't know that I've ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just don't have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  I'd also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag.  I have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again.  Before I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didn't take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here.  While it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.  I can see (if I had a real life, not one that consisted solely of studying) sitting out on their patio, enjoying Phoenix, and making a dent in their wine and cheese stocks.

I really had no idea what I was getting myself into when I went to Duck and Decanter.  I'd seen the sign as I would drive south on the 51 and think "I like duck, and I REALLY like wine. This place would be perfect for me!"  As it turns out, I wasn't quite wrong, but it was not at all what I expected.  The Duck and Decanter is a strange blend of deli, gourmet food and kitchen wares store, as well as wine shop.  It all comes together in a fun and eclectic building set far back from the street and the rest of the shops in the area.  You definitely feel, as you enter the candlelit courtyard beneath an enormous old tree, that the world outside does get a little more muffled than it really should be.  Wandering bemusedly through the tiny shop behind the courtyard, I was really struck by how unique this place felt in Phoenix.  Care is obviously put into not only the choice of wares being sold here, but the quality of food presented to the customer.  When I finally got around to the deli counter, I was about to order their specialty duck sandwich when I saw they had a reuben.  As I find it hard to turn down a reuben anywhere, I asked the woman behind the counter what she advised.  Without hesitation she said, "The reuben."  Just as I had hoped and I'm glad I listened.  The sandwich was excellent.  Perfectly proportioned and fresh as possible without going backwards in time.  Making a good sandwich really is an art and the workers here are masterful as their craft.  Sitting outside at night with a wonderful sandwich in this strangely out of place shop is an opportunity not to be missed.  But take care to go there when you have some time to really savor the place.  Like the wine, there's much to enjoy here and it'd be a shame to miss any of it.

I made it to Guiseppe's only after a friend had seen it on the Food Network.  I'd heard of it before, but hadn't ever felt like making the trek out here from Glendale.  On one hand, I'm glad I did.  I've been lucky finding good Italian food places as of late.  It's also nice to know what people are fussing over with places like this, that get noticed after being on tv.  On the other hand, the overall experience I just found lacking.   Yes, I know it was on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Even though I suspect it falls into the first category, I still think it could have been better.  There was a wait.  Which only shocked me since it was an off night, so be aware of that.  Reading many of the previous reviews, I had caught that it was BYOB.  So we had run over to the Sprouts next door and grabbed a few bottles.  Surprise!  No more BYOB.  Oh well, wine never really goes to waste.  The place was cramped, and my party of 5 was squashed into a tiny corner table.  Then, what made that even more exciting, was the roving guitar player that started as we sat down.  As far as ambiance goes, he and his female vocal accompaniment left a bit to be desired.  The food was good.  If I were to rate solely on that, it's deserving of 3 stars easily.  The eggplant appetizer was thin sliced and breaded, though I would have liked more of the red sauce on it to combat the dryness of the breading.  I can't comment too well on the bruschetta appetizer, as splitting 4 different types 5 ways doesn't allow for a sizable tasting.  The bolognese I had was very tasty, and the inclusion of ox tail to it was a very very good one.  But in the end, the pretty good food couldn't save me from an overall "meh" dining experience.

After a wonderful meal over at LGO Pizzeria, my group and I wandered over the grocer that's attached to the restaurant.  I believe I may have actually been floored by just how cool and fun this little grocery shop/bakery/cafe was.  It didn't really matter that it was after 7pm and many of the baked goods were half off, they all just looked absolutely amazing.  Even my non-sweet tooth itched to try those truly seductive red velvet cupcakes or the decadent peanut butter chocolate cake.  Even the cookies looked soft, chewy, and delicious.  (Yeah, this is all coming from someone who can't walk in to most ice cream parlors as they simply smell too sugary.)  The place is charming but very tiny.  Just like the cripplingly small parking lot.  Even so, it's easy to find yourself wandering about in search of some hidden treasure, consumable or not, because you know they're there.  It's just that type of place.

The first review I read of this place said it was the "only place to eat real thai food" and after stopping in, I've very tempted to agree.  My friends and I were craving Thai after leaving the Yelp holiday party the other night.  So as this was the only place for such on the way back, we stop in.  While it's not much to look at on the outside, this tiny family-run restaurant just feels welcoming once you enter.  Well lit with sizable booths (the 4 of us didn't feel cramped) and a very friendly server/host/possibly-owner.  We all proceeded to order our various dishes.  Even though the place was a bit chilly, none of us went beyond the generic "hot" level of spice.  And when my Larb came out, I'm glad I didn't.  Yow!  I might love spicy food, but I'm gonna have to train before I can get to Thai Hot levels.  Of note, the pad Thai really seems quite good.  My brother ordered it and of all the dishes at the table I tried, that impressed me the most.  It's so easy to make pad thai bland and boring, but this had a nice gentle sweetness to it.  Not that I know exactly what "real" Thai food is, but I'll be coming back here regularly to get as close to it as I can.

After moving all the way across the country in my tiny little car, I was pretty glad to see another Goodyear Tire nearby.  I had taken my fussy car to the one back in Buffalo many times before and the service there had been excellent.  I'm pleased to report that the same can be said for Goodyear Tire here on Union Hills as well.  The service here is friendly.  Even after only a few visits (yeah, my car isn't in the best of shape) they knew me by name.  Thanks Goodyear!  As long as I've got a car that needs fixing, I'll be coming to you guys.

I will admit, my first visit here probably biased me rather severely towards this place.  I had just moved to Glendale, AZ from NY.  It had been a rough trip, it was late, and I had just finished unpacking.  I wanted food like nothing else.  So, right down the street, my brother and I come across the happily lit sign saying "3 Margaritas".  Not a chain or a place we'd ever heard of, and that was good enough.  We went in and were greeted warmly by their very friendly server.  As soon as we were settled chips, salsa, and refried beans appeared before us.  Some wonderful organic margaritas showed up soon thereafter.  The food itself was excellent.  I had one of their specials made of chorizo, which I remember being quite impressed by.  I've been back many times since, and everything I've tried has been delicious.  The service has always been excellent.  And the portions are generous, but not overwhelmingly so.  With the exception of the burrito loco.  That is one giant(and crazy) burrito.

I'm not entirely sure how anyone eats here once they've been inside.  A dirty restaurant is one of the best ways for me to get on my 'list'.  Yeah, this place is on that list.  As a non-native first year med student I just didn't have a lot of time or options so, silly me, I would go here thinking "maybe the last time was just an off day".  There were times I'd walk over and over half the tables there had food remains all over them.  Often times there was trash waiting there too.  Well, after a month or so of their off days with terrible, greasy, and just wholly unappetizing food, I decided to finally take a little extra time to bring or travel further for food.  I'm sure it's the healthier option anyway.  For a number of reasons.  I don't think, no matter how busy it gets, that I'll be stopping in there this year.

I just can't bring myself to rave about Rubios.  I know a lot of my classmates love this place, but for the life of me, I can't understand why.  It's better than Del Taco, but that's not saying much.  The food is simply entirely unremarkable.  Almost every time I've been here, the chips and beans they toss on to almost every plate have that stale 'left under a lamp too long' crunch to them.  Now, I'll offer one caveat: I've not tried their seafood tacos, and I hear they're quite good.  I'm willing to give them a try.  So at some point, I'll give this an update.

Okay, I think I may be addicted to this place.  It worries me how often I go here for lunch between classes.  But you know what, I've had the best damn turkey reuben I've ever had here.  I have a problem.  As much as I want to try other things, I just...keep...ordering....it!  That's kind of a lie.  Their breakfast sandwiches are excellent.  As is their philly cheese steak sandwich.  All in all, the prices cannot be beat, the service is friendly and lightening fast, and it's a great alternative to the terrible food at the MWU cafeteria.

I had high hopes from this place, I really did.  Sadly, my new favorite mexican place is not going to be this one.  We arrived a little after the dinner rush on Sunday and the place was packed.  We were seated almost immediately, which was kind of a surprise, considering how full it looked.  The waiter eventually ventured over and asked for our drinks.  Now, to be honest, we weren't really prepared to order yet, but after dropping off some water, we didn't see the waiter again for at least another 7-10 minutes.  Come on, we weren't ready then, but it doesn't take THAT long to figure out a drink order.  On top of that, the drinks didn't show up until the food was coming out.  Anyway, after that lovely wait for anything beyond a single glass of water, I was pretty thirsty for my drink (their take on a long island, which turned out just to be....a long island [and not a good one, at that]).  My companions food, chicken quesadillas came out looking very pretty.  My chorizo stuffed chicken medallions; far less so.  To start, my plate had other food debris on it.  Apparently wiping off the plates as you hand them out isn't a priority.  Then again, neither is quick turn around because my beans and mashed potato sides had that lovely "I've been in the window too long and got cooked" film on them. Yuck.  The chicken itself was overcooked and dry, relying too much on the breading and the oily chorizo stuffing to cover for a terminal lack of taste in the chicken.  Anyway, based on the rave reviews, I'd consider going back if someone had their heart set on it, but I don't think this is a place I'll suggest again.

This is some good pizza.  Coming from NY, I'm pretty picky with pizza. Any pizza here has to really impress me to make me come back to it.  Luna pizza has impressed me.  On top of being one of the few places I've found that has spinach as a topping (sausage and spinach is a personal favorite combo for me), they also make a wonderful buffalo chicken pizza.  Just the right amount of kick to it and the chicken is good quality too.  AND they serve it with bleu cheese, the RIGHT way to serve it.  Good stuff, and now that I live closer, likely to become my regular pizza joint.

I've learned that expectations can really effect your experience in pretty much any dining situation. Lenny's, for example, is an unassuming burger shack. It's tiny, clean, but really just unremarkable to look at. I was hungry for a burger, having had far too healthy of a breakfast and lunch. I didn't hate myself enough to go to the big "royal" burger chain across the street, so into Lenny's I went.  I forget the name of the burger I ordered. It may have been the Mexican burger, as it was topped with green chilli. That, and some onion rings, and I'm ready to go. A short wait later and there is a very pretty burger sitting in front of me. A toasted sesame bun. A hearty slab of very tasty beef. And these wondrously spicy and sweet green chilli. I was simply unprepared for a burger of this caliber to come from such a humble place. To top it all off, the onion rings were, in a word: perfect. I have never had such perfectly fried and battered rings. The onion was cut generously enough to still taste, but didn't get pulled out of it's fried shell in a single bite. Absolute heaven.   Don't judge a book by it's cover, I've been told. Nor should you judge a restaurant because it's small and tucked into a shopping plaza.   The book thing sounds better though.

The world has finally presented me with an easy choice.  After years of wandering through life, decisions half-made or made wholly wrong, a simple and easy direction has shown itself to me: I have to move to Ecuador.  Quite honestly, if the food here is representative of the native regional cuisine, I'm just going to buy a ticket, pack my cat, and head down there.  Feel free to pick over my belongings.  Almost completely hidden from view, this tiny hole in the wall of a restaurant sits, waiting for those looking to find it.  The decor is bright and charming; inviting without feeling like it's trying to be ethnic.  The tables are comfortable and huge.  I had actually thought they were a bit over sized when we first sat down but, well, then food started to arrive.  We were started with the obligatory chips and salsa.  And while they may not have been much to look at, these slightly greasy chips and sweetly spicy salsa are very tasty.  This little appetizer was soon followed by a plate of empanadas and a sampler of their tamales.  Now, I love tamales, so I was probably looking forward to this most of all.  These three (a Mexican red, a green, and an Ecuadorian) were not only beautifully crafted and presented, but they were some of the best quality I'd ever eaten.  If it's your first time here and you like tamales, don't pass that sampler up.  The red might not have been the most stunning, but the green is the perfect blend of cheese, pepper, and corn.  The Ecuadorian tamale was just unlike any tamale I've tried before.  Wrapped in a banana leaf, there was just more filling to it than I'd ever seen in your standard tamale.  The main dishes followed in good time.  Again, the presentation on this food is just stunning.  If I had ever dreamed about being a food photographer, I'd probably start my portfolio here.  The brisket I had ordered was covered in what I can only term as a "salsa" of peppers and various other vegetables.  Combined with the meat that was tender enough to cut with a fork and the avocado slices, it was just a sublime meal.  A combination of flavors that I had honestly never experienced before.  I've had (I think) real Mexican, Spanish, and a variety of other types of food.  The cuisine here is distinctly in it's own category.  I think that's what draws me back to it most: a delightfully inviting, yet wholly unknown, palate to explore.

When I saw this location had no reviews, I decided that was simply unacceptable.  The first time I went it was busy (as it has been every time since), so I went in and put my name in the queue.  The hostess was very friendly to me and said we'd be seated shortly.  I walked outside with my guest and we enjoyed some of the coffee they set out when there's a long line.  A few minutes later, the server calls out over the loudspeaker and we walk in behind a couple who had just arrived.  The man who just walked in front of us walks up to the server and says, "You just called me. I'm the guy you just called."  The hostess, bless her, says, "I think the gentleman right behind you might disagree."  I will tell you, the look on that jerk's face was nearly as delicious as the food here.  TGE specializes in exactly what you think it does.  Salad.  I mean, eggs!  Eggs!  I've been here many many times and while my cholesterol might not thank me, my palate does.  Everything I've had has been fresh and well made.  I like eggs, so I get a bit cranky when cooks overdo their omelets because they can't get them to hold together or when your over easy is over medium to over hard because, well, eggs are hard to do.  I have never had anything less than excellent here.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because their sides are such a letdown by comparison to their eggy masterpieces.  The potatoes are fine, but I've had better in greasy spoon diners back in Buffalo.  All in all, I recommend it quite highly for a late breakfast/brunch.  The weekends are busy and they don't take reservations then, so make sure you get there early.

Root canal.   The word even evokes a shudder of dread. It dredges up a very visceral response so many of us have to childhood fears of pain and scary noises. The dentist office now, as an adult, isn't much more fun. Happily, some places are at least more comfortable than others.   I've had a lot of dental work done. A whole lot, truth be told. I was pretty worried when I found out I was going to have to go in for my first root canal.  But after being in a vicodin haze for over a week, it was time to get this tooth fixed.  Happily, the folk at Copper Star Dentistry got me in to the office within a day (a conflict in my schedule, not theirs) and had me on the way to pain-free within a single visit.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Excellent dental care.

Wow.  I really had thought I'd already found the best burger in the Valley.  Then what happens?  I find myself out in the Biltmore area to study and *BAM* there's Delux.  Can I resist trying it?  No.  No I cannot.  Right when you walk in, I was struck by the 'cool' factor they have going on.  Dark paneling and blue accents, as well as an awesome long blue table in the middle.  It's not a big place, and I can see it would be easy for it to feel really cramped in there.  Luckily, the lunch crowd had dwindled, and my friend and I had enough space.  Sweet potato fries?  Done.  I was wildly amused that they came in a little shopping cart.  They are also served with side of ketchup and some some of vaguely-Cajun rémoulade.  They.  Are.  Awesome.  And then my burger came out.  I really think I heard a choir sing.  They win huge points for presentation here.  The colors they use to accent their burger are truly masterful.  It helps that the burger tastes awesome too.  And, truth be told, we went back that evening after the coffee shop gave us the boot for a post-studying drink.  We got to sit at the big blue table and enjoyed some of the many, many beers they have on tap.  It's a great place for a meal or a drink.  Now if only they had a quiet little corner I could put all my books out on...

Not too shabby.  A friend and I stopped in here as we were wandering around Vegas.  We had been in the mood for fish and it was almost like RM appeared as we said so.  The place was dead, but it was 2pm on a Tuesday, so I guess that's not too surprising.  We were seated and the specials explained to us right away.  They mentioned everything here was as fresh as possible (I filled in, "considering we're in the middle of the desert").  My friend ordered some sushi, I decided to go with their tuna melt and a beer.  I chose very well.  I posted a photo of the tuna melt which was like nothing I've ever had before.  The tuna was excellent. The cheese and bread surrounding it were also quite good.  So, why 4 stars, you ask?  Honestly, I think I lucked out.  The soup and sushi my friend ordered looked a little skimpy.  Especially for what he payed for them (Wait a minute, I think I was the one who payed. Now I feel even more cheated).  While he he said they were good, I could tell he was eying my sandwich with a little jealousy.  Well, at least I shared some of my chips with him.

Wow.  What can I say that could possibly describe how much I loved this place?  Nothing I read prepared me for how much I ended up enjoying my meal here.  I'm not sure anything could have.  Even during the dinner hour/happy hour, my friend and I were seated immediately.  We decided to have a drink with the meal, as we probably needed something to counter all the caffeine in our systems at that point.  The server recommended the pomegranate margarita.  (As a little aside here: did anyone else notice how trendy pomegranate has been over the past year or two? They're in everything!  Like cranberries.)  Trendy as it may have been, the drink itself hit the spot.  As did the basket of cinnamon-dusted sweet potato fries that followed shortly thereafter.  The cinnamon dusting was a little heavy handed, but the aioli that it is served with cuts that down quite nicely.  As my friend commented, they're very much like churros, just without the long drive to Disney.  We both ordered burgers (my friend got the vegetarian one), as apparently that's what they do best here.  After having them, I don't think I can argue it.  The burger is served on a long ciabatta roll.  The overall effect is not dissimilar to that of a hoagy (sub, bomber, grinder, whatever).  The signature burger I had was loaded with red lettuce, fried onions, feta, and pear slices.  Whoa!  It was a mouthful and I enjoyed every bite.  I could go on and on about how cool the decor was, how quick the meal came out, or how awesome they specials they have sound, but none of it would do FEZ justice.  Just go there and experience it for yourself.

Sauce is another restaurant that I really want to like more, but just can't get any enthusiasm for every time I go there.  The two star rating is perfect for this place.  It's "meh".  Always just "meh".  It's never amazing, it's never terrible.  Even this review is gonna end up being "meh" simply because there's just nothing to say about the place.  If you're looking for something to eat that costs just a bit more than it's worth and leaves you feeling just a little unsatisfied, well then, Sauce is for you.

I decided to stop in to Lisa G's after dropping my brother off at the airport the other day.  Well, 'decided' is maybe too strong a word.  Since it was rush hour, it was a choice between dinner near Sky Harbor or sitting in traffic for an hour.  I fired up the Yelp app on the iPhone and realized Lisa G's wasn't too far off.  So off I went.  Upon arrival, I already knew I was going to like this place.  The restaurant is in another one of those converted houses that are so prevalent around Phoenix.  The patio looks like a great area to sit and eat or grab a drink at.  I actually almost considered it, then I remembered I was in Phoenix and it was still over 100 degrees outside.  However, as I walked in, I did look to the window and see the Yelp reviewed signage up there.  It made me smile.  I was promptly greeted and decided to sit at the bar.  A glass of some spectacular red zinfandel soon came to my hand and I decided to assault their menu.  It's not a big menu, but everything sounded good.  On top of that, the smells wafting from the kitchen to the right of the bar did nothing to assist with my indecision.  As usual, I asked the bartender and the server what they recommended.  I was advised to try the spaghetti and meatballs, the house special.  While I waited for my food, I continued to be chatted up by the bartender, the server (Stacey), and the host (Jeff).  It all felt very comfortable and homey.  The crew seemed very comfortable together and it just made the whole experience there that much more delightful.  The food arrived steaming hot and smelling like pure meat and saucy happiness.  The chef at Lisa G's had turned spaghetti and meatballs into a true dinner.  The meatballs are apparently what the place is known for and rightfully so.  They were amazing.  When I finished basically licking the plate clean, I was almost tempted to get their "bowl of balls" because the meatballs were just that good.  The sauce was excellent as well and, by comparison, the pasta itself was a letdown.  I think it got a bit overcooked, but I'm not gonna complain too stridently, as everything else was so good.  I chatted with the staff for a while longer, learning about an upcoming wine tasting (9-10-09) and their pizza and psychic nights (Wednesday nights).  I left happy with a wonderful meal and having met some good people.  And there was no traffic on the way home.

Okay, I'll admit it: one of the reasons I love going into any type of Eastern restaurant is because I'm still fairly ignorant of the cuisine.  Sure, I'll try just about anything, but half the time, I still don't know what it even is I'm ordering.  I really enjoy that.  The reason I bring that up is that there is SO much to try on the menu at Little Saigon.  It's a pretty sizable menu, and it might not be ideal for the indecisive.  Luckily, the size of the menu did not seem to diminish the skill at which it was prepared.  The appetizers looked like something out of a gourmet food magazine.  The main dishes (at least mine) was served literally still boiling and bubbling.  It all tasted as good as it smelled.  Oh, and since I seem to be addicted to trying new things, I'll advise you on this: the salted plum tea is actually surprisingly good.  While I'm no expert on Vietnamese cuisine, I'm sure I'll find myself back here soon to keep learning.

You need to know that parking really does suck here.  Yes, it sucks that much that it's the first thing that needs to be put in the review.  Go there aware of this, and you can still have a great time.  LGO is a pretty cool place that I suspect came out of nowhere and has since flooded the little corner it sits on.  It wholly deserves the attention, mind you, as that whole tiny plaza is awesome (this does consist of a gelato shop, LGO Pizza, and LGO Grocery).  The first stop on the trip was to LGO Pizzeria.  The place was packed even late into the dinner hour.  It was a Saturday, so this wasn't really shocking.  Luckily, we were able to sit at the long communal immediately.  This also meant we go to look right at all the delicious looking pizzas coming out of the oven.  Needless to say, we felt real hungry, real fast.  Wine was chosen from the enormous tome of options (they sell wine at retail from the LGO grocery next door) and a few wings ordered.  The wings that arrived were very, very, very good.  I'm not even a huge fan of wings and these were just spectacular.  Baked and quite probably marinated for hours, they just fell right off the bone.  The pizzas, when they arrived, looked as good as everything else that had passed up by.  The Avocado pizza was an interesting blend of light cheese, avocado, and lemon zest.  While the lemon balanced the avocado out well, it wasn't quite to my taste.  The Rocket Man, on the other hand, was good and spicy.  Actually, the two pizzas were both very complementary to one another and the experience of the meal definitely benefited from it.

Once again, Phoenix, you've shown me how awesome a house can be when you remove all the furniture and put in beer taps.  The place has a wonderful lounge-y feel to it.  The separate, smaller rooms are great for giving any group a sense of intimacy, even when the place is packed and loud.  You still feel like you and your companions have this little section of the place all to yourselves.  The only problem comes from the fact that if the bar area gets packed, it can be a bit of an ordeal to get a drink.  The beer and wine selections have something to fit even the pickiest tastes.  They offer beers on tap and in bottles, which is nice (sometimes draft beer just tastes better).  They also have a great selection of bar food.  One in our group had the chili dog and it smelled like heaven.  I had the pretzel, which was warm, salty, and exactly what I craved at that point.  We also saw someone indulging in grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Even though I would have though that it was a bit warm for such fare, I couldn't help but drool a little at how good it looked.  I'll be going back here to try more of the food and drink.  It's a great place with a good vibe.  It may get crowded on the weekends, but it's worth it.

Okay, I'll readily admit my ignorance: I had no clue what a "pasty" was before I came here.  I'd honestly never even heard of them.  Never once.  So when I got out of the car and looked at the place my friend had taken me, I know that the question "what the heck is a pasty and why is there a company for them?" went through my head.  I looked at the menu (I even read the little history blurb) and still had no clue.  So, when a wee calzone-like pasty comes out, filled with the making of a Reuben sandwich, I was very intrigued.  Compared to my hunger, this thing looked puny.  But the smell, the steam, and crispiness of the pastry itself were just too good to be disappointed.  I was not at all displeased.  There is a HUGE menu of these things too!  There is a page of classic ones, signature ones, and even vegetarian ones.  The place itself is dark and cozy with a unique diner/bar charm.  Don't pass this place up.

I study a lot.  Finding places to study in Glendale isn't easy.  Paradise is the best of the "easy" options I've found around school.  They have plenty of plugs, halfway reliable wifi, and pretty good (unlimited) coffee.  Oh, and the free samples of cookies and bread are also nice when you're in the realm of $250,000 in debt.  That being said, nothing here is particularly worth it's cost.  The coffee is "generic dark" or "flavored".  I take my coffee pretty seriously, so this was the first major sin they committed upon my person.  The food is also WAY overpriced for the quality.  This place is supposed to be a bakery.  Why is the bread so dull tasting?  Why do the cookies taste like nothing more than preservative and artificial dyes?  Yeah, I'll keep going here for the coffee and a change of pace, but I'm not going to recommend it for anything beyond that.

After finding out that my tires needed to be replaced, I decided to shop around a bit for some halfway cheap tires.  My car is a bit pricey when it comes to parts.  Discount Tire ended up being the best price I found.  They even were able to fit me in before the end of the day too (even after showing up around 2).  The service was good and they were able to have my car ready when they said they would.  What more can you ask of a tire shop?

You know, as far as dry cleaners go, I gotta say these guys are pretty good. Efficient and professional. I don't think there's much more you can say about them.

I really wanted to hold off reviewing this until I had actually eaten there. However, the place is good enough that it deserves to be reviewed on it's own. Just keep in mind, I didn't eat there. But I did see the food. And I'm SO going back for the food.  I chanced into here based on a quick iPhone Yelp search for "wine". I'd actually been looking for a wine store, so it goes to show you how much I'd read. Upon arrival, my friend and I decided that even if we couldn't buy a bottle to depart with, the atmosphere was pleasant enough to stick around for. You know, for a glass of wine.  We sit at the nice dark wood bar and the bartender sweeps over. My friend was undecided on her choice and, on my suggestion, asked the bartender.  This was the best choice made that day. By anyone. Anywhere.  The somo....somma.....sumal.....wine guy asked her about her tastes and preferences (red, non-specific) and gave her a few tastes. A bit more conversation and he recommends going for the "Discovery" flight. This turns out to be a fantastic idea for her. A spectrum of red wine was put before her and she was left in a state of bliss.  The....wine guy turns to me and asks about my tastes (red zinfandels, the "real" ones, as I found out), but I'm open to trying new wines. He thinks on it for a second and mutters a few possibilities while he looks at the shelf of wine behind the bar. Inspiration strikes, and he pulls out a pinot noir. Strange, but I'll go along with it. It was the damnedest thing, but if it wasn't a pinot noir that has a lot of the earthy characters that I love in red zin.  So that was how the night went. By the time I left there, with the good-matured feeling that wine gives you, I had been thoughroughly educated in all sorts of things about wine.  I actually even found out that the winery that sells one of my favorite zins has "sold out". Sad, but always good to know.  In short: Go here now! Sit at the bar with your friend(s) and talk to the (asks Mr.Internet) sommelier! and enjoy some fantastic service and, of course, wine.

This is what real diner food is.  This sort of greasy, no frills place, is probably more true to the diners of my youth than those same old diners are today (I'm looking at you, Pano's).  Reminiscing aside, the food here is good.  It's not healthy, but that just means it's really good.  The serving sizes are big, but not the way some places give you a lot of food to make up for the fact it's not good food.  Every omelet I've had here has been filled with fresh meats, cheese, and vegetables.  The eggs alone are cooked with BUTTER and SALT like all eggs should be.  The coffee is the generic dark diner    variety and perfect for those days that you crave this type of food the most (you know the ones I mean).  Actually, the home fries are the only thing I can even think to complain about.  These are the home fries I love, shredded and fried on a flat top.  All I need to do is ask for them to be a bit crispier, and I'd be happy.  Personally, I find them a little too soft on the inside.  Am I gonna knock a star off for that?  No, they're still damn good.  Anyway, go there at least once.  You may not go there daily/weekly/etc after, but you'll be glad to know where it is when you need to find a place with coffee and greasy food.

The other reviewers aren't lying: this place is truly an easily overlooked gem in the Phoenix area.  It's certainly not much to look at on the outside, but as soon as you walk in, you can smell how good the food is going to be.  Truth be told, the head chef caught me sniffing the air when I arrived, and laughed a little when he saw the big grin split my face.  The menu is expansive.  There are pizza, sandwiches, calzones, seafood, and various pasta dishes.  I had the pasta Giovanni, a combination of sausage, chicken, and mushrooms with a tomato cream sauce.  Full and flavorful, as well as perfectly presented, I had a hard time not just devouring the whole thing.  My friend had the linguine special with sun-dried tomatoes and spinach with olive oil.  It was a far more subtle dish, but no less wonderfully composed.  The dish was not overly oiled and spinach tasted delightfully fresh, always a plus with spinach (the frozen stuff sucks).  As we started to slow a little, the chef came over with a plate of bread pudding for us to try.  Now, I'm not a desert person normally, but this was wonderful.  Far more savory that just sweet, light and fluffy.  A perfect final bite to end a wonderful meal.  It even turned out our server was one of the owners, and she told us a little bit about the place.  Throughout, she was very attentive to us and in no way overbearing.  Overall, this is a fantastic dining experience all around.  One of my best so far in Phoenix.

Mmmm. Delicious tiny burgers. Made with strange and mysterious beasts from afar. Quail, bison, alligator. All delicious and all served in smaller-bite morsels so you can try even more of them. Trust me, at this restaurant, variety really is the spice of life. Nothing I tried was bad. The quail burger was a surprising winner of the spread I went through. But even that was a hard call. Even their sloppy Joe was awesome.   And if you go, do not forget to try their chorizo and cheese topped tater tots. It. Is. Amazing. A definite do no miss.

I dropped in here after hearing Sir Terry Pratchett speak the the Glendale Council Chambers.  I was a little wary of stopping in, since I had to be back at school in about an hour.  I know brick oven pizza isn't really the quickest meal, but I wasn't hating myself quite enough to stop for fast food on the way back up north.  I'd just heard too many good things about the place to not at least give it a try.  I ordered their white pizza (the idea of fresh mozzarella was too good to pass up) almost immediately upon sitting down.  I really lucked out too, because moments after I ordered, the lunch rush began.  Well, they staff behind the line are good because even with the flood beginning, my pizza came out in what seemed to be record time!  Sadly, after all I had heard about the place, the pizza itself fell flat.  The toppings were fine, the cheese was good, but it all tasted kind of bland.  I know, I know.  White pizza, not the paragon of flavor, but it still should have had SOME presence on palate.  I wonder if my expectations for the place were too high, considering I've seen lines outside this place sometimes (it's another Diners, Drive-In, and Dives star).  While I was glad I had tried it, I still felt like this was another place that was undeservedly hyped up.  I hear that the pasta is good there too, so maybe I'll give it another try in the future.  My trust in the Food Network, however, is definitely waning.

I put forth that we need to institute a new standard of measurement to be used for comparing coffee shops.  Furthermore, I think that Cartel Coffee Labs should use this place as a standard for this new unit of measurement.  I have to assume it's called a "Coffee Lab" for a reason.  Too many coffee shops these days are retail stores, where coffee is an incidental thing in all the yelling, stupid names, and fancy colors.  If you look at the menu of Cartel Coffee Lab, there are a total of 13 items.  It's all about the coffee, plain and simple.  Then again, there's really nothing simple about it to those who take their coffee as seriously as this place does.  The artistry of their baristas is not to be trifled with.  These people can make a latte so pretty, you really won't want to drink it (until you do, then you're happy you did).  On top of that, the selection of coffee varietals is impressive.  I've only tried one, but that alone was better than anything Starbucks tries to pawn off on the masses.  Perhaps the use of the term "Lab" is because they've actually stepped beyond anything any other coffee shop has done.  Either way, the formula that they came up with works better than anything I've come across before.  Then again, maybe I'm being too hard on the other places.  It's not that they have an intrinsically inferior product, but the reason for these places has been lost behind t shirts and mugs and open mic nights and selling you a card containing the same money you'd use on the place anyway...  I digress.  Cartel Coffee Labs is a great place with a fantastic product.  If their WiFi is weak or the back corner gets dark, I honestly don't care.  Their coffee is excellent and I'll be coming back for more.

I seem to have been on a bit of an Italian kick lately.  I couldn't tell you what sparked it, but it's led to some really great discoveries as of late.  Belfiore's was one such lucky find.  It seemed a little dark when my friend and I first arrived there.  It was a Sunday night, and my heart sank a bit thinking it might be closed.  Looking in, there was nary a diner in sight, but the door to the shop connected to the restaurant was open.  We stuck our head in and were quickly greeted and told we were simply the only ones there at present.  A whole restaurant to ourselves?  Yes, please!  As soon as we were seated, one of the best dining service experiences of my life began.  Our server was perfectly attentive, charming, and there just as often as she needed to be, no more.  I think since we were the only ones there, our carafe of Chianti was filled a little more full than it might have otherwise, but I'm not one to complain.  So why only 4 stars?  The food was a mixed bag.  The salad was a small pile of iceberg lettuce, a tomato, and some radish.  Not that it needed to be fancy, but it was very underwhelming.  The mozzarella covered garlic bread, on the other hand, was surprisingly good.  There was some serious garlic love put into that bread, and we certainly left happily reeking of it.  The entree, gnocchi with Alfredo and broccoli, was strangely mixed too.  The gnocchi was overall, quite good, but the level at which it was cooked, varied too widely throughout the dish.  Too much of it was barely held together and mushy.  However, the sauce was excellent, and the broccoli was perfectly cooked, so I have to give it credit for that.  If you like Italian food, this place is another great option.  It's a bit more traditional than some other places, but by no means really fancy.  Definitely worth a visit.

After reading a few reviews and desperately searching for the One Pizza To Rule Them All here in AZ, I decided it was time to try Sauce (also, I didn't want to study any more).  I'm not sure exactly what I expected, but Sauce wasn't it.  It was good.  Not great, but decent.  The food was fresh and hot.  It tasted fine, I just wasn't really thrilled by it.  I just felt like I could have ordered a pizza from the school cafeteria and would have gotten only slightly less quality (and no wine).  Oh, and the wine servings are very tiny.  Not a way to earn fans.

So, I study at coffee shops a lot.  A whole lot.  I've gotten to the point that I feel that I'm getting a little uppity about what I expect in a caffeine shack that I'm going to be sitting, wholly immobile except for my eyes, for hours at a time.  Realistically, I can deal with blah service.  I can deal with less than amazing coffee.  I can even deal with a little bit of a mess.  But there are two things about this starbucks that absolutely drive me nuts.  First off, the place constantly looks dirty.  And I mean dirty to the point that I'd prefer to not put my book bag down because I'm worried what it might come into contact with while it's down there.  Secondly, the place has either the most powerful AC unit in AZ or it's completely possessed.  There are constant waves of hot, then cold, air that pass through this place.  You have to take your sweater on and then off again in the space of 5 minutes.  A deal breaker?  No.  Annoying as all get out?  Very much so.

Coffee Plantation is a mix of serious minuses and a few distinct pluses.  First and foremost: the coffee here SUCKS.  I was drinking it for a while to chase away a lingering hangover and once the veil of alcohol residue cleared, I realized just how awful what I was drinking tasted.  It might have actually made the hangover taste in my mouth worse!  So I got a water to rinse out my mouth and decided I should probably eat too.  So I order a cheese and egg panini.  I swear, it looked like it was squashed in a George Foreman grill and put on a dirty plate.  The pluses of the place?  Well, it's just a pretty good study location.  They have a patio if you want to study outside. They also have a nice counter to study on if you want to face the wall and avoid distractions.  A mixed bag to be sure.  Not a bad option for a change of pace, but unlikely to supplant any of my preferred study haunts.

It's hard not to write a good review of a place when you order one pizza and end up with two.  Both being about twenty times the size you thought that they would be.  Wow, that two for one special they have really rocks.  The pizza itself is definitely of higher quality than a lot of other places I've been around herein the Valley.  The cheese melted properly so that it doesn't slide off the second you bite into it.  The toppings all taste fresh, not like they were sitting in a cooler for the past week.  The pepperoni is a bit greasy but, if you're ordering pepperoni, you're not allowed to complain about that.  Give it a try.  It's good quality and you don't feel like you're harming your body by eating it.

Okay, this place is going to get a second viewing, but the first was so very good, I had to throw a review up here.  I came here for a bite to eat and a drink after wandering through the Desert Botanical Gardens.  Needless to say I was parched.  A friend tells me that the bar menu is a good deal and she was very very VERY right.  I'm sorry, a $3 halfway decent long island?  Where else do you find that?  Duck quesadillas?  Amazing.  Even their simple cheeseburger sliders were excellent.  Chuck: keep up the good work.  Keep that 100 year old cookbook of magic you brought out safe, and I'll be back as soon as possible.

This is my favorite coffee shop.  It's the best I've found out here in AZ.  It's also the only place I've found to get caffeine past 10:00 out here in the Glendale area.  Even if it wasn't though, I'd still drive the 20 minutes to it.  Not even just to study, although the tiny shop is well suited for it.  The owner is a wonderful woman and her workers have all been very well suited to the place.  The ambiance is artsy but not elitist.  What else should I mention.....I know there's something I'm forgetting.....  Oh yeah.  Coffee.  Each cup, even of their basic coffee, is individually brewed.  Dark as midnight and strong as.....things that are really strong.  It's wonderful.  The best coffee I think I've yet found in a region that doesn't seem to like strong coffees.  It's okay, I know where A Shot of Java is if I want real coffee, not some fro-fro sweet dairy beverage that once passed by someone sneezing who had drank coffee a week ago.  Really real coffee.  It's here.

I went to Old Town Scottsdale during my very first break from medical school.  I'd heard Scottsdale was a cool place, and not being a native of the area, I desperately wanted to explore somewhere outside Glendale.  I'm so glad we happened to find this place!  The building itself is unobtrusive.  Quietly sitting a block off the main drag.  It really belies the beauty of the interior.  I was really impressed by the dimly lit interior.  Even if the place was full (it wasn't when we were there) I still think the sense of intimacy at each table would be pretty well preserved.  It's kind of like how people are just automatically quieter in churches.  Then, the really impressive part began: the food!  Mexican-ish.  Fusion, it might be called.  Our incredibly friendly server, Nick, came over and regaled us about the place.  My gf and I each ordered a glass of wine from their nicely stocked wine list and some guacamole.  Turned out, we were in for a real treat.  It's made fresh.  At your table.  And it was divine.  Our entrees were equally impressive.  My pork shoulder and chorizo with white truffle potatoes was easily the best pork dish I've yet had.  When the meal was done and we finally left, it was with the throughout sense of satisfaction you get from a truly impressive dining experience.

The Tuck Shop was recommended to me by a very well-informed bartender that I met months back.  I've been slowly working my way through the list he gave me.  Thus far, everything he advised I try has been good.  Thanks Chris!  This is yet another hidden gem in Phoenix.  In this case, quite literally.  I was supposed to meet a friend here for dinner and she drove past it twice trying to find it.  Maybe it has something to do with a lack of directional ability.  I'm not one to judge.  As soon as you enter, you get the strong feeling of comfort and welcome.  I think they do a lot to make the place feel big and inviting.  We sat down to wait for a table to become free, perused the menu, and chatted happily with the other people sitting around in the lounge-type waiting area.  By the time our table became free, we were pretty much set to order.  Strange as it seemed, the wait didn't really seem bothersome.  The server gave us the whole speech that first-timers get (I guess some people still don't understand the shared-plate concept) and we were off.  We ordered a plate from each section (small, large, and starter) all to share and they timed them all well.  Nothing really overlapped too much.  It gave us time to talk and eat without feeling rushed (speed food is a pet peeve of mine, usually).  The best plate was the pulled pork sandwich, a special that is offered seasonally.  I've only recently begun to eat pork again and for this, I'm glad I did.  The meat was so smooth as to nearly melt in with the sweet and savory barbecue sauce they used.  The potato bread roll had just the right consistency of fluff and resilience to hold up the the onslaught of sauce and meat.  Mind you, we still made a mess of ourselves, but we had great time doing so.  Happily, everything leading up to that was pretty amazing too.

I constantly try to like Next. I really do. It's close to where I study. They have unlimited refills on their coffee and....  Well, it kinda ends there. The bottomless coffee is the only thing that gives them more than one star.  See, their coffee (while containing the much needed caffeine I crave) constantly is either full of grounds or oily. Either way, it usually tastes like the pots are terminally unwashed.  The food is hit or miss. I've tried a lot of what's on the menu. Most of the wraps have been left out too long and they certainly taste that way. On top of that, they halved the size of their sandwiches and wraps. Did the prices drop by half? Of course not. And it's not really like it was worth the prices they charged to begin with. However, I should temper that with the fact that their chicken quesadilla is both good AND worth what they charge for it. The meatloaf sandwich is pretty decent as well. Worth it if a $6.5 sandwich the size of a good meatball is up your alley.  Service here is just as spotty. Most of the staff are generally friendly and competent barristas. There are a few I avoid ordering mixed drinks from, but it's never too bad. My biggest annoyance is when they're playing "talkative coffee shop person" and not tending to the queue forming. Or, what vexes me more: when they play the aforementioned "talkative coffee shop person" when they wander by cleaning and I'm obviously engrossed in studying.  Sometimes with headphones on.  Oh yeah, and they're next to a college and they close at 10pm. That strikes me as a questionable business move. Then again, the 4 other coffee shops in the area do too, so I guess none of them care overmuch about tapping into the student market.

Can I give a place zero stars?  Or better yet, a negative rating?  No?  Well then I'll just write out why that might need to be introduced (at least zero stars) and I'll let you decide.  Next Coffee sucks.  The food sucks, the coffee sucks, the staff sucks (not as people, I'm sure they're all fine upstanding citizens, but generally not people I would want working at my hypothetical coffee shop).  The food consistently tastes old and stale.  The coffee continues to look more like an oil spill than anything any human should be ingesting.  If the carafes ever were cleaned, I might be able to taste something other than that film on my coffee.  The staff still seems as inattentive as they've ever been.  Much happier chatting to each other rather than actually serving the customers.  The wifi works....for PCs.  For whatever reason, Macs seem to have problems connecting to their network.  Also, they removed the student discount for orders under $10.  Here's what really annoys me though: they have ZERO impetus to improve or provide a decent product in any way, shape, or form.  Students will go there.  Students will buy their terrible food and drink their disgusting coffee.  They can take away the discount, and students will still go there because it's the easiest option.  They will continue to make money off of the customers that will flock there from the medical school next door.  Coffee and a place to study is all any medical student really needs.  Next, to be fair, provides these.  In the same way that an old banana peel and tissue paper could provide food and shelter.  They have their market cornered and can happily drop the quality of product since, no matter what, stressed and under caffeinated students will show up.  If the place showed any positive signs whatsoever, I might be willing to give them another chance.  But for now, I'm gonna go to any of the number of coffee shops in the region that provide a decent product.  The easy option is definitely not the right one in this case.

I'm starting to loose track of the number of times I've been here.  Ever since the bartender at My Florist told me about this place, I've been here with something resembling regularity.  Between the overall ambiance, the mostly comfortable seating, and the very good service, this place is a true gem in the Valley.

I found myself here staring at the menu thinking "they have whole and half omelets, what can the difference really be?"  I decided that there's no way a whole omelet anywhere could beat me.  I was very, very wrong.   The full omelet here is truly impossibly huge. I'm rarely beaten by breakfast but, wow.  The bacon and avocado that it was stuffed with was the perfect combination of flavors.  The toast was a little on the underdone and cool side, but in the face of that heap of eggs and hash browns, it kind of gets pushed aside anyway.

Once again, I found myself mildly ill and in search of food.  Specifically: food to clear out the stuffiness in my head.  While Local Breeze is quite likely good for much more, I was very appreciative of their Atomic Burger that night.  I met my brother for a bite to eat before a show at The Lost Leaf.  As soon as we walked up and saw the beautiful patio area, I knew this was going to be a winner.  The fenced in patio extends around two sides of the restaurant.  It looks spacious enough to accommodate quite an outdoor crowd very comfortably.  Inside, the place is dimly lit and feels comfortable as soon as you walk in.  The separated rooms space people out well and none of them felt cramped.  Once we were seated, our charming waitress came over and was very helpful in selecting a beer.  We ordered shortly after and the aptly named and horseradish covered Atomic Burger followed soon after.  Now, I might have more of a recollection of the taste of the burger had my sinuses not been in the process of being cauterized.  That being said, I do recall a very flavorful and well-constructed burger.  Sandwich making seems to be a fading art, but I feel confident that the cooks at Local Breeze have got it down.  The buns, which resembled hefty English muffins, were well suited to hold the sizable burger together.  As a side note: I think the bathrooms are some of the coolest I've seen.  I can't really describe it, so you'll just have to go see it for yourself.  I'm certainly going to go back once I can taste food fully again.  It had enough promise that it merits a return visit.  I only wish that it was a bit warmer and I could enjoy their wonderful patio.  I guess I'll just have to return yet again in the warmer seasons...

I feel the need to review this Starbucks because, well, when I was in there, it was without a doubt the most disgusting coffee shop I've ever seen (and I've worked for that generic 'independent' coffee shop we all know).  I've been a student for ages now and have been to many a Starbucks in my day and this is, by far, the nastiest one I've seen.  I hate to knock a place purely for how it looks, but when the tables are nasty, there's dust on the windowsills, and food debris everywhere....it doesn't seem that appetizing.  I know it may be a recession and you're suffering but seriously, clean up your act Starbucks.

This is not a burger for the faint of heart.  Or those with heartburn.  Especially not the Arizona Smashburger.  I don't quite recall where I heard about Smashburger, but I recall it sounded quite exciting at the time.  Sadly, I'm not going to be able to be nearly as enthusiastic about it.  See, while the burger is good (much better than any of your standard fast food fare), there's not much to say beyond that.  The toppings were fine, fresh and crispy, which was quite nice.  The burger was very well cooked, so I know that the staff are capable of making decent food.  They do some fun things with having different types of buns for the different burgers, but when it comes down to it, there just isn't enough to make it memorable or worth recommending.  The side dishes, on the other hand, are memorable.  Just in a bad way.  Their fries were overly rosemary-ed and too oily.  They were almost slimy somehow and I couldn't eat more than one or two.  The onion sticks were better suited as a burger topping rather than anything that should have been served next to a burger.  Don't think they're onion rings in any way.  They are most certainly not.  If you're in Tempe and looking for a burger, check out one of the other places in the area that serve burgers.  This shouldn't be the first choice for burgers in the Tempe region.

When Le Chalet first opened, I did have something akin to high hopes for the place.  It had a nice, somewhat eclectic, look.  The concept was novel, especially for what I'd seen of Glendale.  I thought it might be a hit.  Well, after a handful of visits there, I can say that my hopes are thoroughly dashed.  The worst part is that it's not even the food that's the major flaw.  Crepes are hard to make.  The fact that they are competent at it here (while also being on camera), points to a skilled kitchen staff.  The problem is that the front of the house staff is so wildly incompetent that the thought of going here makes me cringe.  The majority of the servers have been sullen and wholly uninterested in dealing with customers.  The lone light in this grumpy morass was a charming server who was on her very first day there.  I hope they don't abuse the friendliness out of her.  The coupe-de-grace for me was the last visit there when it took them at least ten minutes to run my bill.  Without a word of apology or recompense for the annoyance at having to wait long after the rest of my group had left.  It seemed like the manager who was trying to resolve this was wholly untrained in not only how to use the register system, but customer service as well.  Nope, won't be returning here any time soon.
