Love it but the wait is always long. Best pizza around if you don't mind waiting for it!

I think it's extremely import to support local businesses, so I just want to take a moment to give some love to the people who supply my pet food, Goober Pet Direct. They have an incredible selection but the best part about them is the fact that they will deliver anywhere in the valley for FREE. It's the best!! Just order your food on line or by phone (sometimes I just leave a message) and then VOILA, your food arrives at your door. Their customer service is outstanding as well. I've been with them for at least 5 years and have no plans of leaving. Give them a try! :-)

I absolutely LOVE this place.  The food is consistently amazing, high quality and fabulous tasting.  The owners genuinely CARE about the food, their staff, the clients and it shows.  Thank you for being my favorite cafe.  Keep up the awesome work.

Awesome fresh salad for the price. You can make your own or have one of their creations. Same with the sandwiches. Great service too. I will keep coming back.

This is a great place to take the kids to keep them busy and work out some of antst in their pants. We come here quite often and the kids always enjoy it. There are lots of different areas for kids of varying age groups, so everyone is sure to have a good time. We love Groupon too because they regularly have vouchers available which slashes the price in half. The couches aren't very comfortable for adults who are watching their kids, but they do have internet and a reasonable cafe for snacks and beverages. I hear they do a nice job with kid parties too. I would just recommend staying away from the dodgeball area when there are teens or man-children around who are not paying attention to the littler kids...

I was at Fired Pie today for a Chandler Chamber of Commerce event. This place is awesome. Their food is fabulous, and fast and the price is extremely reasonable. I shared the field greens salad with grilled veggies and the pesto chicken pizza. Both were wonderful. Considering they had over 50 people arrive at the same time, I was blown away at how efficient they were and how good everything came out. Keep up the awesome work!

This was the worst moving experience of my life and the company is a mess. I hired two guys and they sent me two, but one of them could not lift furniture and didn't know how to move. They told me I needed to get a third person and would need to pay for it or provide my own. So I provided my own. They then charged me for 1.25 hours of extra time which was due to their incompetence. They then DOUBLE charged me for the entire move. They were completely unresponsive to my complaints including calls and emails in an attempt to rectify the situation. They agreed to refund the duplicate charge and reimburse me for the extra hours. Paypal declined the transaction for the duplicate charge unable to verify funds and they have yet to attempt to reimburse me for the extra hours either. I will likely have to take legal action to get my money back. DO NOT USE THEM. EVER!

We really enjoyed OHSO. Awesome patio that is dog friendly. Fantastic service. Wonderful food with lots of great choices burgers, salads, and other items. And lots of great IPA beers. My favorite was the orange blossom! Another great feature is that it is completely family-friendly too. You will love this place!

We love this place. Small, quaint, comfortable. Excellent service. The food was phenomenal. The drinks were unique and tasty. Not for somebody who is on a budget but if you are celebrating an anniversary or a special occasion, go for it!
