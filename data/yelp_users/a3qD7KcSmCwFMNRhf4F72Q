Great venue.  Great shows.   I've had seats in both the lower and upper levels, and both were equally good.

We were given free admission tickets for the Science Center and for the Planetarium. Since the kiddos are home from school for the summer and it's blazing hot outside, I thought it would be a good time to use them.    Pros: nice, cold air conditioning. perfect when trying to escape the AZ heat          They validate parking in the nearby garage for a cheaper parking fee, it's about 1/2 price          bathrooms were clean and water fountains were plentiful.           Cons: the regular prices are ASTRONOMICAL!  Had I not had tickets, for me and 3 kids I'd have paid $48 for general admission and then an additional $29 for the planetarium show/movie.  There was also a special exhibit that would have been $76 additional dollars.  HOLY CRAP!  We passed on the exhibit and any additional planetarium shows (you get one for that price).  Sure, they offer a yearly membership, but if you only come once a year or less (how often do you really need to go?) that seems kind of silly (members still have to pay for the special exhibit).  PLUS, I'm a family of 5 and the family membership is for 4 people.    There isn't much for the pre-reader set to do.  They can't read the hands-on activity instructions, and what they do have is really childish (playhouse, blocks).    The employees weren't very friendly.  All of them seemed to have somewhere else they'd rather be.  The planetarium show was maybe 30 minutes and the employee talked for 20 minutes of it, not much planetary stuff..it was a cartoon basically.  SO not worth paying for, glad I didn't.    The layout of the place is confusing.  Weird hallways and rooms.  Nothing really makes sense in the layout.    I can't say we'd go back.  Way too expensive.  My kids are 5, 8 and 11 and they weren't that impressed with the place.  I sure wasn't.

I'm a big fan Sweet Tomatoes.  I like that nearly all the locations are similar in layout, so each one feels familiar.   I love bringing my kids, because they can eat whatever they want, in whatever quantity and arrangement that they want.  The seasonal specials are usually very good, and a nice change to the usual offerings.   I just went last night, and it was the first day for a California Cobb Salad and Key Lime Muffins.  Both were very good.    The staff was fast at the register and they roam the dining room to remove used plates quickly.  Nobody was refilling water glasses, which I could have sworn they've done in the past, but not a big deal at all.  There was even a guy walking around handing out fresh baked chocolate chip cookies! Bonus!  I like that there are items for everyone's tastes.  Excellent selection of premade salads and lots of options to build your own.  Several soups and pastas to choose from too.  I love getting the baked potato.   My kids are fans of the soft service ice cream.

Never thought it would be so hard to spend money in a Best Buy.  We couldn't find an employee to help us with an appliance.  It took 20 minutes to get someone to help us.

Seating area was messy, sticky.  But on a Friday night, perhaps they were busy and I just came in after a rush and they hadn't had a chance to clean. I had a large party, but the order was placed correctly and everyone was happy. I've been to other locations many times, this one was on par with the rest

I've been a loyal customer at SBE for over 10 years.  I've been a scrapbooker for a little longer than that, changing my style over the years several times.  SBE has always had what I've needed, when all the others have not.  They have a HUGE selection of everything.  I love all the Bazzill Cardstock choices.  The gals are always super nice and helpful.   They've expanded a few times since I've been going there, and it's always been for the better.   I haven't taken any of the classes they offer, but my daughter has done the kid's class a few times and had a great time.   I don't sew at all, so the fabric side of the store holds no interest to me.  It looks a fabric crafter's wonderland, so I'm sure that for those who enjoy it, SBE has what they want/need.   I love this store, and will continue going for as long as I'm able.

I've attended 2 other community colleges is this district, and While they all have good and bad points, I am most overall happy with CGCC.  The campus is nicely spread out, not too crowded not too spread out  Parking is a bit cramped at times, but that's not unusual.   I've had many wonderful teachers, and only 1 bad teacher.   I love that the library has lots of places to sit and study quitely. The WiFi is spotty around campus, but that's a first world problem, not life threatening. I'm happy here and will continue to take classes until I have no choice but to transfer to the university.

We've been coming to this office since they moved here in 2007, and saw them at the old location prior to that.   I've never been a fan of Dr Gentile himself, but his PA Steve Snesko is wonderful.  I'm sure Dr Gentile is a great person and a great Dr with many years of experience.  But he and I just don't see eye to eye on certain things.  Steve has never judged my decisions or 2nd guessed my mother's intuition.  In fact, one of my kids was constantly sick as an infant.  While another PA, a NP and Dr Gentile all ignored my concerns and wrote me off as a paranoid mother, Steve took the time to listen to what I was saying, he understood that I know my kid better than anyone else and helped diagnose her correctly.  Once we did that, problem solved!   Steve recognizes us and remembers details about my kids when we go.  He'll ask one about school or soccer.  Or he'll remember that one is a Girl Scout.  I love that he's about my age, has kids my age and gets where we are, because he's in that same place in life.   It's usually pretty easy to get in for sick/same day appointments, especially if you call first thing in the morning.  For all of the well-child visits, so long as you call about a month in advance, I've had no trouble getting in at the time we need to (birthday, milestone, etc).  A little planning on my part goes a long way.   I always recommend Steve when anyone asks.

Great place! I've never had to wait very long for a walk-in, maybe 20 mins at most.  The staff is friendly and does a great job. Prices are consistent with similar salons.  Parking can be tough in this shopping center, but that isn't the fault of the salon.

The shop was so hot! We were sweating. Our ice cream arrived half-melted. Kinda pricy for melted ice cream. Table service was slow and spotty This was our first time here, and I'm not sure we'll be back.  I thought that this place would be fun for our date night.  Not really.

Staff is always friendly.  And you can't beat the price.  My daughter has a low Rx and we have no glasses coverage on our insurance.  $39 out the door.  Can't beat that.  She's been very happy with her glasses.

My kids like that they have the chopstick helpers, most places don't.  My husband ordered the heavily advertised Carmel Chicken and was less than thrilled.   The kids meals were big in size, but it was basically all rice.  Very little of the meat and sauce.   I like it because it's fast, fresh and yummy.

Love this place!   This time we went, we went at Noon and were worried we'd run into a rush.  Nope.  We walked right up and ordered, no line.  And our food was out before we could get comfy in our seats! The food quality is always good.  And the portions are always generous, I never finish and end up taking it home.   The new Pork Sirracha lettuce wraps are AMAZING! Place is always clean, people are friendly.

Cheese soup in a bread bowl FTW! I've been a loyal Dilly's fan for years!   I've tried pretty much everything on the menu, and I can't say I've had a bad item.  The Dilly Bird is my all time fave.  On white or sourdough is best.    The portions are large, and worth every penny.

I've been coming here for years, at least 2 times per year. Sadly, the quality has been going downhill each time.   I feel like the cost is going up and what you get is getting less. They can't seem to get you in at your appointment time, ever.  I think the fastest I've ever gotten in was 20 minutes after my time.    I always ask to not use the backgrounds like the beach or the meadow.  I'm not interested in that, and who would believe that my AZ kids are on beach anyway?  They either argue with me that they have to take them or seem bothered.  If they are going to waste my time and theirs by taking pictures I'm not going to buy, fine...but why?  I like the clean look of the white background for my kids.  But the white backdrop they use is always gross and dingy from dirty feet and shoes. And it shows up in the final product.  How hard is it to keep their things clean? It's gross.    This last time I was there, the pictures turned out horrible.  The lighting and focus were off, making the subjects look orange.  I know they don't photoshop the images, but the finished prints had an "overprocessed" look to them.  When I complained, the woman said that they looked fine to her.  So I held up the picture to the actual child and said, "Does my kid look orange to you?"  She again said they looked fine.  After some debating, she reluctantly agreed to retake the photos.  I felt like she was rushing and not doing as good a job as she should have, especially since I was so unhappy with the first set.  If I'm going to drop $200 on pictures, I want them to be nice and to be happy with them.   The 2nd set were a little better, but not as good as I'd like.  The coloring was still off, the lighting was still weird and they had a weird "pixelated" look to them.  In the end, I just accepted them, although I'm not satisfied for what I paid and what I received.  But I had a deadline to meet with getting the pics done and couldn't come back another day or find somewhere else.  I'm disappointed.  The customer service was not great. They turned out a bad product, and then argued with me that they saw no problem.  What happened to making the customer happy?  I wanted a good product for what I paid, nothing more.   Will I be back?  I don't know yet.   I think they need to reevaluate their service and make sure they have proper photographers on staff.  I get the feeling they pay minimum wage to high school yearbook photographers who don't understand how to really work the SLR cameras and equipment.

I love my doctor, but the office always makes me frustrated.  I'm NEVER seen at or near my appointment time.  Appointment at 10:30am?  I get called back at 11:15am then wait some more for the doctor.   I've had this happen with all appointment times, morning and afternoon. The front desk people are usually talking amongst themselves and it takes awhile to acknowledge someone standing at the counter.   The lab people are rarely friendly.  If I didn't like the doctor so much, I'd go somewhere else.

I've been with Verizon for over 14 years, even before they went by Verizon.  I've seen some pretty excellent customer service from them in that time, and today I experienced the worst customer service from this retail location.  Last Saturday I went into the retail location to purchase a car charger.  The place was super busy.  The guy at the check in station said no problem, ran to the back, got the charger, rang me up and I was out the door in under 5 minutes.  Great. Well, turns out I don't need the charger.   So I just went in to return it. No big deal right? Wrong. The girl at the check in station said that they only do things first come first serve and I'm looking at AT LEAST AN HOUR before I can be helped.  Um, what?  An hour or more to return an item for refund?  I don't need tech help, or a new phone/plan or help with existing service or equipment.  I just want to return the charger.  If it was really a first come first served system, then they had no problem skipping me to the front of the line for me to spend money.  But they won't for a simple cash register transaction return? If that is really the system.    I am seriously dumbfounded.  I've never heard anything so absurd in my life! I called Verizon headquarters/corporate to lodge a complaint and the woman who took my call said SHE was surprised that they said that.  Said she has never heard of something so awful, and that she would be pretty upset about it too.  She was more than just a sympathetic report taker, she was dumbfounded as well.  Mind boggling.  Now I have to go back when I either have an hour to waste to get my $30 back, or get there right as they open.  Total inconvience for me.  Not a happy camper

Nope. Never going back. 10pm at night, empty waiting area, and we wait 3 hours to be seen.   The MA taking vitals has NO bedside manner for working with children.  And this place only serves children, so that's a huge turn off.  The receptionist clearly wanted to be elsewhere.  I get it, being at work is not the best, but it's part of being a grown up, so at least fake being friendly? The doctor was too fast.  I don't feel like he spent even 5 minutes with us.  I don't think he listened to our problem, I don't think he gave my child a proper exam for the complaint presented, and I don't think he was all that great with kids either.   For being a new facility, as in they just moved here, it was dirty.  Things were dusty, the floor needed a good sweeping and mopping.  The exam rooms were dingy and several lights were already burned out in the place.   I was desperate, couldn't wait until the following morning for the urgent care we usually go to, and the ER would be overkill for the issue.   But I do not recommend Good Night. At all.

I've never been seen at my appointment time, or anywhere close to it, usually an hour after.   Large selection of frames, however they are considerably more expensive than other places I've been.  I usually take my RX elsewhere to purchase glasses.  They never have my strength of contacts in stock, and the 3-5 business days that they quote for ordering them is usually more like 7-10 days.  Also, they say they'll contact you when they come in, and they don't.  They'll claim to send an email, but they don't.  I specifically asked for a phone call when they come in.  I waited for almost 2 weeks for an order of contacts, even calling a few times during the wait to check.  Told they weren't in.  Today I get a call that my contacts have been waiting for me for over a week, and that they were in fact there when I called to check.    They only thing going for this place is that they are close to my house.  The service is lacking big time.

If this place wasn't close to my house and if they didn't have the things my kids wanted/needed, I wouldn't go back. The employees are hard to locate when you need something, and are never friendly. This trip, I walked in and there was no employee in sight.  I needed a backpack, which they keep behind the register.  I stood there for over 10 minutes before anyone came up.

Big, bright store full of so many goodies you can't possibly see everything.   I love to browse when I have time to kill, and I always find something I can't live without.  This place is a necessity when your kiddo is doing a report/project on a foreign country at school.  If you need some sort of craft, item, or food from a far off land, World Market is the place to go!  My oldest did a report on Australia and we needed an authentic treat.  Finding some candy and Vegemite at World Market was just the thing!   The staff is always friendly and the store is always clean.

This was the first time I chose to have a kid's birthday party somewhere other than my own home.  I was enticed by the indoor, air conditioned play space for a hot June birthday.  Also, not having to clean my house before or after a party was a plus!  The owner was incredibly helpful and very generous! The party hosts were great with the kids and kept things moving right along.    We had an age range of 1 year to 13 years at the party and every single one of them had a great time.  Even a few of the parents got in on the fun.  2 of the dads like the boxing ring :)  The birthday girl (7) was made to feel like queen for a day and had a blast!  She enjoyed how they made her the center of attention.    We got about 2 hours worth of party time.  30 minutes in each room, there are 2, then about an hour in the party room for cake and presents.    It was refreshing to have someone else do all the work for a party, for a change!  I just showed up with the birthday kid and the cake!    When you sit down and figure what you'd spend for a party at home, especially if you do the bouncer or hired entertainer thing, this was the same if not less expense.    I was very pleased with our birthday party and experience at Bounce U.  We will return for sure!

Their 2 pairs at a low price promotion got me in the door.  But I left empty handed.  The selection of frames for that price is very small.  We walked around in the store for about 15 minutes before we were acknowledged.  The man I spoke to was very short with his answers and seemed bothered by my questions.  Don't waste your time.

Always good!  I've never had a bad experience here!  With the cost of "regular" movies going up and incomes going down, it's nice to be able to take the family out for a movie without breaking the bank.    $3 per head is a great deal.   The concession prices are also less than the bigger theaters.  The $2 kids pack with the soda and popcorn is a nice treat when I take the kids.    The only downside is that it is all cash only.  They have an ATM in the lobby though.

We went to this Krispy Kreme today, to participate in their donuts for good grades program.  They give school kids one donut per A in each major subject, like English, Math, etc., up to 6 donuts per child.  My younger daughter doesn't get letter grades yet, but the "Meets/Exceeds standards" counted.   Each of my girls got their 6 donuts, and I was about to purchase a single donut for my younger son, who didn't have a report card yet.  The woman behind the counter was very generous and gave my son a donut of his choosing for free, so that he wasn't left out.  It was very, very nice of her, and much appreciated.  My son felt very special, and was included in the fun that his sisters were having.  I would have paid for it, but the woman behind the counter wouldn't take my money.  I was impressed.  This location is very clean.  There were no dirty tables, the glass door had no fingerprints.  There were plenty of the fun paper hats for the kids to choose from.  They didn't have a water fountain, but they had a Carafe of water for those who wanted it.  That was nice too.    While the hot and ready light wasn't on at this visit, we always love to watch the donuts come down the conveyer and go for a swim in the glaze when we can.  The kids enjoy that.  AND the fresh from the glaze donuts are AMAZING!

Hard to rate this one.  The atmosphere is great.  Service is great.  Food is fresh and the place is clean.  I've eaten here twice, and each time I got very sick within a few hours.  The first time I thought it was a fluke or something else.  But after the second time, nope it's related to Sushiya.  I'm bummed, but I'll be going to the other places where I don't get sick

Lots of different things available for all skill levels. The kids love it.  Would love to see more shaded areas to sit.  Overall a great place to kill a few hours and wear out the kiddos.  Get there early to wait in line to get a chair. Or wait until lunch time and it opens up a bit as people leave.

My kids and I took advantage of the $5 special today.  We got a hayride, feeding the rescue animals at the petting zoo and some of the awesome ice cream.  It was great to check out a local business and keep the kiddies occupied for a little over an hour.  My kids were in awe of the cows and really enjoyed the time spent there.  Farmer Jason was funny on the hayride and my kids loved that. I've been thinking about doing their dairy food csa, and I think this solidified the deal for me.   Great place!

Cute shop!  they are the only store in AZ (apparently) that sells American Crafts cardstock by the sheet, and I needed to match colors to another American Crafts product, so I drove an hour from my home to go here.    Store was clean and bright.  Staff was nice, and actually remembered that I had called the day before my visit to inquire about the product in question.    The yelp check in offer had expired, but they honored it anyway, which was nice.   I glanced at a few other products, and the prices seemed to be in line with what I've seen in bigger independent craft stores.    If I lived closer, I'd go there again.

The store is crowded.  And the check out area is always crowded and understaffed.  I miss the sales and coupons.   The selections are okay.  But if you don't fit into the junior/old lady box, then it's hard to find something that will work.  The Jean selection is horrible.   The boys department is small in comparison to the girls.   Better prices can be found elsewhere.

Ordered 5 pizzas for deliver for my daughter's birthday party this last weekend.  On a busy Saturday night with a large order, I expected a wait for the delivery.  It was probably 40 minutes from submission to doorbell.   What I'd love to give a shout out for is the excellent customer service.  On the special comment line of the online line order, I asked for the driver to sing happy birthday to my daughter.  I hoped, but didn't expect they'd do it.  The delivery gal was very sweet and she did it!  my teen was properly embarrassed and loved it.  Thank you so much!

This is a place for the over 8 or 9 crowd for sure. My 4 and 7 year old were not happy.  They section it off by age, with the 7 and under crowd in one area and the 8 and over in another.  If you have siblings in the two different age groups, they can't play together, and it is hard to supervise.  The younger kids area consists of mostly inflatable bouncy type slides and climbing structures.  The trampoline area for these kids is very small, and can get crowded during busier times.  My 50lb 7 year old was bouncing on the trampoline with crawling infants, not something I was comfortable with, but that is their rule.    The area for the older kids is pretty big, lots of room for bouncing and tricks.    The price is very expensive in my opinion, and without a coupon I wouldn't have paid the $10/kid/hr to go here.    The teenagers that were working on this day looked bored and uninterested.  They were hardly supervising anything.    Seating area for parents is very small.

the worst of the self serve fro-yo places I've been to.  Over half of the yogurt machines were empty.    the topping selection was tiny compared to other places.   There was not a clean table to be found. The girl behind the counter looked bored out of her mind.    We won't be returning here.

This used to be a great clean store. But now it is a dump. Cups and lids are always empty, garbage all over the floor. Floor is sticky or wet all the time.  If something is empty you have to wait in line to tell a clerk and then wait some more to see if they will fix it.  The charter school across the street uses this store as a pick up spot, so after school hours the place is swarming with rude school age kids blocking the soors, running around in the parking lot.  There is a new store a few miles up the road, I will be going there from now on

Both my husband and I were patients at Pediatric Dental Specialists when we were kids, so it was a no brainer to us that we would choose them when our kids were big enough. They are always on time, great with the kids and up front about everything.   The entire staff is awesome.

We have had such a positive experience here!  Dr Curtis has transformed our daughter's smile in such a bold way in such a short time! She has a new found confidence and is so much happier with her appearance.   We are very grateful for the professionalism and expertise of Dr. Curtis and his staff.  We have never had a problem.  Early in treatment with braces, a wire slipped out of place on a Friday.  At 4pm no less.  Of course.  We debated calling to get her in on Monday, or to wait until Monday to call.  We decided to call at that time.  The number was directed to Dr. Curtis's cell phone and he answered.  He met us at the office, after hours on a Friday night, to fix the wire. We were impressed!  I would recommend this practice to everyone!

My family and I have been eating at Spinatos for over 20 years.  We've followed them all over town, to each location.  I would say with 100% certainty that this is the best pizza ever.  We love the family who owns and runs the restaurants.  They are great people.  We were excited to see the new Ahwatukee location open.  We were loyal to the Tempe location, but this new one is closer.  I love what they did with the old Chili's.  It is beautiful!  They really did a great job.   While my review of 5 stars is for the Company as a whole, I have to say that this new location is not my favorite and I probably won't return.   The food is amazing, that is not a problem.  I could eat Spinatos pizza and food everyday for the rest of my life.  But this location lacks the family feel that I'm used to.  On both occasions that I've gone here, I've received poor service.  The wait times for a table are grossly underestimated.  I was told 30 minutes (at an off peak time), and it was 65 minutes later that I got a table.  Our waters were never refilled and we didn't see our server until we flagged her down to get our check.    While this location is beautiful and I'm so happy for the family, I won't be back there.  I'll keep going to the "hole in the wall" Smith location in Tempe where I'll actually see some of the Family, and get the amazing food and service that I've grown to love over the last many years.

After much troubleshooting, we decided that my S3 needed a professional to fix the charging issue.  Took it to CPR.  They diagnosed it saying the charging port had come loose from the board.  Left it with them for several hours.  Picked it up and it appeared to work.  Paid $65.  Later that night, it stopped working again (it wasn't recognizing that it was attached to a charger).  The guy on the phone said he remembered my phone and that I could bring it back the next day, which I did.   On the 2nd visit in, I was told that the tech that worked on my phone was not their best tech and did not do a good job.  They said that the good tech fixed it correctly this time and I was good to go (covered under the warranty).   All was good for about a week, then it stopped working again.   3rd visit: Took it back.  They fixed it again (said they were resoldering it back to the board).  This time, they said that it was my fault it was coming off, despite my telling them it had not been dropped or mishandled in anyway (I was careful before, I was overly careful after).   Fast forward 2 weeks.  It stops working AGAIN!  This time, I took it somewhere else. They said the port itself was faulty and replaced it.  They also said the board was BADLY DAMAGED from all the soldering done by the previous shop (CPR).   So here I am, $65 to CPR, $45 to the new place, and a damaged phone from CPR's bad work.  Yes, cheaper than a new phone, but come on.  CPR could have done a better job from day one, but they did not.  They damaged my phone, now I can't get it fixed or warrantied properly from any where else.    I'm not a happy camper.   I don't recommend CPR.

The place was dead, but the dining area was a mess.  The few staff members I saw were clearly not interested in their jobs.

First impressions are really important. I try not to make a judgement too quickly, but in this case... My appointment time was 10am.  They said to check in at 9:30am since I'm a new patient.  I arrived and checked in at 9:30am.  There were 2 other people in the waiting room.   At 10:30am, I'm called back for vitals and put in an exam room.   Said exam room was in desperate need of vacuuming.  What appeared to be cracker crumbs were all over the floor.  There was a good layer of dust on the desk and the white walls were really dingy.   at 10:45am, someone comes in and introduces himself as a medical student who is helping the dr.  Med student takes my history and looks at my chart, then basically tells me that there is no problem and I'll just need to come back to keep an eye on what brought me there in the first place.  Mind you, this is a specialist and I've already been referred to them from a primary care because we've been watching and now things are concerning.   So med student leaves and says dr will be in shortly.  11:15am dr comes in.  does the history and chart business.  orders tests and affirms that things are concerning.  Sends me on my way. So i check out, and i ask the front desk girl if the imaging center that the dr has written a referral to is on my insurance.  She is seriously bothered by my question.  I explained that I don't want to leave there with the referral, call to set things up only to find that they aren't covered, then have to go back to this office for a new referral.  Then I set up my follow up appoinment.  I honestly ask if being an hour late is normal for them, and if so, I'd like an earlier appointment time so that I don't interfere with my other scheduled things.  Front desk girl again is bothered and says "fine, how's 9am?"  I don't think it's too much to ask to have an appointment be on time, especially when they insist you show up early.  I also think a dr's office should be clean.  And I also think that a dr's office should employ people that have good people skills.    I'll be finding a new specialist very soon.

I admit, I'm a sucker for pizza. I've pretty much had pizza from every place under the sun.  Lately, we've only been eating Papa Murphy's.  How can you not?  Fresh pizza, made to order for a great price.  All in the comfort of your own home.   This location is very clean and bright.  The staff is clean, professional and friendly.  It's all done right in front of you, so you don't have to worry about whether it's on the up and up or not.  There are no secrets here.  My kids like that they can watch their pizza being made right in front of them.  We usually get one of the $5 faves for the kiddos, then something more "adventurous" for us.  We love the Barbecue Chicken and the Cowboy.  We are big fans of the pan variety.   If you have a chance to have the Taco Pizza (it's seasonal), do!  It's delicious!   You can't go wrong with this one.

My husband and I finally made it in to try Porkopolis.  We are big fans of Holmberg's Morning Sickness and Brady, so we wanted to give the place a try.  We went on a Saturday about 2pm for a late-ish lunch.  The place was quiet, but there were several tables occupied.  We were greeted and seated promptly. I ordered the Brisket Sandwich and my husband ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich from the lunch menu.  He got the fries, I got the beans.   When our plates arrived, my husband's plate was half full of fries, while my beans occupied a teeny tiny little cup, like the kind you get when you ask for a side of ranch dressing.  The beans were delicious, but the portion was sadly small. The sauces on the table were delicious.  I liked the sweeter one while my husband liked the spicier one.   For the most part, I think it was worth the price.  The service was good and the sandwiches were great.  I'll get the fries next time, you get more of those than the beans.

Finally made it to try Salad and Go. I live a good distance away so I hadn't had a chance.   I was the 3rd car in line to order.  The ordering process was fast and efficient.  It took less than 5 mintues to make it to the window.   I got the special (written on a board by the menu): strawberries, blue cheese, croutons, almonds, berry vinegrette.  I added chicken since this was my lunch.    Very fast service.  The gal at the window was very friendly.    The salad itself was huge.  Very large portion.  Lots of strawberries.  Could have used some more blue cheese.  The chicken portion was kind of small, I'd l'd like to see more for the additional charge.  But overall the salad was delicious and I will be going back for sure.    The menu has lots of options, with the addition of different proteins and different dressings, the options are endless.    I heard there will be more locations soon,and I'm really looking forward to one coming closer to my home.    This is such a great option for a quick meal on the go that doesn't include fries and a soda.  This is such a great idea.     I am very happy and will return when in the area

We went here for the first time tonight.  We frequent two other fro-yo places that are in the area, but this one is closer to our home and new, so we decided to check it out.  Upon walking in, it was very clean and bright.  Lots of open space and plenty of seating.   Right away I was happy to see that they offer a very small kids cup.  This is great for me because it is easier to keep my kids portions smaller this way.  Yay!    The topping selection was smaller than a nearby place, but there was quite a bit of variety. Since Easter was this past weekend, there were several Easter candy varieties to choose from.    There was quite a backup to get to the toppings and to the registers, as there was only one girl working the register.  There are 2 registers available, and it might make better sense to have both running.    There was a sign on the front door listing all the promotions that they offer during the week.  20% off one day, BOGO another, etc.  I was happy to see this, as their regular pricing at 42 cents/oz is a bit higher than other nearby places.  Normally for my family of 5 we'd drop about $20 for a fro-yo outing.  But the smaller kids cups, combined with the Tuesday promotion of BOGO, we spent a whopping $7.  Yeah.  Mommy Likes that!  We'll go back.  Especially on a promo night to save a few bucks.

Fast service (walk-in). Lots of selection, even after the morning rush hours.  Price is a little higher than the grocery bakerys, but the product is great.

This is a hidden gem! I've never seen it as busy as others that I have been to, but they are awesome!  The are similar to the other self serve froyo places, but I like the layout better than others I have been to.  They always have new flavors, and many flavors to choose from.    The toppings bar is an island in the center of the area, which allows easy access for multiple people to use it.  Others have a buffet line type set up, which keeps the flow of traffic moving, but if you want to skip the candy and move to the fruit, you are also cutting in line.  With the island set up, you can get what you want and get out of there.  Seating is plentiful, with many spots outside too.    The quality is good and the place is always clean.

Super friendly staff! This location just opened near my home, and we are so glad!   We've been in a few times, once on a very busy football day and then on a slower weeknight.   Both times we received fast, accurate service and the wait was never long. I like that we get to watch our pizza being made right in front of us.  The directions to bake are easy to understand and follow.    The pizza is delicious.  We've had pretty much everything they have on the menu over the years.  The cinnamon dessert wheel is great too.    The prices are more than the hot and ready pizza across the way, but it is in line for the quality and variety of pizza you get.   We are Papa Murphys fans, and we'll be back again!

First, the parking lot stinks.  There are about 8 spots, and it's not easy to navigate in a full size truck.   Second, we walked in and all the tables were filthy, but empty.  The place was dead.  We stood at the counter for 10 minutes before we were acknowledged by the teenage worker.  I saw 4 other people in the back.  There was no greeting, no Welcome to Krispy Kreme.   We came on a free doughnut day, but there was no signage anywhere, so I asked the guy if they were participating.  He just said yeah.   So we got the doughnuts and checked out.  The guy didn't say anything, didn't thank us, nothing.   We sat and ate our doughnuts.  My kids wanted a cup of water, and they stood at the counter for several minutes and were not acknowledged.  So I went up and asked the same guy for 2 cups of water.  He looked around like he was lost or didn't know how.  Another guy came over and took over, but then the cups just sat on the counter.  So I asked if we were able to get them or not.  2 of the workers said something along the lines of "uh yeah in a minute".  So I said forget it and we walked out.   They were totally indifferent to us being there.  None of the workers looked me in the face, or said hello or acknowledged that I was a customer in their store.  Totally inattentive, didn't seem to care that they had customers in the store.  We had planned on buying a few dozen donuts to take home, but after this, nope, we weren't going to spend any money there.   And we won't be back.   Worst experience. I'll drive 30 extra minutes to go to the Superstition location, where they are much better.

Always clean, always fast (even when the line is crazy long!) Everyone is always friendly and helpful. My new fave drink was a suggestion from an employee.  I'm a Dutch Bros fan for life!

Burrito was good.  They could really benefit from fountain drinks though.  The 20oz only option is a turn off.  Not much seating.
