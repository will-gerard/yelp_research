I like special dining experiences for birthdays, so I chose to visit the Keg this year. We made reservations and when we got there, there was a card wishing me happy birthday with several signatures from the staff. It's a nice personal touch that starts off the night right. The service was excellent, our waiter was very personable and was always quick with a new drink or refill. The food was outstanding and well worth the price. Birthdays also deserve a dessert, so I ordered the Brownie Sunday which was delicious and way more than I could eat, so I shared it with my family. The Manager stopped by during the meal to check on the service and the food which is a nice touch, we also was the one to bring out the dessert and included a candle, wished me a happy birthday and comped the dessert. Overall our experience at The Keg was very enjoyable and I can definitely recommend it for any special occasion.

Just tried YC's for the first time and already know there will be a second and third times to come. The staff showed me how it worked and I was amazed at the selection and just how much food could fit in the large bowl. YC's is awesome!

I'm not typically a breakfast kind of guy, but occasionally I get a craving for breakfast foods. Whenever I get this craving, U.S. Egg is my go-to place. The half-and-half breakfast is the best of both worlds, you get a great egg and potato skillet plus their awesome protein pancakes.

Having moved from Scottsdale to the west valley has meant losing my favorite lunch spot, Vermont Sandwich Company. The West Coast Wrap is great, the mayo used gives it a tasty kick to go with all the other fresh crisp ingredients packed in. Even now I find any excuse I can to drive to Scottsdale during lunch for wrap from Vermont, only now I get two Arnold Palmers (one for the drive and one to go with the west coast wrap). Don't forget their cookies, most peanut butter cookies are dry and crunchy, but the ones at Vermont are so soft, creamy, and delicious (so are the peanut butter/chocolate cookies).

Wow, I've had some bad experiences at restaurants, but never anything like this. It looked it it was going to be a bad lunch when I ordered an arnold palmer and it came out and tasted like tea and water, none of the sweetness of the lemonade, luckily I was able to swap it out for a coke. We asked about the beer specials and our waiter couldn't remember, but stood there for a while trying to, but then gave up.The drunken chicken sandwich was slathered in buffalo sauce instead of the chipotle remoulade which I ordered. The chipotle mac and cheese which was described as penne, came out as spaghetti. When we asked about silverware we were directed to the jars full of knives and forks but no spoons. Storing silverware on the table is disgusting, who knows what was done to it before we sat down. We sat for a while waiting for our check before finally having to ask someone to send our waiter back with it.

The food and service were great, but the music was so loud you couldn't talk without yelling, but it was a Saturday night, I can understand that. What really got to me though was the lanes were not properly waxed so you couldn't slide and it would seem the AC was broken. My friends and I kept going outside to cool down. Several of us asked for the AC to be turned down and we were told the AC was broken, which is horrible is Phoenix. Overall I'd go to party there, but as a bowling alley, I'd go somewhere else.

The ribs were horrible, but everything else was not too bad. The pulled chicken and pulled pork were a bit bland, but not too fatty. The mashed potatoes were satisfactory and the cowboy beans were flavorless. They forgot to include the cornbread in our order, but I should have checked before leaving, so my fault.  The biggest disappointment were the ribs. They were so fatty, almost no sauce, and what little meat you could find tasted sour. I'd recommend staying away from the ribs, but their taquitos were pretty good.

I've been working on losing weight and building muscle for almost a year, working out at big box gyms but Underground Fitness is really the first time I've enjoyed working out. The trainers are incredibly personable. They'll joke and chat as you're stretching and cheer you on when you're in the middle of a squat or plank. The workouts never get boring and change from camp to camp which keeps it interesting. I had a friend recommend Underground Fitness to me and now it's my turn. Great workouts with an awesome staff at an affordable price makes Underground Fitness easy to recommend.
