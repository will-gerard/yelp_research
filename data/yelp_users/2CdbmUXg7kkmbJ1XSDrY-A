Orange Table has a great ambiance and location. The menu is interesting and well thought out.  That being said, I have no plans on coming back.   I've been coming here off and on for a couple years. Each time gets more and more disappointing. This particular time we arrived at 9:30 or so on a Saturday, just before the big breakfast rush. A good chunk of the tables were occupied, however there were a few available, probably about half full. The two of us gave our name and were seated in the waiting area.  As we sat, we noticed a gentleman, chilling out behind the counter, texting in plain view, generally looking lazy and slow.   About 10 minutes later, we were seated. Turns out Lazy McTexter was our server. He seats us, doesn't ask us what we would like to drink (we'd been waiting, we knew), and disappears for another 10 minutes. He comes back, I decide against coffee (theirs is delicious usually) and went with OJ. Big mistake. I understand fresh squeezed OJ has pulp, but this was ridiculous. I literally had to chew it. We ordered the food then too, no telling how long before he'd be back.  Food came about 15 minutes after ordering. Not forever, but a little long for a breakfast menu. I ordered the eggs benedict, and my friend ordered chocolate chip pancakes. I know they're famous for the hash, but we've had it before.  Here's the worst part about the whole situation, the food was good! The eggs benedict were some of the best I've had in the valley! The hollandaise was creamy with just a hint of citrus tart. Eggs were poached well, ham was good.   The pancakes were a little dry however. Not to worry, when you have dry pancakes and don't give a damn about calories, you just put a little extra syrup on it, right? We wave down our server (literally waved my hand in the air to get him), ask for the extra syrup, and he mutters that it will be extra. A little ridiculous to charge extra for a cup of syrup, if you ask me, but whatever, it can't be more than 50 cents right?  Wrongo, pal. $2.00! Two George Washingtons for a shot of maple syrup. Seriously?! I don't care how good it is, syrup ain't $2.00.   That was the kicker. To have service that terrible (note the other reviews) and then nickel-and-dime the customer like that is unacceptable. I worked in restaurants for the majority of my teens and 20's (everything from prep cook to bartender), and I think I have reasonable expectations when it comes to quality of service. Orange Table doesn't cut it. Adios.

Here's the deal. I said I was done with OT, but a friend told me the management had changed and it was worth another shot.   My friend was right.  Everything I had a problem with before was remedied. I went in unannounced, didn't tell anyone about a previous bad experience, and I was given some of the best service I've received in town. When we went in, we were sat quickly and tended to very well for our entire visit.  No texting employees, no indifferent waitstaff. The chef was in the food window expediting food, making sure it went out promptly and correctly. Not only was our server attentive, but there was a team service atmosphere and other servers came by our table when we had empty drinks, debris on the table, etc.   The decor has been refreshed, and although I didn't dislike the decor originally, it is definitely an upgrade as well. Now its much cleaner, but still maintains the character that was part of its charm before.   Props to the new management. Well done. I'll be back.  PS - forgot to order side syrup. Curious to see if they still charge $2.

I went to Wildflower looking for a lunch spot that had wifi. I arrived at 11:30, and noticed every table in the small place was full. It was my first time there, it seemed a lot like Paradise Bakery (which is a good thing), so I ordered, hoping a table would open up. Price was about the same as Paradise. By the time my food got there, no tables opened, so I got the food to go. I got home, opened the food, and much to my dismay, it was quite a bit worse than Paradise. Also, no delicious cookie. Next time I'll just drive up the street a couple miles.

Bogeys is awesome sauce.   I'm usually here twice a week or so, and its the definition of what a local neighborhood bar should be.   The food is exceptional, especially for the price. I can't count how many OC or Chipotle chicken sandwiches I've had. I can't remember ever being disappointed with any menu item, and the Tuesday $1 tacos are fantastic.   They have tons of TVs and the staff is super friendly. The patio is big, and the bartenders are friendly and helpful.  If there could be any complaints, I'd say the servers sometimes get overwhelmed and can be slow. They're cute and fun though, so I won't take a star away for it.  Like I said at the beginning, for a neighborhood bar, you can't ask for more.

Love this place. Love it.   As with most places in the Raintree/FLW area, during lunchtime it gets superduper busy. They have a good layout, and a TON of seating, so this location doesn't get too bad. They always have a friendly greeter handing out cookie bits while you wait in line, and the line moves quick. The menu is well laid out (better than other Paradise locations) and the food is top notch.  Their side (overflow) room is great for seating a group of people, and they have a tv in there too (unusual for Paradise). Couldn't be better. Plus they have free wifi. Bring the laptop and stay a while.  Only complaint is that its a tiny bit pricy, but considering what you get, its worth it. Half salad, half sandwich, drink and a cookie (best part) is around $10.

The old bait and switch! Was promised by Anthony an escalade style limo for our wedding (enough space for our bridal party and photographer/videographer). He even texted me a picture of the limo. What showed up was an old piece of garbage, From the 90s at the earliest, possibly the 80s, that barely fit our wedding party. So because of their deceptive practices, we missed out on our limo pictures.   In addition, the driver was concerned he'd be late for his prom pick up (our wedding was May 7) so he drove way too fast from our ceremony to the reception. Another phone number they use is (858) 699-0115. Do not use this company under any circumstances.

Phenomenal meal. When we arrived we were promptly greeted and seated. Although the wine by the glass choices were limited, there were decent options that matched the menu. The service looked a little backed up, and our first drink took quite a bit longer than expected, which brings the fifth star down.   My date and I started with the lamb manti, which was incredible. It was a dish of little pastries filled with lamb, served with pomegranate and middle eastern yogurt and cheese. It was a dish I had never eaten before and is something I'm excited to try again, the best dish of the night.   We also had the pasta, spaghetti squash and lamb chops, all of which were excellent. I doubt there is a bad dish on the menu. Definitely go if you have a chance, this is definitely one of the best spots in the valley.

My date and I had a dinner reservation on Saturday at 9 at FnB so we decided to get a drink before at R+D, right across the street. I understand this isn't a place that you just pop in and out of so we got to the dumpster and called at 7:45. One group of 4 was in front of us, and we were told 20 minutes to wait. That was expected, so we hung out and waited. The foursome was let in about 20 minutes after we arrived, and we anticipated we should get in shortly. After a 45 minute wait we decided to go across the street to make sure we got to have a drink somewhere before our meal. Would have loved to try it, sounds fun, but the wait was absolutely ridiculous.

This is THE BEST spot in Biltmore/Arcadia to bring your laptop, grab a coffee, and get work done.   Great coffee and breakfast food, with tons of nice heavy wood tables and chairs. I've never come here and not found a comfortable place to sit. Plus you've got that cool Henry decor. Can't recommend it more.
