Eclairs to die for! The word foodgasm does not even begin to describe the feeling I got with the first bite! i just want to drown in the filling!   Also- the II Purist is delish.   Every time I go I give their herb infused olive oils the googly eyes but never end up taking it home. lol I will one day!

The 411:  -tiny place with live music on the Friday night we went -long wait (45min for a party of 2 on a friday night) but worth it -absolutely love the pom guac- ridiculously delicious (my fav) -legit tacos   Would definitely go back even with the long wait- next time I will order drinks at the bar while I wait

Came here to grab dinner with Cali friends before they head back home. I ordered their hot pot sweet and tangy soup with catfish. It was a perfect marriage of sweetness & tangy-ness with tomatoes, okra, celery, pineapple, bean sprouts, and herbs/spices. My bf and gf got pho. They said it was pretty good. Another friend got vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and egg rolls. He ate all of it with a smile on his face so I'm assuming it was good. Lol. I also ordered the Che ba mau (3 flavors dessert drink) and that was good too. The service was awesome as well.  Would definitely come back again.

Absolutely love this place!  We sat at the bar since there was an event going on and we didn't have reservations. The bartenders are awesome (STEVE!) The apple crown royal concoction Steve made me was good, as well as the Jamaican Mai Tai, but the guava mojito was so-so (not enough liquor lol) I ordered the seafood Chile Relleno with maple glazed carrots and jalape√±o cream corn. All of it was delicious but I think the crust of the chile relleno was too thick and too much so I just ate the inside lol. The boyfriend got enchiladas with green beans and chipotle mash as the sides and it was all yummy!  A couple got engaged next to us which was cool.  Oh we also ordered the chocolate Torte which was decent.   We used out Living social deal ($10 for $30 can be used any day for dinner between the times of 5-9pm for a party of 2 or more buying 2 entrees, Groupon is $13 for $30 ) which helped with our hefty bill!  Our overall experience there was great!  P.S. The patio is beautiful and a bit romantic with the hanging lights all over

I would say this place was a 3.5 but I'll round up to a 4 I guess.  I always like to get Sunday brunch at a place that has a decent patio whenever possible so I can bring my fur baby along.  You line up, order and find a seat. I got the Brizza which is breakfast pizza. It's just what you think it is. A pizza with breakfast foods on it- hollandaise sauce instead of tomato sauce, with eggs, sausage and cheese.   It was good but a bit heavy of a meal for me since I usually like to eat something light in the mornings.  I will probably share this next time and get a side salad or fruit on the side.

What I Loved: -dog friendly patio -good brew of coffee and Americano  -free coffee refills when you check in (a bug flew in my Americano while I was chilling' in the patio before I could finish it so they were kind enough to make me a new one for free with my yelp check-in SO AWESOME) -Super friendly staff -Yummy New Yorker Quiche -Delish Scramble plate   It's my new go to coffee spot which I can bring my fur baby to and grab a light snack as well!

Best Eggs Benedict that I have ever tried!  The winners are: Chile Verde and Chilaquiles Benedicts!  They have majorly cute Winnie the Pooh look alike tiny honey pots of espresso! Good!  Super cute atmosphere. Great service. A bit of a wait to get seated but its ok cause I just went down the plaza to Nordstrom rack to shop while I waited. They text/call you when you're table is ready.

This truck was at the Glendale Glitter and was one of the more appealing options besides the fry bread, lobster mac and turkey leg there when making our rounds to see what we should try to stuff our faces with. The bf and I ordered burgers and got the free fries for checking in. He got the cali burger and I got their aioli burger. The garlic aioli we asked for on the side for the fries was yum. My burger was a bit dry and bland for me. I ordered medium for the patty but it was dry so I know it was well done. Couldn't taste the aioli in my burger either. Could have used some pickles or something for a kick in your mouth factor. I don't know. This place had a lot of potential to be really good and I really wanted to like it because who doesn't like aioili  but sorry guys- you failed miserably at it in my case.   p.s.  there was a hair in my fries too :(

Really clean more modern looking place which is always a plus. They have pan dulce, flans, ice creams by the scoop as well as paletas and mangoneadas in addition to their regular menu items which consist of taco plates, burritos, tortas, soups of the day, nachos to name a few. I ordered the short rib tacos, pazole, cucumber agua fresca and a guava paleta. What I liked was that I can chose how well done I wanted the short ribs to be cooked! Medium please! Thanks! Everything was absolutely delicious! There's a tiny salsa bar. I really like the pickled onions from the bar and the fried yellow chile that came with our taco plate! I didn't even get a chance to take pictures cause I wanted to devour it fast! I really liked that there was a patio too with an umbrella for shade. Gonna go back for sure!
