BUYER BEWARE:  They will take your credit card and have you sign a piece of paper for opening a tab.  Problem is they always put charges you didn't authorize on the card.  Just recently I went and had bought a round of drinks, myself and two other people.  The bartender said it was $12.00 and thats all I got for the evening.  Once I looked at my credit card statement they had actually charged me $40.00 instead of the mere $12.00.  This isn't the first time this has happened, there are three other occasions that are being investigated by my credit card company since this appears to be the way they do business.  Be wary of opening a tab here or you might end up paying more than you actually should.

WOW, that's the best way to describe this experience.  I haven't been in a while because of the prolonged delay and poor quality of food delivered last time.  But tonight, not only was the Nigiri downright amazing but so also was the Miso Soup and Seared Tuna.  In addition, I believe its more than worth pointing out that I was BEYOND impressed by Isaac at the bar tonight.  He exhibited some of the most profound and professional customer service abilities I have ever experienced in a restaurant.  He was very polite, extremely attentive and above all else, truly exhibited that he cared.  I plan to come back much more often after this experience.  Thank you Isaac for a great experience and thank you Ra Sushi for a great meal.

Garrison is an absolute gentlemen and a very kind host.  Him and his staff are friendly, polite and very accommodating.  Last few times I've been there, Colton has been my server; words can't describe how incredibly exquisite his skills are as a very impressive server.  Not only does he bring a bright smile but also friendly and very superb personality with top-notch service that words simply cannot describe.  I highly recommend stopping by; let Colton suggest his favorite drink and appetizers, he always gets it just right.

Typically I don't write bad reviews but the last time I went to this restaurant, during happy hour on a Friday they royally overcharged me for my appetizers and drinks.  I didn't pay much attention at first but then did a more thorough review of my receipt and was appalled by what I found.  Upon speaking the restaurant they didn't care.  Considering it was happy hour prices and I walked out spending over $60; let's just say I won't be back or recommending this place to anyone.  I would also encourage anyone who reads this to stay away, you are likely to face the same issues with their creative billing that I did.

Not impressed.  Went a few weeks ago and sat for over 20 minutes with NO service or even someone to order my drinks.  Not to mention, they appeared annoyed when me and my partner went in and didn't have a reservation.  The overall treatment made me feel less than welcome, little did they know I was prepared to indulge myself with a great deal of seafood and drinks.  Too bad for them, we ended up leaving after we had literally no attention at all from anyone.  For those prices, they should be worshipping you as a customer from start to finish.  Couldn't even get a reasonable "hello" from anyone.  My suggestion, stay away.  Donovan's on camelback is a much better option.  Go there, they will treat you like royalty instead of trash.

Hit or miss at best.  Last night when I called a male answered the phone and was anything but willing to take my order.  They have delivered to my area several times before but not last night, all sorts of creative excuses came up.    THE RUDE EMPLOYEE FROM LAST NIGHT SHOULD BE FIRED!    Not sure WHO the manager is, but if your employees are making business decisions for you, thats not the kind of place I am going to engage with any further.  Guess what, you just lost a customer who was ordering weekly and giving a generous tip to your driver each time.    My recommendation to everyone, STAY AWAY!!!

One of my favoriate places to have Sunday brunch with friends.  The staff is very accomodating, extremely friendly and really on top of making sure you have everything you need.  I never have to ask for more water and always get hot, delicious food served in a reasonable time frame.  I have tried most things on the menu and ALL of them are amazing.  Highly recommend, especially if you like Mojitos...

Let me start with the good parts:  Nanci from the pool was great, some of the best service I have EVER gotten.  Lindsay from the restaurant was awesome.  Even though I spilled my champagne Lindsay still, with a smile got me another one faster than the first.  The bellman Mike was awesome and accommodating.  Everything we needed he got within an instant.    Here is why it's unlikely I will ever be back:  The hotel had a lavish perception but cheap approach.  They claim to be "pet friendly" but watch out, if your dog barks because of insanely out of control noise in the hallway between other rooms then you're going to get multiple calls at breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Not only that, they actually told me to come back to my room and try to calm them down.  Fine, we did this a few times.  The first time they were barking was because of housekeeping going up and down the hallway with those noisy carts that sound like a tornados approaching.    The next few times I got a call was because of the bigots between rooms on each side of mine making noise in the hallway as they left the doors to two different rooms wide open.  They were screaming, laughing, joking and cussing like a bunch of high school kids.  Naturally my dogs would react to this level of noise by barking.  I call them bigots because we heard and saw the rhetoric when me and my friends were all hanging in the cabana most of the day, they were making comments, and some of them even stopped everything, turned towards my cabana and just looked like they have never seen two men give each other the slightest bit of affection ever.  Later that night I'm getting calls at dinner because of a "noise complaint" from the dogs.  They didn't even BOTHER to go to my room to see on each side of the room was the real noise CAUSING them to bark.     My disappointment is stemmed from the blatant disregard this hotel had in investigating the matter before calling me multiple times, interrupting my meals and really putting a damper on my ability to enjoy this place.  I won't be back since it emanates bigotry and that seems to be why the "complaints" about my dogs even started.  If someone has a problem with our lifestyle well that's just too bad.  If the hotel won't do more to promote tolerance and diversity, then guess what, this is the kind of irrefutable madness people can and will do to kill a good time.    Hotel Valley Ho is on my blacklist and it would really take a lot of convincing to even re-consider it again in the future.

I had a great experience here.  The doctors are friendly, they don't try to gouge you for money or make up work that doesn't need to be done (unlike a previous dental office, Bright Now Dental, stay clear of them).  They have very clean offices and really up-to-date techniques.  I highly recommend this dentist!

I'm very disappointed for the first time with Switch.  The lettuce wraps were loaded with cabbage and very little chicken.  The feta cheese, tomato and cucumber salad wasn't all that great either.  Sorry Switch, not happy with tonight's food outcome.

IN LOVE WITH THEIR KING CRAB LEGS!!!  Best I have EVER had in my entire life.  Food is UNBELIEVABLE, bread is so hot and fresh, and service is unlike anywhere else in town.  It's a bit pricy, but you get everything you're looking for and THEN SOME!!  Steak and lobster go good together, try the duckets bucket for starters and then dive into the crab legs or lobster.. You won't be disappointed!!!

I'm amazed at the inappropriate email this company sent me.  First Michael suggests that I go to "home depot" and find labor but even worse brags that hes basically the most talented handyman in the entire city.  Here is the lovely response he gave me:    "First off you don't start a business proposition with theses are my "non-negotiable terms".  If you think a business that has been around for 11 years and can do everything that a contractor can do will sit and agree to your ridiculous "terms", then you have been smoking something. Either your some cheap slum lord or you have been dealing with guys that do second rate work. I get my $55/hr AND I'm booked solid.   When your business gets to the level my business is, then you can come talk to me about worth. Oh, wait you work for Ask Me. Great springboard job you got there. GO back to your delusional landlord of South Phoenix life and be sure to get what you pay for, right, you will."    No liability insurance, no certification or contractor license and he thinks $55 an hour is appropriate?  There must be a lot of clueless people out here.    This company has proven to be RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL and ABSURD!  STAY AWAY.

Ron is super friendly and very professional!  I contacted him this morning and he was able to make it over within just a few hours.  The issues that were presented to him got resolved quickly and for a very fair price.  I highly recommend Rooter & Plumbing Service!!!  Thank you again Ron!!

Wow! That's the best way to describe this experience.  And yes, it was one very enjoyable experience.  The friendly (also cute) waiter along with the really polite staff and really just world class service completely impressed me in so many ways.  The food was amazing, drinks perfect and environment very comfortable.  Want a great place for weekend brunch? Believe me, this is it.  Check it out, I promise you will not be disappointed in any way at all.  They really know how to make you feel like a very important person from start till finish.

Stay clear, the doctors argue with the staff in front of patients, they claimed I had multiple cavities and after a second opinion found out I had none.  The billing tactics are questionable and they are fairly rude in general.  This gets an epic fail rating and I don't recommend them for anything.

Just Ask Meghan is a vital part of my weekly success.  They provide dog walking services for me and have been nothing less than AMAZING!  Cindy is great, friendly, always following up and making sure on a weekly basis that my needs are fulfilled in every possible way.  I highly recommend Just Ask Meghan as they are highly competent, integrity driven and very trustworthy!

Cindy continues to be a lifesaver at every corner.  Every week she comes over and helps me out, even if it sometimes is a last minute request.  I am glad and very excited to have Just Ask Meghan to help me out every week.
