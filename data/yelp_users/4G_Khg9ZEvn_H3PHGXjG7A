Came in for a sandwich and found myself getting an AMAZING toasted italian sub with a side salad. Absolutely outstanding.  The person at the counter was friendly and informative, and helped with suggestions. They have an amazing menu of Italian cuisine, and they also have frozen, fresh and Italian product market items you can purchase to take home. I truly recommend them if you are around Shea and Scottsdale road for a great lunch or dinner!

TALK ABOUT HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!  I called about printing a particular type of design, a table tent, and SHANE'S response was so condensending and rude. He said, well is it on paper? Then I guess we can. He could have said, yes we do sir, absolutely! Can I help you get started? NOPE. WHAT A JERK. I work for a company that does a lot of print designs for multiple properties, and now I know that I need to go to another source. Customer service is key, and it starts at your first interaction with the customer. You have lost it and I will do everything I can to tell others not to got to your store. Other places may have a higher price, however it is worth it to not work with that quality of service!

I have been going to Roberto's for over 10 years. First off, the service is fantastic. I am always greeted, and even if it is super busy, they have time to smile and make you feel  at home. I am a creature of habit, so I always like to get my normal meals; bean and cheese burrito, or the taco and cheese enchilada combo. Sometimes, I will ask for a recommendation, and they hook me up with something new!   Out here in Phoenix, Mexican food restaurants are a dime a dozen, however for the quality, and for the service and atmosphere, my family and I will go to Roberto's as long as they are here. Keep up the great work guys!

So... It is really good, I would not say it is JUST LIKE NY pizza, however it is good. Guy at the counter was nice and was greeted at the door. A little customer service goes a long way. :)

I loved my experience at Cabin Coffee! Great atmosphere, and wonderful service. I had the green shake, which was recommended by one of the staff members,  and it was very well made and was also affordable. I can't wait to head back!!!

I love coming to The Place for breakfast. Even when it is busy, you really don't wait that long. I love the bacon here, I mean, I love bacon from most places, however they know how to make that bacon sing! The only issue I would have is that sometimes the tables, depending on how many you have can be a little cramped, that same feeling you get sitting in a chair in a kindergarten classroom, however that has only happened a couple times.

There are breakfast places in the valley, then there is Over Easy. It is a cozy atmosphere, and the service is always very good. I really love most everything they have on their menu, however their corn beef and hash is so good! I have taken many with me to enjoy breakfast, and looking forward to future visits!

I go to visit Mary Beth every two weeks at Salon Faith. Once for the haircut, and then they offer a complimentary trim in between to keep you looking clean! Everyone that works there is courteous, friendly and fun. You don't hear negative talk, gossip, or anything negative, however you get an atmosphere that is comfortable, clean and cozy. Mary Beth is an amazing stylist, and her passion as a stylist comes out every time I visit her.  I recommend Salon Faith to ANYONE. As a side note; When you come to your appointment, make sure you come a little early for parking.  It can get busy with all the salons and businesses around, so make sure to come a few minutes early just in case.

The green corn tamale was hard, cheese enchilada was OK. Rice was good and beans standard. What gave it 2 stars is the service. A kid at Taco Bell is friendlier. I sat at the bar and I think the bartender talked to me once, and it was to see if I wanted anything else. UM... NO! Service makes everything. It can make so so food better... This service made the bad food stand out more. I will be going to El Encanto Dos instead. It is out of the way but it is better service and much better food.

Well, I so badly wanted this place to be incredible. It was OK. Service was, eh... And the food, well lack luster. I had the 2 combo meal with the ribs and brisket. Brisket was OK, however the ribs were overcooked and salty. I had Mac and cheese and potatoes. They were both bland. I felt so awaful after my meal, as well as my friend that went with me. I actually got sick, which I never do. Sorry folks, but not going there again. :(

I am very happy that I found Designer Body Fitness. I have seen lots of different trainers, done many different work out programs, and Christina does an amazing job of taking out the cookie-cutter workouts and making sure that the work outs that you do are challenging as well as designed to fit your needs. I have had many issues with my knees in the past few years, and she has really helped me to rehabilitate them and get them stronger!  Christina is also a very caring and inspirational personal trainer. She just doesn't say things to get you motivated... she lives it. If you are looking for a personal trainer and nutrition coach in Phoenix, definitely check out Designer Body fitness.

Notorious Kitchen is a great place for lunch or dinner!  I came in to check out the burgers and I was not disappointed.  I got the Notorious BIG burger and it was perfect.  Even the sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty!!!  I love the comfortable atmosphere and the service was really good.  Thanks folks,  I will most definitely be back!!!

It use to be good, however now it is overpriced and not good. I live literally across the street and when I got my food home it was cold. The Carne Asada in my burrito was cold and even the cheese in the enchiladas wasn't even melted! Staff was very unfriendly and I paid $20 for two combo meals.  I would rather go to Taco Bell at this point. Good thing we live in Phoenix where there is more choices.  Quite a shame.

There is so much I can say about U & Improved, however I will sum it up in just a few words. Jodi Low and the entire team at U & Improved are passionate about helping people see their potential as leaders, communicators and warriors in life. To train anyone to be great leaders at work, at home, and anywhere life takes them. The trainers are some of the best trainers you will encounter. Dean, Gina and Geno were my coaches, and I owe them so much for their dedication to the program, to the participants, and to me. Do yourself a favor, and experience U & Improved. Once you are there, you will have not only friends, you will have fellow leaders to encourage you and celebrate with you for years to come. Well done U & Improved... well done.

Great Service and Great People!  I was looking for a new dentist, and had not been in to get a cleaning. I noticed their office, and being so close to me, I decided to give them a shot. I am glad I did. Not only am I happy with how they treated me, they were fun, relaxing and extremely knowledgeable.  The dentist, Anthony Miaoulis is one of the nicest and most understanding dentists I have ever met. If you are a little nervous about dental work, come see this team. I would most definitely recommend them, and look forward to working with them for my dental health!

This is he best new America -style food restaurant I have visited in a long time!!!!! All the food was great, however the Taco pizza was THE BEST!!! The best part is the atmosphere... They want to honor anyone who was a hero in your life by sharing stories, putting photos on their wall... Amazing. My new favorite place.
