I love this place. I go in weekly to get fresh loose flowers for around the house. The staff here are prompt and very helpful. They have by far the best quality around and on Fridays they are half off! Definitely recommend this place!

Called them on the phone before going in for my service and the girl on the phone neglected to tell me about the summer hours. Got all the way there and she said "oh yeah we close early for summer" ...... Really? So unprofessional. Maybe they should update their website and communicate better with clients. Won't be returning here again!
