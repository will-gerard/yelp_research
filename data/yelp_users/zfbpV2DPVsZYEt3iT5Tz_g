The food was good, but a little overcooked. Nothing was inedible though. I had the California Benedict. It was definitely tasty. My husband had the corned beef hash and enjoyed it. I also had a Bloody Mary and it was really good. It had a pickle and olive which I like way better than when it has celery. That's just my personal opinion though. The service was fast too. It was around $30 for the two of us. Not bad at all.

Let me just tell you about the horrendous experience we had buying a truck here. My husband had been looking online at the inventory and had picked out a truck he liked, contacted a salesman, and set up an appointment to buy it. First of all, this dealership is over an hour away from our house, the Mesa location would have been much closer. I'm not really sure how he ended up talking to someone at this location. It turns out the truck had recently been moved to the Mesa lot, and I encouraged my husband to just go there. He felt bad because he'd already been doing business with someone from the Bell location and felt bad denying him the commission. Whatever, obviously that part was our fault. They move the truck to the Bell store, and we go there. We have two kids, so I tried to carseats in the truck to make sure everything works, then have to reinstall them back in our car. Again, whatever it's part of the car buying experience. We spent over two hours getting all the paperwork done, in the meantime our toddler is going crazy because she's bored and wants to run. In the end, we sign the papers and take our truck home. Yay! But wait, a week later, we get a text from the salesman letting us know that the truck we're actively driving out of town, isn't actually our truck. Apparently, due to our credit, we can only buy a truck that fits certain parameters, which this one doesn't. Sounds like something the dealership should be aware of doesn't it? So we have to once again make the hour plus drive, take the carseats out, reinstall them in a new truck, and sit around for over two hours (with the aforementioned crazy toddler) for the paperwork to be ready. They'd actually assured us that the paperwork would be ready when we got there since they already had all our info. Plus they tried to get us to put a larger down payment on this new truck. No way were we giving them any more money, we told them to either make it work or give us our money back so we could go elsewhere. Finally, we take home our new truck. It's newer, it's nicer, so after a while I start to feel like it worked out in the end. Then yesterday, my husband gets a phone call letting him know that we need to come back AGAIN to sign some more papers. What are the papers you ask? We don't know because the salesman doesn't know. Well thanks so much for calling without any helpful information, sounds like something that should just be mailed to us because if I go back in, it will be to return your truck and get my money. This has been the absolute worst car buying experience, and I will forevermore tell everyone I meet to never buy a car from Trucks Only.  I wish I could review this a second time for my husband who doesn't want to deal with it.   Our problems with this place continue.  Turns out they needed more money for that truck as well. We returned it instead. It's been over a week and we're still waiting on our refund, despite having been assured it would only be a few days. If that money doesn't show up very quickly, I'll be speaking to a lawyer over the damage to our credit, and them not refunding us. This is absolutely THE WORST company.  I should also mention that both times we were there, we were the only customers and we still sat around waiting. They ran our credit EIGHT times. EIGHT. That's pretty damaging to anyone, particularly people who are in the process of rebuilding theirs.

I've been here twice now, and the first time I loved it. I'm from San Diego and we have pretty high standards for good Mexican food since we're surrounded by it. The carne asada was delicious. The second time, I waited over 30 minutes for my burrito to be done, and people who ordered after me got their orders first. I was irritated, but it was the lunch rush so I was trying to be understanding. Then my burrito contained every nasty piece of meat. Fat, gristle, weird crunchy pieces, it goes on. Disgusting.  Overall I'd give their food a 4, but between the service and terrible quality of my most recent order it plummets to a 1.

I took my husband here for breakfast for his birthday. It was very good! I had the huevos rancheros and the green chile pork was delicious! The rest of it was good too. My husband had bacon and eggs and he said it was good. The staff was friendly and we were served quickly. We'll definitely go again

Jamie was my midwife throughout my pregnancy and labor. She was amazing! She's so sweet and friendly. I loved going in for my appointments. Midwives Rising! Has a wonderful family atmosphere. It feels like you're part of a family with them, and they treat your pregnancy and labor as a family event. My husband and mom came with to appointments and got to ask any questions they had, and they were both present at my birth. Jamie was fully supportive of all my birth choices and allowed my husband to be my main support, while being there to support us both. I had some difficulties during labor, and Jamie was very knowledgeable about ways to help me progress. That's something you don't get from an OB. I love  how having a midwife allows you to make your birth yours instead of being told how things should go. I would definitely recommend that everyone work with Jamie. My experience was amazing and I was so sad when my clinical visits were over. I'll be taking my little one in to visit on their open house days.

I chose this place based on the yelp reviews, and I'm super glad because it was awesome. My husband's the biscuits and gravy ("the country") and he said it was the best gravy he's ever had and he's had a lot, it's his breakfast of choice wherever we are. I had the house hash. It had huge chunks of corned beef, green chiles, and onions. It was fairly spicy as I found out after giving a bite to a small child. It was served on potatoes that were super yummy too. Highly recommend this place.

The burgers were really good, one of the best I've had. They grind their own hamburger meat and you can definitely tell. Their fries are delicious and I had a chocolate chili shake that was really good too. We're pretty new to Phoenix and this place will definitely be someplace we go again and tell people about

This place was delicious. The service was awesome. My husband and I had an aloe beitini and a Kirin. My tini was amazing. So refreshing! You couldn't taste the alcohol at all. We had the Bei special roll, a red dragon, and a volcano roll. They were all fabulous. We had our 11 month old daughter with us, and they were so attentive to her. They brought us miso soup and a small bowl of steamed rice, complementary. She loved it. Total, we spent just over $43 plus a tip. We will definitely be back and we can't wait have family come to visit so we can take them too
