The only thing good about this place is that they did a nice job painting my nails.  This place is really dirty... The walls need a good wipe down... They are just plain dirty. The mirrors are covered with dust and are nasty. God only knows how clean their pedicure bowls and mani/pedi equipment are. This place is super crammed too. I would have walked out upon arrival but I decided to risk it.  They want cash only unless it's the last resort... They will take your debit card.    $25 for a gel manicure and I think it was $20 for a regular pedi.  Save your money and go somewhere clean!

I have lived many places and this is by far the best place! The property is so clean and quiet! Sometimes I wonder if I have neighbors because I never hear them... And I even live on the second floor of a 3 story building.   I have had a couple maintenance needs and the staff was more than accommodating with my circumstances (I never give permission to enter when I am not there).... Yet everything is always fixed within a timely manor. For instance my a/c went out and I went to work that morning and decided to wait for the office to open before I called. Although the maintenance man was out working on other urgent calls .. Office staff was able to have maintenance to my door to meet me within 15 minutes of my call. I was worried it may be too hot for my pet in the hot apartment. Maintenance climbed up on the roof and fixed my issue within 10 minutes! wow! I was so grateful.  Not only this ... They throw some awesome events with prizes, food and sometimes alcohol. Kind of a fun opportunity to meet your neighbors!   The floor plans are very spacious and clean. I have an upgraded apartment and love it!  You can't beat the safe neighborhood, you're close to everything (grocery stores, the mall, freeway access), super pet friendly with a gated dog park... It can't get much better   Office staff and maintenance team are absolutely wonderful!

I had a really great experience here. I was a little nervous about coming here after reading the reviews.  I recently moved to Chandler from Avondale and needed a new vet. My dog is pretty healthy so I figured I would try to find a new vet when the time was right. Unfortunately my dog go sick in the night with vomiting and diarrhea  and i wanted to get her in ASAP. A friend of mine recommended Banfield and being frantic trying to find a vet to see i decided to give Banfield a try.  The office staff was fantastic and they got me in immediately. They originally thought i would have to drop my dog off and they would squeeze her in when they could. Fortunately for me I didnt have to drop her off and they got us in and out within the hour.  I ended up purchasing a wellness plan just for any future appointments that i might need to make or instances like the one i had today. I am so grateful for the Veterinarian and the staff. They were very upfront about the costs and did everything they could to help me save money. I am so appreciative.  ...Plus they were so loving and friendly with my pup :)  Highly reccomended

So i have been to this place once but loved it. They have a great atmosphere and unique setting. I had to stand in line for about 10-15 minutes to order my food but hey... no big deal! I ordered the Turkey and Cranberry sandwich with brie cheese (i forget what they named it at the restaurant). But the food was terrific and the service was great. One of my friends ordered the Mac and Cheese burger and loved it too. Its pretty quick to get your food once you have ordered.  Such a cute place with great food! Highly reccomended

THIS IS SOLELY BASED ON THE PET HOTEL. I took my dog here for day camp just to try it out before i take a trip in September and actually board her. I was told that my 5lb maltese would be in a "play room" with dogs her size. Being the nervous dog mom that i am... i wanted to make sure that she was matched up with dogs her size. They went ahead and took my dog back to the play area. I wanted to see how she was doing... so the woman told me i could go and check on her if i wanted. If i walked down to the dog food isle i would be able to see how she was doing. Immediately i noticed that she was in the same room as a husky, boxer, lab and other large dogs. Within 5 minutes of being there she had large dogs jumping on here and then had her cornered.... she was terrified. Even other Petsmart shoppers made comments about how "that small dog should not be in there with those big dogs" The gentleman working in the play room was not even paying attention. He was filling out some paperwork and looking the other direction in excess of about 10 minutes. At this point i decided topull my dog out of the room.   Why would you tell me that my dog is being put in there with dogs of her size... when i go and look there are dogs in there (the majority) that have 40+ lbs on her... that are not playing gently. The front office still tried to charge me $15 for the day camp. lol what a joke... Take your dog to Wiggles and Wags... its cheaper, family owned... and its quite apparent they have a huge love for animals. PetSmart Pet hotel... what a joke...  The professionalism was ridiculous as well. i will never return

I love this place. I have been taking my 3 year old Maltese, Lilly, here for 2 years now. They have done the best job with her haircuts! I have taken my dog to Petco and PetSmart on other occasions but Pet Stop by far surpasses both of these places.   Not only do they do a great job... they have always been really sweet to my dog. Lilly is terrified of going with strangers but they always are so sweet to her and make her comfortable.   You cant beat the prices either. I have been paying $38 for a full groom/bath and "expressions".  Unfortunately I have moved to Chandler and wont be able to keep coming back :(

I can't say that I've actually been to this zoo but I've been to the restaurant inside!!! This place is such a cool place!!! You can eat southern style comfort food and watch sharks swim while you eat!! There are flamingos on the back patio and an albino alligator in the bar ( behind glass of course). Very family friendly :)

I lived at Red Hawk for nearly two years and i have some mixed reviews about living here.   Negatives: * This place has very thin walls... you can hear your neighbors walking around above you if you are not on the top floor....you can hear EVERYTHING (lol_ * If you live near the pool beware of late night pool parties in the summer time. I dont mind a pool party but when its midnight on a weeknight and you are trying to sleep its not so much fun. They do have a security patrol and pool hours but these are never enforced. Oftentimes people jump over the fence after hours for a late night swim. * The office manager Anna is insanely rude. To be honest I don't even know how she got to be in the position that she is in. I asked to have my battery replaced in my smoke detector on a 10 foot ceiling. I could not reach even with a step stool. I asked if maintenance could replace it. Anna gave me a very hard time about it... saying that there are elderly people that live here that can replace it themselves but why couldn't I? Every encounter i have had with her... she is always rude or angry. * Guest parking is very difficult on weekends (but this is common in most apartment complexes) *Many reported home/car break-ins during the holiday season. A security gate was recently added to help with this. * I have had my front doormat, holiday wreaths stolen off my doorstep  Positives * Very clean property! * Decent rent prices * Jen in the office is fantastic (very friendly and helpful) * Very spacious apartments * Large balconies *No scorpions the whole time I lived here  If you are looking for similar rent prices in a good neighborhood i would suggest looking in Goodyear/Avondale. Its much quieter and more safe :)

I have been taking my dog Lilly here for about a year now. I have been more than pleased with all the office staff. The Veterinarians are very knowledgable and compassionate. Keep in mind that this is not an emergency clinic. They do have a Vet on call but they are not open 24 hours a day. I have been nothing but satisfied with the service and care provided and would highly reccomend them as a care provider.

My first and only time coming here was last night for a work party. I had an Italian margarita which was fantastic and the food was great too! The ambiance was similar to your typical mom and pop style restaurant and the service was phenomenal. I would definitely return.

I hired this company because of the great reviews that i saw here on yelp.The owner Jim is the one who responds to the emails and phone calls. He was very upfront about the costs and extra charges (Stair Charges- living on second floor of an apartment complex) as well as a fuel surcharge fee.   The movers arrived on time and moved very quickly. They were very careful with my items and were very courteous. Honestly, I was surprised how quickly these guys moved given their age...it was pretty impressive!   I moved from Avondale to Chandler and the guys trailed behind us on the treck to my new apartment. The only strange thing was we sat and waited for 45 minutes at my new apartment waiting for them to arrive. It turns out they decided to take a lunch while on the road? Which is kind of strange... but they did not charge us for the extra hour that it took them to arrive at my new home.  I had a few broken dishes that i noticed while unpacking but hey... things happen right (not a big deal). Maybe I didn't pad them good enough?  I budgeted about $550 for the move but it was only $365.  Very impressed with these guys! Highly recommended!

The food here is pretty good and its location makes it a great place to eat. So many shops near by and lots of action. Its really nice if you can sit out on the patio on a nice day! Drinks are great!

I first of all must state that i am a bit of a hotel snob. I found this place to be absolutely wonderful! Perfect location on the strip just next to the Bellagio and centrally located. We stayed in a Delux Suite on the 25th floor and had amazing views  and a partial view of the Bellagio Fountain. The bed was extremely comfortable and the soaking tub, kitchenette and small living room was perfect. Although it was just my boyfriend and I who stayed... It would be perfect for a small family. The couch in the living room pulls out and turns into a bed. There is one TV in the bedroom and one in the Livingroom as well. We paid 169 per night which included the taxes and resort fee.  Also... we had to call for some more towels to be delivered... housekeeping had them to our door within 5 minutes. Great service  Another great thing... is that the hotel is really quiet. There is not a casino in this hotel and there is a nice little cafe and also a bar downstairs. I would stay here again...especially for the price.

The Biltmore is a beautiful resort and I would definitely reccomend this place! Beautiful landscaping and nightly or daily activities for adults and children. The pools are gorgeous and the decorative flowers make this place amazing. I would say that the rooms are average but the beds are comfy. Definitely reccomended!

We ordered the mozzarella cheese balls which were delicious... especially with the sauce that it comes with. However, the service was extremely slow... it took nearly an hour to get our food. The manager came and apologized... she was a sweet heart and definitely wanted to make sure we had a good experience.  Once our food came out we were still disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the bison which was smothered in a brown sauce. The sauce made the bison taste disgusting :( and i ordered the salmon pasta. The pasta was really great but after about 8 bites it was a bit too rich for my taste.   Also, we sat outside on the patio eating our dinner. A husband and wife pulled up right next to our table in their jeep (in a non parking space) and their dogs were barking at us the whole time we were there lol. I am an animal lover but i certainly don't want to be barked at by animals while trying to enjoy my dinner.   ...on a positive note... the pumpkin cheesecake was fantastic

I love Pinks!! I come to Vegas every couple of months and always have to make sure i stop and get a Pinks Hot Dog. Yeah... .most people complain about the price on here...but hey... the only thing that is much cheaper on the strip is McDonalds! I paid about 6 for a hot dog and it was great! They have fantastic chili cheese fries and chili dogs too! Between my boyfriend and I we usually spend about 30 dollars when we go. The service is great too!

I read the reviews before coming here... I thought this place would be a great new park to take my dog to since we just moved to the area. Prior, we had been going to the surprise dog park. Within 15 minutes of getting there my dog was attacked by 3 pittbulls. The owner could have cared less nor did he try to pull their dogs off mine. I fought these dogs off mine until I could free her. I was so in fear for my dogs life I rushed her off to the ER Vet and didn't get contact info. I had a $900 bill and needless to say I will never return. I know this is an isolated incident but please beware of aggressive dogs at this park.

I have been taking my car here to Michael for about 3 years now. I completely trust Michael and his business. He has always been fair and always goes above and beyond the call of duty. He does amazing work at an affordable price. Thank you guys!! You have saved me thousands of dollars!!  - I live in Chandler now... and i still take my car to this shop!

Fantastic doctors office. I have seen both Mrs. DR Maitra and Mr. DR Maitra as well as P.A. Amy Macelli. I have received nothing but great care and concern by each doctor here. They are always able to get me in if its urgent and I rarely have to wait more than 5 minutes before i am taken back into a room. When i call and have a question for the doctor... I always get a call back from the head nurse within 3-5 hours. I suppose some people may complain about 3-5 hours but i guess if you need answers sooner... maybe you should go to the ER lol.  Highly Reccomended :)

I lived here during 2011 -2013 this place is gorgeous and has great landscaping and pools. I lived in a two car garage apartment and my apartment was infested with scorpions. I reported it to the management staff on multiple occasions. They had my apartment sprayed on a weekly basis. One month i had 5 scorpions alone! Finally the leasing office just said there was nothing more that they could do... scorpions make trails and my apartment just happens to be on a scorpion trail.  Office staff is not friendly.

I took my tiny maltese Lilly here for daycare and was so happy with this place! We wanted to try this place out before we actually boarded her here for an upcoming vacation. The staff was nothing short of amazing and made Lillys first day at doggy day care  a great experience. Knowing my dog... I knew she had a great time just from how she was acting when I picked her up. One happy girl. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to board their dog or even try the doggy daycare.

The service was great! I had no complaints. I was a little sad because the couch i ordered was on back order and would take 2 weeks to be delivered  (but that is really nobody's fault). The delivery guys offloaded my couch and had it in to my apartment within minutes. They were so fast! I had a great experience overall

Susan did such an amazing job altering my Bridesmaid dress. She truly knows what she is doing and also knows how to flatter a curvy body!  I was nervous about the fact that she works out of her home but.... it was so perfect. She has a fitting room and lots of mirrors. I was nothing but pleased about her work as well as the quick turn around time!

Although we did not stay at the hotel we did visit the rooftop bar. This bar is phenomenal! The drinks had the right amount of alcohol to where you didnt feel like you were drinking juice nor did you feel like they were over powering. The live band was absolutely fantastic! I would definitely return!

The only nice thing about this place is the curb appeal and the interior of the apartment home. Once the sun goes down this place turns in to a loud party. Cars with loud exhausts, people outside yelling and partying all hours of the night. My parked car got side swiped in the middle of the night and the owner never tried to contact me. Turns out my car had about 6k work of damage. There are much nicer places out here for the same price.   If you are new to town looking for a nice place to move... try looking out in Goodyear. Its much cleaner and quieter.

This place has a great atmosphere and when you sit outside you have a nice view of the strip. The food isnt anything spectacular and the service was lacking. I probably wouldnt return but I am glad i checked the place out.

Love this place. Its nothing fancy but they do a great job for a decent price. I used to go to a very high end Salon in Portland before i moved here and this place is better and half the cost.  I was seeing a new stylist for the first time- Stephanie. She was absolutely fantastic! I was looking for a specific hair color/look and she nailed it! My expectations were exceeded! Thank you! I will be back

We came here after watching a play at the Hale theater. First we started off with margaritas and I ordered the Blood Orange....omg it was tasty. They don't short you on the tequila either. I ordered the standard taco, carne adobada and the shrimp tacos. I have to say they were all amazing but my favorite was the carne adobada! I would definitely return. Very nice outdoor seating too!

My two friends and I came here for the first time and had a blast! None of us have ever gone to an art class in our lives and can barely draw stick people. We brought our own wine, chatted, painted, and laughed (a lot). The staff was amazing and helpful... for us that are not so artistic. I loved how everything was done step by step and it was easy to follow. I will definitely return. We just signed up for the paint your pet night! Cant wait
