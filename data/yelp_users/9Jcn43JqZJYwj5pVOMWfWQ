Delicious Cerviche! I've lived down the road from this place almost 5 months and finally stopped tonight. I did take out just for me. I'm originally from New England and seafood is my favorite and obviously pretty sparse here in Arizona. I saw "fresh seafood" out front and hoped for some cerviche. It was indeed fresh! I got the shrimp and octopus mix. Also got an order of guacamole which was very good too! I will be returning.

Last 2 times I haven't been overly impressed with this place. It doesn't seem like a very friendly or welcoming environment personally. I am always asked about what I'd like done and they don't seem to follow through on my requests. I have noticed the last couple times hair is always never trimmed around the mouth and the hair is left sticking inside the mouth. Pickup times always change and once they call they expect you ASAP and tell you they are closing early on several occasions. Sorry but customer service is lacking here.

Sorry not impressed at all with your location at 19th ave and Northern. It's a fast food setting and items that are being advertised are not available like tabouli. The two girls working acted like it wasn't even part of the menu. The young girl cook was asking what was in the plate that I ordered. I ordered the steak kabob plate and the steak was super tough. Not going back sorry.

I had a wonderful facial here and then rebooked for a massage. The day my massage was scheduled I unfortunately was diagnosed with strep throat. Which is highly contagious. I called them to cancel and they told me I would be charged $49 or I needed to come to the appt. Horrible policy. They'd risk someone coming in sick to their establishment with a contagious disease or want you to pay $49. Sorry but I even offered to show them my receipt to dr office. Nope it's "policy" the manager said. Not cool!  ***update-I felt inclined to respond to the unprofessional comment left by the owner. FYI  I did go in to get my massage that day instead of just handing over $49. At the end of the massage I was sure to tell the massage therapist that I tried cancelling due to sickness and he seemed very upset. He had a young baby at his home whom he obviously didn't want ill. He made sure I knew that  I knew that this happened often at this place and it was one reason why he can't keep staff because of the poor management/ownership. Clearly it's just a matter of time before this place closes its doors. There are a 100 other places to choose in the area over this place which are run professionally and take care of their customers and staff appropriately.  My experience is 100% truthful and I will not be bullied. Please check others reviews as well. Thank you

Great pizza but the last 2 times I've ordered its never ready and I have to sit and wait in drive through at least 15 minutes. Let us know if your running behind so we don't need to sit in scorching heat. Not happy.

Love this place! Always friendly, great customer service, clean, thorough work, good prices, excellent pedicure and gel nails. Best and longest foot massage. I have been going for about 10 months every few weeks. I will keep returning as they always take care of me :)

Jessica came to clean today at my 1010 sq ft condo. She was prompt, friendly and asked me what was important that she did. It was a great experience using this service and I would love to have her come back again! Thank you!

The only thing this place has going for them is their late night hours after the bars close on 7th St. I've gotten food here a couple time and not impressed. It's a shack restaurant on the site of the road and when sitting outside waiting for food there are dogs barking on the side of restaurant. The shrimp fried rice was burnt period.
