What a gem!  This place is definitely our GO TO sushi spot, and not just because it's on our neighborhood.  The only time I've had better sushi, we were in San Francisco.

I am new to the waxing routine and now I'm addicted to it.  EWC is comfortable, professional and all around pleasant.  I drive out of my way to be waxed by Brandi at this location.  She is the absolute best.  Professional, puts you at ease and is so freaking fast.  I can't say enough about the product line they carry as well.  Even if I no longer waxed, I would still purchase the body wash, exfoliate and after - soothing-elixir-serum stuff.    They always have sales/specials going on it seems and I really like the payment plans they have for the packages they offer.  Very affordable and I never feel pressured to make a purchase I really don't want to make.    The front desk staff is always pleasant as well.

The service was horrible.  Our waitress would disappear for large chunks of time that we would have to go to the bar and ask for service.  It wasn't busy at all so that kind of service is ridiculous.  The sushi was sub par at best.  I won't be going here ever again.

This is definitely first on the list when we discuss where we would like to go for some food and a drink, plus is walking distance to Fox's Cigar bar.  We have always had great service and the food is always yummy.
