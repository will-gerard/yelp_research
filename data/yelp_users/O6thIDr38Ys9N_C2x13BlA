Went there today, very good food, I would suggest the breakfast burrito, the machaca was very good. I also ordered a crispy beef taco that seemed to be a little bit to greasy for my liking. Overall very good though!!

I went to both locations that Flancers has in Mesa and Gilbert  Mesa- food was good, I had the new Shrimp Sand which that they offered with french fries that were really good, the bread was also great.The only complaint I have about the Mesa location was the staff, our waitress had a verbal argument with the manager in front of all the diners.. and the manager argued right back at her. It was very bad management and didnt make us feel "at home.." service was lacking.  Gilbert- had the same sandwich, I asked for shredded lettuce on the sandwich and our waiter proceeded to tell me that it had shredded lettuce on the sandwich (which i knew wasn't true).. went ahead and let him have his way.. and low and behold DIDNT have shredded lettuce. He apologized but the whole situation was annoying.  Overall there food is awesome, but the staff could be a little more educated on manners and how to treat patrons.

Im dining in the restaurant as we speak- note to self- don't come here again.   When you walk in it's confusing- everyone is cramped into the front or in a little door entrance   It took the server 10 minutes to approach our table and take our order  Food took 20-25 min to get to us, I ordered the biscuits and gravy and clearly the gravy was from a can with about 2 specs of sausage in it. I sent it back and they offered me some more toast or home fries. No thanks.   Price seems kind of high for a breakfast place especially since the food sucks. 8.00 for biscuits and gravy with toast and hash browns.   Go somewhere else before your disappointed like I am.

We saw a travelzoo voucher and decided to try this place on a whim. The food was delicious. The waitstaff was very friendly and informative with the menu. We had the cheesy garlic bread that was to die for. Hubby had the filet with the "potato ball" side that was a fried potato ball that was filled with cheese, bacon and ham. It was Betty flavorful. Steak was cooked perfect. I had the lobster ravioli with pink sauce. We are picky eaters and were thoroughly impressed with our food. Would defiantly recommend and return.

We dined there last week. Everything was delicious and the service was 5 stars. The shrimp cocktail was HUGE! My friend and I split 4 shrimp, the 16 oz bone in filet, and we ordered 3 sides: Brussel sprouts, mushrooms and asparagus. The Brussel sprouts and mushrooms were delicious- the asparagus left a little to be desired (they were small, kind of tasteless). The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned well. I will definitely return to Steak 44.

Dr. Olson and his staff are TOP NOTCH. I have never met a surgeon with a better bedside manner than Dr. Olson. After meeting him at my consultation he throughly explained all of the procedures that I would need done. I once did not feel rushed, and felt like he took the time to listen to my questions or concerns. (I have lost 150 lbs and need multiple different procedures to remove my excess skin). His office staff is great and respond almost immediately to calls and emails. Dr. Olson went beyond my expectations and I couldn't have asked for a greater out come on my first procedure. (Anchor Cut Tummy Tuck, Breast Lift and Augmentation). He called the night after my surgery to see how I was doing and to see if I had any questions or concerns, and is very quick to respond to my questions or concerns post op wise. I would recommend him to any of my friends.
