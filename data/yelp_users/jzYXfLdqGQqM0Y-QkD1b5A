My boyfriend and I recently came in and worked with Debby.  The experience was lackluster and really uncomfortable at times.  Debby was extremely impersonable.  She didn't greet us with a smile nor did she really bother to learn our names.  My boyfriend had come into the dealership intending to purchase a specific vehicle, but upon learning it was missing a few key features, he wanted to keep looking.  Debby did help us by pulling up the Penske online catalogue, but that was about it.  No suggesting other models, no showing us what our options would be if we increased our budget, no attempt to close us whatsoever... She seemed absolutely uninterested in helping us make a transaction with Audi.  It was the most bizarre retail experience I've ever had.  When she called over a week later in an attempt to follow up, I asked her to send us any new inventory that fit our criteria.  We haven't heard from her since.  My boyfriend and I are sales professionals and have been on the other side of the coin.  It feels like Debby did not have enough respect for us to think we would actually make a purchase.  We're still in the market for a new vehicle, and would probably go back to the dealership, but we definitely wouldn't work with Debby.

I always over order when I come to Guido's.  It's just so hard to make a decision.  Their sandwiches are HUUUUGE.  My favorite is the proscuitto caprese sandwhich, which is just stuffed with proscuitto.  All of their pastas are great as well and I can't ever seem to leave without ordering calamari.  Quite the little gem of the neighborhood!

Ugh.. not worth the drive and definitely not worth your time.  You'll get nothing out of the ordinary with Great Wall Cuisine - a few dim sum carts with your standard fare, an outdated banquet hall, and subpar service.  But even that, I can deal with, because I live in PHX and there's like, two places that serves dim sum.  What I can't get with is charging TWENTY dollars for pea shoots.  Are you kidding me????  But I guess it's my fault for ordering off the menu, right?  My fault for assuming that there's no way they'd charge more than ten bucks for sauteed veggies at an old school Chinese restaurant in a deserted strip mall.  SILLY ME!!  I always knew my people were tricksy.  It was just a matter of time before I fell for one.

I found these guys on Yelp. I thought I had huge problem with my front left wheel, I did some research and thought I had a bad bearing. It looked like the approximate across the board was about $400.  I left my car with the technician, easy paperwork, he told me to give him a couple of hours.   I came back, he said "there was no need to start throwing parts in the car, let's just put a new set of tires on it." I replaced the tires and the issue was fixed.   The point here is they could have made me replace the bearing and get new tires, and I wouldn't have know the difference. Honest hard working guys. If you are coming on a Saturday make sure you get there early, they start filling tickets in the AM.

With 80+ check-ins here, it's safe to say I love this place.  It has all of the right ingredients of a great coffee house. Friendly staff, eclectic decor, comfy seating spaces, and a great menu.  My go-to here is the dirty chai (drinking one right meow).  They stir up all of the iced latte drinks before they pour them so the consistency is extra creamy.  Most of the food is made in-house, along with their muffins.  Seriously - no better way to be greeted in the morning than by a tray of muffins hot out of the oven.  If you live in the neighborhood, don't forget to sign up for their loyalty program.  For every 10 drinks, you get one free.  You'd be surprised how quickly they accumulate.  Love you guys, keep doing what you're doing!

Meh, I'm a fan.  When you want something predictable but solid, you go to sauce.  I'd avoid the pastas, but everything else on the menu is good!  My favorite is not the pizza here, but the turkey and feta salad.  Get light feta if you don't want your salad to be half cheese.  It's a great combinations of flavors and it fills you up quickly!

It's day 3 of EDC.  I feel defeated.  The only thing that I want is something warm and comforting and lo and behold, I stumble across this Yelp listing.  A beacon of light in my post-EDC haze.  The reviews all warn a 2-3hour wait, but boyfriend and I were optimistic (how?).  It's not going to happen to us, we're going to get there and we're going to EAT.  So we pumped ourselves up to put on actual clothes and trekked our way off the strip and back into the 1980's.  The Palace Station is definitely not the place to be seen, but it houses this magnificent gem.  You find it by looking for the massive line of hungry, salivating people.   When all of the seats are taken, it really does take the predicted two hours before you'll get served, so prepare to wait.  We did.  But it was OH. SO. WORTH. IT.  Get the pan roast.    This was one of the best things I've ever eaten.    If you're here with a friend, don't even think about trying anything else.  Just get two orders of pan roast.  You'll end up fighting over it.  And definitely get one to go too so you can take it home and eat it when you're hung over.  Imagine the creamiest tomato soup with all of your favorite seafood served over rice and that's what the pan roast is.  The ultimate comfort food, upgraded.  My mouth is watering.    And if you're reading this as you're waiting in line... DON'T GIVE UP, YOU ARE SO CLOSE!  And if you are my friend or even an acquaintance who has my phone number, please get me an order of pan roast and I will venmo you when you get back to the 'dale.

My interactions with veterinarians are limited.  My family cat is a beautiful prissy princess who HATES the vet.  It took us so many reschedules just to get her in a carrier that we just stopped trying.  I know, I know, some of you owners out there are scoffing at this statement.. but hey~ Furbs is 15 years old and loving life.  To each their own.  So anywho, I can't speak to how experienced, knowledgable, or trustworthy the veterinarians are.  We just took our newly adopted kitteh here for a basic check up.  What I can say is that the staff was absolutely amazing to work with and I can't wait to take my kitten back.  They were obsessed with him as soon as we walked in and what pet lover doesn't want to see another human fawn over their bebe (whether human or cat).  Before we left, they surprised us with a HUGE gift basket full of toys, a cat bed, treats, and other goodies.  Apparently one of their other patients won it and donated it back to the clinic to give to the next person who adopted a kitten.  Lucky us, I guess.  But they were so genuinely excited to give it to us!  You can tell everyone really loves cats here and wants the best for their patients.  Couldn't have asked for a better experience for Bear's first visit to the vet and we look forward to have them take care of him.

I love Asian restaurants like this.  It's a dingy hole-in-the-wall and it's SO GOOD and SO CHEAP.  I avoided coming to this place for YEARS because it's right next door to unPhogettable and that place is so hard to say no to.  One day my boyfriend insisted on trying something new and forced me to come here against my will.  I was pissed.  But then I walked in and spied with my hungry little eye this huge plate of grilled meats and got put in my place.  If this is your first time here, you HAVE to get the spring rolls with charboiled sausage.  It comes in this delightfully orange and pink shrimp paste dip and the flavors together is pure magic.  In the roll itself is a strip of deep fried wonton wrapper and creates a surprisingly pleasant crunch and great texture.  For your entree, definitely get the broken rice with 10 things because WHY NOT.  Pork? yes. Short ribs? YES! Chinese sausage? Yes yes! Deep fried roll thing with shrimp in it? Yes yes yes! AND little pieces of deep fried pork belly scattered across the plate?! AHHHHHHHHHH.  Just thinking about this meal makes me so happy.  One star down because service is quite bad.  Just prepare to flag down your waiter.

**Disclaimer - this review is purely based on their food.  I've never dined in due to the bad reviews about service, and if you live close, I'd recommend getting carry out as well.  Even the little interaction I have with people over the phone seem to indicate that service isn't that great.  That being said, I'm a firm believer that bad service should never stop you from enjoying good food, especially when it's this good!  If you're new to Indian food and want something other than Chicken Tikka, try their vindaloo. We always get lamb, but I'm sure the chicken is great as well if you're not a fan of lamb.  The thing that really makes this dish is the potatoes.  Oh my gad.  They completely absorb the flavours of the sauce and just melt in your mouth.  Wing lovers, you HAVE to get the tandoori wings.  A squeeze of lemon is a must, as it brings out the smokiness of the grill.    If you want to avoid meat, they have plenty of vegetarian options.  My boyfriend's favorite vegetarian dish is their Malai Kofta - huge veggie dumplings cooked in a creamy tomato sauce.  Apparently this is a really hard dish to get right, and theirs knocks it out of the park.  This is a restaurant my boyfriend would take his Indian mother to - a true testament to how great everything tastes.  Highly recommend!

This is my favorite trail in the city.  It's a great workout.  There are probably three sections of ascensions and the first one is pretty steep, so make sure to pace yourself!  The best part of this trail are the plants and wildlife.  Right now is probably the best time to go because the cactus is blooming and there are hawks nesting at the peak.  Also, be careful!  The trail is really gravely so make sure to watch your step coming down.

I was a loyal customer here for close to two years, and am sad to say that I have to take my business elsewhere.  About a year ago, they lost my favorite white sweater.  The good news is, they owned up to it, and asked us to submit a claim.  We did.  One year later... no sweater, no processed claim.  It's not like we didn't try.  I submitted two claims and left several notes for the owner (who is NEVER in the shop), but every time the notes and claims are ignored.  Whenever I call or go in to follow up, there's always different people working, so they never know what I'm talking about.  It's such a shame, because they get the job done for a decent price, but I can't keep spending my money at an establishment who clearly do not care about their regulars.

I come here about once a month to help my crooked back. As far as convenience goes, you can't beat The Joint. I come in during my lunch hour and I'm in and out within 15 minutes.   Dr. Judge is great. Twice I've had to come in because I injured myself to the point of limited mobility. Both times I was back to normal within a few days. The most recent was a shoulder injury. I was actually out of town when this happened and went to a full service chiropractor seeking relief. The other chiropractor hooked me up to a bunch of fancy  machines and... no results. Time and money wasted.  Came back to Dr. Judge yesterday and immediate relief.   If you have any issues with your back, I highly recommend coming in for an adjustment before you seek additional, expensive treatment.

OMGILOVETHISPLACE.   Northern Chinese cuisine is not prevalent in the US and it is the food of my family. So every time I'm sick and mopey my lovely Chan-cakes will make the trek from the North 'dale to Chandler to get me some meat pies, eggplant, and sour cabbage soup.   Now let me talk about the sour cabbage soup. Sour cabbage is the north Chinese equivalent of sauerkraut. It is made with Napa cabbage and is traditionally buried in dirt as part of the fermentation process. When I was little I used to watch my grandmother fill jars and jars of this stuff and it would stink up her kitchen for months. It is my absolute favorite food and it is magnificent and cures all of the home sickness. Get it with pork and frozen tofu. When tofu is frozen and defrosted the texture turns spongey and it soaks up all of the brothy goodness. If you are brave enough to order this dish, you have a special place in my heart.   For those of you who gagged a little at the words "sour" and "cabbage" side by side, try their sweet and sour pork. The Northerners make it differently than your average China Wok. The meat is flattened and deep fried then drenched in a sauce that's a little thicker and more sour than the normal red sauce.  It is also fantastic cold at 1am and cures the heaviest of munchies.   Oh, and do yourself a favor and order one of their meat pies. Do you know how delightful it is to bite into a crispy vinegar-soaked meat pie? Did you make a teeny bite like I did then drink up the meat juices? If so, see above for the special place in my heart for people who ordered the sour cabbage soup. This is the ultimate food porn.   One last thing. The lamb skewers. This I don't always order because I'm usually too full from all of the above.  But if you want to know what the streets of the North smell like on the coldest of winter days, this is it. Back in the homeland, nothing filled this little piggy with more delight than this street meat delicacy. You know it's real authentic because there is so much msg goodness in these meats and the skewers are dangerously sharp. Get two orders, because you'll want more.

My boyfriend recently had a big birthday, and I recently saw that as an excuse to go to ShinBay.   Seriously - if you're a foodie, you need to do this at least once.  Don't listen to the reviews about quantity.  The food was plenty.  We had the 6-course Omakase and were stuffed by course four.  Do I regret the other two courses?  NOPE.  Because this was some of the most delicious and beautiful food I have ever eaten.  Please refer to the photos for each course and get ready to salivate.  They speak for themselves.  Service was impeccable, as expected.  Our server was extremely attentive.  Everyone greeted us by name.  The staff even gave my boyfriend a birthday card!    Amazing experience, overall.  Would definitely come again.

Amazing job by Steve!  I bought a white shag rug about six months ago (I know, what was I thinking), and it was already looking pretty worn out.  I called Steve after finding him on Yelp and chose him because he sounded like an honest guy and also offered free pick up and delivery!    He came to my house that day to do the evaluation and pick up and was very upfront about the results we would get and didn't hard sell me on getting the rug cleaned.  He was also very informative about the normal wear and tear of different kinds of rug material and advised me on what type of rug I should get next time.    We just got the rug back today and it looks gorgeous.  Thank you for a job well done, Steve!  We'll definitely use you again in the future!

When I own a home, I want my kitchen and dining room to be exactly like Crudo.  Guys, this is one of the best tasting menus in Phoenix.  For $35 you can choose three of ANYTHING on the menu.  So yes, if you want lamb belly, pork belly, AND brisket in one meal, you can have it.  YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL!  But you probably shouldn't, because obesity.  My boyfriend and I came here last night for a late birthday dinner and had an amazing time.  First of all, THEY HAVE FOUR KINDS OF PAPPY VAN WINKLE ON MENU.  FOUR.  Boyfriend really wanted you to know that.  Because that is really impressive. And if you're a bourbon fan, I've probably already sold you to come here.  If you aren't, let's move on to the food.  We both had the 3-course tasting menu. Crudo also offers four and five courses, but three was the perfect amount.  We started off with the yellowtail and octopus crudos.  The yellowtail was delicious, but nothing too unique.  The octopus was amazing and highly recommended!  I'm always hesitant to order octopus because when done wrong it chews like rubber, but this was not the case.  The octopus was so tender!  And the citrus oil really balanced the briny taste of the octopus.  For the second course I had the Gargati with mussels and uni butter.  This is a new addition to their menu and it is SO. GOOD.  I didn't really taste the uni butter, which might have been a good thing because the sauce wasn't overwhelmingly rich.  They sprinkle mint on top, which is great with the tomato.  Definitely going to be garnishing pastas like this at home.  For the third course I had the Market Fish and boyfriend had their Pork Belly.  You should definitely get the pork belly.  If you're worried your dinner will be too heavy, just get two crudos and the pork belly.  It was melt in your mouth delicious with the most buttery polenta.  I was so jealous boyfriend got to eat this and not me.  Service was absolutely amazing.  Their manager, Fran, came out to greet us with Prosecco for my birthday, which paired really well with the crispy pig ears (how can I forget to mention those until now!).  Bonus points: their dining music is your favorite Coachella playlist - Neon Indian, Yeasayer, Beach House.  Overall, one of the best dining experiences I have had in a while.  Next time, we're getting the whole roasted pig's head

The only thing that sucks about The Blind Pig is that it's so far away from my house now!  I used to live right across the street from and would come here at least twice a month.  Thank goodness they are now on DoorDash!  MUST GET: 1. Their taco combos.  My favorite meats are the al pastor and short rib. 2. Their house rice with pineapple and chorizo - best. rice. ever. and this is coming from a professional rice eater (Asian). 3. Recently tried this, don't know why I didn't do it sooner - their short rib entree.  YUM.  Mix the rice with the sauce and you've got one of the best combos out there.  Best part about this place is the price.  I ordered tacos for five people and spent $50.  They used to be a butcher, so the meat is top notch.    If you want some great Mexican food that's not heavy and full of beans, COME HERE!  You won't regret it :)

Slanted Rice has become our go-to for take out.  The owners are always so friendly and accommodating and everything we've tried have been delicious.  Faves: Pho - mandatory hangover cure.  SO MUCH better than Noodles Ranch.  There is actual complexity in the broth.  If you're a broth junkie like me, their scallion broth that comes with the entrees (and you can order separately as well) is the same as their pho broth.  Garlic Noodles - Such an genius idea!  Fragrant but not overbearing garlic flavor and some added mmmMMMmmmm with a sprinkle of cheese.  Great with sriacha if you're into spice.  Clay Pot Rice - I really wish they did this with Chinese sausage but ehhhhhh... What you're really looking to get here is that crispy rice goodness all around the clay pot.  DO NOT GET THIS TO GO.  You will miss out on the crispiness!  What you want to do is to mix everything together so you get all of the flavors of the chicken and mushrooms and sauce and the awesome crunch texture of the rice sprinkled in.  YUM.  Sooooo... not to be a Noodles Ranch hater, but seriously drive the two miles north and come try this place (all you Colonial Grand dwellers - looking at you).  You won't regret it!

This is some of the best cold pressed juice I've had. Try the boost. The name is fitting. One of the most refreshing beverages I've had! For those of you in Old Town, they have a location in fashion square. Bonus - the juices are cheaper than Juice Core, Kaleidoscope, or Chop Shop (although I do love them all  )

This place has become my new favorite restaurant and as I sit here writing this review (and procrastinating work), I'm contemplating whether or not I should guilt trip my boyfriend into taking me for the second time this week.  (I probably will).  Anyway, this place is SO UNDERRATED.  It's in this dinky strip mall, which makes you question your decision.  But don't judge the restaurant by the poorly marked parking lot, you NEED to go in and eat their delicious food.  Get the lemongrass broth.  Don't even worry about the others.  They're not as good.  I've tried them.  Just get the lemongrass.  It's by far the most flavourful and least MSG-y one they have.  Service is also top notch here.  No, the waiters here aren't bubbly, but it doesn't mean they're not good at their jobs.  My peanut sauce never runs dry (v. important), they're constantly adjusting the heat on the pots (also v. important), and they're always very honest with their suggestions.  Portion control is the biggest challenge here, as you don't want to over-order, but you also want to try EVERYTHING.  I have a pretty big appetite and two plates of meat was enough for myself and my boyfriend.    Here are a few things you should definitely try:  - Iced Tofu - when you freeze tofu it turns into little soy sponges and they soak up the broth and sauce oh-so-good.  Make sure you don't overcook!  - Prime Lamb - even if you don't really think you like lamb or have never tried lamb, this is a good start.  Because the lamb is sliced so thinly, it doesn't have that usual gamey lamb taste.  - Enoki Mushrooms - Not super earthy, so great for people who don't really "like" mushrooms.  They soak up the peanut sauce really well and have an amazing texture.  - The wagu beef, when they have it - self explanatory.  All in all, always a great experience here.  Worth the trek to central PHX.  Go check it out!

I love this place and love that it's right downstairs from my house.  Really clean salon and super cute branding!  The only setback is that they seem to have a lot of staff turnover, so the service isn't always consistent.  While everyone is super friendly and accommodating, there are definitely times where I got ingrown hairs because of inattention to detail.

If you know me, you know that I HAAAAATE exercise. Hate it! Gym? NAH!  Food? YASSSSSSS!  But unfortunately I no longer have the metabolism of a 23-year old, and what used to be a barely noticeable tummy pooch became a full blown belly in the last 8 months.  I recently had some time off so with a little bit of convincing from a very convincing girlfriend, I decided to give OTF a try - thanks, B!  One class and you will understand the hype.  This is a GREAT workout!  And what's better is that they never make you do the same thing for too long... so if you hate running as much as I do, don't worry - only 60 seconds before you can come down to a nice jog.  You're constantly moving from one station to another, you work out every part of your body, and before you know it, it's been 55 minutes.  I've been going 3 times a week this whole month and already my belly is down to my 23-year old pooch!  The onnnnly thing that I don't like is their membership policy.  Any changes you make to your membership needs 30-day notice.  While I understand this type of policy is standard for gyms if you want to cancel, it does suck when you need to upgrade or downgrade.  If you have a busy schedule and don't know how many classes you can get per month, I would recommend getting a package instead of a membership.

Solid nail spa!  I come here mainly because they do SNS manicures.  Ladies, if you haven't tried it yet, you need to!  I've been biting my nails since I was 4 years old and gel manicures really helped me combat that.  However, I replaced one bad habit with another - picking off my gel polish!  As a result, I was left with really thin and brittle nails.  SNS fixes that!  There's no UV light so you don't have to worry about exposing and aging your hands.  They apply an adhesive and dip your nails in powder.  The results are similar to hard gel from what I heard. The best part... it does not chip! I can't even pick at it because it's bonded to my nail.  Huge win.  The ambiance is really nice here as well.  Clean, comfortable and inviting.  The only thing I don't like about the spa is that service is hit or miss.  They always do a great job on my nails, but some of the technicians are really cold and stand-offish.

If you've met me for a hot minute, you know that I rarely drink.  However, I would gladly sacrifice a hangover for this place.    The bar is theme-based and the theme rotates every few months.  Their current theme is Chinatown, so everything on the menu aligns with this.  You'll find a lot of citrus and ginger flavors.  My boyfriend and I went there the other night and had a variety of cocktails.  My favorite one is the Sippin Tea in the LBC, recommended by my lovely mixologist.  It has a strong yuzu flavor, which is a japanese tangerine with really strong floral notes, and is delightful.  The prevalent alcohol is mezcal, which adds a really nice, smokey and throaty finish.  Everything else I tried was complex but well balanced and absolutely enjoyable to drink.  If you need a respite from the regular old town scene, I highly recommend coming over to Counter Intuitive!

I avoided going to Flower Child for the longest time because I heard that the food wasn't worth the price. Last night, I actually decided to check their menu and uhhhhhhh seriously what have I been doing with my life? I guess Asian smarts don't always include common sense because the prices here really aren't that bad.... and the food is GOOD.   I got two dinners for myself and my boyfriend (combined, not each; although we are both hungry hungry hippos). One was a steak plate with three sides: cauliflower, mac & cheese, and the watermelon tomato salad. We also got the forbidden rice bowl per the cashier's suggestion. Everything had a unique and delicious flavor. Complex but well balanced. Not only that all the different colors made the meal extremely aesthetically pleasing.   Home run, guys. I'll probably be in soon (like in 5 min).

This is such a cute cafe and I wish I lived closer!  We found this place on Yelp while heading into central PHX one Saturday and decided to stop by for a lighter lunch.  My boyfriend is obsessed with buffalo chicken sandwiches/wraps/pizzas so of course he ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich here.  I took a bite and have to say, it is the BEST buffalo chicken sandwich I've ever had!!  The difference between the food here and a lot of other places is the quality of ingredients.  The chicken tasted fresh, not drenched in buffalo sauce to hide the day-old taste like other places.  They use Noble Bread, which was delicious and chewy.  The green heirloom tomato gave the sandwich a delightful crunch.    It looks like they try to locally source their ingredients, which is great.  Service is very noncommittal hipster vibe, hence the 4 stars.  All in all, a great place for good food.  Highly recommended if you are in the area!

Can't complain about fresh oysters in a desert.  We spoke to the new guy there who was super friendly and knew a lot about their different oysters.  They seem like they usually have 6 or so different kinds and you can mix and match however many you want.  We had six of some of the most unique tasting oysters I've ever had.  Apparently something called a pea crab craws in their gills and lives in them, so when the oyster is shucked and eaten, you get an additional pop of flavor from the crab as well.  I definitely recommend trying it while you can!  They have happy hour on Tuesdays where the oysters are half off.  I'm definitely going to come back for that!

This is the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. We found this place a few weeks ago and were so eager to try it out. Safe to say I will never be a patron at this gimmick of a restaurant.  Our experience this morning was similar to Larry K.'s review. However, we weren't even given a wait time or a chance to be put on a guest list. The answer was simply, "no, we are full", even with three empty tables in sight.  In the middle of arguing with the hostess ( an older white haired lady ) to try and figure this mash out, a middle aged woman ( entitled soccer mom looking lady who claimed to be the owner; she's not ) tried to jump in to resolve the situation and ended up trying to reprimand my boyfriend.   Here's a tip: you're a new restaurant. Every customer should be equally as important to you. Plus, you should understand the whole situation before you jump in and assume the worst of people.   I was a hostess for six years. When there is a wait the first thing you tell the patron is the wait estimate and then you offer to put their names on a guest list. This is fundamental and was not communicated to us. You cannot blame a patron for getting upset when we asked for this information several times and were just told "the restaurant is full."  First one star review I've ever written. Well deserved, Hash Kitchen.

Ugh. The note below is probably why your restaurants are always empty.  You did NOT understand the situation. You asked me no questions about why we were getting frustrated and did not give your hostess a chance to explain the situation to you. You merely interjected when he came up to the counter upset and then you dismissed us with zero apology. What kind of customer service is that? I might have expected that from a shift manager, which is what I thought you were based on your behavior, but never a restaurant owner.   What my boyfriend said to your hostess was "she didn't even offer to put our name down." Valid complaint. Was his tone the best? Probably not. But we expected basic service which you didn't deliver. You, Mrs. Restaurant owner, are the one to blame for not training your staff well. Your actions were ruder than both my boyfriends and your hostesses actions. Unacceptable.   We were willing to wait. Like I said, we were excited to come try out your restaurant, but we were not even given the opportunity to wait. Where was the wait time? Neither you nor your hostess gave me that until I had to ask several times.   The fact that you had two similar instances within the matter of a few days should tell you that there is a problem with your service. Larry probably wanted to wait as well but was not given a chance. Service complaints are so easily rectifiable. Your hostess has had three similar complaints on here in the last two weeks. Train your staff.  Finally, way to go and get your friend, Yvonne, to write a review about your restaurant to counter mine. Very professional. Just like your response. Zero friends, two reviews, the other one for your failed restaurant, Cuttlefish? Nice try.  People - don't waste your time here. You can get a better Bloody Mary cart at The Henry. A better breakfast at Butterfields. And better service anywhere else. This plaza for example: Soi 4, Chez Vous Crepe, POMO, Naya... hell, I will even go to Pei Wei. You're in a spot with a lot of competition, lady. Step it up.   Again. One star, well deserved.

I'm always very skeptical of 5-star reputations on Yelp, but oh Yelpers, you are rarely wrong.   We ordered two pizzas to go, which I really don't recommend for artisan pizza. The crust gets soggy. But boyfriend doesn't like eating in public. So, you know, we compromise.  Anyway, highly recommend the spicy snag. Remember those tombstone pizzas your dad used to make when mom was out with the girls? It's like the grown up version of that. Fancy sausage. Spicy, with a hint of sweetness. The fresh chile adds a nice contrast in texture. Sad to admit I ate the leftovers for breakfast (no cheat days here).

Came here for lunch with a friend the other day.  Their menu is HUGE and has a lot of great lunch specials.  I opted for the sushi because I didn't want a food coma.  Overall, very underwhelmed.  Yes, the sashimi pieces are big but the fish is clearly not high quality.  It looks like it's been sitting out in the air for too long.  The sushi rice was also warm and mushy.  Gross...  I think I'll come again and try their Korean food, because that's what the other tables were all ordering.  Their bimbimbap did look really good!

Sooooo... last weekend I came here for brunch on Saturday AND Sunday.  Not ashamed - here's why.  Eggs benes are phenomenal here.  Dat hollandaise sauce...?  Yummmm.  Some of the best I've had.  I love that you can mix and match things here, so I usually get two different benes.  My favorite two are the Benny Goodman and the Bella Bella Benny.  I usually HATE prosciutto with eggs benedicts because most restaurants cook the prosciutto, which makes it super salty.  This one has a great balance and the prosciutto is not overwhelming.  If you're into the southwestern breakfasts, the Chilaquiles and Chile Verde Bennies are great as well.  Also - make sure you get a pancake flight here.  Sweet breakfast not your thing?  Great.  It's not mine either.  But I still get the pancake flight here, because their pancakes are delicious.  Again - the balance of flavors is amazing.  I've done the fancy pancakes at Butters, Eggstasy, Over Easy, etc, and they always overload the pancake with so many toppings so it feels like you're eating dessert.  This is the Goldilocks of fancy pancakes - not too sweet, not overwhelmed with toppings, juuuuuust right.  There's a couple of locations in the valley, and I'm sure they are all good.  Just make sure you get there early, because it will get crowded really quickly!

Definitely worth a try so you can contribute to the poll of the year: Shake Shack or In-n-Out?!  TL;DR:  Better burgers at In-n-Out. Better fries at Shake Shack - don't you dare forget the cheese sauce.

This is such a bastardized version of a boba shop. Why do I have to order a beverage with a nonsensical name when all I want is milk tea? Ugh. Also, the boba was tasteless and soggy. Such a sad Asian.

I'm so excited to have another healthy lunch place nearby!  We went during opening weekend and everything was great.  I think the owner or manager was working the cash register and he gave us coupons for our next time back.  The bowls are really good; fish is fresh.  Try the Hawaiian tuna poke they have!  Their portion sizes are smaller than I expected, but the quality of ingredients is definitely there.

My boyfriend and I stalk the "hot and new" places on Yelp and found this lovely sandwich shop.  What a hidden gem!!  I haven't found a place with a REALLY good gourmet sandwich and I think Leoni's has filled that void.  I got the #4 and boyfriend got the #5.  Both sandwiches were amazing!  The meats were definitely high quality, the bread was to die for, and everything was proportioned really well.  The guy working the register even gave us samples of the onion focaccia, which we will likely come back for.  Great spot for lunch!  Can't wait to come again!
