Being from Southern California, the "scene" is so much fun. There are several clubs to go to and any night is a great time. That brings us to the Phoenix scene and The Cash.Oh wait, there is no scene for the ladies. Not going to bash them to hard, because it's the only consistent place that we have. Yes it caters to the Country music crowd, but they do play spurts of other music through out the weekend evenings.The mixed drinks could be better, but the prices are reasonable.

Yes, I went to the Zoo in 100+deg weather.You know what? It wasn't all that bad. I took my little buddy there in the Morning. The park is very well shaded and there were several mister zones. We were able to see several of the animals get their breakfast. There were very few people at the park so I got to let my little buddy run free for a bit. We went to the petting Zoo and the goats got lots of toddler attention. Once it got a little warm out, we went to two water/splash pads zones. The first one the Leapin' Lagoon is more open and more suited for older kids. The Yakulla Caverns is great for the little ones. It is better shaded and has a small moat which is perfect for sitting a splashing in. I recommend going with your toddler into the caverns. Can't wait to go again!

How can you not like Costco. Try going around noon on the weekends. At that time, there are so many samples to try you wont even need lunch. Beware of buying stuff you do not need. It's so easy to say, "WOW, that's a great deal," (in the cart). Fortunately Costco has a fantastic return policy, better then any around.

Great shop!  All the current editions are very well organized and in alphabetical order. You really can get lost there and time can just fly by. The also have a plethora of back editions. Not as organized with that stuff, but if you have time to swift through the boxes, I bet you can find a few gems. The staff was not as knowledgeable with a few of the questions I asked, but tried their best to help me.They also have other comic related merchandise like stickers, T-shirts, cups, and a few action figures.

I came here yesterday with my buddy K (17 months) and I must say it have definitely improved. I hadn't been here in maybe a year. Back then it was just ok and something/someplace to take kids when it got super hot. I believe there are new owner and the improvements are noticeable and appreciated. There is no longer a center "cage" for the under 2's, but a nice little space off to the side. It opens up the space for lots of running around and using the riding toys. There is a lot more seating for the grown ups. There is new carpet and a way cool slide. Downsides, It's still a small place, they have raised the admission price to $9/kid, and I didn't see a discount if you have more then one child.

I must say I was a little nervous going to this place. First, I am a female getting and second I was concerned about the neighborhood. Once I got over that, I will not go anywhere else. I have been back 2 additional times since.  The neighborhood is not at all bad either. You must know that you will be waiting a while to get in the chair.A least 30 min, so be prepared. Once you are seen, the barber takes his time to get it perfect. I have a unique hairstyle, kind of an alternative dreadlock Mohawk, with the sides shaved. The barber used clippers, then did this lovely hot towel soothing thing,  then combed it to see how my hair laid down, then edged it up. The prices are very reasonable too.

I have been taking the kids I Nanny here almost every week for over 3 years. All the Coaches and other employees are very friendly and genuinely enjoy working with children. They also seem to retain coaches for long time. Which is very important for little kids to be comfortable and familiar with their Coach. My "kids" like going and even practice what they learn on their own in any body of water. The changing area is spacious and always clean. There are several wall hair dryers and they provide lotion and hair detangler complimentary. There is also a small playroom that  has a few toys, books, and a small lego table. During the summer it can get kinda crowded, but after that it's very mellow. There is a snack bar that offers a selection of items that most children would be very satisfied with. The also have candy on very low shelves. Not a fan of that, but not a problem for children who understand "No." Overall, great place, friendly staff, and nice amenities.

The Manager at this location is AWESOME! I think her name is Diana. I took my almost two year old buddy K here to get a a trim. He was NOT happy about being in the barber chair. Diana was very patient with him, cause it took us a long time to get comfortable. She made a few suggestions was was able to work her magic and trim his hair while he cried the whole time. He ended up with a very nice and even haircut. I can't say enough about how great this place is for little kids. Another tip, if you are a walk in there might be a bit of a wait. You can make an appointment as well.

Great Pharmacy!! They are one of the few that do compounds. You also never have to wait long to get your Rx filled. The staff is most friendly, quick, and efficent. The only issue is the parking lot.  It is usually full, but there is parking available on the street.

During the week, the staff is always super friendly & helpful. It's always very clean too. For a standard wash it will cost $1.25/load and $0.25 for 8min of dry time. There is also a place next door to grab a quick drink & chill at the bar while you wait for your laundry. I think that's an added bonus.

If you are looking for an new Optometrist or need new glasses, please check this place out. The entire staff is very friendly, professional, and helpful. There is an small yet perfect selection of frames, so it does not feel like a glasses factory. I care about the Earth and this place is one of the few in the area that carry eco-friendly frames from Eco and Drift. I highly recommend the establishment and will go no other place for my eye care. Thank you to all the staff at Eyecare Plus. Keep up the great work!

This is actually a Shell gas station with a CircleK convenience store. I like this Gas station because it's never crowded, has a lot of pumps, and it's convenient to get to. The Market is always clean and has a fairly good beverage/coffee station.

I recently checked out Oregano's at it's new location. I am so thrilled that this new space is much more spacious that the previous location. I came here for Lunch during the week and as always there was a slight wait. The wait wasn't that long, but as you wait they offer you free samples of pizza. As you walk through the Restaurant, pretty much every employee greets you. It doesn't seem cheezy either. It made my feel happy to  be greeted so nicely. Needless to say, the staff was fantastic and service was prompt and efficient. If you order a fountain type beverage, you get what looks like a 32 oz cup. I seriously needed two hands to drink from it and never needed a refill. For eats, we ordered the large dinner Salad and the BBQ Chicken Pizza on Whole Wheat Thin Crust. The Salad- pretty basic but adequate. The Pizza- Was disappointed in the whole wheat crust. I know it's hard to get right and they haven't got there quite yet.  The crust was too crispy and sometimes burnt in places. Besides that, the Pizza was still enjoyable. It had the right portions of everything.  Look forward to returning again.

I'm now a Boba addict! When I came her for the first time I was kind of a deer in headlights with all the options. The place was also very busy. The girl that took our order was very patient and calmly answered all my questions. I played it safe and ordered the Thai Tea Boba Slush. It can fairly fast and was SUPER delicious! I cannot wait to be more adventurous and try some other flavors.

Checked this out last week for the Friday Walkers class. I was very impressed. The woman who instructed the class was very calm, sweet, and patient. My little guy was not super impressed, due to it being around nap time. However, when she brought out the bubbles,he was all in.  The Library itself has a nice layout and is very neat. The location is cool, because it seems like it's a secret library hidden in the desert. The children's area (thought small) is functional and clean as well.

How can you say a bad thing about this place? Went here to satisfy a burger craving the other night and they are the only place that gets my crazy order correct. I usually get a DoubleDouble with cheese, Animal & Protein Style, extra Onions. The drive thru is usually long, but moves at a good pace. Tip: If you are going to go through the drive-thru and stop by the tree on the left with all the birdies happily chirping their beaks off, ROLL UP your windows  cause they gifts of their own to share.

Came here to check out some bikes, but end up buying them. Wyatt is very knowledgeable, patient, & friendly. Omar was very helpful & informative as well. They told us everything we needed to know and then some. They both took the time to help up install bike rack, properly place, & secure everything. Overall, excellent customer service. I know you can get cheaper prices elsewhere, but the overall service far outweighs cost.

The only reason why I go to Circle K's is for the Soda Fountain (Polar Pop) station, so that is the focus of my review.   This Circle K is the gold standard for it's Polar Pop station. There are lots of options to suite even the pickiest person (me). I made me happy to see they had several caffeine free choices, two kinds of ice, I think there were over 6 different ICEE choices, and 6 different flavor additions. Everything was full and in working order and clean. My selection of the day was crushed ice, Caffeine-free Cola, lemonade, a bit of raspberry ice-tea, with lime and vanilla syrup, and a B-12 boost. It was pretty good, but a little on the sweet side. I feel like a made soda scientist. Can't wait to go back to see what concoction I can come of with next.

Always friendly. Really enjoy the waiting area. They always have some type of special deal during the week. Check  out their website to see those deals. I alway like the Early Bird special on Saturdays before 9am. I will mention, sometimes they miss things so go over your vehicle before you leave to make sure your car is the way you like it. I have a dog and I always have to ask them to vacuum a litte better.

I came here unexpectedly for my birthday dinner. I was plesantly surprised. We had the table side guacamole, the scallops, Pollo a la Brasa, and the fish tacos. All outstanding! For dessert the brought out bread pudding. It was so flipping yummy I could have bathed in it. Will go back to try everything else.

I am fortunate enough to live near a Dutch Bros. This is both good and bad. Whenever I  need a super delicious coffee concoction,  DB's always hits the spot. It is not a cheap cup of coffee,  but worth it.  My usual order is a hot Kicker. The Kicker is a blend of their perfectly roasted coffee and Irish Cream. Yum! I will point out that their drive thru line is usually pretty long. Do not let this deter you. The line moves very fast and there is usually a really friendly employee moving from car to car taking orders. Don't  forget to get your stamp card too. After 10 stamps, you get any beverage free. They are also very generous with the stamps too.

Went here on Labor day during their Happy hour special. Great specials! I had an 18oz Blue Moon that looked like a small fish bowl. The bruschetta was ok, ahi tuna so..so, but the burger was delicious. The service was friendly, prompt, and didn't push us to try this or that, order more, or leave. Look forward to coming back again.

Look for a good honest place to get an oil change? Look no further! I'm always leery of trying out new oil change stations. I've had terribly bad experiences at other places that rhythm with iffy tube and yep toys.  Not this place. It's fast and friendly. The lady at the counter was really knowledgeable, help me choose the best service for my vehicle, and I didn't feel like I was being ripped off. I shall be a regular.

I love this place! If you haven't been to Culinary Dropout yet, What are you waiting for? I am a repeat offender of this joint and have had almost everything on the menu. The space is well designed and decorated, but it's pretty dark inside. It's also a nice touch with the open kitchen. There is one chef with an amazingly fierce Mo'hawk. On my most recent visit, I had the Fried Chicken. Not really a fried chicken fan, but it was delicious. It was basically half a Chicken accompanied with buttermilk biscuits. Now let's talk drinks. There are some pretty creative drinks on the menu.My favorite is Whiskey based Smashed Irishman. Some days of the weeks this place can get really loud from the live bands they feature.

I take some little one's to the KinderGym there and it is a great program. The layout of the gym is great as well as the Parent viewing zones. I must say, in the upstairs viewing space and the actual gym, it is super cold. They also have a very large boys program which is nice to see.

The MIM is fantastic!!! My advice is give yourself plenty of time to see everything or plan to come back. I was there for four hours and wasn't able to get to like 2/3's of the exhibits. There is soo much to see and do and you have to fight the urge to touch some of the exhibits on display. Don't worry, there is an area where you can actually play the instruments. If you are parched and need sustenance, the Cafe is top notch. I had a hamburger there and I swear it was the best burger I have had for quite while (and I love burgers). I cannot wait to return and see the sections I missed and to catch some of the visiting artist. I also would not recommend this place if you have kids under maybe 7ish. Many of the areas require you to use headphones to listen to the exhibit and to be patient with the listening device.

I was super looking forward to trying this place out. I have heard great things. When me and 3 others went at 4pm for a treat on a hot day, practically every ice cream bin was empty. My friend ordered her I cream and the server was trying to scoop half melted Ice Cream in a cup. He wasn't even willing to open the fresh and frozen ice cream at the bottom of the freezer. Needless to say none of us ordered anything. Very disappointed.

I usually see the bright side of any situation, but for my experience here a 2-star review is generous and it is mostly because of the food. I came here on 08/24 at around 4:30 pm. We came specifically to this restaurant for two reasons, we had a gift certificate/coupon, and we were attending the Cardinals game at 7 pm. We intended to sit, relax, pace our eats, and drink until the game. At the time we were seated, there wasn't any wait, and there were only two tables full in the area we were sat. We looked online before we came and they had a lot of good looking choices. We we were seated, we were given a one page (front/back) Special Event menu. On this special menu, there wasn't that many options, but we thought whatever and we were hungry. Our thoughts were if the menu is smaller everything should be done correctly, wrong so wrong.  For appetizers we ordered Chips & Salsa, guacamole, and jalapeno poppers. Chips- Wouldn't call them chips. More like tostadas broken in half and sometimes thirds. Salsa- Not much flavor or spice and lacked salt Guacamole- tasted like avocados were previously frozen or was in a plastic container. It lacked salt and flavor. To improve it, we used our limes from our beverages, added salt, and the salsa we had at our table. Made it better, but not by much. Jalapeno poppers- Not what I expected. Was basically cream cheese, bacon, and diced jalapenos molded together and shaped like a jalapeno. Had good flavor and was possibly fried a little too long, but it had bacon in it, so how bad could it be. For our entrees we ordered the taco salad and the classic taco with refried beans. I did not taste the taco salad, but it was described as OK. I had the Classic taco plate with refried beans. As stated before, everything lacked salt. I can honestly say Taco Bell tacos and pintos & cheese are far more superior then what I ate at Calico Jack's. Now here is where the disappointment gets a little deeper. We went to pay for our bill and was told that we could NOT use our gift certificate on Special Events. Special Event? It's just a pre-season Cardinal game and being walking distance to the stadium (0.3 miles) should not be deemed a special event. I love the Cardinals, but it's no New Years celebration. Now we had to pay around $75.00 for a below standard meal when we could have gladly paid that and more at the Yard House which was nearby. Being irritated by this, my wife asked to speak to the manager to show us where it stated this on our gift certificate (really couldn't/didn't explain it well), but told us that on game days it's considered a special event, and that the menu it scaled back to items that can be cooked/prepared quickly, and that their corporate office decides when the special events are. So basically they are being lazy and greedy to quickly turn over tables.We said when we came in to the establishment, there wasn't that many people in the restaurant. We also mentioned that the food was not at all that good and he said he couldn't control what came out of the kitchen.  Is it fair or right for them to claim around 125 events from steps away Jobing .com Arena and over 110 events at University of Phoenix Stadium as special events? Needless to say, I will not be returning to this place even if it were free. If you do, just go for the drinks, because those were very good, well made, and not watered down. Our waitress was very good and pleasant as well as all the other table staff.

When here to celebrate my birthday and it happened to be the night of Hot Flash dance. The club is nicely set  decorated with lots of seating options and the drinks were great and fairly priced. Other then that, the patrons were NOT easy on the eyes. There was also a plumbing issue because the place smelled like a fart box. I wish I got my $10 cover charge back as well as the 3 hours a spent there.

Artie service is above and beyond what you can find in the area. He saved us on a Sunday evening from a busted kitchen pipe and didn't even charge us extra for it being Sunday. He was super professional, very tidy, and integrous. I would recommend no other.

If you want to Cloth Diaper your baby, this should be your first stop. They offer free Cloth Diaper classes a few times a month that are VERY informative. The owner Shira teaches the class and it was so refreshing because she educated us  about all the different ways you could diaper and did not try to sell us products the whole time. They also has other great products for Mom and baby. Besides diapering items,  I have  purchased a Baltic Amber Teething necklace, toys, and a herbal teething oil. Support local and stop here before going to those other big box baby stores.

This is a cute little farm only quick 20 minutes from my home. We came here to go to the Pumpkin Patch and see the Farm animals with my 7 month old. This is a great place  this time of year for the 5 and under crowd. It's not fancy and doesn't have a ton of activities like some other larger farms, but its a perfect spot to spend a few hours. The farm fee is $3/adult and $10/ child over 2 years old. The child's admission includes a small pumpkin, stickers for pumpkin decorating, a small maze, hay rides, and two bounce houses. There are a couple of shaded picnic/sitting area, assorted farm animals (chickens, goats, sheep, pigs, donkeys, cows, and horses), and a concession stand.  You can purchase carrots to feed the goats and sheep. You can tell they are used to being fed by people, cause when you approach them, the ALL come to the fence trying to lick your hands. There is a shop you can go to with out paying any admission. It has seasonal goods, homemade jams and salsas, fresh eggs, and fruits. I am looking forward to returning next year when my baby will be able to fully enjoy all it has to offer.

Went here yesterday to drop of a few computer. There is a blue bin to the left of the parking lot where you can deposit your electronic goods in. Most items are free, but I think T.V.'s.  It's an awesome service, but very challenging to find. If you are unfamiliar with the area you might catch yourself driving in circles. When I called to figure out how to find the place, the guy said they are right across the street from a billboard sign (currently a Jack in the Box ad).

Dined here on Thursday evening. It was very loud due to a band playing out front. We had the falafel as an appetizer, which was average, & not too flavorful. CAPICOLA HAM & HERB TOMATO FLATBREAD & the PEAR and GORGONZOLA FLATBREAD. Those were simple and exciting to the taste buds. For dessert, we  had the Expresso chocolate martini. It was yummy!

I had my SUV tinted today and it turned out AWESOME! My car already feels so much cooler. Shannon and Kip were super professional and very knowledgeable about their product. Their tint even comes with a Lifetime warranty. Price was super affordable, honest, and it took less time then I expected. The price I was actually quoted was exactly what I paid. Shocking!   Stop calling around and getting quotes from other places. Call the Mobile Tint Team and make your appointment today you will not be disappointed.

Was here on a Friday night. It was a default restaurant, because the one I wanted to go to was no longer there. This place was packed and was an hour long wait. I grumbled and whined, because I thought it was going to be like the Olive Garden. Boy was i wrong! The service was awesome. While the crowd waited, they passed out pizza samples and made sure everyone that wanted one got one. Once seated our server Clint (shout out to Clint!) was the best waiter I have ever encountered. Even though the restaurant was packed, he sat down to explain all the good things to order. We ended getting a small greek salad, Half Mama spinato & The Combo pizza, and a small cheese pizza. Everything was delicious. Shockingly, the stand out was the Cheese pizza. Will definitley be back to this place. Don't let the long wait scare you away. It's worth it.

This place is kind of challenging to find. It is in the corner of the shopping plaza behind the Dunkin' Donuts and to the right of Pig & Pickle. I came in to resize a watch. Service was very friendly & fast. You have to be buzzed in from a super heavy duty gate. I explained how I wanted it to fit and before I even had a chance to find a good magazine, it was done. From now on, this is my go to spot for anything watch and jewelry related.

Was on a bike ride around Tempe Town Lake with friends and saw this was the closest Breakfast spot. I didn't expect much from this place, but I was blown away. The restaurant is arranged nicely and open. It even has a bar and we ordered yummy Bloody Mary's. It is a nice casual atmosphere and service was prompt. I didn't really try any of the food, but friends ordered breakfast burrito and an some kind of omelet. There were no complaints. Cannot wait to go to this place again.

Who wouldn't want to go to a place called Bubbles! Great spot for all your self Car Wash needs.The property is well taken care of and in a nice location if you need a quick evening was too.  Every time I go, there is never a wait and I can get my washing done and be on my way. It's nice that if you do not have cash, there is a vending machine that takes Visa/MC for you to purchase car wash tokens.

This is a great location. It's kind hidden and there is not a lot of wait time. I was in and out in 15 minutes. It's so fast once you get in the testing zone, they were done and I was like "that'sit!" By the way, I have a Hybrid car and thought is was bogus the MVD made me get emissions this year.

I always fret over the thought of having to get my car serviced. It really is not one of my favorite activities. I make sure I have all my supplies just in case I'm there forever.  Chapman Ford is doing their best to make getting your car serviced simple. I was able to make my appointment online. The waiting room is more like a lounge. You can help yourself to coffee, water, or various complimentary snacks. Even the QuickLube area has comfortable seating and complimentary coffee and water.  If you need a ride back home or work they will give you a ride. The staff is attentive and helpful is letting me know what was going to be done to my vehicle. I didn't need much done, so I was there just under an hour. Next time I won't delay getting my car over there. I hope they keep up the good service.

My Wife and I hit the jackpot with a had new babysitter. We wanted to go see a movie and have dinner, but not be out for hours. Studio Movie Grill combines the two AND they have a full bar. Aaaahaa, sold already! We had some strong drinks for happy hour at the bar before our movie started. Since we had reserved our seats, its was nice to not have to rush into the theatre to secure a good shop spot. I will also mentioned that we were there on a Monday and got extra special care because there weren't a lot of traffic. The food we ordered was plentiful, delicious, and perfect for movie watching. The theatre chairs were comfortable, but wish they reclined. If we are luck enough to get a sitter again, you know where you'll find us.

Great addition to the neighborhood! Since I discovered this place, I have been at least 4 times. The space is very  big yet cozy. It has an area for whatever mood your in. There is the main dining area, the bar section, the front patio, and the super cool big back patio. The back patio is lots of fun, but only open during the weekend. You can even bring your dog. I have tried several food items and all were very tasty. Of course, there is the beer. Too many to comment on, but the staff is very knowledgeable about the beer, and are very patient with helping you choose something new. Keep this place alive and go as often as possible.

I occasionally indulge my sugar cravings with a super giant Polar Pop Slushie. Therefore I am a fan of Circle K. To me an awesome Circle K has at least 6 slush flavor options to choose from and at least 2 caffine free options. From the outside and odd location, this place doesn't look like much. However, it surprised my by being so clean and very well organized. The soda fountain area had tons of choices and was spotless. The two employees there at the time seemed happy to be there and were friendly too. Since it is a bit colder now, I will have to return to check out their coffee/cocoa station.

This is one of my Wife's favorite fast food places. I always forgot about it, but every time we go I say "dang this is good stuff." The Chicken fingers are very substantial and really should be called Chicken forearms. Our family (wife+baby), usually orders The Caniac Club with extra Texas Toast and share it. The 6 giant chicken fingers, fries, Cole slaw, and toast is plenty enough food for us. The signature dipping sauce is very tasty too.

I attended the event on Sunday. I was very disappointed in this event. I was looking forward to being able to sample and introduced myself to new foods. Sadly this wasn't the case. I thought the event was too spaced out, you had to pay admission, and then you had to pay for sample size items that were overpriced, and the chef demo zone was poorly setup. The food items I got were ok, but nothing to Food Truck Stalk over.There is room for improvement, but I am hesitant to go to another one of these events. When I checked into the event , I got an offer for Yelp items and to go check out their booth, but Yelp wasn't even there (so sad).

El Dorado  Park has something  for everyone. It's a fun neighborhood park with plenty of green space. There are several shaded picnic spots, skate park, golf course, frisbee golf, basketball course, and two playgrounds. The city just finished remodeling to smaller playground near the Recreation center and it is much better. The city is also improving the area and entry to the park between McDowell Rd and Thomas Rd. The walk/bike paths are always well maintained and  bustling with traffic. Sometimes you need to watch out for the geese monters cause they think they own the place.  If you need to fine tune your casting skills, there is a stocked lake near by, but you do need to have a fishing permit.

Gertrude's is a hidden gem. It is a very small restaurant inside, but if not too hot the patio has plenty of seating. We were there for some drinks and Bloody Mary Mussels. The Mussels were cooked perfectly and the added Bloody Mary sauce was slurp worthy. Looking forward to returning and sampling other items from the menu.

Came here totally by accident, because the restaurant I wanted go to was closed. I am glad it was! My wife and I enjoyed the Regina Margherita and the Pomo pizza. They were both were ready very quicky, cooked perfectly, and super delicious.  We also received complimentary creamy limoncello shots and powdered sugar crispy chips  for dessert. This place is defintely going to give the Pizza Hut across the street some competition.

I am surprised that I just found out about this place. I just typed "chocolate" in my yelp search and then this place popped up. This small shop was spotless,  but the beautifully and perfectly arranged chocolates immediately captured my attention. Our chocolate concierge was very informative and patient. She answered all our questions and explained how each was handmade in Belgium. They are a little on the pricy side and at first we were going to get 2 each. However,  they are so beautiful we had to each get 4.  The box of 8 chocolates was $28. It was worth it! I was not disappointed by any of my choices. I hope (hint,hint) that I'll get some Valentines yummies here instead of that other place with the "S" in its name.

I had the chance to enjoy their Happy Hour last Saturday. Since they just opened they were pretty empty, but I feel with the quality of food they serve that will not last for long.  We ate the spring rolls, salmon sushi, the Las Vegas Roll, and the assorted sashimi. The all the items we delicious and fresh. I was very impressed by the size of the roll and it wasn't overly cream cheesy. Cannot wait to come back to try more items.

I have been waiting for a long time to come to Bahama Bucks. I was finally in the area and it did not disappoint. I have had shaved ice from the motherland and this is pretty close to Hawaiian Shaved Ice. I must say, the menu is slightly chaotic. I took me awhile to figure out that they offer more then just shaved ice. There is also a ton of flavor choices. I appreciated the fact that they had some suggested flavor combos. I was behind a family sampling almost every flavor, so I had a lot of time to figure out what I wanted to order. I could tell that the employees are used to people sampling a ton and they were all patient. Once I got my order, it was the perfect ratio of syrup to ice. My toddler who does not like cold things or sweets, loved the shaved ice at Bahama Bucks. As the weather starts to warm up, I can see myself finding a way to be in the neighborhood.

I had to go back and give this place another try. It is the closest tea focused café to ASU. This time I got more of explanation of the menu. I choose to create my own custom tea smoothie. There are several flavor options on the side and you can get crazy. My flavor choices were Matcha, honey, and ginger with added Boba. It was made perfectly and was super delicious! I will definitely be a regular here.

I am going to start with a WOW!!! I was completely blown away with this Restaurant. I am not easy to please. That being said, let's get to the food. My family tried several dishes; the Shishito Peppers, Chile Crab Garlic Noodles, Crispy Calamari, Shishito Roll, Maya Roll, and the Chilean Sea Bass.  Everything was prepared and/or cooked perfectly. The two things that stood out was the Calamari and the Sea Bass. The game changer for the Calamari was the sauce and the salad it sat on top of. I could have that everyday. The Sea Bass was cooked to perfection. I've eaten fish at a lot of Restaurants and this is the best I have ever tasted. My only complaint is that I wish there was more of it. There was only two small skewers with two cubes of fish on each. They also use REAL crab in all their dishes, even the sushi rolls. Besides the food, the decor itself is very fun and bright and suites its theme. My family was there with my 4 month old around 5:30pm on a Saturday. Already at that time the places was hoppin'. I recommend making reservations.  The wait staff was very accommodating and super friendly. We and sat on the patio and we were glad because the inside was very loud and a little cramp. The patio is very nice and misters are very good. If you do bring a baby, they do have highchairs, but no place to change a diaper in the restroom.Other then that minuscule detail, I can't wait to try more items on the menu.

My first time dining at the Shack and I am already hooked and slightly addicted to it. Since is was our first visit, our server Dion took extra time to go over the WHOLE menu, explain all our options, and answer all our questions. Our table started off with fresh raw oysters that came in a platter over ice and tasted as if they were scooped out of the ocean. I ordered King Crab with the Trifecta sauce at a spice level 2. Now I like things super spicy hot, and a level 2 spice definitely kick back. My wife had crab in a lemon pepper sauce with a level 0 spice and that was very good too. All the people in our party were pretty silent, just heads down, enjoying the deliciousness of our Cajun boiled seafood. I've been to lots of fine dinning restaurants, but I must say the service was outstanding. Dion kept all the beverages full, replenished napkins, and removed finished items without us even asking. The restaurant was packed too, so extra skills points. If you look around all the staff seemed to enjoy being there and it showed. I SO,,,can't wait to come here again. If you do go, bring a marker so you can write your name/message on the walls.

This place is GREAT!!!! I was a fan of the Scottsdale location so my expectations were really high. This Tempe location is definitely on par. The space is very spacious and beautiful warehouse chic. It is kinda dark in the evening, but has romantic lighting. Now on to the food parts! Our table ordered an assortment of appetizers. The Pork Belly Nachos (more please), the Parmesan Brussel sprouts (yes!), some charcuterie (cheese & meats oh my!). My main entree was the ramen. Very good!! The service was excellent. I had my 9 month old with me, and the servers were very attentive and friendly with her and brought our her food right away. Even though I live closer to the Scottsdale location, I can't wait to return to this one very soon. The only thing that need improving is the parking situation, but in time I am sure it will be less confusing.

I am sold! I am closer to the Arcadia location, but THIS location is AWESOME. The wife, the toddler, and I dined here on a impromptu weeknight. We choose to sit outside, which really does not feel like you are actually outside. I really love the u-shape high top booths, because my toddler can walk about while being contained. Now let's talk food. We enjoyed the Pretzel Board as an appetizer, the AZ Burger, and the Portobello Sandwich. Everything was prepared perfectly and was very delicious. I was really surprised by the Portobello Sandwich, it was fabulous I wanted more, but it was not mine to devour. The onion straws on the AZ burger are something to battle over. I could have eaten a whole plate of them. We ordered the Mac 'n cheese on the kids menu for the little one and it was the only thing that was disappointing. It's pretty much Kraft mac'n cheese and could be upgraded a lil bit. The service was great too and never even noticed them, but all my beverages were never empty. I can't wait to come back and enjoy the outdoor patio and all the other bonus features.

I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this place. Two stars is being kind. The location has been empty for year and as a Pho aficionado, I was so supper excited to see this place opening in my neighborhood. I do understand that during my visit, they were still trying to work out some kinks, which is always to be expected of new restaurants. However, it was way unorganized. When I walked in you immediately see a large bar right in front of you (which is where all the employees seemed to be). There was no hostess in the hostess area, so I just went to the bar. I wanted to order food to go and let a server know this. I sat for 20 min before even getting a menu, waited another 10 min for someone to take my order, and another 20 min for my actual food. Meanwhile I sat at the bar while an employees complained loudly amongst themselves about all the work they had to do that day. I stayed because I hoped the food would make up for it all. The answer is, it did not. I  ordered House Pho, dumplings, egg rolls, and fried rice. All the non soup items were very greasy and lacked seasoning. The pho too was under seasoned and my noodles were gummy.  I might give this place another shot an a few more months and a few more reviews to allow them some time to get things going.

I am so thrilled that a gourmet Donut shop has finally landed in my 'hood. This location has been reincarnated several times and I truly hope this one stay around for some time. It's in an unfortunately neglected shopping plaza, but don't let that keep you away. The shop is clean, modern, and simple. On your left you will find an uncomplicated menu board directly above a bright case of fancy beautiful donuts. The most challenging task is choosing what to try. My toddler helped me out and chose all of them. Ha! A friend of mine recommend the Red Velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. I choose a Blueberry Old Fashioned and a Chocolate Crumb cake. I got a Sprinkled one for the Tot. The cake donuts were moist and not overly sweet. The Red Velvet did not disappoint and was my favorite of my selection. I found the Blueberry one very good, but slightly too sweet for my tastes after my bites of the cake ones. I would get it again to try on its own. Some of the other donuts on display that I have to come back and try were a Vanilla Bean cronut, PB&J, Oreo, Maple Bacon, Apple pie, and Peach pie.
