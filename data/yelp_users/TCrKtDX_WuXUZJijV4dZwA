This is the original, long standing Red Devil restaurant that has been in this location for many decades. When you walk in, you'll notice even the decor hasn't changed. This is affordable, Italian comfort food at its best. They also happen to make the best hot wings! (The pizza is not bad, either).  For some reason, their 'medium' hot wing sauce is a mixture of hot sauce and BBQ sauce. I think its disgusting. But the mild and hot are normal. However, for me the mild is just too mild and the hot is just too hot. Well, they also offer a 'New York Mild' which isn't quite medium, but is very flavorful with a hint of hot.  I recommend ordering the wings crispy, New York mild. Soooooo good!  I wish they would serve celery with the wings and I wish they served Coke instead of Pepsi. Those are my only complaints...  The staff is always friendly, there is never a long wait to receive your food after ordering and its not too difficult to get a table on a typical busy Phoenix Friday or Saturday night. And did I mention how affordable it is?   10 wings = $7.99 1 soda = $2.49 1 Small Garden Salad: $3.59  Of course they have manicotti, ravioli, speghetti, etc... Lot's of Italian comfort food to choose from on the menu. This is my favorite place for wings!

My wife and I tried this place out for an early Valentine's dinner to avoid the crowds. We were very pleasantly surprised.  Our waiter, Santino, is an older gentlemen with a nice, thick Italian accent. It's clear he is very experienced with serving, the details of each dish and the daily specials. He was excellent and, as politically incorrect as it may be, having an Italian-accented server really adds to the atmosphere of this authentic Italian restaurant (even if it is owned by a Greek.) Basically, what I'm saying is, if Santino was working at McDonald's, I would eat at McDonald's more often. :)  The food was excellent and each dish came out in a timely manner. We arrived on a Wednesday night and parking was easy, no reservations and we were seated immediately. The restaurant was respectfully busy on a random Wednesday night, so that tell's you something. People obviously like it!  We started with drinks. I had a Coke, my wife an iced tea. They have a fine wine menu with plenty of choices available as well, of course.  They brought a basket with a small loaf of bread (similar to French bread) with a ramekin with about four pats of real butter.   We ordered the fried mozzarella, which arrived not as sticks as you might expect. Instead, there were two triangles (shaped like Arby's potato cakes) put together to form a square and a generous portion of a heavy marinara was on top. I found the marinara a bit strong, but nothing I couldn't scrape away with a fork. I like that it was different, but still good.  My wife ordered the chicken Florentine while I opted for the Angel Hair Pomodore. In fact, trying to find a restaurant in town that served Angel Hair was quite difficult and it was my Google research that landed us here. You'd think Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, Bucca Di Beppo, and other popular Italian chains would offer it, but sadly, no.  Each meal includes a soup and a salad. We were told when we sat down what the soup was, but there was no mention of the salad or any choices to be made. I guess you get what you get as far as type of salad and dressing. I don't eat soup or salad (I'm a fussy eater) but my wife seemed to enjoy it.  The Angel Hair Pomodore was done right! Old school, no tomato sauce, just real chunks of stewed tomatoes tossed with olive oil, basil and garlic. Often times I find pasta sauces (and pizza sauces) far too sweet. Not a problem here. It was almost bitter. I loved it!  My wife enjoyed her chicken Florentine, though the broccoli, cauliflower and carrots were a bit crunchy for being steamed. A minor issue, really.  The person who refilled our drinks must have visited our table a half-dozen times to top off our glasses of water and my wife's iced tea. He also refilled my Coke for me (which has to be done at the bar.)  I worry that giving this place 5 stars may set unrealistic expectations if you've never dined here before. I know the rating is important to the restaurant, but so many things can change during a dining experience. Think of this place as a 4 star and hopefully it will exceed your expectations (if that makes sense.)  We'll definitely be back!  Iced tea: $2.50 Coke: $2.50 Fried Mozz: $6.95 Chicken Florentine: $15.95 Angel Hair Pomodore: $12.95  Tax: $3.39 Total: $44.24  (service from Santino: $ Priceless!)  That's a bargain for this kind of food in this kind of atmosphere with this kind of service!

This place is a hidden gem! It's been in AZ since 1980 and I only learned of it within the last few years. It's a combination of italian deli and sit-down restaurant. Surprisingly, the pizza wasn't very good, but they offer broasted chicken and broasted fish with broasted potato wedges or broasted fries and it is amazingly and consistently delicious. We drive from Glendale to eat here and then drive back home - it is so worth it. We've had broasted chicken at other places but we've never seen anyone else offer broasted fish. It's like thick nuggets of cod in a light batter and it is so good (comes with coleslaw, chicken meal comes with salad or coleslaw).  They serve you hot garlic bread in a basket that is often made from Italian bread, French bread and even a sesame French bread, baked on premises!  We've never had to wait to be seated and its one reason my wife and I do NOT like to go out to eat on a Friday or Saturday night in the Phoenix metropolitan area, where dine-in restaurants commonly have a  1-2 hour wait before getting a table (Grimaldi's, Texas Roadhouse, Applebees, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Cheesecake Factory, etc...etc...)  They also sell dry pastas, sauces and oils imported from Italy as well as offer a variety of fresh baked goods, I also like that I can pick up the latest copy of the free New Times newspaper there.  The pasta dishes are excellent. The only thing we've had they we were disappointed with is the pizza - which is kind of shocking, given how good everything else is and how authentically Italian it is otherwise.  Haven't tried anything from the deli. We go there primarily for the broasted fish and broasted chicken. You have to try both and decide which you like better (most people I take prefer the fish, but agree they are both great!).  Prices are very reasonable and lots of menu items to select from. And they serve Coke products. What more could I ask for?

I only need to go to Art's Parts about once every 3 or 4 years, and I always panic that they might have gone out of business since the last time I was there. They've moved locations over the last 20 years that I've been going here, and Art has passed on, however, the spirit of Art still exists in the employees there today. Not only can you get the motor you need for your air conditioner on a blistering hot August day in Phoenix, but you can even do it on a Sunday. $250 got me a new motor and capacitor for my central air, and they even told me how to install it! It's one thing I loved about Art. He wouldn't just sell you the part, but telling you how to install it for FREE? I never knew how to fix an A/C unit until I was told by all the A/C companies it would be three days before they could be out, the charge would likely be $500+ and who knows what else they might 'make up' in their diagnosis and I'd have to try to sleep in a hot house or go to a motel with my dogs at even more expense?! Took me 45 minutes. House is cooling back down now. Motel avoided. Wait for A/C company avoided. Money for motel saved. Money for labor saved. And I know the job was done right because I did it myself with pride! Even on a Sunday! Thank you AGAIN Arts Parts!

I have a Tissot watch, worth about $600 new. When the battery died, I quickly learned there is no way you can open the watch yourself and Tissot even warns against the customer opening the watch. I took the watch back to Jared, the jewelry store that sells them, and they said they could not replace the battery. They would have to ship the watch and within 3-to-6 weeks I would get it back. I was told they would replace the gasket and pressure test the watch. The cost would be $75!  So I went across the parking lot and into the mall and asked the kind folks at Fast Fix Jewelry and Repairs if they could replace the battery in my Tissot watch. Yes, they could. How long would it take? 20 minutes. How much would it cost? $60. Here's why - they charge $44.95 for the battery replacement with a one year warranty. They charge $10 to pressure test the watch and there is $5.06 in tax.  Done and done. You cannot even tell the watch was opened and they even pressure tested it. I have no idea why pressure testing is necessary, as this is a watch designed for car and motorcycle racing - it's NOT a diving watch. But whatever.  It should be obvious to the reader at this point that I highly recommend Fast Fix Jewelry and Watch Repairs and they'll be getting my business again!!!  THANK YOU FAST FIX JEWELRY AND WATCH REPAIRS (AND PEDRO!!!)

The Original Hamburger Works is an authentic, rustic Arizona treasure. I am going to address some of the negative reviews I read here within my review.  Firstly, if you're expecting fine dining and to be waited on hand-and-foot, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!. This is a classic, cowboy-style establishment. That means, apart from cooking the food, YOU do everything yourself, the way YOU like it. No one will get in your way or tell you that you're doing it wrong or that you don't fit in. This is not a fad, nor is it a corporate-owned, soulless entity that employs big breasted women and other shallow gimmicks to trick you into eating here.  The Original Hamburger Works has been in business since 1977 and has only stayed in business this long, in the same location, because it generates enough income on a sustainable and regular basis to justify its very existence since it opened more than 38 years ago! NOT because it has some rich financial or corporate investors. This is the real deal that proves it has passed the test of time that kills the vast majority of independent restaurants within the first few years.  I'm a very fussy eater, but I've never tasted anything here I didn't like. I have no idea how the fried foods (french fries, onion rings, breaded mushrooms, etc...) don't come out greasy. I have no idea how the hamburgers melt in your mouth, even plain, with nothing on them!  The ordering process is, again, cowboy-style. A style you likely won't find any place else. You walk up to the counter, located below the large menu mounted on the wall, and place your order with the cooks. They give you a printed copy of your order and then you walk to the cashier, just around the corner to the left. She looks at the printed order, rings it up and you pay her. She asks for your name and gives you cups for any sodas ordered.  Next, fill your sodas/tea/water however you like. After that, find a table and seat yourself. There are free peanuts (in the shell) and popcorn by the bar - help yourself.   Your name will be called out when your order is ready. This typically takes less than 15 minutes (in my experience). Your food is waiting for you by the cashier, on disposable plates, on a large silver platter. Bring the platter to your table, and when you're ready (and if you ordered a burger) take your burger to the burger-bar and top it with whatever you like, as much as you like, just the way you, and ONLY you, know how you like it.  Go back to your table, enjoy your meal and, when done, throw everything away except for plastic baskets and the silver platter. Set those above the garbage can.  This place is very down-to-earth. The prices are great and the food is terrific. The staff are busy working, so you often won't have much (or any) conversation with them apart from the ordering and paying process. If previous customers leave without cleaning up after themselves, they're the ignorant, inconsiderate, self-entitled jerks to blame, NOT the staff. However, the staff *WILL* clean the tables if they notice or you ask (whichever comes first). We've all been to fast food restaurants where slob, inconsiderate cretins pretending to be human beings, leave their mess for the others to clean up. Some 'people' are just inconsiderate pigs and shouldn't eat out at fast food restaurants where YOU ARE EXPECTED TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF! (Did I put enough emphasis on consideration?)  Half of the building is the restaurant and the other half a bar. Sit where you are most comfortable. Its interesting to note that the booths by the bar have salt and pepper shakers, but other booths in the restaurant do not. There are salt and pepper shakers at the burger bar. Once again, help yourself. Put it back where you found it when you're done.  When you understand the social contract involved with eating here, you'll realize how much you enjoy it is directly related to how much you WANT to enjoy it. The employees are not there to entertain you.   You should certainly feel safe while dining here as you'll often see Phoenix police officers dining here regularly.  I honestly believe if you choose to dine here with the right attitude and expectations, you'll enjoy it as much (or more) than my family does. We've never had a bad experience with the staff or the food in the 4-5 years we've been dining here - and if we did, we understand mistakes sometimes happen and would address those issues accordingly. These are human beings working here, not robots. Treat others as you would like others to treat you. I admit, we do not eat here often enough! It seems like every time we finish a meal here, I ask my wife why its been so long since we were last here. I only wish I had known about it 30 years ago!

Imagine you open a sports bar in 1980 and then don't change anything to 'keep up with the times.' 35 years later, they still have the same decor, they still serve many food items that other restaurants have long since stopped offering (potato skins come to mind) and it seems the only thing they've 'upgraded' are the prices (to keep up with costs) and added about 18 flat screen TVs. Other than that, it hasn't really changed. This is a biker bar, and when I was there, the crowd was made up mostly of older people, many of whom look like they were once (or still are) bikers.  This isn't a problem. Bikers are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Our waitress treated us like we were regulars and everything we ordered was good. Prices were fair and the food did not take long from ordering to serving. The bench seats used in the dining booths are very narrow. You get about 10 inches of seat for your bottom. That's it. So apart from feeling like I was sitting a booth designed for children, I really liked this place.  They also do this weird thing with the music that I also like. A song will come on and, when its over, its stays quiet for about 5 minutes before the next song plays. I like this because it can be hard to have a conversation at restaurants that have music constantly blaring. This music gave diners a break of silence between songs. I like this a lot and wish more places would exercise this practice. Its not a club, it's a restaurant!  I've read numerous stories about how rude the owner can be on display to his customers, though we did not experience any of that. Our entire dining experience was 'normal.'  This place is a bit of a dive, but its actually quite nice for a 35 year old biker bar. No issues with parking or finding the place. They also have a lot of menu items I want to try, from the burgers to the wings. I had the Philly steak sandwich and loved it.   Looking forward to dining here again real soon and enjoying my trip back to 80s when I'm there. Love it!  UPDATE:  Went back last night after reading the reviews here about how great the hot wings are. I ordered 6 mild wings, 6 medium wings and 6 hot wings. They were just .55 per wing and domestic beer was $2. Pretty cheap!  The wings do take a while to cook, but the wait is worth it. The mild has no heat at all, the mediums have a slight heat and the hot flavored wings have a medium heat to them. I didn't care for the smell of the hot sauce on the hot-flavored wings. I think I would order mediums in the future (and ask to make them crispy!)  The salads here that I've tried are also excellent!

This office is located inside of a gym called Fitness Works, so you cannot see the office or any indication of its existence unless you walk into the gym. You do NOT need a gym membership. Just enter the gym and let them know at the front desk you are there to see the chiropractor. Reservations are recommended, but not required. Walk-ins are welcome, but pay close attention the days and hours of operation, as they are a little funky.  I was exercising at the gym when my back unexpectedly went out on me. I couldn't move and actually went into shock. They grabbed the doctor (I'd say Dr. Haggard, but there are many Dr. Haggards. There are several generations of chiropractors in the Haggard family, though only one Dr. Haggard works at this location. To avoid confusion of the other Dr. Haggards, I'll just call him Dr. Justin.)  He started asking me some questions and eventually I was able to walk with his assistance into his office and he took some X-rays to determine the severity of my injury and whether not an ambulance was needed.  He has a state of the art X-ray machine that sends the images digitally to a computer hooked up to 40"-class big screen TV so you can see what he is seeing and he can interpret the X-rays to you.  I've never had an issue with my back before, so at 45 years old, all of this was a new experience for me. I could barely walk and felt like I aged 20 years in a split second.  Luckily for me, the X-rays didn't show anything that required a hospital visit and Dr. Justin recommended I see him for adjustments to speed my recovery.   We did that for a while and things got better, but my back was still sore. For at least two weeks I was not able to tie my own shoes without exceptional pain. Finding a comfortable position to sleep was also painful and frustrating.  Dr. Justin recommended something called a K-Laser combined with traction. He has all this new technology I've never seen before and didn't really appreciate what it did until I agreed to follow his suggestions for these treatments (even though I didn't fully understand what these treatments were.)  The traction tables are very cool. You lay flat on your back on a comfortable and modern-looking massage table. There are large velcro straps that he tightens around you and then he pushes some buttons and the table starts to vibrate and slowly make itself longer. The amount of pull is set by the doctor based on your size and weight, etc... The table also inclines, so the doctor will ask you if you are feeling any discomfort, and if you are, he adjusts the incline of the table and the discomfort magically goes away.  After the table, he used the K-laser on me. Not sure what this does or how. It's in a separate room and it gets very hot against your back and he moves it, pauses, moves it, pauses, etc... around the affected area. This is supposed to speed up the healing of the cells in the back (as I understand it).  He also had me using a stretching machine, which is a modern looking piece of exercise equipment that has you bending forward and back on a chair that rocks back and forth as you place your hands and feet in different positions for each type of stretch (which is detailed on the machine so you don't have to ask how to do the exercises - you can ask if you want to, but its all explained with diagrams on the machine itself.)  He also has several automated massage tables which were pure heaven when my back pain was severe. These tables are just amazing. You lay on one and you're going to want one for your house (until you find out how much they cost!)  He also has other traction equipment, not sure what its specifically called, but there are small weights attached to a rigging that go through a pulley system and  you place a strap behind your neck.  There is also a modern chiropractic table, where sections of the table drop from under you, usually unexpectedly, as he is 'cracking' your back.  The place can get pretty busy at times, but he or one of the employee's can assist you with an exercise or the massage table or whatever, while he tends to someone else. You do get one-on-one time with the doctor when necessary but, for the most part, he is constantly moving from one patient to the next, helping several people simultaneously.  Somehow, he seems to remember everyone's name and their ailment. He is also very friendly and has a lot of empathy. He also, as it turns out, is a very good chiropractor! I have waited until now to write this review so I can say with certainty if what he did helped or not. My injury occurred on 2-24-14 and today is 6-18-14. My back feels much better now, though I can (and will) benefit from future adjustments. But at least I can get back to work and have my life return mostly to normal. He showed me 'before and after' x-rays of my spine so I could see with my own eyes the effectiveness of the chiropractic care he was prescribing me and extinguish any skepticism I originally had.   Highly recommended!!!

Full price tickets with box office fees ($30 per ticket, plus $5 box office fee + $5.26 tax), $11 for two small glasses of Coke (that had more ice than Coke in the glass), NO DRINK PRICES ON THE MENU, a forced 15% gratuity for a party of two, tables that seat people with their backs to the stage with chairs closer together than a coach seat on Southwest Airlines, keeping the A/C down (in December!) at a temperature colder than I keep my refrigerator and punishing non-alcoholic drinkers by charging the same amount for a soda as you do an entire appetizer tray? Also, 'adult ketchup' is mentioned on the menu, yet our server never heard of it and couldn't explain it to us. What was the total cost for 90 minutes of this entertainment? $114.58. I've never experienced such passive-aggressive contempt for customers (and I'm a Jew that shops at Hobby Lobby!) Talk about 'funny business!'  I really miss Budd (the original founder). He never pulled stunts like this.

This is a tough review to write because we've been dining at this location for over 8 years and it has always been consistently inconsistent.  For example, I like to order the fish and chips. Years ago, Joe's used a fish called 'Hoki' to make their fish and chips. You would receive three fairly generous-sized portions of fish. I had never heard of Hoki before, but combined with the batter mixture they use, it was a great flavor I couldn't get anywhere else.  A couple years later, they replaced Hoki with Cod and the portions became smaller, so I stopped dining there as often. When I finally went back recently, they've once again replaced the fish in the fish and chips. Instead of Cod, now it's Pollock and the portions were generous again (still three pieces.)  Over the years we've had bad service, but good food. We've also experienced great service with bad food. And we've had bad service with bad food and good service with good food.   I'm guessing this is because there is such a high employee turn over rate. I've met no less than 4 managers of this particular location over the years, and none of them are still there.  The restaurant used to have all these cool decorations adorning the walls and ceiling and a disco ball and lights that would come on when the restaurant got busy. The reason for that was to get all the wait-staff to dance and distract the customers while the kitchen could get caught up during the break. I thought this was a brilliant idea.  Unfortunately, someone decided that was out-dated and they have completely (and, in my opinion, unnecessarily) renovated the inside and removed all the cool decor, and even the large shark that used to hang from the ceiling. What a shame. Now its just bland on the inside. Nothing special. I wish restaurants would focus more on the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant. I don't go to a restaurant for the decor and I don't go to a museum for the food.  All that said, I'm happy to report that on my most recent visit, the food was delicious and the service was excellent. However, I was a bit worried that my order was forgotten. Typically a salad comes out right  away.  They ended up bringing the salad out at the same time as everything else. I have no idea why they did that, but it's the only complaint I have for an otherwise perfect dining experience.   I did like the Pollock much more than the Cod, but I sure wish they'd bring back the Hoki. That's what made them unique. Fish and chips is often made with Cod, Pollock, Haddock, or even Halibut. I've never even heard of Hoki before. What a shame they choose to be like everyone else when what they had was so unique and delicious and couldn't be found at any other restaurant that I've ever been to in the Phoenix area.  I was initially going to make this a 3-star review, but everything was done so well on my most recent visit, I've bumped them up a star. Now, if they could just be more consistent with the menu, the food quality and the service...

My wife and I decided to try Eli's last night and was surprised that it was not very busy at dinner time on a Saturday night. We should have heeded that warning, but instead, went in and ordered dinner. Now we know why most of the reviews here are about Karaoke, bands and drinking and NOT the food.  The first problem we had is the place is so dark inside, you can barely see. The first booth they sat us at stunk so badly of vinegar my eyes were watering and my stomach started to turn. The waitress then moved us to another booth, but it still had that vinegar smell that was making me ill, but not as strong.  We decided to split the fish and chips combo (with fried jumbo shrimp) and waffle fries.   The waitress brought us fried jumbo shrimp, charged us $1 extra for a 'plating fee' (for splitting the food among two plates). I asked where the fish was and she looked dumb-founded. Then she left to correct the error, never offering to refill my drink.  Ensuring a dining customer always has something to wash down their food is waiting tables 101. If the wait staff doesn't have the time or the desire to keep refilling drinks, they should either offer larger drinking glasses (for soda and other free refill drinks) or the server should have brought two so she wouldn't have to worry about it. It costs her nothing whether I touch the second one or not, and it saves her time should I need a refill after that. Or, let the customer get their own fountain drinks, as many other establishments do. The irony is I drank that soda while waiting for the food to arrive. While the food was served hot, my drink was dry and the waitress just vanished on us, leaving us no choice but to sit there and watch for her (in a very dark building) to get her attention while our food grew cold.  The jumbo shrimp was very good. The waffle fries tasted like frozen Orieda fries you can buy at any grocery store. They didn't taste bad, but they didn't taste fresh. Done eating our shrimp and fries, the fish finally showed up. Two pieces actually. The amount of fish was less than expected, considering we were served 6 of the jumbo fried shrimp. But after we tasted the fish, we agreed any more would have been a waste. The fish was flavorless. Not only was it bland, it had a very fishy taste to it.   Adding insult to injury was the price. That ONE meal with two drinks (both non-alcoholic) came out to $30+.  Bottom line, if you're looking for a bar to buy over-priced drinks, listen to drunk people sing off-key and watch sports on numerous TVs that you cannot hear, this is, apparently, the place to be. They typically call these types of places a KARAOKE BAR. On the other hand,  If you're looking for a nice, sit down RESTAURANT, go to Guido's on the other side of the street. It's well lit on the inside, far cheaper and Guido's broasted fish and chicken are to die for! Lesson learned.

My wife and I tried this place (pronounced as 'CHEE-BO')a few months ago and have been back at least a half-dozen times since. If you like real Italian/Naples style pizza, this is your place. While they also do a specialty pasta dish a couple days during the week, pizza is really the heart and soul of the place.  I like to dine here when the weather is nice and we can eat outside. On Friday and Saturday nights, they have a live jazz band outside. This can be a very romantic place to go and I highly recommend it for a date.   All the deserts (except one) are using Nutella as an ingredient. I am not a fan of Nutella, but I must say the Pellani 2.0 is most excellent and only about $6. What is it? Imagine donut holes being served in a little metal basket with four wooden spears. You spear the donut hole with the little stick, then dip it in the ramekin of Nutella to your taste and enjoy! or, feed each other - very romantic.  The prices for what you get are very reasonable. Parking can be a challenge or you can use their complimentary valet.  Lot's of stuff to do downtown very close to this place (Film Bar, Angel's Trumpet, Crescent Ballroom, Breadfruit bar...too many things to do in this area that I can list here).  Highly recommended, but very limited menu. If you like REAL pizza, in a unique and romantic atmosphere and very affordable. I only wish I knew about this place sooner.

My wife and I ate here for the first time earlier tonight after I did a Google search for romantic restaurants in the Phoenix area and it brought up this Yelp page. Being a 'simple' man, I don't care for most of the high-end restaurants that serve things I can't even pronounce, let alone have any interest in eating. So, a few of the things that attracted me to Tarbell's were that it's centrally located (most fine dining establishments are in Scottsdale) and seeing familiar food on the menu I would enjoy.  I made reservations (to celebrate our anniversary and my wife's birthday.) Upon arriving, there was no available place to self-park, so I used the complimentary valet service. We were seated immediately upon arrival and, for a Saturday night, the place was not as busy as I expected it to be.  I like that there is a TV showing sports over the bar area. Its situated so that those in the dining area don't really see the single TV - but its right there for those at the bar.   They started by serving us four warm mini French breads (each the size of a dinner roll, about the three slices each) with a ramekin of olive oil along with two glasses of ice water.  We ordered the mac and cheese as a starter and my wife got the pan-roasted chicken and I ordered the Margherita pizza. As you could guess, we aren't adventurous eaters and pan-roasted chicken is a simple and 'safe' dish. My wife enjoyed it, and it looked perfectly cooked. My Margherita pizza was amazing. I've eaten at places known for the their pizza and Tarbell's (who I didn't even know offered pizza until today) makes one of the best pizza's I've ever tasted! A flat-bread style crust, hand made mozzarella, fresh, full, un-cut basil leaves (the biggest and most flavorful basil I've ever tasted) and the pizza sauce was too good for words. I find most pizza makers use too much sugar or too much salt in their sauce. I am happy to report that Tarbell's pizza sauce tastes almost bitter by comparison. Its very hard to describe, but being a person who loves pizza, if I opened my own restaurant, this is the pizza I would make and serve! Even the cooking was perfect. A slight singe of burn along just the far edges of the crust!   Mac and cheese was also VERY good!  For dessert, I had the creme brule and my wife had the vanilla cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce. A little bit of rosemary can go a long way, so my wife was concerned that the rosemary may be over-powering and the waiter offered to bring the cheesecake with the sauce on the side. Turns out, the sauce was just fine, but the cheesecake was very, very rich! Just a few bites and took the rest home for a few bites later! The creme brule' is served cold. This is the second restaurant that I've been to that does this. Only the top of the creme brule' is warm and the center is chilled. The best creme brule' I've ever had was on the 93rd floor of the Hancock Building in Chicago. There is a restaurant there (name eludes me at the moment) and I had a vanilla bean creme brule', served HOT, and it blew my mind! The creme brule' at Tarbell's seemed a little basic compared to everything else. It was good, but then I've never really had a *bad* creme brule', either.  It seems a lot of other reviewers were greeted by the owner. We did not see the owner around, but it would have been cool to meet him. Maybe next time...  They seem to employ a lot of people. They all dress in black and a couple of big guys just looked over the dining area, like they were the Secret Service or something! It was odd to feel like bodyguards are watching over you, but then when I got up to view some pictures on the wall of the owner with famous people, I rested my napkin on the table. When I returned, my napkin was neatly folded! When my Coke ran dry, within a minute or two, a waitress arrived with another! Fantastic service! I was concerned at first because the soda glasses are tall and thin, and when filled with ice, doesn't leave much room for soda. That means constantly running out, trying to find the waiter and have anxiety thinking about it. Not here!!! Everything is taken care of for you. I also like that the wait staff are not over-bearing - like when we ate at Fleming's Steakhouse and the darn wait staff would constantly be scraping our table with a crumb-scraper thing. It's just stupid and annoying. They don't do that here!!! Thank goodness!!  My wife had a glass of wine with dinner and I had a Coke. Our total, with tax, was $86 +$15 tip plus $3 tip for the valet when picking up the car. One of the best investments I've ever made in my relationship!

I was very disappointed to learn that Luxottica (the biggest eye-ware company on Earth) owns Target and Sears optical, they also own all the frames in their stores (Ray Ban, Oakley).  Last year, Luxottica made over 77 million pairs of sunglasses and optical frames. They don't make prescription lenses. They also own Sunglass Hut (the largest sunglass chain in the world), Pearl Vision Centers, Lens Crafters (the largest eye-wear retail chain in North America. The average cost of frames and lenses at Lens Crafters is about $300).Luxottica make glasses for  prada, burberry, ralph lauren, bvlgari, tiffany, dolce & gabana, channal, etc... Their prices are outrageous. Luxottica frames, purchased at a Luxoticca retailer, are still charged at full MSRP. Want to have your product offered in a Luxottica-owned store? Good luck! It's a monopoly offering an illusion of 'choices' to uninformed consumers.  At one time Oakley got into a dispute about pricing with Luxottica, so Luxottica dropped them from their stores. Oakley's stock immediately dropped and then Luxottica bought them out.  Biggest competitor is Wal-Mart and Cost Co.  Luxottica can set prices and there is nothing you can do about it other than NOT buy it. Luxottica also owns the nation's second largest insurance vision care plan, EyeMed.  My glasses cost $600+tax at Target and I had to pay the optometrist an additional $60 for the eye exam. The optometrist does not work for Target or Luxottica.   As for the quality of the glasses, they had to send the lenses back 3 times before I could see clearly out of each eye with the glasses on. The employees didn't seem to care that my vision was worse with the glasses on. They suggested I just wear them and get used to it. I argued that the whole point of getting glasses is so I can see clearly out of both eyes at the same time - not one eye blurry and one eye clear and be told to get used it for $660.  By my third visit they got the prescription right. I am finally happy with the glasses but I know I was charged a minimum of 10x to 15x  what they cost to make. I'll be going to Cost Co or Wal-Mart for my eye exams from now on.  More info here: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/luxottica-eyewear-why-are-glasses-expensive/

Let down and disappointed by what was once a great hospital. My mother has cancer and had a fall at home and could not get back up without assistance. Her doctor advised her to go to the emergency room asap. When I received her call, I dropped everything I was doing and picked her up in my car and drove her the 30+ miles to this specific hospital. Triage had us in the waiting room for almost 2 hours. Then they took blood and then they placed her in a room, where we would wait (ignored) for another 2 hours.  There was never any indication why we had to wait so long. There was never any staff checking-in to let us know they didn't forget about us, nor did they give us any estimated time before we could see the doctor, nor did they apologize for any of this.  When the doctor (apparently, Mayo can only afford ONE at a time) arrived at our room and introduced himself, I said we've been waiting more than four hours to see him. Did he apologize? Did he have a reason why? All he said was "Its been one of the those days." Really? You think so? Try being the sick person literally dying for a moment of your attention.  This terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day started when I left to pick up my mother at 2pm on a Monday afternoon. We were at the hospital a little after 3pm. Triage did not enter her in the computer until 3:30 and it was after 5:30pm before we were put in to a room. It was after 7pm before we saw the doctor and after 9pm before being discharged.  I have one question for this doctor and everyone reading this:  If you knew the exact day and time of your death, how much would you pay to get one 'extra' hour of life on this Earth? As you approach that time, how much more would you pay? And if you were granted that extra hour, how would you want to spend it?  If triage didn't think her situation was an emergency, they should have said as much.  We were not offered the opportunity to eat or drink once we stepped into the ER (i hadn't eaten since the day before). That's more than seven hours for those doing the basic math, and an hour shy of 24 hours since I had anything to eat. Funny thing, 'EMERGENCIES,' and how we re-prioritize our agendas to accommodate them. To have it disregarded is adding insult to injury. Literally.  The hospital should have a clock and each patient's arrival time and depature time should be recorded and monitored. The 'average' wait time should be estimated based on these numbers each day, and shown on a live clock in the waiting room and online. I could've driven my mother to a hospital in California or Nevada in less time.  Emergency implies urgency. This hospital and its employees of the EMERGENCY room showed no motivation or empathy. The Hippocratic oath is just a formality to collecting a check, I guess.  We could have gone to dinner, saw a movie and then gone to the hospital and we would have still had hours to wait. This was so disrespectful and apathetic, I'm profoundly gobsmacked by the lackadaisical attitude of the entire staff.  If you're dying, or if your time has value, find a real emergency room.

UPDATE: Mom died on August 9th, just 3 weeks after this visit. Not only did they needlessly waste what precious time she had left, they completely failed to do a pet scan to see how much further her cancer had progressed, hence the symptoms she was experiencing that required IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.  With regards to Mayo's response to this review of 'we'll try better next time' - There will be no NEXT time. She died. All Mayo clinic did was squander 9 hours of what little time she had left, filled with seemingly endless anxiety waiting for someone to properly examine her. That never happened. They simply gave her a blood test and told her that her potassium was low. All the while, sacks around her heart were filling with fluid, compressing her heart more and more each day...  Might as well have gone to Africa and had a medicine man wave chicken bones over his head while chanting for all the good Mayo did.

This is my go-to place for Italian comfort food. They have the best pizza and wings at very reasonable prices. I wish they had Coke instead of Pepsi, but the manager (Mark) and employees really make you feel like you're their friend and the food quality, service and speed is consistent.  My wife also enjoys other dishes there, such as the ravioli and some of the unique limited-time dishes they offer.  You should know this is not like the Red Devil restaurants that have traditional waiter service. This is a 'Bistro' version of the Red Devil chain. What that means is you order and pay for your food at the counter when you come in. They give you a number to place on any table you wish to sit at. They also give you clean drinking cups to help yourself to the Pepsi-product-array of fountain drinks or tea.  On Friday and Saturday evenings the wait can be as much as 45 minutes. I often see large groups of people there. Last week we saw one group of 25 people, who took up about half of the restaurants available tables. Then I saw other groups of 5 and 7 and even 10, be put on the waiting list or already seated.  I imagine because the food is so good and the quality is excellent, it is ultimately cheaper for large groups of people to eat here then most traditional restaurants where, at $15-$20 per person, feeding 25 people can require a loan. At Red Devil, I'd estimate the average person can eat and be full for around $10-$12 per person.  Bottom line - great food at great prices with wonderful service. If you don't like to wait, avoid it on Friday and Saturday evenings. But that goes for any GOOD dine-in, non-fast-food, restaurant in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  I've been going here for years and I don't plan to stop going any time soon. An order of 10 wings, half mild, half medium and made crispy is soooo good there! Combine that with a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and a Pepsi and you'll understand my enthusiasm for this place!

Although located about 40 miles east of where we live, we've heard so much about this place, my wife and I decided to check it out and we are glad we did. I ordered the fish and chips, which is my second favorite fish and chips place I have had. I used to like Skeptical Chemist and Fibber McGee's for fish and chips, but they got cheap and dropped all the food quality. So Guido's broasted fish is my first and foremost favorite and everything else has been terrible. That is, until I went to SanTan Brewing Co. The fish and chips were excellent and there was a lot of variety on the menu. I did not try the pizza because they use a three cheese blend, which to me, is cheap and not authentic Italian style pizza as advertised. For example, they offer a Margherita pizza. This should be a thin crust, hand cut mozzarella ONLY, with a light pizza sauce or slices of tomatoes topped with basil. SanTan makes a Margherita pizza with a cheese blend of mozzarella, chedder jack and Parmesan. I only like Parmesan on my pasta, not on my pizza. If you're going to do a cheese blend, make it GOOD cheeses, such as Asiago, Provolone and Mozzarella or even smoked Mozzarella. By definition, what they offer on the menu as a Margherita pizza is nothing at all like a REAL Italian Margherita pizza (named after Queen Margherita).   My wife ordered the 'street tacos' which were much larger then we expected. You get 3 of them, your choice of beef or chicken. She ordered two beef and one chicken taco and she could only eat half of what was brought to her. Street tacos are typically called street tacos because they are smaller in size then regular tacos. Apparently, no one told them or they're doing it intentionally to be different. It was too much food.  I guess the restaurant used to be a bank. They still have the safe door open (by the rest rooms) and the waiting benches at the lobby are old safe deposit boxes with padded foam on top. This is neat and unique, though I wish there was more explanation of why those items were kept. If keeping the history of the building alive was important, why not include more information about what the building was and why those items were selected to become part of the decor of the new business?  It is a little bit pricey, but not terribly so. The food and service were excellent and we will definitely dine here again the next time we're ready to make the 40 mile (each way) trip from Glendale.

This is my favorite pizza place in the state. They are always consistent on food quality and service. Because they charge an average of $2 per topping regardless of the pizza size, it makes the most financial sense to only order a large.  I recommend you order 'The Carey' - this is a large pizza with pepperoni and mushroom, with extra cheese and extra basil, well done. In my experience, it's the perfect combination of ingredients.  They 'stoke' the oven each day from 4p-5p, so no pizzas can be made during this time. Expect a 90 minute wait or longer for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night.  The salads they offer are big enough to share.  Now if they only carried Coke instead of Pepsi, it would be perfect! :)  PS: During the entire month of March, every year, the LA Dodgers are here for spring training just down the street. And practically every day after training, Tommy Lasorda can be found here enjoying the food and wine.

It's tough to find good seafood in the desert. I've eaten at Oscar's Pier 83 about a dozen times now and finally feel like I can write a useful review about it. They use small salad shrimp for their shrimp cocktail. It tastes good, I just wish they used the more traditional size shrimp or even the jumbo shrimp that they offer deep fried. Speaking of deep fried, the cod and shrimp are always good. The breading is not too thick and sticks well to the fish. The pasta salad is also good. It wasn't until my 10th visit that I realized I could order steak fries instead of the shoe-string fries that come with the fish and chips. I wish potato wedges were an option, to make it a more authentic 'chip' to go with the fish, but the steak fries taste good and cost .50 more.  When it comes to prices, they are a bit pricey. However, about every other week or so they run an ad for 20% off in the free New Times newspaper (available at Valero gas stations as well as other businesses around the valley. New issues come out on Thursdays.) With 20% off, the prices are much more reasonable.  I realize getting fresh fish to the desert is probably costly and the prices reflect that.   I don't think the same person has ever taken my order. They either have a high employee turn-around or they have a lot of employees. I haven't figured out which one it is yet.  They also have a free 'Bellycard.com' which works like a grocery store loyalty card program. Each time you are there, you have it 'read' your loyalty card and you get 5 points (just for being there. No ordering required.) Once you have 15 points, you can use it for a free drink or 10% off the price of your meal (not to be combined with the 20% coupon mentioned above.) This also helps with the price. It's not unusual for my wife and I to dine there for about $35. With 20% off, that can bring the price to under $28.   The broiled cod dinner is good. Not bad, but not spectacular. The clam chowder is really good! The coleslaw is just okay.   The atmosphere is a bit like a fast food place. No need to get dressed up. The parking is a little weird in that there are only about three parking spots in front of the building, but there are rows of parking lanes a short distance away. I often park by Quiznos instead. This will make more sense when you experience it.  I wouldn't drive across the valley to eat here, however. The food isn't worth a trip from the east side. If you're on this side of town and craving fresh seafood, then it's definitely worth checking out.

I wanted to update my review after eating here tonight. Basically, the staff are super-friendly, but apart from not having enough tables, their prices are way too high for what you get, in my experience of getting similar food elsewhere.  Here's my bill:  2 piece cod and fries: $9.99 Upgrade thin fries for thick fries: $ .50 2 Jumbo Shrimp: $3.20 ($1.60 each) 1 regular drink: $1.89  Sub-Total: $15.58 Tax: $1.59 Grand Total: $17.17  Yes, over $17 dollars for one meal!  As for the discount coupon in the Phoenix New Times, well, apparently after I published my original review letting people know how to save some money from this expensive place, they haven't offered any more coupons in the New Times since.  The food is good, but is marked up approximately 25% higher then what I would consider to be reasonable.  Also, the receipt they hand you does not list anything you ordered. Only the sub-total, tax and grand total. It's impossible to confirm if what you were charged is accurate without breaking out a calculator and doing the math yourself while you are there looking at the menu with prices listed on the wall behind the counter.  Again, the food is good and the staff are friendly, but neither is good enough to justify these prices and to stand around waiting for a table to become available.

This is by far the most dingy, dirty and disgusting restaurant I have stepped foot in, ever. But, the food is good, right? If you read the reviews here, you'd certainly have reason to believe that. We just got back from there and let me share my experience with you.  First, it looks like a dangerous place to be hanging out. Second, there was no air conditioning. Third, although we intended to eat there, they put our food in containers to go. While waiting 25+ minutes for our order, I saw two dining tables being used to stack empty pizza boxes and kitchen containers. It looked like they've been doing this for quite some time. I saw a bug crawling along the wall, another crawling across the floor. There are no plates, no utensils and no napkins. The walls were so dirty and dusty, they appear to be 'furry.'  The 'dining' area also contains two industrial shelving units with over-flow kitchen needs and a refrigerator with a lock on the door. IN THE DINING AREA!  Let's talk about the food. Soda is only available in cans. We ordered the deep fried mushrooms, a 5-cheese pizza with garlic crust and a dozen wings.  There is a lot of talk about things being fresh here, but the mushrooms were clearly frozen, akin to Ore-Ida available in the frozen section of any grocery store. They were luke-warm at best, while the pizza would burn the roof of your mouth off, it was so hot. The chicken wings were clearly frozen, as well. So, let's talk about the pizza...where do I start? First, the 5-cheese pizza wasn't even on the menu. I only knew about it from reading other reviews here. It was cooked well. That's the best thing I can say about it. The crust is as thick as the toppings. There was almost no tomato sauce. It tasted like a big, cheesy garlic bread. Not pizza.  The wings were slimy and under-cooked. I prefer wings to be crispy. How things can come out of a deep fryer and be limp and soggy suggests to me they were not cooked long enough. There is no MEDIUM flavor for the wings. Your choice is MILD or HOT. They mixed the mild and hot sauces together to accommodate my request for medium. The sauce wasn't bad, but there was so much of it, I wonder if they think I ordered hot sauce and asked them to throw a few chicken wings in it for flavor.  We weren't planning on taking the food to go, but since we had no other choice, we brought it home with us. In doing so, the container that held the wings leaked through bag and almost stained the seats of my car if I hadn't caught it in time. I sacrificed my pants instead.  Now I know not to trust any reviews from anyone who left a 5-star review for this place. Just wow. I think this place is badly in need of an inspection from the health department.  If you decide to eat here and you're weighing this 1 star review against all the positive reviews, just know that I did my best to warn you.  The real shame is two-thirds of the food we brought home from this place went right into the trash can. It doesn't matter how cheap it is if it's inedible.  On the plus side, the staff were all very friendly.

We just got back from trying Pork on a Fork's baby back ribs and here's my thoughts:  The good: 1) The ribs were EXCELLENT! Exactly the way I like them! The pulled pork was also good and served WITHOUT any sauce, so you can pick which sauce you prefer. 2) Four different home made BBQ sauces - Sweet and Mild, Smoky and Tangy, Hot and zippy mustard glaze and they have just made them available to purchase by the bottle, as well. 3) Very friendly and helpful staff. 4) Reasonable prices, quick service, clean restrooms,  5) You can order the food already smoked and cooked, but served cold in a foil baking tray to heat up at your own home at a later time or day. They recommend consuming it within 7 to 10 days which is more than reasonable and the ribs may be even better as they sit and soak up the sauce and become more tender. 6) Mac and cheese side dish is delicious!  The bad: 1) Hard to find the restaurant - its located in an industrial park. 2) Waffle fries don't taste as good as they look. I'm guessing these are not home made, but frozen from a mass manufacturer like Oreida or some such... 3) Different prices on some of the same dishes on Friday's only as well as other sides available on Fridays only from 4pm to 7pm. Its a bit confusing to have a Friday Menu that has many of the same items as the regular menu at a slightly higher price. I understand items like Smoked Salmon are only available on the Friday menu, but why is the regular menu disregarded on Fridays and the prices different? 4) Closes early (7pm Mon - Fri) and 3pm on Saturday.  Summary - This is our new favorite place for baby backs and pulled pork. Will try the beef brisket in the near future. Highly recommended!! And ,they accept debit and credit cards where many other small BBQ restaurants are cash only, which I find inconvenient. So that's a plus, as well.

A Google-search for 'real' macaroons led us to this Yelp page. Though we live 30 minutes away, my wife and I drove there to check out it. The parking lot was sparse and many of the surrounding buildings in the plaza are gone. I worried maybe the place was no longer in business, but once I turned my head it was there for all to see. The chef/owner Gerald was at the counter and greeted us. We had a lot of questions and he patiently answered them all.   He says likes to do things differently with his recipes, and that's not just talk. We tried a sesame-covered chocolate that he says was inspired by his time in the middle-east. A strange combination, I thought. So I tried it and it was amazing!  I also tried many flavors of the macaroons. (Almond is my favorite so far).  I don't like 'rich' or really sweet foods, so I don't have much of a sweet tooth for cakes and such. But his cakes looked amazing. He said his Creme Brule' is made with apples or with blueberries. Not sure how I feel about that, but I admire his ingenuity!  The crime is that the place is so well hidden that not enough people know it exists. And too many Americans think a macaroon is a coconut flavored cookie in the shape of a swirl. You couldn't be more wrong!  Prices were reasonable and I wanted to try everything!  But I exhibited some discipline so that I will have more new things to try on my next visit. Oh yes, there will be a next visit!

I ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom pizza for carry out. It was done on time, however, they used canned mushrooms and ruined a promising pizza. The pizza also had a salty taste, was very dry and cost $14.21, which is the most I've paid for a 2-topping medium pizza in a long time. And good luck getting any menu info on the web-site. Click on appetizers and it brings up salads. No prices are listed and no pictures of the food except cover-shots on the hone page.  I had a bad feeling about it when I placed my order and I couldn't understand the person on the phone. It sounded like they answered saying 'hello' and I had to confirm this was Palermo's Pizza. I told them what I wanted and they said 'ok bye' and then realized they hadn't got my phone number and asked for it. Then said 'ok bye' again without telling me how long it would take. So I asked 20-30 minutes? They said 'yes. ok bye.'  I figured it must have been busy. I went in to pick up my pizza and there were only 4 customers in the place with 2 visible employees.   Its ironic that I paid extra for an added topping (mushrooms) that not only cost me more, but ruined the pizza. Whatever amount of money they are saving using canned ingredients instead of fresh, they just lost 100x fold in my future business. I'll be looking elsewhere for a true New York style pizza. This isn't it.

Deep fried mushrooms here are amazing. $2 onion rings are a great buy! The pulled pork is great! But the prices are high (they are currently offering a groupon of $30 of food for $19).  Be sure to see the Flamingos in the bar and say hello to Fluffy, the albino alligator, while you're there!  When I got the bill for my meal, the suggested tip amounts are including tax. I don't tip on tax and I don't know anyone who does. All tips are based on the value of what the customer ordered. The restaurant collecting tax on behalf of the government should not be calculated as extra money for the server. If the server did a great job, they deserve a tip much larger than that. This practice seems is, in my opinion, deceitful to customers who aren't paying attention or who are just bad at math.

My wife and I ate here because we were in the mood for 'fresh' hamburgers. When we arrived on a Sunday about 6:30pm, the place was almost completely empty. This scared me a little, but there was a local NFL game starting at that time (Cardinals vs Seahawks) and, it seems, everyone was at the game. I'm told the place normally has a wait to get in.  Inside, they have 4 large flat screen TVs (3 over the bar, 1 at the opposite corner) showing sports with closed captioning on (thank you!).  My wife and I each ordered burgers and she had a side of the Mac and Cheese. My burger came with fries.  The hamburger buns are very unique. They are like a swirled garlic bread. However, there was really no noticeable garlic taste, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. But each time I brought the burger up to my mouth, the aroma of garlic from the bread was quite nice.  The Mac and Cheese has elbow macaroni sitting a soup of a cheese blend that is more like how 'grandma used to make' then you might expect. It was, like the burgers, exceptional.  The fries are shoestring style (very thin, very crunchy) and everything tastes fresh (not frozen) and home made. The burgers are not uniform in shape or thickness, which tells me they are made by hand. Hallelujah!  The service was outstanding. The staff was extremely attentive. I noticed they have a 'Vernors Pound Cake' on the desert menu. Vernor's is a drink made in Detroit (where I was born and raised). I asked if the restaurant was Detroit-inspired and was told it's actually Brooklyn, New York-inspired and they really like Vernor's Ginger Ale in New York.   They also have a root beer float on the menu, so I asked the staff if they offer a Vernor's float instead. (A Vernor's float is known by folks in Detroit as a 'Boston Cooler' and its no different than a root beer float, except you substitute Vernor's for root beer.)  They never heard of it before (not shocking, since no one outside of Detroit has ever heard of it) but they were more than happy to make one for me. And it was delicious!  My wife thought the ice tea she ordered tasted a little off, but she didn't say anything to the staff. I have no doubt they would have made it right if she brought it to their attention.   She also ordered the Vernor's Pound Cake for desert. She thought it was too rich for her liking, but it wasn't bad by any means.  It appears the three restaurants beside each other are all owned and run by the same entity. There is Charr, then a pizza place (Isa's Pizza) and then a fine dining restaurant called Aiello's East Coast Italian.  There were plenty of items on the menu I wanted to try, such as baby back ribs and a grilled chicken sandwich. The pizza served next door looked good and Aiello's also looks like a nice place for us to try as well.  So we have four reasons to go back (try each of the other two restaurants, try other menu items at Charr, and if worse comes to worst, we would definitely go back to Charr and have REAL, fresh handmade burgers again! If I was going to open my own burger joint, this is similar to how I would do it.  There's only so many fast-food burgers one can ingest before desperately craving something that isn't factory made and doesn't require a loan to pay off. (our complete total for dinner and desert was $39 after tax. Quite reasonable and fair considering the quality and quantity of the food and the excellent service we received.)

I'm originally from Detroit, so seeing this is a chain in Michigan now a few miles from my house in Arizona, I was quite psyched to eat here.   You go to the counter to order and pay for your food, then seat yourself.  We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, mushroom and extra cheese along with two sodas. The total was $21.12. They have lots of neat old electronics decorating the inside, from old console TVs to 8-track players and even an old projector and a ViewMaster! Cool stuff!  The pizza was cut into squares. I don't know why, since this is traditionally done with a square pizza, not a round pizza. The problem is that it makes it quite messy to eat and because there are so many more slices as a result, when the person cutting the pizza doesn't press down hard enough on the pizza cutter, what you really have is a 'suggestion' of where the cuts are, requiring a knife to actually cut the crust and separate the pieces, over and over and over and over again.  The pizza would be easier to eat if if were cut traditionally, and wouldn't be as messy. But that doesn't matter if it tastes good.  However, this pizza was not bad, but it was not what I consider to be 'good,' either.  The crust, cheese and pepperoni were excellent. The sauce tasted flat, almost like something was missing. My wife thought it tasted salty. I didn't notice a salty taste, but I predict it was coming from the pepperoni.  They used fresh mushrooms, but they didn't seem to have the same flavor or texture as fresh mushrooms typically have on a pizza, but that may be because of how they cut them or how 'fresh' they actually were.  I really wanted to like this place and I left disappointed.   If this was my pizza place, I would offer a 'tangy' pizza sauce, I would cut the pizza traditionally and I would offer garlic powder in addition to grated Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper shakers they currently offer.  They brag nothing has changed since 1961 with regards to how they make their pizza. If this is how it was in 1961, I'm glad I wasn't alive back then. Sometimes change is good! Better yet, offering customers choices is even better. Would it be a big deal to offer a 'white' pizza or other types of sauces? The cost would be low and the variety would be increased ten-fold.  It has promise, but I doubt I'll be seeing any changes given how they brag they haven't ever changed, so I have no reason to go back and try them again.  I have to remember not every restaurant in Michigan is great, but I was hoping this was one of them. Sadly, I was wrong.  PS - Friendly staff but the location is a bit hard to find since it's buried in a crowded  multi-strip mall and only faces traffic heading one direction, so if you're coming from any of the other three possible directions, it cannot be seen from the road and there are several shopping centers on each corner, so good luck picking the right one to drive around to find it.

This place should have been named "The Pretentious Cowboy."   The staff and atmosphere are wonderful (if you're into the whole cowboy thing) but as much as they dress it up as fine dining, its really just a sports bar with a limited food menu with small, over-priced portions unnecessarily dressed up to  appear fancier than what they really are. There is no children's menu and the drinks side of the menu has many more options than the food side of the menu. Again, this is just a sports bar. There is no explanation of what their "barrel sauce" is and, apparently, they put it on everything.  My wife and I wanted to try something new . The place looks nice on the outside and it looks nice on the inside. We order the pretzel appetizer ($6) which comes with about 8 little buttered pretzel nuggets and a spicy nacho cheese in a ramekin. When dipping the pretzels in the cheese, its amazing to pull the pretzel out and find no cheese on it, so a scooping motion is necessary. I guess the cheese won't stick to the butter. It tasted great, but honestly, this is a bar and the warm pretzels should just be served as you're seated as a free item (like bread, you know like Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden, Texas Roadhouse, Tarbell's, etc...) to get you thirsty and offer the dipping sauce at an additional charge. I can get three times as many pretzel nuggets just as good with cheese for the same price at any pretzel store in any shopping mall. I don't understand why they are so stingy with the portions on such a cheap item to make.  If this was my place, once my customers were seated, I would serve them a tray of hot, unsalted, un-buttered, PLAIN pretzel nuggets. On the tray I would have at least 6 ramekins. One each of kosher salt,  melted butter, spicy cheese, cream cheese, mustard and one with the signature 'barrel sauce.' Let the customers play with the 37+ different flavor combinations at their discretion. This gets them thirsty!! Now the drinks don't seem so over-priced. If the nuggets run out, just like with bread at any other restaurant, ask if they would like more. Some will just want to drink, others may want dinner instead.  For dinner, my wife orders a salad only to find the portion is again too small and the core of the lettuce has been used. At these prices, this is unacceptable. She also orders the chicken tortilla soup and finds it tastes more like a minestrone soup.  I just ordered the chicken wings appetizer, which is advertised on the menu as 'crispy'.  What arrives are not crispy wings. They have a sticky sauce (not hot wings like I expected from the description on the menu) and they cost $9.50 (more than a dollar each) and are covered in scallions. Scallions? On chicken wings? To make it 'fancy' they drizzle this mustard looking sauce on the plate before placing the wings. I ask what that is, and they explain it's their 'barrel sauce' (which is pretty much on every item on the menu). It's an aioli sauce. Something I don't expect on chicken wings. There are also four sticks of celery. Hope you like that barrel sauce they drizzled on the plate before placing the food because its on your celery now, too.  If I wanted the sauce on my celery, I would scrape my celery against the plate where the sauce was. Also, the celery slices were twice the size as the wings. If it's presentation we're talking about, its just bizarre. Did I order celery with a side of wings?   Why not put it all in a blender and then serve it to me that way? It all ends up that way in our stomach anyway, right? Problem is, our taste buds are not in our stomach or our eyes. Our nose and tongue are what need to be pleased when we eat. From the flavor, the smell and the texture - some things are best left alone or offered as options. Why were the pretzels not already covered in cheese? Because they would be a soggy mess and maybe have too much cheese for someone's taste, or perhaps they prefer them plain. Options, get it? Let people eat the way they want to eat, NOT the way the chef prefers. The chef can make his wings any way he likes, and I'd like that same consideration without having to make a 'special request.'   The service and atmosphere were both excellent, but the food just plain sucks. They take something simple, like chicken wings, burgers or grilled chicken sandwiches, dress them up on the menu with a fancy plate and ruin it by removing the simplicity and justifying a higher menu price. In a word, it's pretentious.  Again, the menu was extremely limited. A cowboy place that doesn't offer t-bone steak, but does offer New York and prime rib? That's odd.   Bottom line, for two sodas and those four small portioned and oddly prepared menu items was $32.86 + I left a $5 tip for the waitress (who was excellent). We both left hungry and will never return.  Notice how many of the positive reviews here are referring to the alcohol. Each alcoholic drink made the way the customer wants, thousands of possible combinations. Ironic, isn't it?

Had a tough day and I wanted to treat myself to a nice dinner. I drove to the downtown location, rather than the Glendale location, based on the reviews I read here. Big mistake. First, you have to pay for parking downtown. Even on the weekends and evenings. Second, even though the restaurant was mostly empty, they had no less than 6 employees on staff, each given a specific task. The person that greets you, seats you and gives you menu's. The busboy brings you water. The waitress takes your drink order and comes back with the drinks and then left us far too long before coming back to take our dinner order. The folks behind the counter seem to pour the drinks and make the food.  Our food was delivered to our table by the folks behind the counter. The waitress seems to have it pretty easy here compared to the typical duties of a waitress at just about any other restaurant, which is why it's hard for me to understand why we were never visited again by our waitress during our meal. She was too busy chatting it up with a couple seated at the bar. I glanced her way and stared several times, hoping to get her attention because my drink was empty and I'm basically choking down dry bread. My meal has to stop until I can get something to wash my food down with. I give up, I get up with my empty drink and I take it to the counter. The man behind the counter knows what I was drinking and offers to refill it and bring it back out to me.  Suddenly, lo-and-behold, our waitress appears. Why our waitress was so inattentive and couldn't take a 2 minute break from her conversation to check on her table (and then she could go back to her conversation) is beyond mind boggling to me.  Now, let's talk about the food. I ordered the Romana salad, which was way over-priced for what you get at $9.95. It's basically some lettuce, crutons and salad dressing. Not much to making it, not much to it at all.  I also ordered the Regina Margherita pizza ($12.95) and my drink, a Coke, at $2.50. These are not cheap prices and the level of service should be equal.  There were flies buzzing all around our table, so I wish I would have sat outside.   The pizza was good, but the tomato sauce was a bit too 'sharp' for my taste.   There is another, similar restaurant called La Piazza Al Forno. They also have locations in downtown Phoenix and Glendale. They are also VPN certified, and I think the menu has more variety, cheaper prices, and, in my experience, much better service.  The excuse offered to me regarding my waitresses inattentiveness was that she was quitting her job in a couple of days and was saying goodbye to some regular customers. Again, she didn't have to stop talking to them, she just needed to excuse herself for two minutes to check on other customers. Its unlikely I'll become a regular customer, in part, because the waitress left me feeling alienated, or less important.  The total was $25.40 with $2.11 tax for a grand total of $27.51. A 10% tip on the pretax total would have been $2.54. If I was taken care of, I would have left $6, but since I got irritated for being ignored, I left her $3.00, which considering the circumstances, I thought was generous of me.  Everyone has a limited job to do. The cooks did a good job. The greeter did a good job. The busboy did a good job. I'd go so far to say this restaurant doesn't need waitresses. She was the only one who screwed up, and all she had to do was check in on us from time to time. I think the folks behind the bar could have easily done her job and she would be free to talk to her friends all day, every day. The customer would be taken care of and everyone would be happy. its a win-win-win situation. I cannot emphasize enough how easy the wait-staff has it at this location.  As for any after dinner treats delivered to your table after the meal (again, based on reviews I read here), I didn't get that. I got a bill. The waitress was fast to deliver the bill and to check back to collect the bill and deliver the receipt. Noted.  I found the food here to be good but over-priced and La Piazza Al Forno to offer similar food, that I think tastes better, at a cheaper price and with much better service.

Seriously, when I walk through the front door of Detroit Coney Grill, I feel like I am back in Detroit. From the smells, the tastes, the menu offerings and everyone's friendly demeanor, from the staff to the patrons. They need a sign on the wall when you walk in that says. "If You're From Detroit, Welcome Home!"  I'm originally from Oak Park, Michigan (a suburb of Detroit) and two of the things I miss the most are the food and the general kindness with which people treat each other there. Found out the owner (Dave? David?) is also from Oak Park (and used to live about 5 blocks from where I used to live!). They have regular hot dogs there and they have Coney's. The Coney is a hot dog with a natural casing, so it 'snaps' when you bite into it. My wife and I have driven to the famous Pink's hotdogs in Hollywood and had great chili dogs there, and this place stacks right up against them in every way!  The coney's are amazing. The fries are made just the way I make them at home myself. The people that work there and eat there are all very friendly and love to talk about reminiscing where we're all from and if you remember this place or that place back in the day back home (Detroit).  What a great place! Good prices, hours are kinda weird (closes at 7:30pm on weekdays and closed on Sundays) and it can be a little difficult to find as its smashed into the middle of a crowded strip mall with a medical marijuana license distributor a few stores down.  We made the trip from Glendale to try this place out and I was so impressed! I wish it was closer! But I predict I'll be making the drive again soon - and often! (Update - I've been there four times now and it seems like it just keeps getting better every time I go. Food is consistently great and people are consistently friendly and the service is consistent as well).  Loved having Vernor's in the glass bottle, and looking forward to trying the burgers next time, as well. (Update - we tried the sliders, which are a menu option only offered on certain days - they were amazing!)  They also just started offering Boston Coolers on the menu on Friday's and Saturday's. For those who don't know or remember, a Boston Cooler is Vernors blended with French Vanilla ice cream (almost like a root beer float). It is so good - and if you've never had one, I guarantee it tastes like nothing else you've ever had (in a good way!).  Trivia - Why is it called a Boston Cooler when it's from Detroit? It was named after Detroit's Boston Boulevard where it was reportedly first served. The history of the Boston Cooler has some conflicts. One story says that Mr. Sanders invented the drink at his store on the east side of Woodward Ave near Boston Blvd. The other story, and the one I like better, is that the drink was invented during Prohibtion by Grandpa Vernor for his grandchildren. According to legend, there was a milk man who delivered to the Vernor household. In his wagon he carried Strohs Ice Cream (Strohs had to give up brewing beer and changed their fire-brewed kettles over to ice cream production). James Vernor Sr. lived on Grosse isle but would visit the grandkids in Detroit. During one summer visit in 1921 the milkman and Grandpa Vernor delevoped a friendship and between the two of them they concocted the mixture of Strohs vanilla ice cream and Vernors Ginger Ale. It was called a Boston Cooler because the house was on Boston Blvd.  Detroit Coney Grill is a great place! Highly Recommended! Hidden Gem!!!  Also, I just learned they are getting ready to open another location on the west side of town (maybe 35th Ave and Bell Road?) That's a lot closer to my house, so I'm sure I will be eating there more often!  Disclaimer - I am not an investor, I did not know anyone who works there or runs the place (though I am getting to know them) nor do I have anything to gain (or lose) by posting this review.

First time here - and had to drive for 40 minutes from Glendale (each way!) for the sole purpose of dining here. The food was good, the service left a bit to be desired, and the restaurant gets so loud its hard to have a conversation with the other people at your table, (even if there is only ONE other person at your table - you have to talk LOUDLY to be heard.)  The worst part is when the bill came, they calculate a suggested tip based on the total of the bill. In America, we don't tip on tax. When I brought this to the manager's attention, instead of apologizing and being understanding of my concern, he poorly attempted to justify it by saying he has to pay tax on the total, so the tip is calculated on the total. I suggested if he was a server at any other restaurant franchise in the USA, he would know from experience tips are always calculated PRE TAX. Again, rather than apologize for it, he admitted customers have brought this to his attention and have complained about it for the last two years (since the restaurant opened here in Arizona) but that the corporation that owns the restaurant chain/franchise won't listen to their customers complaints.  I don't mind tipping 20% when the service and food are above average. I've scanned the receipt, and you can see they suggest a 20% tip of $6.95 of a food order totaling $32.15. Go ahead and do the math - I'll wait.  ...   Our state sales tax is almost 10%, so often a clever way to know how much of a tip to leave is to base it on how much tax you were charged. In this case, we were charged $2.60 tax, bringing our total to $34.75. Often doubling the tax gets you very near a 20% tip on what you actually paid for food. Tipping on the tax is insane and I challenge any reader to name any other restaurant franchise that makes tip suggestions on their receipts using the after-tax total.   In my case, it doesn't amount to much difference. But when you dine with a $100+ dollar invoice at the end of the meal, you are going to be WAY over-tipping since tax is being calculated in the suggested tip.  I find this practice reprehensible and deceitful. The restaurant should be ashamed and either remove the suggested tip if they don't want to follow American culture on tipping, or fix it in the point of sale software they use, which should not have allowed this as an option to begin with. It's basically taking advantage of their own customers who are bad at math or simply not paying attention. That kind of passive-aggressive disrespect and exploitation of your customers is shameful.

Just an update that 3 months after this review and writing the company directly about this passive-aggressive anti-consumer practice, they have not so much as acknowledged they have received my message or seem to care. Caveat Emptor.   This is clearly an anti-consumer business - they seem to only care about how much money they can deceitfully extract from your wallet with no conscious or morals.

After months and months of waiting for acknowledgment from Cheddar's about this issue, Cheddar's response is "6/16/2016  Hi Carey, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We would like to have someone reach out to you personally, so please send us a private message with your contact information. Thank you."  First of all, send you a private message where? Secondly, what about the two previous private messages I sent using the FEEDBACK survey on the receipt and the email I sent directly using the CONTACT US form on your web-site? Both of which were ignored.  I'm right here. Feel free to say publicly what you want to say to me privately. No national franchise charges tax on a tip. Go eat at Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Texas Roadhouse, Applebee's, Chili's, Cheesecake Factory... literally anywhere in the country and see for yourself.  Financially penalizing your customers for leaving a gift to their server is INSANE and discourages a generous gift.  I hope you order a pizza some day and when the delivery driver brings it to your door and you tip the delivery driver $5, I hope the delivery driver says to you, "Oh, if you're going to tip me $5, you have to give me $5.50 to cover the sales tax." I just want to see how outraged you are. Surely the simple solution is to take the $5 back and not leave any tip at all. I already pay tax on my income, I shouldn't have to pay tax on the servers income, too.  What is there to talk about? There is no precedent for this practice. There is no excuse for it. There is nothing to discuss. Change the deceitful and anti-consumer practice of charging tax on a tip. If and when you do, please let me know and I'll give you future business. Until then, I'm warning everyone I know to pay attention to the receipt they get at your establishment that literally NO OTHER NATIONAL FRANCHISE condones, practices or endorses.  Thank you. I look forward to your public response here.

My wife and I enjoyed a past visit to Tarbell's and signed up for their email list to learn of the two other business Mark Tarbell owns that are actually next door to one another - The Tavern and the The Wine Store. The email I received said that at The Tavern, for this one night only, they are offering "Beer-Battered Georges Bank Cod with Golden Fries, Fresh Coleslaw and Tartar Sauce, and your choice of a Beer or glass of Wine $25 per person (excluding tax and gratuity).   Having never been to The Tavern before, I didn't know what the expected wait time might be on a typical Friday night or if there was a dress code. Reservations can only be made for parties of 6 or more. I called them and spoke to 'Charlie' who let me know the place is small, but we will probably have no wait to be seated if we come in before 7:30pm. He asked for my name and said since he wasn't working in the evening, he suggested I ask to speak with "Corbin" when we arrive and to let him know this is our first time there.  He also informed me there is no dress code and people dine there dressed up or in t-shirts and shorts.    We were seated right away, I asked to meet Corbin, and he introduced himself and welcomed us to the restaurant. My wife and I both order the fish and chips special (the regular menu was also available to order from). I had an IPA beer and my wife a Pino Noir. My wife ordered the deviled eggs appetizer and enjoyed it (I don't eat deviled eggs.)  The fish used in the fish and chips was as fresh as I've ever had. The batter was firm and stuck well to the fish, however, it was very bland. Some chefs believe the fish should be bland to pick up the flavors of the tartar, but I like to eat my fish plain. No lemon, no vinegar and no tartar. My wife and I both needed to add salt to give the fish a missing flavor. It was perfectly cooked. The fries were like steak fries, and nothing special there, but not bad, either.  We ordered the ice cream sandwich dessert and shared it. It was very good. The total bill was $68 + a $12 tip for our excellent server "Jordan" I think he said his name was...  The staff was attentive without being over-bearing. The atmosphere is nice without being pompous. If I could get a Tarbell's pizza at The Tavern, I would be there at least 3 times a month!   To eat a similar meal at Tarbell's, by comparison, one should dress nicer than a t-shirt and expect to pay at least another $20-$30 for the dinner tab. In that aspect, its like getting Tarbell's quality food at a discounted price, however, the menu's are not the same. I wouldn't be surprised if the staff offered to get me a pizza from next door, but I wouldn't feel right about ordering something 'special' even if it were  an option. I'd just like to see it on the menu.  It was a bit loud in there and difficult to hold a conversation at times. But the staff all have personalities and make you feel welcome. Even when the gentleman came out to light all the candles at the tables, he struck up a unique conversation with each table as he lit their candle. Not just an 'excuse me, I'll be gone in a second' attitude, but "Hey, how's it going? Is everything good so far?" and, hence, a nice, friendly conversation as he went from table to table.  We'll definitely be back here (and Tarbell's too when I feel like opening the wallet a little bit wider.)

The building looks nice from the outside, so I figured if they spent that much time making the building look good, the food must be outstanding. It isn't.  I asked for a sample of the meat, and they brought me a sample of turkey and a sample of brisket. Neither of which I was considering ordering. So, I ordered the pulled pork, half a chicken and baby back ribs.  Little did I know that they completely ruin these meats by over-seasoning them. For example, the pulled pork tasted like someone dumped a bottle of mustard in it. Turns out, that's pretty much how they make it. The baby back ribs had so much black pepper (and I really like black pepper) it was burning my mouth.  Why would any 'chef' disguise the natural taste of smoked meats with seasoning? It completely ruins the flavor of the meat. Offer the sauces and pepper at the table and let the customer season it how they like. Don't force the customer to eat food seasoned the way YOU like it. Who does that? They take a perfectly good piece of meat and drown it in seasoning to the point where you can't taste anything but the seasoning? Seems like they are trying to cover something up. You know, in the old days they used a lot of salt, especially on spoiling meat (in the days before refrigeration). That's what this meat tasted like... like they had no refrigeration and needed to over-season it to cover the flavor. Why else would a chef do that?  The employees were very friendly, but you do have to do everything yourself. There is no wait staff and they have one of those arrogant signs on the wall that says "Your mother doesn't work here. Please clean up after yourself!"  That's all fine and good to tell an employee, but as a customer, that's just plan rude. Do you think that sign makes any difference? I always clean up after myself, sign or no sign. Others don't. Sign or no sign. They are basically saying you have to clear the table for their next customer. What's my incentive to do that?  Here is a quick summary of the food and prices from our receipt:  Small potato salad: $2.09 Small cole slaw: $2.09 2 medium drinks ($1.79 each): $3.58 1/2 BBQ Chicken: $5.99 1/2 lb of BBQ pulled pork ($9.98 per pound): $5.19 1/2 lb of BBQ baby back ribs (4 ribs - $14.98 per pound)): $7.79 Small cream corn (bland - no seasoning at all. Had to add salt): $2.39 Small peach cobbler - $2.19  Total: $31.31 Tax: $3.22 Grand total: $34.53  There is no one to tip and no tip jar. So at least they aren't greedy. The country store looks like a poor mans version of Cracker Barrel. Not much in there. Not sure what anyone would possibly buy there that you can't get at World Market or other department stores that have a larger selection and cheaper prices.  I really wanted to like this place, but they have given me little reason return. If I heard there was a BBQ chain worse than Famous Dave's, I wouldn't have believed it.  My stomach is severely upset (probably from the mustard sauce on the pulled pork. Mustard makes me nauseous and I had no idea anyone would even conceive of forcing the public to eat it without any warning that its not simply PULLED PORK. My guess is that my ribs and pulled pork were probably delicious before they ruined it with the seasonings.  The chicken was good, but its hard to screw up chicken. Lucky for me the seasoning was only on the skin. The chicken still tasted like chicken underneath the skin.  The dogs got the pulled pork. They seemed to enjoy it. Glad someone did.

If you're an elitist snob with more money than brains who enjoys being propositioned by money-hungry prostitutes all night while being harassed by overly aggressive bouncers with bad attitudes who will question whether or not you belong there based solely on your appearance, then this place is for you!

This seems to be a place run by millennials and for millennials. If you're a millennial, from the looks of things, you'll enjoy it. Its a Korean style food place with donuts. I don't get the big deal about donuts. Its fried bread. I've never had a bad 'fresh' donut, even if it fell on the floor!   The service is slow, the prices are high, they seem very disorganized. They were selling items they didn't have (ran out of dark meat chicken long before they stopped accepting orders for it). Took almost 30 minutes for one chicken breast.   This place is clearly a fad right now. As you get older, you'll see this cycle. New donut place, all the rage, lines out the door, outrageous prices and then, after a year or two people decide donuts are bad for them  (remember Krispy Kreme was opening up locations like crazy? Now try to find one.)  There are six booths inside and more seating outside. We didn't have much choice but to go outside since the line to order blocks access to four of the booths. While outside, there are very aggressive bees trying to eat your food. I like bees, but I prefer not to get stung while I'm having lunch. I'm funny that way.  If you want better selection, a nicer atmosphere and delicious chicken, check out Lolo's a couple of miles down the road.  Unless you're a millennial, in which case you and your man-bun will love it here.

After seeing the ad in the New Times, I found all of these wonderful 5-star reviews here on Yelp! However, this can be a bad thing, since it can set expectations unreasonably high.   The biggest problem is the location. Because it's not located directly inside of my house, I have to go out in public to get there. That's a special occasion, so to find it in an old, run-down strip mall is a bit disheartening.  There is room for just 30 chairs inside. When it's about 2/3's full of customers, it gets very loud! I said, IT GETS VERY LOUD!!!  However, the owners did a great job making the place look (and sound) much better on the inside than it does on the outside!  I have confirmed, as stated in previous reviews, it takes 30-45 minutes to receive food. (counting chairs is one way to pass the time...)  They also have very young (pre-teen) children delivering food to customers and clearing tables. I absolutely loved this. Proof it's a hard working family and everyone contributes. I hope those kids know how lucky they are to be participating in the process of building an American Dream (and that the restaurant is not owned by Kathie Lee Gifford!)  At the counter you order and pay for your food, as you would at a fast food restaurant. I'd describe Classic Crust as a Bistro. Seat yourself, put the number card the table and then wait.    The LED lighting they have is very cool.   They serve beer, but also have a serve-yourself Coke-branded fountain machine with common Coke products as well as a stand-alone refrigerator with glass bottles of Coke products from Mexico (Coke, Sprite, Fanta and the standard plastic bottle of Dasani water  - also a Coke product.)  Some prefer the Mexican Coke because it contains real sugar versus high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) they use here in the states.   The menu is above the counter - a large chalk board with everything hand written. Someone in the family must have been a teacher...   The chalk board menu proudly states their Margherita pizza is made with 'fresh mozzarella.' It's not stale mozzarella? Great! The word 'fresh' gets thrown around way too much. It's implied you are serving fresh food. If the food isn't fresh, it shouldn't be served. The cashier clarified it was actually buffalo mozzarella. Can you guess what I am going to suggest? Did you get it? You're going to make me say it, aren't you? Replace the word 'fresh' with the word 'buffalo.' Thank you for playing along.  They offer a gluten free crust. I didn't try it, but I love that they offer it.   At what time does lunch become dinner? I only ask because there was a 'lunch special' listed on the board (2 slices of pizza and a soda for $6), but it doesn't say WHEN lunch is!  From the menu you can choose a personal pizza, a large pizza or an extra large pizza. Let me translate this for you - the large is a medium and the extra large is a large.   We ordered a large pepperoni pizza with 10 wings, and an order of zeppoli.  The pizza is a New York-style thin crust with puddles and puddles of grease. For me, it's just too much grease. I found the pepperoni too salty and the pizza sauce way too sweet for my taste. However, the pizza crust was truly classic! The pizza looked and tasted similar to Papa John's. I wish I had a small ramekin of melted garlic butter to go along with that wonderful pizza crust.   There were 3 flat screen TVs showing sports (no closed captions were on) and music from the Stones, Zeppelin, Humble Pie and even Mungo Jerry, was being played! Classic rock, Classic Crust and a Coca-Cola Classic! That's classic!  The chicken wings were good, however, they appear to be baked rather than fried. The wings had good flavor and the sauce was also very good.  Imagine my surprise to learn the 'zeppoli' everyone here on Yelp was raving about is nothing more than a donut hole/beignet/Indian fry bread! Was it good? Yes. Was it amazing and deserving to be called something other than 'donut hole' or 'beignet' to properly describe it? They could have just as easily called it pelline (look it up - get the joke...)  The prices were fair. Not too cheap, not too expensive. Other reviewers mentioned it was 'freshest' pizza they ever had. Pizzeria Bianco was the freshest pizza I ever had (not the best pizza I ever had, but the freshest!).   I want to reiterate that everyone working here seems like honest, hard working people trying to create the American dream. I'm jealous this is not my family. It is not my intention to disparage their efforts with my review and I apologize if it comes across that way.   Overall, if your expectations are set correctly, you shouldn't be disappointed. Five stars implies a great atmosphere, great food, excellent and timely service and good value. For me, Classic Crust falls short of that, but I think (and I hope) they can get there. It's really just a 3-star for me, but I gave them the extra star because it's clearly a genuine family business and I want to see them succeed!

Had a Groupon and decided to try it out. Be warned, its in a very busy part of Scottsdale and its also a nightclub. Be prepared for parking 2 blocks away and long waits on Friday and Saturday nights.   Go during the week and avoid the crowds and parking hassles.   The food is fantastic! Loved the burgers! Loved the buns! Loved the fresh cut, crispy (but thick) french fries! Loved the Wisconsin Cheese Curds with marinara! Everything was really, really over-the-top delicious. The atmosphere is very cool. The staff are all very cool. The prices, even without the Groupon, are very reasonable (especially considering its location).  I will be dining here again soon!!!

After reading a nice review in the Phoenix New Times magazine, my wife and I decide to try ATL wings. Located on the southwest corner of 40th street and Thomas, the restaurant is easy to find and has a large sign visible from the roadway. The inside is clean and proudly boasts the A rating from the health department. The staff were all super-friendly (and displayed some excellent tattoos!)   Three flat screen monitors show the menu over the ordering counter (I love this!). They specialize in wings, so the menu is fairly limited. This is by design. The theory is rather than offer a ton of variety that is just 'okay,' they want to focus on one main item and do it really well! Therefore, the menu lists just chicken wings (bone-in or boneless), salads, fries, pancakes, biscuits and drinks. That is IT (apart from the ranch or blue cheese dressings/dipping sauces).  They have three different styles of wing - BBQ, HOT WING and DRY RUB. There are several flavor variations you can select under each style. We were puzzled what the ATL dry rub tasted like, since it has no description or point of reference. They asked if we would like to try it and offered us two chicken wings, free to taste. That was unexpected and the ATL dry rub was unlike the flavor of any chicken wing I've tasted before it. It was good, though, and so we ordered 10 wings with the ATL dry rub and 10 wings medium. We also ordered two fountain drinks and an order of the biscuits.   We paid at the counter, they gave us our self-serve drink cups, wrote my name on the receipt, told us to sit anywhere we like and they would bring the food out to us shortly.  The fountain machine is Coke products (yay!) and they also have tea (sweetened and un-sweetened)and three different flavors of Kool-Aid to choose from.  Just finishing filling our drinks and putting the lids and straws on our cups, when our order was being served! (Apparently, they pre-cook the wings about 3/4's of the way, then remove them. When you order, the wings go back in to cook for 3 more minutes, and then they're done! Don't worry, they don't let partially cooked wings sit out all day until you order them. Just like KFC, Popeye's, Church's Chicken and other fast-food chicken restaurants, pre-prepared menu items are 'under a clock.')   We don't like wet, soggy wings. Places that cook them in ovens or broilers often have this undesirable, gummy-like, chicken texture. I like my wings to be firm and a little dry. Let the sauce and my saliva draw out the texture and flavor of the chicken. I have to ask most places to make my wings crispy. But not here. That's the way come out by default and, I'm told, there are some customers who request they cook them even longer! God bless America! :)  I'm happy to report the wings were served piping hot from the fryer and the ATL dry rub tasted better and better the more I ate it. I can't figure out what's in it other than butter. Its a weird taste, but I kinda like it. The medium wings tasted really hot (spicy) but as I ate more them, I guess I started to become numb to it. I think next time mild will be my choice. Some places (native new yorker) consider mild to mean butter-sauce only. Yech. Mild is meant to refer to the HEAT. A butter-sauce does not define MILD-HEAT. A butter-sauce only defines NO HEAT! Anyway, the point is, the mild at ATL means MILD-HEAT (not just butter-sauce).  The biscuits are not what I would call biscuits. They are more like tiny Beignets or two-bite pastries. Just imagine a cinnamon-flavored donut hole, covered with powdered sugar, sitting in a shallow puddle of honey. Sounds good, right? SPOILER ALERT!!! It is!  I only have two minor complaints about this visit. The wings should have been served with celery to help cut the heat and refresh the palette between bites. Also, I wish they had a west-side-friendly location. Location is the real ONLY deterrent of dining here (especially if you live west of Central Ave.)  The total was $20, which is about right for a lunch for two and we certainly did not leave hungry!  On Tuesdays, you can get sixty-five cent wings if you sign up for their special offers by texting "ATL" to 60259.   ATL is not meant to refer to Atlanta (sorry, Atlanta airport!) ATL stands for All The Love.

*** B E W A R E ***    *** B E W A R E ***    *** B E W A R E ***      Our small business also received an 'invoice' from this company. Their address 2375 w. camelback rd, suite 600, is a 124 sq. ft. office space that can be rented by the hour to impress business clients. It is NOT the actual location of the company. A WHOIS report on their web-site shows false information - for example the website admin's name is literally 'website admin'  What a coincidence! Nothing on the front or the back of the invoice suggests that it is actually marketing materials. This is done to intentionally deceive the recipients.

My wife and I decided to try Venezia's tonight, since we just saw a promotion on ABC 15. We've never heard of it before. Got the address from their web-site, and my GPS says no such address exists! Apparently, this particular Venezia's has only been open for about two months. We found the place easily enough. It's a large building, hard to miss, really.   They have four flat screen monitors mounted in portrait mode to display all of their menu items and prices. Its the nicest menu-system of any restaurant (chain or otherwise.)  You walk up to the counter, place your order and pay for it. You'll get your drink cups and a number placard. Seat yourself. As I previously mentioned, this place is huge! (The restrooms, not so much. One person (of each gender) at a time with a locked door. So, the wait can be a while (depending on who's in there and why...)  There are two ice machines and beside each one is a tiny touch-screen Pepsi-products dispenser. Apparently, this is Pepsi's way of responding to those giant all-in-one touch-screen Coca-Cola machines? I touch the screen to get started, select Pepsi and then it wants to know what flavor i want to add. Four are listed - cherry, lemon, etc... I ignore those and push the dispense button. I must say, I am not a fan of these machines. All I want is a regular soda. Not diet, not rootbeer, not flavored! I imagine at least 75% who use these machines select 'Pepsi' or 'Coke', so why not have a button that takes you to the most common item selected instead and a different button to go through all those menu's?    The food was brought to our table. We started with an order of 'medium' chicken wings, and they really good. The sauce was closer to HOT than MEDIUM, so next time I'll order mild. They're served with some celery sticks and carrots and, of course, ranch dressing.   About half-way through the wings, they delivered our pizza to our table. A small pepperoni and mushroom pizza. They asked if there was anything we would like removed from the table (used plates, trash, etc...). That's a nice touch!  They claim the pizza is "New York Style" but New York is a big place and there are many different styles of pizza there. Most "New York Style" restaurants I dine at are nothing at all like restaurants in New York! But, I'm pleased to say Venezia's is truly New York style.  I don't like how they put the toppings under the cheese. Doesn't that make them underlings instead of toppings? TOPpings. TOP. T-O-P.... okay, I think I made my point on this one. The pepperoni doesn't get crispy because it's hidden beneath the cheese. It's hard to tell which pizza is which if you order different toppings on each one. Good luck with that treasure hunt!  That OCD aside, the crust was thin (not cracker-like, just thin) and the sauce was more like a marinara. I have a hard time describing the sauce. It's different and I can't decide if it's disgusting or my new favorite thing. This is a tough one. I'll have to process this by eating a few more pizzas and I'll follow-up here once I decide.  The edges of the crust and the top of the cheese were brown and had these little dark-brown areas showing if it cooked any longer, it'd be burned. That's how you cook a pizza! Everyone talks about the cheese, sauce, crust, atmosphere of the restaurant, prices, service, and NO ONE EVER talks about the art of knowing how to properly cook one. Trust me, it's a lost art, but its alive and well at Venezia's!  With a salad, our total was $29.00. I think it was fair for the price. I think we'll have to go back and try it again. Servers were all very friendly. The place is clean and it doesn't get too loud. Food came out within 10 minutes of ordering it - that's impressive! I just don't know about that pizza sauce, though...

This is a cheap knock-off of ATL wings. I imagine the owners must know each other because these unique restaurants that only serve wings and fries are a new concept.   I really wanted to like this place since it is closer to my house than ATL, but I did not like any of the flavors they offer for their wings. No medium? You should always offer the classics and yet, they don't. And what they consider mild just doesn't taste right. Its more of a Louisiana-inspired hot sauce than a Texas Pete's/Red Devil type of hot.  The french fries were excellent.  The store is so small, after eating there, my clothes were soaked with the smell of the deep fat fryers. I had to take those clothes off and put them in the washing machine right away, as they reeked so badly of the fryers it was even smelling up the clothes hamper. They definitely need to improve the ventilation. Prices were also a bit steep but the staff was super friendly and had a great attitude.

Just got back from Mulnati's and thought I would write about the experience. First, let me say I don't often give 5-star reviews because I'm afraid it can actually hurt the business, as it may set impossible expectations. However, in this case, a 5-star review is deserved for the reasons explained below.  First, let's talk about location. This is the first Mulnati's opened outside of Illinois. I appreciate they selected a central Phoenix location. I would have expected a Scottsdale location, or Chandler or Gilbert. Choosing an east side or west side location as their first Arizona location would have been a mistake, as it would be discouraging for someone living on the opposite side of town to make the drive. Being in central Phoenix means its about equally distant from everyone, regardless of what side of town you're on. So they get a star for that.  Knowing Mulnati's has only been open for a week, we knew it was going to be crowded and very busy. There was no way my wife and I were going to endure the experience on a Friday or Saturday night. Instead, we went on a Sunday. Knowing they would open at 4pm, we got there by 3:15 and about 40-60 people were already lined up. The weather wasn't too hot and we were in the shade. Surprisingly, they started seating people at 3:30pm. So, the line started to move. About 15 minutes later, the line moved again. That's when I noticed owner, Marc Mulnati, talking to people waiting in line. That's a real treat to see the owner there. Definitely worth a star!  They have outdoor seating, and if anyone was willing, they were more than happy to seat you outside, regardless of your place in line. We waited. It was our turn right at 4pm. We were then let into the restaurant where they took our name and our cellphone number and were told it would be about a 10 minute wait for a table for two. About 10 minutes later, they called our name. They asked if the high-top table in the lobby would be okay. I didn't want to sit there because there is a lot of foot traffic and people waiting for their names to be called to be seated. I said I'd prefer to sit in the dining area, as I don't want all these people standing around watching us eat. I was assured this was not a problem, and we were finally seated in the dining area.  I know from eating at Mulnati's in Chicago that these pizzas take about 40 minutes to cook AFTER you order them, so we ordered right away. My wife ordered the 'individual' house salad, and we ordered drinks and a small deep dish pizza with pepperoni and mushroom with the buttercrust, of course!  The 'individual' salad is huge and could feed 3-4 people. My wife is very particular about her salad dressing and was very skeptical that their vinaigrette dressing would be as good as they claim.  She was mistaken - and admitted it was awesome! (I don't eat salad so I can't say.)  My concern about the pizza was that it wouldn't be the same as I remember from Chicago. After all, the water in Phoenix is horrible, and while the recipe might be exactly the same, the difference in the water could make it taste completely different.   I'm happy to report they actually filter the water and when the pizza did arrive, it tasted exactly like it should! I also learned they have 28 pizza ovens in the back! And just like in Chicago, they serve Coke products (not Pepsi!) all of which earns them another star!  They had a lot of employees working! This was another concern I had, that employees would be stressed out dealing with the crowd and the service and quality of the pizza would suffer. All of the employees seemed calm and happy to be there and not stressed out or over-worked at all. I've never seen so many employees and upper-management asking if everything is okay. They really DO seem to care that you are having your expectations met and WANT to fix it if not. That's another star!  I don't feel this is an honest review unless I have some suggestions for improvement. I wish the pizza was served piping hot. It was served hot, but not like my experience in Chicago where you'd burn the roof of your mouth if you didn't wait. This tells me the pizza must have sat at the pass for a few minutes before it was served. Secondly, I'm sorry I ordered the mushrooms in the pizza, as they didn't cook at all. If the mushrooms were sauteed first, that would have made a difference or if they placed the mushrooms on top of the pizza.   But for the good news, the sauce is amazing. The crust is amazing. The cheese is amazing! And combined, it's better than sex! Seriously, they should install mirrors over the dining room tables! That's two stars on its own! Even the pans they cook the pizza in looked used and seasoned!   Total cost was less than $40 and we had to take home 3/4's of the salad and half a slice of pizza. (My mouth wanted to eat it, but my belly was full!)  Arrived at 3:15pm. seated by 4pm, paid the check and left at 5:05pm.  Dinner: $40  Meeting Marc Mulnati: Priceless!

Three flat screen monitors show the menu over the ordering counter (I love this!). They specialize in wings, so the menu is fairly limited. This is by design. The theory is rather than offer a ton of variety that is just 'okay,' they want to focus on one main item and do it really well! Therefore, the menu lists just chicken wings (bone-in or boneless), salads, fries, pancakes, biscuits and drinks. That is IT (apart from the ranch or blue cheese dressings/dipping sauces).  They have three different styles of wing - BBQ, HOT WING and DRY RUB. There are several flavor variations you can select under each style. We ordered 10 wings with the ATL dry rub and 10 wings medium. We also ordered two fountain drinks and an order of the biscuits. (Since this review they've added more flavors and we've tried their cheese fries which are AMAZING!!!)   We paid at the counter, they gave us our self-serve drink cups, wrote my name on the receipt, told us to sit anywhere we like and they would bring the food out to us shortly.  The fountain machine is Pepsi (its Coke at the 40th St location, so that's odd) and they also have tea (sweetened and un-sweetened)and three different flavors of Kool-Aid to choose from.  Just finishing filling our drinks and putting the lids and straws on our cups, when our order was being served! (Apparently, they pre-cook the wings about 3/4's of the way, then remove them.

SPOILER ALERT!!! It is!  I only have one minor complaint about this visit. The wings should have been served with celery to help cut the heat and refresh the palette between bites.  The total was $20, which is about right for a lunch for two and we certainly did not leave hungry!
