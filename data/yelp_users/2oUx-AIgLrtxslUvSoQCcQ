Hands down my favorite Chinese eatery in Arizona. I've been coming here for 7 years....the food is delicious & the staff is courteous. They remember your name & give you free tea with your meal. This place is my hidden little gem in the desert & definitely worth a visit.....xxoo!

This clinic always seems busy, places you on hold for a long period of time and the staff members are unprofessional. I have a beautiful teacup Maltese that I scheduled for her yearly exam and grooming appointment. When I came to the office on a Saturday morning for my appointment the receptionist asked me to spell my name several times & proceeded to tell me I was not in the "system" & their groomer was not available today. Also, prior to this my appointment- my previous appointment (which was to be on Friday) was canceled. This was a disappointment and true waste of my time. After this "non appointment" - I've reached out to other Vet Clinics in the area. I would recommend AppleWood Resort | Pet Clinic & Banfield Hospital (Inside PetSmart). You lost a client today Scottsdale Vet Clinic. I knew I shouldn't have come back here a 2nd time - my first appointment was a disaster too - way to expensive and the vet took my sweet Teacup Maltese in a back room of the clinic for shots. I asked if I could go with my dog - I was not allowed - only to hear my sweet Chloe-Fendi screaming in pain a few minutes later. I'm disappointed and would NOT recommend this Vet Clinic to any stranger, friend or family member! Note: The clinic called today to apologize for the "confusion". I'm sorry to hear about the groomers emergency situation, Rachel. Although, I've already made an appointment with another vet clinic and will not be coming back to your establishment with Chloe-Fendi.

Greetings. I would give this review a negative star if it was an option.  1. I've lived in Scottsdale for over 5 years and visited this car wash yesterday for the first time in a year. A lot of changes have been made to Prestige Car Wash within the past year because the car wash "merged" with another company.  2. Some of the changes are listed below:  - Extra charges for scents - No longer offer a free car wash after your 10th visit due the "merger". -No more washing the inside of the car without an expensive car wash "upgrade". - $20.00 car wash gets your exterior clean - will not wipe down the inside of your vehicle. $20.00 gets you a car wash and vacuum - nothing extra.  3. I was completely disappointed with the customer service from the car wash technicians. Do not waste your time and/or money at this car wash.  4. Whatever company you "merged" with - I would recommend some serious conference calls about these "changes". It's not fair to spend $20.00 and come back to your car being shiny on the outside and dirty on the inside. In fact, I asked a care wash attendant if he could wipe down my dashboard - he stated that it would cost "extra" money to have my car cleaned on the inside.  5. Overall, this will be a waste of your time and money. I do not expect this business to be open much longer with all the changes due to not offering coupons and/or free washes.  I will not be coming back here again and would appreciate a FULL refund!  Thanks!  Ps. In response to your message - these changes are not helpful and I will not be coming by again. My boyfriend handled everything for me - his family owns a well known car detail | maintenance shop in Central Phoenix. He re-detailed my car on Sunday and will be taking it to his families shop and| or detailing it for me moving forward.
