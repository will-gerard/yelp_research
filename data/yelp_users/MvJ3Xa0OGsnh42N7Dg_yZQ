My husband and I had a the best experience here! They were more than happy to mix any samples we wanted and suggested the perfect primer to get the true color from the paint. When we decided which color we wanted Brett remembered who we were and were so glad to hear that the primer worked great. He mixed the paint we chose fast and even offered to carry it to our car for us. We will always buy paint here from now on! At Home Depot they always seem so put out and inconvenienced when you need a paint mixed and they seem to not be knowledgable about the paint at all. Come here for all your paint needs, it's worth it!!

Save yourself some time and don't go here. So many good places around here and this place just isn't one.

Postinos is ALWAYS good! Consistently great service, great food, great beer and wine! It's the perfect place to go when the weather is great, their patio is awesome. But really it's great anytime!

Red mountain landscaping completely transformed my backyard! John is awesome! He is honest, reliable and very knowledgable. He came up with great ideas, like lights under steps and under the trees to make it look even better. Highly recommend!

We had a great experience with this company! I woke up on a Sunday morning to a hot house and searched yelp for a/c companies and called them because of their great reviews. I called them and the girl on the phone was very friendly and sent someone out and they were at my house in about an hour and a half..Robert came out and figured out we had a refrigerant leak. He fixed it temporarily but wasn't able to find the leak that day. Dustin came out a few days later and found the leak. He fixed it within about an hour. They are very honest and professional! They give you a 2 hour window and they are definitely there within that window! I will be using them in the future for sure! Highly recommend!

Update! Hopefully your air doesn't go out on a Sunday, because unless you're on their maintenance program they will not service you! I used to recommend them to everyone but that will stop!  I don't really know how to reply to a comment on here, but when its 110 outside waiting to fix the a/c till the next day is not really an option! I'm sure you wouldn't want to live in that heat for 24 hours either. I appreciated a call back (even though you had a pretty snarky tone about the fact that we had called several times trying to get someone on the phone) and the offer to schedule the next day (although again, not very helpful) but I will not be recommending this company to anyone in the future.

I had been wanting to try this place for so long and I'm so sorry it took me so long to do so!! The food is SO good! We got the Cajun combo which has the crawfish etoufee, chicken and shrimp gumbo and jambalaya...all of which were so rich in flavor and slightly spicy. YUM. We also got the fried sausage app and loved it. And do not skip the key lime pie for dessert...best key lime pie ever!!! Also they have a good selection of beers from Louisiana which is cool! We will be back SOON!!

Great alternative to every other fast food restaurant...the salads here are 10 times better than the salads at other fast food places and they have yummy smoothies and coffee! Getting your salad as a wrap is also delish and they're good size!
