I LOVE coming here for there pizza and wings! Oh did I mention the happy hour specials! Can't get over it! Great for Sunday football as well. Multiple TV's in the establishment so you can watch sport center highlights and the game at the same time!

I can't tell you how many time I've walked in here to get a new pair of rock revivals, but I haven't been asked once if I need help or even a welcome to the store. Going to stick with paradise valley buckle for now on.

I love coming here for margaritas! The atmosphere screams, relax and have a great time. You can never go wrong with taco Tuesday either. They have a great menu, my go to drink is the fish bowl because it's so worth it. It's a great place for groups to have fun as well.

Even when it looks like there is a long line, they are pretty quick! Everyone is always friendly at this location. It's my daily go to location!! The drive thru could have been a little more organized when they originally built it, but hey it's still a great place!

We been here so many times it use to be our "Sunday place" to go. But the service has been getting worse every time we go in. Yesterday we had gotten take out, the smallest portions I had every seen from here. Probably not going to be our "Sunday Place" anymore.

I la la la love this place!! Friendly front desk staff. Clean facility, nice groomers that help you when you have questions about your dog. There is nothing negative I could ever say about Posh wash! Every time I've taken my dogs in for grooming or self wash, always great customer service. Will always come back to Posh Wash!

I'm giving this a 2 (which breaks my heart) because the service that was provided wasn't great. I took one vehicle 2 days ago and have to take it back because they didn't even do the back hatch. They made it right by taking it and rewashing it. Which was fabulous if I might add, so I immediately brought my truck back because they earn my business. I'm looking at the interior of the vehicle and it's half way done. They wiped around the seat belt buckles (I paid extra to have to seats conditioned), didn't pull the arm rest done in the back seat to wipe that off. Only wiped half of the back bumper off, I have to say I'm disappointed. For the price you pay, little things like this shouldn't be an issue.

I use to LOVE coming to this place! I would even wait for a table on game days. But I'm sorry, when you can't even give me some what of a wait time and you tell me it's going to be awhile.... And you have tables that's need cleaning. That's not okay in my book. Then, the hostess gave attitude when I asked how long the wait would be, won't be going back there again!

So the waxers are amazing! Super friendly, but every time I get one I like they get a new job or move. And they always have new front desk girls, their customer service could definitely use some work. I've been here once a week for the past 5-6 weeks, I see at least one familiar face and they still haven't bothered to know my name. I also needed to schedule an appointment for next week, and wasn't even asked before she picked up the phone. Use to love this location, but I am going to start going to the Happy Valley location.

We walked in and there was some what if a wait saw that there was sitting in the bar area, and it's all open seating! The bartender was on it all! My hat is off to him, he was running around like crazy, but remembered everything.

This place is not helpful at all!! I was ordering a sub with just ham, mayo, and pickle on it (for a 6 year old), and I was told that wasn't possible. I then asked one more time just a ham sub with mayo and pickle. I was then told I can have a plain ham sandwich with mayo packets on the side. I had asked for pickles on it, ONCE again I was told that they can't so that... But they can give me a whole pickle.. BUT they can't cut it up. I would really love someone to example to me why they couldn't do that?! And on top of that all I got was attitude from the cashier. Great customer service, NOT! Place is a joke, hire new people. I'll be going to Jersey Mike's for now on. At least they are willing to do the little things!

Holy amazing!! My meal prep has never been easier! I come in get protein shake or fruit smoothie, pick up my preordered meal prep and I'm ready for my day! The girl that is always up front it's so sweet and always friendly! The food is great!! You have to try Rocky Balboa wrap! I can't get enough of this place, I use to drive all the way over to Scottsdale to get my meal prep but not anymore! Meals made easy!

Well, I'm not one for bad reviews but this is kind of a must. We've been here twice and got our order wrong both times we've been here. Then, even after the fact of bringing it to managements attention, we were being talked down to being told that we "ordered wrong". After waiting over 30 minutes for my "correct order" to come out I gave up. The only thing the manager did for us was take $10 off our bill. We appreciate your "professional courtesy" but we won't be visiting you again. We gave a another shot because your food was great, but no delicious entree is worth this stress or headache.

I also noticed that they have fresh coconuts to drink out of so if you like coconut milk, definitely a great place to get your Hawaiian dream on. Will definitely go back to this place more often!
