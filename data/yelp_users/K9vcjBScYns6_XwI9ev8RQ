We have been coming here for years and we have NEVER had a poor experience. I have kind of annoying order and the girls always remember it and start making it right away. They are always so kind to our children. In fact, we went in this morning (Saturdays are our bagel nosh day) and they brought over three sprinkle sugar cookies for them. Just because!  I will always recommend Bagel Nosh to our friends and loved ones. They never disappoint :)

Worst service we've ever received. Actually we didn't even get served. We sat for 25 minutes and not one person approached our table. We stopped the manager 15 minutes in and he brought us waters for our children and said he would speak to someone, no one came by. We finally just left our beers (we ordered from the bar) half full. I informed the manager and hostess about this and wasn't even offered an apology.  We have been coming here for years. The service has never been great but tonight sealed the deal we will NOT  back and we will tell all our friends and family of our experience.
