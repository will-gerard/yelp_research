I crave Ono from time to time.  I wish it was closer to my apartment.  I still swing by for some Chicken Katsu whenever I get the chance, because it is tasty and delicious and katsu sauce is addictive.  My boyfriend is more adventurous than me, and he literally always is in the mood to go here.  He especially enjoys the spare ribs, bbq combo, and the spam musubi.  We both love the macaroni salad...  I get why someone said there was too much mayo, and I guess by some standards it's a little plain, but that's what I like about it.  People who say the rice is boring are obviously right, but they're forgetting to put soy sauce or katsu sauce or whatever they want on it.  It's plain white rice, guys, what do you think it's going to taste like?    They also have these super tasty canned Hawaiian beverages at the counter that we both highly recommend.    Oh, and if you have a smaller appetite, definitely go for the smaller plate option.  My eyes tend to be larger than my stomach and I can never finish the full-sized katsu plate, but the smaller one is just right (actually still a little more than I can eat, usually) and it's only about $5.  Awesome.

Best. French Fries.  Ever.  Also they have great onion rings, fried zucchini, hot dogs...  I don't eat burgers really, so I can't speak to those.  I am obsessed with their tuna salad, though.  I never thought I'd be ordering tuna salad sandwiches regularly from anywhere.  Tuna salad has a tendency to be that unpleasant gray or pinkish color, and have a tinge of fishiness to it, if its not fresh enough.  That is never the case at Chicago Hamburger Co.  This might sound strange, but their tuna salad is the most pleasant pale green color I have ever seen.  It's because they put relish in it.  Lots of delicious relish.  I am in love with their sandwiches, and although I used to devoutly order Polish sausages & fries, I can't turn my back on my new love.  Not the first thing people think of ordering when they come here, but it's definitely worth a try.

My boyfriend and I are super broke right now, so we're taking advantage of our Groupon credits.  We were hungry, and 5 & Diner was one of the Groupon Now! options.  I was originally thinking fries and a patty melt when we decided on going there, but when we looked at the menu the breakfast food looked extra delicious, so I went for the waffle with strawberries, and my boyfriend got the country fried steak and eggs and a vanilla coke.  As I'm writing this, he asked me to specifically mention that the vanilla coke was super yummy, so I'm doing that now before I forget.  (I had a sip, and I can verify that he speaks the truth.)  My waffle hit the spot, it was a nice texture and the yummy sweet strawberry topping was just what I wanted.  My boyfriend cleared his plate, as well.  Our server was super attentive and friendly, and even gave my boyfriend his last refill to go so we could take it on the road with us.  All in all, a very positive experience, especially considering this type of diner usually has mediocre food.  We'll definitely be returning soon.  As a side note, I had been here once before a long, long time ago, and had the patty melt and that was awesome as well.    As a side side note, I don't know what the person who said the dining room smells like a bathroom is talking about.

I am addicted to Venezia's.  A while back, a coworker picked up a slice for me and I was not impressed.  I don't know what was wrong with me.    I re-tried Venezia's on my lunch break four days ago, and I have eaten there every day since.  I brought my boyfriend there, and he is obsessed as well.  I am boring and usually just get cheese pizza, but my boyfriend always gets the slice of the day and raves about it, whatever it is.  I also got the Combo B last night, a slice of pizza with a small salad and a drink, and the salad was impressively good.  The Balsamic dressing was excellent, too.  Everyone should try this place out.  The pizza slices are huge, delicious, and satisfying.

This is my go-to bar.  I'm not into the scene at places where there's a lot of loud, obnoxious frat boys.  Four Peaks isn't especially quiet, mind you.  They play pretty good music for the most part, and almost every time I've started to groan because of the song that just came on, someone who works there changes it.  The service is a little slow, usually, but I honestly don't care.  The food is amazing, and the beer...  oh, the beer.  I love the Sunbru for warmer days, and the Oatmeal Stout when its chillier out.  I always end up drinking a little more than I planned because they're so delicious, and that leads to me splurging on appetizers.  My favorite is the spinach artichoke dip.    All of their beers are worth trying, since they brew them there you're not going to get them anywhere outside of AZ, as far as I'm aware.  If you don't know where to start, for $9 you can order the sampler, and get a tiny glass of each kind of beer they brew, then decide for yourself.    Short version: good food, good beer, one-of-a-kind establishment, go, now.

Amazing wine list, fantastic pizzas with unusual toppings, and gnutella crepes for dessert.  It doesn't get any better.  Not to mention that the service is excellent and friendly, and the atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming, something that you don't usually experience in a place as hip as Cibo.  I get nervous going out to trendy places because I'm scared of getting dirty looks from rich people, but this was not my experience at Cibo.  Just sitting on their patio is a relaxing experience, what with the lovely foliage, glass of wine, and beardy waiter.  I always want to go back when I've got the cash.  Great for a date or special event.

I am a couscous addict, and this is my go-to place.  Everything I've tried here is wonderful, though, and I love the attached market.

My main problem with the Cornish Pasty Company is inconsistency.  I've had pasties that were simply divine, and I kept going back.  Once I started getting ones that were a little icky, I just assumed they were having an off day.  I stopped going after my boyfriend and I got sick.  I really want to like this place, and I do like some things about it.  The crust on the pasties is always fab, but the fillings are hit or miss.  I always got either the Oggie or the Pilgrim, and the Oggie was more consitently good.  Once I tried the Pilgrim, it became my instant favorite since is had turkey and stuffing inside, and came with cranberry sauce for dipping.  But like I said, their lack of consistency, as well as the fact that I got sick last time I went, has made me not want to give them any more chances.

The employees are for the most part very friendly, and right now they've got some sweet deals going on for candy.  2 sodas, 2 candies, and a popcorn for $5, or 1 soda, 1 candy, and 1 popcorn for $3.  Plus they give out free gift cards for pre-ordering movies and games.    They also have a new thing called Direct Access, where if there's a movie or game title that they don't have in the store, they can have it mailed to you within 2-3 business days for the same price as renting it in the store.  You can mail it back when you're done, or bring it back to the store for $3 off a movie rental or $4 off a game rental.  Sweeeet.

Okay, so I might be a total weirdo, but I wake up craving Pei Wei's fried rice some days.  There is very little I enjoy more than waking up hungry at 10 AM on one of my days off, logging on to Pei Wei's website, and ordering fried rice just the way I like it without having to explain it to anyone and risk them writing it down wrong.  I'm antisocial, so what?  Then, I know that when they open at 11 AM they will have my very special order of fried rice hot and ready waiting for me.  The portions are huge, so a $6-$7 order of fried rice can last me up to four meals, which is an awesome [if not exactly healthy] deal.    I don't really like much of their other food that I've tried.  There's some sort of curry dish that was nice, but I'm sticking to my fried rice with extra egg...  yum.

This is the some of the yummiest Chinese food I've had since moving to AZ, and absolutely the yummiest Chinese delivery I have had since moving here.  I've only found three or four places total that have delivered, and all of them have been mediocre or worse, except for Asia Lee.  Everything I've gotten from them is delicious; last time I ordered Szechuan Beef, Pork Egg Foo Yung, and the free Chicken Fried Rice that comes with any order of $15 or more.  I wasn't a huge fan of the pork that came with the Egg Foo Yung, but the egg patties themselves are savory and delightful.  The Szechuan Beef is my absolute favorite, and it made a great lunch when I reheated it the next day, as welll.  I've never been inside the restaurant, so I can't vouch either way for the last review, but honestly, why would I go to the restaurant when I can have all the yumminess delivered right to my door?

I love Dutch Bros!  I'm a dedicated punch-card holder, addicted to iced Kickers, which are their Irish-cream flavored specialty.  They're really rich though, just so you know what you're getting into before you take my advice.  They make it with cream, but you can also get it with less fatty milks (or soy milk).  If you want the full experience, get the cream though.    I also love that their prices are all in increments of $0.25, including tax.  It's just a nice touch.  :)

Today was my second or third time coming to Paradise, but I wouldn't call it that if I had a choice.  I ordered the Chicken Katsu, which is a favorite of mine when it comes to Hawaiian food.  I was disappointed that it was especially chewy, and that they served it with BBQ sauce instead of Katsu sauce.  It just didn't taste quite right.  The lady working there wasn't particularly friendly, either.  I'll just go to Ono next time I hear the call of Katsu.

One of the best places in Tempe to get a late-night snack that isn't horrible for you.  I'm guilty of not always (or even usually) going with the most healthy options, but the sheiftalia platter has got to be better for me than a burger and fries, right?  Their tzaziki is bomb, the sheiftalia is delicious and tender and juicy and coated in just the right amount of lemon-y-ness, and their pitas are thick and soft, the way they should be.  They're open 'til 3:30 AM, and they deliver.  If you love good food and like to eat at weird hours of the night, do it here.  You won't regret it.

Their specials menu is extremely misleading -- I went there on a Wednesday, and according to the menu you get "50 cent drafts with any entree."  So I ordered an entree and asked what they had on draft.  Apparently that wasn't specific enough, because my beers were $5 a pop.  The waitress played dumb, and when I spoke to a manager he treated me like an idiot for not asking for the "draft specials" rather than the drafts.  That language is nowhere on the menu.  He told me if I didn't want to pay that much, "we were going to have a problem."  He didn't even offer any sort of discount or anything, claiming that "he didn't write the menu."  I paid and left, and I'll never go back, simply because they're purposefully misleading and expect their drunk customers not to ask questions at the end of the night.   Also, the stalls in the women's restroom have no locks.  Charging five bucks for a plastic cup of beer, they should be able to afford to get that fixed.

Me and a friend ordered delivery through GrubHub, which was fine.  The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple.   My friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.  I am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING. I'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment.   For a $50 delivery order, I was extremely disappointed. Worst $50 I've ever spent on a meal.

Oh, what a wonderful experience.    My boyfriend and I were going a little nuts on Groupon yesterday (I think we purchased 3 different deals) when we discovered a Groupon Now! for Thai Buffet.  My boyfriend is a huge buffet fan, and we both love Thai food.  He got really, really excited and I couldn't say no, so we purchased our final deal of the day, went and ran some errands, and finished off at Thai Buffet.  We were the only ones there at that time, but we were a bit early for dinner and really late for lunch (I think we arrived around 4:15-ish).  The buffet is not your standard type of buffet where you serve yourself, but it is all you can eat.  Joann, the owner, described each of the dishes to us and piled our plates high with a variety of curries, as well as a bowl of soup and another plate of salad.  We couldn't say no to any of the dishes, they all looked super amazing.  And they were.  My favorite was probably the green curry; it wasn't as spicy as some green curries and it had green beans in it, which I love.  Everything tasted more homemade than "restaurant-y," for lack of a better descriptor.  I felt like I was in a Thai grandma's kitchen, and it was awesome.  As we finished our massive plates of food, Joann went back into the kitchen and prepared us bowls of coconut ice cream with mango, pumpkin custard, and sticky rice.  This might have been my favorite part of the meal, but it's hard to say because it was all so good.  I'm a total sucker for sticky rice, though.  Definitely will be back.  You get a great value for the price (even without a Groupon, the buffet is $9.99/person), with quality eats and very friendly service.
