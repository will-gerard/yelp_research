I have been going to the Paisley Violin for years, since it was on Roosevelt. It has always been a neighborhood favorite. Everything is fresh, homemade and delicious. From the daily soups to the sandwiches, the coffee and espresso, you can't go wrong. The service is always great, everyone is warm and wonderful. Don't be shy about the area, despite what you may think or hear, it is a nice neighborhood (I live blocks away) and things are changing fast.  And it is always great to patronize a wonderful, independent neighborhood business.

A great little place to see shows, very small, very intimate, a great setting for seeing a band. If a band you want to see is playing here, be sure to go, it doesn't get anymore up close and personal than this. There is no seating or alcohol, so if you don't mind standing and being sober, it is well worth it. The art here is some of First Friday's best, as far as I am concerned, leagues above all the other galleries. Be sure to stop and see the art here if you are out then.

This place is awesome. The Traditional restaurant as well as the deli style restaurant inside. The assortment of food items is amazing, too many good things to choose from. And the prices are great. It is a great experience, if you like Mexican food you must go and check it out. This is the closest thing to Mexico without being there.  After eating it is great to explore the rich colors and products in the market. And don't forget the Sunday brunch with tons of choices and lots of traditional entertainment.

This place is wonderful and at a great location, the Chinese cultural center. They have great Asian products, great selection and great prices. The products and packaging are beautiful, for the most part. It is the best place to go for fresh seafood (a lot of it is still alive!), the prices are very reasonable. If you are looking for that exact something like frogs legs, rattlesnake, sea cucumber, squid flavored chips or kidney flavored tofu, this is the place to go. The produce selection is great and very inexpensive. The bakery counter has great pastries and other items. It is a great place to just experience.

Great English pub with great food, beer and atmosphere.  We have spent many a night here, even a few New Years Eves, which was a lot of fun. They have a great beer selection, their food, mostly traditional English fair is really good, some of the best fish and chips in town. The staff is courteous and friendly, as are the patrons. The place is decorated with a lot of wood, English football banners and scarves, TVs with football (soccer) playing and both tables and booths, other than the bar. There is a dining hall next to the main room, a few pool tables and jukebox and nightly events.  G&D is always a great time, one of the best places to meet up with friends for dinner and drinks.

I have only had the pizza delivery from here, but damn, was it good. Not cheap, over $40 to feed four us, but well worth it. It was hot, it tasted fresh, the ingredients were great. We had the chicken alfredo pizza, which I was skeptical of. Alfredo has a tendency to be rich and over used. But it was a perfect balance. Absolutely wonderful. The Queen Margherita pizza was awesome also. Again the ingredients were fresh and flavorful and the cheese was awesome (they use buffalo mozzarella). I say pizza is like sex. And this place is one helluva orgasm.

Sun Cyclery is awesome, I cannot believe no one has reviewed it yet with the growing popularity of bikes, especially in the downtown area. Sun Cyclery is the place to go. They have parts and accessories like heavy duty inner tubes, alloy wheels, mirrors, headlights and seats. Everything you would need or want to customize your bike. Their bike selection is everything from lowrider bikes to BMX bikes and mountain bikes to vintage and repro Schwinns. So whether you are fixing up your bike or looking for the latest Virve Paul Frank bike, or just need a part, Sun Cyclery probably has what you are looking for. And if they don't, they can get it for you.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, eager to help you or chat about bikes. They fix and repair bikes on the spot, as well as maintenance. They are also an authorized Schwinn dealer.

Trader Joe's is awesome.  A great selection of independent, organic and healthy choices. From Trader Joe's own brand of products, to organic produce and meats, specialty items, micro brew beer and wine, to the packaged and frozen food, to flowers and vitamins, it is the perfect place for the health conscious and thrifty. The staff is always friendly and helpful. If you have never been to Trader Joe's, it is a must see. This location is great, really crowded on the weekends and evenings, but what you lose in time you save in price.

I have always had great service at this store. Everyone has always been really friendly and I have had only great experiences. Yes it is usually busy and really crowded, but you can make appointments on line by looking up the store on the internet and making a reservation. They have lots of computers, laptops, iPods, gizmos and gadgets to check out and play with. The sales staff is really knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. Granted I have only gone in here for repairs and to browse. I make my purchases from apple or online, it is a helluva lot cheaper. The sales staff was nice enough to point me in the right direction for service from Mac Media or purchases online. Go check it out and enjoy.

I love Chipotle. This location, though not as good as the one on Camelback, for whatever reason, is still great. The food always tastes fresh and the ingredients are the above standard. The design of the great, simple, modern and ergonomic. Chipotle uses only natural meats, not factory farmed hormone injected animals. And some of the beans are organic.  Although the menu choices seem limited, burrito, tacos or bowl, the combinations are endless with the different types of meat, beans, salsas, etc. The menu is more than accommodating to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. They serve domestic and Mexican bottled beers as well as fountain drinks. The portions are huge, the burritos could easily be mistaken for a newborn baby wrapped in tin foil. No matter how long the line is, which it is usually really long, you will get your food fairly quickly. It is refreshing to have a business that actually cares and at the same time serve an amazing product.

I have been shopping at former NHL goaltender Randy Exelby's store(s) for more than 10 years now and I can't say enough good things about them. They have the best selection, best prices and best service.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful and always willing to give you a great deal. There is no other place I would go. I wish that all retail could be this great and this cool.

This place is an amazing experience of sight, sound, smell and taste. It is like an international convention whenever I visit. They have products from everywhere, not just Asia, like Holland, Jamaica, Brazil, India, Central and South America. I bought some beer from Lebanon here (their beer selection rivals AJ's).  The produce is fresh and really inexpensive with more choices than you can imagine. There is a deli, fresh seafood, in some cases so fresh it is still alive, beer and wine (saki and other), cooked meats, frozen foods, packaged products, cookware and utensils, and an entire aisle of every kind and flavor of ramen you can imagine, and guaranteed to be the best you will ever have. I can't say enough good things about this place. It is worth visiting for the experience if nothing else. I make the trip to shop there from central Phoenix and fight the weekend crowds, but it is well worth it!

Ok, I admit it. Ever since Hana Japanese Eatery opened up near me I have become a sushi snob. But, we had been to Ninja a couple times before and it wasn't bad. They are reasonably priced and have specials. The staff is nice and friendly, decent atmosphere, fairly intimate and dark, a little loud sometimes, but ok. So we were ok with it when our friends invited us out to Ninja for dinner. They say the third time is the charm.  Well, this time it wasn't. The sushi was bland with a lot of rice. Too much rice. It was just about all you could taste. Mussel, calamari, tuna, etc., it almost all tasted the same. I had a hard time getting my mouth around some of the pieces. The rolls, too, we are rice, with about a third of the center being the ingredients.  Before Ninja was not bad. But this time it was.

This place has great food and great prices. A nice change from the typical Scottsdale fair and not your typical "hole in the wall" restaurant.  It is clean, the staff is friendly, always the same guys there. The menu is large, serving both traditional Mexican food as well as Burgers and fries and combinations of both. The portions are big and the prices are small. Everything tastes fresh and great. FYI- The place is packed at lunch time with high school kids. There is usually a place to sit, but for whatever reason (the food, perhaps?), it seems to be the new daytime hangout.

Scottsdale Gun Club is an amazing facility. 30,000 sq. ft. of Indoor shooting ranges, store and even a tactical shoot house. The facility is very nice, clean and you feel very safe despite the arsenal of weapons and ammo around you. The store selection is amazing and some of the lowest prices and best selection around, even compared to online sales. It is weapon heaven. They have handguns, rifles, knives, accessories, clothing, protective gear, gun locks and safes, scopes, lights, you name it, they probably have it. They offer memberships of multiple levels and give discounts to law enforcement and military personnel. The shooting ranges are really nice and top notch, it is highly rated by industry critics. You can rent Uzis, Tommy Guns, fire a .50 cal from the top of a Humvee or rent your standard pistol or rifle. This place is amazing, a great time for both the novice and experienced alike.

Save your time and money, unless  you are going for the appetizers and drinks. The appetizers we had were really good, but our main course was sub-par and nothing spectacular. How do you screw up fish and chips? They managed and served the most mediocre crab cake I have ever had. Unfortunately, this place is nothing special, mediocre at best.

Obviously there have been a lot of great reviews of Ted's here. And this is not one of them. I was not blown away by my hot dog with mustard, onions and relish. It was ok. Honestly, I have made better ones. The relish tasted like the stuff out of the jar and the hot dog's flavor was nothing spectacular. Their fries are good, better than average. The onion rings are good, too, and better than average. The place has a great feel to it. From the food counter where you order and see your food prepared, to where it is handed off and they put whatever you want on your hot dog, sauerkraut, mustard, relish, onions, etc., to the memorabilia on the wall and the awards from the mid-80's for best hot dog place. But, I have to say, sorry Ted, it just wasn't that great. I would go back and eat there again, after all it wasn't bad. But I am not going to miss it if I don't make it back there ever again. There are plenty of places I have had a better dog, including Trader Joe's Fearless Franks grilled at home. Call me a hot dog snob, but Ted's just didn't cut the mustard.

Great little (maybe I should say really little) Irish Pub with great food. If you are a Jameson Irish Whiskey fan like me, this is the place. They serve 18 year old Jameson and it is amazing. The fish and chips are really good, too. They have a good beer selection, one you would expect from an Irish pub. There are live bands that play traditional Irish music, a cozy dining room and patio tables and chairs right outside if you prefer to smoke and drink. The service has always been good and the staff is pretty friendly. Parking is a little tough sometimes since it is right downtown. Seamus' is always a great time, friendly crowds and great drinks.

This cool, swanky, text book definition of hole-in-the-wall bar is the best. The oldest bar interior in Phoenix, it has the original 1950-something Tiki interior. It is dark and cozy, but not stuffy. The patrons are a mixed bunch, local grubby older guys who ride their bikes there, local business people who know what is hip, rockabilly, punk rock, hippies, young, old, Mexican, American, you get the idea, it is an eclectic mix. The pool table is always being used, the bar nearly always full, but you can usually find a stool and a table or sit at one of the booths. The two bartenders are a little rough around the edges, but both women are real sweethearts. And the prices are lower than anywhere except home. But you won't get the cool Tiki interior or great people watching there. I like in a neighborhood close to the Bikini, so we frequently take a walk over for some drinks. The Bikini is always a good time. I recommend it if for nothing else, the experience and the nostalgia. Not much of what Phoenix was before the strip malls and subdivisions, so it is nice to have this little piece of history still going strong (quietly, but strong). The one thing I would recommend against is going on First Friday, unless you plan on getting there early, the place gets packed. Really packed.

Don't be put off by the appearance. The great little cash only restaurant has some of the best beans, rice and salsa I have had (I know that many will refute this). The menu is what you would expect, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. all at a great price, as well as lunch and dinner specials that can't be beat. There is only outside seating, on a make-shift patio. There is the occasional loiterer who will ask for change or food, so it is best for take-out and to-go orders. But eating there is not bad. It is right around the corner from me and part of my neighborhood. There are always people there, and having eaten there often, I know why. My only complaint is they are cash only.

After craving Chinese food and checking Yelp for someplace close to home, we decided to try Maxim since it has had such great reviews. And, like most of the time, my fellow yelpers were right on. Maxim serves both Vietnamese and Chinese food. The majority of the menu is Vietnamese, like Pho and the vermicelli noodle dishes, and they have Chinese food for lunch specials, like Kung Pao chicken.  I got a bowl of the Pho, which was big enough to swim in, and my girlfriend got one of the vermicelli noodle dishes, which could have fed us both, and we shared hot tea. Our meals and drinks were $12. The food was good, the service was great and the portions are huge! We have at least another meals worth of leftovers. So if you like Asian food and are looking for a good meal for a great price, check out Maxim. You will be happy and full - Pho Yeah!

Shooter's World is a decent range to go shooting. The staff is nice, friendly and knowledgeable. The facilities are decent and currently being renovated. We go during the week and never have a problem getting a lane. Friday night is Ladies' Night, range fees and rental fees are waived, so women only have to pay for the target and ammo. It's a great time to check it out or introduce yourself to firing a weapon. But get there early and be ready for the crowds. Needless to say, the handgun rentals go fast, so selection can be limited.   The pricing is fair, from range fees to ammo, to memberships and classes. They offer a lot of courses and educational classes on site.  They have a good selection of handguns and rifles, accessories, holsters, ammo, as well as other self defense products and clothing for sale. They carry most major manufacturers, like Glock, Sig Sauer, Kimber, Springfield Armory, Bushmaster, etc. The same is true for the selection of rentals.  It's no Scottsdale Gun Club, but it is a good place to go. I am a member and have no complaints.

I recently got tattooed at Crawling Squid by Evan Barry.  The facilities are super clean, the staff is super friendly and make you feel comfortable and right at home. My tattoo was a traditional tattoo done in the traditional "Sailor Jerry" style, which Evan Barry excels at. He was patient, asked if and when I needed a break, and it was really comfortable and pleasant, as pleasant as getting a tattoo could be. It was obvious from the meticulous way he worked that he wanted the tattoo to be perfect. And it was! I now have an amazing tattoo, which I got at a really great price, and had a really great experience. I'm already contemplating the next piece and am excited to head back to Crawling Squid for more great work. Whether it's your first tattoo, or like me, you're getting more, Crawling Squid is the place to do it.

Dr. Battersby is awesome.  I admit I have a deep mistrust of the health care industry (key word, industry) and pharmaceutical companies. But Dr. Battersby is the exception to the rule. He will work with you if you are uninsured or out of your insurance's network. He listens to you. He explains things to you in a clear and concise manner. He gives you choices. He doesn't try and solve your problems with a pill. He is that ideal of what a physician should be. And if that is not enough, he is a chiropractor, too.

Wow. I thought there was no such thing as bad pizza until I went to LJ's. I have never seen greasier pizza. We could end the fuel crisis if we could get cars to run on this grease. A large cheese pizza would probably get you to the moon and back. The ingredients were horrible. Obviously, the cheese is cheap, the pizza glistened orange and yellow from the grease and cheese. The mushrooms were obviously canned. The sausage looked more like ground beef, maybe it was. There was even some sort of taco pizza with what looked like Doritos on it. Not really sure what to make of that. The pizza is floppy and soggy, too, cut in long thin slices, no more than a few inches wide. After a few slices I wished I had had more of the salad bar. Either that or I should have wrung out or wiped down my pizza. It felt like the grease was separating from everything else in my stomach. Not a good feeling.  The crazy thing is this place was packed! There were large groups coming in constantly, always a line to wait to be seated. This I can't figure out. Yeah the staff is attentive and super friendly, but the food, the grease, the ingredients - unbelievable. Obviously people loved this place. I didn't. It was some of the worst food I have ever had. And I can't say enough about f*ing up pizza, I didn't think it was possible until I came here.

I am not sure what I am supposed to get out of the magazine, if anything. Behind the sometimes really cool covers seems to be only ads and pictures of the valley's finest at the cool spots and clubs looking their best. But I guess the best way to sell a magazine to your target market is to put their picture in it. I have read a couple of good articles in 944, but for me, the magazine lacks content and substance and I am not really sure why it is produced.

This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to in the valley. It has great reviews from critics and some famous clientle that frequent the restaurant. The location is great for an artsy-evening since it is right by the performing arts center and the modern art museum. It is quiet and intimate, a great menu and food. Each experience has been wonderful, both the food and the service.

This place is amazing. I have yet to have something there that I did not love and I have been there plenty of times. The food and experience is wonderful, there are plenty of meat and vegetarian options on the menu and the way it is served will make everyone happy.  The food is brought to you on a plate on top of injera, a flat, spongy, moist bread with a taste similar to sourdough. Pieces of injera are torn off and used to scoop/grab bites of the portions, no silverware. They have traditional Ethiopian drinks and liquor, too. They have lunch specials where the portions are served wrapped burrito style, which was my first experience and absolutely amazing. Cafe Lalibela is a must, something wonderful to experience, a delightful culinary peek into another country and culture. You won't be disappointed.

It doesn't get any better than this, dining where Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe did. And it looks the same as when they were there. This is fine dining at it's best and worth every penny (lots and lots of them). There is a reason they have been around for over 50 years and they are always crowded (which is pretty amazing since it is really easy to spend $100 or more on dinner for two). The food was spectacular, as was the service. The water they serve is bottled Perrier. The menu choices are expected, steaks, seafood, etc., but the food is exquisite in both preparation and taste. Best damn $10 martini I have ever had. This is a great place to go for a special occasion, an intimate evening or celebration. It is a trip back in time to an almost forgotten era, a place to experience great food and fine dining, one you will soon not forget.

I am probably wasting my time with this review, seeing as there are well over 100 reviews. But, I have to because I really wonder why all the hype. Yeah, the food is really good. But, the portions are small and really, really pricey. You get half as much as you would expect at twice the price. Not to mention they tout the chef and menu being inspired by her childhood in southern Mexico. So when I ordered my entree and the waitress asked me would I like fries or salad with it, needless to say I was more than a bit surprised. What? Did she grow up in Mexico having fries with her tacos?  The place is tiny and incredibly noisy. You don't have a conversation there, you have a shouting match. And it is full of forty and fifty-something urban and hip upper middle class. (Although, is there a middle class anymore?) Not that there is anything wrong with that, I think it just speaks to the the food, prices and atmosphere.There is barely enough room to navigate and the near misses between the staff and the customers are something to see. Again, the place is not bad. I would probably like it a lot more if it were a lot less expensive. But, I think the Barrio Cafe is more hype than anything else and I don't think they deliver.

This place has amazing food, separate menus for lunch and dinner and a full bar. There is dining inside or on the patio. I think the entire staff is Italian and you can usually hear conversations in Italian between the staff and customers, adding to the ambiance and authenticity. The Northern Italian cuisine is truly amazing, the staff is always warm and friendly. The meals start out with a few kinds of bread and dipping sauces and vinegar and oil. I could go just for that. There are plenty choices for vegetarians and carnivores alike. Menu: http://www.venetotrattoria.com/menu1.html I highly recommend it!

I love living so close to Burton Barr Central Library.  Five stories of books, millions of titles, it is heaven. Not to mention their CD collection, you will be hard pressed not to find something cool. I have checked out hundreds of CDs from here, everything from Mogwai to Charlie Patton box sets. It is a great resource for music, something I don't think a lot of people realize. (Be sure to check out the teen section on the 4th floor, that is where most of the good CDs are.) Their website has been redone, so now you can place holds (3) online and save items to your "Bookshelf" for future reference or to check out later. They will transfer your hold request to your location, too. The employees are all pretty friendly and very helpful, when you need it. I can't forget to mention the rare book room, the Arizona Room, full of archived Phoenix/AZ/Southwest history, and the many ongoing events and art gallery. Sometimes outside there are people wanting you to sign this or that petition, or the occasional person asking for change, but more often than not, you can walk in unmolested. I can't say enough good things about it.

This store is awesome. They have a great selection of Middle Eastern groceries and products, teas, rice, spices, meat, bread, olives, boxed and canned items, juices, sodas, it is an amazing array. The produce is great, fresh and really inexpensive. There is an on site butcher, something you rarely, if ever, see anymore. There are great deals on fresh, yes fresh, chicken, lamb, goat, beef, fish and more. The restaurant/bakery has an array of amazing and tasty items like hummus, flat bread pies, shawarma, falafel, amazing pitas, small pies, all fresh, made on the spot for ridiculously low prices. The small pies, similar to a turnover with either meat or vegetables, are less than a dollar each and good enough to eat a dozen! If you are a fan of Arabic and Middle Eastern food and/or products, this is the place to go. Or, even for the cultural experience, Baiz Market is well worth the trip.

First off, I have to admit most of the times I have been here is on First Fridays, which is why it gets four stars. Not that it is their fault that it is so ridiculously crowded that you can hardly walk through the place and not be in someones way, but, maybe they could make it more accommodating. If I could enjoy their drinks and food without having to worm my way through way too many people and stalk a table or counter or any place to sit and enjoy my food, it would be perfect. The ambiance is nice, a little dark, hardwood floors, the refurbished house is hip and well-done. Music is piped into every room and the volume is just a little too high. There is a wooden deck out back if you want to smoke. The beer and wine list is great. I have yet to have something I didn't like. The micro-brew and local beers are rich and tasty, served ice cold. The food is absolutely amazing, possibly the best grilled cheese and tomato soup on the planet and the honeymooner is incredible, as is the cheese plate. So if you don' mind being elbow to elbow with the psuedo-hip artsy fartsy new bohemians, The Roosevelt is well worth it. Better yet, go on an off day, like a Tuesday for better luck. The beer, wine and food will not disappoint.

I must have driven by this place a thousand times. But we finally ended up their last night. And I am glad we did. The restaurant has existed for 50 years in that location. It has changed ownership many times but survived the usual modernification of Phoenix. After eating there, I can see why. Bread and olive oil with herbs to start. A great wine list, full bar and and a three page menu. The pasta dishes are traditional, classic, seafood, as well as other meats. And there are pizzas, sandwiches, calzones and daily specials, too. Everything tastes homemade and fresh. Definitely something for everyone, vegetarians, kids, etc. The waiter was friendly and attentive. We had no problem getting seated at 7:30 on a Friday night (after our first choice was an hour wait). Our host was kind enough to move us to a window seat, too. The interior is dark and nice, giving it an upscale feel. The patrons were a diverse group, young, old, straight, gay, couples, families, one of the waiters has a mohawk and was serving a guy with his head tattooed. The food was really good, I look forward to going back again.  One of central Phoenix's gems right out in the open, don't be like me and drive right by. Come in and enjoy, you won't be disappointed.

This place is a cool, little independent place to find great stuff. They have a lot of products, collars, toys, food, etc., all of it hip and/or healthy. It is a little pricey, but like they say, you get what you pay for. The people are wonderful. We frequent the Wag N' Wash for not just bathing our dogs, but for their food, toys, etc. It is well worth a visit and you will see why people come back again and again.

Mucho gusto es much malo, mucho dinero por much nada. Our order: 2 fish tacos, comes with salad $14. 2 chicken tacos, comes with salad $12. A second round of chips is an extra dollar. The food was ok, but at those prices should have been spectacular or at least filling. If only if is was possible to review somewhere and give them no stars. Mucho Gusto would be it.

Zia never seems to have what I am looking for. They do have a large selection of new and used, cassettes and videos and DVDs. But I am almost always disappointed when I go there, not being able to find what I went there for. You can sell CDs and movies there, too. But there is such a large volume of used and so many people doing it that there is usually a long wait and the pretentious staff is pretty picky. It is worth a look, though, browsing through the large amount of used CDs and movies, sometimes there is a deal too good to pass up.

I am a local and wanted something cool to do for my fiance's birthday and a friend recommended the Valley Ho. And I am glad she did. We stayed in the studio guest room, she had a massage at HV Spa and we had dinner at Cafe Zuzu, all of which were wonderful. Our room was huge, private patio, decent view, comfortable bed and furniture. Not only do you get shampoo, bodywash, the usual, but even Qtips. There are your standard water glasses as well as martini and wine glasses. These little extra touches made it all the more enjoyable and worth the price. The hotel is one of the coolest that I have ever stayed in. It is in pristine condition, everything is immaculate and sheik, the decor and design is  a perfect combo of retro and modern that compliments the feel of the hotel. The staff is helpful and out of their way friendly. It is upscale without being pretentious, trendy without being cheesy and an amazing experience that I would recommend to both visitors and locals alike. The one negative is a $12 parking charge, as other reviewers have mentioned.

Fattoush is an amazing little place, family run with wonderful fresh, homemade tasting food. Seriously the best hummus I have ever had. The prices are great, you can have an amazing lunch under $10. The menu is pretty broad with a lot of traditional dishes from lamb to fava beans to hummus. Vegetarians can find plenty of choices. Never having been to the Middle East, I am not sure of the authenticity of the food, but if I were to guess, this is what it would be like to eat a home cooked meal there. The staff is friendly and helpful and the service is great. Most of the people eating there are Middle Eastern each time I have been there, which I think say something about the quality and taste of the food. The place is great, you can't beat the price and better yet, you can't beat the taste.

I know, I know, another rave review for St. Francis.  Why bother, you might wonder? Because St. Francis is worth another 5 star review. And I'm sure they'll get many more. The restaurant is great inside, exposed brick, stainless steel tables, outside bar and dining as well as the inside dining room and the upstairs loft style area. The staff is genuinely friendly and helps keep the place from going from hip to pretentious, clad in their white t-shirts and jeans. The food. Oh, the food. St. Francis must be the patron saint of deliciousness, the best food you might have ever had. The menu is sparse and simple, A couple chicken, beef, fish, vegetarian options. But once you experience the food you realize there is no need to be any more elaborate. So many adjectives come to mind, exquisite, phenomenal, amazing, and they're all accurate. So do yourself a favor. Don't take it from me and the all the other yelpers, go to St. Francis and experience the immaculate mastication. After all, eating is believing.

My first experience with Boba left me unsure, but now I am a die-hard fan. It is a great experience of texture and flavor and something you have to try to understand, explaining it just sounds weird. This place is quaint and friendly, with a great variety of drinks and interesting appetizers, both meat and vegetarian. They have something for everyone, even if you are not adventurous enough to try the boba. There are tables and soft, comfy couches to hang out and wait or enjoy whatever you order.

This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town. They have the usual/expected menu, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc., at really reasonable prices. In the years that I have been going there the food has always been delicious and everyone I have taken has been won over.  The staff is friendly and attentive, I have always had really good service. I can't say enough about La Canasta. This place is awesome. Two things, though, the dining room closes at 7 pm and they don't do separate checks.

This is some of the best sushi I have ever had, obviously fresh and made to perfection. The taste was rivaled only by the presentation, the Caterpillar Rolls looked like a caterpillar, complete with sprout antenna and octopus sucker eyes. My Calamari looked like a little squid was so fresh and tender it nearly melted in my mouth. The menu has a lot to offer for non-sushi lovers, too. The service was great, four servers despite the place being small and having only about 10 or 12 tables. Highly recommended!

This place is heaven, the Valhalla of alcohol. Tons and tons of choices, beer, wine, Scotch, Cognac, Whiskey and Bourbon, Vodka, Tequila and lots of other things you or I have probably never seen or heard of, like the Danish alcohol with Cocoa leaves. 18 year old Jameson? Georgia moonshine? $20 six pack of beer? Icelandic Vodka? Ouzo? Cigars? Cheese? Olive juice for martinis? They have it all. Nearly every country and every spirit is represented here. You will be hard pressed to not find what you are looking for, in fact, you will find more. Depending on what you buy, the prices are great. There is a reason BevMo is popping up all over the valley. The only bad thing is I wish I thought of it first.

This place is awesome, exactly what Phoenix needs.  They have cool clothes by local and hip vendors, like RVCA. They have tshirts, jackets, hats, dresses, jewelry, all things that you won't come across just anywhere. That is the great thing, it is independent and not your run of the mill clothing store, the stuff is actually cool. Not to mention is a locally owned. The prices are high, but hey, it is stuff you won't find just anywhere and I don't feel bad about supporting a local business that is part of a great cultural change in downtown. Drop in on First Friday and check them out.

R.I.P. Baghdad restaurant. It is now a Kabob restaurant that is good, but not as good as Baghdad was.

I am glad this place is now in my neighborhood, it is great to have Thai food so close to downtown. The restaurant is a former greasy spoon American style diner, complete with a counter and booths, the kind of place you would picture Mel and Flo. The food is really good, not the best Thai food I have ever had, but still really good. And the prices aren't bad, either. The staff is friendly and helpful and, of course, almost all Thai. They seem genuinely happy to have you visit and have your business. The serve a great Tom Yum soup. The menu has traditional Thai dishes as well as some Chinese and like most Thai restaurants you can choose your meat or tofu. The place is great. Give it a try.

The coffee was good. I had the two egg breakfast and asked for toast instead of bacon. I got bacon (and no toast) and reminded the server I asked for toast instead. I was almost done by the time I got my toast. The portions were small. Really small. The plates are smaller than average. (I am not one for huge portions, but c'mon, I have seen child's portions bigger than this!) The hashbrowns were unremarkable. The bacon had a smokey flavor that tasted like your clothes smell after being around a campfire. The eggs were ok. The meal barely filled me up. Maybe I got the wrong thing. Or maybe I am crazy to expect an $8 breakfast to be spectacular (or filling). When it is almost $40 for breakfast for three people it better be damn good. And this wasn't.

I was a loyal Papa John's customer for quite a while. I would order pizza for delivery from this location on a regular basis. Good/decent pizza at a great price. Of course, I would never tout Papa John's as the best pizza in town or anything, but hey, it is/was cheap and pretty good.  Not anymore.  The pizza got worse and worse as time went on. It gradually declined from a great pizza at a great price to a "What the cuss happened to this pizza"? Finally, after the last pizza I had delivered, which was undercooked and looked like someone literally threw skimpy toppings in clumps, I had enough. So, I sent a complaint to customer service, which, they say, is World Class Customer Service. Not sure which world that is, because after almost a month, I've heard nothing from them.  Papa John's is a dead beat dad. They obviously don't care about the customer, nor the quality of the product. Who's your daddy? It's definitely not Papa John's.

I cannot believe that I haven't reviewed Stacy's yet. This place is amazing. You will be convinced as soon as you step out of the car and smell the smoking meat filling the parking lot with a salivating aroma. It is small, sparse decor, skimpy tables and chairs, but the food makes up for it. The fried chicken, made fresh when you order so it takes a while, is probably the best that I have ever had. The bbq sandwiches are awesome, too. The fried okra and fried pickles are fantastic. The menu is extensive, bbq sandwiches, bbq ribs, chicken, beef, pork, fried catfish and fried chicken. There are a ton of sides, okra, beans, collard greens, mashed potatoes, fried pickles and more. It is way too hard to order just a couple. And you can wash it all down with some sweet tea, or Kool-Aid or an Orange Crush in a bottle. If you are still hungry, you can have some red velvet cake or another homemade dessert. For some bad ass southern comfort food, it doesn't get any better than this. Forget about all the other bbq places. Stacy's is the only one you need to know. And bring cash, no debit or credit cards are accepted.

This place is the best BBQ I have had so far in the valley. The menu has something for everyone everyone, pulled chicken, pork, fish, burgers, brats, hot links, even veggie burgers. And so many wonderful sides, all homemade, baked beans, red beans and rice, mac n' cheese, cornbread, black eyed peas and more! They have fresh squeezed lemonade, too. And the BBQ sauce, available in mild and spicy, is good enough to drink! The staff is super friendly, always plenty of room to sit or take your order to go. This place is a gem with it's heavenly elixir of BBQ.

I love Chipotle. The food always tastes fresh and the ingredients are the above standard. The design of the great, simple, modern and ergonomic. Chipotle uses only natural meats, not factory farmed hormone injected animals. And some of the beans are organic.  Although the menu choices seem limited, burrito, tacos or bowl, the combinations are endless with the different types of meat, beans, salsas, etc. The menu is more than accommodating to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. They serve domestic and Mexican bottled beers as well as fountain drinks. The portions are huge, the burritos could easily be mistaken for a newborn baby wrapped in tin foil. Don't be put off by the lunch line. No matter how long the line is, which it is usually really long, you will get your food fairly quickly. I have spent many lunches here when the line was nearly out the door I was still in and out in a reasonable time. It is refreshing to have a business that actually cares and at the same time serve an amazing product.

The place is great, the merchandise is quality and very reasonably priced. I paid $10-$15 more for my OBEY shirt at some stupid corporate chain. They have a lot of unique items, shirts, etc. that I have not seen anywhere else. The store is small and intimate and comfortable. Cool stuff for a cool cause. And the staff is super friendly and down to earth. Enough said.

I pledge allegiance to the Sweet Republic and the deliciousness for which it stands, one location with so many flavors, with something amazing and incredible for all.  I cannot say enough good things about Sweet Republic. How sweet it is. I don't think you can go wrong here. If corn flavored ice cream is one of the best things I ever tasted, how can one go wrong? Whatever Helen, one of the owners and the genius behind the incredible array of flavors, tells me to put in my mouth I will.   From the traditional Vanilla Bean to the unconventional Corn flavor, there is definitely something for everyone. The ingredients are top of the line and it comes through in the flavors. All the ice cream is made on the spot.  The decor is cool, well-designed, comfortable, friendly and eco-friendly wherever possible. The service is great, the staff is nice. So don't hesitate, the ice cream here is not only full of wonderful flavor, but it is a wonderful experience as well.

Rather than continuing to repeat what is said in the other reviews, if you like Middle Eastern food, you'll love Al-Hana. It is fresh - made on the spot with Halal meats and fresh produce, the breads, wraps and pies all made from scratch and cooked there. It is inexpensive - the little pies start at 69 cents and most of the sandwiches are under $5. You can easily feed two for about $10. And it is good - all the fresh, homemade ingredients really come through in the flavors and textures, tasty meat, warm bread, crisp, fresh produce. I am definitely going to make eating at Al-Hana a habit. It sure beats the alternative of corporate chain restaurants, processed ingredients and assembly line packaged food.

J. Alexander's is not normally a place I would frequent, but we had a couple of birthdays to celebrate at work and it is right across the street. So a group of about 10 of us went. I ordered the steak and fries, the steak rare, and clam chowder. The clam chowder was awesome. My steak came and it was  well done. So, with these prices, I figured I should get what I asked for, so I sent it back. It came back rare alright. The first few bites were cold in the center and then it got to barely warm. Not impressive at all. And honestly, I can cook a better steak than that. Everyone else loved their meal, though. The service their is over the top, more than a bit too much. There are people constantly walking by, even standing and staring at your table at some point. Hang on to your plate, because the moment you pause from your meal, someone is there to snatch it. I think maybe they have cameras over the tables and an observation room, "Iced tea refill, table twelve, repeat, iced tea refill table twelve, over!" Though the wait staff did not appear to have ear-pieces, you still get the impression these are secret service wanna-be's, ready to dive to save your dropped spoon from hitting the floor. The menu had a lot of good, but traditional, items on it, steak, salads, burgers, sandwiches, all high-end, fresh, homemade, etc. Maybe if I had ordered something else my experience might have been totally different. But, even with work picking up the tab, I managed to have a bad free meal.

After hearing nothing but rave reviews of America's Taco Shop, it was time to give it a try. I ordered their "best Carne Asada in town" tacos. And I beg to differ. There are plenty of places I have had better Carne Asada. I'm going to blaspheme according to some, but I've had better Carne Asada at Chipotle, for meat's sake. I thought the meat was overcooked. I have yet to find somewhere that comes close to Comedor Guadalajara for Carne Asada. The side of beans was ok.  The staff was courteous and friendly, the service was great. But, I really don't see what the big deal is about America's Taco Shop. After all the hype, I expected it to be great. But it was good, at best. With a menu as limited as America's Taco Shop has, they should excel at what little they do offer and that's just not the case.

Ditto what Corianne S. said. After all, we went together and had the same things and were in love with the food.  Basically, I would eat whatever Johnny Chu put in front of me. The man is a genius and I have been following him around since the Lucky Dragon. Ok, so I only ate their once, but I remember how good the food was (years later) and Fate was absolutely amazing.  Johnny Chu, we love you. Yeah, I know. Sounds like a man crush, but when a guy can cook like that you can't help yourself.

Lunch at Indulge. A Kobe burger, french fries and onion strings.  $19.70. Not worth it. My friends agreed.  It is good, but I have had better. And for that much, it should be better.   They do have a variety; veggie burgers, turkey burgers and Kobe beef, french fries, sweet potato fries, onion strings, deep fried dill pickles (dickles). You can also build your own burger and they have a full bar with beer on tap.  The ambiance is decent, modern decor, and a friendly staff.  The only thing that blew me away about Indulge was my bill.

Sidebar is a trendy, hip down town bar located above Pei Wei and Starbucks. The bar is small, the decor is modern with a retro feel (Urban Outfitters, maybe?), dark wood, curvy white bar stools, ambient music and muted lighting. The beer and wine selection is good. A little pricey ($3 PBR, but at least they have it, and $5 Blue Moon), but not too bad. They have a good selection of spirits, too, Patron, Chopin Vodka, Booker's Bourbon, as well as the standard stuff, so there is definitely something for everyone. The "smoking patio" is a stairwell that leads outside the building. So, needless to say, it can get a little ridiculous with people crammed on the stairs puffing away. The place was cool. The crowd was definitely the hip and trendy crowd, but not too pretentious.  After a second trip here on New Year's Eve, I am sold. The cover was only $5, the staff is/was friendly, warm and welcoming. They have great drink specials, not just the price but great creations.

This place is what Yelp is all about. One of Phoenix's hidden gems. Al Rafedin is a tiny restaurant in a run down looking strip mall at 37th Ave and Camelback serving some great Middle Eastern Food.  You have your traditional items, kabobs, chicken, lamb, falafel and hummus, sandwiches and entrees served with rice. The portions are large and served with soup, which was a lamb broth and come with a plate of radishes, pickles, onions, jalapenos, a lemon wedge and cilantro. Pita bread is also served with the meals. The food is fresh and prepared as you order it.  Al Rafedin family owned and operated. We were served by the son and the father, who was also the chef. Both were very friendly and welcoming as well as the patrons.   The authenticity of the food was verified by the fact we were the only Anglos in the place, all the other customers were Middle Eastern. In fact, the owner told us this is the place where all the local Middle Eastern people come for food. If you love Middle Eastern food, this place is the best this side of the Tigris and Euphrates.

The Turf Pub is a great, cozy place. Part Irish Pub, part Sports Bar, part Modern, all rolled into one. And I think it works. A nice fit in downtown, next to Sens and Pasta Bar. There is seating on the patio, at the bar, or tables or booths. The beer and liquor selection is great, Irish brews and whiskeys, Scotch and the like. The food is amazing. A great menu with great selections, from traditional Irish fare like Boxty and Irish sausage to bar favorites like burgers and fries and hot wings. They have vegetarian selections, too. All at a reasonable price and good sized portions. The proprietors of Seamus and Rosie's have done well. It's a great place to go for dinner or just for drinks, or like we did, both. But it doesn't stop there, they are open for breakfast, too! From the traditional Irish breakfast to French Toast or pancakes, the breakfast menu looks really good. I see more visits to Turf Pub in my future.

Bulsho Restaurant is a great East African/Somali restaurant. It's located in a dingy little strip mall and the parking lot is full of cabs and seems to be where a lot of the Somalians hang out, which speaks to it's authenticity. The decorations and decor is meager, but the food and hospitality are top notch. And, after all, the food is what it's all about. We had the special, the chicken Biryani and the chicken leg and rice. The portions were huge, platter size, and food was amazing. The meals are large enough for two people to share and guaranteed leftovers. I ordered mango juice to drink and they brought us an entire pitcher. They have sandwiches, soups, currys and most entrees are served with basmati rice. You have your choice of beef, chicken, goat, but no pork, most Somalis are Muslims. For the less adventurous, they even have pasta on the menu, including a homemade version of Fettuccine Alfredo.  This is one of those places that makes Yelp great. Who knew we had an East African restaurant? So when you finally get the nerve to experience some real culture and some great food, go check out Bulsho. The staff makes you feel welcome and the food is wonderful.  Be adventurous. Explore. Eat. Experience.

You know the food is going to be good and authentic when Engrish is involved, the online menu lists "Stirs Fries" and "Fried Rices". My hope is that ethnic food is as authentic as possible since it's an opportunity to experience the food and culture of somewhere I might not ever get to go. And Thai E-San does not disappoint.  The menu is expansive, with something for everyone, tofu, fish, chicken, squid, duck, beef, pork, vegetables, rice, noodles, you get the idea. The ingredients are fresh and high quality.  The prices are reasonable (especially considering the portions are enough for two meals) and they have great lunch specials.  The staff is courteous and friendly.  I just can't get enough of Thai E-San. It's some of the best Thai food I've had in the valley.

I had high expectations for La Condesa, but it quickly turned to La Confusión. The three of us went in during the week for a late lunch, salivating at the thought of some tasty tacos. We each ordered a different  taco combo plate, one Aztec Tinga, one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken,  one Baja Sur Dogfish Shark, and a quesadilla.  After waiting a significant amount of time, the waitress brought out our quesadilla and one combo plate with one Aztec Tinga taco and one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken taco. Despite going over our order numerous times with our server and another gentlemen, somehow, what we wanted seemed beyond comprehension. They brought out the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark taco combo plate and, after waiting so long and confusion over our order, we gave up and ate what we had. The Azteca Tinga was superb. The Oaxaca Black Mole was good. The Baja Sur Dogfish wasn't really any better than your average fish taco. The rice is a white rice that had decent flavor and the same can be said for the flavor of the refried beans. La Condesa has a great salsa bar, a cozy interior decorated with some great Día de los Muertos art. The staff was nice and friendly, despite the fact our order remained so elusive. But, after the ordeal with our order and the less than stellar meal, I have to say that La Condesa was an utter disappointment.

Zinnias at Melrose Furniture and Collectible Mall is a great new place with a lot of really cool vintage and retro furnishings, art and collectibles. They have everything from an antique Last Rites kit to an Eames chair. The prices are reasonable and the items are in good to perfect condition. While you're there, visit the patio/outdoor furnishings upstairs.

We worked with MelonFish last week to photograph our baked goods for our new venture. Zach was a pleasure to work with, the set-up, shoot, and takedown went quickly and smoothly. Zach was helpful and cooperative, working with us to get the best result for each shot, and we weren't disappointed. The photography was even better than we had imagined. MelonFishPhoto is highly recommended, we would use Zach again without hesitation.
