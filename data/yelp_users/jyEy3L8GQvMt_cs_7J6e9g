I have a wedding coming up and needed to get my eyebrows on point, Ashley did just that. She is professional and wonderful at what she does! Highly recommended!!!!

I'm so disgusted that I plan on going there tomorrow to speak with a REAL manager. Bartender lied about being the management. Very unprofessional.  I intend on calling management tomorrow about my experience. It was inconsistent and unprofessional. I do not recommend this location. The only good this about this place is the dj and host. Announcing drink specials when not available is unacceptable. I will not come here for a reg spot, only for birthdays. Rude, short dark hair bartender. For the tip we left plus the 13 people in attendance to my friends birthday party should have been better attended to. Horrible service even though there were MULTIPLE employees in attendance. Bad birthday. Never again. Ever...
