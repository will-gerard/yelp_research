This place is one of the "dives in a strip mall" that seem so popular in this state. Today was not the first time that I have eaten here but, after reading some of the negative reviews, thought I would toss in my two cents.....   I like to go here for lunch. They are prompt and the food is the perfect amount for lunch....maybe a bit too much. I am a creature of habit. Once I find that one thing that I love, I can't help but to run comparisons to other restaurants. Erawan has 2 items on it that I have to name as Best in Phoenix......Mint Chicken and their Tom Yum Gai soup. FYI, you can not get that soup on the weekends though.   So, in short, this place is great for lunch and can't speak about how the service is any other time.

I have tried many sushi bars in Phoenix but as far as the quality, this location is the best I've had. I was at their location on 75th ave and have to say, the service there was much worse than this location. I took one star away because this place is kind of a dive and needs a facelift...however, that does not reflect the quality of their food. The staff is friendly and attentive. I saw a few negative reviews regarding the service. I wonder if maybe they were short staffed that day or if those people were too demanding. I've never had an issue with service here. I really wish that there were more of a variety of rolls. What they have is pretty traditional. The cucumber eel roll is probably my favorite here. There are a couple more sushi restaurants I haven't tried out yet but so far this is the best.

By far the best Chinese restaurant in the valley. I'm from the east coast and you really wouldn't think that Chinese food would be regional in the US...with that said, the food out here is different than the east coast. I have been on the quest for a decent General Tso's chicken and this place has it. It is as close to what I am used to that I have been able to find. The service is reliable and friendly. I have nothing negative to say.

I've been struggling with fixing my sunglasses for a few weeks unsuccessfully This place was incredibly fast and very reasonable. I can't say enough good things about this place.

What the hell. There's a major sporting complex on this side of the valley. Absolutely no restaurants other than pizza delivers here. This place is freaking ridiculous. I would rather stay over in fucking Scottsdale and have every type of food be able to be delivered to me and then take a car service to the fucking game. The west side of the valley sucks. You people need to freaking get more restaurants that deliver or have more delivery services that will go to other restaurants and pick up for you.  Booooooooo!

The owner contacted me to advise he was concerned and asked if there was anything that he could do.  That warranted a review update.  This was my reply:  I truly appreciate you contacting me regarding this but it is moot.  I'm sure you remember but I ended up putting a tree where the fountain would have been.  I would say to make it very clear to your designers to keep communication open.  The thing that irritated me the most is that I bought furniture to match the geometrics of the fountain and had to return it all...thank god they took it back LOL.  Honestly, you guys did an awesome job but communication is very critical to me and the fact that my fountain disappeared lost another.  If not for those two reasons it would have been a 5 star review.

This place is pretty damn good. Even though it was busy, we never had to ask for more to drink or pretty much anything. They got an extra star for the service. As for the food, it was pretty traditional. I didn't see anything on the menu that jumped out as a restaurant specialty. That's a shame because I'm always looking for new things to try. I ended up getting the Chicken Vindaloo. I would have preferred mine to be a bit more spicy but the waiter said that I can request extra spicy the next time.

First, I must say....freaking great martinis.  Now for the review.  Not that I'm ancient, but it seems that the crowd was much younger than I remember. I always preferred the older crowds but it really isn't that important to me. What I look for is friendly people who just want to have fun. There is plenty of that here.   I was there on Friday after work. It was about 8 pm and there was barely room to move. I could only stay for one drink but found I had to force myself to leave....early flight ;-( Anyway, this place has something for everyone.  Everyone was pretty friendly.  A few creepers around - just staring at people - but that is to be expected at any gay bar as far as I'm concerned.    The music wasn't really my style but could tune it out. I'm just not a fan of the wailing diva trash but I have yet to find that gay bar that plays Phish, Gogol Bordello, or Galactic - LOL. Ah, but that is my burden to bear.....

This place is AWESOME!  It's a trendy - hip kind of environment decorated very deco-shiek.  Not sure how else to describe it....the inside looks like a sculpture.  I'll have to snap some pictures when I'm there next.  I started with Miso soup which was pretty traditional and nothing to write home about. Same with the edemame. As far as those two things are concerned, its pretty hard to mess them up - lol.   The next course we did some sushi. I got a couple Maguro and can't remember the roll. They have such a large variety of rolls. There is definitely something for everyone on the menu. The Maguro was cut unusually thick for sushi. I had a hard time consuming it. Don't get me wrong, I love tuna but the concept behind sushi is one...maybe two bites. This was more like 4.   Next, I had the Koshou chicken. It was spicy and sweet...a great blend of flavors...served over a sticky rice. On the side were shitake mushrooms and asparagus. I wish I were able to describe this dish better. It was so good that I cant imagine going to Kabuki and not ordering it.   I was there during an off time 3:00 pm so service was exceptional. Not surprising since there were only a handful of people in the restaurant. I had to go back to work so didn't have a chance to sample any saki.....which there is a large variety. If you plan to go more than once, you can sign up for their "club" on line which gives you discounts and free meals once you accrue enough points. I am taking one star away for how the sushi was cut. Other than that, this place is incredible.

I can't believe I lived right down the street from this restaurant and never tried it. I feel like a complete fool.   The main dining area is an open spaced area with appropriate dim dinner lighting. Even sitting at a table, I still had the feel of privacy because of the lighting. The people I encountered were extremely friendly and (easily seen) truly proud of their restaurant.   LeAnn, my waitress, was extraordinary.....more on that later   They brought out bread with two types of spread. It was delicious but, since I was dining alone, stopped after sampling each type of spread. Both were delicious.   I started with a gin martini (as usual) and the lump crab cakes. What a treat - mostly crab and light on the fillers....perfect for a light appetizer.   After I was finished the manager, Mike, came out to great me and check on the service so far. Very pleasant and happy to welcome people to the restaurant.   I ordered the bone-in ribeye over the fillet (which I definitely need to try) at the recommendation of the waitress. I paired it with the Kenwood Cab. It was everything promised. My concern was that the steak would be over cooked. Usually, when I order steak out, I need to specify "on the rare side of medium rare" to make sure it is correct. I really shouldn't have worried. What you order is how it is prepared. It was juicy and tender as promised.   I finished with the carrot cake and a cordial. I must note that all the deserts are made in house and not frozen. Again, the dessert was perfect.   Before the dessert came out, I was greeted by Scott, the Operating Partner. He was clearly proud of this location and the chef. He was just checking on the service and ensure I had a good evening.   SUMMARY:   All in all, and those who know me know that this is a VERY RARE SENTENCE for me to commit to writting....but.........I have absolutely nothing bad to say about my experience at the Peoria Fleming's.   The waitress was attentive but not intrusive. The timing of the meal presentation was perfect with a steady flow of food and appropriate breaks in between. One of the problems I find most insulting at restaurants (feeling rushed or getting your next item before finishing the previous) is something no one should ever feel here.   One recommendation for improvement (to make a 5+ rating in my book) would be to have the wait staff remark on the local chef's creations. The "specials not on the menu" are the local chef's creations......maybe say something to remark on the uniqueness of these items not on the menu......"our local chef has prepared a few items you wont find at other Fleming's" or something to that effect....I know, minor, but there is always room for improvement LOL.

I'm rather confused about the reviews that this place has received. I went here for lunch today. We were the first ones there at 11:30 and while we were there, only three tables were occupied. I really cant see any justification for the horrible service....I'll get into that more in the review.   The restaurant itself is the typical strip mall restaurant setup. I liked the booths. The seats were like large boxes without backs. There wasn't anyone sitting behind us but can imagine that some might be uncomfortable with that when it's busy...your back would be literally against the back of the person sitting behind you. I'm a social person so think that it has potential and is an interesting way to provide seating.   The sushi wasn't bad....but wasn't anything to write home about either. It was a bit more expensive than it should have been. An iced tea, edemame, eel roll, and 1 piece maguro/ 1piece ebi ran me 18 bucks. I really wouldn't have minded if the service was good or if it was exceptional in the form of food presentation. Everything was mediocre at best.   The people I was with ordered from the lunch menu. They seemed to be quite happy with the quality and quantity of food. They each spent about 8 bucks. The egg drop soup was kind of bland according to one.   We all agreed on the service though. We had to ask for things multiple times, we were left alone with empty glasses, when our food came we were pretty much left alone, and we ended up sitting around for 10 minutes after we finished eating (staring at the waitress trying to get her to come over) before we had to go and ask for the check from the guy at the register. Our waitress was sitting at a table eating. Again, there were only 3 tables occupied and it was when they first opened. There is no excuse for the horrible service. I'm pretty understanding when it comes to justified bad service - I used to be a waiter. I understand that when things are crazy and chaotic, that service can suffer...and understandably. However, there is no excuse for how we were treated...or not treated as the case may be. I wont be going back to this place. If I do, it will be for carry out. It's been a long time since I've left anything less than 20% for a tip. The service dragged this rating down.  So, pretty much: Don't get the Sushi, Order from the lunch or dinner special menu, Don't eat in.

I left Chase Bank and switched to Compass last year. I don't recommend either and will probably be going to Wells Fargo. I rely on on-line banking. If you do too then DON'T BANK HERE. The balances are never right, they do not deduct your pending bill pays from your balance, the web site is rarely working on the weekends when it is needed most, and for the past three weeks, the transfer function has not worked. When you send notes to their customer service, they send generic replies, if they even reply as well. The customer service sucks and you have limited access to your funds because of poor web site maintenance.   Anyway, I'm in the process of moving accounts to Wells Fargo. They advised I wouldn't be seeing these problems.

I've been meeting with various landscape architects and designers for the past month and, hands down, this is one of the best I've worked with.  I have been working with Stephen but we are still in the planning phase.  The first day we met, he came over to check out the property and sat with me talking for some time to get a feel for me and what I was looking for.  The other companies I worked with made me feel rushed.  He seems to want to get it right and not push it.    As the project progresses, I'll make updates.  I am fairly confident that Flo Design will exceed my expectations.

I have NO IDEA why people are giving this place such high reviews.  I took a couple friends here for lunch because of the great reviews alone.  I was horribly embarrassed.  I took some pics of what I threw away - pretty much all of it.  I'll try to get them uploaded - you should know what you are in for at this place.  The food here is, without contest, the worst food I have had in Phoenix.  I wanted a variety of food to try so I got the Island BBQ Mix.  The "beef" was riddled with gristle.  Most of the meat was tough and completely inedible.  The chicken was rubbery.  I have no idea what the third meat was in the dish but suffice it to say that, after trying to find any tender meat around the bone, I gave up as it turned out to be a useless effort.  The other thing people were raving about in the reviews was the macaroni salad - What the f@$#@$k!?!  I suppose that some people simply love elbow macaroni with mayo....that is all it was - no other flavor of any kind.    I guess I should have turned around and walked out when I saw where you pick up your plastic utensils from an open bin.  One one can only imagine others reaching their filthy hands in to grab a handful of plasticware and put some back.  I would rather eat at a "restaurant" with a drive through than this place.  Save your money and time.  Skip this horrible disappointment.
