My boyfriend and I have enjoyed Mint Thai and Jasmine Thai but decided to try a new place.  Bad move.    We ordered Tom Ka Gai soup, Green Curry Chicken, and Cashew Chicken.  The soup was pretty good, not the best I've tried but met our requirements.  Plenty of chicken and mushrooms.  We ordered the chicken dishes at 3 stars - our usual for a new place and we were assured that 4 stars would be Thai Hot.  Both chicken dishes were completely bland and tasteless and definitely not 3 stars, I think 1 star would be a stretch.  The cashew chicken was oily but otherwise lacking in sauce, bland, and had no vegetables as we have come to expect at other restaurants.  The portion was small for $10 but we weren't really interested in eating it anyway.  The curry was better, salt helped, but still not spicy.  Looking forward to a spicy Thai dinner and was totally disappointed.  To be fair, it was takeout.  But I don't think that made any difference.  We picked up our order and ate it right away.  Bland is just bland whether it sits in my car for 10 minutes on the way home or not.  2 stars for the soup, but I would definitely not try any of the other entrees.  If you like spicy food, go somewhere else.

I just hung up with Rosati's pizza after calling to let them know of our poor experience.  My boyfriend went there with our two kids to pick up the pizza.  He waited 10 minutes watching our pizza sit there while they served about 10 other customers picking up their pizza.  By the time we got it it was cold.  The kids were hungry so he brought it home and we ate it.  Cold pizza is better than no pizza and hungry kids.  I called Rosati's; while on hold I listened to their "Satisfaction guaranteed" message.  Finally talked to a woman who claimed she was a manager.  I asked for a refund because my pizza was cold.  She insisted my pizza was not cold, and refused to give me a refund because we already ate some of the pizza.  So I'm supposed to turn around with my hungry kids and bring the pizza back and wait 45 minutes for another one?  Please.  Clearly they are disorganized about their service because they couldn't even find our pizza for 10 min while it was sitting right there getting cold.  She was extremely rude and obviously uninterested in providing good customer service.  1 star because the cold pizza was edible.

No frills, no fuss, just a darned good gyro.  And a good value - $8.95 for lunch includes gyro, fries, and drink.  I do wish I'd subbed a side salad for the fries.  I would definitely eat here again if I'm in the area.

We have been ordering Venezias forever. Yes it is that good. A few tips : They use plenty of sauce. Not like papa domino.  But not for the sandwiches. If you order a sandwich (and you should) ask for extra marinara plus a side of marinara. You can thank me later.  If you order a supreme or something with lots of veggies and you don't like it mushy with veggie juices order it well done. Dipping sauce optional but why not.

Omg. Love Venezias. I often dream of swimming in their cheese pizza. Hot and bubbly. The best pizza you can get delivered in the east valley by far. We've ordered once every couple of weeks for a long time and the quality is always there. This pizza is too good to top, but if you want toppings they will not disappoint.

Sakana is my go to place for sushi. No matter what you order, you can be sure the fish is fresh and delicious. And I mean fresh.  Nigiri are prepared with a large slice of fish. If you sit at the bar you get a complimentary appetizer. Specials are always interesting, including some nice baked sushi dishes. Service is fast and friendly. My daughter and I love to eat here for a girls night treat!

I'm not a vegetarian.  I was in the area and wanted Pho.  I was skeptical of the "Vegetarian Pho" but decided to give it a try.  Not bad at all.  The broth was a little lighter (less flavorful) than traditional beef Pho, but that's to be expected if there's no beef.  The hoisin and sriracha served on the side helped a lot.  The soup was served with a nicely plated stack of cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, a few sprigs of cilantro, and lime wedge.  I was a little disappointed at the lack of cilantro and basil.  The soup did contain tofu and some very interesting fake beef, which wasn't bad.  Overall, I enjoyed my lunch.  Service was excellent even though the place was very busy for lunch.  The other dishes I saw being served looked very good.  I'd be willing to come back and try another dish (maybe the Kung Pao "chicken"?)  Decor is a mix of trendy/hipster, kind of like a Pita Jungle feel to it.  (Tip to management, you might want to iron the tablecloths.  This doesn't bother me but you are in the middle of one of the snobbiest parts of Scottsdale so just a suggestion.)  For Pho, I will stick to traditional Vietnamese restaurants.  I would definitely recommend this place to a Vegetarian/Vegan friend, though.

Baci's is hands down the best, most authentic, Italian food I have had since moving to Arizona 14 years ago.    I come from an Italian family and have more than my fair share of pasta and sauce and bread and cheese under my belt, if you know what I mean.  If I'm eating Italian food that I didn't cook myself, it had better be from Baci's.  I have tried several different menu items and all have been fantastic, but each time I'm hard pressed not to order the Tortelloni Paisano.  It's loaded with their amazingly rich vodka cream sauce, prosciutto, mushrooms, and peas, and it's enough for 2 meals.  The main drawback with this dish is I can't stop eating it and leave the restaurant completely stuffed.  Their marinara sauce is sweet and just a little spicy, order it with any pasta or ask for a side to go with the fresh crusty bread.  We take a bowl of it home with us and I spend the next few days looking for things to put it on.  The salads are fresh and delicious.  I can't say I've tried much from the dessert menu because in the unlikely event that I'm still hungry I'll just eat more bread.  The owner, Frank, is always out chatting with customers and making sure we're having a good time.  Our kids love coming here because he will give them a little ball of pizza dough and once even gave them a tour of the kitchen.  Baci's is my go-to place for a birthday or special occasion dinner.  The decor is somewhere between a fine-dining establishment and a sports bar, classy enough but unassuming.  I have always had good service so I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about.  I'm sure things get busy especially on a Friday or Saturday night but all those people are there for a reason and that is fantastic food.  You will not be disappointed!

My husband and I dined at El Palacio last night.  We usually go to Arribas, but thought we'd try something new.  We started with the house margaritas, and of course chips, salsa, and bean dip.  All of these were ok.  My husband had the Mexican flag, and I had the Verde enchilada combo (chicken) with a pork tamale.  Both of us commented right away that everything was very SALTY.  I can't say much more about the taste because everything was so salty it just overpowered any other flavor.  On the plus side, I didn't leave feeling stuffed like I usually do at a mexican restaurant, because I didn't feel compelled to eat everything on my plate.  And the mini churros with whipped cream were nice.  Service was fine, no complaints, but the food was not worth coming back for.

I'm sorry to report that Jeremy L. was right.  I used to eat here or order takeout maybe once every couple months, over a period of a few years.  Consistently excellent flavor, generous portions, and quality ingredients.  My favorite was the garlic lover chicken, served in a rich brown garlic sauce over spinach.  They don't have it anymore.  My husband liked the cashew chicken, which always had plenty of meat and a variety of vegetables.  We always ordered the Tom Kha Gai soup.  Today's experience:  Soup was just ok, not as flavorful and didn't have the deep red color we've come to expect.  Cashew chicken was very bland, and was mostly green peppers, carrots, and onion, very little chicken.  I ordered the red curry chicken instead of the garlic lover.  It was ok, but not as good as I've had in the past.  It's a lot more disappointing when you know you should expect better.  I'm sad and disappointed that we'll have to find a new Thai place near our home.  We won't be ordering from Swan Thai again.

I called ahead and was told I could drop off at any time during business hours. I'm outside their door at 3pm on Wed. Door is locked and no answer on phone.

Ordered takeout today.  2 orders of garlic chicken, wonton soup, fried rice.  Ordering:  Glad to hear an Asian person answer the phone, instills confidence.  But seriously?  You can't substitute fried rice for $1?  They made me order a $4 side of egg fried rice (enough for 2).    Service:  Friendly and fast, no complaints.  Food:  Overall pretty good.  I'm from the east coast and I don't understand veggies in my wonton soup.  Mediocre Chinese food is one of the prices I pay for living in AZ.  That, and not shoveling snow.  I can deal with it.  Garlic chicken was very flavorful, and spicy as we requested.  Fried rice was adequate, but I was still pissed about the $4.    Value:  $9+ per entree, and portions are not very large.  I can deal with that if the quality is good, and it is.  However there is the matter of the rice.  If you are going to charge extra for that you are going to lose customers.  And they didn't give me the white rice which would normally be included with my garlic chicken.  Will I return?  Maybe.  I'm still pissed about the rice.

Hubby and I just ate here and enjoyed the food and service. Won ton noodle soup, pad thai, and green curry chicken were delicious. Would like to come back and try the Pho. Service was excellent. Will definitely be back!
