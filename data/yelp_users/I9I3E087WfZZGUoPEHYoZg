I. loved. this. place. my favorite spot I tried while in AZ this week. it was so good I was longing for my favorite Uptown girl to be there dining with me.  i started off with a cocktail called rye direction. that was definitely a step in the...  I had the Scottish salmon with onion ravioli. every last bite had more flavor than Public Enemy. I was blown away and damn near licked the plate clean. and then to follow it up with the bread pudding - which is such an understatement, because it is so, so much more. I forget how it is referred to in French; please accept my apologies.  my colleague ordered the chocolate souffl√© that was oooooowee goodie good. (I finish off all of her desserts after she has a couple bites.)  this would be a great date spot.  I would definitely come here again if ever in the area. *rubs magic lamp*

it's not every day I eat Thai food, but it's pretty much amazing here. at least the catfish meal I had was. so much more than flavorful. I was supper pleased. and my colleague's beef bento box meal was the same.  I also had the fried mango and ice cream dessert - loved that too. and excellent service.  I wanted to come here again before leaving but had to try as many different spots as possible while in AZ. I was with you again in spirit tho, Soi 4...

came here for lunch yesterday with a colleague and client. excellent lunch spot. it was 95 degrees and we had to sit outside, not that inside was much cooler as the restaurant is fairly open, but it actually wasn't bad because the overhang blocks out a lot of the sun's heat. this is coming from someone who acts like it's the 28th day when it's hot. no Aunt Flo visiting today tho.  I had the tuna ahi sandwich and it was good af. then my colleague talked me into getting the caramel banana split (because it was apparently Nat'l Dessert Day and I do desserts better than Debbie did Dallas.) I murdered it. I'm leaving AZ tomorrow before they find me...

stopped here for lunch today. excellent service. the waiter was sure to explain the difference of Neo...alyssamilanotan...politan...you know what i'm sayin', type pizza. I already know, we have a spot in my neighborhood, but it's probably a good thing they explain for those who might not know, so you know what to expect - and at Pomo you can expect excellence.  and to add to the authenticity many Italian accents.  *kisses joined fingertips, explodes hand bomb*

nah, son.   we stopped here on the way to our hotel after our flight from NJ. My colleague said to just pick anything out i saw along the way. I somehow expected ANY Mexican place in Arizona to be good, kinda like in San Diego. Apparently I was wrong.   I love carnitas. Our waiter raved about the carnitas there when I expressed my interest. dude was either full of caca or has never had good carnitas in his life. I've never had carnitas so dry before. this place is obviously about serving large portions for low prices - but the quality is lower than the prices. i wasn't even feeling the fried ice cream here. it's not easy to get me to talk negatively about dessert, yo.  the Cadillac margarita was okay. and if it weren't for the Frida Kahlo art on the walls I would chalk this experience up as a total loss. Frida gets a star all her own.  Oh, saw the end of the Giants/49ers game where the Giants won it in the last few minutes. that was good too.
