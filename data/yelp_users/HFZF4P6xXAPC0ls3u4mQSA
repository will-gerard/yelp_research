There is nothing good about this venue. My husband and I had an issue with the date of our wedding. After going back and forth with the owner Michele, we had to cancel our services with the Antique Wedding House because Michelle was not willing to even discuss any other options. We paid the entire cost of the venue 8+ months before the date of our wedding, rather than the traditional deposit and remainder due at 60 days out. I contacted Michelle more than 60 days before the date (just under 90 days). Michelle was extremely rude and obviously upset that they wouldn't be hosting the wedding. Michelle refused to refund any portion of the $5000.00 paid to the venue. She states, "Any monies paid to The Antique Wedding House is non-refundable. This is to protect us from wasting our time and resources on individuals not taking the event, our services, and our vendors seriously". Not taking it seriously?! This is our wedding, of course we are taking it seriously. Over all, there were issues from the start. We purchased and all inclusive package. Come to find out, it's not all inclusive. Unless you want a three tier cake with no designs, you are going to pay a couple hundred more for that. The "All Inclusive" package didn't even cover colored chair covers, or table clothes. All you receive is the most basic version of everything and if you want anything colored, personalized, or pretty, it's going to cost you an additional couple of hundred dollars. The owner is greedy and lacks any sense of compassion. All she is looking for is to pinch all pennies possible after getting someone to sign a contract. If you do decide to go with this venue (and I warn you, there are much better venues in the area with great prices and great customer service), please make sure that you go over every little tiny detail of what is included. Ask about the color of the table cloths, chair covers, and napkins are included in the package and what colors will cost extra. I even had to pay for a different song to be played as I walked down the aisle, because it wasn't the traditional music. This venue is anything but helpful or positive. Michele never acted excited to do the wedding or even for us to get married. She made it seem as though they were doing us a favor by letting us have our wedding there. I would stay FAR AWAY from this venue. DO NOT HAVE YOUR WEDDING HERE!! You want your wedding to be a positive experience with someone who is happy for you and willing to do whatever is needed to make your day special. You will not get that with Michele at the Antique Wedding house. This was the worst experience I have ever had. Ultimately we were able to get in with another venue, but at the loss of $5,000. All Michele cared about was our money. They came up on $5,000 and we were unable to go on a honeymoon due to having to book another venue. DO NOT DO IT!

This place works with a delivery system that my work gets food from, and I have always been hesitant to try it! I'm not big at eating outside the box, but today I thought I would give it a try! I ordered the Shish Kabob and the filet was amazing! I was worried it wouldn't be as tender as a traditional filet, but I was proven wrong. The meat was tender, and seasoned very well. You get to choose from the mild seasoning or the spicy, and I went with the spicy, and the kick was just right! Plus, there was a hint of sweet that hits you right toward the end! My sides were the rice and the fries. Who doesn't love fries? They event sent a side of ketchup that I didn't order, and I was happy they did! The rice was a little bland for my liking but was decent over all. The pita included was fresh, which you rarely get doing takeout. I will definitely be back, and would with out a doubt recommend to my friends! Happy eating!

I was referred to Tori by a good friend who received an awesome color from Tori. I drive here from Gilbert to get my hair done, and I will definitely be keeping it up! Tori always knows exactly what to do with my hair. I have had very blonde hair my whole life and always keep it my natural with occasional low-lights, and my hair was colored brown by a stylist at another salon. Tori was very welcoming when I reached out to her for the correction and to begin the blonding process. My hair is in fabulous condition despite the continued processing on it. As I am prepping for my wedding, Tori has always treated my hair as a priority and is doing whatever she can to get it back to normal for the wedding! My style and cut is beautiful and the color is coming along nicely. Will update my review along the way with my color updates! I would, with out hesitation, refer all of my friends to Tori for any of her services. I completely trust Tori with my hair, and love going to her for my cut/color and style.

I have been using Birdhouse Vinyl for all of my printing needs for my upcoming wedding, as well as my husband uses the shop for his business cards, stickers, etc. Birdhouse Vinyl has far exceeded my expectations and continues to provide everything I am looking for! The owner Cody is very friendly and always willing to work with your designs! I am very particular about how I want things, and he has always provided what I am looking for. Cody always provides top notch work, and is great at his job! The prices are great and very affordable in comparison to other shops in the valley. The shop is set up well, clean and welcoming. I would definitely recommend Birdhouse Vinyl to all of my friends and reviewers alike!

I am not even sure where to begin. My husband and I attempted to visit Dierks Bentley's Whiskey Row, here in Tempe for my brothers birthday. My husband and I have been to Whiskey Row many times in the afternoon, as my husband's tattoo shop is just a few doors down. We had decent service every time we had been there in the past and had never had a problem. I wish this had been the case on the night of my brothers birthday. We were a few minutes behind my brother and his friends, so they were already inside. When we got to the door, one of the security guards put his hand in front of my husband as he was walking in and told him he was not welcome in their establishment because he had visible tattoos on his neck and they do not condone gang activity. The bouncer would not even look my husband in the face when this occurred. He kept his head down and insisted that we leave the premises immediately. We were speechless, and had to ask the bouncer if he was joking. We thought there was no way that they were not going to allow my husband into the bar due to having tattoos. And to assume that it was gang related? My husband is a successful tattoo artist here in the valley. He is a father to two beautiful little girls, and is nice to everyone he meets. We are completely disgusted with this level of discrimination. I do understand that all establishments have the right to refuse service to anyone that they would like, but this has gone too far! I am not sure why we are allowed to visit this bar during the day, but as soon as the sun goes down, my husband and I were treated with a level of disrespect that it not fair to anyone. My husbands shop has had many company lunch parties at whiskey row, and my company has also done the same. We will never go to Whiskey Row ever again, as well as we are spreading the word to all of our family, friends, and clients who all agree that this establishment is not a place that any of us would like to support. Many of our clients and friends are refusing to visit Whiskey Row again, due to this exhibit of discrimination, and we will continue to spread the word. Bars are a dime a dozen around here, and there are many who not only support the local artists, but promote their business, and welcome them with open arms to enjoy the music, drinks, and good time. I am not sure how Dierks Bentley would feel about having his name attached to such a disgusting act, and we have every intention on making this issue public, reaching out to Dierks Bentley on Twitter and any other social media avenue possible, until we receive an answer. This is 2016. A year where everyone is free to express themselves how they see fit, and not feel they must be silenced, or stay home because of the way that they look. The general manager Kevin O'Connor as well as the rest of the Whiskey Row staff should be ashamed of themselves, and this discrimination should not only be corrected but prevented from occurring in the future. Nobody should ever be subjected to this type of treatment at any time.
