I write very few bad reviews but this is one I can't get out of my mind.  I just moved in 2 miles away and was glad that there was a quick, small hardware store near by that i could use.  I am military and typically ask for a discount as it is pretty much industry standard at hardware stores.  I am never upset when a company does not offer one but this time was different.  The cashier responded with a " Why would we offer you a discount? I don't get a discount because I am a woman."  I don't hate ACE exactly what you need for a quick home repair and others were very nice inside.  I was just so taken back by someone saying something so rude I could not possibly recommend them or do business with them again.

Here is an excerpt from my small claims suit against my HOA because I cannot get Mutual Management to do their job.  I initially contacted Mutual Management on 9 Aug 2012 in regards to a single broken roofing tile over my garage.  I spoke to Greg and explained that I would like the HOA to fix the roof.  The HOA agreement explains that among other things the HOA is responsible for roof repairs (HOA CC&R PARAGRAPH 7.1.6).  Greg told me that because it was monsoon season it might be one to two weeks to get it repaired however he would handle it.  Three weeks later on 30 Aug 2012 I explained that it was not repaired and was again told that it would be taken care of.  I contacted Greg the following week on 7 Sept 2012 and twice the week after that on the 11th and 13th of September.  I was advised that he was working on the situation and instead of taking care of it he referred a roofer to me.  The roofer told me that they would take care of the situation shortly. On 30 October I contacted Greg and informed him that the repair was still not complete.  He told me again that he would work on getting it fixed.  I also spoke to the roofer Greg referred to me and was told that they would have it fixed on Thursday 1 November 2012. It remains unrepaired. Finally Greg has explained several times that I should not be concerned because the roofing tile doesn't protect my roof.

EVERYTHING IS GOOD. It's not cheap and the atmosphere isn't real trendy but my experience was awesome. We came in on the restaurant.com certificate and had the best dinner so far in Phoenix.

Try the lunch bagels!  The Northern exposure and Tempe turkey are excellent.  The chicken salad is really good too.  They aren't real expensive and the service is pretty good.  They also have outdoor seating.  They are new and as far as I can tell not a chain.  I recommend you try them.  Oh a dozen bagels are half priced after 2pm.

This place is delicious. I have been twice with my girlfriend and will defiantly be back. The service is consistently good. The food is made with high quality ingredients and cooked in a wood burning oven. They also have a unique beer selection! It can be tough to find though. It is tucked in the back corner of a shopping center. They do have a small patio that is nice in the spring and fall.

Food is delicious! I have been several times and you should expect a wait. They have several 2 person tables so if you have 4 or more people that wait just got worse. There food is natural and its so good...Its not too expensive either. The place is very small and parking is a problem.

Yeah even though its not super easy to find it the food is great.  Everything seems to have a Southwest flare.  The Mashed potatoes are great and the creamed corn is amazing.  The Short rib's are a must try.  If you are in this area and looking for a great dinner or lunch you should really check it out.  It is very small so a reservation wouldn't be a bad idea.

Yeah the Pulled Pork sandwich is pretty delicious.  The Mashed potatoes are good too.  They are only open for lunch by the way and since they get busy if you are getting take out you should call ahead.

Ok this place is wicked cheap and the food is delicious.  The menu is huge and about 1/2 english. The service is always great... If this place served beer I would eat here every day.

Danny's has a 72hour rain guarantee and always has a coupon on their website.  They do a good job inside and out.  They have an express wash that only takes care of the outside that only costs $5.00.  They will try and sell you extras and they will discount the extras if you ask.  If you buy gas there with the wash the gas is about 15 cents cheaper.

It's pretty good... I really liked the brisket.  I am still in search of the perfect BBQ place here in the Phoenix area.  The service by the way was killer so I would recommend it.  BTW check out the cool light fixtures when you are in there.

Good burgers and apps.  the service is pretty good and the place has a special all the time.  I think everything is 1/2 price until 7!  Even when that ends they have something special.  Between the billion TV's and cheap booze I'm a fan.

Bottom line is, I recommend it.  They have a solid staff, good beer \ drink selections. Prices are commensurate with their location. If you're at a game its certainly worth your time. I've read some harsh reviews. The food is good, service normal, and beer selection good and cold. It's tough to judge poorly on this place.
