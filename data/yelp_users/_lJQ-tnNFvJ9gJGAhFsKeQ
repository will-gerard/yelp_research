Devil's is a great place to come with friends and hang out and catch any sports game. Their happy hour is the best in town. A nice place to come to and cheer on the sundevils.

Will only give one star. Went this past Saturday for fix was told over the phone no cover before 6 so all 8 of us went over there about 5pm we were already at a pretty big tab, we were then told we all had to pay a cover for the fights talked to the manager they didnt seem to want to honor what we were told on the phone......so beware when they tell you no cover before a certain time we will never be back.....

First time here this past sunday 12-17-13 was looking for a nice place to watch the niners game. Me and my buddy eric came down sat at the back bar, service started out good but buy the 4th quarter of the game couldn't get a beer to save my life. Will say food is good when it does come. Not sure if ill be back....
