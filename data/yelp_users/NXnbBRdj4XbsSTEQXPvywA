I came here only because I was in town visiting my Mom and she was able to get me in with her nail gal for a mani and also with her hairstylist for a quick bang trim. First of let me say the salon really is gorgeous and everyone from the receptionists to everyone else I came in contact with were really sweet.   I saw Joyce for my bangs - OMG. OMFG. I've had bangs most of my life and have generally been annoyed and unhappy with them. She trimmed them in a way I'd never seen before and I was instantly in love. When I got my hair done the other day I had to tell my hairdresser to finish it off with the vertical cut because after months of my own trims (and totally nailing it btw) it had finally gotten too far out of whack. How silly that a change in angle of scissors can make a girl so happy. My bangs fell into place every day up until last week (when I knew I had a hair apt on the horizon) on their own with no need to attempt to flat iron them into submission. LOVE them.   Marty, Martie? did my nails - and supposedly she's about the same age as my Mom but sadly looks much more aged. She's a sweetie but I felt a bit awkward with her and she refused to cut my nails as short as I wanted because "they were too nice." My Mom wouldn't let me file them down when I left either because she didn't want me to ruin it. Hello...yes you made the appointment but I paid for it! So needless to say the minute I arrived back in town I immediately headed for the clippers. I wouldn't say it was an awful job but I didn't think it was worth the $25 or whatever it was either.   I was recently back in AZ and was hoping to be rescued by Joyce again but alas, she was out for a family emergency :-(

I'm all about supporting local business and Crown Fine Jewelry DEFINITELY deserves your support! My sisters, Mom and I popped in to inquire how much it was to get our rings cleaned. Christopher was SO nice and said no charge - it's complimentary. So one by one we handed over our rings and took in the beautiful jewelry in the store. We all found something we loved but we didn't end up purchasing anything - yet. One of my sister's fell in love with a bracelet and my Mom fell in love with a necklace. She'd have to save up a bit for it but assured him for all of her future jewelry needs he's her new go-to place.   Christopher was extremely friendly and knowledgeable; he was truly a pleasure to meet and talk to. He will definitely be getting our business when we're in town and my Mom's for sure from now on. It's sad when it's amazing to meet such passionate and friendly people these days but such a nice change of pace!

Took my boyfriend here for lunch as we were 'on our own' for lunch on my recent visit. I had the Turkey Breast & Brie and he had the Grilled Turkey Pastrami. I must admit when I saw his sandwich I was jealous and unsure of mine, but alas - they were both delicious!   Well, actually I never got to taste his because he didn't share, but it looked amazing and he didn't speak much so we'll say that he agrees.   We were here at an off-peak time on a Friday so it wasn't crowded and the wait wasn't very long to get our food. I think it's a great gourmet sandwich place with bakery items and coffee which is a great  alternative to fast food and the couple of restaurants in the center.  I'm sure the locals who work in the area frequent it often!

I was here last month in the middle of a "shop till you drop" escapade with my Mom and sisters. Out of the years I've been coming (okay growing up) at Fashion Square I'd never once eaten here!   We ate out on the terrace and we were surprised there wasn't a wait for 4 of us on a busy Saturday during lunch happy hour. The service was friendly enough and but the sushi, oh wow the sushi was great! We ordered six or so different things and just nibbled away. I didn't have a drink since I was already battling falling over sleepiness, but I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the break from the air-conditioned mall!

My family has been coming here for over 10 years. Both of my sisters used to work here at one stage, and one of the waitresses - Mary - has been there over 25 years!   The ribs are what they're known for and by golly they're good. It seems that they've changed their menu a bit as far as what was once included with the meal are now extra charges. But you have to get the twice baked cheddar potato. Is it worth it you ask? Well...let's just say we had to order a SECOND one because it was mind blowingly good. *drool*   The bread and bagel chips were amazing as always and the ribs well, the ribs speak for themselves.  We've always had great service and food here and this time was no exception. Mary recognized us and told our waitress about us (well, ok, my sisters, not me) and they threw in a free dessert - for all of us. We were there for my Dad's Bday so he was already getting one - but we all ordered something different and nibbled the night away.

After shopping up a storm at Designer Studio Boutique & Tailoring and inducting Denise into our family - she recommended the Rumbi Island Grill. Considering it was just at the other side of the parking lot we were easy game. My sisters, Mom, and I walked into the place to check out the menu and were pleasantly surprised - there was a lot of healthy and delicious looking options to choose from.   I went for the Voodoo chicken salad and was so impressed and thought it was absolutely delicious! The chicken was moist and flavorful, the sauce was tasty and not overdone. It was a filling yet light meal.   The place was very clean and comfortable and the perfect break between shopping trips!

Came here on Friday with my Mom and two sisters after a day of shopping up Fashion Square. There was a bit of a wait (35+ minutes) which would've been okay if it wasn't 200 degrees at 8pm. In any event, once we were seating I must say everything was perfection. Everyone had some wine, our waiter/service was great, and the food was to die for. We started out with the Parmesan Truffle Fries as a starter - OMG - incredible!   I had the Free Range Chicken which was not only presented nicely but tasted even better. I wasn't a huge fan of the veggies but the mash and chicken were SO good. Everyone else had fish and since I don't eat that stuff I can't comment - but I know everyone was impressed!   We divulged and finished off the night with the Peanut Butter Torte. Again: OMG. The torte itself was amazing but the salted peanut butter gelato on the side was INCREDIBLE. Sigh. Definitely worth the wait. And if nothing else the people watching was fairly priceless...

I just returned home after staying here Friday - Sunday night for my fiance's yearly work retreat. I must stay I was really excited to stay here after perusing through the website, yet although the place was still very nice, it also seemed a bit of a let down. The bed however was very comfy (thank goodness since I spent one whole day sleeping) and the room nice with two flat screen tv's and a mini Keurig coffee maker. They also have a fridge and YAY 24-hour room service. Although the room service food didn't blow me away (cheeseburger) it was pretty tasty and OH MY GOSH THE PICKLE!!! It was like a mini canoe and I happily chowed away on it; a meal in itself.   The grounds were nice and spread out just enough without being ridiculous. I had breakfast at Rick's Cafe this morning and had a great bagel and lox. My only complaint is that they have attack birds, so should you choose to accept your mission of eating outside, bring a weapon. THEY DO NOT FEAR YOU.   As someone who generally despises LV it was nice to stay somewhere smoke and drama free. It is a good $60/30-45 minute cab ride to the strip however, so if you're planning on going for a show or anything, be mindful of travel time.   I would've loved to have checked out the spa, but apparently my interests in sleeping outweighed the ability to pick up the phone and schedule anything that required me leaving the room.

I hadn't been here since it was known as The Counter - it was good then and it was amazing now.   Stopped in for a bite with Mom while visiting AZ and decided to try the Roast Beef sandwich (cold). O.M.G. It was probably the best roast beef sandwich I've ever had. I couldn't even save a bite for my Mom (sorry Mom!) - just wolfed it down. I may have left a couple of pounds heavier but I enjoyed every morsel of it.

Out of all the times I've been AZ (not to mention living there) I'd never even heard of this place or been taken here (yay for visiting and parents wanting to feed you)!  Everything is fresh and healthy and being that was I going for vegetarian at the time I had plenty of options. After a pain-staking decision I went for the Veg'd Out. AMAZING. I practically licked my plate. (Luckily my parents raised me better than that. In public at least).   The service was friendly and most efficient and the food was delicious; definitely an improvement over the usual breakfast places I generally get dragged to!   Bonus points for the humorous menu..I'm such a sucker for menu's with a sense of humor.

This is a bit over-due and ergo hazy....but I remember the chips and salsa were nothing short of AH-MAZING!   I was in town for Thanksgiving and the man and I made the trek here to meet up with an old high school friend that I hadn't seen in....well, in awhile.   The food was great and the chips and salsa...did I mention? Ah-mazing!  We stayed around after they left and moved to the bar but oddly enough after another round or so of drinks and way before the ASU/CAL game was over the place was closing up and like 10or 11ish. Weird! Other than the chips/salsa I don't really have a reason to drive to BFE  (Mom in Surprise, Dad in Fountain Hills and I live out of state) but I really enjoyed the place!

Ugh crap. I NEED my hair done. But I'm away from home this entire month. I'm in Scottsdale for two weeks, surely I can find someone right? Enter Yelp, D'Lisa, and Dustin - whom I'd like to take home with me (his household really, except the cats).   I called on a quick break to call the salon - but the number I called happened to actually be D'Lisa's cell phone. She told me that she has two stylists that you can make an appointment via the website but that if I had any issues to call her back. On my next break I promptly hopped on my phone, picked an appointment time, created a login, and boom, appointment for a few days later.   Dustin sent me an email to ask me what I was looking for in my hair appt and to thank me for making an appt with him. I wrote back (pic attached of course) of what I wanted and we were ready to go. The night of my appt he texted me and told me the previous appt was carrying on much longer than it should have and asked if we could reschedule for the next day. A few texts later we were good to go for the next day.   The salon is small but perfect; and she has Betta's! Ah, I miss my fishes. I digress though. I felt like Dustin was an old friend, but yet there were all these new things to learn about him! He really took the time to analyze my hair and discuss the approach. He did an absolutely fabulous job on both the color and the cut. He also took the time to really make sure my face was free of dye instead of sending me out into the world with the "oh she just got her done" marks. The price was shockingly amazing and I kept confirming if he didn't want to charge more. Guess I've been in Cali too long. Yippeee!!  I briefly strolled through Fashion Square after and felt extra noticed and my hair appreciated. Thank you Dustin - if I ever find myself in need of help/happy hair again when in town I'll definitely be coming for you!

I'd say 2.5 stars...I've downgraded them a bit after giving the mani/pedi a look over in teh days following :(   Friday night after my class and my re-scheduled hair appointment I found myself dying for a 9 month overdue mani/pedi. I just searched for places near DSW as I had a coupon burning a whole in my purse and came up with a few places near by, but this one was the absolute closest.   I popped on over and saw they were only open for another 30 mins so I asked if they could do a mani/pedi in that time. They were a little reluctant but ended up saying it was okay. I really wanted a gel polish one but I know how long those can take so i didn't bother asking.   The service was nice and the gals did talk to me; although they also busted into laughter a few times while speaking Korean so even though I feel fairly certain it wasn't about me it's hard not to be paranoid.  They did a decent job; I would've probably been pickier on asking for my nails filed down more and such but I was just so thankful to get someone to take me that I just sat back and relaxed. The place is clean and everyone was very friendly but when I got some time to really study my nails/toes later I wasn't very happy. My nails weren't filed much (should've spoken up I suppose) and as someone else stated the top coat on my pedi was too thick and started to peel/chip off pretty quickly; usually pedis last me over a month. They also did a shoddy job of filing/shaping my toe nails - there were several I had to go back and file down for fear of cutting myself!

So it's the Saturday after Thanksgiving and all through the house  - BURGERS NOT TURKEY we all cried out! This place is close to my Mom's and allowed us an easy way to get some grub to go and allow the cook a day off. We hopped onto the website, made a list (checked it twice) for the 10 of us, and then three of us cruised over to make the order and pickup. OMG. I'm still dreaming of this place. Too bad it's a 5 hour drive....I could REALLY go for another burger from this place! My husband and I both indulged in the Culver's Bacon Deluxe, and everyone ordered a smattering of other burgers plus 8 orders of fries. We avoided the Cheese Curds because it seemed a lot of other reviewers weren't too pleased with them. Oh, there was also an order of onion rings but I didn't get to sample those. Our only "issue" if you will is that we requested all of the burgers be single patties and realized when we got home and unwrapped them all they were double patties - but don't worry - I still CAN'T BELIEVE I ATE THE WHOLE THING. It was SO good!!! I think there was only one in the group who felt his wasn't what we ordered ( hey, we went off of the list) but I was in seventh heaven. The place was more fast food-ish than I had pictured when we first walked in but I don't care, the food was delish and the service was pretty fast. My husband also split his chocolate malt with me which was very, VERY good. I guess I'll just keep dreaming of this burger until my next visit - but thank you Culver's for a delicious "last meal" with the family before we hit the road that day to head home.

I'm sorry...but I love these guys - no matter what location I go to in what state they are always awesome and today my visit at this spot was no different. I noticed at the end of my drive in from CA last week that there was a noise coming from the passenger rear tire/wheel. Of course I was unsure of taking it to the dealer or to Discount first...and I made the wrong choice of going to the dealer. They were nice and allegedly inspected everything (it's all under warranty still) so I was glad they it had been looked at but not satisfied in knowing that I'm NOT crazy* and making things up (in this instance).  So it stopped making the noise until today and I was planning on still running over anyways, especially because I know they're closed tomorrow and I might be "going back to cali, cali" early Tuesday.   So I roll up and there's a bit of wait but I'm fine, a few minutes later I'm helped out and as the guy is pulling up my records and asks me which car it is (I probably have like 5 in their records at LEAST). He locates Mr FJ and I can't resist letting him know that his name is Toby. Yes. I am one of those people. I greet my car and love him so.   He asks if I just want them to do an air pressure check or put it on the lift and check it and I opt for the full treatment. He tells me how long it'll take and I give him the go ahead. He'd already somewhat diagnosed it from checking it out in the parking lot (people that know what they're doing - what a concept!) and confirms that the tire is wearing a bit and is cupping. Ha, i knew I wasn't crazy (in hearing car noises)! He rotated the rear tires so it'll wear evenly for me and sent me on my way. Everyone was friendly and lively and I couldn't help but catch some giggles listening to some of these guys work. Another awesome Discount visit all around.

I popped in here one day during lunch while doing a crash course at the RE school up the road. I was unsure but one of the employees was standing outside and kind of ushered me in. I walked in and looked at the menu puzzled, which you would think would encourage someone to speak up and tell me how they work...but alas. When I tried to place my order with the owner he just stared at me until one of the gals finally told me to head down to the other end.   I ordered the veggie wrap thinking it would be healthy but boy was it the opposite. The thing was huge, awkward, and super messy. And of course I found myself with no napkins. The veggies that were in the wrap were swaddled in oil and after halfway through the oil spill I gave up. $10 for that mess. Also the owner asked me where I was from since I clearly wasn't a regular and when I told him SD he was quick to tell me how he doesn't like it there...not the normal answer I get, which is fine, it's your opinion, but talk about putting me off as I'm paying for my $10 wrap!

This review is pretty overdue - time flies eh? But all I can really say is Ick - no. I was in town and staying with my Mom and she was pretty excited to take myself and some other lingering family members here for dinner. Having been a frequent Benihana-er in the past I feel my expectations were pretty high.   The service itself was okay - but our cook - he was SO wrong. I'm sure he's just trying to make everyone laugh but he was making sexual noises and "oh yeah baby's" while "beating the meat" or whatever it was he was making. I was there with my Mom and her husband, but even if it was just friends of mine? Ew...no. So disturbing. Older Asian guy "making love" with and to my food does NOT equal appetizing in my world.   Not only that - but the fried rice was a disaster. I live for fried rice - and it was almost non edible. Who puts garlic in their fried rice? Well, sure, these guys do. Not just a hint - like a mouthful of "HEY I JUST ATE LOTS OF GARLIC" amounts of garlic. I had the Salmon as well - which was tasty overall but it was so over-salted/peppered that I found myself choking on it until I eventually gave up.   Sorry to say - none of us will be back here. Not cool guys - just - not cool.

I always seem to find the greatest people in areas where I don't live! So I'd had a rough couple of weeks and my nails were over a month grown out from my previous gel manicure - which was awesome, but done overseas. Sigh. So last minute I hit up Yelp to see if someone in Scottsdale was capable of giving me another amazing gel polish. Enter Sharie and this adorable nail spa.   I called the day before and she had several openings so I picked one and was very excited. I ended up calling back the next day to try and move it earlier but she said she'd gotten all booked up so I stuck with my original time and filled the void with some lunch.   The place is super tiny, like 5 people max, so yes, making an appointment is key for this place! You'll feel like you're in your old little happy place if you come in with Sharie on a quiet evening or weekend appointment and will have the place practically to yourself.  Sharie did an AMAZING job on my spa pedicure (everything is disable and clean) and even more amazing job on my first real color Gellish manicure. It's been well over a week now and I've done usual household cleaning and washed two cars and they still are perfect. I never knew why gels were so amazing but it really comes down to proper application.   I definitely recommend coming here (with an appointment!) for a relaxing and brilliant experience. Next time I'm in town and in need of a gel polish/fill I will SO be back! Thanks Sharie! Talent and a huge heart - what else do you need?

I don't come to this side of the shopping center much...or ever really... but one of my sister's wanted to hit up Nordstrom Rack and we made a few stops along the way.   This is a super cute store - I love shopping at resale shops and reducing the "hey I know where you got that" phenomenon whenever possible. Everyone but my Mom found something worthy of buying - they had some great clothes/shoes/bags and even better prices!

My Mom recommended this place - my oldest sister is a super health food nut and I've been on a new meatless journey - so she thought because they couldn't try it out last week (hello 1 1/2 hour wait) we would take it for a test spin. I really love the decor and the feel of this restaurant! The outdoor patio is very well set up with heaters and cute little sitting areas with fireplaces and fire pits.   Everything is very healthy, earth friendly and sustainably grown. I really liked the idea of it. I started off with the Cucumber Refresher drink and it was delicious. Their soup of the day was Miso which although it tasted a bit saltier than I would've liked I still think it was very tasty. We ordered the Herb Hummus for the table and were not disappointed. I had the sashimi tuna salad and I must say I felt a bit let down on this. The dressing was okay but not great, and I don't feel there was enough tuna or avocado given it's $14 price. Also I was hoping for something fancier than mostly iceberg lettuce given that there's no nutritional value in it. My Mom really enjoyed her Miso Alaskan Cod, her hubby seemed to enjoy the Bison Burger and I'm not too sure if my Dad and his wife enjoyed their Teriyaki Rice bowls - I guess I didn't hear any complaints so...? My fiance had the Panang Curry dish extra spicy and said it was good. Our server was friendly and attentive to our needs about having to get out by 7p to catch a couple of planes. We were too stuffed to try any of the desserts but they certainly sounded good.   I like the idea of this place but I'm not sure I was really sold on it. Perhaps it's a better drink and appetizer place - I almost fell over when I saw the bill: $175 for six. There were a fair amount of wine glass refills but still - ouch.

While visiting my Mom and her husband they took me here for dinner since I'd never been before and we wanted to stay local. I really liked the atmosphere and the view is amazing - we sat out on the patio and it was gorgeous! I checked in on Yelp and was surprised to see that they have a Yelp offer for free hummus - it was SO good and definitely a great start to our dinner which was super tasty. Service was prompt and friendly too - I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area!

If only I'd had more time...I did not want to leave this store! What a great grocery store! I'm in town visiting my Mom with my little munchkin so we were in a bit of a rush but if I'd had my way (or had left the little one at home) I would've hung out here for quite awhile. The store is huge, beautifully laid out and just fancy and sparkly. They're remodeling the Ralph's by my house but it'll never compare to this beauty! It's worth driving past the few other stores in the area. Everyone who worked there that we came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. If nothing else come enjoy the cool air conditioning and sample some sushi!

In town visiting for a few days and my Mom was excited to have us try out the "new spot" in town. I'm not sure how people aren't a fan of the coffee - I thought it was amazing and was talked into having it after hearing the rave reviews about it. Apparently it's their own bean and they sell it (along with mugs, granola, and some other goodies) at the front of the restaurant.   Amber was our server and she was super friendly and patient with us. We had to do some plate shuffling to keep out of my little one's reach and she helped hold food and plates for me until we got organized. I was trying to be quick and she kept telling me to take my time and not to worry! My husband had to meet us there 15 minutes after us to finish up some work but we were able to order food for the baby and read up on the menu in the mean time. They have clean high chairs (although, strangely they're on wheels) and just a random note to parents - they don't have whole milk. I almost randomly brought some from home but didn't...so we had to settle for 2%. I told her what I was debating getting him for lunch and she told me that a la carte would be cheaper than ordering off of the kids menu. Everyone had breakfast except for me - I had the California Club - which was decent; my only gripe is that bun was a bit too bready and yet at the same time not long enough (or cut evenly enough) for everything to fit on there. My turkey was authentic fresh carved deli meat - not the usual processed stuff you'd generally get from most places.  It was a lot of food so the other half came home with me; along with half of the scrambled egg and strawberries for my 1 year old.   My Mom's husband said his eggs were a bit overcooked this time around and my husband said his hashbrowns were a bit under cooked but my mom's omelette and the rest of the food was good. I don't live here so I won't be frequenting the place but I'd certainly come back and I'm sure when I visit we will come by again. I didn't see the bill so I can't comment on the price, however it did seem like a lot of their items are super fresh and wholesome.
