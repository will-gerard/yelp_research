Kristin C.'s review prompted a review from me! I *heart* the Phoenix Zoo.  I volunteered here while in high school.  I went on an awesome tour with the zoo's veterinarian when I thought I wanted her job (I learned that I prefer just loving my dog and visiting zoos).  The people who work here are amazing and love sharing knowledge about the animals. I live in Chicago now, and though LP Zoo is pretty cool, I much prefer the Phoenix Zoo.  The animal habitats are bigger - so you don't always see as many animals, but I like knowing that the critters are running about and are not cramped into little cages.  The Phx Zoo offers so many educational opportunities for kids (the summer camp is great!!!) and fun events for adults, too.  If you really like the zoo, check into getting a membership, you help out animals and get to skip the lines for buying tickets! Definitely follow Kristin C's advice and wear comfy shoes, sunscreen, and drink lots of water - the zoo is huge and you will be walking quite a bit.  My favorite part is the AZ trail, it is so cool to see the animals that are native to our part of the country, and the exhibits are really well done.  Go check it out!

I totally agree with L.C.'s review.  Going to XCP made college seem like a breeze.  Yes, there were the typical high school dramatics, but I feel like the teachers were able to take a harder line on discipline, since they weren't in fear of getting in hot water with the public school district.  I had an overall great experience here, and I love meeting people all over the country that have gone to Xavier.  My last flight home, the person in the seat next to me went there, and we had tons of people/things to chat about.  It's fun to see where everyone has ended up, and it is fun to get together with fellow alums for drinks here in Chicago, and when I am back home in AZ.  I think it is so sad that the girls don't get to do freshman swimming, sophomore dances, or go to dockers anymore - those were some defining moments of my XCP career.  I don't know much about other private schools cropping up in the growing valley, but if I had kids, they would be headed to Xavier and Brophy!

More like 3.5 stars - wish Yelp would offer that option!  I would never have stopped at Sakana if a friend had not taken me there.  Located in a typical AZ strip mall, it looks unimpressive from the outside.  Inside, it is small, fairly uninteresting, but comfortable.  You can sit at the bar or at one of several tables.  Service was slow, but friendly.  We ordered the gyoza, which was delicious.  Often gyoza seems to be served cooler than I would prefer, but this was hot and well-flavored and delicious.  I had in mind Chicago-sized rolls, so we ordered 4 rolls for dinner.  Waaaay too much food - 2 rolls would have been fine.  The special rolls of the day are on a board by the sushi bar, and the server didn't tell us about them, so I am glad I asked.  The spicy tuna was nothing spectacular, but the spicy crunch California roll was delicious, as was the Tootsie roll and the specialty of the night.    Gyoza, 4 rolls, 2 large Japanese beers for a grand total of $48.  I was shocked - again, I am used to Chicago prices.  What a deal!!!  If I lived in AZ, I would definitely frequent this place, well-priced, casual, comfortable sushi.  Not flashy or trendy or a good place to "see and be seen", if that is your thing, better off in Old Town - this is just good sushi.

Note to management:  please bring Houston's back to Chicago, please??? I live in Chicago - but every time I am in AZ I stop in to Houston's at least once (OK, at least twice, and the first time is generally right after my plane lands).  I am a Houston's junkie.  I also used to work here in high school - but that bias has totally worn off.  And you know what?  If you worked somewhere and *still* want to eat there, the place must be doing something right. . . What is that something?  The smoked salmon appetizer, the spinach dip, the Arnold Palmer's with fresh squeezed lemonade, the Greyhounds with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, the ribs (*drool*), the key lime pie, the apple cobbler, the fries with a side of mustard honey sauce, all of the salads - should I keep going? As you can see, I love this place.  It is a classic.  Consistently top-notch service (the servers actually adhere to the customer right-of-way rule, know lots about the food, and accommodate any reasonable request, and the bartenders seem to know every patron by first name and favorite drink).  The prices seem to have crept up a bit - but I just don't mind because the positives outweigh the price.   I *heart* Houston's.  This location is a bit more low-key than the Esplanade, though in the winter and spring you should expect a wait of 30-60 minutes, as they do not accept reservations. All in all, delicious food, crisp service, and a comfy setting.  I miss you, Houston's!!!

The food is above average, but it is not especially innovative or creative.  They use quality ingredients in standard combinations for a tasty product.  The tuna tartare was a standout, I had a venison special that was merely good. The waiter couldn't answer a few questions about the food and went to check for me.  I generally expect a little more familiarity with the food at "upscale" places.   You are definitely being upcharged for the view and the setting - but for a special dinner, it is worth it, because the view and setting are pretty killer. Stop by the Jade bar before or after dinner - it is my fave place in AZ for drinks.

Well, it is actually on Mummy Mountain, not Camelback, just a minor clarification . . . And the desert landscaping is beautiful.  I love that the resort management realizes that AZ is indeed a desert and has landscaped accordingly! Anyway - I grew up down the street from this place, and I consider it a relaxing daytime getaway.  My mom and I spent the day here today, and I am oh so relaxed - and I feel spoiled, but in a good way. Definitely get to the spa early and work out in the gym - it is a nice gym, and you won't feel so guilty for being pampered later.   Remember your bathing suit!  They have a great pool area to relax in, and I somehow manage to forget my bathing suit 70% of the time. Everyone here offers you water - drink it!  Not only are you in the desert, but massages can be intense for your body, seriously, drink extra water. Try the signature facial - it is pricey ($145) but you get a facial PLUS a hot stone massage for your arms and legs while the goop on your face is sinking in - so it is a facial and a massage in one.  It is by far my favorite treatment here - I think I caught myself snoring at one point.  Plus, my skin looks *amazing* - all dewy and pretty. The hot stone body massage is also fantastic - the full version of the hot stone treatment.  Pure bliss, again, I always fall asleep for this one.  Warm, smooth river stones just about everywhere?  Sign me up! I had the Swedish massage today - I needed it because my shoulders and back have been sore lately, so I really enjoyed it.  My mom much preferred her hot stone treatment, and says she will not get another Swedish massage.   All in all, if you have some deep muscle issues, go Swedish, otherwise, go hot stone. We also had manicures and pedicures - fantastic!  My feet are so pretty! Beware, the cafe closes at 3 pm, so if your treatment is ending after that, you will be grouchy and hungry (ahem, like me).  Try some of the tasty spa food before 3 pm - you will be glad! Is it expensive?  Absolutely.  Is it worth it?  If you are someone who enjoys being pampered and feeling like royalty for a day, absolutely. And boys, if you have a lady in your life, put down the blender/coffee maker/vacuum cleaner you were planning on getting her for a gift and splurge on a spa day gift certificate.  She will definitely give you the benefit of her newly discovered massage techniques later on! Minus one star for the giant disappointment of no food after 3pm without any sort of warning.

I visited Fleur de Lys for my birthday this summer.  I had the BEST dining experience ever!  I went to Aureole the year before for my birthday - and hands down, Fleur de Lys was the better of the two.  My boyfriend and I live in Chicago - so when he called ahead, he made sure to tell them how much we miss foie gras - and we really appreciated all of the personalized touches the staff went out of their way to provide - my birthday dessert was divine.  The sommelier was fantastic, our server was so friendly and definitely knew her cuisine.  The food was absolutely phenomenal.  I really appreciate places where the staff is friendly and personable and not too formal, but still very attentive to detail.  Perfect balance of great service without stiffness.  The chef was gracious, introducing himself to every table but not puffing his own ego.  We really appreciated the kitchen tour - it is a beautiful space.  All in all, Fleur de Lys is my top choice in Vegas, and I hope I can go back before my next birthday.

So, my dad took me here today and billed it as an "upscale Houston's."  I think not. This place is a total Houston's rip-off.  Seriously, the decor is the same, the smell when you walk in is the same, the servers' outfits, the menu, the drinks, the silverware - I guess you see the point. So I ask the server, "are you affiliated with Houston's?"  He goes off on a story about how the WCG is an original concept and much better than Houston's - yada yada, save it for someone who isn't an aficionado of the Houston's persuasion. If you are going to say all of that, and clearly be a rip-off of my *favorite* restaurant, then you had better live up to the name.  And frankly, they don't.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad with mango and avocado (surprisingly, Houston's has the EXACT SAME SALAD - only better).   It was good, as I was jonesing for some tuna - but I could have done without the heavy sesame crust and the drenching with dressing.  My dad has the rotisserie chicken, and was so disappointed that they ended up taking it off of the bill (it was cold and dry).  We both had fresh-squeezed Arnold Palmer's - and they had ooky sugar-coated rims.  No thanks. The french fries were excellent, yay french fries.  Oh, and surprisingly, you can get them with mustard-honey dressing, just like at Houston's - though again, it wasn't as good. You know, it is probably a 3-star restaurant, but I was so put-off by the whole "we aren't Houston's and that restaurant sucks" attitude - when they are so clearly trying to be Houston's, that I will not ever be back.  If I want Houston's I will get the real thing, and it will taste better. Plus, I think the name is super lame.  The service was fine, the place is fine - but just go get the real thing, it is worth the wait.  **UPDATE** I upped my star rating to 3 because the GM contacted me and explained a bunch about the restaurant.  I really appreciate such personalized customer service - he certainly didn't have to be so nice.  So, I will try WCG again and hopefully pull the rating up another star!  I still think the name is funny . . .  ** ANOTHER UPDATE ** I was harassed by a fellow "reviewer" of the WCG who was clearly affiliated with the restaurant.  This "reviewer" has no other reviews and is a bit fishy.  I do not appreciate being contacted to argue about the experience I had and this type of activity destroys the integrity of Yelp.  I will not be returning to WCG and neither will anyone I know in AZ (they will all be hearing this story!).  Plus, we like Houston's better, anyway, so this will not be a loss!

This 2 star rating is an average of two visits . . . First visit: My birthday dinner.  My friends own a restaurant in Chicago - so they called ahead to let the staff know a table full of chefs were coming in for a b-day.  You know right there that we received an amazing menu, and top-notch service.  12 courses of completely phenomenal food - attention to detail was ridiculous, catering to my food allergies and my  friend's vegetarian lifestyle (which is expected at a place like Aureole, but they were above and beyond my expectations).  This was a 5-star visit - everything was absolutely PERFECT. Second visit: One year later.  I had my birthday dinner at Fleur de Lys (posted a review for that, as well).  The next night, my boyfriend and I decided to visit Aureole for dessert and wine.  It was not quite 10 pm when we arrived and were told unceremoniously by the hostess (before she even said hello) that they were closed.  I could see people still on beginning courses of their meals - so I knew that at least the pastry chef was still around.  We asked if we might sit at the bar and just have a dessert wine, she huffed and said "Fine."  The bar area was full but not crowded or hectic.  We were simply ignored by the bartender for several minutes - he finally came over and we asked what dessert wines, ports, etc. were available.  He said "just one" and poured 2 glasses, then left us alone again [he was not in the weeds, nor even close to busy enough to justify such treatment].  One dessert wine???  In all of Aureole?  Come on.  We caught his attention again and asked if we could still order dessert, he seemed surprised that we thought we couldn't (thanks hostess).  Dessert was fine, not spectacular, and we sat and watched every other bar patron receive better service than us.  I was so disappointed, we left quickly, wishing we had tried dessert somewhere else. Perfect example of why NOT to dismiss a young, well-dressed couple - we love food, I have worked in restaurants for years, and generally know what type of service/food I should get for my dollar.  This was a total disappointment, and I have told everyone I know to try other Vegas restaurants instead - this one has turned the corner from "perfect" to "pretentious".
