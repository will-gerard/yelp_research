Reviews are not that good, but I felt our lunch was very good. Service was highly attentive, and our pastas were flavorful. Good sauce, both the tomato meat sauce and the clam sauce were good. Bread was very average, but the spumoni made up for it!

First stop on our pub crawl. Great service, nice vibe, and plenty of choices. Their brewer is out of town but we still enjoyed all the great beer they had to offer. The food was good pub fare and the root beer was some of the best I've ever tasted. Inside is cozy, and the patio was quite pleasant.

I've been here before and received the same dismal and uninterested service both times. Sad. Our group was here for Sunday NFL breakfast and though the Bloody Mary bar looked tempting, no one imbibed. We went for the beer specials, which were good. The breakfast burrito was also tasty, but I seriously cannot get past your horrible horrible service.

The sushi here is amazingly delicious, super fresh, and there are a wide variety of choices. Miso soup is also quite nice as are the gyoza dumplings. This small (ish) place was hopping on a Friday night and we were happy to have reservations for our party of eight. We arrived about a half-hour early prepared to have a drink from the bar and wait for our 6:30 reservation. The hostess was not happy about this. I'm not sure why since we spent plenty of money at the bar AND we sat outside in the late afternoon summer heat. But her displeasure continued when she sat us as well. If the first person you meet in a restaurant is not friendly and welcoming, it sets a bad tone. Our wait staff was efficient and friendly however, and all was quite tasty. We'll revisit Moto because of the food and service, certainly not from the less than welcoming vibe upon entry.

Absolutely delicious!! This great downtown Phoenix mainstay has terrific chow and incredibly attentive service. We were warmly greeted and seated, and within minutes our server was taking our drink orders. PCG has a lovely wine list and beer menu with a few tasty cocktails as well. For an appetizer we had the recommended corn cakes with chicken, queso, and beans - superb... a hint of sweet and savory. Four different diners - four different dinners between us and each one tastier than the first. Black and blu burger with bacon on a soft burger bun was good (but a bit dry.) The chicken special was fresh and light and flavorful. The Idaho trout was delicate and perfectly complemented the roasted cauliflower and asparagus. And the pork chop was a huge mass of yum! We shared the bread pudding which was probably one of the best I've ever had. This place does get crowded and I would definitely recommend a reservation.  YUM.

This review is for Afternoon Tea with Jeffrey. Maybe I've reviewed it before... can't remember, can't find it. But here goes ... it was magical. I love that they change up the tidbits every so often to keep things fresh and new. The tea savories are twists on the old faves - salmon on a mini-blini, curried egg salad in tiny egg cups, and walnut chicken salad in a teeny-tiny bread box. The scones are buttery-rich and flavorful, especially slathered with lemon curd, raspberry jam, and Devonshire cream. Petit fours are marvelous - chocolate cake with ganache, vanilla-lavender cake, raspberry macaron with dark chocolate filling, and more. The service is incredibly attentive and Jeffrey is the ultimate host. Hurry on in before the Ritz changes hands though. It's a delightful way to spend an afternoon.

Always great service, lovely ambience, great wine selection, and appies that can't be beat. The bruschetta is delicious, the meat platter is divine, and the cheese plate delights my palate. Our party of 10 had a very enjoyable evening here with extremely attentive service. I can't ever say 'no' to Postino's. Ever!

Love this place and always find something to bring home. The people here are the friendliest and most helpful salespeople around. They know where everything is and dig out stuff from the back if they think they can help you. Love the selection and the prices too.

I cannot believe it has taken me 19 years of living in Phoenix to get out to The Farm. The breakfast at Morning Glory Cafe is unbeatable, truly. My omelette with fresh veggies and crispy potatoes were so flavorful, but that little buttermilk biscuit was dynamite. Nice homemade jam to go with it too. My mom had the waffle and it was so fluffy, crispy on the outside, and some plump juicy fresh fruit on top. I can't wait to go back and try the French toast! Wait staff is friendly and the get-your-own drink station is clever and easy. The ambience is so nice here, and sitting outside with out-of-town guests was a true pleasure. Thanks to you!!!

When the cashier said we'd be addicted after our first visit, she wasn't kidding! We shared the taco combination plate and the steak nachos. I can only say - Delish!!! The steak for the nachos was smoky and char-grilled with flavor sitting aboard the crunchy chips, salty beans, excellent pico de gallo, and some incredible guacamole. The combo tacos were quite good as well. We tried two pork varieties and one steak and we were not disappointed. These street tacos on corn tortillas are just up my alley. I didn't try the rice - that's up to you. Service was quite good and prompt at high noon on a Wednesday. The tables were clean and so was the restroom, which is a major plus. Let's keep them in business!!

Another visit to one of my favorite lunch-time haunts with my Zach. Can't stop trying the nachos, but have also branched out and tried the lengua tacos (yum) and some of the other specialties on the menu. I haven't been disappointed yet, and the place is always packed at lunchtime. So much better than most of the fast Mexican places out there and quite good prices. Once a week is not enough :).

Right away - I must tell you that we visited on Valentine's Day and that may make a difference to many readers. The place was packed though our table was ready as per our reservation. We were here to celebrate a major milestone birthday and I had requested notice of such. It never happened, even after I reminded the wait staff. We were surrounded by couples celebrating an evening of Love and the music from the bar worked nicely to set the mood. Service was inattentive, and I felt that not being a regular actually hurt our chances of having a decent meal. Our waiter knew just about everyone else around us and extra helpings of bread and the like went out to them. The food was meh. Decent Italian, but I think I could do the same plates justice at home. Again, I realize it was a special night with a special menu, but warmed over pasta just wasn't that special. I've heard good things about Ruffino's over the years but probably won't dare a second visit.

Every time I walk into this place I am reminded of how easily places come and go around Phoenix. This place continues to stay and for good reason. The food is hot and fresh and flavorful. If you want it spicy - you got it. If you don't - you got that too. During the lunch-time rush the food arrives quickly so if you're in a hurry, you're welcome. This place is clean and even my momma (soooo picky) loved it.

First timers to Waffle House and we couldn't have been happier. A warm welcome and hello from several employees started this visit off in a terrific way. Lola was friendly and efficiently seated her guests - we waited just about 15 minutes on a Sunday morning in February, Valentine's Day actually. The food smells delicious here and it was. We sat at the high bar after being graciously invited forward by the head chef. Our pecan waffle was cooked to perfection and studded with pecans, warmed over with maple syrup. The hash browns were delectable - cooked crispy brown and filled/topped with our choices - ham, tomatoes, cheese... yum. We couldn't be happier with this first visit and now it won't be our last!!

Service was good here amidst a bit of a crowd but the food came hot and fast. I unfortunately didn't care much for the flavors of the spicy pho or the amount of shellfish throughout the menu (allergies.) The menu was a bit challenging to decipher but that's my problem, not theirs. I'm sure others out there may love this place, but I probably won't go back. Tummy issues....

This swanky little sushi bar was just the ticket on a Tuesday evening for Happy Hour. Shhhhh, don't tell everybody or it'll get too crowded. But wait... Tell everybody so they stay open. Everything was absolutely delicious and fresh as can be. We sat at the bar and watched our chef wrap and roll like nobody's business. I can't wait to go back. Best sushi in this area for sure.

I've been here more than a dozen times and it's hit or miss for me. This time was a big hit. I loved their oatmeal with fruit, nuts, brown sugar and the like. It's McCann's original and quite good. My friends enjoyed their various pancakes and breakfast scrambles. The service was very attentive on a weekday, which we really appreciated. The benches are so uncomfortable though... hate that part of visiting here. I'll be back.

We haven't been here for awhile but were SO happy to revisit. Our meal from start to finish was top-notch and our server couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. Darn, I wish I could remember his name - a clever nickname that I swore I'd remember. Oh, well - he was amazing. Our fresh guacamole was terrific and that cornbread is always cooked to perfection. Can't get enough! Our margaritas were dynamite too. I ordered the ruby trout and it was spectacular. Loved the sides as well. My friend ordered the stacked enchilada and that was flavorful too. I don't think you could go wrong with just about anything on this menu. Oh, and Happy Hour prices are very affordable. Thanks!!

I think that BJ's is a hit-and-miss kind of place. Today was just meh. We three gals were out to lunch before a movie at the Chandler Mall location. The menu is huge, the TV's are on with sports action, the drinks were cold, service is adequate, and the food is too. We all had salads - three different salads actually. I had the ahi tuna and though the tuna was plentiful throughout, the tuna was way too peppery and the salad was soggy. One of my friends had the Thai chicken mango salad with the dressing on the side, which made it a lot less goopy. My other friend had the honey crisp chicken salad but the chicken was missing-in-action. It sure didn't look like the picture. Our server was unfamiliar with the menu and couldn't answer our questions. Maybe she was new? I know that it's tough to be a waiter/waitress and they sure do work hard. But hey, a smile and some friendly service goes a long way with me.

Worst Mani-Pedi Ever! We stopped in on a week-day afternoon with out of town guests wanting a quick fix for nails and toes. Ew. Filthy dirty store and if I get a fungus I will NOT be surprised. Ew... again. My fingers are sore and cut around the cuticles and my nail polish on my toes came off the very next day. And, the manicurists were yelling at each other back and forth with no regard for clients. They kept talking about other salons where the manicurists don't speak English. Very unpleasant, sarcastic, and demeaning atmosphere. Cheap, for sure ... but you get what you pay for. Awful Awful Awful.  Oh, and no putting your tip on your credit card either as if I was going to leave one....

Really good bagels, friendly owners and workers, and clean too. I really enjoyed listening to the owner wandering around visiting with customers and their children. If you bring your children I think I saw a little lego'style play area. We had the deluxe lox and bagel breakfast and it was quite tasty. Loved the old-timey pics on the wall near the bathroom. This place smells warm and cozy and a little bit New York from the moment you walk in the door. Oh, and the cinnamon crunchy bagel chips were just this side of heaven.

How is it that I have lived here for almost 20 years and this is the first time I have stopped into Byblos? They have been here - neighborhood local - for almost 30 years! The owner stopped by while we were enjoying a delicious dinner of moussaka, hummus, babaganouche, tomato soup, and the lamb special. Every bite was incredibly fresh and delicious. Don't skip out before having dessert - the tiramisu and honey pudding were incredible. Oh, and the Turkish Coffee - great flavoring with the cardamom. Stop in and say hello - they'll love you for it and your tummy will thank you.

We really enjoyed Top of the Rock - haven't been here in years and took our out-of-town company for an enjoyable evening. The service was just fair, but the view is spectacular. The food was quite good. Our steaks were cooked to our liking, and the crispy chicken was quite a hit. Our cocktails were mixed very well, and the presentation of both food and drink was very nice. I'd come again for a visit, but expect to pay for the privilege.

Your web site stated 1/2 priced appetizers and $3.50 martinis and still you refused, stating there was a different Happy Hour Menu. Your sign out front said 40% off between 4pm and 6pm. Still no consideration. All this after we ordered and ate your mediocre appetizers and your waiter told us there was no problem. You even double-checked your web site and still did not reconsider. Business must be pretty good for you to turn away loyal neighborhood customers. And the food wasn't even that good. Sorry Marcello's ... that was your last chance.

We received a terrific estimate from Cohl and work proceeded on our pool, spa, and cool-deck remodel. Thunderbird Pools was the only company that could see their way to my vision and I appreciated that. The spa was filled in, the cool-deck was repainted, and the pool was done in Pebble-Tec. Unfortunately, our pool had many splotchy marks and white chunks of unmixed cement. We worked with Cohl and his sub-contractors afterwards for several months. This process was a bit of a challenge but Thunderbird, Cohl & Lisa all stood firmly that the pool needed to be redone. We went ahead and had the pool redone by the sub-contractor and today (a few months later) it is finally complete. And what a gorgeous pool it is!! I do appreciate the effort put in and emphasize that if you have a problem, you MUST take it back to Thunderbird. They worked to make it all right and it is. Use their company with confidence.

It doesn't get any better than this. Sunday morning wait time for a party of 8 was only about 25 minutes. The scent of those heavenly waffles and crispy fried chicken was wafting through the parking lot and waiting area, driving us nuts! We tried just about everything again this morning sharing deliciously crispy fried chicken that was moist and tender; flavorful waffles with lots of butter and maple syrup; coarse ground grits that are just this side of perfection; sweet candied yams with enough brown sugar to melt your bitter away; green beans with just a touch of spice and some red potatoes; and that velvety banana pudding. Oh my land! Service from Chris and his crew was some of the best we've ever had. Keep it up Lolo's and we'll keep coming back again and again and again.

I've reviewed you before and every time I visit I am more in love with you. Yesterday's meal couldn't have been any better. How is the food so fresh, hot, and delicious time after time after time? Service is amazing as always and the fried chicken was on point. Our sides - candied sweets (wow!) homey grits, spicy green beans and red beans over rice were all terrific too. If only fried chicken were fat free..... Love you Lolo's!!

Oh Wow - SO yummy. This place is quite packed for lunch, but totally worth the wait. Wonderfully prepared pho with tons of meaty/veggie flavor. The extra basil and toppings were so fresh. We also enjoyed the fresh spring rolls. Yum - I  cannot wait to drop in again.

I have lived in Phoenix for 19 years now and have never been to Mary Coyle's. What a pity! I have long wanted to visit but just never got around to getting there. I realize that they are under new ownership, so it may be different than it was before. No matter to me. The service was friendly and efficient and the ice cream was absolutely wonderful. Great ice cream, delicious hot fudge, and fun. What more can you ask for??

This local yum spot had me from the moment I walked thru the front door. Sparkling clean counters, and a friendly greeting. You'll see their delicious gelato in the case near the register and delectable pastries to your right upon entering. But the best part of this visit were the tortas themselves. I had the Torta Paquime traditional with grilled carne asada, fresh avocado, lettuce, and a crisply toasted bun. My son had a smothered torta with slices of tender pork and a flavorful sauce. Love the beverage choices too! We will be back.

We've been here for 20 years and this was our first trip out to Saguaro Lake. Seriously, what is wrong with us? It is absolutely gorgeous out there and the Desert Belle Cruise last Saturday evening was beautiful. The sun was setting, the lake was calm, and the piano player was magical. I don't know his name but his music truly made the trip. I cannot wait to bring friends and family down here for another round sometime soon. Lovely, simply lovely. Oh, and make reservations - it was packed.

We haven't been here for years and now I remember why. The food is mediocre at best. Though service was exemplary and I have to give them that. The pasta was bland and the meat sauce - also bland. I did have a good salad, but then I find that hard to mess up. We also tried the fried asparagus appetizer and it was interesting. I do love asparagus, but whatever vinegary sauce they used, it killed the taste of the asparagus itself. My tablemates had the meat-lovers pizza and said it was pretty good. Hence the 2-stars and not a 1-star from me. Again, service was very good. But I won't be back. Sorry.

Year after year I visit the Renaissance Festival and love it every single time. Thanks to my darling daughter, we had period dress and that makes it even more fun. The crowds were serious this past Sunday but I never felt put out. The craftspeople who bring their own works of art are a highlight for me. I love seeing what they have brought to share. Can't miss the Tory-Steller or Hey Nunnie Nunnie either. So hilarious. Catch yourself a turkey leg and pet the greyhounds. It's good for ye!

Friday evening and our foursome stopped in for dinner and drinks. The margaritas here are amazing. Sweet and liberally dosed with a salty bite. Try the house gold - couldn't be more delicious. The chips and salsa are quite good - very crispy thick tortilla chips with salsa that is just spicy enough. Every single one of our entrees were delicious. We tried four different plates - seafood tacos, smothered burritos, mole, and a torta. Yum. You can't go wrong with a visit here and the service is quick and gracious.

Hoosier Cafe - I know you've got a ton of regulars and the line is out the door and up the block on the weekends so we stopped in on a Monday morning. Excellent service and friendly waitstaff. Loved our French Toast, no we really really loved our French Toast. The omelette breakfast was good too, but the plain old scrambled eggs were plain old scrambled eggs. My fault. A teeny bit of a problem with the bacon for our skillet breakfast, but what the heck? Everything else was good enough to make a return visit.See ya next time!

This Phoenix favorite has left me wanting more. The ambience is warm and cozy, the happy hour menu is very nice with some of their house specialties included, the food is superb, and the service is fabulous. We sat in the outside bar area with a lovely fire nearby and the heaters blazing warmth with a nice chill in the outside air. Our server was amazing - great personality and perfect recommendations for us. We started with some happy hour favorites - fish tacos and pork wings with a few beers and a glass of wine. Our party of four was ready for the meal - scallops for my friend (grilled perfectly and flavored delicately); filet for her hubby (also cooked to perfection with a nice salty tang); my hubby had the ny strip - (huge cut of perfectly grilled steak); and I had the cioppino (loaded with monkfish, scallops, mussels, and lobster broth). To say the meal was amazing is an understatement. I would eat anything off that menu! Our dessert included their house pecan pie (loaded with chocolate chips & toffee bits) - a super decadent example of pecan pie with a buttery flaked crust. Our friends had the huckleberry cheesecake which was good but not as good as the pie with salted caramel ice cream. You must not pass this up! All in all, a perfect evening at Roaring Fork. Thanks guys!

Tucked away in the back of a little strip mall and looking like a sports bar - yep, that's what it is. There are TV's along two sides of the big bar area, and a patio as well. Breakfast on Sunday mornings for football goes pretty quick, so get there early. They stop serving at 11:15 am. Saw the steak and eggs across the table and they both looked good. I tried the hash browns and they were awful. I ordered the Frisco burger and couldn't have been happier. Great juicy burger with lots of flavor and delicious fries on the side. Hubs had the wings and said they were amazing. Pizza was also on our table but didn't get a lot of love. People said it was just okay. The service was okay, not stellar, but not bad either. San Tan Brewery's Railslide was the beer of the month and that's pretty amazing too. Try it.

Yum and Yum. I've lived here for 21 years and this is the first time to Frank & Lupe's. What a waste of the time I've missed. Great beans folks for starters - I mean great beans!! Typical Mexican fare off the menu but cooked perfectly without too much grease or fuss. Good chips and salsa, though you must ask for another basket. Attentive staff in a cozy space in Old Town. I can't wait to get back!

This lovely restaurant from executive chef Beau MacMillan is set inside the Sanctuary Resort between on the north side of Camelback Mountain. The resort looks gorgeous and might make a lovely overnight getaway or honemoon retreat. We live in the area, so we were here to celebrate a birthday dinner. The little bar (Jade) has friendly service and super-high top tables. I did have trouble climing up and down in a short dress. Our martinis were excellent - I had the 11th Generation Martini with gin, raspberry, peach tea, and honey; and hubby had the Blood Orange Basil with grey goose. They were both tasty, but his was better. We shared the spiced edamame and they came with quite a kick. Tasty, salty, and spicy. Our table was a lovely little booth for two and as the sun set, it made for quite a spectacular view overlooking the resort and valley towards the north. My dinner choice was the double cut pork chop with sweet potatoes. The maple glaze on the chop was quite good, but it was a bit tough through the interior. The sweet potatoes were way too salty. Soft, flavorful, but even my salt-lovin' hubby said it was too much. He had the chilean sea bass which was perfect. Flaky white fish in a great broth with bok choy. We shared the pork-belly fried rice which was a true hit. Birthday desert with a candle was their signature peanut butter chocolate bomb. The peanut butter creme was a luscious delight covered with a rich chocolate shell. Service was pretty good considering their was only one server in our entire area. There were two assistants helping her out, but we felt a bit neglected at times for water refills, etc. All around, a good meal. Pricy, spicy, but good. Oh, and make reservations!

In 20 years of living in the Valley of the Sun I have always wanted to get myself a Soleri Bell. Well, I finally did it. Looked up the place, found out it was much closer than I thought, and visited with my out of town company. We all purchased a bell and couldn't be happier with their look and tone. The people here are artisans and super friendly to boot. We enjoyed watching a bronze pour while visiting and even on a 100 degree day, it didn't feel too warm outdoors. Hit them up!

This review is for the spa only at this resort, I did NOT spend the night.  The spa... aaahhh.... very relaxing to begin our morning of services. We were warmly welcomed and checked in by the gracious host. Armed with robes, slippers, and razors, we were escorted into the massive locker/changing area. Clean, but older, the area contains lockers, changing rooms, showers, restrooms, and prep stations for make-up and hair following treatments. Around the corner there is a lovely indoor jacuzzi tub, outdoor pool, cabanas, and quiet areas both inside and out. This space is uber relaxing and I absolutely loved it. The chaise lounges are comfy-cozy with soft blankets if needed. My massage treatment was spectacular, soothingly administered by an experienced therapist who worked my shoulder knots like a champ. Thanks so much!!! But, my mani/pedi were just average. My nail beds and cuticle areas still sting today. I have a blister on my thumb and when she rubbed the salt treatment all over my hands I about screamed. She even mentioned that she had seen the open sore. I found the treatment hurried and a tad insensitive. Lunch at Sprouts was absolutely delightful. Love the calorie count on the varied items - the seared ahi tuna and smoked salmon ciabatta were both quite good. The maple-buttermilk dressing on the faux Caesar salad was creamy and tangy. Very nice. All in all, a truly lovely experience that I will repeat again when I can. Maybe a facial or wrap instead of the nail treatments though...

I can't imagine that this venerated old steakhouse needs any further review but here I am. Great service, I mean really truly attentive service. Lovely ambience and a menu that cannot be beat. The price is ridiculous ($52 for a cowboy rib-eye) but absolutely delicious. The steaks are amazingly prepared and the sides are served family style. We tried three different salads and they were all good. We shared the lyonnaise potatoes, which were cooked to crispy perfection and the steamed asparagus with hollandaise. Good hollandaise too. We skipped out on dessert this time and shared a little wine instead. Lovely, perfect, delicious.

Stopped in here for a quick bit of breakfast while shopping for a Rehearsal Dinner venue. The service was charmingly elegant and efficient and the food... oh my. The Monkey Bread is sweet and baked to perfection with a caramel sauce you cannot imagine. The short rib hash with an egg atop was a meaty concoction that assured we wouldn't go hungry all day. Sitting outside in the Arizona winter sunshine - Heaven on Earth. I'll be back.

On a super crowded Sunday during football season, Four Peaks still delivers. Great service, cold local beer, and a good selection of better than average bar food. I had the breakfast burger with a large patty, topped with bacon, an egg, cheese, and jalapeño mayo. The bun was flavorful, and the burger itself was perfect. The potatoes were well seasoned too. Hubby had a white pizza with chicken and mushrooms. Great portions. We rode our bike here as do lots of other fans. This place favors the Vikings on SuNday mornings, so beware! Breakfast till 2pm, and good eats all day long. Thanks for the friendly service too.

Everybody I know loves Haji-Baba. For me it's just okay. I love Mediterranean food - veggies, hummus, babbaganouch (sp?) and all the rest. I just feel that the food here is mediocre. With as many choices as there are in the valley for finer food, this one ranks lower. If you're on a budget, however, this is your place. Great prices.

This little gem off of Mill Avenue in Tempe is such a delight. The two houses merge together with a lovely tree-shaded patio. It's perfect for groups or couples. Our party of three sat outside watching the revelers attend the ASU/Stanford game as there was a private party going on inside the houses. No matter, the weather was perfect and the heaters were warm enough. Our service was fair, to be honest and I would have preferred a little more attention and information regarding the menu. The food was amazing though. The filet actually melted in our mouths and was perfectly seasoned. It sat atop a delicious mixture of cheddar grits and veggies. The halibut was also nicely done and very flavorful. The best part of this meal was the amazing bread pudding dessert. You cannot skip this one filled with apples and the flavors of fall. The red velvet chocolate mousse cake was also good, but the bread pudding was better. Very nice wine list accompanies and the cocktails are quite good - try the salted old fashioned for a unique twist on the old favorite.

Last Saturday was a super-crowded spring afternoon in downtown Tempe. We interrupted the hostess staff as they huddled together in conversation. The young lady who greeted us was a bit put out - sorry about that, but we did have reservations. Once we stepped onto the patio at Caffe Boa and to our table however, the clamor and noise of the outside world disappeared. Our server was very good, filling our glasses of water, taking our order promptly, refilling our wine and chilling it too. The menu is lovely and the food was fabulous. The crispy chicken was the hit at our table with a delicate rosemary crisped skin. Inside - tender and juicy and delicious. The lasagna was also ordered - a giant portion of food, almost too much for the lady who ordered it. Smothered in a slightly creamy, very flavorful tomato sauce and oozing with cheese. The arugula salad was also large and nothing but arugula and goat cheese. A few other veggies would have been nice - all that arugula can be boring. I ordered the veal ragu but a veal chop appeared at my place. I was into the chop - it was alarmingly delicious and didn't have the heart to send it back. It was a slight error on our waitress  part and I enjoyed every moment of it. Desserts were the tiramisu (wonderful) and the adult s'mores tart (good, not great.) The espresso and chamomile tea were lovely to finish off the meal. This is my second time here and after the first time we swore not to return. Happily... I would come back again and again.

We had a truly delicious dinner here - salads, sammies, oysters, and the like. Service was particularly efficient and friendly. The bathrooms leave quite a bit to be desired though - come on. This historic location is super fun for groups or patio gatherings and the beer flows freely!!

This terrific little downtown gem was just the spot to fill us up after a visit to the local brewery. Their homemade vegetable soup was flavored with dill and quite good. The star of our lunchtime was the ham and potato casserole smothered in delicious Wisconsin cheese. Savory and melty and gooey and wonderful. But.... also too good to pass up was their pie. We shared the cherry-rhubarb and were glad we tried it. Rhubarb - a first for us Phoenicians, but very tasty. I'd eat a little less lunch next time just so I could have more pie. Great service too - thanks a bunch!!

This surprising little place near central Phoenix is tantalizingly delicious. As you drive in, please admire the artwork on the buildings and fence behind the restaurant. Amazing. We arrived about 10 minutes before our table-mates but were seated immediately. Our waiter was friendly and so helpful regarding our choices. We started out with the Barrio Bomba Margarita (me) and the Cadillac Margarita (him.) Very nicely iced and mine was rimmed with both sugar and salt - great combination. The bread here that comes with the olive tapenade is absolutely delicious - a wonderful start to our meal. Dinner for hubby was a small bowl of the posole before the Torta del Barrio, a roasted poblano pepper sandwich stuffed with oaxacan cheese. that posole is probably the best we've ever had. I had the Torta de Cochinita Pibil, a rich roasted pork sandwich topped with sweet purple onions. We both had the crunchy french fries on the recommendation of our waiter with the cocktail ketchup dip. Yum. We tried the kahlua chocolate caramel cake for dessert and it was fantastic. Just the right amount of sweet after a filling meal. The food here is so flavorful - not too spicy at all, just the right amount. It wasn't too crowded on a Sunday evening (thankfully) so we didn't have to wait long. They do not take reservations here either - first come, first served by a gracious staff. Get on over there and enjoy.

This was my second go-round here at Tee Pee Mexican Food, and this time wasn't that much different. I realize that this is a historical venue and has been around for a very long time. Great. The wait at lunchtime on a weekend before Christmas was not too bad. Our wait staff was quick and friendly. The salsa was very flavorful, but the bowl of chips (while hot) were some of the smallest and most broken-up chips we have ever seen. My green corn tamale came cold. Yes, cold. And the rice and beans were average. Hubby's carne asada burrito was better than my tamale but it wouldn't take much to get there. If you're desperate, come for the salsa and margaritas or a cold beer. But, that's about it.

Second time here and sooo awful. The sliders were bland and the fries weren't any better than Burger King. That's saying alot me thinks. And service at the bar was incredibly horrible. SO unfriendly, SO unhelpful, SO impersonal! We asked for the beer menu and were given dirty looks with our menu. What's up with that? I asked for one of the beers in the cold case from Dogfish Head - again the dirty looks and silence. I felt like I was in some sort of time warp here. Luckily the beer was cold, and I'd never pass up the Dogfish Head Raison d'etre. It's amazing. Skip the Burger Bar and go next door.

Wonderful experience! Classic service, friendly wait staff, perfectly mixed cocktails, and flavorful food. Our salads were absolutely perfect, the dressings on both were incredible. Our steaks were juicy and cooked to perfection - both of us got the rib-eye and all its flavorful goodness was all over the plate. I was however, surprised at the lack of ambiance in this place. It's got really nothing going for it but tables and good service and good food. I guess you don't need much more than that, but it's Vegas for goodness' sakes. Liven up the decor a bit! But go, please. You won't regret it.

This hotel smells like heaven (or Hawaii) throughout. What a restful, beautiful, and impressive place to stay amidst the hubbub of Las Vegas. I can't imagine staying anywhere else anytime soon. Staff is so gracious as well, and you don't come away smelling like an ashtray either.

Not sure what I can add that will convince you to visit but here goes. Great beers on tap - huge selection of all-Wisconsin beers. I wish I could have had a few more, but loved the Spotted Cow. The beer cheese soup with crunch popcorn tidbits was amazing, as was the fish and chips. Delicately battered and served with crunch fries. The cole slaw was perfectly seasoned with little celery seed bits - loved it. Service is fairly attentive but it's so darn busy, you won't be disappointed. This is a can't miss place in Mad-Town.

Wow! The rumors are absolutely true.Sooooo good!!! First time to FEZ and I have wanted to visit for quite a while. Their happy hour prices are quite nice and the bottled beer was frosty-cold. I had to have one of their burgers and was not disappointed. I had the Tangier Burger with hummus, herb pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, and manchego cheese. Got this not in their delicious ciabatta, but on romaine lettuce. So crisp, fresh, juicy, delicious. Side salad had a splash of their delicious homemade dressing too.  Hubby and son had the FEZ burger with spicy honey molasses bbq sauce, cinnamon pears, feta cheese, lemon aioli, crispy onions, and cilantro. They had theirs on the ciabatta bread and I had a bite or two for myself. Oh... man - so good. Their sweet potato fries are the best I have ever had and I try them everywhere I go.   Dear FEZ, we'll be back again and again.

Oh my goodness fabulous!!! Lunchtime visit with my gal pal and we had a wonderful time. Service was attentive, and the food was delectable. I had the Brussels Sprouts Salad and Cauliflower/Garlic Soup. The salad was fresh and green with tiny bacon bits throughout. The soup was vegan and pureed to a very creamy consistency. Great flavors. My friend had the swordfish tacos and that piece of fish was grilled to perfection. Lovely ambience sitting outside by the fire mid-week and not too terribly crowded. The little cookie on the way out the door really hit the spot too. Thanks Chelsea's Kitchen - I will be back!!

Thank goodness for Devoured Phoenix!! We learned about this place last spring at the food festival and couldn't be happier. This is probably, most definitely, my new favorite place in all of Phoenix. The food.... the service... the ambience... all of it. Hubs and I stopped in for brunch and enjoyed the griddled cinnamon roll spiced delicately with a great smear of creamy topping; the homestyle posole with tender chunks of pork and a green broth that will bring me back again and again; the pork tamale - I cannot say enough good things about this delicacy; and the breakfast enchiladas - yum!!! BTW, restrooms were super clean too. Don't dilly dally about, get there as quick as possible and enjoy their menu. I dare you not to love them.

The décor and ambience here is so nice. I loved the entire atmosphere and service was quite good. Breakfast here is such a treat with some wonderful choices. I definitely have to recommend the short rib breakfast - so flavorful. But... it is a very rich morning meal so beware. Outstanding experience - I'll return!

Our party of eight had a terrific dim sum brunch here last Saturday. The choices were plentiful, hot, and fresh-tasting. I love trying new items and this time we tried the fried chicken's feet and the seaweed salad. Both were something new and different for our entire table. Favorite item this time was the duck. It was tender and flavorful, almost like a dessert. Everything was good, and the service is stellar. Prices can't be beat. We ate and ate and ate and our bill was about $15 per person. Yum.

This might be one of the best meals I have ever eaten. Superb service combined with a divine menu of lovely little tidbits - everything from ahi tacos to a tongue stew, and everything in between. Check out their menu beforehand so you can figure out what you'd like to share. Ambience is so attractive and a good bar menu as well. Besides, the Mandalay Bay Resort is so beautiful, you'll want to come in just for a look-see.

We truly enjoyed our breakfast here - the pancakes were amazing ... fluffy and light, golden and scent-sational. The bacon and egg breakfast was also quite well done. Service was friendly and attentive, and the place was clean and well-placed within Mandalay Bay. A good little stop for us. If I may add though... no herbal tea was a surprise for me. Get some chamomile on the tea list at least. I had to use my own.

Quiet little place with an awesome eclectic jukebox, friendly service, and a pool table to boot. I could do without the creepy movie overhead, but that's just me. Retro cocktails were divine as well. I can definitely recommend you to all my pals. Enjoy!

Big Bang - you never let me down. We e-mailed you ahead of time and got our Happy Hour wristbands and free entrance for our party of seven. Thanks so much. Love the drink specials, the clean restrooms, and of course those terrific piano players. We were so pleased with our service - can't remember her name but boy she can belt out a rap song too. We'll be back.

Another jewel in the middle of our city that I had no idea existed. Openly hidden is what another reviewer wrote and I have to agree. As it stands just over the 10 Freeway and smack dab in the middle of downtown - such a lovely oasis. The $5 entry fee is a nominal bit to keep the gardens pristine. Lovely flora throughout, some healthy koi in the pond, and shaded pathways. There are a few smaller waterfalls and a sense of peacefulness throughout. Great spot to wander, take a break, have a bit of a picnic, or just relax. I bet it's gorgeous in early spring.

The food is just so darn good here and the ambience is pretty fun as well. Delicious schnitzels, sausages, wursts, and the roulade - ridiculously good. Our server was cheerful and helpful - thanks for the advice on the Kilometer sausages (best ever!) The beer was ice cold and the oompah music was a blast as well. Can't imagine a better place for German food.

Mac's... you're growing on me! I didn't like you so much at first but now - not only do I love your popular beer selection but your food has gotten better and better. Our party of six enjoyed (truly enjoyed) a burger, the chicken pecan salad, the salmon (yum), the ziti, a patty melt, and the fish/shrimp and chips. Everything was seasoned perfectly and flavored appropriately. Your wait staff even had a smile for us as we messed up our drink orders twice. We messed them up, not her!! Thanks so much for a great evening. We'll be back.

This very decent buffet filled us up quite nicely before the start of the Rock-n-Roll 1/2 Marathon. Expect the typical long lines for the omelette station and lots of people hovering near the pastries. The food was above-average for a buffet IMHO and we ate plenty. Service was a bit scarce but our juices and teas finally made their way to our table. OJ was fresh and tea choices were good enough. I would definitely go back if I needed a BIG breakfast.

Great food from this little place tucked away in a strip mall in Ahwatukee. We had a lovely lunch with friendly, helpful service. Starters were fantastic - full flavored vegetables including eggplant and zucchini, and some tomato bruschetta. I've had better bruschetta but this stuff seemed to work. Our party of six enjoyed a few different pasta dishes, mine was a great olive oil, tomato, and garlic delight. I'd definitely try this place again for dinner in the future.

If you're staying at Mandalay Bay or THE Hotel (or even if you're not) saunter down to The Café for breakfast. Delicious menu items like chicken & waffles, French toast, breakfast meats & eggs, etcetera. Service is quite good here and the whole place feels restful and serene.

I cannot believe that I haven't reviewed the fine food and ambience at Cornish Pasty Company. We've been visiting for a few years now and love the availability of cold beers, and unique pasty offerings. I love the Thanksgiving Pasty - turkey, stuffing, and sweet potatoes all rolled up in a luscious dough pocket. Their Little Bit of Salmon pasty is also very nice. We go in for the garlic fries and mushy peas as well - can't leave without my mushy peas!! This is a great spot for a snack if you want to share or a meal if you want your own pasty all to yourself. Cheers!!

This was the best lunch I have ever had at Yupha's. Great service, delicious smoky fried rice with delicate tofu, crispy orange chicken and soup & salad. Good prices and quick lunchtime turn-around. You can order your food as mild or spicy as you care to go here and that's a good thing. I don't know a lot of Thai restaurants that work for me, but this one surely does. Thanks Yupha's!

Talk about a hidden gem! This vibrant little place is tucked in a dance studio and what appears to be an art studio?? But, my oh my, what a delectable experience. The food is fresher than fresh and the service was personal and welcoming. Our party of four couldn't believe the endless cocktail menu with some pretty unique offerings. There is truly something for everyone, beer and wine to boot. The prickly-pear margarita was by far the BEST margarita I've ever had - thanks for that! Food - wow. They have a marvelously affordable social hour from 3-6pm with terrific choices. We shared the epenadas, the paella, and the cornbread smothered with chicken, resting on black beans. The short rib enchiladas were the hit of the table, but the pork pernil wasn't too shabby either. The seafood enchilada was a bit overdone, but that may be a personal choice. Loved the sides - gorgeously vibrant maple spicy carrots, fresh green beans, cheddary mashed potatoes, and that glorious cornbread. Don't miss it... or the chocolate chip bread pudding with malted crunch ice cream. Not sure how often their menu changes, but skip on over and give them a try. You will not be disappointed.

We were here for happy hour on a Saturday night and it wasn't too busy. The music was quite loud for conversation, but good if you want to party. The beer was ice-cold and the service was attentive. The bathrooms were filthy and the tables and table décor were sticky and dirty too. Ew. I can only imagine what it looks like behind the bar and in the kitchen. High marks for service and that's about it.

The high point of our meal was the cold mug that our beer came in. Worst food, worst service, and just plain ick. Not that clean here either. The service was slow and inefficient with messed up orders and confusion. The food was tasteless though hot. With so many choices out there, take my advice and skip this place. Your stomach will thank you later when you are not suffering like I did. One star for the ice cold beer.

The food here is so consistently good. The neighborhood-feel and welcoming vibe is so appreciated. I love how the owner wanders through the café all morning visiting with diners and thanking them for their patronage. We've had a couple different delicious breakfast items over the past few visits namely... the Eggs Benedict Florentine with fresh spinach, perfectly poached eggs, and a creamy Hollandaise that is not too salty or overdone. If you like a little heat, you may want to try the Arizona Omelette with a kick in the creamy sauce. For a sweet treat try the pistachio muffin - green on the inside in a good way! You'll find a crowd here on weekend mornings and a bit of a wait, but it's worth it. Our server did have a teeny-tiny bit of a bad mood on her, and that is a disappointment.

Great Sunday morning service and lots of tv's in this Chargers fan fave bar. Clean, friendly, and great bar specials. Breakfast flatbread to die for.. Do not miss this. Everything on the menu was actually very tasty except for the chicken fried chicken. Sorry. I would come back for sure, and hey... It will be sooner rather than later. Yummy food, great service, good bar specials, and clean!!!

Love this place for Sunday morning NFL breakfast. Thanks for bringing it back this year. Service here is phenomenal and the food was delicious. Loved the 'surfer special' with bacon, eggs, potatoes, and chocolate chip pancakes. Those pancakes are amazing. Our waitress was super attentive and helpful, and the bus service was extremely capable. Our entire party of 11 had a terrific time. Bloody Mary bar is every bit as good as it was last year, maybe better. And the mimosas are lovely too. Great vibe and excellent prices too. Thanks... see you again!!

YUM with a capital YUM. I was a bit surprised after reading the reviews to find this little gem in a strip mall. It's right by Lolo's, by the way. We walked in and the place smelled delish! We were seated immediately in a clean and comfortable booth. Our waiter took our order and answered all our questions. He did forget to bring our water even though we asked twice, but I forgave him that when I tasted the refreshing ginger limeade. We shared the veggie spring rolls - so fresh and minty! And we ordered three different bowls of pho. Amazingly flavored broths in the veggie and beef  bowls. I love how fresh the vegetables were and hubby loved the spice in the meatballs. My brother-in-law was a bit unhappy with the thinly sliced tendon but it wasn't on the menu initially and they made it all special for him. Thanks Noodles Ranch for putting up with my crabby brother-in-law by the way. Super tasty and we will definitely be back.

Picazzo's ... where have you gone? You used to be one of my favorite places to visit but you have fallen from grace. Service was good and I appreciate that but the food was sub-par. My salad arrived with a variety of greens that were not listed on the menu and my server apologizing for the substitution. You might have asked me if I wanted kale... I did not. That's why I didn't order the kale salad. The lettuce was brown on the edges and the $1.50 I paid for a sliver of avocado was ridiculous. I can't decide if I'll try you again or not.  I appreciate your nod to health, but meh...

First time visit on a Friday evening. The happy hour is affordable and delicious. Drinks are imaginative and flavorful. The patio is comfortable and cozy with a fireplace and heaters. We sampled our way through appetizers of Mediterranean style meatballs, veggie flatbread, and goat cheese baked with fresh tomatoes. All were spectacular. Dinner salad was crisp and fresh, and the polenta was creamy good. Hubby had the risotto which was a bit salty to my palate, but appropriately creamy. Our friends had the salmon which was moist and flavorful, and the black rice shrimp bowl which was tangy and tasty. The only bummer was the chocolate cake. The gelato it came with was superb, but the cake was so dry. Sorry. We will definitely be back. Maybe the sticky toffee pudding next time....

Who knew that such a lovely historic home was sitting right in the midst of our downtown? I've lived here 20 years and seen the house, but never ventured in for a tour. What was I waiting for?? This home is gorgeously refurbished to reflect its heyday. Great history lesson and some very fine furnishings and antiques throughout. A shout-out to Michael, our tour guide for an inspiring visit. And... tons of great eateries right around the corner. Loved it.

Not sure where I've been hiding out lately, but so glad I found Switch. My friends and I visited on a Saturday afternoon and sat outside on the patio. They do allow smoking, so be fore-warned about that. The only way we could tell our server was a newbie was that he had a pal shadowing him around and taking care that he was doing all he could to make our meal memorable. And it was! Our brunch - quiche of the day - was ridiculously delicious. I imagine they are all different, but this chicken, asparagus, chipotle, mushroom, spinach, and corn creation was amazingly flavorful. Mimosas were made from the freshest orange juice I have tasted in quite awhile. Two of us ordered the quiche and one of us ordered the breakfast special with beautifully poached eggs, crunchy baguettes, and a heaping pile of prosciutto. Great service, lovely ambience, good cocktails, and the food - wow, oh wow! Can't wait to visit again.

I've been here a few times and wasn't too amazed, but.... third time's the charm! The two-room concept with one side laid-back with college sports showing, and the other side spilling music and fun - perfect idea. We were here for a Goose Island Tap - Takeover and loved it. The beer was fab, the new beer manager was vibrant and it was all good. The food smelled heavenly too. I'll be back.

We have been here many times but this was the first time for Sunday football breakfast. We lucked out with the best bar staff ever - friendly and helpful when we couldn't decide. Great selection of beer on tap and the rotating selections are phenomenal. Bloody Mary was a bit on the spicy side - but most people loved it. Breakfast was good - the sweet potato tots were crispy crunchy delicious, bacon was well... bacon. Egg dishes were cooked to perfection. Aside from the rude Bears fan near us, it was a great morning at Boulders on Broadway. Love the bike rack too!

We arrived here on a Friday at high noon and the place was hoppin'! That's okay, service was quick and friendly and people were in and out leaving seats available for us to dine inside. It was a bit toasty outside. Our party enjoyed two of the specials of the day with buffalo chicken on dill bread and two orders of the turkey, avacado, etc. sammie on whole grain wheat. Both sandwiches were so fresh and delicious. Veggies on the sandwich were fresh and delicious, and the bread tastes homemade. Is it? I don't know. But... if you're hankering for a really good sandwich, Sacks is your spot. Only issue - tiny parking lot but Worth It!!!

I was not expecting much prior to my visit to the Well Bar. This "Oregon Duck" hang-out doesn't discriminate on Sunday mornings for NFL viewing. There are TV's tuned all around the front of the bar, a nice outside patio, very good prices on beer and cocktails, a terrific happy hour, some games around the bar, plus a pool table, and some truly incredible burgers and hot dogs on Sunday mornings. The guy works for tips, but deserves a hell of a lot more. Just like you cooked it on your own backyard grill, but someone else doing the work. A very fun Sunday morning - oh and you can bring in your own eats if you need to.

I never tire of a deliciously hot bowl of Pho from this place. This service is efficient and the food tastes so very fresh. The veggie pho is my favorite along with the soft appetizer spring rolls. My son usually gets the beef pho or one of the fried rice dishes and we have never been disappointed. Good lunch crowd every single day of the week. Yummy.

I would not have thought that a bar like this could be quite so good. Great service, lovely beer selection, Sunday morning football on the TV's, and an extremely decent breakfast. You can't beat the price for their food - really good. The service here was incredibly attentive and breaking up and keeping track of the checks for a party of 10 - you're on the money!!!

Always a great time at SanTan even when it's packed. Stopped in for a snack of pub pretzels and a frosty beer. We both had the Mr. Pineapple seasonal brew and it was quite tasty. I love that SanTan always has something different going on AND they are always working with someone in the community on a charitable mission. They sure know how to make downtown Chandler look good for all of us. Thanks SanTan!!

I have never stopped in here and was directed to try it out after visiting the Rosson House nearby. Super friendly vibe, clean throughout, and ice cold beer/cider on tap. Loads of bottle choices too. Theirs is a very nice British menu with some homestyle choices - shepherds pie, clam chowder, fish & chips, reuben sandwich, ploughmans lunch, and my favorite - bangers & mash. Buttery crisp onions smothered over tangy bangers and creamy mashed potatoes. Yum !!  The fresh asparagus wasn't too bad either. Sadly, they were out of brownies for dessert, but not to worry ... I'll be back!!

Wow - what a terrific experience. Laid-back Sunday afternoon and we couldn't have asked for a better lunch. Great service, very friendly and helpful. Delicious food - the sushi was fresh and flavorful, the miso soup was the best I've ever had. Comforting! Oh, and the sake bombs were spectacular. I will definitely return here again and again. Thanks for a beautiful lunch.

Let me start by saying that I was pretty hungry when I stopped into Genghis Grill. The concept is similar to other locations in the valley with smaller portions than others I have visited. The staff was super friendly and very helpful but please.... the buffet where you load your food was filthy! Not just spilled food, but dirty bowls to heap your food into and crusty little sauce bowls too. I can't believe the health department hasn't taken a peek at that. The food was fair but I just couldn't get past the mess. Sorry.

I was skeptical here but went in and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Jukebox, pool tables, darts, clean restrooms, and a lady with her dog. What more can you ask for in a local establishment? Beers are on the pricier side here (though I don't know why.) Maybe because it's in Scottsdale?? Whatever, dive bar worth visiting if you're out and about.

We've been here a couple of times but have never reviewed our visits. This mainstay near downtown Mesa smells like mesquite grilled heaven as you enter from the parking lot. The menu has a variety of memorable choices from the ancho-chile grilled salmon to the stacked enchiladas and lobster tamales. The tri-colored chips and salsa are terrific... don't miss the Yelp check in for a free cup of house made guacamole. The beer list is decent as well. Our service was good, not great but good. We'll definitely be back!

Craving a delicatessan style sandwich and not finding one in our area. So we popped into Firehouse Subs on a Saturday afternoon and they were hopping busy. Gave our order to the friendly clerk and waited (and waited and waited and waited) for our order. The sammies were quite good and definitely worth the wait. Soft bread roll and a tasty turkey sandwich. The dill pickle was crisp and cold. Would I stop in here again, you bet I would. But... I'm still craving that deli sandwich.

I do love La Bocca. It's a nice little place sitting on Mill Avenue where you can people watch if you sit outdoors. It's comfortable with heaters in our wintertime but a bit toasty in the summer. The staff is friendly and efficient and the food is good. Our party of 7 met for dinner before a play at Gammage on a Saturday evening. It was a bit crowded as the evening wore on and we were glad we had come early. The bruschetta is quite good and the Med plate was dynamite. We tried all eight of their bruschetta, and I love that fig!! Their salads are good and so are their pizzas. White wine sangria is also a great choice. Stop in and enjoy an afternoon or evening.

I dropped in here last week unexpectedly, just had a hankering for something Hawaiian after seeing the movie Aloha. It worked. The food is made to order and the menu is easy to figure out. Make your protein choice, your sauce choice, your rice choice... and voila - it's done. My tofu/veggie with brown rice and teriyaki sauce was cooked well and I found it to be quite tasty. The place was not too crowded just after lunch time so the wait time was minimal. I'd try this place again but it wouldn't replace my regular Hawaiian favorite in the area.

Oh North - you are absolutely delicious. The cocktails were amazing, the appetizers were fantastic (love those chips!) and our entrees were delectable. Dessert was truly a special occasion. Thanks for the great service and the friendly vibe. Oh, and your menu - aaahhh.... yum!!!

This gorgeous mall of shoppes in the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas are pricey for sure but it's lovely to look at all the upscale items. There are a few shops here and there that won't break your bank - look for Basin (a great little soap shop that has only one other location and that's in Orlando) and Fresh (great cosmetics) and other beauty stores. Lovely restaurants and super clean throughout.

It has been way too long Buca... And you were so damn delicious last night. Service was exceptional except for the bread that never came. No matter though. The bruschetta was freshly chopped tomatoes, garlic, and peppers on golden toasts. Love the presentation too. The fried appie plate was flavorful bits of calamari, mozzarella, and cheesy mushrooms. We shared the frutti del mar spiced delicately and filled with shrimp, mussels, and squid. The chicken pram was heavenly as was the baked ziti. No dessert tonight for us... Too full!!  I will be back Buca and it won't be a three year wait.

Holy Moley Duke's - What a crowd for the first Sunday of the NFL Season. I know you open at 9:30 and by 10:00 there was barely a seat in the place. Loved the way you set up the rooms with various games on the larger screens and that Bloody Mary Bar was perfect. This place was hopping and the service couldn't have been better. We had breakfast steak and eggs. The rib-eye was fantastic and the eggs were cooked as ordered. The potatoes were pretty sad though - sorry Duke's. They tasted like they had been sitting in a pot for quite some time. Drinks were cold and like I said, the set-up was really good. They even covered the pool tables to make extra seating for fans. I'd come back here for sporting events but I would get here MUCH MUCH earlier!!

I'm not sure how anyone can give this place less than a 5+. Service is top-notch and gracious as can be. They are busy here folks but you won't know it as you are seated and treated to their very best. Margaritas are pure and simple - try the 1/2 calorie Primarita Margarita or the smoky Smokehouse margarita. Both are clear winners. The tableside guacamole is chunky and spiced to your liking, and filled with flavor. You'll see that little silver cup and think it's not enough for your table, but it truly is. And the chips are divine as well. Our party of five enjoyed the tecate skirt tacos, scallop tacos, fresh halibut, butternut squash tacos, and pork shoulder. The steak tacos were the best we've ever had - our number one fave of the evening. Everything else was uber-tasty too. Dessert was a pumpkin bread pudding that was out of this world. I can't wait to go back!!!

Hanny's you are speaking my language! Love the vibe here - great service on a low-key Friday afternoon during the holidays. I imagine it gets pretty busy as the day wears on. Service is phenomenal and the cocktail menu scores very highly on my hit list. Our party enjoyed sturdy old-fashioned cocktails with loads of bourbon, a lemonade mixer (sweet and easy) and a couple of beers. The snacks are delightful, and the in-house desserts were excellent. Not a fan of key-lime pie but Hanny's, you've won me over with your version and your tiramisu is scrumptious. Flatbreads were very decent and the prosciutto sampler - divine. Be sure to check out the bathrooms upstairs in the old dressing rooms and the little room downstairs too. Love this place and I'll be back!!

We had dinner here and breakfast the next morning as well. The dinner was absolutely amazing - fresh unique ingredients and expert service. I cannot express how delicious that steak was - Thank you so much for a truly memorable meal. Breakfast the next morning at the buffet was also quite good. You cannot walk away from this place hungry, that's for sure. Breakfast or dinner - YUMMMY!

Friendly service, great food cooked to order. Absolutely loved the fried catfish, the hush puppies, and the fried okra. There's a fried theme here. But we also enjoyed the bbq brisket sandwich. There is a great vibe here, and we'd revisit in a hot second. Quick and delicious.

Seriously delicious food and extremely impeccable service. Our trio enjoyed a terrific view of the Westin Kierland Golf Course and the desert beyond on a flawless winter day. Our server could not have been more gracious. The coffee is remarkable and we were warmed up to start. One of us had the burger which was an enormous beef patty cooked to perfection on a huge toasted bun with all the extras. Yum. Another friend had the tacos and they were also amazing - not too spicy, but flavorful. I had the chopped salad with salmon. That salmon was perfectly cooked and made the salad. The sweet potato fries, while a bit soft, were delicious. And that little bit of desert bread pudding put us all over the top. I'd come back for certain, and next time I'm staying the night...

There was no line and no wait here on a Saturday evening. After dining here, I know why. The wait staff was not too friendly. We were seated quickly but received our first trickle of ice water about 10 minutes later. Our cucumber salad with garlic had enough garlic to season a month's worth of salad. Yikes! Hand-stretched noodles seemed a good choice for the Shanghai Pork/Veggie Mein but it was soo salty with an almost burnt bean taste. We also ordered the vegetable spring rolls and they were fried on the outside but mealy and un-done on the inside. Ick.  If it were up to me, I'd tell you to skip it and find something better.

First time ever for Filipino food and we were not disappointed. Quick counter service or you can order from the grill. Hubby had the spam & eggs with garlic rice. The spam was crisp-fried, the eggs were perfectly over-easy, and the garlic rice was tender and flavorful. I had the coconut chicken (brothy/creamy) over white rice. It was a little bit sweet and a little bit savory. Some of the chicken pieces were still on the bone, so even though they are bite-sized, be careful. Clean, super clean bathrooms, and friendly service. Good prices too. We'll be back for sure.

Wow - what a treat. Delicious breakfast in a small-town setting. The Albanian sausage and egg breakfast and skillet breakfast were both very good. The service here is very attentive and friendly. I'd come back here for breakfast any day of the week.

Please hurry up and go get some sweet sweet cupcakes from this great place. I don't want to lose them!! I can't believe that we finally have a delightful little bakery in our own backyard making delicious and original cupcakes. The size of the cupcake is perfect, the cake is moist, the frosting is creamy and decorative. I love that there are so many different flavors and colors. This place is clean and the staff is most helpful and very friendly. I think the price of $3 is just right compared to other cupcake places around the valley. Yippee!!

A great big thank you to our waiter, Keenan; who made the morning super enjoyable with his wit, charm and efficiency. This Lolo's is a bit classier than the original, though the food is still just as down-home delish! I do prefer the original restaurant's vibe, but this locale worked well for our trio today. The chicken was tender, crunchy, and savory and the waffles were golden brown sweet heaven. The grits were fluffy and oh so buttery, while the candied sweets stole the show. Staff and service are friendly, young, and efficient. Great meal, thank you LoLo's. Don't worry... we'll be back. :)

Always a great place to stop in with a really cool ambiance. Hula's made room for our larger party outside on the patio, and they weren't kidding when they said the heaters would warm us up. Thanks! The drinks are really nice here and the food is good. Not my very favorite food, mind you, but good. Everybody loves the spiciness of their dishes. We'll be back for sure.

Really nice vibe in here and the beer was delicious. Super hot outside and an ice-cold beer absolutely did the trick. The service was superb and the overhead movie was pretty funny. I will return here again I am sure. Just wish you had a few more snacks. Or maybe I'll bring in my own?? Hope that's okay because I wouldn't want to miss out on your beer.

In a word - awful. The place was packed, must be because it's so affordable. You get what you pay for here. The beer selection is inadequate for a bar and the really special "special" on Saturday night - prime rib... may have been the worst piece of meat I've ever had. That's what I get for ordering steak in a bar. Yuck. At least our server was friendly.

We really enjoyed our lunch here at Sprecher's. The beer flight was Huge! but the choices were ice cold and flavorful. I had a wonderful burger (medium, touch of pink within) on a soft delicious brioche bun. My daughter had the beer cheese soup and both were dynamite. I would skip on the sweet potato fries next time - soggy and bland. But the burger was so good, I didn't care. There's outdoor seating in good weather and TV's in the bar area. Their homemade root beer and sorbet made the most delicious float I've ever ever had. Don't miss it!

Great bar service here at Hussong's Cantina. Our bartender was friendly and explained the tequila menu, even bringing out the extra stuff. I love a margarita that isn't made with a pre-made mix and Hussong's brought it out just the way I love it. It felt like a true Mexican margarita. The chips and salsa were quite good, but the guacamole was over the top with onions. If you love onions - go for it. If you don't... skip it. The guy next to us didn't speak English and the bartender found a translator for him. Great service - I wouldn't hesitate to return.

Rigatony's I have probably reviewed you before but must do it again. I love your food, I love your service, I love your shot of chianti at the start of the meal, I love your salads and pastas. Mostly, I love how close you are to home and your food that feels like home. I can honestly say that you're my favorite Italian restaurant for these simple reasons. Keep doing what you do and I'll keep coming back.

This was my third visit to The Duce and just about as enjoyable as the previous two. I love the vibe here - great cocktails, good music, and comfort food. Next time I'm going for the beer-can chicken and forcing myself to wait the 25 minutes. It looks amazing! We had the sliders, roasted corn, and special of the day - Sonoran Hot Dog. All were delicious. Their cocktails are amazing though and I cannot get that fresh margarita (no mixer) out of my head. Going back for another sometime soon for sure. The only down side to this visit was the music from the wedding in the back half of the building. I love how they divided the place off for the wedding, and the sheer panels looked beautiful blowing in the breeze. But the music... Two sides of The Duce playing competing tunes was confusing. If there's a wedding and they have great music and a DJ - let it flow outward. Otherwise... it's just too much.

There is nothing overly special here. The noodles are cooked well, but the broth choices are not unique. Our selections were either overly salted or under seasoned. If you have any allergy concerns, be prepared to figure it out yourself. We won't be back.

Such a gorgeous space overlooking the golf course at the Phoenician. We were lucky enough to be seated on the patio as the sun went down and it was just breezy and spectacular viewing. I love how the desert looks at sunset. We all had a burger - four different burgers to be exact and they were all absolutely positively some of the best burgers ever. Great flavor, cooked to perfection, and the tator tots on the side were just about unbeatable. Love the presentation! Service here was good but a bit harried. Maybe she was just busy, I don't know. My water was never re-filled and that always bugs me that I have to ask. But the food and the ambiance was terrific and I'll come back for more again and again.

Oh My Land - the Sunday brunch here is amazing. We sat at the bar, because they are quite busy. Loved the service and attention here. We both had their banger breakfast with eggs. Zesty sausages with a nice scrub of toast and eggs. The Magic Coffee is absolutely fantastic - spicy, creamy, rich coffee. Yum. Their cocktails are quite good, and again - the service was dynamite.

I love donuts. I seriously love donuts and Bosa makes some of the best donuts around. We usually stop in late-night and ask for whatever is warm and fresh. The owner is usually baking after 11pm. I love their old-fashioned style donuts with chocolate frosting, maple frosting, or crumb topping. Hubby loves the fritters. I'm not too much of a fan of the cream filled style, but do enjoy the jelly filled. If you go at in-between hours or middle of the day, your donut may feel a little stale, but still very tasty. Late-night ... use the drive-thru. They're open 24 hours a day for your donut dining pleasure. Yum.

Sweet little place in Phoenix - very cozy. Counter service is very friendly and our hot cocoas were just about the best around. I had a simple lemon & powdered sugar crepe. It was cooked with a delicate hand and almost a tiny bit eggy in flavor. Smashing. Hubby had one with bacon, turkey, sweet cherries, and cheese - oh my goodness  - what an amazing combination. Sweet and savory and absolutely rich with flavor. I wouldn't hesitate to stop in again for the relaxed vibe, friendly service, and good eats.

What a gem! We had reservations for 6pm on a Saturday night and from the moment we entered till the moment we left, our experience was amazing. The place is homey and cozy with the delicious scent of good food all around. Think good old-fashioned American specialities with a savory twist. We were shown to our table and waited on with such attention that we almost couldn't believe it. Our water glasses never went empty, and we never sat for more than a few minutes without someone paying attention to us. The specialty cocktails were innovative, and the beer/wine list was very nice. And the food.... oh wow! We sampled the bread basket of cheddar biscuits, a chopped salad with all kinds of fresh veggies and a basil/champaigne vinaigrette, the 4-cheese grilled cheese & red pepper tomato soup appetizer, the savory cheddar bacon stuffing, and the extremely flavorful green chile pork stew. Don't let me stop there - the desserts were absolutely amazing. We shared the pecan fig pie, the coconut cake, and the chocolate bacon s'mores. Their homemade ice cream is so rich and creamy, it's sinful. This place is good for young people, first dates, families, celebrations, and anything in-between. Come as you are and enjoy!

Wow Flanny's - you have upped your game considerably. I know you're listening and reading these reviews because the food was perfect, and your bartenders/servers were on their game. Thank you for restoring my belief that a neighborhood bar could be all that I hope for. I can now heartily recommend you to all my friends. If you're reading this try the rotating tap selection of great beer and the grilled chicken wings. Dynamite combo.

We arrived separately after taking incorrect turns in downtown Chandler, ordered on three different checks, complained about how customer service in this country is lacking on so many levels and then we had breakfast at Yoli's! Get thee-self over here straight-away. They have been serving up delicious breakfasts for 18 months now and this is the first I've heard of them. I need to get out more often. Pancakes, waffles, eggs, breakfast sammies, omelettes, skillets, biscuits ... need I go on? Friendly and personable service with smiles and helpful can-do attitudes.Good food served to order hot and yummy. Inside seating, garden seating, your choice, your way. I love a place that goes above and beyond to make my day a special one. Thank you Yoli's for reminding me that there is goodness and deliciousness all rolled into one place right here in Chandler, Arizona.

Yum-diddly-yum! This hopping little place inside The Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas is delicious. The wait was not terrible (15 minutes) and the staff was attentive and friendly. We started with the fried pickle appetizer  - good breaded crunchy coating and equally crunchy dill pickle spears within. A few fried olives in the mix didn't hurt one bit. Hubby ordered the Korean Bull-Gogi burger loaded with a nice soy/kalbi marinade, kimchi, and a fried egg atop a perfectly cooked burger and incredibly toasty bun. This burger was a nice size and had a good side of sweet potato fries with it. I had the lobster roll sliders in mini-hot dog buns with a nice aioli and cup of cole slaw. Great flavor on both entrees. Plus... we each had one of their cool milk-shakes. Mine was the Oreo cookie with Bailey's and hubby had the S'mores with rum. Goodness gracious, set me up with another! Food was pretty reasonably priced for pricey Vegas as well. Try it!

What a delight! Lovely outdoor patio and space with a winning combination of friendly service and honestly good food. Our veggie inclination was favored nicely here and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The crispy brussell sprouts chips were our favorite, but we also loved the cheeseboard that favored goat (my fave) and the pear-gorgonzola flatbread. The squash enchiladas were a huge treat as well. The cocktails were also superb - so get out there and try this place!!

I'm not sure what I can say about this place that hasn't been said already. The service is beyond compare, the place is clean and fresh feeling. The drinks are unique and quite tasty. I was really happy with my selections, and the food is out of this world. Delicious chopped salad (with a facebook page all its own) and yummy scallops, short ribs, and meatloaf too. Who'd a thunk meatloaf could be so tasty??? Desert was a tad underwhelming and I do love a good dessert, so maybe next time. Great place for a romantic dinner too. Yum.

Loved the vibe here on a Thursday evening - not too terribly crowded, but there were no downtown events scheduled. It was restaurant week however, and we dined from both menus. Hubby had the fried chicken with honey biscuit and the chicken was cooked to perfection with a crunchy flavorful exterior. The biscuit was flaky (huge) and melt-in-your mouth perfect. I chose from the RW menu and had the hummus (a bit spicy), the green chile stew (perfectly seasoned with huge chunks of short rib) and the salted caramel pudding (creamy, delicate, full of caramel flavor - and probably the best dessert I've ever had... hands down.) I would hit them up again and enjoy ordering just about anything from their hit list. Service was good, there was a tiny snafu with our order but our wait staff fixed it up in no time at all. Good for a small group of friends, date night, or stop by on your own - good beers on tap too.

This was a terrific find for breakfast last Sunday. My book club friends enjoyed the ambience and the friendly service. We were quite comfortable in a larger booth with the open air bar area allowing a nice breeze and a good vibe too. Food was extraordinarily tasty. Crab Cake Eggs Benedict (with Hollandaise on the side), Open Faced Breakfast Sandwich, and more. The breakfast beverages are good as well. Try the pumpkin-spice latte, the Caramel Hot-chocolate, or one of their other speciality drinks. The patio is dog-friendly which is a plus for dog-owners like me and their happy hour menu looks amazing.

Second time to BLD and so disappointed. The short rib breakfast burrito was dry and tasteless, and the avacodo was missing in action! My friend's chicken fried steak was greasy and gloppy and tough. She could barely cut her steak and the potatoes were cold.  Service was indifferent as in our waiter couldn't have cared less about us. He was absent for much of the time we were there. Hey... how about some water?? What a difference from the last time we were here. Can't rave today.

Third time is not the charm. Sorry guys but your waitress was rude and sarcastic (and not in a good way either.) I'd love to come into this restaurant and have a friendly vibe but it just isn't happening. Water is not filtered and you can taste it. Hot chocolate was neither sweet nor chocolately. And hey, is it really so hard to put the hollandaise on the side? That's what I asked for but that's not how my benedict came to me. Set in front of me with no apology like I just have to eat it this way or nothing. And that avocado mush - what is that? No flavor added to the bennie at all. Whatever - There won't be any more chances here. Really sorry - I tried to like you.

BLD - I'm back for more of the same. I've raised you one star but that's all you're gonna get from me. Yes, your food is pretty good during the breakfast hour. It's hard to mess up oatmeal for sure. But you did mess up an omelette, an order of potatoes, and surprisingly an eggs benedict at our table for four. Your wait staff was smiling for sure, but jeez - so absurdly out of it this morning. I was shorted $1.27 in change on my bill, and her lack of interest in our table was surprisingly bold. You're crowded and I just don't get it. Two stars for the food, but it'd be a 1 for service. Sorry.

Too crowded down the street and late for a Gammage production, we stopped in for a bite and were SO pleasantly surprised. The service is attentive and friendly and the place is super clean. Pizzas here are both unusual and mainstream. You can go either way and be happy as can be. The crust on that barbecue chicken pizza was undeniably tasty. Sauce that's not too sweet or salty and cooked perfectly. I can't imagine trying anywhere else when I have a pizza craving. Need to work on that spinach salad though - all spinach and the extras were hard to find. I'll be back though, and I can't wait.

Celebrating a birthday here and found Windsor to be just the ticket. Service was exemplary, the throw-back cocktails were astounding. Especially loved the #04 - try it, you'll love it. Actually everything we tried was delish. Cocktails, starters, dinners, and ice cream dessert. We shared the mini corn-dogs (yum) and the roulette of roasted peppers (surprisingly yum) pre-dinner. Everybody ordered something different and all was quite good - pork sandwich, tuna tartare, ahi tuna salad, white fish sandwich, and the short ribs - I would have any one of them again. As said before, service was excellent and the place has great music playing with a hip wall to check out as you enter the restroom area. Be forewarned though - the parking lot is TINY.

This review is for a private luncheon. Service was friendly and efficient. The food was perfect in every way. From the cheese plates to the sangrias to the perfectly timed lunch plates it was a special meal. The grilled veggie salad was loaded with zucchinii, squash, and corn over fresh crisp salad. The grilled ham Sammie was toasted perfectly with cheese oozing out the sides. The salmon was perfection itself and the hit of lunch. The piece d'resistance was the baby cake... Yum. We chose strawberries and cream and reveled in the luscious flavors and light creamy texture. I wouldn't hesitate to book a special lunch here. It was divine.

Based on prior visits, I scheduled a little lunch here for some friends. We had a reservation and were seated promptly at 11:30am. Before I go further, it was NOT crowded at all. At 11:50 we finally received water and our drink order was given (but never received.) At 11:55 we asked to see a menu for lunch which started at noon. We were told we could either have breakfast or lunch but no combination - that's acceptable, but we wish we'd known that when we were seated. At 12:00 noon our server finally appeared to take our orders and we chose breakfast. I realize everyone has a bad day, but our server was not friendly, helpful, interested in us, or timely. Our food was delivered about 12:15pm. The french toast and the crepes were both quite good (hence the 2-star review) but the breakfast potatoes seemed straight from the can with a red coating and the bread pudding was soggy. No mention of baby cakes or dessert or coffee/tea or the original drink order placed. Service was so sluggish and unfriendly my guests could not believe I had suggested this place. Of course a poor review will not harm your stellar reputation, but I do hope that you'll pay closer attention to the smaller tables visiting your establishment on a Saturday morning.

Loved seeing Anthony Jeselnick here - so hilarious!! Thanks for bringing him to town. I have to say that this venue is very clean, but very very tight. I know they have to bring in as many guests as possible, but it's cramped. Wait staff is efficient and there's a 2-drink minimum (which is customary around town.) The beer and wine were all fine, but the soft drinks and lemonade were watered down awful. Certainly everyone is not here for lemonade, but still. Food smelled good too. I'd come back for someone to make me laugh again.

We stopped in for a bit of imbibing and light dinner before heading to the comedy club next door. Great service, 60 beers on tap, and a good menu. All I could smell coming in to this place were the nachos and they did not disappoint. Loved the veggie ciabatta sandwich and the house chips as well. Our friend had one of the burgers and he said it was terrific. Loved the vibe here, lots of seating choices and standing too if you're so inclined. I could see that this place might be busy busy on a weekend, but it was pretty fair for a Thursday evening. Might be one of my new favorites downtown and I'm planning to head back one night for live karaoke. Fun.

I've been here twice now and this place is as cute and fresh as it can be. First visit I had the eggs benedict with potatoes. The eggs benny were delicious, the orange juice was fresh and cold, but the potatoes were average. Second visit I had the pear omelette and a little bran muffin. That may not sound good to some, but this was absolutely delicious. Great taste and presentation. The service is very friendly here and though it's crowded, it's super-clean. I wouldn't hesitate to visit again. Might skip the potatoes though.

Thanks to Katie - a dynamite teacher with great taste in music and an avidly talented artist. She kept our group focused and fun all the while. Folks - the first drink is on the house, and their beer and wine selection is quite good. I loved spending an afternoon here and creating a masterpiece that I never thought I could create. Thanks Katie and pals... I had a blast.

I've been here a few times and am never really that impressed. The place is always crowded and loads of diners waiting to grab a seat but I don't understand ... it must be me. Tried the protein pancake and it wasn't cooked all the way through - the middle was still wet. Ick. Flavor of the pancake was decent but nothing to rave about. One friend tried the egg breakfast - good but hash browns were undercooked and another the protein waffle - very good. Service is very good here and the place is clean. But are they hurrying with the food to seat the diners waiting? I don't know but I probably won't be back to find out.

Seating was good; it was a busy Sunday afternoon and lots of soccer fans were watching the U.S. game. Our server was friendly and helpful and the beer was ice cold. Lots of choices on tap and we found a few that suited us perfectly. Nice ambience - thanks a bunch!!

O.H.S.O. doesn't stand for anything in particular but who cares? This place has a nice feel, friendly service, and a terrific brunch. The food was uber-tasty, but what really wowed us was the $10 price for a brunch item plus a 10 ounce beer. Where else can you be fed like that? Good menu choices like breakfast burritos, green pork chile, and a fantastic french toast with toppings. Love the open garage door windows and the cool mist on the toasty Arizona patio.

Thanks so much Lucky Break for the terrific Thursday night fun. Our party of eight thoroughly enjoyed visiting. Pool, shuffleboard, spin the wheel, ice-cold beer, throwback cocktails, terrific appies (especially the garlic fries) and unbelievably friendly service made this visit a treat. You have become my new favorite neighborhood bar. Can't wait for Sunday morning football breakfasts too!!

This was our second dining experience at Distrito and I have to say that last time was a bit better. The service is incredibly attentive and the ambience is lovely. Our server, Matteo, was efficient and gracious - thanks for making a prediction with us for 2014! The food is truly delicious - we started with chips and guacamole (yum) and ventured into the small plate realm with ahi tuna (meh), fish tacos (dynamite), carnitas tacos (very good), lamb tacos (good), corn chowder (to die for) and the octopus (didn't try it!) The margaritas here are superb as well, or try the tequila flight that'll knock your socks off. Our shared desserts were the chocolate espresso cake and the citrus crème. I think the citrus dessert was a bit better and I adore chocolate. We'll be back for sure - hope you'll try it too.

Super cute little spot tucked away and almost hidden unless you know where you are looking. Thursday evening not too crowded and we loved hanging out in the back room with the skee-ball. The highly polished and absolutely gorgeous tall tables had us wondering where we could get a couple for our own house. But the cocktails were fantastic and the beer specials good. Service was quite good as well. I can't wait to stop in here again.

Searched for something new on Yelp and my friends - you did not let me down. This amazing little space has friendly helpful service, and a plethora of delectable choices for breakfast. We tried a trio of the scrambles - smoked salmon... whiskey sausage... and prosciutto with all the mixins. Momma had a beautiful pancake that had a large hint of cinnamon and ginger.  Easy location to venture out onto 5th Avenue and help to stimulate our economy. OH, and the scone was a wonderful snack a bit later on. I will definitely visit you again Dottie's!!!

I love BBQ and Rudy's - you have my number. Every single time I visit, the place is studded with men on their lunch breaks. I'm not complaining here, but this girl loves your food too! My favorite is your moist brisket done perfectly with crispy little ends. That and your ribs, smoked turkey, and chicken and I'm in heaven. Don't let me forget to mention that creamy corn you serve up with the meats. That is tummy-tickling goodness. The set-up here is super easy to navigate as you meander back and forth through the line past the bottled beverages - good beers and sodas to choose from. Step up to the counter and order your meats and sides and they hand it all to you in a wooden crate. You and your party may now sit wherever you darn well please - my son and I love to sit on the patio. Best BBQ in the Chandler/Tempe area so far!

I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time and Hubs brought me here for my birthday today. Lovely outdoor setting with lots of 4-top tables and picnic tables for larger parties too. There are oversized Jenga sets, a ping-pong table, and a set-up for bean bag toss on this pet-friendly patio. Misters were on lightly and felt wonderful as we start summer here in Phoenix. Service was good and the beer was icy cold. Thanks for making our German favorites - rattlers with fresh lemonade. Menu selections were ample and we took our server's recommendation. The spicy brat was terrific, the lamb brat was excellent, and the veal brat was dry and chewy. Sadness for me as that was my order. The other brats were juicy and delicious but the veal was just blah. French fries were done up crispy good and the German potato salad is an interesting (but tasty) variation on the classic style. The date cake for dessert was a lovely treat. I'd come back but wouldn't get the veal.

I hate to do this but I must. We stopped into Brat Haus yesterday on a gorgeous sunny afternoon. Our party of 12 arrived in two sets of 6 diners. We opted for outdoor seating after being greeted in the most reticent of ways. Before I go further, it was NOT crowded! Our server was the most inattentive, unfriendly, and downright surly waitress I have ever encountered. Her defiant disgust was evident from start to finish. We waited 20 minutes for water, another 15 - 20 for our drink orders to be taken. We did split checks, and I know this is not easy for servers or welcome actually, but the rude dismissal is so unnecessary. I can't imagine we're the first group to ask to split the check here. I also understand that 18% was placed immediately on our tabs for service, and she never would have received that tip from me. However, good service would have earned so much more for the effort. Maybe a smile once?? Waters were never refilled, the food was merely passable today, and not one among us thought our service was anything but bad. Two stars today for the beer selection, and nothing else. I know this review won't detract from your popularity, but hey... In the absence of good service, I won't be back to spend my money here when there are so many other choices around town. Oh, and the single ladies' bathroom out back was dirty too. Sorry.

Can't wait to get back for a dessert item I spied on the menu - some kind of delectable brownie concoction, but I digress. The place has the coolest beach vibe with groovy art, tv, and music making it work. Very friendly service, and the menu is ridiculously impressive. Their burgers cannot be beat and your choices/combinations are limitless. I had a pineapple bbq backyard burger with giant crunchy onion rings atop. I couldn't get the thing to smash below a 4" gap and had to make do with knife and fork. Hubby had the bacon/egg burger combo (can't remember the names of these bad boys) but they were both cooked to perfection, juicy, and the bun... oh my land. Don't miss out on the sweet potato tots - full of flavor and crispy good. Next time, I may share a burger so I can land that dessert. Will be SOON.

Two visits here and you haven't let me down. Small and busy on weekend mornings but so friendly and your servers are incredible. Thanks for the tidbits while we were waiting last week. Really tasty stuff! The crepes are divine. I love to share one savory and one sweet crepe with my hubby - quite a nice treat. The lemon sugar is amazing. Best crepes around, period!

Stopped in for a mid-morning breakfast and was absolutely delighted with my choice. I enjoyed the Johnnycakes (corn & chiles) with sweet rice and fried potatoes. The Johnnycakes were tender, crispy, and oh-so flavorful. The prickly pear maple syrup was smashing drenching the salty cakes. The sweet rice was like a breakfast rice & raisins dish and meshed perfectly with the savory cakes. The potatoes were crispy on the outside, cooked through within and flavored with crispy little onion slivers. The weather has become perfect for enjoying a meal outdoors - go for it!!

World of Beer - You've upped your game quite a bit since my last visit. Your service has improved and your taps are filled with a ton of great choices. Thanks for keeping the place cleaner than I remembered and taking any negative press to heart. I'll definitely be back for more of the same!!

Great late night spot - our last stop on a pub crawl in downtown Phoenix. Loads of terrific choices on tap and good service. We didn't have anything to eat from the menu, but would definitely visit again and try something. Clean, with a pretty hip vibe.

"Disappointed" is the word for this review. This trendy little place in a strip mall studded with alternate choices was our choice for dinner. Loud, really loud inside. Inattentive service ... water glasses left unfilled, no second drink order, no mention of dessert, just lackluster all around. And the food. Meh. Soggy pizza, flavorless oysters, over salted mushroom sauce on the gnocchi, and burnt artichokes. I could almost go one star, but the bathroom was clean, and the hostess was friendly. Skip it.

Hey, seriously folks? I have wanted to try this trendy little establishment for awhile now. I love the layout and the open air feeling and the hanging bike for sure. So last Sunday afternoon we stopped in and grabbed an outside table and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. My son even stepped up to the bar for service and the bartender told him he'd be back in a minute but that turned into five more. So we stood up to leave and our server appeared. She popped a few menus down and strode off, not to be seen for about 10 more minutes. I'm just getting started here! We ordered a beer or two, which they didn't have. We went down their list of beers and they were out of six - 6!! beers that we wanted to try. You're kidding, right? Nope. So we ultimately ordered something she said they had and she came back a few minutes later with another beer entirely. Yep, they were out of another beer. We ordered food, why oh why? Got our dried out pressed patties of beef (?) with literally no dressing whatsoever. The Classic Burger should have had a bacon bleu cheese dressing - it was absent just like the beer in this place. Score Card - Service, blech. Beer selection, blech. Food, blech. Handlebar - you had your chance and I'm never coming back. Sorry.

This little place is a hidden gem. Don't pass it up - terrific food, friendly people, and did I mention terrific food? We had ribs and fried chicken and several side dishes. The ribs were tender and meaty with a delectable bbq sauce. The chicken was lightly battered, peppery, hot and delicious. Sides - collard greens to beat all, fried cabbage, sweet potatoes that were sweeeeet and green beans that were good too. The cornbread was a bit sweet, but dry. It could use a little butter and honey I think. But hey Ezekiel's I will be back again and again and again. Yum.

Might be one of my new favorite breweries. The service on a laid-back NFL Sunday was quite pleasant. A couple of the taps were out and that is always disappointing but the flavorful variety of beers did not disappoint us in the least. There are a lot of choices here in Phoenix, but this one hit the spot. We tried every beer on the menu between our group of 6 and there was something for everyone. No food on the menu here, but you can bring in your own. Good popcorn!

This place was an incredible surprise! Happy Hour on a Thursday evening and some great specials. Good drink prices, good beer selection, nice cocktails. The Happy Hour food menu was priced very well and all was quite tasty. We shared the flatbread, calamari, bruschetta and a few chopped salads and couldn't have been happier with our choices. I will say that the wait time for our food exceeded our patience by a few minutes. At 45 minutes wait time for appies, that's quite a wait. We'll try this place again though for the prices and delicious food. A five star review if service had been snappier.

Delicious does not even begin to describe the delights that await you at Pig & Pickle. Great service, hip vibe, and YUM food. Pig delivers the Pig!! We enjoyed the charcuterie, the bone marrow, the pork tacos, the duck-fat fries, and the lovely libations. To say that we'll be back is an understatement. We'll be back about a hundred times every time we're cravin' bacon!!

We ordered over the phone for pick-up which was a great idea. Not much seating inside so take-away is the way to go! Food was delish. Spam musubi was fresh, lightly salted, and very flavorful. The chicken katsu was fried to a crispy-crunchy exterior with tender juicy white meat chicken within. The kalbi short ribs were flavorful (albeit a bit fatty) but super tasty. Steamed rice was good, mac salad was decent, and the cabbage was great! Can't wait to visit again.

Oh my gosh, what a great hang-out spot in central Phoenix. We were there on a Thursday evening and the ambience is yuppie cool. Lovely lights strung throughout a place that feels like someone's huge backyard. Good food provided by three local establishments that we adore. The service was excellent and friendly. Loved playing Ping-Pong and bean bag toss. We'll be back to hang out for some more of your extraordinary tasting cocktails and good food.

I have been anxious to try this place with it's great reviews. Last month I joined the Garden with my mom and today we finally made it to Gertrude's. Delish! Attentive and friendly service with some excellent recommendations. It's chilly outside today so we started with their hot tea - peppermint variety and perfect for the day. My mom enjoyed the BLT with fried green tomatoes, crispy bacon, fresh leafy lettuce, and a delectable remoulade sauce. I may have spelled that incorrectly! French fries were crispy and hot. I had the warm cauliflower salad with roasted cauliflower and acorn squash, fried kale, and a toasted oil vinaigrette. It was warm and comforting and absolutely delicious. Thanks for a great meal!

I promised I'd give them a Yelp review and here it is. Service was absolutely a 10+ on friendliness. The place was clean as could be and so cozy. Coffee shakes were good, but the hot fudge chocolate mint sundae in a cone cannot be beat. Thanks so very much!! The ice cream here is obviously a Chicago-area treat and we Phoenicians are so lucky to have Petersen's amongst us. The ice cream was rich and creamy, heavy on the butterfat and so flavorful. Lots of ice cream to choose from in this life, but Petersen's is my new fave. Run on down to this lovely little spot and grab a scoop, a cup, a cone, a coffee shake or some fresh brewed tea. LOVELY!!! Thanks guys!

I am not a Gordon Ramsay fan at all, but stopped in here because we were so hungry. It was fantastic! The pea soup was creamy and flavored just right. No dairy, by the way either - just the way I need it to be. Toast/bread was crispy and fresh and so good in the soup. We also shared the olives - amazing! And the salmon spread was to die for. Beers were cold and refreshing and service was very very good. We waited a bit between visited from our waiter, but that was okay. Very good.

Why haven't I stopped in here before?? I do not know but won't let too much time slip by before I stop in again. Friendliest service ever and a great wine list. Four beers on tap and the rest are in bottles, served up in a cold glass. Nice. The warm olives were dynamite - really truly good. And so was the bruschetta, especially the squash blossom. YUM with a capital YUM. We also shared the charcuterie plate and it was nice - great bread too. The bourbon chocolate pecan pie was the tastiest pecan pie I've ever had and I love pecan pie. The salted ice cream was delish as well. Quite a treat here at Nosh!!

Love the ambience, love the kid-friendly service, and love the menu. Very good service, good pancakes, good French-toast, but something weird is going on with the bananas. Were they coated in something or frozen/de-thawed? Or just off? I'm not sure but it was different. I'd get that delicious French toast again because the rest was so darn good. I'll be back, truly I will.

I've now been to three Chop Shop locations in the valley and the food is dynamite at each and every stop. Love the chopped vegetable salad, the fresh smoothies, the sweet potato hash, and the delectable baked goods. The flavors here are clean, fresh, unpretentious, and not overly seasoned or sweetened. I love how refreshing it all is. Gotta say my favorite location is the one in Chandler though - love the ambiance there!!

I cannot wait to get back here and try a few more tasty nuggets from their inventive and delectable menu! Great service, loved the indoor-outdoor ambiance, and the guitar player on the patio was amazing. Our server hinted that our party of four might want to graze our way through the menu and she was right. We sampled the Fried Green Tomatoes & Guacamole (super spicy); the Duck-fat Fries (amazingly crispy and flavorful); the crispy Brussels Sprouts (OMG yum!); the Green Chile Pork Stew (super flavorful and not too spicy); the roasted organic beets (tender and fresh); the white corn cheese grits (with a 110 minute egg on top... just do it!); and the fresh fish (to die for.) Are you hungry yet?? You should be and don't dilly dally about getting over there for a wonderful evening. Their cocktails are refreshing too - loved the sweet maple bourbon and the blood orange margarita. No room for dessert, but next time I'll try harder - loved it.

As awesome as a brewing company can be. Great beer - I mean it. There wasn't one brew we didn't love. The service - terrific and attentive. Thanks so much!! And the food - the mussels were amazing, the pretzel bread was the best ever. This location has a lot going for it. It's one of those place I don't want people to know about because it'll get too crowded, but I want everyone to know about it because it is so damn good.

Apparently Barrelhouse has found a new answer for their service issues that other Yelpers have identified. It's simple - they turn you away at the door. We arrived at 7:45pm, well-dressed, and sober without a reservation. We were told there was no available seating for the entire evening. It was interesting to be staring at three empty tables and an open bar, to be told they had no room. Could we sit at the bar? Nope. No room. I was not aware that the "French Laundry" had made its way to Chandler. Jeez.

I'd give this place 5 stars based on the food, but the service was so iffy I had to bump to 4 stars. The house that is Bink's Midtown is darling - terrific wood floors, lovely little bar at the entrance, a cute patio out front, and conversational tables situated throughout. We were greeted very nicely at check-in and ready to enjoy their spectacular happy hour specials. Beer, wine, cocktails all - 1/2 off! Along with some specialty delights. We shared the golden beets (yum) and the sweet potato (yum) to start. The wine selection was decent and there are a couple of beer choices on tap. We moved through to the deep fried ribs and sweetbreads (both good) and on to the amazingly delicious butternut squash soup and shrimp roll. The cardamom donut holes were also superb. We ate like kings from the smaller menu and can't wait to go back and try the dinner menu with trout, duck, and the like. As a side bar on the service - it was mostly efficient and barely friendly - a smile and some care or concern for our time in your restaurant would have gone a long way and given you a better tip too.

Sunday Morning Football Breakfast Folks!!! Stop on in and grab yourself some happy hour beers and a good breakfast. Loved the pancakes and omelettes. Our server couldn't get it all quite right every time, but we were patient. After my son's breakfast was dropped on the floor, and they forgot his sausage we had hoped for some comp on our bill and were not disappointed. Great vibe - good tv screen positions around the bar and very friendly.

Thanks so much for a lovely experience. So nice to sit outside under the misters on a warm afternoon. Hummus nachos went well with the delicious and unusual cocktails. The lavender gin fizz was terrific. Our salads were so freshly prepared with spinach, avocado, and a lovely bit of salmon. Great ambience outdoors, and a nice wine list to boot.

Your juices and bombas are divine and the service is superb. The torta was a bit spicy for my taste, but I bet there are people out there who absolutely love the heat. I'll go for something a bit milder next time. I had no idea this little gem was hidden down here in Tempe. Must repeat visit.

This tribute to Michael Jackson was so well done - music, dancing, choreography were all exceptional. We had seats in house left and I would go center section next time a bit farther back. There is so much to see that you cannot possibly take it all in - so choose your seats carefully. I have seen other Cirque shows and believe that the acrobatic portion has been a bit better elsewhere. But you can't beat the surprises, the dancing, and the music here at Mandalay Bay with Michael Jackson.

Just as wonderful as your Denver location, but bigger. A good 20 minute wait early on a Saturday morning, which I thought was appropriate. Great hash browns, and that trio of pancakes cannot be beat. I tried the blueberry, the tropicalada, and the sweet potato pancakes. Unbelievable! And when your server says you can have breakfast any old way you want it, they mean it. Décor is kitschy and cute, the place is spanking clean too. Don't dilly-dally about, run and grab yourself some breakfast at Snooze.

Oh My Land.... the tacos here are phenomenal. Loved the shrimp taco, the fish taco, and the carne asada taco. The guacamole is amazing as well.

Holy wowza - deliciousness, and incredibly healthy too. Had the veggie salad with some grilled tofu added and couldn't have been happier. Fresh veggies - where do they get them??? A nice red wine vinaigrette lightly tossed about. Hubby had the turkey sandwich and it was fresh as well. Bread was a bit dry but the sammy fixin's helped with that. Service is quick and there is seating indoors and out. Busy busy Sunday mid-day and I bet when school is in, this place is really hopping. Very welcome addition to the Mill Avenue/ASU area. YUM.

Nondescript. Almost missed it. Sent here by the man working the counter at the bookstore down the street. Which BTW was AWESOME too. They serve little Russian-style dumplings here with an incredible mix of meet and/or potato. They're cooked to order, so you'll wait a few minutes. Who cares? Tender and delicious, covered with butter, sriracha, seasonings, and get the sour cream too. They're a bit spicy but really really delicious. I'd go again in a hot second.

We love this place for their unique beer offerings, outdoor patio, and friendly service. We've had every beer on the menu, several of their delicious burgers, and the crispy duck fat fries. Last time we were there I had the veggie burger and it was a surprising treat - black beans fried to a generous crisp. They are crowded evenings and weekends so plan ahead. Really nice.

We popped in here late in the lunch hour and considered ourselves very lucky. This might be some of the best sushi I have ever eaten. Extremely dedicated to the craft with purple rice and fresh, flavorful ingredients. We sampled six different rolls and three different sashimis. All were amazing. The miso soup is wonderful, the tempura is lightly battered and fresh, the service was terrific, and the sake bombs ... well... they lit the party. Can't wait to go back and try the green tea ice cream too. This little gem is going to be your favorite sushi place too. Hit them up!!

Heavenly scent of fresh-baked croissants and goodies await as you enter this darling establishment. The food here is every bit as good (and seems better) than the Tempe location. How can that be?? I love the uniquely oversized lime green mixer as you enter Essence. I had a delicious arugula salad with dates and crispy pepper bacon and a luscious cheese croissant. My friend had the homestyle ham and bean soup with grilled cheese sammie. The macarons - what else is there to say? Delish! Please never leave us Essence!!

So I had never heard of Steak 'n Shake but I guess it's something big in the Midwest. Super friendly service here at the Mill Avenue location and dynamite burgers. You've got your choice of all kinds of different styles and toppings which is nice. The fries are super crispy (perfect) and nicely portioned. Good music playing while we were there and the place is clean! Oh, and by the way... the milkshakes are phenomenal. Don't miss 'em. Especially the salted caramel pretzel milkshake. OMG.

First time visit to this location and as standard with the other locations - friendly, timely, informative service. We enjoyed our Sunday afternoon sipping a few draft choices and noshing on the delicious chocolate bread pudding. Their pasty's are quite good too, but we were only in for dessert. You won't be disappointed either way. Thanks!!

Ingo's - I really like your food, your service, your beer, your everything... but I HATE your flies!! There has to be something that can be done to keep the little pests out of my plate of food. It was nightmarish. I had the veggie burger and loved it, especially on one of the LGO English muffins. Very nice selection. Fries, and sides are all good, and the beer choices were excellent. Great vibe - get rid of the flies!!

Yum and Yum and Yum. So many varied and delicious choices of shellfish and New Orleans' style sammies too. We had shrimp and crab and mussels and couldn't be happier. This place is messy, so don't wear your finest. Be casual and enjoy the most delicious boil of your life. The beer is Abita and it's cold too.

I'm pretty sure I won't be able to say enough good things about this restaurant. Jeez - everything from the delectable adult beverages, through the amazing appetizers, to the main courses - wow!!! Over the top delicious. It's another one of those places I don't want to get too crowded, but I don't want it to go away. Stay busy, but not too busy, you know? Head over there - you won't regret the Papa Rellena for starters, the Arroz con Pollo with its perfectly seasoned chicken and yellow rice (enough for 2, btw), or the Carapulcra - a heavenly potato stew with yucca that I still can't get out of my mind. Enjoy. I know you will.

Had a wonderful first time here painting and relaxing. The shop is clean and well-organized, the teachers are efficiently patient, and my work of art turned out better than I expected. I love the step-by-step fun and the fact that your piece is dried by the time you head home. I felt sorry for our teacher though because there were some very rude patrons talking above her. That made it difficult for everyone else, but hey... still a great time and I've already made plans for another visit!

Sometimes there are no words... just groans of delight. We arrived about 12:20pm and stood in line under misters and in the shade (thank you VERY much!) for about 15 minutes. I would wait all day for this stuff!! First-timers here and we couldn't wait to try a few delicacies. The heady aroma of fresh smoky barbecue saturated my senses while waiting. Thanks for the ice cold water too. Onward - we tried the fatty brisket (yowza), the ribs (oh my), the pulled pork (a new favorite), and today's special pastrami (oh, yeah.) A couple of slices of white bread, a side of rich meaty beans, and their delicious house bbq sauce and we're set. I can't wait to revisit and wait in line again and again and again. BTW - by 1:00pm, they were just about out of a few things, so plan your wait-time accordingly. GO!

LOVE it!!! You can see everything from the atop the high roller. Well worth the price and so glad we did it. We went daytime and didn't regret it at all. I imagine at night the lights are brilliant but you wouldn't be able to see as far. Choose for yourself, but we loved it.

First time in and boy were they crowded. The staff was hustling like nobody's business and getting fresh stuff out quickly. I ordered a chocolate dream smoothie and the carob avocado mixture was just like drinking a chocolate shake. The berry smoothie was also very very good and as I watched the acai bowls go by, I was drooling. They are friendly, quick, and supremely healthy. Can't wait to go back and get another one!!

We just happened upon this wonderful little place. I believe it's in a newer location and we couldn't be happier. Every plate of food we had was traditional and tasty. The vegetarian etoufee was the biggest surprise with its creamy vegetable sauce over perfectly cooked rice. The jambalaya and gumbo choices were fabulous, especially the duck option. Food is a teeny bit spicy here so be prepared to grab a chilled Abita beer with dinner. Can't wait to get back!

Thank you thank you thank you for having chocolate and coconut sorbet at your airport location. I could not be happier - no dairy for me but creamy deliciousness. Can't wait to fly out of Terminal 4 again!!!

Hope this place makes it in the current location. We've been hankering for something to make it here and this may be the place. The name is truly funky, but it's a chair from the Midwest, so go figure. Walk in and be welcomed by amazingly friendly folks and place your order for hot fresh frosted donuts. Loads of choices and combinations for your crispy frittered delight... enjoy my friends... enjoy.

Loved the food, the location, the service, the food, the location, the service... and I could go on and on. This very health-conscious eatery has me wanting to return. Great protein bowls, wonderful salads, and extraordinary baked goods. The smoothies are also amazing. Try it - even if you're not into healthy food, it's very good.

Stopped in here today based on a friend's positive appraisal. The place was very clean, easy to find, and smelled delicious. We've been hankering for a local place that serves up some old-school Chinese food that's fresh, hot, and doesn't turn our stomachs. I think we found it. Everything we ordered was piping hot and fresh. Crunchy veggies, flavorful chicken and beef, tons of eggs in the soup. Service was quick too. Will definitely be back, hope they stick around!!

I was a bit skeptical after bad experiences with the previous restaurant on this site, but not to worry  -  It was Fantastic!! Breakfast was as good as any I've ever experienced. The home-made spam was flavorful with a hint of paprika ?? and spicy goodness. Eggs were cooked perfectly, the grits were creamy good, and the biscuit - oh my land. It was baked to perfection. Service was congenial, and timely. The place was spic-and-span clean to boot. As I was leaving a woman in one of the booths was noshing on the blueberry pancakes and they have my name all over them for next time. Yes, next time. Thanks Biscuits for coming to our neighborhood. We needed you!!!

So looking forward to trying this place and was sorely disappointed. Entering the courtyard on a chilly December evening and the lights were twinkling and fire stoked in the corner fireplace. Artistically designed booth backs with old suits in a quilt pattern were intriguing, but that's where the ambience stopped. We were greeted and seated with a lack of emotion or warmth. Menus were placed in front of us and they were ... dirty. No specials mentioned, no happy hour mentioned (we were there at the start of HH), and a general lackluster vibe ensued. When questioned, our waiter knew nothing of the drink concoctions (shame on him) and told us the sign on the wall with specials was outdated because they didn't have chalk-skills. We finally decided on a few items - Pablo Honey cocktail was TOO spicy to even drink, but the fresh pineapple juice helped a lot. Chips and salsa were requested and dropped on the table. Delicious salsa - greasy but hot tortilla chips. Free on the Happy Hour Menu, but $5 otherwise. Shared the short rib dinner (pretty good), the vegetarian squash option (soggy with a very spicy avocado mixture), the duck taquitos (YUMMMY) and the green pork chile stew (decent flavor and good consistency.) Nothing special here - sorry. Oh, and we were charged for the FREE Happy Hour Chips & Salsa. Embarrassingly slow service, but the guy filling our water glasses - on it!! Won't be back.

Really good beer on a hot summer day in a nicely air-conditioned spot - oh yes. Every beer we sampled was good, not too hoppy, and just the way we like it. Friendly, efficient customer service, and great sweet potato fries too!! We'll be back.

Can't remember if I have reviewed this location before, but here goes. Great service - almost better than the Arcadia location. Delicious, delectable bruschetta, homemade flavored tomato Florentine soup, and paninis that were dynamite. The wine and beer selection is top-notch and the recommendations from our wait staff were spot-on. I love the ambience here with the open to the patio bar area - a nice way to entertain both sides of the house. Easy walking distance to downtown Tempe, ASU, Gammage, and ample parking. A hit any way you look at it!!

Wow!! Great service, great food, incredible choices and options for everyone in our party of five. I seriously cannot remember the name of one dish we ordered but it was all delicious from start to finish - the Japanese kabobs, the miso soup, the fresh sushi, and on and on to the dairy-free ice cream dessert. Can't wait to get back!!

Great place for Sunday NFL football breakfast. Great food and good service to boot. The Cronut French Toast is to die for and their mimosas are champagne-heavy yum. We snacked our way through the lunch menu and enjoyed the nachos, burgers, wings, and tacos - all made with a variety of yummy game meats. This kid-friendly bar has ski-ball and stand-up video games too so bring the fam. Love it and will be back!!

I am falling more in love with this place each and every day. Super clean eating area and the back area looks spanking clean too. Friendly service, great burritos, and the tamales are soo soo good. Smells like Mexican Food Heaven in here my friends - good for a quick breakfast/lunch bite or late night grub after a night on the town.

Unique, unusual, out of the ordinary, different, all that and TASTY!! The chocolate donut had a lovely spice to it - a little bit cinnamon, ginger, maybe cardamom?? SO good with a chocolate walnut frosting. The orange-vanilla donut was all that - concentrated vanilla cake with a delicate orange/vanilla frosting. I'd hit them up again and again and again.

Stand-out great little place in a neighborhood filled with great little places. Love the giant blackboard menu for wine and beer, both draft and bottled. A wonderfully diverse selection to make your selection. Friendly and attentive bar service and the coolest restrooms ever. Lotion anyone? Loads of board game choices and 80's video games too. The grilled cheese sammies smelled heavenly but we were here for the beer. It's compact with music at just the right decibel. Super chill vibe, I will definitely return.

We've been here twice and had a good experience both times. Loving the food and beer selections. Brunch options are all quite good - we enjoyed the loco moco, breakfast nachos, and terrific outdoor vibe. This place has a wonderful patio area (dog-friendly) and clean (TV'd) indoor area too. Service is friendly, but a bit lax in certain areas. Please mention the specials to us next time, and bring water a tad more frequently please. Otherwise - really good experience. I'll be back.

We've been once before and couldn't wait to get back. Their Social Hour is incredibly priced with wonderfully prepared treats. Think fresh seared ahi, cheese fondue, pork rinds, spiced nuts, olives, watermelon salad, mac & cheese, and more. The beverages are perfection, and the service cannot be beat. Love it.

New kid on the block and a winner for sure. Upon entering you'll be dazzled by the colorful décor and the gracious service. This is a very affordable little spot right near a neighborhood bar, a great cupcake shop, and the $3 Cinema. We were wowed by the flavorful salsa put before us - not too spicy at all. And the chips kept coming.... Terrific icy margaritas (I'd get the rocks marg next time) and well-priced beverages. Every single thing we tried was delectable ... except the tamale. Why is that? No matter, everything else was delicious and we'll probably make this our neighborhood Mexican spot for dinner. Their brunch menu looked pretty tasty too. YUM.

This was our first time here, and it won't be our last. The service from start to finish was amazingly friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Thanks Tate!! Fresh baked bread with olive oil and pesto, perfectly grilled fish - we shared the Ahi and the Salmon, and wonderful veggies. The zucchini was probably the best I've ever had and their sweet potato mash... yum. The jasmine rice was a perfect complement to the fish as well. No dessert tonight, but next time for sure. Check it out!!

I have now been to all the Snooze locations and enjoy their breakfast offerings. The pancakes are always sweet and delicious, and the bennies are very flavorful. I love the mix and match menu options for both pancakes and eggs benedict. That makes it easier for us. But this place is SO crowded. Plan on waiting up to 45 minutes on the weekend for sure. But hit them up - really fine breakfast goodies ... skip the hash browns though (they're kinda meh.)

The food here is good. That's right ... good. We loved the chicken and potatoes, the rice and beans, the plantain wrapped (tamale??), and the friendly service. It's small. It's clean. It's just right - try them out!!

I have frequented this location through all of its transitions. I loved them all and am happy this place is still a piano bar. I like the clean vibe and the extra seating in this latest move. The acoustics are not as good as I remember - something to think about.... Drinks are standard and the wait staff was attentive. It's a great place to bring out-of-town late-night guests!

First time visit to this spot owned by the same people who bring you "Switch" next door. I had high hopes the moment I walked through the door. Summer Saturday afternoon - not too busy and seated at a high boy immediately. There were a few patrons at the bar and a few couples seated in cozy booths as well. You've got choices here! Saturday and Sunday mornings offer a little brunch menu with the star of the show being their carafes of Bellinis or Bloody Mary's. We opted for the Grapefruit Bellini first and the Ginger Peach the second time around. Both were thirst-quenching and had appreciably enough 'good-morning' kick. Sampling through menu with a bacon/cheese board (crispy well-flavored bacon, fruit, veggies, cheese dip, and a little fried cheese too), on to fried calamari (a bit soggier than I'd prefer), and then a scallop plate (4 minis with a scoop of mashed potatoes.) All in all, I felt that the food was very good. We finished up with a slice of German Chocolate Cake - chocolately but not overly sweet with a scoop of vanilla/coconut ice cream. The ice cream had an interesting coconut gelee within. Good but interesting. My favorite part of the visit had to be our server, Dante. He was warm, personable, friendly, and efficient. His recommendations were spot-on. I'd visit again... it was that good!

Not one complaint. Not one!! Saturday morning and perfect indoor/outdoor seating for our group of ten ladies celebrating Galentine's Day. Excellent service, perfect beverage selection, and great food. We loved the smoked brisket, the chimichanga, the eggs & tortillas, the avocado toast, and the smoked beets. Wow - all so yummy. I loved that our waiter delivered a perfect beer-mosa for me, not everyone can do that just right. He never blinked an eye at our desire for split checks, even suggesting it from the start. I love that about a waiter and want to heap a better tip for his service. We ventured over to the coffee bar after for some chamomile tea and lattes - great service with friendly smiles and perfect beverages. I can't wait to come back!!!

First time at this location and it was just as good as all the rest. Great selection of yummy breakfast treats. The Yard has a parking situation, so be forewarned - it's crowded!! Ride your bike over or walk and you'll be happy enough. The food is so so good. Think light and fluffy pancakes, sweet pumpkin bread French toast, and flavorful loco moco. Service is stellar and the selection of morning beverages is perfect. Loved it.

I like Fate Brewing. I really really do. I'll be back to try some food next time, but did love the choice of beers on tap. There's something so welcoming and cozy about their patio and you may forget it's on a busy street - it's just that lovely.

Oh Wow. This little place has two sides - a sit down restaurant, and a tapas bar. We opted for the tapas bar (casual as we were) and were not disappointed. The small bites on baguette were incredible. We died for the blood sausage for sure - our favorite. Loved the PB&J with pork smear, jam, and peanuts too. The olives were zesty and warm - love warm olives. Service was very attentive, and the cocktails were perfection indeed. I would hit them up again and again for their food and service.

I cannot get this place out of my mind. I have been hankering for excellent southern-style dishes and ... eureka! I have found it. No reservations accepted here and the place is small my friends. But no worries - their bar menu is styled appropriately with throw-back cocktails and southern influenced delights. You will be happy with any choice from their bar menu, rest assured. For appies we went straight for the fried dilly beans and didn't look back. After that we had the hush puppies. Both items were tenderly (not overly) fried and flavorful. For entrees we headed to the Tennessee hot fried chicken (not too spicy); the pork cheek pot pie (novel and YUM) and the two-wash hen and dumplings. Now my favorite thing on the table was the hen dinner and hubby loved the pot pie. Go ahead and check it out for yourself. But, don't skip dessert. Our homemade pie was a dream - something different every night I believe. Enjoy!!

What a find!!! This hidden gem near downtown Phoenix had a nice little outdoor patio, the friendliest welcome, a delicious menu, and stellar chocolate cake!! We were greeted upon entering and could not believe all the yummy choices on their menu (very meat heavy btw.) I chose the Sausage Arepas with spicy chorizo, fresh eggs, avocado, and tangy salsa. You can cover yours with creme fraiche, but I could not. My friend had the special - chicken fried steak and creamy gravy - oh my yum. Our hot teas were refilled, the service was excellent, and when they brought out our piece of chocolate cake I thought I had died and gone straight to Godiva Heaven. Rich and fudgy with chips throughout. Wow. I can't wait to go back, and believe me... I will and I'll bring my friends too!!

Love this place. I've been here now a few times and they've worked out all the kinks. Great food. Great beer choices. Great service. Great atmosphere. It's located right in the heart of Mill Avenue, but just off the street. It's dog-friendly and the patio space heaters are a great touch. Come and play a few yard games and hang out with your pals. You won't be disappointed.

Imagine plate after gorgeous plate of delicious Asian apps and entrees. Our party of five started out with sake & soju all around. The crisp apple soju was a sweet treat, but the unfiltered pear was even better. We started out with a few typical choices - edamame, bbq pork and chicken skewers, and delicate veggie tempura. Then we wandered through a zesty squid salad and fresh seaweed salad, both were terrific. We loved the crispy gyoza dumplings, the incredibly flavorful tuna tartare, and the udon noodles flavored with zucchini and beef, and finally the spicy fried chicken. Every single dish was perfectly prepared, delivered graciously, and so so good. I cannot wait to get back here and try a few more items on the menu. We were too early for their sushi menu, but it looked pretty good too. Loved it Loved it Loved it.

This might have been my favorite meal in Madison. Yes, Yes, it was. Service was attentive and friendly, and the place is clean and modern. We loved sitting near the front window and looking out at the gorgeous capitol building. We shared a couple of really good dishes - the tofu taco was a big hit, and so was the three-cup chicken. Great flavoring and cooked so tenderly. A few bits of sushi that had tempura pineapple - oh my land - tempura pineapple!! I can only imagine the chef was sitting around one night and thought... "let's through pineapple in." And it works. Hit them up.

Have so been wanting to try Southern Rail and finally got a chance. It's in a great location near the brand-new Changing Hands in Phoenix. Outdoor seating with heaters and the fireplace on a fairly brisk evening - gorgeous! Terrific service throughout the evening. They were out of DiSaranno for one of their specialty cocktails and the bartender made us a surprise - out of this world! Food is really good here... jambalaya, fried green tomatoes, bbq ribs, cornbread salad, succotash, and sweet potatoes. All of it wonderful. I am surprised that they don't have fried chicken on the menu every day - really surprised. You'll have to visit on a Wednesday for that item. Desserts were only passable - the beignets were rather donut like, not light and airy like they are in New Orleans. The bread pudding (highly praised) was cold in the middle and dense. Otherwise... a perfect meal.
