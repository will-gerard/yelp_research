First don't tell me I can't sit in the booth when no one is in the restaurant. Service was horrible, we ended up walking out.

I really like the Orange peel chicken. Great semi fast food that is good and priced right. And they have great iced tea!

Great breakfast burritos and salsas! The ice tea is flavored so nicely. Outdoor seating is perfect.

Good place to have "authentic" Mexican food. Love the fact that they have the pan dulce right when you walk in. They also had good Spanish music playing rather than some cheezy Spanish music you would normally hear at restaurants.

Good staff, food, drinks and fantastic decor! It is a must see if your in old town. The staff when I walked in had the most positive attitude and turned my "hangry" mood inside out.  Thanks ladies!
