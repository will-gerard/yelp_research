Food was up to par today. My last experience was mediocre and still decided to give this place another try. We ended up with the same unfriendly and rude bartender.  It was like once he realized we were only doing margaritas and an appetizer, we were not worth his time. I had to walk up to the bar to get my food warmed up and had to wait 10-15 mins to get a refill on salsa after I initially requested it. It also took him another 10 mins or so to bring the bill after I initially requested it. He didn't have a problem stopping at other tables within the bar area to make small talk, provide refills or tabs to the two other occupied tables. If he was overwhelmed my advice would be to get an actual server in the bar area and he could stick to making drinks.

I hate to have to give this place two stars as I've been a loyal customer at the other locations. The food was unbelievably great and the service was unbearable.

I had a great time here with friends.. Had a little bit of everything. Big fan of the Black and Yellow and Chicken Katsu. Tried the Crunch Lollipop too, it was a little too sweet for my taste buds.  Fantastic service and laid back environment.

Best fried/fast seafood spot in AZ. They don't try to compare themselves to ritzy fresh seafood joints. You are getting what you pay for.. A yummy cheap seafood grease party in your mouth. Huge fan of the fried shrimp and cocktail sauce. I would recommend eating your food there as take out orders don't taste the same after the drive home. I've read some of these other reviews, these folks are just missing the concept. As for all the million cars in the drive thru and long lines at the window.. These people get it and for some reason don't write reviews. I just wish you all would open one in the north valley!

Had lunch there today and Shane was our server. It was a busy beautiful sunny day on the patio but he was always available to meet all of our needs. Drank a fantastic pineapple mojito, enjoyed the crab cakes and steak salad. All were absolutely fantastic and would recommend them! The bread with the cinnamon/honey butter is definitely my guilty pleasure. The reason why I couldn't give them 5 stars today is because we split the large proportionate steak salad and they had us separate the food ourselves on the small 2 top table.

Brought a friend here for his first taste of Arizona Mexican food. It was the perfect place to start with the chimis and tequila. Service was speedy and attentive even on a busy Saturday night. Not a huge fan of the salsa and hot sauce but the fabulous dinner platters make up for it. Red chili chimi is my recommendation.

Twice I have to had a prescription filled at this location. I call it in, they tell me it will be ready in one hour, I receive the automated call about a hour later stating it is ready for pick up. I leave work, go down there and they inform me they don't have the medication at this location and it will be delivered tomorrow.  The only reason why I give them two stars is because the techs were very apologetic and attempted to find the medication at other locations for same day pick up.

Went there for lunch today and this had to be one of the worst eating out experiences I have had in a long time.  To start, it took 8 mins before anyone acknowledged me sitting there. It wasn't until my friend showed up until we were greeted and asked for drinks. We knew what we wanted so we ordered our food at that time too. The meal did come out timely even with the lunch rush. (Earned one star). However, we noticed instantly that there was a long black hair in the coleslaw. No one came back to refill our drinks or ask how the meal was. We were forced to eat the remaining part of our meals while the black hair in the food started at us. The salad plate and side dish were stacked on top of each other at the end of our small 2 person booth. No one stopped to pick it up. We waited and waited for the server to come by so we could get out check. I eventually had to flag down another server to help find ours. At that time we made him aware of the black hair, requested that side item to be removed off the bill. He finally removed those dishes from the table but left our other food plates in front of us.  The manager came by (2nd star earned) apologized and removed an entire meal off the bill. He was the one that removed the last of the remaining food plates.  It took us 1 and a half hours to eat lunch and check out at this place. With the hair, crummy service and mediocre food, we will not be going back.

The food is awesome and I crave this place! The staff could cheer up a bit or act like they enjoy their jobs.. That's the only reason I can't give it 5 stars.

Update! I came in tonight excited for the green chili on this Arizona chilly day. The gal at front greeted me with a smile, made small talk, while we waited for my credit card to process and thanked me for the tip I left her. There was even 80's music jamming in there that I was able to listen to while I waited for my Togo order. Definitely a different experience but a much better one!    The food is awesome and I crave this place! The staff could cheer up a bit or act like they enjoy their jobs.. That's the only reason I can't give it 5 stars.

Food was fantastic, had the smoked salmon and specialty espresso vodka drink. I had Jamison added to the drink, she charged me 7.50 for an additional shot that was obviously not placed in my drink. Which made one drink $15.50.. Which is why I have to provide only a 4 star rating. Staff was friendly but a little slow which was understandable due to the size of our party on the patio. I never received the extra side of cream cheese that I requested but luckily my buddy had some left over. This makes me think that I should rate this place a little lower but I made the best of the ambience and really enjoyed my company. I will definitely be back but with a smaller group and excited to try some of the other dishes.

8am on a Saturday morning I called to get their hours. The owner answered, cheerfully she told me that they don't open for two hours but still invited me to come in. Great service and I will be back!!

I stopped in here to pick up a burger to go. The hostess recommended the open pit with the Bbq sauce and bacon. Glad she did because it was delicious. I hung out at the bar while I waited on my food and I was a little envious of the folks day drinking on the patio. This spot is nice for the area, you don't see many casual day drinking spots. I'll have to come another time so I can drink some Purple Haze on their tap.

Ordered delivery from here a couple months ago. Had the buffalo chicken pizza with an order of the garlic knots. They were fantastic! Just moved to the area and was excited to order from here again. Placed a pick up order today for the buffalo chicken pizza with an extra side of buffalo sauce and blue cheese. Brought the pizza home to find it was only a cheese with chicken pizza soaked in buffalo sauce. For someone who loves buffalo sauce enough to order an extra side of it, the food wasn't even edible. Per the Yelp menu, the chicken is tossed in the buffalo sauce not the entire pizza. It was also missing the ranch and onions that were supposed to be on it. The blue cheese side tasted spoiled. The food was such a disappointment that I almost called to ask for my $20 back. Super bummed that this place is not consistent with the food they make. I provided two stars because of the past meal I had with them.

Having an older vehicle I needed to find a repair shop that didn't gouge my pocket book and provided honest work. My dad recommended this spot about 4 years ago and I have had a healthy relationship with them ever since. I've visited them at least 6 times and I have never had to go back to have them redo work. I still shop the prices for my own piece of mind and no one beats theirs.

I was immediately greeted with friendly faces. Nicolas was our waiter and very patient since it was our first time. He also had great recommendations like the house rustic margarita and steak tacos. We went with the mixed taco platter and was impressed. The lettuce option was awesome. Wasn't a fan of the pork tacos but hey.. That is 4 out of 5 different tacos that we loved. Definitely a taco paradise! We will be back!

While having a family dinner here tonight attempting to celebrate a birthday, an older gentleman came over to our table and threatened our family and small children out of nowhere. He kept trying to move himself closer to the children at the table and became aggressive when we wouldn't permit it. I wouldn't have thought any wrong doing from the restaurant except for the manager's response when he eventually came out to the ruckus. He explained to us that this man was a regular customer and was not right in the head. Dismissed us and when back to his office. I am concerned that this is a kid friendly restaurant where management isn't concerned with the safety of the small children or other paying customers.  We didn't even receive an apology.  Be aware this is not a safe environment and this was an intense/scary situation that I would not like to see happen to anyone else. Since again, this man is a regular customer and will be back. Police were called by my family, not the restaurant and I hope this man gets the help that he needs.

Went at about 7pm on a Monday night. Bruce was our bartender and was perfect. Served us the right kind of beer and great recommendations on the food. We tried the pretzel for the appetizer and the veggie panini. Only could give 4 stars because I felt the proportion of the appetizer could have been larger for the cost and our French fries came out almost cold. We split the entree and they already had it on separate plates for us. Way to keep it classy and keep things simple for us.  I wasn't thrilled reading about a patio bar being kid friendly which why we decided on a later time. I do feel that this place is overall under rated on yelp. The ambience is great, the type of food is exactly what they advertise and service was fantastic.

We called to make appointments and they honored them. Usually nail salons just say "Yes.. Yes.. Come in" and you are stuck waiting for 45 mins.  The gals did a fabulous job on our feet. Love the different options they provide in the different types of pedicures.  It environment was laid back, everyone giggle and chit chatted about the movie playing. Definitely a different type of nail salon experience along with the mimosas provided. We will be back!

The start off to our evening was a little rough. The rest of the building was closed down due to a private party so the overflow was directed here. Due to the uncommon traffic on a Monday night the servers were slightly overwhelmed. Once it was made known we were slightly neglected our server Nick was all about making up for the start of our evening. He came out to our table "manned up" for the oversight and went out of his way to change our experience. We will definitely be back and a huge shout out to Nick the man!! A big thank you!!

Very disappointed with the portions vs the prices. Food was flavorless and I can only assume it was frozen meat. I ordered the lobster roll, it came out in a tin bowl with a lettuce base underneath it and the fries. I am assuming this was an attempt to make the meal look larger but it caused my fries and bread to be soggy. It also came with a 3oz of coleslaw and one oz of ketchup.. I hope they don't break the bank with giving me those "large" side items... I am giving it two stars, one for our nice server and the other for the coleslaw. Just wish it was a larger portion since it was the only item with flavor.

I finally made it for dinner with a friend and we both overly enjoyed our meal. We sat up at the bar and had the wonderful Dove take care of us. The mixed drinks were on point and the food was exactly what we were craving. Started off with the blue cheese chips, scarfed down the Whiskey Jack burger on a pretzel bun, it was complimented with the famous Mac/cheese and deviled potato salad. Finally a place that was worth cheating on our summer diets for!  Unfortunately I only snapped a pic of our appetizer because we were just too excited to dig into the main course. My only feedback.. It would have been nice to have a band in there for our Saturday dinner.

Found this place on Yelp two days ago and we already had to bring the rest of the family in. 9am on a Saturday morning with no wait, we were greeted enthusiastically by at least 5 people when we walked through the door and 3 people teamed up to get our party of 7 sat. It was refreshing being somewhere that these folks obviously want to be and enjoy their jobs. The food came out timely, refills constantly happened throughout the meal and we were regularly checked in on.  I don't even know where to start on the food. FANTASTIC!  This is a place I will definitely come back to when I am back in town and deserves a 10 star rating!

Came in with a party of 9.. Had a blast. Little Miss Jordann took care of us and so did they bartender Jeffro. Food was on point as always. Can't go wrong with the shrimp, snow crab, hush puppies, pizza, calamari, mussels, brisket, cheese cake and chocolate cake with ice cream. Safe to say we had a little bit of everything. We will be back!!

I went here for lunch today. Service exceeded my expectations for a newly opened restaurant. I had the Texan burger with sweet potato fries. I ordered the burger medium and it did come out well done. It was dry and I did have to order extra Bbq sauce to compensate. I'm thinking maybe it needed lettuce, tomato and mayo to add to it. I'm just not sure, it was a little too basic. I still ate all of it. The sweet potato fries were scrumptious! My mother ordered the salmon plate, the salmon did look a little dry. She claimed the rice and veggies were flavorless but she is a hard cookie to please. The happy hour menu did look intriguing and look forward to coming back to try some of those adult beverages. The manager did come by to ask us how our meal was but I didn't permit my mother to say anything because both of us ate our entire meal and we were time constricted. It would have looked like we were complaining to just complain. I'm sure she would have listened and done something to compensate. I know this is a newly opened restaurant and they have little quirks to work out so I will not write it off. I feel this place deserves 3.5 stars but that is not an option on here. Figured due to the service, I have no problem rounding up.  I really do want to try out one of those chili dogs!

Love this place and the all day happy hour specials on Sunday. I've been in here multiple times and will keep coming back. The seafood always tastes and smells fresh. Service is always on point. I almost don't want others to find out about this place and enjoy how low key it is.
