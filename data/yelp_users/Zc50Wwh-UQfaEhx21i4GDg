Not the worst experience but for sure the worst quality. I had a gift certificate so I came in for a gel manicure. The staff was very nice and friendly but when I look at my fingers I can't help to only think "thank goodness I didn't spend any money on this."    The gels don't feel as thick as when I usually get gels but we will see.  I also have never gotten designs but this time I thought I'll go for it. Well as I looked at samples I found a few designs I liked but they all looked sloppy. I thought it was just because they were painting on plastic not a nail so maybe it changed the quality? Idk. But it didn't. I had to request the design for be removed because it was so sloppy.   Aside from the quality of service their shop was also filthy.  I watched them "wash" the foot spa and it was wiping with water, a sponge (repeatedly used) and NO SOAP.  Maybe it's just me, but GROSS. After seeing that I couldn't help but let my eyes wander around and well, I soon regretted that. The whole place needs a serious makeover- it just feels "grimy."

Yum! I think it was sometime last August when I first tried Liberty Market. My friend and I met there with our small lap dogs for dinner. Having not been there before, we didn't realize that even if you want to eat on the patio, you need to order your meal from inside the restaurant - not an ideal situation having the pups with us and all. One of the waitresses saw us with our dogs looking sort of stumped and told us to come around the side of the building to the coffee area.  There, we were able to stand in the doorway and order our food, to eat on the patio with our dogs as intended! Not only was the food tasty ( I had the spaghetti and meatballs), but the service was beyond accommodating and for that reason I am a repeat customer.

This place is great!  At my place of work we have to continuously get our linens cleaned and this has been our company of choice for many years.  They have very kind employees and have always provided wonderful service.  Not only are their prices awesome but management is too!  Thank you Seville Cleaners!

I had contemplated between apple and another third party computer repair shop  but had heard such great things (from more than a few companies) that Mac Masters was the best.  First, you should know I hardly ever do company reviews, but they were so awesome I had to! Second, if you want excellent customer service, with no problems - go to them!  I emailed them on Wednesday (a day I didn't realize they were closed) for a quote about my macbook lcd and glass being broken and needing to be replaced.  Even though there office was closed, I still got an email from a real person that explained they were off but to bring it in so they can evaluate and give me an estimate.  I found this to be a great first impression - how many companies do you know that will email you, from a real person AND on a day they are closed.    When I went in on Thursday, the gentleman who I was emailing remembered me and immediately addressed my problem.  When he gave me an estimate for my macbook pro it was $100 more than I had been quoted at other places, including apple. My first reaction was to go to one of the other stores because of the price difference but when he explained why it was more expensive - it was completely worth it.   He reminded me that when you go through Apple the turn around time is 2-3 weeks, shipping out your computer, etc.  He also explained that places (like the store mentioned above) only really provide a "quick fix", the labor is done by someone who works on "computers" but if you have a mac product, you understand - mac is different.  These guys, at Mac Masters, really are mac masters, and who else would you trust to work on your computer?  And the cherry on top, the ultimate selling point to this additional $100......... they told me they had the parts in stock (which many others have to order) and they could have my laptop fixed by that same night or the next morning.  I picked up my computer at 5:20 that night, only 5 hours after dropping off. For me, the convenience was 100% worth it.    This was the best experience I have ever had with a computer repair and probably one of the best experiences i have ever had with any store.  Not only is the service great and professional, but every member of their staff was kind, easy to work with, understanding and funny.  I would recommend them to anybody!!

Jeff and the guys are awesome! I have taken my car here for all needs for about a year now.  I have never worked with such a personable and kind repair shop until these guys.  There have been a few times  they  helped me out with last minute/ "rushed" fixes and even extended hours just to help.  They understand life happens and they don't give you trouble for it or make you feel in anyway guilty.    I will continue to come to Crawfords, they are my go to repair shop.  I promise you, you will be happy.  Yelp was the whole reason I started going to them, and so far  they have proven to provide high levels of customer service  over and over again.  Hope this helps you too!

My boyfriend and I and our min-pin chihuahua headed up to the fountain and Yelped for lunch. The food was great and Molly (boss) was SO nice! My boyfriend said its cool cause there's no where else you would get that combination hotdog and it was delicious! It was a cute little place and we'd totally go back.  :) They even gave me a doggie hotdog to-go for our dog!
