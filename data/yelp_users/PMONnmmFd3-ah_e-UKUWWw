I was hoping that this would be a great place near to my home for Mongolian BBQ, but unfortunately it didn't quite hit the mark.  There are much better options in the valley

Happy to give a strong recommendation to this place - fun atmosphere, great service, excellent food... and really loved the made-at-the-table s'mores!  I recommend this for anyone who has out of town guests for a little bit of the 'old west' and good fun.  All you can eat BBQ on Saturday and Sunday during the day.

If they would open one in Central Phoenix near my home, I would be happy to give them a 5!  The location is a bit far for a regular visit.  Build one in central phoenix, make it bigger with more selections!  I went for the weekend buffet and it was quite good.  There were limited selections, however, and I did not see some of my very favorite Middle East dishes. The stuffed grape leaves tasted like they were from a can instead of homemade, but I could be wrong on that.  However, the food they did have on the buffet was excellent and I will certainly make the 45 minute drive again for the food when I need more!

Went here for the great groupon offering that I found - well worth it!  First of all, this is not Afghan food - this is Mediterranean and Persian.  (hopefully you true foodies out there know the difference).  We went on a Tuesday evening and I had the Tuesday special - a delicious Persian stew that I would order again and again.    This is not a fancy place to go, but the food is tasty.  It's like the McD's equivalent of the nearby Persian Room!    Definitely go if you are in the area.  It's worth it.

I really wanted to like this place... My partner and I were thrilled to see a Mediterranean Buffet open in Central Phoenix... a food type that has been sadly overlooked in this part of town.  We saw the sign and went in hoping for the best.  We were the only customers, though another couple did come in, look at the buffet, and leave.  The food was mediocre, but I do have to say the potatoes and the tabouleh were both very good.  Most of the other food looked like leftovers from lunch or the day before.    Owners - if you are reading this, you still have some great potential with this place.  Here is what you have to do if you want my business again: 1- Get rid of the Asian Decor and invest in actually making the place LOOK like the Mediterranean place you want to be.  For a few thousand dollars, you could make this place look really cool  2- Don't worry about filling up all four of the buffets.  Why not close down two of them and focus on putting out half the food - but make it REALLY good!  That would cut down on your food waste and get people excited about your food  3- Sorry, but Naan, curries, and other Indian delights are not Mediterranean.  Just leave them off.  Did I see burritos on the buffet as well?  Really now!  4 - I want to like this place, consider closing for a week and redecorate, redesign the menu on the buffet, and try again.  Unfortunately, like it is right now I don't think  you will see us back any time soon.

Wonderful dinner there this evening.  I asked for the "best thing on the menu" and was directed to the Pumpkin Curry - definitely was a great choice!  I have not seen that on a menu in ages!  Appetizer of soup was fantastic as well - though I don't recall the Thai name, it was "Tom..." the one without coconut milk in order to reduce the calories a bit.  TASTY!  Staff is friendly, food is good, atmosphere is relaxing and enjoyable.  I live very close and see me returning here time and time again.  DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE LIGHTRAIL CONSTRUCTION... we need more places like this on the 19th ave corridor, so I encourage all to give this place a shot.
