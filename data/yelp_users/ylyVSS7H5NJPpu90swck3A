I think this place is 3 and a half stars. It is a fair-to-good, family-run restaurant, and because it is the only Indian place I know of in central Phoenix, I've been there quite a few times, only for dinner.  The atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed, with kind service, booth seating and Bollywood videos to entertain you. It's not the kind of place to take a date you want to impress, but it's the kind of place to go with your friends for a pretty good meal.  Last time I tried their frozen dessert (forget the name of it) and it was lovely, a delicate blend of spices that was the perfect finish to the meal.

The pizza is really good here! Good ingredients, lots of cheese and crispy crust. I won't say it's like NY pizza, but it's very tasty in its own way.  Friendly service and charming ambiance, with lots of Frank Sinatra music, and subway-esque signage. Only thing I haven't liked here is the lemonade, it's made from a mix, and the temperature in the restaurant is always freezing.

I have been here many times and the pizza and service are always excellent. I've never been let down. So NYPD has earned 5 stars from me!  They've also updated their menu to offer vegan cheese and salad pizzas. Just as yum as their regular pizzas.   Be aware that it takes about 30 minutes to get your pizza. They don't cut corners here. Get some appetizers if you can't wait that long. Salad is a good choice. I personally don't want the cheesy, doughy apps because, well, the pizza is cheesy and doughy. But my dining companion loves those cheesy garlic knots with either marinara sauce or ranch dressing.

Location, location, location = atmosphere, atmosphere atmosphere! The farm setting is the best thing about The Farm at South Mountain. I would come here every day and hang out for hours if I could.  The food is seriously good too. So fresh, flavorful and delicious with local organic ingredients, often fresh-picked on the premises whenever possible. I've had breakfast at the morning glory cafe with fresh eggs and vegetables gathered from the farm, and I had a picnic lunch from the take-out window, a juicy portobello mushroom sandwich with marinated garden tomato. Seriously the first time in Arizona that I enjoyed the tomato, cause I'm so spoiled for garden heirloom tomatoes, and usually you get served tasteless, mushy supermarket varieties.  You can take a stroll around the grounds before or after lunch, browse the cute shops with locally-hand-made goods, foods and crafts, cluck at the chickens and ducks even take home fresh eggs, veggies and plants for your own garden.  The overall atmosphere creates an experience that is memorable and beautiful, a special treat to remind us of a simple and good way of life.

I love the food here. Fresh, flavorful, organic and seasoned with lots of herbs. Lots of vegetarian and vegan choices. Fresh pressed juices and teas. Everything is well-balanced and prepared with loving care.  Be sure to check the menu for the daily specials--it is sure to be good.

Food is excellent but the service is always slow, and the Ladies Room needs repair. That keeps it from being worth the steep prices. It's a good place for lunch as it is less costly then.   I recommend spanikopita, purple shoots, spicy chicken salad, fresh juice and fragrant tea. Needs work but still my favorite place for the most flavorful, healthy and organic meal in a cute setting.

I'd recommend this art supply store for professional fine artists and graphic artists, but NOT for occasional dabblers/hobbyists/crafters. The supplies they stock are high-quality, professional artist-grade materials, i.e. EXPENSIVE for the most part.  If you are not absolutely sure of what you want and just want to try something out, DON'T come here because you might inadvertently spend a fortune. This is NOT the place to buy student-grade (lower-quality) art supplies.  But if you are a serious artist, and have a good idea of what you need, you will likely find exactly what you are looking for.   If you need advice on materials, the staff is very helpful. Once I brought in a tiny stub of charcoal that was the only one in my art kit that just felt right and made the most beautiful marks. This sweet young lady tested it for me and pronounced it a "6B" grade of charcoal and found some more for me. Now I'm happy because I have a whole stash of 6B charcoal sticks.  Excellent selection of various graphite pencils and charcoals that are priced lower than the hobby/craft stores.  This is the best art supply store in Phoenix, however if you are in the East Valley there are a couple of good stores also.  10-20% Discounts for students, teachers and AZ Artist Guild members.  TIP: Ask to see the kneaded eraser sculptures at the cash register.

As all previous reviewers have said, these guys are AWESOME. Outstanding service. The service tech actually came out to the parking lot with his clipboard to greet me as soon as I drove in.  In and out in less than an hour. Take a little walk to the nearby Barnes & Noble to browse a little while, and it's all done.  They also do free tire checks and will maintain the air pressure for you. Very courteous, friendly and hardworking people. They earn their five star rating for sure!

Interesting, I called AAA to complain about the fact that my roadside assistance never showed up, nor did anyone from AAA contact me to update me on status. Thus leaving me stranded in the dark alone.  I called AAA days later to find out what happened and it seems like my request for roadside assistance never got put through to the tow company.  I requested an email address to write a letter of complaint, and the customer service rep said she didn't have one, she had to ask her supervisor but the supervisor is "busy". Therefore I can't write a letter of complaint.   AAA, this is an insulting way to treat your members. Every ethical company has a way for customers to communicate with them in writing and they are transparent about that.  Now I see on Yelp that reps from AAA offer an email address to those who write poor reviews.   I give them 2 stars because I have received good service in the past but dealing with them this time was a real disappointment. Shame on AAA for giving their paying members this runaround nonsense!

This small contemporary art museum has only 3 galleries, but the exhibits are usually interesting. James Turrell's Knight Rise sky space is a permanent exhibit, and that is a cool, meditative space. Sometimes they have film screenings, and the Spring and Fall openings are fun to attend and wonderful people-watching. There are often docent-led tours which are really helpful and insightful, too. Check the website to find out about these events.  There is also a gallery in the Performing Arts Center next door, that I think is devoted to student artwork. I also like the gift shop. And the Scottsdale Civic Center Park that it is situated in, with the green lawns, LOVE sculpture and many fountains is a nice place to visit too.   If you enjoy modern art and design, it's worth checking out. This museum is free on Thursdays.

I like Lux because it is good for studying or socializing, there are lots of nooks and crannies to hang out in, they have real food as well as pastries, and a bar as well as coffee and tea. They offer almond milk and make good chai. Good people-watching. They score cool points for being open on Christmas and having a Christmas dinner there. I love that. I am a little disturbed that the pastries aren't covered in a glass case, and it is more expensive than other cafes, but I just love that there are alternatives to Starbucks, so I will support them.

I'm not comparing this garden to those in Japan or San Francisco. I'm putting it in its  context which is Phoenix, AZ, a city in the arid desert-not exactly the climate for Japanese landscaping- and less than 1% of the population is Japanese. To yelpers who complain that this garden isn't as good as others they have visited: Why would you think the biggest or best Japanese garden would be here? It's an unfair comparison.  This is a small garden and yes, you "can" go through it in 10 minutes. But if you do that, you are missing the point entirely. This is not Disneyland where you are trying to cram as many thrilling experiences into your day as you possibly can. It's a Japanese garden, which is intended to be a symbolic, harmonious microcosm of nature within a small space, used for contemplation, meditation and admiring beauty at a relaxed pace.  Sometimes people need to zen out and remember what a stream sounds like, or connect with nature and animals by feeding fish. These simple pleasures can make you feel relaxed and happier.  We are lucky to have this beautiful garden, right in the middle of downtown Phoenix.

This is a pretty good market, and it has most of the stuff I like. The organic produce section is pretty sad, but I think that's because it's Phoenix. There are often good sales on things like bulk foods, frozen foods and vitamins, and that's when I stock up. The staff are hard-working and friendly. You can return things (with receipt) if you don't like them, and there is never any hassle.  You can get a deli sandwich here for $2.99!

I shop at the Glendale and 35th Ave. store for produce only. The store is fairly new so it is large and clean, with a festive ambiance (very loud music, and the occasional dancing clowns). The produce is fresh and the prices are fantastic.  You can find things here that you can't get elsewhere, like Mexican papaya, every kind of chili pepper you can imagine, nopales cactus pads and other exotic items.   On Weds and Thurs there are amazing sales and so the store gets quite crowded, so go early if you can. And be prepared to wait for awhile to check out.   They also have a bakery, they make tortillas in-house and they have a salsa bar and a lunch counter with Mexican food that I haven't tried, but smells very good.  Different locations may have different quality of produce. I went to the location on Thomas and found great papayas but green bananas, then that same day I went to the one on Glendale and 35th Ave and found ripe bananas but bruised, past-their-prime  papayas.  I would not buy meat or fish here or anything else for that matter. Just produce. Be aware, it's all non-organic.  Better produce and way more charming than any other supermarket.

I love Jerry's Artarama. It's a dimly-lit, cavernous, warehouse-like space filled with just about everything an artist's heart desires, at super competitive prices. Professional and student grade art supplies.  Fantastic selection of papers, the best I have seen in Arizona.  I always manage to fill up my cart when I come here.  Unfortunately for me it's too far for me to come here regularly, but it's a great resource for East Valley artists.

This little tea house and herb shop is a healing oasis of healthful, hippie goodness.   Lots of teas, tonics and elixirs to choose from. Food is vegetarian, mostly raw, vegan and organic. Super pure and fresh, great flavors. They will work around your dietary restrictions. Wonderful scents from the tea and herb shop. Yummy chocolates.   Yes, the service is slow, this is *not* fast food, take-out or Starbucks! It is a place to slow down, relax and enjoy your meal or tea. Whenever I come here, I leave totally refreshed and revitalized.   Open only for tea time, not for dinner.

If you are like me, and honestly get seriously depressed by the seemingly endless landscape of soul-less chain stores, mega-malls and Wal-Marts that is Phoenix....  Practical Art is the antidote! My arty, indie, beauty-craving spirit comes alive again, just walking in, seeing this lovely shop filled with tasteful, quality, 100% HANDMADE arts and crafts, all made by local artists right here in Arizona!  I need to take time to look at every single object here. I'm smiling as I think of the quirky items (bee shelters, anyone?) and naturally gorgeous specimens (hollowed mesquite bowls that look like they would be at home in a museum). Practical Art gives me newfound appreciation for the talented artists of Arizona. The shop is beautifully curated by proprietors who have a great eye for design, color and style.   Prices range from under $10 to several hundreds. And like the name says, it's "practical art" meaning that you can use it in your home. Useful goods for your kitchen, office, or garden, wearable jewelry art and textiles. Many will last for a lifetime or even longer, if properly cared for.  This shop also doubles as an art gallery, with a rotating exhibit of local artists. I was lucky to catch the last day of a beautiful show by photographer Patrick Madigan. They have art openings on First Fridays.  This is a friendly place, no snooty attitude here, and no pushy salespeople. The owners are obviously passionate about supporting local artists and enjoy sharing their knowledge. They might offer you some tea or lemonade while you look around. It even smells good in here.  From now on, this will be my go-to place to shop for cool, one-of-a-kind gifts for special people.  Please support local artists, buy quality handmade goods, and keep money in our local economy!

This is a chain restaurant so you wouldn't expect the food to be good, but it is.   I like the chopped salad with fresh herbs. I also like their soups, and the roasted sweet potato sandwich. You can get the Wildflower Two combo of soup, petite salad or half sandwich, perfect for lunch. Their bread is great quality, always fresh. Nothing is overly salted or greasy or bland the way you expect at a chain restaurant. It tastes like someone put serious thought and care into putting the recipes together, and is maintaining standards in every kitchen.  I really appreciate that they use antibiotic and hormone-free chicken and pork. They also have quite a few vegetarian options.   Atmosphere is kind of generic but it is a chain. Wildflower is miles ahead of Paradise Bakery in flavor and food quality. Safe place for a good meal and the price is nice.

Hob Nobs is super cute in a little old house like a fairy tale grandmother would live in. It looks out of place on McDowell Road in Phoenix, but I'm glad there is such a charming place here.   There are many rooms to sit in, a couple comfy couches and chairs, an outdoor patio, art by locals to look at, board games to play and books to read. They have a kitchen and serve real food as well as pastries and sweets and they also serve alcohol - beer, wine and hard alcohol.  The parking lot is behind the building and basically has about 6 spaces, so you might have to park a little ways away and (heaven forbid!) actually walk!  They have live music on some nights and depending on who is playing, it could be amazingly good or horrendously awful. The volume is such that it will affect your decision to stay or go.  The food is decent, with a few veggie options - salad, sandwiches, pizzas. Overall a good place with lots of charm and a good vibe.

If you're vegetarian or vegan because you like eating vegetables, unfortunately this is not the place for you. This place offers "mock meat" with very few veggies. Some things, like the Hawaiian burger, are good. But I don't feel very good after a meal without fresh veggies or fruit.  I do enjoy the drinks, though (Pink Lady has rose petals on top!), and I also like watching the other diners laughing at the cult-TV channel.

I love it for the ambiance, big windows, tea (Numi organic) with free refills, giant cookies, quiche, couches and art books. A lovely space with a chill vibe perfect for studying or socializing. Just around the corner is the Japanese Friendship Garden, a beautiful place.

This is my favorite bookstore. I used to go to the ones in Berkeley, CA. This one is awesome too. Lots of gently used and many brand new books too. Also music, DVD's, stationary, cards, gifts and random gadgets. Well-lit, good for browsing, nicely organized and clean, no musty odor. Free coffee, a few chairs, nice people working there.   You can get cash or credit for your used books. Sign up for the email list for info on sales so you can get even less than half price.   Clearance section has neat vintage hardcover books, bags of magazines and stock photo catalogs that are great for collage or decoupage projects, and I scored a beautiful Georgia O'Keefe coffee table book for $2. I like the craft and cookbook areas and the art and design section too of course. They also have collectibles like antique reproduction signs, comics and first edition leatherbound books.  Good for artists: nice selection of art instruction books.  Stock changes often enough that it's always a fresh experience.

I'm so glad I discovered this place. In the land of chain restaurants, this is an adorable local eatery with a focus on fresh, healthy and flavorful wraps and salads.  As a (mostly) vegetarian, I rejoice that every menu offering can be made veggie, by substituting tofu for meat. And I appreciate that the guy at the counter didn't roll his eyes when I explained my dietary restrictions, but was instead super helpful and made great recommendations.  Everything I've had here is delicious and tastes homemade. And I love that they have Reed's Ginger Ale and unsweetened teas.  What a relief from the greasy, salty, meat-focused, chain restaurant food that is the standard fare in Phoenix.  And they will give you a card for a free wrap or salad after you've bought a few meals there.  There is a cute shaded patio for when the weather is nice, and the staff are very friendly and nice, too.  And, extra points for recycling and using compostable utensils!

Suzanne offers a lot more than just bodywork. She also offers hypnotherapy, guided meditations, coaching, aromatherapy and other services. She has a website and radio show about personal and spiritual growth. She is a very warm and sweet-natured person who uses her intuitive gifts and wisdom to help you in the right direction.

WOW this place is one of the coolest time warps around! I can't believe I never knew about it!  As Norm R. said, this is part of William Bartlett's ranch dating back to 1886 with many original restored structures, some are brick and wood and one is stucco, and they all have that wonderful weathered old look to them that just makes you wonder "if these walls could speak, what stories would they tell?"   You can peek inside the buildings and see the furniture, tools and stuff they used during the pioneer days and get a sense of what life was like in Old West Arizona.   You can also wander around the property and look at and even touch (but no climbing please!) lots of cool rusty old farm machinery, wagons and equipment, and wonder about what it was used for.   I also saw: a blacksmith shop, a reproduction of a well building that would have been used in the 1920's, something that looked like a locomotive engine, a dairy barn, a cornfield, a citrus orchard, grapevines, a rose garden, peacocks, rooster chasing a hen, the cutest white bunny I've ever seen in my life, and 7 beautiful princesses in ball gowns and tiaras posing for quincenera pictures.  All around the property are educational signs with info and photos about the original ranch and what life was like from the 1890's thru the 1930's (when the ranch was at the peak of production).  I didn't get a chance to take a tour, but I think that would be an excellent idea! The website says that tours are held Thursdays thru Saturdays, 10 AM - 2 PM, and Sundays 1 - 4 PM.  I saw a sign that says you can even rent parts of the property for special events. (I gotta save up for a major shindig now!)  It's the perfect spot for an afternoon stroll when it isn't unbearably hot, and there are tons of park benches where you can just rest and relax. If you have kids they will be super happy to see all the cool stuff and run around after the peacocks. Just don't let them climb all over everything or lose them in the cornfield, and you'll be good.   So, so glad this wonderful slice of Glendale's history has been preserved.  And admission is FREE!

Clean organic, vegan, raw fresh food and juices, in a quiet cafe setting.  I've been here only once and had the California Salad. It comes with a couple small pieces of onion bread, which is actually a raw dehydrated cracker, not the soft spongy stuff you usually think of when you hear the word "bread". The bread has basil walnut pesto on it which is called "pate" on the menu (a bit confusing).   The salad and entree seem to be essentially the same thing except the entree has more onion bread and costs a couple more bucks.  The salad is a delicious medley of fresh, flavorful organic greens, cranberries, walnuts and seeds tossed in a homemade dressing that is sweet and tangy. I like the onion bread and pesto it comes with - you gotta like garlic, though, and I do. The portion size is huge. I think it would be nice for two people to share a salad and raw dish for a light but nourishing lunch.  They also have desserts like mud pie, carrot cake and cheesecake.  It's a nice relaxed cafe atmosphere with lovely dish ware, dark colors in the dining room, and big cushioned chairs. The ambiance transcends its strip mall setting. The staff is friendly but the place is a little too quiet. On a weekday at noon I was the only diner there for most of my lunch, and the most prominent sound was the hum of a refrigerator. Then someone put on some music, very quiet.   I would like to come back and try some of the raw specialties but I'm not sure I will get to them, seeing as how the salad is so good. They also have fresh pressed juices here.   There's a sign out front saying that they have classes on juicing and nutrition. The staff members told me they were on a juice fast, when I went there. But it's a little weird to be told how much better it is to juice, while you're eating a meal at a restaurant.   You don't get tap water here, you get a plastic bottle of "spring water"  - I'd like the option to just have filtered water without the plastic, though.  A little spendy for a salad but it's organic, fresh and delicious, and that's extremely rare in Phoenix. Good food can be medicinal and Organic Shores fits that category.

Clean and veggie-safe (no lard, broth or animal products in the tortillas, rice or beans), delicious, filling and in a fun environment!   The burrito is huge. I cut mine in half and save it for 2 meals. After eating half a burrito for lunch, I don't even want to eat dinner, I am that full! At less than $6 for a veggie burrito, that's insanely cheap. Tacos are good too.  The owner is a mom who loves to cook, so everything tastes fresh and homemade. I love that I can choose from different types of tortillas (tomato, spinach, whole wheat) and beans (black or pinto). If you like meat they have many different varieties with different seasonings and you can sample them all before you order. They have horchata and Mexican sodas. If they had aguas frescas I'd give them five stars!  Loud music, bright colors and fun Lucha Libre wrestling theme with masked costumes mannequins and photos of wrestlers everywhere.  I also like the hand-washing station outside the bathrooms for easy clean-up, and salsa bar. Mmm, love the green salsas!
