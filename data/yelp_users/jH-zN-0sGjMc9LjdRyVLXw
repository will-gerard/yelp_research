This place is a gem. Best bagels you can get in AZ and their crumb coffee cake - I'm pretty sure I gain weight every time I look at it.   Very friendly and quick service!

The Applebee's of seafood with all the ambiance of a Costco. Waitress was friendly. Lobster was a little overcooked. Our appetizer came late so they gave it to us for free. I can't complain.

The hole-in-the-wall restaurants that I frequent would think this place is small and dirty. That being said, their enchilada sauce has a nuttiness that takes work. And it must have been a labor of love cause the green burro enchilada style is definitely made with love.   They aren't set up for a lot of people so if your party is more than 4 people, you don't like weird smells, or don't enjoy Mexican television then plan on taking it to go.

This is the ONLY pizza place in Tempe as far as I'm concerned. Great crust, sauce and cheese. They do skimp on the toppings but they serve Frank's hot sauce. So that is a huge plus. I freggin' love that stuff.

Pro tip: order the Greek with half marinara, half olive oil, no olives, with pineapple, and extra crispy crust (it makes picking it up manageable).   Not only is it delicious but ordering it is a real panty dropper.   I'm not sure that I would call this pizza. Don't get me wrong, it's wildly good. But if I'm craving pizza I'm going to Otto's on Ash. But whatever this is- it's amazing.

This is the kind of place that reminds you that you've been eating in hole in the wall restaurants. This place reminds you that you're poor. But it reminds you that you're poor with a fine cheese plate and food that you could never make for yourself.    The food is really 4+ stars but the service is hit and miss.

I've tried 3 times to make it in time for their lunch specials and its been sold out every time. I'll keep trying because the market is worth the visit itself. It has the cheapest ingredients for sushi (rice vinegar, seaweed paper, soy sauce) and it has sushi grade fish. BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. They carry black sesame ice cream. Black sesame ice cream is my jam.

Super fast friendly service.   Great hot sauce.  The bean burrito is REALLY good. It's almost like dessert.   The fish tacos are pretty good too.  What else do you need?

I've wanted to come here since I was a child in the back seat of my parents' car driving between Phoenix and San Diego. My parents aren't the adventurous type. Anyway I went into the diner with low expectations. It's a pit stop in a small town with a kitschy theme- it doesn't need to be good. BUT! It wasn't bad. Onion rings were decent, apple pie was fresh - and it wasn't CRAZY expensive. Not many options for a pescetarian though.

Even things that sound like they won't be good - actually turn out to be great. The food is uncommonly good.   THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS PLACE IS: the waiters have no uniform and they all dress like hipsters. You can't tell who is bringing your drinks and who is just a bassist in an alt-rock band.

This place. This place. Ohh this place. This place is an anomaly as far as restaurants go. Fresh innovative vegetarian cooking. And the service is extremely friendly. The food is reasonably priced but they have so many good things it's easy to spend a lot.

If you wish your soup tasted more like the Pacific Ocean then this place is for you. More sweat tasting liquid than you've ever hoped for.

Giving you macaroni salad with every order is such a Polynesian power move. It's genius AND delicious.   Leo's is about $8/person but they give you two meals worth of food. Brilliant and sauces galore. That's all I want in life.

Healthy, fast, breakfast food. Not sure why this is such a novel idea.    So scrumptious- I crave it even when I'm not in a big hurry. Their breakfast burritos are great. So good that I don't think I've ever ordered anything else. I need to branch out.

I love this place. They have a great salmon blt that I get without the 'b'. Their waffle fries are killer - they'll do a mushroom cap burger that is REALLY good. Annnd bruschetta is really good there.   Good service and good food. Nothing to dislike.

In a city shrouded in the darkness of a lack of authentic Mexican food Los Reyes de la Torta is a beacon of light, hope and free freshly made chips.   It's big and clean - great place for families. It's kind of unique because places this good and authentic are usually dirty little hole-in-the-wall-shopping-plaza-restaurants. But this place is in a free standing building with plenty of seating and booths!   They have free chips and salsa. It's spicy salsa too. Clearly not made for white people. Also, my family were the only white people in there at the time. So ya know it's good.   Service was great. Plenty of parking. Oh and the menu is HUGE. it's kind of overwhelming but they have vegetarian and fish options, so it's a great place for pescatarians.

Stupendous place with genuinely good, healthy food. I love sitting outside - it's got a good backyard feel.   You can't go wrong with a protein bowl and you have to splurge on one of their fresh pressed juices at least once.   *they're only busy on weekdays at lunch but the line moves pretty fast.

This is the Zooey Deschanel of food. It's cute but dry and ultimately unfulfilling.   I went in with some friends around 9pm. We shared a carrot cake, chocolate cake, 2 macaroons, and a fruit tart (the cakes are tiny and precious). 9 is a little late for a bakery but they're open until midnight. And a carrot cake doesn't get that dry after 12 hours. That cake was 3 or 4 days dry. Macaroon was chewy. Chocolate cake was good but it was actually white cake with chocolate ganache.   Anyway, service was a bunch of teenagers who were more interested in each other. They were fine. We didn't have any problems with them.   If you're still trying to impress someone, take your date elsewhere.

This place is on par with airport restaurants. They know you can't really go anywhere else so there is no hurry to serve you and the food doesn't have to be affordable because you only eat there when you really have to. Consequently, I only eat here when I really have to.

They'll charge you $40 if you are late (as stipulated in the intake form) but don't care to keep an appointment themselves.    It's easy to find and has plenty of parking. The staff are all very pleasant but their thoughtlessness is infuriating. I had an appointment at 3. I took time out of my busy day to be there on time and they seated me in the lobby. I waited an hour before asking when I would be seen. The staff told me they didn't know. They had two emergencies come in before us. I understand that happens but why wouldn't you call and let me know? Or at very least let me know once I arrived? The dentist wasn't the focus of my day and it's frustrating how casually they disrespected my time.  The staff said I could come back tomorrow. Why should I make a second appointment when they can't keep the first? There are thousands of dentists in this town. I can easily go to someone else. You should definitely look elsewhere.
