One of my friends took me here after raving about their parent's passion for this place and how they have been going here year after year.  Oh my god!  This place is sooooo amazing!  The owner is so sweet as well.  It's authentic, delicious, and really reasonably priced, too.  If you even think your left overs will make it to your house (or even the 101) think again.  This place is just plain awesome!

I've been searching the valley for three years now to find some amazing mexican that tastes like home.  After Bisteces turned Cuban, I was certain Fiesta Burrito in South Scottsdale was the best the valley could do (still go there).  I was wrong.  This place is an old Taco Bell (+ 3pts right there), they take cash only, and you won't even need a lot of it!  The tacos are huge, the cheese is not cheddar, the green sauce is perfect, the carne asade doesn't have any suspicious chunks, and their beans are even amazing!  It's a hidden gem that hits the spot every time; if you're from California, you'll definitely appreciate it.

Wow, another gem in Scottsdale!  The food does take a while to arrive, but that is only because you are getting the freshest and best of what you could have ordered.  The atmosphere was great when I visited, a large group of people dining in the middle, laughing, and having fun, just what you'd expect from an Italian place, right?  The place smells devine, too.   So then there's the food...amazing!  Their breads are awesome, the sandwiches are nothing short of amazing.  You'll be back within a couple of days, if you can even hold out that long.

Oh my god how can anyone live in north Scottsdale and miss this gem for so long!?! Everything is fresh, the combinations are quirky, and work amazingly, plus the service is excellent.  The owners were there when I was, and were quick to help a n00b decide.  Everything we had was great.  They were sampling orange-white chocolate cookies as well, which were dangerously delicious.  Order the whole sandwich, you will eat it all.  I look forward to exploring this menu further in the not too distant future.

If you're looking for authentic, keep driving.  I've never had anything here that remotely wowed me, and I've tried their chain several times.  I should have realized this was going to happen too, when everyone who recommended it thought Filliberto's is good.  Just because you see the red and green sauces in the little plastic ketchup bottles that remind you of your last trip to San Diego doesn't mean it's authentic.  It's good for white suburbanites, I'll give them that much, but then again, so is San Diego.  One word: gringo.

I must have a hard time reviewing places that are less than five-stars, so here is another hidden gem of the valley!   This place is another hole-in-the-wall establishment brought my way via Yelp. The torta el pastor was phonomenal! They have a huge salsa bar with this green concoxion that looks like it would be avacado something, but it's totally spicy as wasabi.  I dream of stuff this spicy: I completely drowned my torta in this.  My friend and I were the only people here minus a younger couple behind the counter, and an elderly couple who made the food.  My friend who came with and was as blown away as I was.  Such a great little establishment in close proximity to downtown; I'll be back.

The service is great, and the pho lives up to the name.  The prices are great, and the service is good too.  The location is great too, if you're not too full stop by the bakery next door, they're great too.

Left a tip but it just didn't do justice. There is nothing wrong with paying for parking or getting in but this event was a complete joke. I get it, 25 food trucks is a feat for the late-to-catch-on Phoenix...culture? But who in their right minds sells so many tickets for so few trucks. Over a year ago I was in Arcadia, CA at a similar event with a solid hundred trucks of not more. I have to agree, the promoters were just in it for the money. It was a complete fail. They seem to have a lot of good ideas for events at the Salt River fields but every time I go to an event there, it falls short of expectations. Was it the food trucks fault? Not at all! There are a few good trucks here, just follow them on Facebook, Twitter still hasn't caught on out here.

This is what yelp is all about; finding gems like these! The staff is amazingly nice, the coffee is delish and the chocolate is completely sinful. Kind of hidden north of a preschool off of 51st ave.
