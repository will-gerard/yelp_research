Japanese cuisine is one of my favorites, so I was quite geeked that this place was on my side of town. It came recommended by a few co-workers, as they frequent the joint often. However for me, I will be "waving bye" as I frequently drive past Blue Fin.  The menu has some of my favorite common Japanese dishes (Teriyaki Chicken, Tonkatsu, etc.). I decided to roll with the White Chicken Katsu (Panko Breaded Chicken) and some Shrimp Tempura - relatively common, easy to make, usually tasty Japanese dishes. Well, I did not know they would use Arizona sand as the breading. The chicken was so over cooked and bland that it dried my mouth. Luckily there was enough grease to squeeze into my mouth from the Shrimp Tempura to combat the dryness.   The saving grace for Blue Fin are the portions and price point. One can chow down for a small price, but you will be sacrificing quality. Be sure to ask for extra water if ordering anything breaded!

Ahhh yes! Nellos the unofficial pizza joint of Tukee. Totally worth spending the extra few dollars to get a pie here as opposed to one of those chain "pizza" joints. The service here is always friendly and the food is obviously delicious. Be sure to stop by for the deliciousness!

This little hidden gem in Tukee serves up an A+ pie. It is somewhat small on the inside, so there is a bit of a wait on the weekend even for a party of two. The waitresses are always on top of things and provide A+ service.  We always order the BBQ Chicken za and it definitely deserves an A+! It always comes fresh and cooked perfectly. I am weird and like the crust edges to be a tad burnt, but not tooooo much. Mmm. Burnt edges. The tangy capers in the pizza add a flavor that compliments the sweeter BBQ chicken. They do offer other Italian menu choices, but the za is too good to not get.   It is nice having two places in Ahwatukee that are worth going to in the same complex (Angry Crab). If you are ever in the area and have a craving for a solid pie, this place receives a passing grade.

I had not been here since my college days and had forgotten that Ted's serves up the best onion rings in town! The rings come highly recommended with any order. We came (party of 2) on a Friday night and there was pretty much no wait. The smell of the charbroiled hot dogs definitely brought back some salivating memories. My go to is always the Classic White Hot Dog with sauerkraut, onions, mustard, and a pickle spear - pretty darn tasty. They do offer burgers, but I can never deviate from that delicious wiener in my mouth.  The service here is always quick considering they cook the food in front of you. Remember to get the rings - you will not be disappointed!

We came here on a late Friday night (party of two) and were expecting a wait. However, it seemed the rare rainy Arizona weather had scared everyone off and we were seated right away. If you decide to sit on the patio, they have heat lamps for those "chilly" Arizona nights. The hostess and the waitress (MJ) throughout the night were both very friendly and accommodating.  This is easily one of my favorite brew houses in the Phoenix Metro area. The Kiltlifter and the Pumpkin Porter (when available) are my choice of poison. They offer pretty cheap beer flights to sample all their varying beers on tap, which are all good in their own unique way.  Unlike most breweries the food here is delicious! The Continental Divide burger with pork belly confit and a runny over easy egg was a flavor profile of excellence that I honestly was not expecting. Coupled with a handful of beer battered fries and Kiltlifters, I left this place full and happy. We definitely will be coming back soon!

Taco Tuesdays! Nom. Really good deals on their Monster Tacos (three bucks per), cervezas and tequila drinks. They also had other taco options that were also good deals. We ordered (party of two) a total of four chicken-chorizo Monster Tacos. They were a good deal for their price point, but be sure to add a side of sour cream, quac and/or salsa as the tacos are bland AF.  Why the two stars for Dos Gringos? The service there is sslllloooowww. ¡Es muy lento! From the time we arrived and were acknowledged to the random table check ups, the service was sslllloooowww. Our waitress even forgot to bring back our card after charging it, leaving us to hunt for her after ten minutes. Apparently it got "too busy" for her although there was only one other table of eight aside from us. Yikes. Best of luck on the assumably busier weekend shift.

Chicken. Fried. Steak. Do it. Only a few places in AZ do this dish right and Charleston's definitely is one of them. Coupled with delectable red potato mash and grilled candied carrots, the portion size is more than generous. I like to get the dish with a side of fried okra for a taste of southern goodness. The chicken fried steak is literally the only thing I get here, but I am sure the rest of the menu is as tasty.   Service here is also pretty delectable. The grub buddy and I never have to wait for a table and are always greeted with a smile. The waiting staff is always on fleek with drink service and always make sure we are good. Decoratively speaking it reminds me of my grandma's 80's dining room. This is okay because it actually fits the clientele.  Remember - chicken fried steak. Try it and be satisfied.

Ooohhh how exciting! The "new" Red Robin - new look, new technology, new attitude. We were seated in the bar area, and let's just say the table setting is VERY intimate. But hey, the setting might be okay since you are in "holding-hands distance" with your neighbor to embrace each other while you embark on a horrible burger adventure.   The first red flag was when we ordered and the server did not ask how we wanted our burger cooked. A "gourmet" burger place that doesn't ask what temperature you would like your burger? Word? Apparently the "new" Red Robin's patty is something similar to what you would find at McDonalds.  It seemed there was only one person working the bar area on a Friday night. This made for 10 minute beer service and 15 minute water service. I guess the "new" Red Robin calls for less servers.  Seemingly the new corporate rebranding has changed the food and service. Bring back "old" Red Robin!

The family and I (party of 7) decided to come here New Years Eve to stuff ourselves before the big ball drop. From the mountain of endless crab legs, to the savagely delicious lamb shanks, this buffet is worth the price of admission.   This buffet is better than most Las Vegas buffets. Yes, I said it. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more at this buffet than your typical cardboard-tasting Chinese buffet - you won't regret it.

I don't normally review chains, but this specific experience at Cinco Hombres was amazing. The fresh burger and fries were on point despite the 30-minute wait time. Yes, 30-minutes, but this was due to the fact that ASU was embarrassing themselves down the street in the Cactus Bowl. This hands down is the best Five Guys in Phoenix.

This. Place. Is. Solid. We came here during the middle of the downtown lunch rush hour with a party of 13 and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. Given the amount of people in our party, the waiters did an excellent job. The servers were polite, prompt and knowledgable of the menu. It is nice coming to place where your menu questions are answered without an eye roll and with confidence.  We started with the Pretzel Bun and Fried Shrimp with Jalapeño appetizers. These were amazing. The breading on the fried stuff was seasoned nicely and the Pretzel Buns coupled by the cheese sauce were simply irresistible.  I ordered the Cubano sammich and of course it was delicious. The amount of smokiness in the pork was a punch to the mouth but in a good way. Normally I don't like going back to work in a borderline food-comatose state, but this place was too good to not channel my inner fatty.

My favorite time of year... Spring Training! Decided to come out for the D-Backs and Cubs Spring Training game and am always impressed at how clean and well maintained Salt River Fields is compared to the other parks.  Of course I had to come out and try the infamous Salt River Fields Mega Dog. Mega Dog what? Delicious spicy green chili mac and cheese, topped along with smokey-sweet pulled pork on a 1/2 lb juicy beef hot dog; all between a soft but delicate fresh hot dog bun.  The verdict? Not bad for ballpark food!

The brochacho and I decided to try this place for the Card's playoff game. The brochacho and I decided to also never come back here again. The service was godawful. During the span of a three-hour game, our server checked on our table two times. Yes. Two. Times.  When you initially arrive the first thing you will notice is the sheer amount of security/bouncers working. Why? Because of the transient crowd this bar attracts. Never have I been to a sports bar where fans of the SAME TEAM are fighting each other. If you decide to visit, please be careful as there might be the possibility of flying crack pipes and hypodermic needles.

Saturday night. Mmmmm. Let's pull up Yelp and find a joint to satisfy my BBQ cravings. Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ? Yeah, that sounds delicious. Jump in the car, windows down, good music blasting, yeah I'm ready to go into a food coma. Yum. I can taste it now - succulent brisket, fall-off-the-bone ribs, deliciously-savage sides.   Yes! Pull up to an awesome parking spot and open the car door to the smell of stomach-rumbling BBQ. The restaurant door swings open and wow, it smells even better than outside. Wait in line and grab my huge aluminum tray and say:  "I'll have a pound of the brisket and a pound of ribs please!"  "Sorry sir we're out of brisket and ribs."  ARE. YOU. FREAKING. KIDDING. ME.  Yes, the BBQ place, the place that specializes in BBQ and only that, is out of BBQ. Not only out of BBQ, but out of BBQ at 6:30 PM on a Saturday night. MIND. BLOWING.   If there's one thing I can take away from my experience... they definitely DO STOP SMOKIN' BBQ.

Sauces on fleek! Even the ranch dipping sauce was tasty. I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but the wings were a tad bit on the dry side. Other than that fact, the Honey Habanero and Cajun BBQ sauces were pure deliciousness. We also ordered a side of their French Fries and oh boy were those home-tasty good! All the good food was washed down by some Blue Raspberry Lemonade Kool-Aid. Yup, I said Kool-Aid! They also had Grape and Tropical punch flavors.   We came (party of two) around the time they opened, so the service was fast. The owner also greeted us and was quite friendly. Whenever we do decide to come back, I'll be sure to try the apparently hottest Toxic sauce!

Let's get this right off the bat, Rehab serves up one of the best burgers in AZ. The lean/fat ratio, seasoning, and cook on the burger patty is always on fleek. Your ability to choose what delicious bun is unique. Burger toppings are high quality and unrivaled. On this particular visit I ordered the PB&J Bacon Burger, and was a bit surprised how well the flavors blended together. I also had a bite of my dining partner's Hangover Burger which was also delightful.   That being said, their sides are AWFUL. French fries - so over cooked and bad that I almost broke my sobriety. Sweet potato tots - so soggy and bland that no treatment could help them. Onion rings - enough grease to fill a few shot glasses.  The service was awesome and not your typical Scottsdale vibe. Expect a 5 star burger and service but stay away from the other menu items.

Huge selection of beers on tap and even bottled. The only caveat is they might not have some of the on tap stuff. What do I mean?  Me: May I have the Dogfish Head brew?  BT: Sorry, we currently don't have that one.  Me: Okayyy... How about the Four Peaks beer?  BT: Yeah, we don't have that one either. We had a tasting event earlier and don't have those.  Good times. There are plenty of other places on Mill and Tempe with large beer selections that actually have inventory. Proceed to this place with caution!

I am usually skeptical of places that feature "Asian fusion," but Pacific Gardens did not disappoint! There were only a few tables seated for lunch on a marvelous Ahwatukee Saturday, but nevertheless the service was outstanding. The waiter (Ken) made sure we were ok and that our beverages were topped off. I find most decor at Asian restaurants to be tacky, but this place was appropriately furnished; definitely an upgrade from the old Abacus Inn.  The lunch menu comes with soup, a delectable ginger-dressing salad, rice, and choice of entree. Mongolian beef was the dish I chose, and it was quite tasty! It could have been a tad spicier, but rectifiable by asking for more peppers. I managed to steal a couple bites of sweet and sour chicken from my dining partner's plate/tray, and that was also delicious! Even though it was lunch time, I must say the portions were pretty generous.   We will definitely be coming back to try the sushi and dinner menu. Who knows, maybe I will try their spicy-sushi-bonsai challenge next time!

Greetings everyone - I write this review from the afterlife as I have died and gone to Burger Heaven. We came during lunch hour, so the wait was not very long. The experience and food at BurGR were absolutely worth the visit. Our server was extremely helpful with picking a burger that satisfied our pallets and a perfect cold beer to wash it down.   We started off the meal with some of the Jalapeño Poppers and of course they were delicious. The creaminess of the ranch sauce complimented the spiciness of the peppers quite well.  The burger was cooked (ordered a medium rare) and seasoned to perfection. We also ordered fries and they were fried and seasoned perfectly. I always find myself adding more salt to my fries, but not here!  The difference in the quality of ingredients compared to your "regular" gourmet burger joint is night and day. Granted, BurGR is a tad bit more pricier than those said joints, but the service and food is unrivaled. We will definitely be returning here next time we visit Vegas!

I love coming to this place on Sundays for football! The specials are pretty good and Zipparitas will have you buzzing (limit of 3 is completely understandable). The waitresses are always on fleek and the food is above average for bar food. My personal go to are the Golden Medium wings with an ice-cold Blue Moon. Definitely one of the better sports bars in the Ahwatukee area!

A place to bring my four legged friend! The unique dog themed decor was something I seriously loved. From the bone shaped tables, to the pictures of furry companions, there was something about this place that felt very homey.  I could keep raving about the decor, but they also brew up some bitchin' beer! Of course I had to try and lick up all the different ones so I ordered a flight. You get to choose up to five different breeds, but the Peanut Butter Cup Porter made me tear off my muzzle! It honestly tasted like liquid Reese's Pieces and would have even made Pavlov drool.  The beer here comes highly recommended, but don't forget to bring your ankle biters!

Simply put, this place is awesome! From the outstanding service, to the classy-unique decor, and of course the tasty Italian Ice, Joe's is a place I could see myself frequenting in the summer. The young gentleman at the counter gave us samples which were all tasty in their own right, but we (party of two) decided to share a large Raspberry Italian Ice. Be sure to try it Joe Latti style, as it provided a perfect balance of cream sweetness to the tartness of the raspberry.  I fully expect my stamp card to be fully punched and redeemed by the end of the summer!

An impromptu Vegas trip brought me to this marvelous place of brunch goodness. With island staples of Loko Moko and various Kalua Pig dishes on the menu, this little hole in the wall brings tasty Hawaiian dishes with a brunch twist. They also offer "normal American breakfast items" on their menu, but definitely try the Hawaiian fare!  Seemingly the weekends are busy, so be prepared to wait. The actual place is relatively small, so that also contributed to the wait time. My personal wait ended up being around 30 minutes but well worth it. The service was on point, and the time it took for the food to arrive after being seated was waaayyy shorter than the actual wait to be seated.   I will be sure to stop by again when I am hungover and leaving Nevada. Mahalo Babystacks Cafe!

Want a place to get hammered and play video games or watch e-sports that is not at home? Endgame Bar! They have a ton of consoles and retro games to keep anyone busy for a night. Beer selection is not bad and some of the events they host are actually pretty fun. They even have food if you have been gaming/drinking too hard and get hungry!

Hidden in a little strip mall in Tukee, Angry Crab did not disappoint. The unique experience included wearing a bib, eating off a table, and graffiting up some walls. However, the best experience was definitely the food. Our table of two ordered one pound of shrimp, one pound of snow crab legs (both trifecta style and #5 heat) and a basket of fried shrimp with fries; all of which was devoured with much gusto! The #5 heat had a nice kick and comes highly recommended if you like it spicy... The surprise star of the meal were the French fries; I could not stop clawing at them! Cajun seasoning FTW!  The service was also excellent. Our server (Dawn) made sure my water was topped off while I was hastily scarfing down shellfish. I hope more restaurants like Angry Crab scurry into Ahwatukee!
