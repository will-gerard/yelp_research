Horrible place!  I would give 0 stars if I could!!!  Managers are archaic and very unhappy people.   She said I was in their property way past 6 o clock but the only proof she had was a hand written note.  Not the code that we used to get out and would not produce any security footage as proof. They charged me an extra $40 just to get my stuff out.  Use at your own risk and prepare to be extorted!

Fruits and veggies are very fresh.  And seem less expensive then purchasing at the grocery store...  Definitely a fan!!

Really not a fan!!  I just had a gel manicure done there and this chick (I wish I would have gotten her name) literally murdered my cuticles.  Out of 10 fingers, 9 of them had cuts on them... So needless to say, I was less than pleased.  I went back after work and showed them and told them I was unhappy, then the manager said he would have someone redo them.  RIGHT!!! Like you are coming anywhere near me with the acetone!! So then he says he will just take the polish off, and I told him that was unacceptable because again, no one was coming near me with the acetone or someone would get cut with one of the nails tools!  He ultimately refunded the money, but it was a hassle.  And my hands hurt like hell!  On a side note, I am in sales so I understand up selling, but really, EVERYTHING costs more money.  If you want an accent finger, $5 more.  If you want a design, $5 more, and of course French $5 more.  And the end result isn't all that great!  I went to this place because it was close to my job, but I will not ever go back.

So Catherine is awesome!! Yes this salon is in Walmart which a little bit of a drawback.  But I found her purely by chance when a coworker of mine recommended her and have been going back ever since!  She knows what she is doing with your hands and feet and BONUS, she has a personality that you will actually like talking to!!

I think they changed owners recently.  The wings used to be really good, now, they are good, just not AS good.
