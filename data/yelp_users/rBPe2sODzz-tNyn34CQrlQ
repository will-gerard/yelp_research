Great hot plate Mexican food especially for cheese lovers. The relleno is a classic here and my personal favorite is the red burro and enchilada plate. Great comfort food! Margaritas are not to be missed one of the few I can actually drink with out feeling my teeth decaying

If heaps of food at a reasonable price is what your after look no further then chompies. The menu is as gigantic as the sandwiches. While chompies is best described as a NY Jewish deli don't let the thought of liver scare you off !

Great little Thai place with some very authentic Thai items mixed in with some more Americanized dishes for the less adventurous. The menu is big and can be a bit daunting. Service was excellent and the staff was very accommodating even though we stayed well past close.

Smelled like raw sewage in the parking lot. Wasn't greeted as we walked in and had to wander around aimlessly until someone finally saw us even though thr place was empty. To top it all off they were out of the ghost chili which is a key ingredient in their signature dishes. The waitress was slow and unapologetic.

One of our favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area. The chef is originally from new York and you can see her cooking live in the open half kitchen as you walk in. Small venue with exceptional service and the menu changes as items go in and out of season locally. Extremely knowledgable staff that can cater to foodies and novices alike. If your in the mood for wine check out their selection of Arizona wines. Stronghold is a go to for the wine list. The broccoli is not to be missed.

The food used to be great at this spot offering up Irish fare that rivaled the long time favorite Rula Bula. However, it seems that recently they have decided to change their menu (in order to cut food cost it seems) and take the fish n chips dinner ($12) down to only 2 small pieces of fish. The chips also got changed to small thin fries that are too greasy for all but the strongest of stomachs.   So what about the drinks you ask ? Well, the Guinness is great and the atmosphere is not so bad either, atleast until 10pm. After 10pm the college crown rolls in and the glass goes away in favor of plastic cups. Sorry Robbie, I'm not going to drink my whiskey out of a plastic cup. I don't care what time it is.  Save yourself the trouble and go to Rula. Unless your looking to hit on or actually hit some overly drunk college kids.
