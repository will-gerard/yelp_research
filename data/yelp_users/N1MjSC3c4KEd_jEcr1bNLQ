We have been coming here since it opened and we are treated like family each and every time. To have a restaurant that has had the same employees over all of these years tells me something for John the owner. Now for the food they have a large menu and there are several favorites that I keep coming back for. The menudo is a family favorite and I think it is some of the best in the valley and I have been eating menudo for over 40 years. The margaritas are special treat, inexpensive and they taste great. The flavors in the Salpicon salad are craved at least twice a week and is delicious with any of the 3 options: chicken, beef, or shrimp!

Well I new better to come in on a Sunday 45 minutes to be seated, 20 more then we were told, another 45 to get our food plus they never brought the whole meal and no one asked how we were doing. Bottom line it was not worth 2 hours of my life

I don't understand why it takes so long when they are not busy at all this morning, but 45 minutes is not acceptable.http://www.yelp.com/

I have been using Danny Car wash for over 25 years, but this location has some of the Slowest  service in town. I will not go back to this location. It took 45 miniutes for what should of been a 20 miniute job.  What bothered me the most was that only one person was on my car while 4 other workers were in a circle talking. If I was managing this car wash I would try to have my customers in and out fast and have all the employees helping like a pit crew. I did receive a call back from the regional manager that was happy I called, he was going to look into the service level at this location. He invited me in to the Bell Rd location and being very apologetic he offered me a free cash. The thing I like the most is that he cared and tried to make it right. So I may not come to this location, I will continue to use Danny's Carwash at the Bell road location.

I have been eating here since they have been in business. The best Delmonico New York Strip I have ever had. Everywhere I go I try the Delmonico and no one can put a candle to Chef Charles Version. You must thy the Lamb chop appetizer it is out of the world. I love to see this restaurant improve a bit on there service sometimes it is great and other times it is so so. Bottom line this is my favorite place for a steak on the west side.

This was my 2nd time here, the tacos, beans and the quesadilla were great and the margaritas very good as well. This is  one of my new stops while downtown. I love the little house that has been transformed into the fun place to eat. I took 7 people to a quick lunch everyone rave about the experience.

I truly enjoyed this great ambiance and the food was full of flavor. The service was over the top and that was what I expected when I we walked in the door. The staff was very friendly and attentive. If you are looking for a classy place to dine with that special someone or entertain clients this is the place. The only issue was when I tried to check in on Yelp it said I was to far away. LOL

I first visited Blackstone when the course first opened back in 2004. I joined soon after and I must tell you this Country Club is one of the best in the Valley and it has to be one of the friendliest golf clubs that I have every visited. From the many awards this club has won to the outstanding service it is no wonder, why  Blackstone has grown even in a slow economy.  I have been inviting clients and friends from all over and everyone agrees that this is one of the best Golf Clubs that they have the opportunity to experience.

We have been here twice and have enjoyed both the food and the service. Both times we sat at the bar and we treated like a regulars. When we returned for our second visit we we welcomed back, that was a nice feeling. You have to try the skinny margarita, THEY ARE THE BEST! So far everything we have tried is very good and it is worth the drive since we live in Glendale, it is a bit of a trek but well worth it.

I have been to Betty's twice now. We love the location and it just has a good over all feel. If you are dining inside or out it is very comfortable I cant wait till it is cooler so we can sit next to the fireplace. As for the food, it is outstanding and at a fair price. They have assemble a great team here from the chief  to the wine stewart. Looking forward to the soon to be released expanded menu. You have to save room for the bread pudding it is truly amazing

My favorate mexican food restaurant opens its 3 location in Glendale and this one is a hit and with in walking distance from our home. Now we don't have to stop at just two of their award winning Margaritas, simply the best and don't be fooled these margaritas have a kick . I have been eating at the 67th Ave & Bell rd location at least once a week since they opened. I spoke to the owner yesterday and this location is breaking sales records and they have only been open a week. I recently became a vegetarian and I though I was going to have to stop eating Caramba's, but as I looked at the menu I notice that they a vegetarian burro and several other options on the menu. Thank god, I don't know if I could make it with out my weekly fix. If you like menudo that have the best. One of the best things about eating at Caramba's is the friendly people that work there preparing the best and healthiest mexican food in the valley (NO LARD or M.S.G.). When I say fresh, they mean fresh NEVER FROZEN. The salsa bar is stocked with a variety of made fresh daily salsas. I have lived in the valley all my life and I can honestly tell you that you to will love Caramba Fresh Mexican Food.
