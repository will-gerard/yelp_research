One of my fav places that I would recommend to anyone! The atmosphere is intimate and trendy. They have a good wine selection and delicious food. I would recommend the bruschetta which comes in 12 different flavors. The Brie & Apple and the Prosciutto & Figs are the best in my book. The staff is also friendly and helpful. They provided me with some great suggestions on wine after asking a few questions. Overall, it's just a great place to go for any occasion.

This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ! Fresh fish, good portions, and great service. A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce! Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional...but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like. I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta, which is a salmon/yellowtail/tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice.  The staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars. As I wait for a table, I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs. There must be a reason why people constantly come back, right? Check this place out and judge for yourself!

One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had! At $2.50 per slice of sashimi, I expected a lot better than a recently defrosted and grainy slice of tuna. Also, do not get the Lobster Roll...it tastes like shrimp tempura that costs $27.   The service was also bad. The manager knew we had a large party (we made reservations) and assigned a new waitress to handle the table by herself. We got through half of the meal before getting our beers, and it took 30 min (not exaggerating) to get our bill. Would not go back.

I love going to AZ88 to hang out, have a cocktail, and people watch.  AZ88 is tres chic with changing art displays and live dj. I especially enjoy sitting on the patio decked out with modern white furniture overlooking SMOCA.   Food and drinks are good too. Their menu consists of salads, burgers, sandwiches. The dishes are about $8 - $10 and the servings are pretty large. The cocktails are great but pricey...completely worth it! Try their martini or mojito.

Oh, this place was worth the wait. My friends and I got there at 10:30AM and the wait was about 45min. Thankfully there was a farmers market across the street to keep me busy.   Matt's was very small and there were no bathrooms inside of building. Strange floor plan. I ordered a Cheese Omelet with peppers and ham, coffee, and OJ. The coffee was heavenly...it was what I've been looking for all morning. The OJ was surprisingly tiny...the glass was as tall my fingers, but it was very fresh. The omelet came with a side of home fries or hash browns and bread. I HIGHLY recommend the home fries, which is chopped potatoes cooked with onions and rosemary. I got the wheat bread which was delicious. This is not your typical plain/thin wheat toast!  The omelet was huge and so were the ingredients. The peppers which I thought was be sprinkled in like most places was actually a whole sauteed pepper. The ham was smokey and thick. The serving was pretty good for a $10 breakfast.   Overall, I think Matt's is superior to other popular breakfast joint such as the Breakfast Club or Orange Table. It was worth the wait, but I'll definitely be more strategic regarding the timing the next time around.

What a great secret find! This hidden sushi spot is small, quiet, and intimate. My friend and I sat at the sushi bar and the service was great. The sashimi was very fresh and the portions are good. The roll I had ordered was so so, but they have a good mix of traditional and special rolls. It was overall a pretty good experience.

I've been going to this barely visible coffee shop for almost ten years and it is one of the better ones. It is small and the crowd is mostly teens, but the coffee is good. They use Illy espresso beans which is rich and delicious. Their menu is simple with about 5 specialty drinks. I would definitely recommend the French Caramel Latte. It has a nutty flavor that goes great with the caramel.

Great atmosphere. This is a good place to go for a drink, but I'll never go back for sushi again. The sashimi was not especially fresh, the rolls were not memorable, and everything is overpriced. Even the happy hour menu was no good.

I expected better. When I first heard of Sen's concept ...Asian fusion tapas...I was really excited. It turned out to be nothing more than mediocre mixed Asian dishes in tiny portions. The Soup Gyoza is equivalent to something I can buy at Lee Lee's. The Ginger Mint Duck Salad was not very memorable. They flavors didn't come together and I didn't like the way they cooked the duck.  There were a few dishes I thought were pretty good. Go for the Lemongrass Clams and the Volcano Flamed is fun to eat (cooked on hot stone).  Conclusion - don't come if you expect great food. Not worth the high price they are charging. Come for the hip ambiance, live DJ, and specialty sake cocktails with friends.

I am a Yogurtland addict. Sometimes I have it as a meal. I've tried Pinkberry, Yogurtberry, Mojo, etc but nothing compares! Yogurtland has a wide selection of flavors...including some exotic Asian flavors such as Lychee and Taro (my fav). There's also a new flavor that comes out every few weeks. The add ons are pretty standard, but they have a more syrups than other yogurt shops. The fruits are fresh.

This is the most authentic CHINESE style ramen I've had in AZ. The best thing is that the noodle is made fresh. You can even see the chef toss/stretching the dough through the glass. The beef in the beef noodle soup is very tender, which is a plus plus in my book! The beef stew broth was also very flavorful. A bowl of noodles was only $7! I'll be going back real soon!

I love this place! I've never had dinner here, but it is a great place to go for happy hour and a night out.   Primebar is spacious with three bars, a dinning area, and a stage for live performances. The decor was modern/contemporary. The crowd consists of mostly people in their mid 30s to 50s, with a sprinkle of people in their late 20s.    I love the happy hour. The average price for happy hour is about $5/item and the portions are good. The drink specials are even better. Wines by the glass (really big glass) are half off and there are good deals on the cocktails as well. I highly recommend the margarita and the berry mojito.  As for food, go for the sliders and steak quesadilla.   Live performances start at around 10pm from Thursdays through Saturdays. The bands and type of music change week to week.
