Nice to finally meet you Comedor Guadalajara,  My husband and I really enjoyed our time here.  We were looking for decent Mexican food.  This was our first visit . . . the parking lot (behind the building) was large (and don't let the outside of the building defer you . . . it's big inside).  The service was great from the minute we walked in the door.  The margaritas were really good (you could actually taste the tequila).  Complimentary warm chips and spicy salsa.  We both had the beef tacos, rice and beans.  Great food.  This is going to be our new go-to place when we crave Mexican food.  Prices were very reasonable.  I can't wait to go back for breakfast and try the Huevos Rancheros.  Yum!

A trip to this place is fun and entertaining.  I could walk the isles for an hour just looking at everything.  If you love Mexican food you gotta come here.  And the market has the lowest prices for vegetables.  Cucumbers 6 for $1.00 and radishes 3 for $1.00!  I bought a large package of chicken breasts (5 big breasts) and they were only $4.32!  Went home and roasted them up the oven for chicken tacos.  The chicken was perfect.  Next time I'm there my plan is to stock up on chicken breasts for the freezer.  Did I mention the bakery?  Anyway, it's all good.

BEST CHICKEN WINGS EVER!  And the PIZZA is good too!  We used to go to the Red Devil way out in the West Valley.  Now that we have moved downtown we finally decided to give the original Red Devil on McDowell a try.  I was surprised and I'll just say "what a great place'!  Our server was Jenny . . . very pleasant and didn't hover over you.  We had our usual "Supremo" all meat pizza (pepperoni, sausage, canadian bacon and hamburger).  it was so good and tasted so close to what we had grown to love at our old stompin' grounds.  But the chicken wings were the star of the show.  Wings don't get any better that this.  Crispy, hot and I dare you to eat just one.  I'd go here just to order the wings to-go.  By the way, there is a $5 off coupon on their website.  $5 off any order of $30 or more (so get it before it expires).

I recently moved to Phoenix and needed to find a new salon after going to the same high-end place in Glendale.  Well, yelpers, the reason I went to Ide Mania was more than just because it was down the street.  The great reviews from previous clients lured me to the salon.  I had a great haircut from Lettie!  She nailed it the first time!  I'm going to become a regular.  Love the salon and the Aveda products they use.  The owner even came up and introduced herself and welcomed me and made me feel at home.  Love this place!  Thanks for being there Ide Mania!  I'll be seeing you.

Woohoo Chinese food!  Found out about this place from neighbors.  It's close enough to walk from my new condo.  Great service.  Once you step inside you get the feeling that you are in San Francisco for Chinese dining.  We loved the walnut fried prawns and the chicken curry!  This will be my new go-to place for Chinese food (dine in and take out).  China Chili, I'm glad you're nearby.

Cannoli.  This review is only for the cannoli.  5 stars!  They fill it while you wait.  Crunchy outside shell and creamy filling.  Absolute heaven.

Went to Las Glorias after seeing it on "Check Please Arizona".  The restaurant is all about fish.  It's not really "Mexican food".  Let me say our shrimp cocktail was very good.  We both had the tacos (I've had better).  I noticed at another table they were just having shrimp cocktails and drinks.  Now I know why.  If I every return it will be only for the shrimp cocktails and salsa and chips.  $50+ total for dinner (one shrimp cocktail, 2 taco dinners and 3 margaritas).  The beans and rice on my plate were cold (most places the beans are so hot you have to let them cool a bit before you take a bite).  Sorry Las Glorias, I'm new to downtown Phoenix and next time I'll try another Mexican restaurant.

Stopped by this week to check out their Christmas cookies.  They had so many types and the store was loaded with other goodies, fresh baked bread, pizzas to take n bake and they have fresh to order sandwiches.  My husband and I split one.  It was huge and so good!  I took some cookies home to sample and will be going back closer to Christmas to purchase more.  If you live in Surprise, give this "Mom and Pop" bakery a try.

Stopped by early this evening for dinner.  It was only a little after 5:00 p.m. and the place was packed.  We were greeted warmly and walked to a table.  Such cute decor inside.  The LARGE Margarita's were just that . . . LARGE!  And the chips and salsa were great.  Our combo plates were LARGE!  In a nutshell, this place is great!  We had the tacos and enchiladas, beans and rice (I'm stuffed).  I'd go back for sure.  I saw a guy having the shrimp cocktail and it looked so good.  Try this place . . . you won't be disappointed.

It was Friday and we didn't feel like going out.  Pizza you say?  Great, let's either fly to Chicago or get it delivered.  Been searching for good pizza since we moved to midtown.  We decided to try something new ... Pino's came to mind because of all the great reviews on Yelp.  I called and they told me they don't deliver after 2:00 p.m.  : ( So I folded and said OK we'll pick it up.  In a nutshell OUR PIZZA WAS AWESOME!  Now I know why they don't deliver after 2:00 p.m. (they don't have to).  We ordered sausage and mushroom pizza.  So good.  Crust was incredible.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers.  Parking can be an issue but it wasn't that bad once you know the drill.  I'll be seeing you again soon Pino.  You're my new best friend.

Good location for Scottsdale.  Restaurant is very nice on the inside.  The bar was packed (hey . . . it was on a Friday afternoon).  Sat in the dining room.  Dining room was pretty crowded already.  Lots of folks with small children but the children were behaving fine as it was still early in the evening.  Tourists in tee shirts and shorts.  It was Scottsdale after all and I suppose folks were on vacation.  I had the prime rib because of the earlier reviews I'd read here.  Prime rib was very good.  Just came on a plate with a side of mashed potatoes.  Pretty boring but I was hungry.  I loved the wedge salad.  It was full of blu cheese and bacon.  I'd get that again.  Husband had the crab cakes.  He said it was just OK.  All in all, I'd go back.  But I'd sit in the bar and order off the bar food menu.  One thing I didn't like.  Good service but she brought out our meal about 5 minutes after ordering.  I felt like I was at In n Out instead of having a relaxing meal on a Friday evening.

This place just isn't what it used to be.  Food has really gone downhill.  Our plates were mostly melted cheese.  Ugh.  After last nights two awful entrees, I'm done.  PS - This place needs a good cleaning.

Hey, wanna grab a burger?  We love this place!  It's basically a no frills bar and burger joint.  Huge burgers, cold beer and great lay back people watching.  Cash only.  Two can eat for under $20.  Gets crowded when the snowbirds come back to town.

Durant's is THE BOMB! First visit to Durant's last night.  I agree with other yelper's.  Durant's is BAD ASS!  Don't be fooled by the old building.  The parking lot is behind and they have valet if you are into that . . . we entered through the kitchen (cool) and were greeted by the kitchen staff!  Good thing we had reservations.  It was Friday and the place was PACKED!  Bar totally full.  Tables full.  Decor red velvet on the walls and red leather on the booths (that's the sure sign of an old time steakhouse).  I closed my eyes and felt like I was in New York City!  Our waitress was Patti and she was the best!  Our Delmonico steaks were to die for.  Salad wonderful with home made blue cheese dressing.  Shrimp cocktail with horseradish was perfect and best shrimp I've had in a long time.  Bread was very good.  EVERYTHING was THE BOMB!  It's expensive . . .  so I'd probably have to wait and come back for my birthday.  Dinner for two + wine + tip = $200.  Hey, it was the night before Christmas Eve.  Did I mention I tried to get reservations on Christmas Eve but they were totally booked.  Just go . . . take your friends but make them pay for their own.  Enjoy!

My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Durant's again for our annual Christmas Eve dinner.  FANTASTIC!  Ron was our server (so polite) and did a great job!  We started with shrimp cocktail $15.95.  It was the best I've ever had (my husband agreed).  Salads were excellent.  Two filet mignon steaks later; $89.00 but were they ever worth it!  Our steaks were cooked to perfection and melted in our mouths.  Sauteed Mushrooms $10.50 were so good as well and lots of them.  One bottle of wine and our total bill was $140.00.  This is only our 2nd time at Durant's.  I'm going back again next Christmas Eve for sure.  Hands down, we had one of the best meals ever!    PS - I love going in thru the kitchen.  Durants . . . BEST OF PHOENIX and it's in my neighborhood.  Thanks Durant's you are really something to remember.

Had lunch at CIBO today.  They only serve sandwiches at lunch.  I had the eggplant sandwich.  It was delish.  Served with a side salad.  Salad was just OK.  Ice tea very tasty.  Great urban feeling.  I want to go back in the fall and sit outside at night under the little white lights with a glass of wine and enjoy Phoenix.  And of course try one of their pizzas.

Stopped in for lunch today.  I've wanted to try this place for a long time.  1 - Frozen margaritas were very good, even at $7 each. 2 - Chips and salsa were great. 3 - Service was very good. 4 - Atmosphere nice with view of pond and turtles. 4 - However, entree was awful.  My chicken (pollo fundido) was extremely salty. 5 - I won't be back. 6 - Do yourself a favor; stop for cocktails and move on.

First time here earlier this week.  Wow ... this place is amazing.  New Mexico fare.  It's small just like some of the reviewers mentioned.  But it's perfect for two.  We had four in our party and we didn't have to wait very long.  The waiter was so nice and answered all our questions.  Yes, the food is spicy.  Yes, the food has a smoky flavor.  Yes, it's all good.  Perfect!  It's dark and romantic with candles burning.  And the bar seating looked awesome (you can watch them cooking).  I had the Carne Adovada (generous amount of melt in your mouth spicy pork with rice and beans).  Hey, I can eat, but I ended taking half of mine home.  Hubby had the Skewers.  He said they were really good and he'd order them again.  I'd go back in a minute.  Next time I want to try the bacon wrapped shrimp.  This would be a great place to show out of towners what Phoenix is really about.

I agree.  Nothing compares to the Ferry Building in SF, but it's off to a great start and since I moved to midtown the market is on my list of things to do every Saturday.  The bread is fantastic and I bought some of the Italian sauces to take home.  And the cheese!  PHX public market I love you.

I love their cupcakes!  They are just the right size and have just the right amount of frosting.  The cake is awesome too!  Tastes homemade.  Love, love, love them!  This is my go-to place when I want to pick up something wonderful for dessert.  I ordered a dozen chocolate for Christmas and everyone was impressed.  Those cupcakes were so fresh (just one smell of the box and you were in heaven).  If you go there, you might miss this place because it is hard to spot when driving by.  I wish they would put a huge cupcake right out front.  I am so glad I found this place.  Go . . . take friends or bring some home.  And go often.

Just stopped in at Al's after a few years living away from the West Valley.  It's the same as before . . . excellent!  They are closed SUN-MON-TUE, but plan ahead (it's a "Mom and Pop" kinda place and they deserve time off too).  I purchased some awesome steaks that melted in our mouths and some chicken breasts that were downright delicious!  I also picked up a couple of frozen meat loafs for the freezer.  Best meat loaf hands down.  What can I say?  I really missed Al's.  Nothing's changed.  I'll be back for sure.

Lunch went downhill today ... we were hungry and decided to stop at Red Robin.  To begin with, I had to ask the server to wipe off the table.  The place had just opened for lunch and all the tables looked like they had been hastily wiped down from the night before and put out to the pasture to dry.  Even the menus were sticky.  Gross.  Burgers were just "OK".  Lots of sloppy sauce.  Nothing to write home about. Meh.  I ate the meat and left the bun.  $22 for two burgers.  We won't be back.    PS- This place needs a good cleaning.

New to Phoenix and my first time to St. Francis .  And was it great!  It's got the bistro vibe.  White tablecloths covered in paper (that's OK) and the place was busy, busy, busy.  We sat upstairs but next time I want to be where the action is (downstairs even though it was loud down there).  Our waiter was fab; did I mention he looked like Louie C.K.? The wine was a big pour, and the food, oh the food!  We all had the french onion burgers and they were so darn good.  But the best part was the side of polenta.  it was the best polenta I have ever had (creamy and out of this world).  Everyone was too full for dessert.  We had reservations and even got a call that afternoon from the restaurant confirming (that was a nice touch).  What would I ask the St. Francis to improve?  Their menu is in really small print and hard to read if you "forgot your reading glasses".  Thanks for a nice evening St. Francis.  See you next time.

First time here.  Had a late lunch today because we had a gift card from our son.  This place is OK.  That's about all I can say . . . 2 pizza's + 2 beers = $30.  Crust is very thin.  Go if you love thin dry crust.  Don't think I'd ever go back.  There were a few tables with dirty dishes.  They weren't busy at all.  Wish I could say more.  I'm sorry but this place didn't excite.

It's been several years since we dined at P. F. Chang's.  What a nice meal!  We loved the Lettuce Wraps and the Crispy Honey Chicken and the Singapore Street Noodles.  Our server was Morgan and she did an excellent job.  The guys who brought out our appetizers and entrees were also very professional.  I'll be coming back for more.

- Moving isn't fun.  We've used Camelback Moving twice now.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother calling anyone else when you need movers.  From the ladies on the phone to the two guys moving all our belongings you couldn't ask for any better service.  Truck was on time and arrived at our new residence as promised.  Very courteous and professional.  - But Camelback Moving makes moving bearable.

Visited Dillon's Grand last night for the first time.  It's located in Sun City Grand on the golf course.  Nice views of the course and lake.  Older crowd.  The onion rings were very good.  The food is average and seemed a little pricy for what you get.  I had the pulled pork . . . they served it with a hard hamburger bun on the side (which I didn't even bother with).  All in all . . . it's OK.  We ordered the nachos and I must say they were pretty good. Not sure I'd go back . . . I'll wait until I get a little older.

I would have to say the Arrowhead Grill is possibly the best dining in the West Valley.  Don't let the location (in a small strip mall) stop you from visiting.  Once you walk through the door the dark wood and booths take you to that steakhouse level.  Our Delmonico steaks were so tender and full of flavor.  Caesar salads wonderful.  And the complimentary bread assortment was excellent.  We were too full for dessert.  I would have loved to try the Butter Cake.  Next time for sure.  Make a reservation.  It was Saturday night and the place was packed but the service was spot on.

I agree with what was recently mentioned . . . there are a few instructors that have the music way too loud and the class can't hear them.  Meh.  A yoga studio should be a peaceful place.  If I want to hear yelling and loud music then I'll go to a rock concert.

Decide to give Scramble a try . . . a drive from the West Valley.  It was OK.  Just OK.  The eggs were good (we had the scramble).  The toast was cold and dry (they could have buttered it while it was hot).  The rosemary potatoes could have been great . . . but the potatoes were cold.  $22 later and 99% sure I won't return.  $2.30 for a coffee is way to much $$.  Hint . . turn down the music (it was Sunday morning early and the music was way too loud).

Short and sweet.  1st time to Postino Central and LOVE the bruschetta!  OMG it's all good.  I might come back very soon and order some "to go".  Just a thought ... noise level is high.  NOT a place for children.  People were enjoying happy hour and It's very loud in there and someone had a tiny little baby.  Take that baby home and put it to bed.  I'm sure it was crying because it's ears hurt.  (My ears hurt listening to the baby cry.)

I was looking for a butcher and I am so glad I found this place!  The BACON is soooooo good!  I also asked for some thick cut pork chops which I stuffed with Fontina cheese for New Years eve.  They were so tender.  I made my decision and won't look back.  This place is my new meat shop.  Can't wait to return to try their steaks and brisket.  Also looking forward to seeing them at the downtown farmer's market.  No more AJ's for me.  PS- I love the way they package the meat.  Great for freezer or fridge.  UPDATE . . . One year later . . .  December 1, 2012, still going to The Meat Shop.  I ordered some meatballs for the first time.  They look so good.  Making spaghetti n meatballs for dinner (I didn't have to do all the work of making meatballs).  Check out my pictures Yelpers.

My first visit to "The Parlor".  Stopped in for a late lunch yesterday and snagged a table outside on the patio.  We both ordered the spinach salad.  It was loaded with bacon, tomatoes, white cheese, avocado and garnished with a sliced hard boiled egg.  Added roasted chicken which made it a meal in itself.  Our beer was served ice cold and that's good because that is how I like my beer.  Bottom line, this place is great.  I can't wait to return for another salad and to sample something new.   Price point is a bit high but you get what you pay for: $27 for two wonderful salads (yum) $6 for adding roasted chicken $5 Guinness $4 Sierra Nevada Pale Ale Total lunch $45

This review is just for the service.    I really wanted to like this place.  OK, we arrive early for dinner.  They proceed to sit everyone who enters in the same section.  So you have a restaurant 1/2 full and everyone is right next to each other.  Servers are scarce.  This place really needs to hire more help.  During our time there, we could hear the management talking down to a server near the kitchen.  Food was good, but when we were ready to leave = not a server around to take our money.  We finally got up, walked up to the cash register only to have some woman (who clearly didn't know what she was doing) "charge someone else's order" on my debit card and then proceed to say "sorry".  Took my bank 6 days to credit me back her mistake.    Next visit I'll only order takeout and pay with cash.

Ok.  Went there last night.  We don't have a lot of choices way out here in the West Valley.  The service and food were great.  Tables were clean.  Curry chicken and shrimp fried rice were both excellent.  I'll be coming back again.  If you want to try some good Chinese food this is the place.  Take out also.

Just discovered Sugar Daddy Cupcakes . . . there was an article in the AZ Republic (I never knew there was a cupcake place at the mall).  It's hidden near the children's play area in the Arrowhead Mall.  I had the white cake with buttercream and coconut.  It was huge and soooooo ymmmy!  Will be heading back to sample more next time I'm at the mall.  I'm so glad I found this place.  Their cupcakes boxes are perfect for taking them home to enjoy later that day.  Just try it . . . you won't be disappointed.

My son told me about Culver's a few weeks ago.  Well . . . I tried it and now I love Culver's burgers and fries.  No, it's not In-N-Out, but pretty darn close.  I happen to like burgers that are a bit greasy and crispy.  And best part is they let you add "what you want".  Lettuce, tomato, mayo.  Love it!  Fries were hot and crispy.  This place is very clean and that is one of the things that keeps me coming back.  Looking forward to trying their custard (not now . . . I've got a standing appointment with a treadmill this week).  Culver's, I'm glad you're in my neighborhood.

Make an appointment for 1st thing in the morning.  Henry has been doing my nails for several months and does an excellent job.  Pedicures are great too.  Don't worry about getting your nails done inside of a WalMart.  It's a no brainier because the price is so reasonable.

Stopped by for a quick lunch on a Sunday.  Parking lot didn't have many cars.  Now I know why.  This place needs a good cleaning (inside and out).  Parking lot had trash everywhere.  I had to wipe the table off with a napkin before I could sit down.  Staff didn't seem too interested in working if you know what I mean.  Management must have taken the day off.  I won't be back ... Ever.

Great little Mexican restaurant!  Breakfast is awesome.  No frills; just really good food.  Lots of folks getting to-go orders in the morning.  And during the week construction workers coming in for early lunch.  I'm glad I found this place.  That place across the street has lost my business forever.

Thanksgiving Day.  Party of two.  Turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes all served cold.  Service slow.  $65 per person was way too much for what it turned out to be.  And they automatically added a 20% tip and then asked for more.

Our 1st visit to Renegade Canteen last night.  We made reservations and were a little late getting there,  but they had our table waiting which was nice because the place was packed.  Atmosphere is very nice.  Beautiful building and a nice layout.  Next time we plan to eat in the bar.  We had to try Bob's Big Burger and what a big burger it was!  Quality meat (bacon was to die for).  Big onion, big tomato.  What more could you ask for?  Mr. McGrath was in the restaurant and he came by our table to say hello and ask if we were enjoying ourselves.  Great guy!  And our waiter was very attentive (not pushy) but always seemed to show up at the right time.  We plan on going back for sure.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.  Catch Chef McGrath on Channel 8 PBS "Check Please, Arizona".  He does a good job and watching the show makes you hungry.  Thanks Renegade Canteen for having us.

I was looking for a new salon in Phoenix, and reading the great reviews from Yelp of Salon Embellish, I took a chance and made an appointment. First look = salon is hip and clean.  Dionna did my highlights and cut.  I was so pleased.  She took her time with me and did a great job with my color and cut.  I'm planning to go back for sure. Thanks Dionna.  Glad I found you.  Last look = very professional service. If you need a change, visit Salon Embellish.

We recently moved to midtown Phoenix and needed to find a new cat sitter.  It's always hard to give someone you just met a key to your home and leave town, but after reading the previous reviews on Yelp I decided to give Jen a call and I'm glad I did.  She came over as promised to meet with us and took notes about our needs and a few days later off we went for a weekend get-a-away.  We had a little problem as I gave her the wrong key (totally my fault) but it all worked out in the end.  Oh, and our kitty even got a report card and a new kitty toy (left by Jen).  Jen's our new go-to when we have to leave town.  Thanks for everything Jen!

Sometimes you just feel like getting up, grabbing a hat and going out to breakfast.   Meh.  I can make better eggs at home.  Scrambled eggs were dry.  Potatoes way too salty (could have used some onion).  Sausage was just OK.  $2 for two slices of toast.  I should have saved my $ and went to McDonalds.  I'm just saying ... This place didn't do it for me.  The place had lots of "regulars" in there ... older guys stopping in for their "regular dose of Joe's".  Ho hum.  I doubt if I will ever return.  So it's back in the saddle again heading to Matt's Big Breakfast.  When I want breakfast again, Matt, you're my man.

Best pizza in the West Valley!  So sad that Duner's left town, but now there is a decent pizza place fairly close to home.  And ... they deliver!  Wings are good too.  Next time you are craving pizza and don't want to drive, call for delivery.  You won't be disappointed.  We had the meat pizza and also the sausage.  Their sausage is delicious.  Just go for it!

Visited Windsor last night for the 1st time.  Excellent!  LOVE THIS PLACE!  It's got a good urban bistro atmosphere.  Seating inside or out.  It was Friday a little after 5:00 p.m. and the place was packed.  The wait for a table wasn't long and both the bartender and server were very good.  Our beers (Stella Artois on draft) were cold and refreshing.  We started with the loaded chips with bacon and they were so darn tasty!  I had the brown bag chicken sandwich since someone here on Yelp recommended it (thanks Jessica W.).  Sandwich was large and the chicken was so tender.  My side was kale salad (never had kale salad before but now I'm hooked).  Husband had the crab cake sandwich.  He said it was excellent and his cole slaw was the best!  I CAN'T WAIT to go back!  Good job Windsor . . . see you soon.  Did I mention you can eat at the bar?  Good place for people watching and you can also see the chefs hustling back in the kitchen.

None of the shoes in this store have any prices on them.  Just saying ...  But when it comes to athletic shoes, I like buying at small stores rather than big box stores.  You get better one on one service, however I deducted one star because the gal who was helping me dropped the ball as she was more interested in getting a free item from some vendor who happened to be in the store.  After she disappeared, I took the shoes I wanted to purchase up to the cash register and stated to another gal "I'll take these as I have no idea where the person who was helping me went".  When you have a customer who is spending $200 you can at least say "Can you excuse me for a few minutes".

Agree with Bryan A.  This place needs a manager.  Sad.  Two young teenagers left there working alone.  The guy seemed to know what he was doing, however the gal working with him was totally useless.  She didn't know the menu, didn't know how to make a sub (BLT) and clearly didn't know how to use the cash register.  And one large fly buzzing around the meat and cheese station.  Ugh.  I'm done.

New to the neighborhood here in Phoenix.  I was looking forward to checking it out.  Burgers ... Just OK. Milkshake ... Really good. Service ... Just OK. Sad to say I won't be back (unless all I'm craving is a milkshake).   Culver's is much better for burgers and fries and their service is five stars  everyday.  Just say'in ...

Little Gem Caesar . . . perfect for two to share.  Big Star pizza . . . so good!  Loved the decor!  Beer, food and tip came to just under $40.  LOVED this place!  Nice feel on the inside and out.  Great decor.  Candles were such a nice touch.  Loved sitting at the bar.  Bartender and server were very pleasant.  Music was loud but just loud enough (you could still have a conversation).  Best part is it's in my neighborhood.  Welcome to the neighborhood Federal Pizza.  I can't wait to go back!

Love Halo and all that they do.  We adopted our cat from them.  If you are looking for a new pet please consider visiting them and of course check out their animals at PetSmart stores.

If you are ever in need of a podiatrist this is the place for you.  I recently moved back to the West Valley and was still experiencing heel pain (even though I saw a foot doctor in Phoenix).  Hands down, Dr. Bates and his staff were the best.  They really listened to my issues.  My foot started feeling so much better after the procedure (shot of corodisone).  I feel so lucky having found Dr. Bates.  Yes, I found him here on Yelp.

Pick one of their creations or invent your own custom 11 inch pie!  This place is new in town.  Great little concept (think Subway, but pizza and salad) in the Park Central Mall in Phoenix.  Not a big sign out front but near Starbucks and The Good Egg.  Close to home so stopped in last night for take-out.  It doesn't take long for the pizza to cook (thin, crispy crust).  My pesto chicken pizza was excellent.  Hubs steak and blue pizza rocked as well.  We shared a steak and blue salad with balsamic dressing and it was also very good.  Good portion of romaine, thin sliced steak, mushrooms, onions, peppers and Gorgonzola.  You can add anything else you want as well.  Glad this place is near when I need salad or personal pizzas.

We received an e-mail telling us that we would receive a free "health check" on our Dyson machine if we visited the service center by August 4.  Took our one year-old Dyson 41 in today and we were beyond satisfied with their customer service.  While we waited, Marco checked out our vacuum and replaced a broken part free of charge.  I'm so glad they opened this place in Phoenix.  FYI - It's located in a business park and is a little hard to find if you are not familiar with the area, so just check out the directions before you leave home.  Thanks Dyson and Marco!

So glad POMO opened way out here in the West Valley.  We really needed this. Went for the first time last night and everything was great.  The place was packed for a Thursday night.  The hostess was pleasant.  We had a great waiter and when we were leaving one of the managers asked how they were doing.  Well ... they did just fine.  Loved the decor, the pizzas were awesome, wine was very good.  Next time I want to eat outside.  Cool vibe with the blue lights in the trees.  Welcome to the neighborhood POMO.  I'll be back soon.  You are my new best friend.

Double burger pretty good. Chicken burger really crispy and pretty good. Shake pretty good. Fries pretty good. End of the story is two burgers, one order of fries, one small shake and one small soda was $28!
