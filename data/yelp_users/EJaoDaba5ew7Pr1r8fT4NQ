Great place to find inexpensive, gently used item for your infant and bigger child. From bedding, highchairs and excersaucers to clothes and shoes and toys. They have a 50/50 consignment plan ( cash or store credit) and will display everything for 90 days. If it doesn't sell you get all your non sold items back.  The new management that took over the business last February vamped the store up and it looks better and better and they are super friendly and always willing to help. Always had a great experience. They have a Facebook page too in which they list new item in pictures. Highly recommended.

Seems like they already lost their spirit. When you walk in, the owner doesn't look like she loves her job, but is an average hired employee. That after only one year of owning the business. One of the owner left and it seems she carried the spirit. They don't care about marketing. Their flyers that are send per e-mail are unfinished templates, have no appeal. They have a huge competitor down the street and I have found myself there more and more and started consigning there.  There FB page gets barely frequent attention. An occasional photo gets posted. I hope they pick it up and blow some fire in the business.  The concept is great, the people that own/work the business can make it fantastic.

Best Chinese place and the friendliest service. Yummy Mu shu chicken, rolled up vor you at the table. Inded , yhe service with the bowtie is a great assest (isn't he the owner?). Also, this is a place that listens when you request spicy. Just because you're white, a lot of restaurants will adjust the spicyness, not here they'll a comodate the customers wishes.

What a great place for the men in our lives, whether big or small. My son had his first haircut today and Diane took care of the business. Prepared to have him not wanting to cooperate, she switched the tv to Nick and made him play.  This place has the great barber chairs and has a great musky smell. They sell giftcards and so a great gift for the male in your life. At the end they gave my son a certificate for completing his first haircut.

Went for breakfast this morning. Everything was made fresh, even the bran muffin came hot out of the oven. It was busy, but slowed down while there. Our server Cheryl was great, stayed on top of service and very friendly. Great prices too. $3.99 kids breakfast and pretty big portions for that money. Only thing, the changing table in the restroom could use a disinfecting scrub down.

I have taken my now 15 month old son to both the dance and gym which are free for him. It seems he already like the gym better and so we stuck with that for now, maybe in a few months we try dance again. Ms Caroline is very fun and tries to really interact with the children to get their groove on.  Jumping Genie (?) is the gymnastic instructor and makes it fast paced. It took some adjustment for my boy to get used to, but he seemed to like it better last time, so we keep moving. The only thing I wonder if they sanitize all the toys after each session, especially during flu season as they were just left there and not separated out.

Went to babytime this morning. What a joke. We are used to Burton Bar and that is always great. It started at the front desk where the rep said: Is there any? It repeats every week. Duh.   It started 5 minutes late and she ran through the program within 17 minutes. 6 songs, 2 books, bubbles....great pace for crawlers. Oh, and she didn't really sing. Everything was on cd. The remote was her friend. It was chaos and only 6 kids were present. Then she dumped toys on the floor and left the room. She didn't put any effort in creating a group event. All parents chatted during the program, it eas a mess. I wondered if we were done or not.....so I left. I'll drive to central library anytim. What a joke.

I love the food...however service here is horrible. Outright Horrible.  I have been working in this area for the past 7 months and not 1 time out of 7 was eithe my order ready or complete/correct. Yesterday I told a co-worker I would give them 1 last chance and place my order 1.5 hour in advance to the to go optin online. Guess what.....didn't get the right dressing, salad looked curly and old and there was no soup with my order.  A manager had to come out to swipe his card to see my order and yet they didnt realize my order wasn't correct. I wanted to order online for convenience, as I have only a 30 minute break. drive out, pay, grab food and leave. No EVERYTIME my food still needs to get ready. 2 weeks ago my soup dropped on the floor, but the carry carton wasn't folded correctly, the time before that my soad was spilled all over my food, because of the same reason. They rush, rush and don't pay attention to their customers. Back in March I had 1 hour lunch, sat down with 2 co-worker, no one came up to us for 20 minutes, we left our table to order to go. it took them an other 10 minutes to notice us. A'manager' came rushing by to apologize ' to be oh so sorry, here have some free muffins' and left. 15 minutes later, they didnt know how to swipe our cards, but the 'manager' kept looking in our direction, but didn't take any actions, I guess muffins do for any mess up. When I filled out the online questionaire for free muffins and I gave them 1's, it disconnected me and no code. I will not recommend them to any of my friends. I will NOT go bacck here for my lunch.  1 mess up can be forgiven, but 6 out of 7 (!!!) NO, NO. I am done.  I heard Jason's deli across the street has great salads.......

I ordered for a few co-workers and I. First time and sadly enough last time. Very bland, I can't even finish my dish. Also the bag I had my boxes in had all the sauces mixed together and openend and the boxes weren't clsoed fully. I ordered for 4 people and none of them liked their food. Would think it could be just me, bit obviously not. Eeeww.

Can you say yum! Finally a place that makes bread. The soggy dough in your average supermarket can't be called bread. As a European and a grand daughter of a baker, this place gets it. The only sad thing is that bread is pricey here. We went for breakfast here last week. Fabulous coffee and free refills. Awesome passionfruit ice tea ( I had to try both). Even the kids menu was great. Cute sand dollar size pancakes. Another plus, they have the Hero brand jelly. Great Swiss quality I used to back home. All fruity goodness without the high fructose corn syrup. Yay. Will be back many, many times and get the holiday bread. Willing to shell out a bit more to even buy their loaves.

My bimbimbap place to be. Korean food is one on my favorite ethnic foods. It was my pregnancy addiction. Too bad it's too pricey go daily or my dh would have had to take me there every day or move to Korea. The service has always been great. We also tried the barbeque and just the same great experience. I often see Koreans and other Asian people here and my thought is, if the local people get their fix at a restaurant that sweve their home cooking, it must be good and authentic. Yum. Love it.

One of the locations I do my weekly grocery shopping. Love that they carry most of the Boiron line ( homeopathic medicine). Great organic options. Only quirk is that the people behind the meat/fish counter either don't wash their hands where handling the food or not wash it the way it should. Holding it under running water is not washing your hands. Miss Deborah, the girl with the British accent, but understand why she left. Really like Annalee(?) and the newly hired Devin. There is one guy (Stephen) that doesn't seem to like his job. Doesn't talk to you or with an uhuh..., as soon as he's done bagging, he grabs his cell phone, right in front of you and starts texting or what else he might be doing on there. Other than that, great store. When I was pregnant they always carried everything back in the cart for me, to wheel of. Do really like this location.

The best Asaian store around. Love the selection. Awesome smoked herring for cheap. Everything is so much cheaper and better than any other Asian store I've been.

This is not a recent update, but I was reminded.  Only reason we haven't gone back is the drive and a baby. As a European, I love wine and evenmore cheese. Now, American cheese is.NOT. Cheese. Just so you know. We ordered this scrumptious plate with bread , fruit and seveal cheese and had great wines (in the right type of glass). Very nice place. Great atmosphere and nice, friendly service.

We frequent this park on a weekly basis, especially now we have a child. The playground is fun and greatly upgraded a few years ago. Great for a nice stroll. In the trees over the lake there are a bunch of lovebirds, very cute. The views are awesome.

Love Hissyfits. Honestly, I needed to get used to HF as the store is really packed and hard accsible for strollers or wheelchairs. It took me awhile to feel the love. I used to be a frequent Babybloomers girl, but their spirit has gone down. Hf knows marketing. Marketing and social networking is how todays businesses get their names out. You MAKE time for this, when you LOVE your business. The girls at HF do. They make every effort to get their merchandise out. Keep on top of their wishlist as much as they can and post pictures on their FB page. They have 'magnet moms' and reward moms/dads to help to get their name out. They are not afraid of taking abit of risk and it pays off. They just opened a second location in Scottsdale. Their way of marketing is benfitial for them as well as their consigners, because when your item sells you get money or store credit. Nothing but praise for Hissyfits. You guys rock!

Loved the Kale salad. Kale is popular where I am from, but the person I brought along was staring at the dish, initially. When she ate it, she actually liked it. Love the presentation. Had a great sandwich as well, good  enough to share. Nice location as well

Yum. After doing some shopping at the Mekong plaza we decided on having lunch here. Very clean, which is a big plus for a Vietnamese establishment. The food was great, very tasty. Would love to back.

Love the food and what a great prices, how can they pull it off. Ate there twice now and would live to go more often if I had the chance. Service is great and friendly. Great young coconuts with loads of juice and meat for a great pirce. The 1 star missing is for the gross high chair we recieved for my child. I had to go to the car to get a cover to have him sut in it. Also the floor and walls can use a serious scrub down. However the food is so awesome, I'll see it through, just here.

Have been doing take out for the gyro and had a souvlaki plate in. Both time great. Being from Europe I do miss Mediterenean food and it satifies my graving. However, I still miss the real charred flavor of the souvlaki with the tzaziki sauce, greek style. This comes pretty close. Love the rice.

Great place. We found out about this place initially by driving by as so many business have come and gone at this location the past 3 years.  We sampled their tacos at the Duck and Decanter festival and went in the Friday after.  They had $1 mini pastor burritos (I think, as a European I have a hard time with Mexican food and what is called what) Also had the $4 Margarita and was very good for the price. Nice tang and a good amount of alcohol for the price. Will come back.

Forget Starbucks, they have the best coffee here. As a European it's clear that they don't know how to make coffee in America, until you get to Joe's diner. They have the story behind their coffee on their menu. The servers think apparently so too, as one brought me a cup and 5 seconds later another offered me a refill when I hadn't started yet. And she asked me if I was sure.  The pastrami sandwich was good. Not excellent, have had better. If I could come in just for a fix of coffee I would be very happy.

Love to have a new 'favorite' coffee spot. Too bad when Willow house left the Mcdowell area. The outdoor seating is awesone, but don't  try to get in there either with a stroller or wheelchair. There is a big step you need to get up to get in the front door. Yes, these are the old downtown houses, such a pretty neighborhood again. It has risen from the death :) Going again this weekend. Love the crepes, yummy choices, especially as a European, I am loving it when they know how to make good crepes.

First of all, Groupon users don't have to be aware of anything, as stated in a previous review. It clearly says 1 per table and the bar isn't a table. Duh!. My hubby and I went last night.  We were seated very quickly and our great server Ricky came within minutes. He is a very pleasant person and a great asset to the business. Also, even from a distance, a blonde girl, who bartending, beamed with energy and was interacting with those at the bar all the time. It didn't go unnoticed. What a great atmosphere. My husband ordered the pernil, as he does at the bistro. I had the chicken. We were given the chips and salsa, the salsa could use a bit more tang, but over all good. Hubby also ordered the fuego (fuego) margaritha, with jalapenos, chilis and habaneros. He loves hot and boy it made him sweat, so he loved it. I had the mojito, staying on the save, but yet yummy drink, side. We were wondering how they ever got that great chandelier up, must have been a nice job to do :) The place beams with atmosphere and I really hope they will succeed. Groupon is a great way to introduce your business to the people. We would have never found the bistro if not for groupon. We will be back and tell others about this great, little spot.

Toddler Tuesday was priced okay as we had the toddler area almost to ourselves the first hour, however, it's not as clean as I would like. My boy got mad because he found snacks under the step stool of the bouncy castle. We brought our own sippycup and snack and ate it there. As there NOT a single healthy item on the menu....oh, yeah, organic milk, but what if your child is lactose intolerant...fairly common. the place is really small and gets crowded fast, brace yourself going there for the summer when school is out. Toddler Tuesdays, during summer will be only up to six years, but it can get full too easy. One other thing that took a star away is the music. Loud and obnoxious pop music with a lot of cussing. Something that shouldn't be played in a kid friendly environment.  Yes, we would go back early mornings and for the toddler Tuesday, but the parents night out and birthday parties. NEVER!

Yay, FINALLY!!! I can eat Fu Fu again. I had an awesome meal today. Started of with the pom pom, yummy, nice starchy, sweet balls. Those were quickly gone. My hubs and I both ordered the Eugusi. I love goat and it was flavored awesome. Very unique African flavor. The Fu Fu had great consistency and our son loved it too. I love eating my African food with my hands, the African way and here it was not looked upon, but made you feel included in the African family. After the meal, the owne brought a jug with water and some soap and a Bowl to rinse our hands. I would eat here every day (if I could afford it). As desert we had fried plantain, more for my son, who loved it and we snacked along. We were stuffed, but I have found a place to get my Fu Fu fix again.   The place is nice, clean and super friendly. A big recommendation for those who prefer something different, but delicious food.

A huge YES! for this place. Order the pizza , just the way you like it. I am not the only one who thinks that way, because on the cool days, the line sometimes goes out the door. I love my Alfredo base and all veggies. My  favorite combination of veggies. Create your fantasy pizza here. Love it and come back...just a warning...You'll eat it all..in one sitting. Just don't count calories that day...just enjoy.
