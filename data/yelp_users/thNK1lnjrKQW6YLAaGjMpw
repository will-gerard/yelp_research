Amazing! I mean how many shops can actually be proud to be a BBB member let alone win the Ethics award! My service choice hands down even thought it's 30 miles from home!

Carefree Hwy may have moved but this landmark is still here! Cranking out the coldest beers and a killer burger! Been coming here since 1990 and never enjoyed it more than I do now!! Finally tried the chili tonight and regretting completely that I have not before today! Holy crap! Worth the drive from town just for it!  Do yourself a favor.. Slow down.. Stop in... Enjoy.. Support great local small business like this gem!

Horrible, sleezy and poorly run. The manager (Fred Durst wannabe) was a complete arrogant prick. So bad in fact that we had to leave. The staff is incompetent and even worse this place has an O.T.B section full of disgusting older men.. worst idea to date.. will never be back! Someone should call John Taffer this place needs it!

NEW HAPPY HOUR SPOT! Came in for dinner last night greeted and sat very quickly. Discovered the "Bail Out" menu.. Large pitchers of draft beer for $5... SOLD! Ordered a pizza and enjoyed both!   Best part is the happy hour runs until 7pm! Being that I work in Scottsdale and live in Arrowhead it's great to find a place I can actually make it to happier hour close to home!

Just finished what I would say was my best cut and shave in all of my 32 years. AL is amazing.. you could say a gentle giant.. found this place in a whim and so glad I did! I will be back as AL has earned my business!

Our anniversary spot this last week, we had a great living social deal for all you can eat fondue so how could you not love that! We had a new server (to his admission) but it didn't show. They really train the new hires well our night was fantastic and we will be back for sure!   Great place for the wife/GF if you haven't tried it yet you really should it's worth the price tag!

Only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is the wait time..Great fresh food but slow to get the order out. Great otherwise! :)

This place with the previous bar staff was less than my favorite however Kayla the Sunday day bartender and crew have recaptured us on all of our recent visits. Great place for Golden tee and bfast on a sunday!
