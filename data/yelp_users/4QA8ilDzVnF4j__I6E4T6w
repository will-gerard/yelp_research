I haven't been to Fox Sports Grill for a year and yesterday I decided to go there for my birthday dinner.  Wow, I was disappointed.  They totally changed out the menu selection.  They changed from a high end American cuisine to a regular bar type food.  TGI Friday have more selection then them.  I ordered a Kobe Beef slider and I didn't care for it.  Also, only little amount of fries came with it.  Plus the service was slow.  The whole restaurant seems to be empty.  After dinner with friends, we went over to the bar side of the restaurant.  There was a live band performing but hardly anyone was there.  They have tons of nice flat screen and few pool table.  I definitely don't recommend the food.  But if you want the whole restaurant to yourself then I guess that will be alright.

I went to Culinary Dropout with my hubby tonight.  We just missed their happy hour which ends at 6pm but we did enjoyed a nice dinner there.  We shared the pretzel fondue which was simply delicious.  We found out that they make their own pretzel bread daily.  The pretzel bread is soft and has a right amount of saltiness.  The cheese fondue is perfectly match with the pretzel bread.   We really loved the atmosphere as well.  Their style is like a gastropub (a modern house which specialize in serving high quality food) in Europe with a splash of Southern Mix.  We appreciated the chef really focus on the food freshness and quality.  Plus it definitely a great place for happy hour, dinner, and watching a game.  They have live music on Friday night and Saturday.

I went there for lunch today for the first time.  I was impressed with the burger.  I ordered a Mushroom Swiss burger.  The mushroom has a good sauteed and the burger was very juicy and tasty.  You can tell they really marinated the beef well.  It reminds me of Zin Burger in a way that the beefs are tender and juices splash out as you bite into it.  I don't really care for the fries that much.  It was little greasy and salty. The price is reasonable. Also, definitely need to wash your hands after eating the big juicy burger.  =)

My husband and I went there for dinner tonight.  It was formerly Bice Bistro.  They have the same management but with new name, decor, and menu.  The food was horrible.  We ordered a Caesar Salad and Choose your own pasta-- Penne with Mushroom Sauce w/ added Chicken.  The Caesar Salad was over dressed with dressing.  The mushroom sauce was tasteless.  We asked the waiter if the sauce is sort of creamy and he said yes.  But when the sauce came it was basically mushroom and olive oil.  The added chicken was totally bland.  Not taste and texture to it at all.  However they do have a $2 dollar Sam Adams beer promotion.  When my husband ordered they went out of the beer but the waiter decided to open the Sam Adams lite beer to my husband without asking.  My husband and I definitely not planning to go back.  I heard they opened this month, too bad they didn't improve the restaurant from the previous at all.
