Flowers by Renee delivered a plant to a close friend of our family. I received a text message from her and the plant and delivery made her day! Thank you flowers by Renee!

Bottom line, you are not a Phoenician if you haven't eaten at Durant's. Perfect cut, perfect pairing. Prefect valet Chris! Lovely Serafina!

Today super slow return and exchange service. Since everything else is self serve maybe they should consider doing self service returns.

People waiting everywhere, pregnant lady and all. 6 empty tables outside 4 inside! If you can't take care of your customer it doesn't matter how good your food is! Checked in and out.

Hopefully their food is better than their attitude. Don't worry your faces won't break if you smile. The real Barrio Cafe 16th and Thomas might want to give a pep talk to the hostess. Ana was sweet

Great service. Make reservations, they do take walk ins but they are so popular you may wait. Worth it though!

Food is fair, lots of TV's. Today however the waitress and management  felt compelled to chastise us once, twice and then a third time when the manager came to let us know the errs of moving a table to accommodate 6 adults and 2 children party size ( they had us at two small tables and we moved the third over).  Get over yourselves, the place was empty and the #USA vs #POR wasn't starting for three hours.  Thank you Zipps for making a stressful day in 105 degrees just a little more miserable. Up side went home made delicious shrimp and saved money. If I could give no stars I would today.

Kennedy and Terri (tech) were fantastic. Professional and efficient. If you live in Ahwatukee or close by go here for your imaging! I have been to other places and by far this was perfect for timely appointment and quick day of needs. Now off to work

Love this place but today was disappointed in service, seen it busier.  They had three different servers for a small area, which of course lends for disparity in treatment.  Maybe they are just too big time now?
