Not a very friendly menu for a person with gluten intolerance but the chicken was *very* good although practically the only thing I can eat. The reason for the low rating was this location had horrible AC and bad AC in the dead of the Phoenix monsoon season is not a place to enjoy a good meal. The "atmosphere" was positiviely soupy between the kitchen and what seemed like a swamp cooler.

Ever since I was diagnosed with a Gluten intolerance, Chipotle's yummy burrito bowl has been my constant companion. The barbacoa is seasoned well and works even better with a kick of the Chipote Tabassco sauce!

I love my Aloha Pineapple, but I hate bananas! Every JJ I've visited is happy to substitute the bananas for more strawberries - yum! This location is clean and the staff is friendly.

FYI: Google/Yelp renders the location incorrectly, it's actually about a mile south of where it appears making this a difficult location to check-in at. It's in the shopping center just south of the 202 next to Ono's Hawaiian BBQ. Bing maps this address correctly, Google will if you change the Address to Gilbert 85236.
