My 13 mo. old had to have surgery. Dr. Gleason was his surgeon, Mary was his nurse and a hand full of other smiling faces help us on our big day. They took such great care of my baby, gave him wagon rides, toys, bubble and hugs and tickles. Not a single complaint.  I hope I never have to go there again,  but I'll be glad if I do.

Four and a half stars.  Fresh and Delicious. Ill say it again. Fresh and Delicious. The food gets 5 stars. Seating/ outside patio is where I doc points. Oh, and the beverage selection. I don't want to go next door and stand in another line for my drink. If they had fresh juices or something I would look past the seating. The patch of grass behind the building is nice on a cloudy day.   you will see me there again. I would like to eat there on a Monday.  and I have nursed in the parking lot.

I recently had a consultation regarding collecting a judgement on an evicted tenant. The Attorney I spoke with frankly told me that for the amount of my judgement it wasn't worth hiring him to handle (which was one of my questions). He additionally walked me through other solutions for self help and I greatly appreciate the time he took to explain things to me, when he had no monetary interest to do so.  I feel the way he broke things down and the willingness to help is a good indication of how their firm operates. I would seek out their services again if needed.

I know I should let Dominic Review this but.....  Great place from a girls point of view. Nice fun waiting area. Kinda casual sophisticated. Friendly staff, minus the blond receptionist that took pictures of herself while we were there. Dom got a cut and a hot towel, oh yeah and a beer.   They offer drinks and he didn't pay anything extra.  There was an empty chair and the gal let me and Lennon sit and chat while she was cutting. Big salons have a frown for having your company sit and wait.   Sorry for getting girl all over your manly barber place.  You probably will see us there again, I have recommended it to many guys already. and yes I nursed there.  We walked there on a Thursday afternoon. Me Dom and Lennon.

WOW! It is for sure worth the experience. I'm sure you understand it has a beginning salad bar. (Don't fill up on it even if you are extremely impatient) Turn to green and the delicious meets keep coming in gigantic swords that they carve and you uses your little tongs to help it to your plate. Drinks are not included and around $3.00 for soda. Desert is not included either. But the roasted Pineapple is sure a treat.   It was exciting to be served they way they do. Bottom line kinda pricey but the food was great.    We went on a Wednesday about 6ish. 6 adults 1 6 y old.($15) and 2 babies.   and yes I nursed here.  You will see me here again when i feel like dropping  $80 on dinner for 2.

The white pizza is the only reason we ever eat there, and we ALWAYS take out. When we did eat in the dining area, the service was odd. I wasn't sure if  there was a waitstaff or I had to go to the window and pick up my food. The white pizza is where its at.

We love this place. Great for the young boy to find friends and run around before, during and after our food.  The kids choices are not as great as I would want. Full size grown up food is always amazing.  The grilled bbq pizza is good but it is hit or miss on how burnt the bottom is. :(  The farm is a treat. We spend more time on dinner when we are here. Life slows down for us a little.  Get a malted vinilla shake. Sooooo worth it.  Garlic fries/green beans are overloaded with garlicky goodness. Can you tell I am hungry as I type this?   A bit pricy to eat often for us. But we are never disappointed.

the things I liked:  the cart.  it was much smaller than a regular shopping cart, but somehow our  baby carrier fit in it with-wise. * Update ( they got rid of the small carts.) You can fill it up and not spend $300. This has happened to me before at Fry's, and its a bummer. Since they are new, they are the cleanest they will ever be. I have a huge dirty cart handle issue. F&E like most grocery stores have the disinfectant wipes but that grosses me out more for some reason. the steering on the carts was easy like ikea's carts with out the crazy hydroplane maneuver.  The food. Everything F&E brand had very minimal marketing on the packaging which made me feel like i was purchasing it for the quality of food, not how nice the fake prepared image on the front looked.  I have yet to taste it though, ill update when I do. * Update (Prepared food is kinda hit or miss) They have only 1 or maybe 2 brands of the same exact item which makes decisions easy, either you want it or don't, no comparing labels and whatnot. which makes you end up buying less stuff. It also makes for a shorter trip to the grocery store. No more putting off going to the market. Even though I have managed to make myself only shop the outside of the gigantic grocery stores (Produce, meat, dairy bakery) it still takes a long time to trek through the store.  Last grabs. If you needed  they have a small pharmacy aisle grocery brand pet food, and baby care/household aisle. shampoo.... whatever.  One of these things is not like the other... so the chip aisle has F&E brand chips and cookies and all nicely packaged and then at the end were flaming hot Cheeto's? maybe thats the part where they sell local goods. frito-lay is the best we have?  They do not take American express and watch out for the fine print on the coupons. * Update ( They now accept AMEX)  $. Somethings cost much less than at normal markets, and some were the exact same.  they also discount Items that are close to their expiration, so you can go ahead and grab that milk instead of pulling 3 out looking for the latest expiration. same thing with baked goods, meat products and produce.  you will definitely see me there again.

The customer service is probably the best I have ever experienced. Actual genuinely friendly people that are HELPFUL from when you walk in till you walk out.  Food is real good too. (I ignore the fact that some people put wiz on a cheesesteak.) Nice clean place. ...and the cookies. Get a cookie. They are a treat.  They had highchairs for my little one. Even though he deceided he wanted to sit on top of the table.   You will see me there again.  *Update*** downgrade from 5 Stars to 3 Stars   We went there a while back and they changed their sweet potato fries!!! I got some to go and started to snack on them in the car. I immediately noticed they were different than the ones I love, so called them. I asked if they changed their fries and he said yes. I asked if it was permanent or they just ran out or something. He said these are the fries from now on.  Until they go back to the old ones I probably wont go there nearly as often. The fries are that big of a deal. :(  2nd Update*** upgrade from 3 to 4 I has been a while and the sweet potato fries are pretty tasty now. And the service is still as good as ever.

Went on a girls out-ting with 12 or so of us. The bread at the beginning wasn't worth eating.   I had the Rosemary Chicken and potatoes (split! Huge portion) and it was absolutely fantastic. I also had the hazelnut cake and it was a little better than average.   Nice atmosphere and the service for a big group was great.

We have used JT's for several years now for our door and lock needs. He is dependable, fair priced, and knowledgeable. We highly recommend him to anyone in the need!

update: my contribution changed the vote results for kid friendly. :)   I don't know why the header says its not good for kids. Why? Because there isn't a mascot? or flashing lights, tv's, games? Well thank you very much it was a wonderful experience for my family including my 3 year old boy.   Atmosphere was calm and clean. I loved the design and the organic everything. The food and the concept is  outstanding, and very pro kids! Especially ones that you don't want to raise on drive-thru food or that have a particular diet.  Little boy ordered turkey burger, fresh lemonade and we got the tacos.    Its pricy!  But I suppose that's what I get for being in that part of town.

I have had such a great experience with Pet Club in Maricopa. We usually buy our dog, cat, & chicken supplies here with no complaints. Recently we made a big out of the ordinary purchase and each staff member we dealt with including the manager were extremely helpful. I made an error in the item I purchased and they accepted the return with as much courtesy as the purchase.  I am sorry that a previous customer had a negative experience there, however I have yet to have one. Thanks guys!

What fantastic people! Met the general manager and she couldn't be more genuine. Not to mention helpful. I had a question about the place she couldn't answer, and she took my number and said she would find out and let me know. Gosh.

I went in to pay for my parents repairs that Big O said only a new engine would fix (which the problem was a result of Big O servicing, but more on that in their review). I was met by the owner who identified himself as such and began explaining the problem and even having the bad part to show. Seems honest and down to earth. Not at all trying to come up on the fact that I have no idea about car repair, which is what we are all afraid of.   We were referred by a friend and now I want to pass the referral on. Would not hesitate to use them in the future.

The staff needs training and an attitude adjustment. I am currently so frustrated that this review is my only recourse.   When I have a good experience there, I will update my review accordingly.  *update #1 - from 2 stars to 1. The current marketing and membership brochures boasts that there is free child watch included. This is not so. After I purchased a 6 month membership for myself (no refunds)  I was told that my child needs a membership as well to get the "free" child watch.
