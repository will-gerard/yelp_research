The wait staff was excellent. They accommodated special requests beautifully. The Greek Salad was excellent, and the Portobello Pita was outstanding.

A little pricey but worth every penny. The flavor selection is outstanding, and everyone behind the counter is knowledgeable. Indoor seating is sparse, which can be a problem during busy times.

Spent almost $5 on a single butter burger that had a patty so small the bun actually has almost twice as many calories.  Thank you Culver's for helping renew my commitment to home cooked food.
