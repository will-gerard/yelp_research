Fresh mozzerrella, perfectly ripe tomatoes, fine Italian meats, Cerreta candies, ginger sodas, and so many other things make Pane Bianco wonderful.  I also love the ever changing Italian treats that are available for purchase.

This place is a treasure for having little treats from Germany that I really miss.  Jams, hazelnut wafers, dumpling mixes, and tons of little bottles of condiments to pair with sausages.  And oh boy the sausages are good!  There are so many different kinds that it makes it hard to only pick a few.

Oh Pepin, I was not impressed with you being closed on Tuesday even though your restaurant's sign said clearly that you were supposed to be open for business.  After hearing from other people that there were supposed to be salsa dancing lessons on Tuesdays I was excited to check the place out, but when my dance partner and I arrived the doors were locked.  There were no signs indicating that the restaurant would be closed so we decided to venture elsewhere.

This is one of my favorite places to eat!  I haven't found a single thing that I haven't liked here.  The lemon chicken pasta salad is the best and I am completely addicted to it.  The blue corn nachos are also really good and the chicken shwarma is really tasty.  If you have enough room at the end try the raspberry mango cheesecake.

The Guadalupe and McClintock intersection is my favorite area in Valley.  It has Trader Joe's, Changing Hands Bookstore, and Bikram Yoga.  I've been going to Bikram on and off for years.  In 2009 they went through some renovations and now have an amazing heating system.  The instructors are great and the fellow yogis seem really nice.    The weekend 3pm classes are pretty busy so I try to avoid going during those times.  I love the night classes during the week though and always feel amazing after a class.  If you're looking for a place to do yoga you don't need to look any further than Bikram.

Last year my boss got boxes of croissants from here.  The different kinds were distinguished by a different symbols made in icing on top of the pastries.  I was hoping for a pan au chocolat, but the closest they had was chocolate chip (my boss got every flavor).  The croissants were decent, but there was nothing particularly special about them.

Love this local bookstore!  Seriously one of my favorite places to go to in the valley.  Doesn't hurt that it's in a great spot connected to a Wildflower Co and close to a Trader Joe's, but the store itself is so cozy.  I love to walk around this place for hours and go through everything.  It's rare that I don't find something I want even if it's just a 10 minute quick browse.  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because they don't have a computer book section.  Oh well, I'd probably be there all the time if they did.

I've gotten several piercings here and every time they've been great.  This is the only place I would ever get pierced and I recommend it friends all the time.  They have a bunch of jewelry options and I love the sea salt spray that they have.  The staff is very knowledgeable and super nice.  After one of my piercings I went into a pool before I should have.  When I went back because I was having a problem with the piercing they knew exactly what was wrong and how I could treat it.

Crepes, dutch baby pancakes, and fresh squeezed o.j. make a sweet, coma-inducing breakfast.  Plus the bacon is thick and crispy! To top it all off there was maple syrup on the table, no cheap buttersworth on the table for this epic breakfast chow down.  This breakfast was so good that I still dream about the huge, eggy dutch baby that was the size of a pie and covered in cinnamon apple slices.  After leaning back, fully satisfied and possibly too full, I noticed that there were winged pats of butter with waffles painted on the ceiling.  Awesome.

I love this place and highly recommend it.  Darci was my stylist and did a great job.  When I went in the only thing I knew was that I wanted bangs and she helped me figure out the rest.   I've gotten tons of compliments and will def. be going back again.

Stumbled upon this place a while back and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a small clean place that seemed a bit unassuming, but friends and I decided to stop in.  Boy I'm glad we did!  the carrot juice was great, always love a place that offers ginger beer, and the brown chicken stew was sooooo good.  Wish I had room for dessert, but I was pretty stuffed by the end.    One thing I don't recommend is the plantain and avocado spring rolls.  It just becomes a strange flavorless mush in your mouth.  But don't let that dissuade you from trying this place out, because then you'd be missing out.

Last weekend I finally got to eat a crepe from this truck and am STILL thinking about it.  While going through my last walk-through at the Scottsdale Farmer's Market I spotted the truck and instantly became as giddy as a schoolgirl.  So many friends had told me good things and I was excited to finally get my hands on a crepe from TGF.  The Papa K had tons of gooey (Tillamook!) cheese, slices of ham, fresh greens, and mushroom ragout wrapped in a buckwheat crepe.  I would have had another before leaving, but decided to hold back against my better judgment.  Can't wait to find TGF again so I can sample more of their tasty crepes.

Oh Iruna you have captured my heart!  To start my friend and I had the tortilla espanola which had thinly sliced potatoes held together with a mixture of onion, paprika, and egg.  A lemon aioli was drizzled over the thick slice and it was a really great way to start our tapas feast.  The rest of the meal consisted of lovely mild potato/spinach/ cheese puffs served with a romesco sauce, chicken served is a spicy oil with a creamy sauce towards the center and topped with pickled onions * drool *, shrimp coated in spices and garlic, and ,of course, a pitcher of red sangria.   Our waitress was super sweet and very attentive.  Anytime our glasses were getting low she'd swing by our table to refill them.  With such good food and service I'll definitely be going back to Iruna soon.

Nothing I say can do this place justice.  For the last month I've been frequently this place at least a couple of times a week and can never seem to get enough.  White truffle mac n' cheese for $3, delicious bruschetta, specials that sometimes seem a bit odd for the place (tacos at the sandwich/salad place?), mozzarella made on location with mini heirloom tomatoes and balsamic glaze, and so much more.  The daily soups are always rich and tasty.  The fungi sandwich is my new obsession and breakfast....oh the breakfast!  The options seem simply enough - breakfast burritos, omelets, sandwiches, fruit sides, and smoothies, but since this place uses fresh local ingredients something seems so special about these choices.  I love to get the AZ Am Sandwich and add bacon, sausage, AND ham.  So much pig cooked in fluffy eggs!! * swoon *  Anyways, the space is so inviting; bright colors, fresh flowers, and fun art add so much charm.  I wish the hours were longer so I could lounge on the couches and study after work.  Really the hours are my only complaint about this place.  Hopefully they stay open longer (and on weekends) soon.

Before the death heat of Arizona set in a few friends of mine and I went here to celebrate a birthday.  We sat outside which was covered, decorated with plants, and gave us a perfect view of the pastry window.  The drink specials all sounded great, but since I didn't want to look like a boozer I decided to only order one.  I chose a champagne and berry drink which was tasty and unassumingly strong.  Since we had a movie to catch we decided to skip the apps and got straight to business.  One of the ladies got the chicken and veggie quesadilla which was HUGE.  The other two got salads which they beamed about and I got the savory crepes that had roasted chicken, creamed leeks, and mushrooms.  The crepes were is a small bath of basil cream sauce that really brought the dish together.  I'm glad that we had a movie to catch, because I might have licked my plate down otherwise.
