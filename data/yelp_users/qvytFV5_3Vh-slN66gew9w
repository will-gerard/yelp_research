There are a handful of Lenny's Burgers in the Phoenix Metro area, this was the first one I went to and still my favorite. They have Retro design with lots of chrome and neon lights. My first experience was with their original building, burgers are first rate.

Good burgers, decent prices the only downside is cash only. I understand there is a fee associated with taking  cards. But it's 2014.

Read about the cupcake ATM and decided that I needed to try it. Cupcake was OK but not what I expected for almost $5. This was my first Sprinkles cupcake and I know they are pretty much responsible for the gourmet cupcake trend but I've had better. Sweet Daddy Cupcakes are about twice the size for the same price and unlike this cupcake were moist. Won't go back again.

The wait staff was pleasant and very knowledgeable. Was a little pricey as are most places in Scottsdale. Must try the Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus and Yuz, both my date and I raved about it. The BBQ pork loin was also very tasty. I would skip the rice pot, the flavor was very muddled. We also tried the Serrano Chili roll, which as would be imagined was pretty spicy. My only complaint is the chairs, terribly uncomfortable.

I come here at least once a month. Can't go wrong with their Gyro Combo. Traditional Gyro sandwich, fries and a drink for about $8. Fries are always hot, food is fresh and quick.

Yum, this is a gourmet cupcake. Large, moist, covered in frosting and a big variety. If I'm going to spend $4 on a cupcake I shouldn't be able to eat it in a single sitting without getting sick. Buy a box of 4 ($12) and split it with family and friends.

One of the better Burger's you can get at a chain. I've had Five Guys Burger's in 3 different states and a half dozen different establishments. Burgers are made to order with unlimited toppings. The regular size burger and cheeseburger are both double patties, in most cases a single works fine for me. As good as the burgers are the fries. They pack them in and overflow into the bag, well seasoned.
