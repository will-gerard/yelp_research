Well the administration fee is true and now I will not be going back.  You have got to be kidding me.  Like someone stated earlier, I pay a copay every time I go in there and they bill my insurance for anything additional they do.  This is total BS.  I thought I was going to the doctor not a gym.  The Doctors are good there, but it is soooo slow.  If you have a 10am appointment, don't expect to get in before at least 10:30am.  I called and I was told this fee was to offset the cost of the Lab, EMR and Patient Portal cost.  I'm not sure what Lab they are referring to because every time I have blood drawn they send it off to some place called LabCorp.  Isn't this the cost of doing business?  So should I start deducting a set amount for the employees that work for me for the cost of internet and the payroll system we use?  I don't think so.

This place is awesome. Kind of in a weird spot but that's OK, I think if it was, there would be a lot  more traffic.  Awesome decor, atmosphere and patio. Nutella cheese cake is the the bomb. Only negative is that it's very small but I think that kind of adds to its appeal.

Let's start with that I love this place.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is that there is a serious lack of staff. It's either not enough wait staff or not enough cooking staff. I'm not really sure. This place is always packed. It's always a minimum 20 minute wait to get seated and then when you're seated, it takes another 10 to get your drink and then another 10 for your order.   Personally they need to add wait staff. They are working far too many tables per waiter/waitress. If they added 2 to a shift, they could churn people in and out of here. Bus boys wouldn't hurt either.   Overall great food, great location and great setting but too understaffed for the amount of business they get.

Great little spot. They have a nice house hot sauce that sweet and hot. Burritos are really good. Good selection of Mexican beers and glass bottle soda.
