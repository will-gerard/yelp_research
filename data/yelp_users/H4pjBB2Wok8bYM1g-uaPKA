The atmosphere is adorable and with a group of moms and babies, we expected to enjoy a nice brunch after playing at the Idea Museum. However, the owners (the older woman especially) were incredibly rude. They acted as if it was the world's biggest inconvenience to have a handful of toddlers in their little abode. After ordering, we immediately sat outside to get out of there way since it was clear they weren't happy we were there. A couple of plates (sandwiches/salad) came out over 20 minutes after the other meals were served. The sandwiches were very basic and plain, though the drinks (a smoothie and latte) were good. I will never again step foot in this establishment and to be quite honest, I'm surprised they're still in business after such awful service and less than stellar food.

This place is seriously incredible!!   The wait use to be really long (sometimes over an hour), especially during happy hour or on the weekends. It's since gotten better with the entire patio open for meals. However, I'd still expect to wait at least 15-20 minutes minimum during their peak times. That said, the food and beer is amazing!! I love the Hawaiian chicken burger the best, while my husband prefers the Good Morning burger. The servers are always great and the atmosphere is laid back. The one thing that could make this brewery even better is if they offered wine as well.
