I LOVE OYSTERS! My friends took me here and seriously didn't think it could possibly be that great, it's a bar that seats probaly less than 20 people at a time and people still wait at the red ropes hoping to be seated.  We just stand there and stare at the while they eat.  The food was AMAZING... I haven't gone back and it's been months and I still dream about it.  Pan roast and clam chowder, share with someone because it's huge.  We took the leftovers back to the hotel and I actually tried to hide it in the fridge so no one else eats it.  DROOLINGGGGGG...

Worst steak burrito, ever.  Worst $9 spent. Barely any meat. All I tasted was the tortilla. The meat was dry, but what can you expect from an airport restaurant? I should have ate burger king. Yuck.

I'm pretty obsessed with pizza, especially unique personal pizzas. My boyfriend and I made a stop here on the way to Sedona - Thanks to the help of my fellow yelpers.  Unlike many of the businesses we saw in the area, this restaurant was busy! I really liked the modern design, decor, and classy feel of the Parlor.   We ordered the Duck club and made our own pizza. The pizza was really delicious!  The ingredients were so fresh, and I love the rich taste of the oils and cheesy crust.  I almost ordered one for take out! 5 stars for food, but 4 stars for service. The waitress gave us attitude when we tried redeeming our free yelp desserts, and wasn't too friendly to us throughout our visit.  Luckily the food was superb!    I would definitely come back if I'm ever back in the area.

Really accommodating.  They seating our large group of about 16 with ease.  They took 5 minutes to pull some tables together and quickly served us.  Lunch menu is a great deal.  $8.99 with soup and rice. The food was great dispite some of the reviews I read on Yelp.  No one in our party complained about their food.  I ordered their chicken pad thai, the portion size was very generous and I requested spicy, and the spice kicked my butt!  I really liked the restaurant setting and decor, everything is very classy.

Place had no business, we came in with a group of 10 and they couldn't seat a group larger than 8. We told them to split our group in half but they still didn't know how to do it. Annoying! Their menu wasnt impressive either. They basically turned away some good business without hesitating. Terrible management.

Their suite is amazing.  The balcony view is definitely top notch, overlooking the belagio water show and the Paris tower.  I'd defintely stay here again in the future!

NO STARS.  Their check-in staff is beyond RUDE.  I wish I took the little miserable Filipino lady's name before I left.  Also the miserable fat lady that accompanied her.  They treated every customer terribly.  I couldn't believe Delta Airlines allowed this type of service.  Their "e-confirmation check-in" service is flawed. Everyone that checked in on their mobile devices and used their economically friendly way of checking in by showing their phones instead of using a physical ticket had their tickets CANCELED! I was with a few other customers that had the same issue.  We were one hour early, but because they didn't know how to help us, it led to automatic cancellations.  That wasn't the bad part. It was their customer service, or lack of.  The lady at the desk was beyond rude.  She did not offer any solutions or even a slight sign of sympathy or concern.  The ticketing issue was their fault, and they had plenty of time to help at least 4 other people, but chose not to.  This led to customers sleeping at the airport terminals for hours hoping for an opening on the next few flights.  The experience was unreal.  I fly through this airport for business and vacationing numerous times a year and have never experienced this type of horror.  When I refused to walk away after they told me my ticket was canceled they threatened to call security.  I literally walked away in tears of frustration and watched them do the same to the other people that were robbed.  Their flight crew were great though.  They tried their best to squeeze me on a flight and the girl that worked at the gate was very sweet and professional to everyone bombarding her with questions.

The pizza here was tasty, but I did wish the crust wasn't so soggy/oily.  I like my crust more crispy, at least where I can pick up a slice with one hand without the slice falling apart.    I do have to mention that the service as excellent and the restaurant itself had nice decor and was very clean.    Recommendations:  Quattro and Totto  The complimentary dessert was also a nice simple treat :)  I think I would come back, and just simply ask them to keep mine in the oven a little longer.
