The only thing worthy of a taste was they had a bean dip that actually some jalepeno spice. Other than that nothing was worth eating. Talk about bland no flavor mx. food this is it. If all u want is cheap this is your place. Might as well eat at Filbertos.

Thought was supposed to be HOT, but was'nt more like tooo sweet!!! I got the Fireman carnita burrito really was disappointed so far Arizona's Mexican foods is way to BLAND and wife has'nt found any she likes!!! The girl that took my order was nice and polite and the carnita meat tasted good but that's all !!! my 2 star rating is on the high side!!!

Was close to the airport so I chose this one. They had everything ready for us. A good truck, Was like new. Would recommend Penske for your moves. Just call the number from website and they give you better discounts than whats on website. Was happy with price.

Was not impressed! the bun and fries were good! The beans and slaw were not very good!!! The bbq meat was ok but not anywhere near as good as Kansas City bbq. The man vs Food review was way off!!!

Was a bit dissapointed after reading reviews here! I had the fijitas, wife had tacos. Didnt think the inferno  (green hatch chili)was all that hot!!! The Taco meat was not spiced bland. Best part of the meal was the bean dip and chips even the salsa was nothing great!!! At least the beer was cold   ut at 13.00 a pitcher it better be!!!

Well I did find a mexican restraunt in Phoenix that wasnt that bland senoran tasteless food.  Las Glorias was some of the best I have had anywhere in the country...too bad I found it when moving out of Phoenix area. Easy 5 stars.

The food was good as well as the service. By making my own Hot sauce was able to get the hotness I like!!! Chips were fresh and great. The taco on the bussiness mans plate was top notch! Only thing that wasnt  top notch was the decor and the seating space.

If you want some spicy food in AZ. This is about as good as it gets. The server/bartender was great. Very funny guy and very quick. I enjoyed all of what I ate and was on the hot side compared to the Baja bland at most places. The price is not cheap and not a lot of seating so I understand wait lines at primetimes.

GREAT!!! The meat is so fresh and you dont have any preservatives. They dont feed you meats from animals that were fed with steroids and old animal parts like the common grocery store!!! EXCELENT!!!  WILL BE BACK!
