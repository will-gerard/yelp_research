The beds were comfortable. That's about the only thing good I can say about this hotel. They have a pool, a jacuzzi, and a workout room. I guess those are good things I can say too. That's pretty much it.  We reserved a single bed room, and got a room with two beds. When we asked at the desk, they simply moved us to a different room, also with two beds. "Well, we're all booked up," we were told. "The room we gave you will have to do," the lady said as if she was doing us a favor.   The staff isn't so great. they all seem to live in the suburbs and only come into the city to work. They know nothing about the area at all, and they don't have a concierge on duty so getting helpful suggestions on where to go or what to do, even in the area directly around the hotel, is not going to happen. When asked about where to go to eat, the lady behind the counter just looked at us and pointed toward the in-house restaurant (which has decent service but sub-par food). When asked about museums and other attractions in the area, a different lady pointed toward the rack of brochures. After looking at some of the brochures and asking about a specific attraction, we were told, "I don't know. I don't live in the city." At this point, we just left the staff alone and thanked the gods for Yelp.  It was a roof over our heads. It is located near many of the places we ended up checking out. It is not a great hotel.

The lady at the Phoenix Visitors Center highly suggested we check this place out. They have a few of the basic stores you are likely to find in any mall, indoor our outside, within the US. They have a bunch of places that sell apparently artist-made gifts and clothing, but it is for the most part pretty kitschy (not in a good way though). They have a few restaurants including a Hooters. Overall, it seems it is nothing to write home about and certainly isn't a tourist destination.

I hadn't been to a T.G.I. Fridays in years before I heard about this place on a recent trip to Phoenix.  It's located inside Chase Field, where the Arizona Diamondbacks play, but it has its own separate entry so you don't need a ticket to the game to get in here during a game. You can, however, see into the park from much of the restaurant. This was cool.  The place looks like any other Fridays, but a little nicer. It has a lot of baseball decor on the walls instead of the typical Fridays bric-a-brac and large TVs to watch games on. Plus, it has large windows that let you see into the park. You can't see the field from many of the seats, but looking in at the crown is fun.   I was looking forward to stopping at a T.G.I. Fridays to try some of the food featured on that Food Network show, but during games they have a limited menu that excludes a lot of the good stuff including most if not all of the Food network recipes. That was kind of a bummer.   On the plus side, the food we got was good. It was hot. The service was good and friendly. The beer was cold. We could see into Chase Field.  The server tells me that you can make reservations for the tables outside in the park and inside by the windows for a reasonable price, and half of that price is credited in food. It doesn't seem like a bad deal, and would be worth checking out for a game or an off night, especially for an avid baseball fan.

This place is a callback to days gone by. It is also one of the only places open for a late lunch in this area. They have great cold sandwiches, piled high with meat. Their split pea soup is some of the best I've had in a long time. The servers in their cute little uniforms are good too. Plus, you can't really beat the prices.   Plus, they have all the old-timey soda fountain creations. I got a chocolate phosphate! A chocolate phosphate! Yum. My only complaint is that it was a little low on the chocolate.   In addition to food, this place has a large vintage type shop. We didn't really peruse the shop much, but it looked like they have a bunch of great stuff at good prices. Check it out.

Being from a large city, I have experienced great Mexican fare, and I would have thought that being so close to Mexico and having a large Mexican population, there would have been good Mexican food around here. That may be true, but I have to be honest and say that this place leaves much, possibly too much, to be desired in the realm of awesome eats.  Maybe it's that I walked into this restaurant with too high expectations that they were unable to live up to. Maybe the food wasn't that good. It is possible that both are correct. I am thinking the second statement was more accurate than the first.  I had the combo plate with twp tacos and an enchilada. I asked for steak tacos. I got tacos with thin strands of steak, similar top barbacoa, that weren't very flavorful and were somewhat dry.  The enchilada was covered in a kinda bland mole.  Service was decent. The food was passable, but not very good.

This place is ok. It's not great or even all that good, but it's ok.   They do have a decent meat counter, but there doesn't seem to be someone that is regularly there to help clients, at least not a true butcher or anyone that is really all that knowledgeable on the meat. There are good sales from time to time, but I found many of their prices to be a little (some more than a little) high.   They do have many of the items that you may find yourself needing in a pinch.

As we rode in the back seat of the car down a street in Buckeye that I can't remember the name of, I saw a bunch of neon glowing around a building in the distance.  I asked the man driving, "What's that off in the distance there?"  He looked slightly confused for a second. "With all the neon?"  The neon was pretty much the only thing you could see across the dark desert night. "Yes."  "That's a Sonic," he said.  Now, I live in Chicago. I see commercials near everyday for Sonic, but there aren't any within 100 miles of here. Why they torture Chicagoans with images of yummy food, tasty drinks, and ice cream desserts that we would have to travel for hours upon hours to get, I know not. Here was my chance though. I could finally have some Sonic. I asked him to stop there, and he did.  It's a 50s-inspired drive-in! I don't see too many drive-ins around anymore. You pull into a spot next to a menu with a speakerbox. You place your order. A person who works there brings it out to you on a special tray that goes over your window. Very cool.  We got burgers and a corndog and sundaes and other stuff too. It was all good. The service was good. I greatly enjoyed my first Sonic experience, and I look forward to getting to one again on future travels.

Sage is an antique shop. Sage is an artist-made jewelry store. Sage sells a lot of cool stuff that was originally parts of buildings that no longer exist in parts of the world you may not have ever been. If you're looking to refurbish your home or just get some cool interesting home decor items, this is the place to go.   The neat-o architectural salvage stuff comes from places all over the world. You can recycle the stuff into your home or building (though it's not so green as it often comes from Belgium or other far off places).  The owner tells me that she gets a line around the block whenever she gets a new crate of salvaged stuff in. You should give her a call to find out when the next batch is due as you'll find things here that you aren't likely to find anywhere else.   The artist-made jewelry is also very cool and unique. She sells items by jewelry creators in France and around the US. This too is stuff you are not likely to find anywhere else.   All in all, it's worth checking out if even for a browse, and you arelikely to find at least something interesting.

Holy Panini! This place makes a good sandwich!   This dimly lit restaurant and bar has cool tables with drawings beneath resin, and cool art on the walls (currently various animals and such in a somewhat pixelated style). It's a cool comfortable environment that we like a lot.   The food was great. I got a Cuban panini with the orzo salad. It was great. It was also too large to eat in one sitting. I had to take half of it back to our hotel to finish it the next day. Her sandwich was really good too. It was also too big for her, and we had to bring it back to the hotel to happily devour the next day. Damn you Carly's for stopping us from checking out one of the other great little restaurants in Phoenix for lunch the next day due to your very good too-large-for-one sandwiches.  The service was slightly lacking. This was due to the fact that our cool Aussie server was, we think, the only one working that night. I can't fault him on the slower than hoped for service due to that fact, but it would have been great if they had another person on staff to help alleviate that problem.  Our only real complaint was the music that was being performed. We walked in happy and upbeat, but wanted to shoot ourselves in the face half way through our visit due to the sad and depressing music being performed. The lady singing had a great voice, and the guitar-playing man played his instrument well, but the music was really really really depressing. It was all of our family and friends had just died depressing. It was both of us had just lost our jobs and home depressing. It was really really really really depressing. Walking by other nights, we had noticed music that wasn't depressing at all being played by different performers though, so maybe we just hit the place on a bad night.   Overall, it was cool decor, great food, decent service all things considered, and sad sad sad music on the night we were there. Check this place out.

Many of the businesses in this area of the city are converted houses and Made is what started it all. It is my understanding that they got the idea of buying dilapidated houses, fixing them up real nice, and turning them into neat little shops, restaurants, and bars. Kudos indeed!  Made itself sells unique books, hand-made and other cool cards, cool artist-made jewelry, some artist-made and small label clothing, and art from local artists. The people who work there also know the area really well, and are more than happy to suggest other businesses in the area.

This is a great place. My fiance and I decided that if we lived anywhere close to Phoenix, we would be there all the time, probably almost every day. Their website boasts 80+ beers, 20 wines, 3 sakes, 10+ organic brews & wines, and off-the-grid wine. They live up to their boasting.   Keep in mind that she and I could be considered to be beer snobs crossed with beer adventurists. The Lost Leaf filled our need for cool microbrews that we like a lot as well as cool stuff we had never had. The bartender with very knowledgeable too, which is always a plus in a place like this.   They have great art on the walls, most of which I think is for sale. They often have events going on as well. When we were there, a figure drawing event was happening. They also have a poetry open mic, live music, a DJ, and a bunch of other stuff.   It's definitely worth checking out.

The coffee is quite good.  The Chai Explosion was yummy and cold.   The coffee drinks were great.  The decor makes this place look like a corporate coffee entity, but it isn't.  They sometimes host events like the Downtown Phoenix Poetry Slam (which we saw on a night when it was a poetry open mike, and it wasn't all that good, but we have heard good things about it when it is an actual slam).  The coffee is actually fair trade. So, when you drink it, you can rest assured that the people who grew it were compensated fairly for their work. This is a good thing.

Mmm... breakfast. This is one of the only chain restaurants we went to on our trip to Arizona, but they don't have anything quite like this in Chicago, and I'll tell you that this was one of the places that made our trip worthwhile.  First Watch has great stuff for breakfast. It's somewhat Southwestern-inspired. There were many items on the menu like what I decided on, the Bacado. It was an omelet with bacon and avocado.  Yum. The potatoes it came with had a little bit of spice. Yum. The girl had sourdough french toast. Yum!  The service was good. The food was good. It was inexpensive. We got a good breakfast with coffee and juice and were out of there into downtown Phoenix for less than $30.

Flavor? Nope.  The pizza was a bit larger than I expected, and that would generally be a good thing, but there was almost no flavor art all.  I am originally from Chicago, and I therefore come with reasonably high standards when it comes to what makes a quality pizza. This place didn't come anywhere near meeting any of them. The sauce was really bland. The sausage was in very small pieces on the pizza, and it had virtually no flavor. The parmesan and Chile flakes were at the counter to be taken to your table, but I didn't notice that they were there until I was done eating.  The service was pretty decent.

After suggestions from the ladies at Made, Bunky Boutique, and Sage, we had to check out Palatte. One word: WOW!!   It's an old house converted into a restaurant with a gorgeous, large outdoor eating area. The staff is friendly, courteous, and more than willing to offer up suggestions for and explanations of things on the menu.   You order at a little window into the kitchen inside the house, and they bring your food out to you. The food id good. Correction: The food is great.  Correction of the correction: The food is really freakin' awesome.   We just wish we could have made it back here to try the lunch before we had to head back home.

Bunky is a great little shop that you probably wouldn't find unless you were looking for it specifically, but would be happy to have found if you did. The owner Rachel (who is super super cute, more than willing to answer questions and make suggestions, and is very knowledgeable about the area) stocks her store with a lot of small label clothing (mostly for women), some cool artist-made jewelry, cool fedoras and trilbys and other hats, and purses including HOBO brand.   There is a huge rack of cool t-shirts too including kid robot which I think is pretty cool.   Some of the pricing may seem a little high, but if you found a lot of the stuff she sells elsewhere, you'd realize her pricing is really good. If you're in the area for First Friday or happen by another time, give this place a try.

We had the IT  Combo sandwich, a combination Italian Beef and Sausage. It was great. I especially liked the au jus that came with the sandwich so one could dip it if they liked. Yum.  They have 20something taps of draft beer, all craft beer as opposed to massbrews, I think. It's a pretty good selection indeed.I had the hoppy cider. i didn't like it at first, ut it grew on me pretty quickly. I liked it a lot by the end of the pint. It's good stuff.   My only problem was the bad service. The service was pretty darn terrible, bur thwe food was really good, and the beer selection is great.

This place is great. It's part coffee shop (see reviews of The Coffee Conspiracy), part art gallery, part book shop, part artist-made jewelry shop, part clothing store, and parts of a bunch of other things all in one tiny house turned shop. Most everything is hand-made/painted/drawn. They have some cool stuff here that you won't find anywhere else in the world, and some great things for gifts for entire family. Check this place out for sure.

This looks like it will be a pretty darn cool place once it opens. During our stay in Phoenix, we saw a video installation projected on a few of the windows facing the street, and a live band performing outside during Third Friday festivities. I just wish this place was actually open and complete in the way that Eric P. said it will be shortly. It is definitely something to look forward to checking out the next time the fiance and I are in Phoenix.

This is the coffee place located inside Conspire. John, the owner and barista, is super friendly, knows a lot about the area, and makes a great cup of coffee on top of it all. The Chai Latte is superfantastic too. He actually makes it from scratch, mixing all the ingredients. It's not the regular store-bought or normal coffeehouse stuff. It could maybe have a bit less nutmeg though.

This place has great produce at great prices. They have a large  natural and organic foods selection. The meat department and deli are great.  The best part is that the customer service is great. The staff here is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.   The better best part may be the prices. Though some may be just a tad high, as a fellow that is used to shopping at Whole Foods for very similar products and paying a lot for them, the prices here are reasonable.

I have been wanting to take a pedi-cab for a while, but haven't had the chace or a reason. Tonight, celebrating my recent engagement, my fiance and I went to Friday's Front Row at Chase Field. As we went in, there was one particularly interesting pedi-cab driver aggressively looking for business. When we were done with dinner, a while after the game let out, he was there, and we decided to let him take us for a ride back to our hotel.   This is where things got interesting.   He drove us in circles along the front of the ballpark, almost running us into polls and pedestrians multiple times. We should have stopped him and removed ourselves from potential danger then, but for some reason we didn't. Maybe it was my penchant for putting my life in danger. I'm not sure. he then started off on the road to the hotel. The problem was that he wasn't heading to our hotel. We tried to explain to thim multiple times where he should be heading. "Roosevelt and Central," we told him. "The Best Western on Central," we said. He continued in the wrong direction spouting something about Hollywood.   Finally, after a half dozen close calls and a few drops off curbs, we got him heading the right way. What seemed to be a personality to match his bright yellow shirt and pedi-cab seemed to be going from Jeckyll to Hyde. He was becoming more manic, talking faster, harder to understand. We got to 5th St. and made him oull over. We figured a beer at Lost Leaf was called for after a long day and a dozen near death experiences over the span of less than ten minutes.   He had told us when we got in the cab initially that it was all donation-based and that he would take us anywhere we wanted to go for $1 each. We got out of the pedi-cab and gave the guy $10. He turned pretty irate. He demanded that we give him at least $25 due to the distance he had to travel (what should have been less than a mile). When we didn't he started to get in my fiance's face who promptly told him to back off and go away. He did.   Unfortunately, he went off with my favorite lighter.   Most pedi-cab drivers, I imagine, are cool people who aren't completely insane, but do avoid this particular company or at least this particular driver.

Rise up is "an organization that seeks to empower, provide opportunity, and hope, for those living in difficult circumstances." Rise Up has cool t-shirts. They have a specific Rise Up brand with very cool designs, and the shop also sells OBEY.   I very much like that a portion of the proceeds for all sales at this store, as well as an additional portion of Rise Up branded merchandise goes to help people around the world and specifically in the Phoenix area and around Arizona.  We very much liked the art on the walls at Rise Up too. It is currently by a Phoenix artist named Michael David Little. Cool cool images. We liked it so much in fact, that when we found out that the painting we especially liked on the wall at Rise Up was already sold, we found out where his studio is, went there, and purchased a piece right off the wall there.

Instead of giving me what I ordered, the guy behind the counter gave me a combo including more chicken tenders than I asked for. He also informed me that they were out of BBQ sauce. Plus, their soda fountain was all kinds of messed up. Not cool.

Tessie (Tessy?) was our server, and she pretty much ignored us, Fun.  The onion rings were good, a light crispy batter with thinly cut onion. Nice.  The Pulled Pork Sandwiches were pretty unexciting. Mine was on the dry side, and my dining partner says that she did not get enough sauce. Further, yjr Sweet Heat sauce doesn't have a lot of flavor, only heat.   Their Mac n Cheese had corn in it. Don't get me wrong, I like corn, but I do not eat GMO corn and not telling me that corn is in a dish is not cool.

The wings are jumbo, for real jumbo, and they're currently on special at 35 cents each which is pretty cheap/ They also taste good. I like. the problem was (mostly) the service. Brandon was the server, and he was pretty terrible.  We had the potato skins to start. They had all the appropriate toppings, but there was way too little of the toppings on the skins. There was cheese. There was bacon. There was other stuff. There wasn't much of any of it. Bummer.  I ordered a coke. The person I was with ordered a rum and coke. At this point, Brandon asked if she had meant a Jack Daniels and coke. He seemed completely flummoxed when we explained that Jack Daniels is not rum. Bacardi, for example, is indeed rum. When the drinks came, the soda was flat. Brandon immediately replaced mine upon my mentioning the flatness of the soda, but didn't do anything with the mixed drink.  Mt wings came. It was supposed to be 6 medium (sort of a standard buffalo wing sauce) and 6 pineapple teriyaki. The medium actually came as mild. There was no discernable sauce on the medium wings. The manager was called over, and she fixed my sauceless wings, the overcooked french fries of my dining partner, and my dining partner's drink.  Job well done.   Overall, this was a 1 star experoemce. I gave it 2 because the manager was great,

They do more than just brakes, hence the "plus" in the name of the place. My mom had to bring her car in because she ran over an errant truck tire on I-17 bumping the underside of her SUV and she wanted to make sure that nothing got all screwed up because of the bang.   It turns out the power steering pump was damaged and was leaking. She had the pump replaced, and while they were at it she had them replace the struts and shocks, and she had something else done too, but I honestly don't remember what.   Since she was having multiple services performed, an all day affair, the store manager played shuttle driver, gave my mother and I a ride to her house then picked us back up again to pick up the vehicle when it was ready later that afternoon. Tip is a pretty cool guy.  We got great customer service here. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I note that they were also honest. I was looking out for my mother, but I didn't have to look too hard to see that they weren't taking her for a ride (except for the shuttle home and back).

I am originally from Chicago, and I have discovered that a good Italian Beef sandwich is very hard to come by outside of the Chicago area. Enter Portillo's a Chicago-based restaurant. I love the Beef and Cheddar Croissant. It is what I order from Portillo's almost every time I am in one of their restaurants when I am back home, and it wAs a very pleasant surprise to find a Portillo's in the desert!  The food is great and the service is pretty good. I was thrown off a tad when i ordered my sandwich sweet and wet, a term that most Chicagoans would easily understand, and the young lady behind the cash register looked at me like I was crazy. Fortunately, I was able to translate the lingo into layman's terms pretty easily, and it got me one of the best Beef and Cheddar Croissants that I have had.

This plane has to do I rinks.  There could be free skating on one wild berry and ice hockey on the other. With the hockey rink being divided into three smaller rinks horrible kids teens to play and practice. If I lived in the Phoenix area, and had a child that was interested in playing hockey, or I was interested in playing hockey myself, this place would be fantastic.
