Delicious bagels, awesome staff, friendly owner. I loved the special cranberry/citrus cream cheese they had around the holidays last year, I hope it comes back around this year!

this macaroni grill location has been closed down. i worked for the company for a few years and most of the staff knew it was coming. a menu overhaul and an AWESOME new general manager came in a few months before the close, which made me have a little hope; however it seems that word had gotten out that the ahwatukee location wasn't particularly great. there are plenty of other valley locations that seem to have quite a high volume of customers; arrowhead, mesa, and golddust (scottsdale). i would have loved to transfer but too much of a drive for me! the spaghetti bolognese will always be my favorite. if they ever bring back the panna cotta, be sure to try it!

STAY AWAY  poor service, but i don't blame the server herself. my boyfriend and i dined in a few months ago and SO MANY things went wrong. it was a weekday and they were terribly understaffed. it took about 15 minutes for our out-of-breath waitress to come get our drink orders. she was trying her best, however it was clear that she had way too many tables to take care of. an expo took our food out, and my salad had no dressing! nobody was to be found to ask for some dressing... or refills... i kindly asked the host to speak to a manager, and with an attitude he said the manager was too busy to come talk to us.  mediocre food, but i wouldn't really expect more from an applebees

I love living here. On-site dog park is super convenient. The grounds are always well-kept, maintenance responds to requests in a timely manner, office staff is friendly, and I feel very safe living here. I love that there are rarely large groups at the pool so it's quiet and relaxing.

This place is the best!!!!!! Lots of different local brews and guest brews. But I usually stick with Raj. Ask for cheese with the pretzels. Alex the server is our favorite!

Awkward service. Food tastes nasty. Hardly felt like A/C was on in the middle of a Phoenix summer's day.

this is my all-time favorite restaurant. i go every year for my birthday and order the filet.  the service is always phenomenal! our most recent waitress was from california (i don't remember her name) but she made small talk with us and seemed genuinely glad to be taking care of us. a few of the line cooks i had previously worked with at romano's maraconi grill (which has since closed down) were cooking. she kindly walked me up to the line to say hi! the filet is always cooked to perfection (or should i say not-so-cooked; i like mine still mooing) and be sure to add the green bean side for only $5. they're cinnamon-sweet! i usually go for the key lime pie as dessert, but recently i chose the creme brulee cheesecake. heaven in my mouth.

i used to get gas here because of the promotions. a while back they were giving away cookies with the purchase of however many gallons. i went in to pay in cash and retrieve my cookie, and i found they were no longer running the promotion. the clerk rudely told me "no but feel free to actually pay for a cookie".... jerk not going back now!

I love how clean it is in here. Large selection of productions and shelves are always stocked. One guy working is really friendly and sometimes gives free energy drinks!!!

Awesome customer service. They'll take appointments and get you in on time! Fair prices and they do a quality job. Large selection of gel colors and they just added several more options! One time I wasn't satisfied with my full set and Simon took me back in, gave me a new set free of charge.

Delicious and fresh! The owners are very friendly. The past two times I've gone they've thrown in extra slices of pizza or complementary garlic sticks. Lots of beer on tap too.

Dare I say it... Better than Krispy Kreme! They have the fluffiest and freshest pastries. I'm so happy they've opened a Bosa in Ahwatukee.

Bad service. Rude mgmt (Wyatt). You'd be better off going to Four Peaks next door.  Burger was pink so we asked for a new one. Ignored my 3 different servers over the course of 20 minutes. They did bring a new burger... After we waited for a while and at this point we just wanted to leave. The waters were empty the majority of the time. Manager came out and was not accommodating about the poor service. He was argumentative and raised his voice. We brought up the point that several different staff members had stopped by so there may have been a lapse in communication. He responded "we are a team here and that's how all restaurants work. We brought you a new burger so what else do you need."
