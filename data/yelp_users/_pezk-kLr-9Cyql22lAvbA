Absolute Rock Stars at this location. Had a blowout on my boat trailer and brought the wheel and shredded tire to this location just before closing and they went out of their way to get me in and out in no time. These guys are fantastic!

Easily my favorite place to relax in Old Town. Great atmosphere, great food, and quality drinks. Joel, the Manager always makes sure everything is perfect. I love the Shrimp ceviche (wish they still served it in a coconut) and the fish tacos.

Was excited to see this place open within walking distance of my apartment and decided to check it out. First thing you notice (or not notice) is the entrance. A side door, hardly marketed and hard to see. Once inside we were greeted by a server who informed us we could sit wherever we liked. We chose a booth in the corner of the raised area. There was a karaoke dj and a few large groups obviously there for the karaoke. The atmosphere was dark and stale. I ordered spring rolls and a regular steak pho. The rolls were nothing but filler and a few shreds of pork and a shrimp or two. They literally stuck to the plate. The pho came and my disappointment grew as I discovered 4 or less pieces of actual meat and far too few noodles to even out the amount of broth. Overall a disappointment. Would have rated one star but our server was prompt and friendly.
