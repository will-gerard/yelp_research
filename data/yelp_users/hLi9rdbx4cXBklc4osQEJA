I have not been to a " Barber " in a long time due to the unprofessionism some show.....Vera did an awesome job a staying on task light conversation and love the little extras.... Straight razor shaved neck and side burns, vacuumed clippers (no hair on clothing...YES), and electric shoulder massage after cut............$14 what a bargain... would have given 5 stars but ...$.50 charge to use debit or credit???? May sound petty but..... I will definitely be back in 4-6 weeks!!!

My wife and I frequent this local bar very often as it is close to home and Happy Hour prices are nicely done..... Always great service.. we usually sit on the patio... great place to go and hang out for a few after work, or on a lazy weekend afternoon.....had the Mediterranean Wrap with Fresh steamed Veggies( don't laugh we're on a fitness program) it was very good for splitting and was fresh and pleasantly tasting... goes to prove you can find healthy food at a local bar lol..............  Been going here off and on for 12 years wont stop!!!

I have been going here for over 10 yrs, seen the place remodeled 3-4 times, and 3 karaoke hosts.....I love the neighborhood feel of the bar the friendly and surly staff, the atmosphere is what it is a BAR and GRILL decent food decent prices and fun in the air, Sherry and Misty the bartenders i see most are awesome and have been there forever, they remeber and care greatly for their regulars and try to make new ones quick, but the Crown Jewel of this place is Wed-Sat nights, KARAOKE BY BRAD, He has been here for past 3 years and continues to have the newest music available for the group of singers, No favoritism here he has alot of regulars but no one gets preference in line up, and you always know whos up next by the TV screens that show the next 4-6 in the line up, his sound sytem and professionalism is superior my wife is a Karaoke Junkie and loves this place "The Shellie Show"...  Also Happy Hour here is great too LOW prices on Domestics 11-7 daily   yes 11-7 ....  Stop by  I did still going since 2001

My wife and I dined here Wed 3/20/13. I want to say my wife lost her diamond wedding band when she took it off a moment. Her diamond engagement ring was at Jewelers getting blinged, I found the ring had it bonded to the diamond ring ......(she thought lost forever very upset) Back to Oreganos, our Server was awesome, Pablo Picasso Salad fresh, amazing mix of spices and vegs, Big Rig w/chix a grat stand by.... as we shared our server ( Forgive me think was Mike) catered to our every need, you don't get service like this at some fine dining places. Well time came to show my wife her "new ring" I decided to propose to my awesome wife got down on the one knee and Pow Popped the question..... She ws amazed by the ring, but not without the round of ceremony applause would it have been complete.... With out the atmosphere, awesome food, service, and manager.... Oh yeah... The manger I believehis name was Dennis ... Comped our check.. Told him it was unnecessary as we are already Married lol ... He insisted thanked us for choosing Oreganos for our special night ..... GUEST FOR LIFE!!!!!

Walked in for 1st time and was taken in 5 mins as promised, Topaz cut my hair and was light on conversation and pleasant, she really was very conversational and did an awesome job on my hair, my wife said " Go back to her its the best your hair has been cut in years..."   Guess I'll be back the boss spoke LOL

This place has the absolute worst customer service I have ever experianced... no one seems to be able to answer a question without some condition.. checking out 1 out of 35 cashier and literally 20 ppl in line and employees behind registers leaning on counters.. 20 minutes in line ... To talk to and associates it does not even smile or even give you eye contact

I cant give this no stars but would..... Stay away... FYI I hate bashing a place I waas in this business for years but...... Time for a reboot

Again top notch British fare ven a little store where you can buy the British goods you miss so much from home this is a little gem at 16th Street and Bell. You should not miss breakfast Saturdays and Sundays are awesome you gotta do it for a traditional English Brekkie

Frys is a staple in the Phoenix Metro Area .. This store has changed and always the best prices and incentives around.... Winco though not to far away dn offer gas points or the service Fry's offers....  Though not my favorite location never an issue with service or prices...

A needed venue on the West Side... Owner very guest oriented... She gets it.... Great fans great prices great crowds place is very clean also she does not spare on the talent the bands that are there are known and very good not to mention my favorite night of the week Monday and meatloaf which is awesome for $7.95.... Again the service is a bit crazy on Fridays and Saturday nights for what you can you expect when its wall to wall people.. Anybody who complains about it is a total idiot.... I look forward to Fridays and Saturdays in finding out who's playing

Not your typical financial organization they treat customers as other financial institution should. Recently switched my accounts over here from a larger institutions by the recommendation of another Nelson Lozano went above and beyond to help my wife and I get our business straight there . It's great when you walk into someplace you may have only been a few times and then remember your name without looking at the computer we finally found a home bank

I love the atmosphere ... No intimidation from power lifters and not a place to feel uneasy no matter what your body type.... Also Chris who is the trainer there is awesome he fine tuned a workout program for me based on what I wanted to accomplish also pushing me to develop my core with this workout again it is not a one on one situation will give you the workout its up to you that point after to follow through with the work out on your own using your inner self to do so it is work out that's worked for me over the past few weeks I really hard core started trying to get into shape .... The atmosphere of this gym makes all the difference in the world

Brad is a consummate professional his rotation is completely fair and he holds the utmost regard to the business in which he is representing at the time of the show I saw a few one star reviews here obviously somebody disgruntled because he didn't get to sing right away or Brad was just plain doing his job His music selection is beyond reproach once you get to know Brad you'll understand you ask him to get a song will do his best to find it in a reasonable time and  bend over backwards for people to enjoy his shows My Wife and I have been going to his shows for the better part of 5 years and there's not a karaoke host in the valley that has the sound system or the showmanship and professionalism Brad has

Went because of Karaoke which was awesome... What I didn't like was the fact that we had horrible service and was given an attitude by the bartender just because we weren't quote unquote regulars I could tell the distane and annoyance when we asked for more drinks because she was talking with some guys at the end of the bar..  No seevice to my wife and I count us out we won't be back again Food was mediocre at best and the terrible thing was it wasn't even that busy
