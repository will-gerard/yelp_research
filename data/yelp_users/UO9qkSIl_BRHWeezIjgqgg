I absolutely love Postino's - the atmosphere, the food, the wine. I give it 5 stars because the atmosphere and service is amazing - friendly, refreshing, fun. The bruschetta is awesome, of course!

Wowza. This is the best burger fast food place I've ever been to, honestly. The rating I've gave is based on the FRESHNESS of the burger (the veggies were amazing, and the bun was whole wheat! Yay!) and the FRIENDLINESS of the staff. I loved it all! My only complaint was that the burger was a bit too thin for my taste, but that's probably just me. Overall I was really surprised when I came here, and of course, it was my first time here, having grown up on the east coast. I'll be back here, yummm!

Now I've never been to Chicago and I've never had the deep dish, so I'm probably not the best person to be writing this review, but I'm still going to put in my thoughts! Not bad, but not good, either. What really ruined it for me was the cheese. It was just, rubbery. I don't think any kind of pizza should have rubbery cheese. That's a huge no-no for me. The crust was good, though. I liked the balance of softness and crispy.

Tasty!! I ordered the stuffed dates and the skirt steak. Both were pretty good. I'd definitely go back and try other things on the menu.  What I liked most about this place was definitely the atmosphere - cozy and friendly!

Yum yum. My ex and I came here to celebrate our first night of being in Phoenix as we just moved here. The atmosphere gave off a pleasant vibe, and it wasn't too dark or noisy. Mind you, the Tilted Kilt was right next to this place, so I thought it was going to be crazy loud, but I was wrong! Our waiter was really nice, talkative, never had an issue with him or the service. I had the jambalaya which was pretty awesome. My ex got the stuffed crab, which was good as well, though his was a pretty small portion. He shared the rest of my jambalaya, which was huge - I couldn't eat it all myself! The drinks were PERFECT. The beer on tap was awesome and I had 2 cocktails that blew me away. I liked this place a lot and I'll definitely be back.

I cannot rave enough about this place - the environment, the people, but specifically, those tsoynami's. As a dairy free lady living in this city, Nami is everything I could ask for when it comes to desserts! I'm a local at Nami, and you know it's bad when they know your name at the order stand. I cannot get enough of their cookie dough, also.
