Bad, bad, bad.  Moved to the Valley from Tucson and based on many yelper's comments decided to try Nando's to get our Mexican food fix.  There was a line out the door and the place was packed.  We had high hopes.  Guacamole tasted like something purchased in a refrigerated section of the grocery store.  Salsa tasted like tomato sauce.  Neither my husband nor I could finish the food.  Bland, not the least bit authentic and downright gross.  Took the leftovers home to my teenage kids (they usually eat everything).  They took one bite and discarded the rest...citing that Taco Bell was more authentic.  My only assumption can be that those that have yelped have never experienced authentic Mexican food.

Found this on Yelp and became an instant fan!  At the end of nowhere in the San Tan Valley area, you come across the big metal pig and know you're in the right place.  This tiny little shop was bursting with busy the entire time we were there.  On our first trip, we purchased the peppered bacon...among the best I've ever had, the jalapeño sausage...mmmm  mmmmm yummy, jalapeño brats and the pork sticks (snack sized smoked sausage in various flavors).  They were an instant hit and instant snack necessity.  The shop sells everything pork related... ribs, chops, hocks, steaks, roasts, sausages, bacon, ham, loins, sticks and lunch meat.  The quality and freshness of everything make it worth the drive and price.  Perfect for Bacon and Pork lovers!  On a side note, found out that The Deli (my favorite restaurant in the valley) purchases their pork here.  Its all coming together...

Who know you'd find this in the desert??  Pizza Heaven! Pie Paradise!  Bianco is blissful!  Was on my list for a while.  Finally stopped in for dinner before an event at a nearby arena.  Got there at around 6 to beat the crowd.  Charming old building with a hip fun atmosphere.  Service was timely and very personable.  Recommendations were thoughtful and relevant.  The food was AMAZING.  We split a salad and the sausage pizza.  I didn't want it to end.  I could have just eaten the sausage and been happy.  The crust and the smoky flavor from the pizza oven threw me over the edge.  Highly recommend just for the flavor.  Throw in great location and awesome service and you have the trifecta!  It is important to note that this is a very small place with just a few tables and a small bar.  Not ideal for big groups.

After reading the reviews, we were excited to experience sushi nirvana. Didn't quite get there.  We started with the Deluxe Sashimi Platter.  Around $125, the presentation was gorgeous.  Chef's choice sashimi, it does include some of the harder to find specialities.  We also had the Grilled Pork Belly which had great flavor, but the amount of fat was too much to handle.  The crispy fried squid with chili and lime was flavorful.  Overall the flavor, atmosphere and service was good.  But that's just it.  It was merely good.  I can't complain about the taste or quality of the food, but I can't write home about it either.  I've been known to pay a lot for a meal.  This one was not worth it.

Let me preface this by saying...I wasn't even that hungry! Discovered the most amazing restaurant today. Tucked away in a nondescript dusty corner of nowhere in Queen Creek, it is the best place I've eaten in the whole Phoenix Valley. If they had a central location, there'd be a 2 hour wait to get in. Prosciutto wrapped homemade warm mozzarella appetizer to die for. Cuban pork sandwich that makes you want to become cuban. Chicken sandwich that tasted so good, you don't want to swallow...just let the flavor mellow in your mouth. And to top it off, homemade ice cream for dessert...Honey Jack Daniels and Cinnamon Brown Sugar. If you live in Gilbert, Chandler, Queen Creek or even Tucson...GO EAT HERE!!! I want to go back when I'm really hungry with a large group of friends so we can try the whole menu. -- at The Deli Queen Creek.

Tony introduced himself right away and asked if it was our first time.  We were quickly ushered to a seat with some garlic knots on the house!  Tony then recommended that we do half white and half deluxe pizza!  They were both amazing!  Best NY style pizza I've had in AZ!  Fast, friendly service combined with amazing food!  Can't wait to go back and try some of the pasta and sandwiches.  Only thing missing was a beer, but I didn't miss it enough to rate lower than 5!

Fantastic service.  They take a team approach that leaves no one waiting too long.  The only wait is to get in.  The bruschetta is worth it.  Try one, try three, try them all.  They're all amazing!  If you are a wine lover, you can drink to content and have all the best snacks to go along with it...olives, cheese, bruschetta.
