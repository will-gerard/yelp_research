Ever since I started working downtown, I vowed to continue my personal tradition of rewarding myself with something yummy and sinful...kinda like a pat on the back for a job well done for the week. In my previous life as a PR bitch in the private sector, I rewarded myself with libations--vodka/tonics with two limes for extra Vitamin C; vodka Collins with three maraschino cherries instead of one; cranberry and vodka because I heard it cleanses out your urinary tract; a dirty martini for those super grueling weeks.  Alas, when I started to work in the public sector, still in PR, I knew I couldn't pull that shit anymore. I had to re-vamp my rewards structure and take out the "sinful" from "yummy and sinful." That's when I discovered fro-yo...that's frozen yogurt to you all.  My co-worker took me out for coffee one day and quickly mentioned that there is a locally owned frozen yogurt shop on Washington and First Streets. She said they give hefty portions, so I thought to myself that this might just be a good replacement for my vodka concoctions.  The place is called A Touch of Yogurt, and their fro-yo is yummy to the tummy. They are pretty generous with their servings, and the toppings you choose to include in your fro-yo. And then when I did some diggin' about fro-yos, I found out fro-yo can: 1. Help to overcome lactose intolerance; 2. aid digestion of milk protein: 3. help prevent and combat digestive tract infections. Okay...fro-yo had me at "overcome lactose intolerance..." that's all I'm going to say about that! They change their menu of flavors...you know, to mix it up a little...keeps you guessing. But no matter what flavors they have available, I am sure that you will find one so satisfying.   So Fridays, I've officially declared Yvette's Fro-Yo Fridays. I order my "small," sit on one of the outdoor tables, and stare at politicians, lawyers, bums, construction workers, delivery people, while enjoying a mouth-watering serving of fro-yo.   Hey feel free to join me every Friday for FRO-YO Fridays around 12:30-ish. Oh but not this Friday I'm in San Francisco. So just for this week...FRO-YO THURSDAY!  Anyway...I give it 4 stars...because, let's face it...it might be yummy, but it still ain't ice cream!

You gotta love Justina, the owner...I just don't know why she keeps chopping her hair off. But she is like a walking fashion show.   Anyway, we have been going to Cyclo since its early days. Coming from the Bay Area, we were a bit disappointed that there were no decent Asian restaurants in the area, until we stumbled upon this restaurant. The flavors of the foods are amazing, really rich and sometimes a bit complex. Try the Hanoi and the shrimp appetizer...yum! And I truly enjoy the refreshing lemonade...a bit on the sweet side, but strangely refreshing! You have to go! Oh, and you can bring your own wine...just make sure it's a good bottle. Justina's going to make a note of it if you bring a cheap one.

I have to give props to Chef Beau McMillan for doing "fusion"  right. "Fusion" is a dime a dozen nowadays, and only a few can do it well. For dinner, I highly suggest the salmon with the udon noodles, if it is available (menu changes depending on what's in season). And for dessert, please try the banana concoction. It is just divine! So, yes, I'm a big fan of Chef Beau (he is not pretentious and seems fun). Afterall, he did beat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef.

It's not bad Asian food. I'll tell you this...you'll probably enjoy your lunch more over here with your buddy than across the way at Pei-Wei. It's not as crowded, therefore the noise level is conducive to gossiping or business talks. The Bourbon chicken is pretty good, and I personally like the Malaysian chicken, made with a dry curry sauce...oh boy, was it spicy...but the good kind.   Yun (the manager or the owner? not sure) is just too friendly and funny. If you don't see something in the menu, or you want to combine a number of things from the menu...just ask Yun if he can accomodate. And he most likely can hook you up with what you are craving for.

I used to frequent AZ 88 when I used to live in the Scottsdale. I loved it for its setting--somewhat hidden, somewhat quiet, trendy enough but not too much that it suffocates. I enjoyed their food because of its simple decadence--sandwiches with no-frills sauces, grilled vegetables with a tangy sauce that doesn't over power, and their waffle fries that make you curse Atkins until his dead (oh, wait, he IS dead). Best of all, I enjoyed their drinks. Always refreshing, always exciting, and always seem to creep up to you when least expected giving you a pleasant buzz that makes  everyone around you appear like they're on high definition.  So, really the 2 measly stars are not for the food, ambiance, or drinks. They're for SLADE.  It's been a couple of years (or more) since we visited AZ 88. I thought of going there for dinner last weekend to celebrate Fathers Day. Afterall, it used to be one of my husband's favorite eating joints. So  I invited my parents, my kids and of course my husband, to have a quiet enjoyable dinner over there.  We immediately found a table for 6--a good sign. Everything was going great until SLADE came along. Slade was our slick, "I-really-ought-to-be-in-LA-acting" waiter. The minute he saw our group, he immediately put on his scowl face and his "why-do-I-end-up-with-these-people" attitude. Was it the kids? Or was it the rare Asian people who made up our group?  (And just a note: my kids grew up eating in restaurants--from SeaSaw to In and Out, and yes they've eaten at AZ 88 before. They've done it all because I don't cook. They even order mom's drinks...for her, of course. And yes, my parents speak English...like the kind you can understand!)  Two seconds after settling to our table, he asks what we would like to drink. I have never felt pressured in my life to think of an alcoholic concoction. Five seconds had passed, and Slade was already sending off telepathic messages to me, saying "hurry up, bitch, you're wasting my time." So I finally blurted out, "Could you please give us a couple of minutes to think. We'd like to see a drink menu, if we could." He grabbed a drink menu, plopped it on the table, and quickly pivoted and sashayed away from our table without saying a word.  I don't know about you, but I thought that was rude.   When we finally decided on our drink orders, Slade's OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder) became apparent. He couldn't care less if we had enough ketchup, or if we needed more tangy sauce for the vegetables, or if we needed any kind of condiment to compliment our respective meals.  All he cared about was making sure that each of our drinks was set on a napkin.   He watched each of us like a hawk, making sure that, as we set our glass down, it was placed on a napkin! One time, my son unknowingly set his water glass on HALF the napkin, and Slade was right there to set things right for him, accompanied with an annoyed sigh, of course. Never once did he ask if we needed anything else...he just wanted to make sure that our glasses were on napkins!  Thank god for the food, and the drinks. Those did not fail us. My husband enjoyed that part. But SLADE, and his OCD, oh and his over-gelled hair...that's gotta go!   Thus 2 stars.

Love , love this place!   The oldest  and largest independent bookstore in the state!   The staffers are dedicated to making reading cool again. They are knowledgeable and can help you find the book you are looking for even if you give them measly clues, like: "...ummm...the cover is blue, and I think the author's last name starts with a P...sounds Indian."   How? Well, it's obvious that they are a well-read group whose literary tastes range from,chick-lit to teen fantasy, from bestselling novels to graphic novels, from self-help to erotica, from political to the new classic children's picture books.  The store also hosts amazing authors who probably didn't  even consider including Phoenix in their book tour 7 years ago. They've had authors like Michael Moore, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Diana Gabaldon, Christopher Moore (who's coming back, BTW), Malcolm Gladwell, Tony Bourdain, Byron Katie, Madeliene Albright, Sen. John McCain to name a few. And most recently, they've hosted Sen. Barack Obama and Pres. Carter (boy , that was a wild one!). Getting those authors into the Valley is Changing Hands' way of promoting  reading, especially to the younger set.   Even more, CHB is a founding member of Arizona Chain Reaction, a coalition that supports independently-owned businesses who try to educate the community about how buying locally can benefit the community. They don't condemn big businesses at all. They simply encourage consumers to support small, independent businesses equally. I hear that their PR person gives free lectures to owners of small businesses on how to market and publicize their businesses.  I love it because I get to meet a very diverse group of people. It's fun chatting with an ASU archeology professor about which picture books kids are going for; or explaining to a North Scottsdale woman what Tibetan singing bowls are; or describing how the chocolate rods (from Granny's Chocolates, of course) taste like to a professional ballet dancer; or sharing the embarassment of appearing "big" on TV to a homeless person; or reminiscing about the music you grew up listening to with aging hippies...and yes, the pseudo-hippies as well.   Now located in suburban Tempe (driven away by high costs, etc. from the downtown area), the store seems to have kept their customer base through the years and changes. What's even more wonderul is that, now, they have managed to cater to the younger crowd, the hipsters, and even to the 30-something suburban women who might be afraid to encounter (gasp!) dread-locked, patchouli-scented boys and girls.  And although CHB staffers are the most educated group of people I know (I would say: 70% have one or more Bachelor's degrees, maybe 10% have their Master's degrees, and the remaining 20% are still working on it), they are not perfect. But they are hardworking, funny, creative, and know how to party well.  I know all this because I practically live there and I truly dig the place! Just have them page me.

The rich wood decor gives you the feeling that 20- and 30-somethings don't belong here...but stay a little while and you'll soon learn that the menu is very modern (Asian-Pacific fusion) and their happy hour specials at the Fusion Bar can make you really happy!   We definitley go for happy hour! The appetizers during happy hour are half-priced (and we're not talking fries and peanuts here!). The menu includes a whopping kobe burger and crab cakes and kabobs that are drizzled with mouth-watering sauces that I can't even pronounce. Well drinks and house wines are 3.5 and draft beers are 2.25. Plus, there's this musician named Ivan who does a mean Lyle Lovett, Counting Crows and even the Beatles (acoustically!).   I consider this place a hidden gem!

This is NOT your neighborhood Olive Garden in the heart of the Ahwatukee Foothills...this is Italian cooking at its best. The ambiance is fit for that "I-must-impress-her" first date or that "darn-I-forgot-our anniversary-again" make-up and make-out dinner.   The ambiance is cozy and classy (white linens, and no red check table cloths) the staff are attentive and knowledgeable about the food...now that's important, especially if you don't understand Italian.  They serve lunch, and I've had their smoked chicken fettucine pasta, which is one of their lunch specials ($9-10?). The sauce was excellent--creamy, but not heavy, and punctuated with the saltiness of pancetta, if I'm not mistaken. The chicken was cooked (maybe grilled) just right, a bit on the smoky side to add another texture to the overall flavor.   Now if you are on that date--whether it be with your spouse, significant other, or whomever--you HAVE to start your dinner with some cocktails and appetizers at the bar, where they have Happy Hour from 4-7 p.m. Tues-Saturdays. The appetizers (calamari, baby!) are half-off, plus drink specials.   Bellissimo! I'm telling you...

I may be lactose intolerant but that has not stopped me from binging on gelato.  Gelato 64 is located in the Lee Lee's Plaza on the NE corner of Dobson and Warner. I'll tell you now...it's no Arlecchino, but the quality of the gelato is better than the one just down the road from this place.   The shop is brand-spanking new, almost clinical-looking, with it's white walls, streamlined lighting, and minimal furnishings (mostly Ikea-looking).The interior is simply non-descript, almost too bland and boring-looking. But perhaps there was a reasoning behind the seemingly sterilized, minimalist environment...ah, yes, of course. The element that seems to give the room character and subtle vibrancy is the gelato.  The flavor selection is pretty impressive...almost Baskin Robbins-esque, with its 31 flavors (or maybe more!). The consistency of the gelato is excellent, very creamy and it doesn't leave you with a gritty feeling in your mouth. As far as flavors go, I think the fruitier ones win over the chocolate, or cream-based flavors. For example, their rum raisin just lacked the "punch" of rum, and their cherry vanilla really was just vanilla with chunks of frozen cherry. If you were only served one chunk of cherry, then expect to be eating vanilla gelato the rest of the time.  In contrast, their mango and raspberry, for example, had just the right tartness that made you pucker with delight. The fruity flavors were true to taste and were magnificent when combined.   I say, go for the fruit flavors!  The staff members were very friendly and courteous, and were very generous in giving you sample tastings. You gotta appreciate that!

So you waited until the last minute to get your college best friend a present for her birthday. Problem is: you don't see her very often, thus, you don't really know what she's into nowadays. You want to give her something that's unique and stylish and unusual, something that exudes "Phoenix-chic," something that you know she'll love because it's artsy. What do you do...what do you do?  Well, you really ought to go to MADE art boutique on Roosevelt Row. The boutique houses artist-made gift items, like pottery, clothing, jewelry, bags, cards for all occasions, sculptures, books, and even chocolates!   I received this really cool-looking necklace that has an antique poker chip that says "bulldog" embellished with tiny crystals for a pendant.  It's such a conversation piece every time I wear it. I also purchased a very colorful purse made of gum wrappers that is just so perfect for spring!  What makes this place even more special is that it hosts workshops in creative writing and in various forms of art. Very cool!  Right next to eyelounge...check it out (especially that book "Toilets of the World)!

My son has a cowlick that can stop any decent hairstylist on his/her tracks. Throughout his young 8 years, he has visited almost every hair stylist in every hair salon chain in the southeast Valley, with and without the video game equipment. While these gifted hair gurus can find a solution to keep his crazy cowlick at bay, the solution is often short-lived. A week after any haircut, the cowlick is at it again, growing unusually faster than the rest, creating the look of a rooster's comb at the very top of my poor son's head.  That was until he met face-to-face with the cowlick doctor, Ralph of AA Barber Shop.  AA Barber Shop--a non-pretentious joint where young boys become dedicated to the one barber of their choice, who will groom them the same way each month until they become men. It's a place where men, who are long-time customers, bring their sons as part of a tradition. It is a place where moms sit quietly, patiently wait for their sons to get their haircuts without a single peep simply because there's too much testostorone going around. It is a place where cowlicks don't stand a chance!  I am grateful for this place, grateful for Ralph for taming the wild cowlick, and grateful that a $2-tip is still happily accepted.  Boys, you ought to check it out!

So, it's a Saturday night and you are really aching for some Vietnamese food. You head on over to the tried-and-tested, everyone's favorite--Cyclo. But alas, there is a line, a LONG line. And no matter how much you beg and plead with owner in stilettos, Justina, she ain't budging. She sticks one finger at you and says, "You just have to wait."  Your stomach growls. What do you do?  Well you just drive a little to the north and try Anise Restaurant.   Located across from Lee Lee's, this little-known Vietnamese place serves pretty good Vietnamese pho (the chicken kind), which my dining partner ordered. The flavors were simple, almost true to what pho should really taste like (some I've tasted try too hard by overdoing spices and seasonings, and some also have this unexplainable greasy taste). I tried the Anise noodles as recommended by our waitress and it was pretty darn yummy! I had that with the summer rolls with peanut sauce on the side, and it was addicting. I was a pig, even for just an hour...I was a pig! And I loved every minute of it.   Oh, and just for kicks, my dining partner ordered the shrimp burschetta simply because that's his favorite item to order at Cyclo. And, the decision is: he still loves Cyclo's shrimp bruschetta. But this comes as a close second.   The service was excellent, the place...neat and tidy, which is great and pleasant. However, I must say that here is something about a small restaurant in frenzy, like what happens to Cyclo on a weekend. I think the bustle and demand for tables at Cyclo makes me appreciate the food over there more. It's like like acquiring a hot commodity and you kinda wanna go "neener-neener" to those who stand by  the door and wait their turn while they salivate.  At any rate, Anise is a good alternative. Definitely something that should always be considered when craving for Vietnamese food. The price is very reasonable, and it's an inviting place to take everyone on the family.

Every third Thursday of the month (or so), this fabulous group meets and drinks and vents about their work load and the many ignoramuses (or is it ignoramii) they work with, while handing you their business card with a "call me." No it's not a dating service, it's Az Media Buzz, spearheaded by none other than network spearheading extraordinaire, Joel.  Anyway, the last time Az Media Buzz had a get-together, it was held at Bar Smith, tucked away in the middle of downtown, somewhere on Washington. The management extended their happy hour prices to the Az Media Buzz folks up to 8 p.m. (instead of the usual 7 p.m.) AND (the important part), they provided free appetizers, three chafing dishes full...and the group didn;t even ask for it! Now that was extra-special.  I personally didn't order any food because...well, I wasn't hungry. I was more "thirsty" if you get my drift. So for me to review them for their food would not be appropriate.  Instead, please allow me to review their service. I was lucky enough to meet the manager, this cute and compact Latino man wearing what looked to be a fauxhawk. I approached him,held out my hand, and gave him my sincerest thanks for hosting the group and providing free appetizers (what media person doesn't appreciate that?) to the group. His response to me was: "O my goodness, I've been meaning to go over to your table and say HI but you were kinda intimidating."  Bwahahaha! To that I say: "Honey, I ain't intimidating...I'm only 5 feet tall! I don't bite. I may be loud as heck, but I am as friendly as any politician running for president right now!"  How sweet of him to even confess that? He gave me his card and gave me a quick tour of the place, and explained where the artwork on the walls are from. He informed me that they serve lunch and that I should give it a try, and for his friendliness, I will!   Kudos to that lovely manager for his one-on-one with customers.  Now, about my waiter/bartender--DALE. Red-head, already a plus in my book. The guy conversed with me a little bit (in-between serving the Buzz people) about Sol y Sombra chef's new restaurant OverEasy (which apparently was visited by some Yelpers and I wasn't invited...whatever!!!). He was definitely a friendly guy who mixed up some refreshing vodka collins for little ol' me the right way. He encouraged me to visit the rooftop bar, and I did. (That spot is perfect for a small to medium sized party on a balmy spring evening, I must say.) Dale was an absolute doll!  I see a lot of potential for this place...the employees are good people it seems. I have to stop by for lunch, though, so I can review them for their food. Bur for now, I am reviewing their service and the people and for that I give them 5 stars!  And I feel awful for Abbey having a bad experience, but I think that they just switched management, and things seem to be for the better. Ask for Mr. Madrigal next time...he's super-duper nice.

Welcome to the Happiest Place on Earth...at least on the east side of the Valley! Welcome to BevMo, where everyone shopping has a strange, contented look in their faces as they stroll down aisle after aisle of beers, wines, and any other liquor you can think of.  Short for Beverages and More,  this wonderland offers a wide variety of anything alcoholic at very, very reasonable prices. Aside from the liquors, the super store also offers a variety of liquor accoutrements (i.e. corkscrews, wine glasses, decanters, designer bottle openers, wine bags...you name it, they have it) that can help enhance your beverage experience. Their wine selections are categorized by color and regions, and you will definitely be impressed. Of course, the champagnes are in a different league, and yes, they do have a section of their own.   But  what about the non-alcoholics, you may ask... Why, yes, they do have those! They have the standards--Coke, Pepsi, Pepper, etc.--and they also have the kinds that come from smaller soda factories.  Now what about the price, you ask... Let's just say, I've bought a gorgeous bottle of Belvedere Vodka (citrus flavor) for $18 (!!!). Unheard of, as far as I'm concerend. Grey Goose? I've seen it as low as $20 a bottle (!!!). And here's one that blew me away...  Last holiday season, I stumbled upon an impressive Belvedere gift pack that included a 750 ml. size bottle plus two exquisite-looking martini glasses for...drumroll, please....$30!!! Needless to say, that gift pack sold out fairly quickly.  Here are two more features that will add more fun to your trip: there is a wine tasting bar that stays open for customers to give their featured wines a try. AND...they do sell cigars...COHIBA!   Forget discount party center...this is where you should go for your party needs!  BevMo has that frequent shopper card that all major grocery stores have. If you have accumulated $200 in purchases, they give you a discount coupon towards your next purchase. Also, according to the friendly check out person I encountered the other day, you can shop online and just pick it up at your nearest BevMo. Sadly, I think this is the only BevMo in the state...and thank god, I live near it!  Salud!

First of all, please forgive. I have been AWOL for the past...months!!! So many changes in my life have happened--mainly the "career" aspect of it--that I haven't had the chance to catch up with the "social" aspect.   Okay, I jest...I've been going to happy hours left and right that I haven't had time to even write a single review for the past few months. Hey, at least I know that the first step is acknowledgement that I have a slight problem.  Anyway, I work in downtown Phoenix now...and let me start off my new batch of reviews with the NASTY.  Here it is in a nutshell...101 Bistro is a waste of precious, precious real estate! From what I've heard, this restaurant has re-incarnated itself a few times, and each time, the owners can't seem to get it right.   It was lunch time and this sheltered suburbanite decided to step into what seemed like a very cool place from the outside. 101 Bistro has a corner, sidewalk patio where you know want to be seen with your patent leather high-heeled shoes, your Chloe Paddington bag (the fake one, of course), and maybe your pouffy, yappy dog, while sipping tea and munching on the most decadent chocolatey cheesecake. Well, I didn't possess any of those that day, so I opted for a table inside where the lunch atmosphere was the typical "blue-tied gentlemen and women in ubiquitous polyester suits (not that there's anything wrong with polyester)" all intently examining the mysterious brown leather-bound portfolio, acting as if they have some top secret shit in their hands. You know the kinds.  Anyway, my lonely self found a corner table and began looking at their lunch menu that is supposed to be served fast enough to get you back in the office on time. I decided on the gyro--with slices of meat, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, onion and then drizzled with a Mediterranean yogurt sauce wrapped in a fresh, warm pita bread (is that what you call the bread?). Oh it was served super fast alright, too fast that the warm pita bread was not at all warm and the thin slices of meat could use a little more nuking (oh please don't tell me that they only grill their meats...if you have to serve it quick, I'm sure you nuke it). The meat also needed more seasonings (Mediterranean seasonings preferably). Ooooh, and that yogurt sauce drizzled over it? Water-y and bland.  So, my lonely self was forced to never let go of the pepper shaker throughout my dining experience and peppered that crap out of that gyro just to give my taste buds some kind of sensation and pleasure. Then I had a thought! Maybe...just maybe...I should order some kind of dessert to make my lonely self feel all better deep inside. But alas, I looked at their refrigerated display case where their desserts are housed, and sad to report, I couldn't really see inside because of the major condensation on the glass! Their frickin refrigerated display case was not working up to par; there was a pool of water on the floor (meaning: the ice is melting); and there are rounds and rounds of cheesecake and other dairy-filled goodies in there waiting to be saved!!! IN THE SUMMER HEAT!!! Uhhh...I don't know about you but, improperly refrigerated dairy desserts in the Arizona heat is a no-no to me. Sadness filled my heart for 101 Bistro. It has the potential to become the hip happening lunch place to be seen, especially when the light rail is up and running.   But hey, the service was fast...so fast that they forgot to give me my iced tea (until I realized that I was choking on the bland gyro) and my eating utensils (until I realized that I needed a fork and a napkin to wipe off the watery yogurt sauce dribbling down my chin).   Sad!

Here's why I love thee:  1. Minimal decor...so hip, so modern, so easy to clean.  2. The bartenders are cute. They possess an inner suave without even trying. They're shy but in that "you know Ideserve an extra tip from you" way.  3. The custard dessert was an unusual blend of Japanese and Western flavors that you're not even sure what hit you because it's so complex.  4. The butterfish was just like butta...  5.  And the waitresses...they wore 4-inch heels without hesitation. They were fierce...the shoes, too.  Will definitely go back, and I will highly recommend to many of my friends.

Okay, this is to prove that I am a big dork!  I went to Putsy's Chicken and Steak for the first time to get me some dinner. I can't cook to save my life, I wanted me some chicken, and I didn't want to go far to get this chicken. Putsy's is very near my house (I could walk to it, but of course, I looove wasting gas) and I heard that their chicken fingers are pretty scrumptious with different sauces.  I ordered the Caddyshack Basket with three honkin', pieces of fowl and some fries. The chicken was pretty good...very flaky, seasoned well, has enough crunch to keep me tuning in, and had enough juices to keep me biting. The fries...well, it was on the soggy side, but nothing to fret about. I tried the chicken fingers (and btw, they were huge...like McNuggets but on steroids) with two kinds of sauces--I opted for the honey mustard and went with Rebecca T's recommendation of creamy avocado. I must say, Rebecca was so right on with the creamy avocado dip. So unexpected, in my opinion. It's kinda like eating fresh-out-of-the-oven tortilla chips and dipping it in guacamole without the chunks.   My dining partner had the steak sandwich with the tobacco onions, which he claimed was good, but the horseradish sauce was too overpowering. He did have allergies that time and the horseradish might've helped with the clearing up the sinuses.  So overall, not a bad dinner.   But here's why I am liking Putsy's: 1. Sixteen Candles was playing. 2. They seem to like Ferris Bueller.  And finally... 3. (...this is why I'm a dork) I left my big-ass purse  it's so in this season) in the restaurant without even noticing that I did until lunch time the following morning. The nice guys at Putsy's searched my purse for a name and contact info of the owner all night long (there wasn't much since I had my wallet with me the whole time). What's really valiant about these guys is: they had to go through...girly stuff...  Hooray for Putsy's!!! (but just don't say that name too fast...you could be calling it something else without realizing it...you know what I mean? ; )

The Hero Factory     Big-ass (can I use "big-ass' as an adjective?) hoagies the way it's done in New York.  This place packs the meat in their hoagies, and I mean pack. In my book, they don't gyp you. They use Boar's Head meats, which is prime in the deli world, and they pack the other good stuff into their sandwiches, too, like tomatoes, peppers, whatever! Of course, it is a little pricier than your typical Subway, but c'mon...the meats, the bread, the accoutrements are waaay better. This new place, located smack downtown, is a hit among the big names in the Phoenix scene (politicians and high-powered City and State officials). You never know who you're going to run into.     Owners Nicole and Jay (who moved to Phoenix from, yes, New York), run the counter themselves, and let me tell you, they are characters. They will throw the f-bomb once in a while, but not in an offensive way. They do it in the most endearing New Yorker way.      I highly recommend this new deli joint. Buy one of their hoagies and you get two lunches out of it. And BTW, they do a "Hungryman Breakfast sandwich" and it is a cardiologist's nightmare, but a meat and breakfast lover's dream come true. This breakfast hoagie has breakfast potatoes, bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, and topped with American cheese for good measure. If you get one of these breakfast beauties, you might want to share with a friend...preferably a carnivore friend.      So check it out, will ya?

Went to Indulge Burgers for the first time after Ignite Phoenix After Hours. Wanted to stay there forever.  Here's the thing: If you're craving a burger, we all have several options. There's a fast food burger joint practically in every corner, and almost any "American Fare" restaurant and bar has their signature burger on their menu. Btu what sets Indulge Burgers apart is the opportunity to build your own--that's right BYOB (burger, that is). Now, all of a sudden, that burger you're wanting becomes a burger you'd kill for (maybe not to that extreme, but you get what I mean), because it will have everything you are looking for in a burger.  Their burgers are all about juiciness, and partnered with their brioche bread, become divine.   Ordered sweet potato fries with my lovely burger creation because, well, I heard it's better for you...whatever. It came with a dipping sauce on the side, which, at first glance, looked like some Italian dressing. But I was so wrong! This was the ish! The sauce is actually the liquefied, melted version of marshmallow cream/fluff with a dash of cinnamon. Some of you might think that the sauce might be too sweet and would ruin the meal and you all are so wrong! The sweetness of the fries and dipping sauce actually enhances the savoriness of my burger! That sauce was like crack and I wish they bottled it. I could not get enough of the fries and dipping sauce combo. I wanted to lick it clean but, I was all dressed nicely, you know.  Service was very good, and the staff was great and friendly. I love the place, I want to live there. Or at least live near them. But alas, I live all the way in Tukee. Boo-hiss.  So now I have two wishes: Please bottle your sweet (crack-like) sauce and open an Indulge Burgers in PHOENIX!

Well, well...I'm the 100th review for SideBar. Appropriate, I say.  What can I say...love this bar!   It's got this "neighborhood bar" vibe without the look of being tired, old, boringly familiar...get me?  The drink concoctions are deliciously dangerous (meaning: the good kind). Owner and uber-hip Josh Parry knows how to blend natural fruit juices, herbs and spices, and even horchata to come up with a drink that is can be so addicting...in a good way of course.   The ambiance is urban lounge-y, dark and private enough that you can have an intimate date here or show up with not a lot of make-up on and still look good. The crowd varies from young professionals, to hipsters, to government notables, to quirky artists...a good mix. Josh invites DJ on weekends and always holds fun events every now and then.  Personally, I am a fan of SideBar and Josh because they know their downtown PHX community. They are always ready to support a good cause and realize the importance of keeping the downtown scene alive. I have hosted two social events at SideBar and both were well attended (100+ guests) simply because they know that SideBar will graciously accommodate

Red Velvet Bread Pudding! GO!  Divine! It even has a dark chocolate surprise somewhere deep in the bread pudding that i didn't expect, but totally went ape-shit when I found it.  The food was good and filling, and lots of variety. I'm a breakfast girl myself and their selection was a-ok, and their portions more than enough.  Here's my reason for not giving the place the fifth star: I normally go on a Sunday brunch, the only time I have to enjoy a brunch. Now, I've got nothing against church-going people, but at that time, that's the crowd you get -- grandparents dressed to the nines, their hair perfectly did, smelling like a rose garden on steroids; the kids are wearing one of their best outfits and are itching to take them off; the hungry babies are in full force...and then there's me and my posse, walking in the restaurant with dark glasses and ratty jeans, unshowered, with a hint of morning breath. A little out of place right?  I'm going to go ahead and call us a little "edgier" than the Sunday crowd.  But...the Red Velvet bread pudding...GO!

First of all, I'm glad that Lola moved in to this space. I miss Calabria, but I'm glad something worthy has taken over this spot that serves delectable things.  Thanks to Chef Danielle (formerly of Sweet Pea Bakery), Lola's baked goods are worth dreaming about. If you ever find macarons (perhaps this is the French spelling?), then you have to purchase one or two because those things are to die for.  I like the ambiance, I like the staff and people who frequent it. It's a good crowd, mostly on their laptops or busy reading their books or newspapers.  Here's my one and only complaint: They don't make their drip coffee hot enough.  I'm a simple gal. I don't ask for those mocha, macchiato, extra foam, skinny-skinny, with drizzle and powder on top kinda drinks. I just want simple brewed coffee with some room for my cream.  The first time I purchased coffee at Lola's, it was served in a cup because I chose to drink it there. And it was already lukewarm, therefore, it was "iced" coffee by the time I had my second sip. The next time, I asked for it in a to-go cup, thinking that the lid might keep the coffee warmer longer. Alas, the drip coffee was lukewarm after my third sip. The last time I was there (3 days ago), I asked for them to put in a to-go cup again and to make it a little hotter than usual. Oh, it was hot alright, but maybe just 2 notches above their usual "warm."  I'm not looking for scalding coffee but just hot enough for me to enjoy hot coffee a little longer while reading the Arts section of the Arizona Republic (and there's really not much content in that section).  Can't a girl ever get hot coffee from there? That's all she asks.

Reasons why I love this place: 1. Horchata with all kinds of goodies inside, like pecans and cantaloups and strawberries, I mean these are "real" and not those freeze-dried stuff. My poblem with it is it only comes in one size--32 ounces, which is like two meals for me.  2. The salsa bar...never knew there could be so many kinds of salsa! That alone is an adventure in taste-testing. My personal fave is the jicama one, which really is more of a relish but who's checking.   3. Chicken mole and pibil...they do it right. Their mole could be a bit spicier for my taste but that's what the salsas are there for. I had the chicken mole as a taco and the pibil as a burro (separate occasion, alright, don't think I'm a pig now).  It's a great date place, I think. It's small, it's quaint, in a good neighborhood, and the satffers are very friendy.   I love this place so much that I didn't even care about the tiny creature scurrying across the floor near the front door. That's  not their fault though. That was just an unfortunate situation. Not a reflection of them.  So try it.

If you know me, you know that I'm an advocate of almost anything Phoenix.  That's why when Lucky Strike was set to move into Cityscape, I was thrilled. I've been to the Lucky Strike in LA, and have always had a great time.  I've been to Lucky Strike PHX about 4 times since it opened and for the most part, the wait and bar staff have been above par in their customer service. I am particularly appreciative of waitress Nicole, who has an uncanny ability to almost anticipate what the customer needs before they even ask. She has an overall pleasant personality without being too saccharin-sweet, know what I mean?  For employees like Nicole, I commend Lucky Strike.   Now, here's why Lucky Strike irritates me: it's their "we're hot shit" mentality.   1. I tried to reserve one lane for a Wednesday night, and they respond with a "we only take reservations 7 days prior." IT'S A WEDNESDAY NIGHT, FOR CRISSAKES! And this is Phoenix--not Hollywood, not DC, not Miami. People are not going to be lining up for lanes on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday night. At least NOT YET.  2. Do you validate parking? No, you don't. Not even an hour validation. Hell, CVS does even if we just buy a package of band-aids, but you don't. So we have to pay the $12 parking fee.  Throw us a bone here! We are Phoenicians who try to minimize walking in the heat. We like convenience but not at a steep price. Phoenician women also like to wear heels so why make them walk just to go to your establishment and spend AT LEAST $14 for the first game, $10 any additional games, and some change for libations and grub. You want us to patronize you, work with us. CVS did.  3. I know you're new but you gotta train your receptionists or the people who are tasked to answer the phones first. They are not rude, but they do sound clueless machines who will spew out the corporate answers to your questions. Just saying. A few almost sound as if they're "hot shit."  4. On your website, the dress code states: Head gear is not permitted. But it seems to me, fedoras are okay. Last I checked, a fedora is head gear. C'mon, don't be a hatist (as in HAT not HATE). Stick your policy and be fair. If you think a baseball cap might be gang-related...just remember the Mafias of yesteryears wore fedoras. If you're going to say "head gear," mean it and don't let your hosts make a subjective decision whether a hat is offensive or not. You're not god of head gears. (But do me a favor and kick out anyone wearing Ed Hardy caps.)  Lucky Strike, please understand that Phoenix is still learning that there is life after 5:30p.m. in the downtown area. We're not a tough crowd. I mean we're fascinated by flashing lights and air-conditioning. But we do need some coddling, some TLC. And when you "win us over," believe you me, we will be fierce followers. But the: 7-day advance reservation, no validated parking, the "we're hot shit" attitude might.and inconsistent dress code policy will not win us over. And I personally, would like for you to succeed here.  We Phoenicians are quite different form the LA, Miami, Denver, etc. people, so don't categorize us the way you would categorize them. We are fascinated with your right now--your concept is so hip and cool, we like it! But if you don't treat us right, it won't take us long to realize that at the heart of it all, you are just a bowling alley with soft-dim lights and air-conditioning.

UPDATE:  I'll tell you this much: Lucky Strike does listen to customers and take customer service seriously.  Shortly after this review, I got a nice note from their corporate headquarters apologizing for a not-so-good experience, and that's all I needed. I dig a company who acknowledges that there is always room to better serve their customers. I've been back to Lucky Strike many times (for lunch, for dinner, for a lazy Sunday) since then and there is definite improvement in phone manners and in handling customers' questions.  More importantly, Phoenix management went above and beyond for me on  a busy Friday night. I didn't expect an agreeable response, I simply thought there was no harm in asking, and management surprised me with an excellent solution.  And that excellent solution made a new mom/birthday girl very happy.  Fist bump to PHX management and staff.  Now if they can only do something about my game, I'd be set.

On January 4, twenty of my friends and I had a dinner at Humble Pie on 7th Street.  Two days before the date, I spoke to someone who took my original reservation for 15 w/o any problems. I also informed her that we will want separate checksI'm sure, to which she said that it wouldn't be a problem. On 1/4 around 2 p.m.., I called again to confirm the reservation at 5 p.m. and also informed the guy on the other line that the reservation will now be for 20 not 15. He said it wouldn't be a problem, but noticed that the note on the reservation said "separate checks." He then said that Humble Pie CANNOT do separate checks for groups of 8+ because that's their policy. I wish that I was given the correct information when I first called because that would've changed my decision to have the dinner there. Some of my guests were just going to stop by and not stay long for dinner. At that point, it was too late to find a place and inform all 20 guests of the change, so I stuck with it. But for the record, I was already annoyed that a staff member did not know an important restaurant policy that should've been ingrained from the firstday of training. The reasoning I was given for the "one check policy" was: "You only have one server for the evening...". That sounded like a recipe for poor customer service.  Well, that's pretty much what we got that evening.  1. As a guest was finishing up his Kiltlifter, he noticed that there was a piece of "ice" at the bottom of the glass, which he thought was odd for beer. As he got the piece of "ice" in his mouth, he realized it was a piece of broken glass. Luckily, my guest is so even-keeled that when he informed our waitress that evening of the broken glass, he didn't make a big fuss and just told the waitress to inform the bartender in case there are other shards lying around. She said that earlier in the day, a glass or two did break/shatter and the piece was probably one of the remnants. My other friend then got worried and checked her Kiltlifter from the bottom and noticed that the bottom of her pint glass was cracked.   The incident was clearly NOT the waitresses' fault and she quickly told us that both beers will not be charged. My guests were grateful and they each received another pint of Kiltlifter. Luckily, my guest didn't order a diet Coke first, which is his usual, because if he had, he wouldn't have even seen that piece of glass coming, and probably sucked on it like ice. But he didn't make a fuss because well, sh*t happens.  2. Then the SAME guest ordered his burger with no cheese because of dairy allergies. Everyone ordered pizza or wings. People got their food served, but an HOUR AND A HALF after he placed his order, he still hadn't gotten his burger. Again, the waitress was apologetic but at that point he didn't want the burger. You would think that they'd give him extra attention after the glass incident, but no. He didn't say anything because that isn't his personality and he knew that I would be upset. And since it was my birthday dinner he didn't make a fuss to ruin the evening. Some of my guests asked for water and that was a little difficult to get, too.   3. After all this inconvenience, we were hoping that they could honor our request for separate checks. But there were inconsistencies--some were granted that request and then some were not. Frustrating! To be honest, she was good for the most part doing her job solo. She probably would've gotten a 20+% gratuity anyway from each of the guest  Now imagine this concept, if there were maybe  2 servers or maybe 1 1/2 servers for our party, the poor service wouldn't have happened. One of them would've noticed that while everyone else was eating, one guest wasn't. Our waitress was not only waiting on our tables but other tables as well.  Humble Pie, look at it from our perspective: my guest, who sucked on a piece of broken glass and was not served his burger (but instead a consolation pepperoni pizza, which, according to the waitress, was ordered but she can't figure out who ordered it, but it didn't matter anyway because my guest is allergic to dairy) was forced to pay part of the gratuity that was included in the bill. For bad service.  And we're not faulting the waitress, who was working her a** off that evening, we fault poor management. I think you've done her a disservice because she seems awesome, but physically, you can only do so much.   I've supported this establishment when it was The Living Room and I wanted to support  Humble Pie because I support local. Sometimes good food is not enough.  Anyone can get "good food" anywhere and they are plentiful out there, but selling an experience is an art. I'm not complaining because I'm asking for compensation or a freebie. But I am asking you to consider how you manage the restaurant.

I've been MIA on YELP, sadly, but I've decided to come back because I think this business deserves some kind of a fist-bump-explode action...all I'm saying.  Here's the deal: Everytime I go to some networking, social shindig, I make it a point to give my personal biz card (Yes, I said "personal," not to be confused with my professional one). And every single time, the recipient will say, "Oh my, these cards are great...it's so YOU!"  Thaaat's right...and that's exactly what I expected from graphic artist extraordinaire, Jenny Domingo, when I asked her to create a business card for me that is quirky, bold, unexpected, and ME.  Working with Jenny is a breeze. She listens to what you envision, she gets it, she executes, and she executes it flawlessly. She has an amazing eye for design and color combo, which in my opinion, is ultra important when trying to capture attention.  More importantly, you'll get along with her...seamlessly. She is that cool and friendly--so much so, that you wished you knew her in high school. She's unpretentious but remains professional, not in the stuffy sense. Believe me when I say, "You'll like her."  Finally, her designs are effective.What do you mean, you ask?  Let's put it this way:  I was so overjoyed by the final design of my biz card that I posted it on my FB page, and a freelance client hired me on the spot---without even touching the actual business card.  I'm telling you...well worth it.  Oh, and P.S. Her biz partner Odeen rocks, too.

Started with a white wine recommendation from the server, which didn't disappoint. Custard Chardonnay complimented the rest of our happy hour meal.   I ordered my usual green bean tempura, a healthier alternative to fries. Always perfectly cooked. Spicy salmon and shrimp tempura rolls are great choices for happy hour.   FYI all appetizers are half off for happy hour and Tuesdays are half off wine bottles from 7 pm to close. It's a great place to take your friends. And it's in the heart of downtown. The patio is a great place for people watching...  I gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of opprtunistic flies hovering which was annoying. But they were gone after a few minutes. No big.
