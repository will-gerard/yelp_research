Nick's is a great little neighborhood spot! I do take out probably about 3-4 times a month from here! When I feel like dining in I usually go to the Pinnacle Peak location as I like to sit at the high-tops in the bar (I love sports and they usually always have a game playing on the tv).  ** Pinnacle Peak location

I lived in Italy for awhile a few years back and have been searching for great gelato here! Thank god I finally found it! Not only is the gelato amazing but the owners are all so sweet and you can tell they put a lot of love into their work! Thankfully I don't live to far but too those who do... it's definitely worth the drive!! Nocciola was always my fav in Italy and still is here :)

I really enjoyed my experience at Pure Sushi! We sat on the outdoor patio since it wasn't too cold (plus the heaters warmed us right up). We were dressed pretty casual, which I was a little nervous about when I got closer to the ultra modern, trendy decor but the service was fabulous! The In & Out Roll, I fell in love with and can't wait to have again. We also had the Lobster Roll and a few different types of sashimi- all were great! Next time I want to try the White Monster Roll. We also enjoyed some sake and The OC martini was great!! Definitely recommend Pure Sushi.

I will definitely be visiting this place again very, very soon. Maybe even today! Haha.   My sister and I wanted a quick lunch somewhere close and really glad we picked this place. We sat inside next to the fully open doors to the patio- which I loved since there was a nice breeze.   My sis ordered the fish tacos for an app- I took a bite, they were okay, nothing special. The slaw on the side seemed a bit off. I started with the Potato and Leek soup... and it was sooo yummy! I am already craving it again! Next I ordered the Reuben. Wow, another smart choice! The bread was toasted perfectly, the meat was tasty and the perfect temp and the cheese was melted just to the right point. My sis ordered the fish and chips. The fish was great, very moist and lots of it! Plus, it wasn't over fried or greasy which is always what I look for first. The chips aka fries were good, but tasted a bit bland.  The service was also good... friendly and attentive! All in all a great place to eat and also watch sports considering all the tv's!

One of my favorite places to dine in North Scottsdale. I've dined here about 7-8 times- for work and play. I'll never forget a special mushroom soup they offered on my first visit. Since then I've always had a great experience, from the service to the food. My favorites: the Calamari, Chopped Chicken Salad, the Ahi (when it's available), the Scallops, and usually any special they offer. However, I have mixed feelings with the new Bar North. The bartenders weren't friendly-on all 3 occasions. The atmosphere however, I did applaud. Modern, yet comfy and easy to spend a good night with friends!

Fish tacos are oh so amazing!!!  I have to eat here at least once a week. The food is fresh. The prices are fair. The guys are great. Everything I've tried has been excellent! I love the habanero salsa too- nice and hot!  Look, some people complain that they wait too long for their food to be prepared. If you want FAST food then try Burger King down the road. I'll wait 10 minutes for my fresh food.  As far as service... they are all so friendly! I always have a great time here!

Hey!!! Let's have a ton of fat with a tiny bit of rib meat for dinner!  Sorry this place won't last long. I wasn't expecting too much since it seemed ordinary but - wish I would have looked it up on YELP before I ventured over. It was just a stupid mistake after a quick trip to the nearby Target.   I really don't know what to say cause at heart, I'm a nice person who likes to give people the benefit of doubt. But really, I have NOTHING nice to say about this place. I would give it zero stars if I could. Yeah, it's that bad.  Sat at the outdoor bar area to order takeout, no water misters in over 103 degree weather?? Okay fine I can deal with that.  ... Then it was just downhill from there. Tried to order my food, let's just say I don't even want to bother describing that ordeal.   Finally got my bill, the waitress had of course put in the wrong order, but it was about the size of the rib order and type of side so I was over it cause I knew it would take too long to fix and hey, it's a 'pig' restaurant, a few more ribs won't hurt; the boys will eat them! Yea right, they ate one and were done.   This is where this review will end, very very shortly. The ribs, the salad, the fries, the sides, the 'tacos', were all so horrible. Horrible.

Love, Love, Love JJ's!!  We've been here a few times and will definitely be found here many more mornings to come!   The staff is charming in the friendly way that makes you want to eat here every morning!  The food is pretty decent too. I always order an Iced Vanilla Latte to start off with. I don't know what it is but I can't seem to try anything else because it's so yummy!  The Denver omelette is my fav... it's always filled with a good amount of 'stuffings'. They put the cheese on the top too- which is the way I like it, otherwise I feel like I'm just eating a pound of cheese if it's mixed in like other places. It comes with toast or a bagel and a side. So of course I get a bagel for the bf  to enjoy with his meal and fruit for myself. By the way, the bagels are sooo soft and chewy. We probably won't be going back to Einstein's anytime soon.  The sandwiches are so yummy too! They all taste so fresh. The bread seems like it just came out of the oven, meat just sliced and lettuce just cut! Although, my one dislike is I think the chicken salad is a bit on the sweet side.  It tends to be on the pricey side but for the amount, service and quality you receive I don't mind paying a few extra dollars!
