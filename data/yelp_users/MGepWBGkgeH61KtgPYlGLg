MOLD MOLD MOLD! I wish I could give less than a 1 star review. Unfortunately my wife and I lived there for 4 years. We moved apartments because they were doing "renovations". They continually raise rent even though their vacancy is very high. Our new neighbors after we moved (whom we shared a wall with) had to change apartments due to mold. I repeatedly asked if there was a mold problem and / or if they could come in and check. They said they would, each time, and never did. We had roof rats! They sent a person in and cut a hole directly above our bed!!! TO CATCH RATS THEY CUT A HOLE ABOVE OUR BED! They never fixed that problem. The bark park is constantly flooded. And the kicker is, upon move out, we find mold. I have pictures of it... and instead of recognizing any of these problems, or even sending us a final bill... they sent us to collections for $423.42. DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES MOVE IN TO THIS PROPERTY! I will be completely transparent about this so if you have any questions about Camden Legacy, please contact me at jyargs@gmail.com.

I have know Larry for several years now through BNI and other professional networking events. I have sat down with him on multiple occasions to talk about his experience in advising entrepreneurs, and am thoroughly impressed. His knowledge in running a successful business comes from his first hand experience managing and owning restaurants and other businesses. If you are looking for a knowledgeable professional to help you improve your company, Larry is your guy.
