First time at this location last night .  We went late in the evening and had a party of 3.  Got some drinks at the bar which was fine and then sat and waited for our table .  It was quite humid and hot where we were waiting as the air vent was dripping cause the humidity .  While we waited , not one person came to check on us or tell us why it was taking so long to be seated .  We finally were sat a table in the back after 25 min or so waiting .  Took approx 10 min before we had anyone come take our order .  We all ordered fairly simple food and only 1 time did anyone come to us to offer drinks .  We sat for nearly 45-50 min waiting patiently for our food and once we got it , no apologies or explanation.as to why it took so long .   We all had pretty much lost or apatite and barely even 10 min after getting our food , had our server come to us and ask us if we wanted desert (seriously lady ??!?) As we were waiting for our check the manager ( older lady with a raspy quick tone) was across from us , apologizing to another couple that was waiting nearly as long as us , for the wait .  No one came and asked how we were or how our service was or apologized for the delay .  Needless to say we paid and left dissatisfied and upset .  I have eaten at the old town location countless times and have always had superb service and food .  We will most likely not be returning to this location .

I recently had a less than satisfactory experience while visiting this Oregano's .  Shortly after I visited , I wrote a review and was kindly contacted by Kristen M.  I was given an opportunity to come back and last night I took them up on this offer .  I was sat at the exact same table and was immediately impressed .  Our waiter (Chico) was extremely pleasant and prompt.  He came by several times to check on us did an excellent job at stating on top of our food and drinks.  We were all pleased and will definitely be coming back .  Thanks Oteganos for doing the right thing and for getting me to come back .

Over all cool place with good food .  It is what I would consider to be a bit hyped and way to busy to be enjoyable on a consistent basis .   The food usually has a good quality and is not greasy and well cooked and they will always take care of any issues but it's over priced for what you get .  I recently went for breakfast and got the "big breakfast " which has 2 sausage 2 bacon some pancakes and eggs and potatoes which is a lot of food but it's still $10 and then $2 for a coffee ( which the coffee was definitely Burnt ).  The manager is always kind to us and we generally like the place when we have more time than normal to wait in line and a bit extra to pay since $30 for breakfast for 2 is costly ( in my opinion ) .  That said its worth checking out if your in the area and want that home cooked but not overtly grimy food .

I was really hungry and feeling some good food that was tasty and not a greasy cheeseburger or burrito.  I have always been a fan of Mediterranean or middle eastern food so I figured I would give this ace a chance .   I called to place a pick up order and was greeting by a kind , gentle spoken man . I ordered the chicken schwarma and a side of hummus .  When I went to pick it up , the restaurant was extremely clean and quite intimate.  The gentleman that took my order on the phone was kind and well dressed and spoken .   I paid and took my food home .  I was starving !! I got  home and sat down to some of the best food I have had in a while .  The hummus was slightly garlicky and smooth (not to oily) . The chicken schwarma was incredible and had these little red pepper/pickles and the chicken was perfectly cooked and extremely tasty and tender .  Overall I was extremely impressed and will be coming back for sure .

Come with low expectations .   I came here one time and was good and figured we would come again .. I was sadly let down time and time again .  I came with expectations of the same experience and wanted simply a lemon ice with vanilla soft serve and was met with a response of " the machine stopped working for the joe-lati" what else can I get you .. In frustration I got just a lemon ice and left .  ( also word to wise , they won't give you a sample in the drive through .. Only if you go inside .. ) So wanting to give em another try I called ahead ( being that I live a bit of a distance ) and Cooper said " oh there nothing wrong with the machine , it's working great " I told him that I had came before and it was not working and he said he wasn't sure why it wasn't working before .  So we drive over after I got off the phone and came inside and started to order and then , I was told " the machine just stopped working ".. I was pretty upset and told them I called and they told me it just broke after I got off the phone .. Needless to say I was upset and was not offered anything like a free item or anything ...most likely won't come here again .. Best head to Rita's Italian ice ,  they are cheaper and never have issues !!

First and Foremost....this place is great! I just want to get that out there before anyone thinks I am trying to be a negative Nancy...This place popped up seemingly out of the blue and is in my old neighborhood .  It has great atmosphere , simple menu and great drink offerings (including beer and wine) .  Seating is really cool and simple, this is a "Fast Casual" dining experience, so you will order your food, get a number and be given your drink and they bring the food to you. My wife and I both ordered the same thing " The Roast" Pannini which has several heaping slices of mid-rare steak with cheese and a creamy horseradish sauce. I had regular fries and my wife had sweet potato fries.  The bread was amazing and perfectly grilled. Everything  else was up to par and tasty (nearly perfect)  with ONE exception...The steak was totally bland nd lacked all seasoning on both mine and my wifes .  That said, there was plenty there and they had plenty of extra hot sauces available that helped give it a bit more season.  For the price, and quality, I give this place a 4 out of 5 stars and we will deff be returning (prob often ).  Note to the chef , work on that seasoning the steak.

Overpriced for what you get . Ordered 2 slices and a ranch side and it was 7.30$ . Also I know for sure I have been to another location and had a slice and boneless wings with drink combo and it was reasonable but they told me they don't have that here and never have ... After I ordered , they came out after a few min and told me that they had to remake the pizzas cause they ran out and it would be 15 more minutes ... Needless to say , if you are close to Venezia's , I would go there and get a real slice .  Sorry but I'm just being honest .  As for the pizza itself is decent ( tends to have a bit of cornmeal but decent flavor ) I'm just hungry   Side note , I heard 2 customers indicate the soda machine tasted like chemical ...

Yummy and to the point !  Stuff is pretty spicy here so just ask them if you aren't sure .  Thai coffee is good too !

Sobas is a great place for "fast casual" Asian "fusionish" healthier versions of food .  Ok I know that sounds long and confusing but this place isn't as simple as calling it a "Ramen Place " or "Fusion Asian " but what I can tell you is that the food is impeccable and amazing ! The food itself has a healthier feel and taste without compromising flavor .  It is not heavy or fatty .  Oh and they have Bao BUNS !!  Myself and my wife went on a Sunday after Church and I ordered Yakisoba with Pork Belly and she ordered Ramen with Chicken .  Both were cooked perfectly and beautifully displayed .  They were not overtly salty or greasy and the veggies were fresh and crisp .  We also had ordered regular BAO buns with side of crispy  brussel sprouts , but there was a miss communication and it got missed ( we didn't pay and I didn't notice ) but the manager politely and graciously got us an order and took care of us !  ( NOTE : the Bao buns are spicy !! But tasty like really really tasty !! ). We also got Chai Milk tea with boba and and regular green ice tea and both were perfect ! The chai was lightly sweetened and the boba tasty as expected !   Overall we were quite delighted and felt the whole experience was enjoyable.    The only complaint I have is not really something they are doing wrong but I have to say it.  My only issue with this place is the COST $$$ it's quite pricy ( 9$ for buns and side of brusselsprouts ... ) and 10$ for Yakisoba bowl with pork belly .. So you could order entree for you , your spouse and 2'drinks and maybe an app( bao) and it will be nearly 40$ which for a fast causal place is a bit much but not unheard of .   Over all I really enjoyed and felt the price was on par for the most part but it's not somewhere we can afford to eat at more than 1 time a month or every few months
