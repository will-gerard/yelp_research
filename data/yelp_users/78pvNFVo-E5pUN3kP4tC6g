Great beef, great bread, great sausage. It is a bit greasy and the fried zucchini leaves a bit to be desired, but overall it is incredible. If you are a fan of Chicago style Italian sandwiches then stop by Luke's. Try the tamale if you're feeling ironic or just go with the beef and sausage combo with sweet peppers if you want a juicy kick in the mouth.

The ribs are okay, but the ambiance is lacking and not in a kitschy hip way, but in a you're gonna get robbed way.

The masa is perfect. The sweet is perfectly sweet and the savory just right. The meat is well seasoned. Great Tamales.

Music is too loud (obnoxious) and the internet sucks, slow. I love Starbucks but at night this more like a nightclub, but you know without the people. Currently using my phone to tether just to do the homework I can barely do because it is so friggin loud here. But this is just the humble opinion of one gold card holder.

This place is awesome for the craft brew lover. Not only are the Nimbus beers fantastic but they are not too pretentious to deny other Brews a spotlight. Right now they have Ska Brewing's Modus Hoperandi as one of their many guest brews. Great food too.
