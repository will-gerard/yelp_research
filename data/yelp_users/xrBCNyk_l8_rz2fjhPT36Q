My friends dragged me here one time. It was a sobering experience where I learned what it means to be objectified.  The bar is sorta dirty, but points to them for having access to a food truck from their patio.  Interesting note, it seems like everyone has a "gay lisp" at Charlie's.  Not my type of place. Maybe I'm the wrong demographic?.

When I moved from Flagstaff to Tempe I was disappointed that I would be leaving one of my favorite northern spots for deals on craft beer and liqueur, but the worries were unsubstantiated, as Top's Liquor usurped my #1 spot for liquor and beer.  Top's beer selections is vast and they have plenty of unique brews, like the specialties bombers from Rogue (not many places carry sriracha beer) and Trappist imports. If you are here and are overwhelmed, then the deals will help guide your shopping. And these aren't just low-level, guide-your-eye-deals, they are really worth the visit. I have bought gluten-free beer bombers for $2 a pop, plenty of mid-range beer packs that average to about a buck per single, and I recently got 4 Lambics for $10. The wine and liquor have equally great selections and deals. This is smaller than Total Wine and More, but I like Top's a lot more.  Their adjacent bar also is worth a visit with their large tap and occasional events.

Not my cup of tea. I came here after a long day of business hoping to avoid the old Denny's fall back, but I think I actually would of preferred to eat at the classic dinner. The food at Eli's was only okay, service was poor (but passable because I was in no rush), and there was a band playing oldies which made the environment different than I would like. I suppose it's not bad as a bar, I was under the impression it was more than that and came to eat, which at my current state was a mistake.

Great selection of beer. Nice environment consisting of the bar, a few tables, and comfortable couches.  Rarely is it too crowded. This is the perfect spot for a quiet drink on weekdays. You can even buy a drink from the adjacent liquor shop Tops and pay a small cover to byob, meaning your beer options are endless thanks to the liquor shops aisles of beer.

I like the people who work at this Walmart more then average, but the lines are always too long. Come to this Walmart night of day and there will only be maybe 2 lanes opens and you'll be waiting at least 10 minutes to check out.

Getting food at Pieology is always a welcome delight. I'm not huge on the make-your-own pizza concept, but as far as it goes, the chandler and 101 pieology does well.  I always feel like I get a well-sized portion and the "pizza-crafters" are excellent at advising my creations and preventing potential flavor combination doomsdays. The real thing of note however, is the people. Joshua (the manager, I think) and Collin served as a reminder tonight as to why i keep returning to pieology. Colin is always chipper, making me feel like a friend as he makes my food, and Joshua makes sure I'm having a great experience and checks in at my table to make sure everything is perfect. As said, make-your-own-pizza is so-so to me, so I guess you could say the people are what make this place great. Regarding environment, the place has a welcome wide-open feel and is super clean. Great quality food and positive people make chandler pieology a great place to study excellent food service.
