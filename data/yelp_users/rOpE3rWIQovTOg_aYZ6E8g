We actually really enjoy the food but like every typical Chinese food place they are cheap with continents I ordered 4 takeout meals and they gave me 2 chili containers I asked for extra and she wanted to charge me I honestly spend a good amount of money here and can't believe she wanted to charge me for extra chili we will never go back again cause the customer service sucks

If there was 0stars I would pick it the manager Tiffany has a bad attitude it obvious when people hate there job they have no customer service skills the honey tea ran out told me it takes 25 min to prepare so went to get lemonade and it was out also I told her and she added a out of service sign then said the reason the tea was out was because customers usually don't get it and when she prepared my subs I asked for one more meatball cause there was more bread then meat told me I had to pay double I was ok with that but she just seemed really rude the whole time on top of that this subway was sloppy messy and I won't go back
