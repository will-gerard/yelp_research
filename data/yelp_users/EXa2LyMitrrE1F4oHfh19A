We've lived here about 6 months - couldn't be happier. LOVE the grounds like walking the dog through a park. Nice people, pet friendly, safe. Great staff, well maintained grounds. For an inexpensive apartment it is far better than we imagined. Occasional noise, but nothing crazy, just the to be expected noise from living in an apartment complex. Overall very happy.

Okay overall still very happy, however, had our first issue. The laundry went out for the entire complex. One week - okay - went of on vacation - three weeks late still not working. It took 3 weeks to fix the situation. They kept telling us days and that it had never happened before, but that doesn't really matter as your laundry is piling up now. They offered nothing to help - it wasn't a huge issue for us, but many people ride the bus or bike for them this was almost impossible. They needed to offer some service or something for the residence - nothing.

Update : iIt's' been almost 3 years since the "laundry" incident and the situation never happened again. Overall very very happy. I think it's a great community. Walking distance to coffee shops, parks, grocery. I literally park the car every weekend. No crime. Nice down to earth residents mostly working class and students.

Always a good time, but yes there is a too drink minimum and yes you will pay too much for the drinks. This is still (even with that) always a good time and well worth the cost. Come mentally prepared to add $20- $30 per person and just enjoy it! Live comedy is the best!

Wow so yummy! Family style so don't over order. We took a lot home, but it was worth it. Fair pricing, excellent food and some entertainment ie you get to watch the noodles being made. This is a great casual dining experience.

If you have been shopping anywhere else for a bra - STOP this place is it. Service amazing - I was actually fitted and for the first time in my life - no shoulder pain! Had no idea my bras were hurting me before I found Belle Lacet. I made the mistake of trying to go to the big chain again, starts with a "V" - uhm lets just say they failed the test and were nowhere as good as Belle Lacet - I'm a forever Belle Lecet gal!

First off Instruction and environment are top notch. If you have been doing yoga in Tempe or Arizona you will recognize these top notch instructors. Next, the studio is cozy and peaceful with plant and the soft cork flooring (which shocked me actually DOES make help).   This really feels like a family an inviting family. I would invite anyone to try it out - pretty sure you will fall in love as I did.

My planet fitness experience was ok for a while. You get you what you pay for no classes, pool, ect.  I had always been happy as a member (started before they opened). Last week I had a truly disappointing customer service experience with "Max". The service was so bad and attitude was so rude that I left the gym and stopped my membership that day. Now that I'm at another gym I realize what I was missing: classes, no mixed messages (ie they give you pizza at Planet and have candy out- no really they do), and customer service with experienced gym professionals. I'm really happy Max gave poor service because for $10 more a month I get so much more...

Never again.  Pros: front office staff and medical assistant were friendly and professional.   Con: awful nurse practitioner. He was very rude and sarcastic. I think mid way he realized he was too rude and was somewhat better, but wow he was over the line for me.    Nobody wants to be in an urgent situation and thankfully we have had very few. This experience was the worst. I had to give a very low score because we came seeking a PA NP DO or MD with some professionalism. The rest of the office can be as nice as pie, but they can not give medical advice. That is why I gave such a low score despite the professional staff. We were disappointed. To top things off it looks like we will have another urgent care run or hospital run as this practitioner did not come close to resolving this problem and wouldn't you know it it's Saturday.   There is plenty of competition out there - go elsewhere.
