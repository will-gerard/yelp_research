The food was too spicy to enjoy. The service was slow. The restaurant wasn't busy so we couldn't figure out what was taking so long. Raylie (sp?) was our server. She wasn't friendly. I asked for a side of retried beans, they brought black beans.  it took awhile to get out drinks and food. Great atmosphere. But we won't be coming back. We had a party of 12 so the 20% gratuity was a must and she was lucky. She didn't deserve that good of a tip.

This Taco Bell is going down hill. Very slow in getting your order. The manager doesn't speak to his employees with respect. It's a bummer because it's the only one close to me.

This place has great sushi for a good price. Great selection of wine. Best crab rangoons anywhere! I recommend the hory fook roll.

The manager Brent is awesome! He really takes care of his regulars! The chicken tacos are the best. You really need to try the rustic margarita! Great happy hour prices! We have been here another time and it was great as this time. So happy to come again! Great place!
