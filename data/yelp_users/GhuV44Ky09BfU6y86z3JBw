They make some good food at time. But this time lechon paksiw was so disappointing. We had to wait for about 10 mins expecting something good. But instead we are given something that's so sweet, made with lechon kawali instead of lechon. worst food ever... tasted like all they did was put all the sweet they can find in there kitchen...   I would recommend there sinigang and that's it. Everything else is not as good compare to other filipino food that I have tasted.   The food was so bad that I even considered that McDonald was where better than this place... that says alot!!!

The worst experience I have ever eaten. Been here few times and keep giving them a chance to make my meal experience better but after I come back here, I regret giving a chance and wasted my money and time for a food that doest even know how to cook a simple breakfast burrito.   my bf and I went and order there breakfast burrito (steak,egg,and potato) it was the tasteless food I have ever eaten. No flavor at all. I had to put alot of hot sauce and lots of ketchup just to add flavor to my food. The food was horrible...   Don't ever come to this filiberto!! You would regret it....
