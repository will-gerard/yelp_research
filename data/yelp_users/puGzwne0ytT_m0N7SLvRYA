I love this place.  It has a small menu.  But what it does have is really good.  I always get the mozzarella, basil, & tomato sandwich.  It is so delicious.  Pane Bianco can be a little hard to find the first time, but it is definitely worth seeking out.

I am a big fan of Torrid!  The clothes and accessories are cute, fun, and trendy.  However, I have always been able to find basics (i.e. tanks, tees, cardigans, blazers).  Most people would not consider me plus-sized; I wear a size 8/10 pants, but  I am a big chested girl.   The size 0 and 12 tops fit me perfectly.  And when they have sales, they have great sales!!!!

I really like this place. They have great martinis and margaritas. I agrees with Nancy J., the pomegranate is YUMMY! I'm not the biggest hummus fan (but I LOVE chickpeas, go figure), but it's really good there. The hummus has a nice spicy punch to it and the bread served with it is nice on its own . I have had most of the salads and they have all been tasty . Fez has a very modern, cool, urban atmosphere but is very relaxed. Their staff is friendly and you can actually talk to your party without having to shout over loud music.

I am another who does not understand the hype about this diner. I have been there twice.  I have had the waffles and hash browns.   The waffles were soggy and the hash browns were very greasy (both times).  I could have done that at home without the 45 minute wait.  Plus, the coffee is putrid.

For being a chain restaurant, Pappadeaux is pretty good.  For an appetizer, I usually have the Blackened Shrimp & Crawfish Fondeaux or the Lump Crab & Spinach Dip;  both are luscious and come with French bread.  My two favorite entrees are the Crawfish Etouffee with white rice and the Pontchartrain Panbroiled Fillet.  My adult beverage of choice is the Swamp Thing.  I do not know what is in it but it is quite tasty and pretty to look at (Yes, I'm a girl!).  I have never had dessert;  have always been too full.  However, my sister and nephew swear by the banana pudding which is served in a Mason jar (Ick!).  The only real draw back  to Pappadeaux is the wait for a table.  No matter when I have gone, the wait has always been at least an hour.
