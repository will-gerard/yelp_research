Pane Bianco is one of my favorite pizza places in the valley.  I know it is the little sister to Pizzeria Bianco, but this was the first restaurant we tried and it has become our favorite.    The pizzas are brick oven style.  The crust (which is great!) is very thin and perfectly cooked with maybe a slight amount of char.  The sauce and topping combinations that they serve are all great.  The margerita pizza is our favorite.  I also really enjoy their Rosa pizza, and I usually despise onions!  The Biancoverde is also great.  You really can't go wrong with a pizza.  Once, we had an amazing vegetarian lasagna.  It was light with lots of veggies in it.  More recently, we ordered the lasagna on the menu, but it was much richer with TONS of cheese.  It was good, but not as good as what we had previously had.    Great place to eat on Central & I've never had to wait.  Thanks!

LGO is a great, feel good place to spend an afternoon.  I've never brought someone who didn't find something to like about this place!    A tip: Pull into the Postino's parking lot & valet your car!  It is free (with gratuity, of course) and much easier than trying to find parking in the front.  Then, you can walk around to the front of the store or cut through the back entrance.  There are some small tables in the grocery store portion as well as plenty of tables in the restaurant portion.  During the day, you order in the grocery store, find a table, and wait for your food to be served.  In the evenings, you are seated in the restaurant portion and have a server to help with the ordering.  There isn't much I don't like about this place.  There are cute trinkets to look at while you are waiting for your food (or if you want to hang around after).  There is a dog-friendly patio out back.  All of the food is pretty much stellar - this is NOT going to be the MOST amazing meal of your life, but its pretty darn good for brunch.  Their pizzas are some of my favorite in the valley!  I highly recommend!  You can also pick out beer or bottles of wine from the grocery store to accompany your meal.    Note: There is an LGO at the airport as well - this is my MOST frequented airport meal because it is AWESOME for airport food.  As a vegetarian with many meat-eating family/friends, this place has a great selection for all types of eaters!

Postino Arcadia is one of my top choices for Sunday brunch.  Don't get me wrong - you can definitely go and have a rocking time for evening cocktails and snacks, but I think they shine the brightest for Sunday brunch.  If I'm in this area in the evening, we'll usually grab pizza from LGO instead.  First of all, the portions are great - some fancier places serve small brunch portions which can leave you a little hungry, but you won't have that issue at Postino.  Do yourself a favor and start with the farmhouse scone.  I'm not a huge scone fan, but this one is perfection.  My go-to meals are the grilled focaccia or the smoked salmon.  Order one (or both) - neither will disappoint!  For drinks, you can get french press coffee or treat yourself and have a mimosa or bellini ($5 each).  The atmosphere is very friendly (sit outside if you can) and the service is great.  I highly recommend this place (unless you arrive before me and take my table)!  Also, there is free valet during busier hours!

I can't believe how underwhelmed I was when I initially visited Hiro.  Since that time, it has become one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona.  Besides more "fast food" type options, Hiro is one of our most frequented dining experiences and a constant reservation when we have guests.    One thing that you have to get past, is that it is in a strip mall.  The overall atmosphere when you first arrive leaves a little to be desired.  Once you enter, you are transported to a completely different area.  This does not feel like Arizona (especially Scottsdale) once inside.  It is small and dark and smells like sushi.  Sitting at the sushi bar is a must-do if you are there as a couple.  It is fun to interact with the employees making sushi.    We typically order the salmon skin roll (try it - its awesome!), the veggie roll (also great!), some sort of salmon nigiri, the tofu agedashi (another thing I highly recommend to anyone) and whatever sort of nigiri they recommend to us that night.  We have tried all sorts of non-menu items including fermented soybean rolls (not sure the actual name for that).  If you have any favorites, just ask, they always seem very willing to accommodate people's whims.  I also insist on the moshi before we go.  I'm sure its nothing special in terms of moshi in general, but its a favorite dessert of mine!    One tip - if you are interested in going, you will want a reservation.  If you can't (or don't) get one, you will likely have to wait or you may even get turned away if they have no tables opening up.  You cannot reserve the sushi bar - its first come first served, but its still typically a decent wait as well.  Reservations are definitely recommended and worth it!  If you can't get in, try Andreoli's across the street!

This is my most frequented grocery store!  If Whole Foods was closer (and maybe a bit less expensive), then I'd maybe skip out on Sprouts.  As is, this is the closest grocery store to my house.  The fresh produce is usually pretty good and the prices typically can't be beat.  The one draw-back is the lack of inexpensive frozen foods.  Expect to pay 1.5-2X the amount you would pay for a frozen pizza at Fry's.  Also, you may have to be creative when stopping in for "junk" food (hint - yogurt covered strawberries, natural twizzlers, & pop chips are my most frequented).  I cook primarily vegan, and I rarely have difficulty finding the ingredients I need here.  So glad its in the neighborhood & quick for frequent trips!

Chipotle is chipotle, right? This is pretty much the closest "fast food" that I'm willing to eat near home...which means we frequent this establishment.  It gets busy on occasion, but the employees are nice and friendly.  If anything, I'd say that they are generous with their portions, when compared to other Chipotles.  Even with a line, you are usually in and out the door within 5 minutes.  If you need coffee/sweats, you can pop in the Starbucks next door or the Chompies across the parking lot!

By far, the best Mexican food I've had so far in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Yum!  First, their chips and salsas rock.  The perfect amount of kick.  There was a menudo on special, which our waitress recommended but let us try a cup before ordering.  It was ok, but you could tell what you were eating.  I'm glad I tried it, but not my lunch of choice.  I ended up ordering an enchilada dish - 2 mole enchiladas and one with a green sauce.  I was not impressed with the green sauce - it seemed to be VERY heavy on the cilantro, but I LOVED the chicken mole enchiladas.  Yum!  Also was served with rice & beans and they were great.  My boyfriend had two different tacos off the menu, he thought they were both OK but nothing too great.  He did tell me that he had the barbacoa there in the past and LOVED it, but I will have to take his word on it.  It doesn't look so great on the outside, but I would definitely recommend this to others and I will definitely be back!

I have been to Las Glorias twice with people from work.  Both times I was underwhelmed.  The first time I went the service was good.  They were great about bringing out chips with salsa and bean dip and refilling drinks.  The second time I came the service was horrible.  We were there for over 1.5 hours because we had to wait for EVERYTHING and it was not very busy.  I was not impressed with the food.  They seem to put raw onions in everything, including the cheese enchiladas.  I really dislike raw onions and am a pro at finding dishes without them, but you cannot escape them here.  The rice and beans were good, but I cannot say much else for a positive about this place.  I will not be back!

I found this place on Yelp and likely won't be hitting up any other auto repair shop.    My boyfriend and I both have old cars...and are reluctant to buy new ones (car payment?? No thank you!).  The issue with older cars is that there are plenty of things that can be fixed.  I always frequented the Honda dealership in the past.  They would take hours and then tell me $1000+ of repairs that were needed.  When one of my error lights turned on the day after I had a repair done at a dealership (who then denied any responsibility for the issue), I was finished.  I found Whiteys on Yelp and have been using them ever since.    While the location isn't the most convenient, they let you drop your car off the night before & put your keys through their drop box.  As long as you have an extra set of keys at home, you can also pick up your car when they are closed.  This makes things very easy with our crazy schedules!  The biggest reason that we go here is that they are honest.  They will tell you everything that is likely wrong with your car and then give you an honest opinion about what NEEDS to be fixed and what doesn't.  This is helpful to me since I don't know (or want to know) very much about cars.    The prices are fair or even a bit low compared to what I expect to spend.  Thank you for your great service - I hope nothing ever changes!

I was in during the holidays to FINALLY get my hair cut.  This is something that I constantly procrastinate about.  It had been almost 18 months since my last cut (oops!).  My stylist was great.  I had already shampooed that day, so she rinsed & conditioned my hair and gave me a lengthy scalp massage.  I was interested in bangs, but based on my morning routine (shower, towel dry, brush), she didn't recommend them & I followed her advice.  I may have to suck it up and commit to more morning prep time, as I'm STILL thinking about them!  I hadn't found a stylist/salon in Scottsdale that I cared to go back to, but I'll be back here!   I have fairly long, straight hair & Nicole was great!  She was easy to chat with and did a great job with my hair.  Thank you!

Cafe Lalibela is great!  I've only had Ethiopian at one other restaurant (in DC), but as far as I can tell, this place rocks!  We order the vegetarian platter.  I'm a pretty picky eater, but have no issues and love trying EVERYTHING in the platter!  The service is great - I've been here on weeknights as well as weekends and they always seat us quickly and the service is superb.  The injera is amazing - order extra!

Had a great New Years Eve dinner here!  We met friends (one of whom did all of the ordering), or else I probably wouldn't have picked this place.  The service was great & all of the food I tried was great.  I especially recommend the okra dish - great flavors!  The rice pilaf and naans were also nice.  I recommend that you try this for a quick meal if you are in the area.  I likely won't make a trip back unless I'm in this neighborhood!

Went to AZ 88 recently while in Scottsdale and was not disappointed.  We sat outside at lunchtime while there was music playing in the park.  I should note that anytime I can eat outdoors (I live in Chicago so this is not a usual thing) it bumps the whole experience up for me.  The decor was pretty trendy and modern.  I must say to try out the (women's) bathroom as I thought it was pretty cool.  The service was quick (once our waiter found his way to our table) and my boyfriend and I spilt one of the sandwiches (chicken, bacon, avocado) and for 2.50 (I think) we each got our own basket with fries and fresh fruit/veggies.  I would give it a higher rating but the food was only good (maybe it was our food choice) and they put mayo on the sandwich after I asked for it to be on the side.  Also they serve a soda in a small glass bottle which is one of my pet peeves.  Just give me a normal sized soda!  Overall good experience and I would definitely recommend if you are in the Old Town area.

JW Marriott Desert Ridge is a great place to stay in the North Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  This is especially true if you have children who love to swim.  There is a great pool area with several pools, a splash pad, and a lazy river.  There are several restaurants to check-out on location as well.  I only wish that JW Marriott Desert Ridge was more centrally located to enjoy - it is a bit of a drive from other attractions!

Pita Jungle is our go-to place for quick service.  The wait is typically short and the staff is usually quite attentive.  The food is always either good or great.  My current favorite dish is the quinoa salad on the specials menu - I get plain hummus with quinoa, kale, and other goodies on top with a side of pitas.  The soups are also amazing and many are vegan!  We've brought many picky out-of-town guests, and everyone is always able to find something they enjoy!  The happy hour is great as well!

I drove here after work one day in search of berbere and hopefully some injera.  They did not disappoint.  I walked up and down the spice row reading EVERY label, looking for the berbere.  I finally asked an employee (and showed her the written word), who then looked in the dried berries and told me they were out.  I was thinking about the wasted trip, but finally decided to check out the bread aisle before I left to see if there was injera.  Score!  I bought the best whole wheat injera I've ever had.  And what was located in big containers right about the injera?  Berbere!  Success!  I now have probably a years worth...but need to work on preparing my own injera because this is not the most convenient location for me.  The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, but nothing to worrisome for a female shopping alone after work.

We went here instead of waiting out a table at True Foods.  I typically do not eat Chinese food - I'm more of a fan of Japanese or Thai.  I went here with family - who seemed happy with their lunches.  I ordered the Eggplant dish (one of the few vegetarian options).  It was ok - the sauce was very thick and salty - not really to my taste.  It was OK, but definitely not something I would want to try again.  I'd recommend sticking out the wait at True Foods or another restaurant in the area.

I really wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised by Yasu Sushi Bistro!  Newly moved from Scottsdale to Phoenix, I am in desperate need of new neighborhood eats.  We had our "go-to" sushi place in Scottsdale (Hiro), but haven't found much in our new neighborhood until we tried Yasu Sushi Bistro.    The location doesn't seem like much from the outside - located near PV mall in a strip mall that has a Circle K and a smoke shop.  But this is typical for Arizona, so don't let that affect your decision to try this place out.  We came on a Saturday evening around 8PM.  There were only a few other couples dining.  Our waiter was attentive and knew the menu well.  He made great suggestions were were always very helpful to our ordering.  We ordered a few items off of their special menu as well as the Bistro cold udon (amazing!).  We were pleasantly surprised by each dish - all were great and all will be ordered again on a future trip. I'm happy to say I've found my new sushi spot!

You can't really beat this theater for a great movie experience.  Here's what you need to know:  1.  You park in the back (I believe its off of 24th st).  Get a ticket from the parking garage and then have it validated before you leave.  The parking is free! 2.  If you exit the parking garage on the 1st floor, you need to take the escalator up to the second level.  This threw me off the first time. 3.  You can purchase your ticket and reserve your seat head of time!  This is great for opening weekends. 4.  There is a full menu and drink list.  I'm still a sucker for the popcorn though! 5.  Saturday afternoons are more inexpensive than evening shows - something to keep in mind if you are on a budget! 6.  The seats are big & comfy and have a little side table for your food drinks!

Had a great car buying experience.  We went through Costco auto and were directed to Kareem at Right Honda.  As this was the second new Honda we purchased this year, I can definitely say that the car buying experience at Right Honda and with Kareem is much more pleasant than at other dealerships.  Kareem was knowledgeable and easy going - definitely no pressure.  We test drove the car (Honda CRV EX all wheel drive) on Tuesday and returned on Wednesday to buy.  We got a fair price on my trade-in and also on the car.  Kareem was easy to communicate with through text as well.  Thank you!

I've seen some mixed reviews for Andreoli's.  Let me set you straight: this is an authentic, family-owned place.  If you come somewhat regularly (you should!), you will recognize the same people each time.  Some of the younger employees seem to have a little bit of an attitude, but most of the staff are very attentive and authentic and truly want you to have a great experience.  There is brick-oven pizza on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  I've had this on two separate occasions and had quite different experiences.  The first time it was great, the second time the crust was a bit soggy.  I think they were simply busy and didn't leave it in long enough.    What I keep coming back for are the sandwiches.  They are amazing and also have great vegetarian options.  I highly recommend the eggplant sandwich, even if you typically eat meat.  Its great!  The calamari (both the friend and grilled) are also great if you eat fish!    They have several different beer and bottles of wine you can purchase, or you can choose a glass of the house wine.  Come early if you don't want to wait.  Otherwise, come for lunch!  Always order coffee and dessert -its definitely worth it!

SanTan is one of my favorite local beers to purchase at the store, so of course I'm going to be a fan of their restaurant!  My biggest issue is that there are not the greatest number of vegetarian options on the menu.  I had fish tacos the most recent time we visited, which were okay.  Nothing too special.  The veggie burger is also pretty standard.  What I love most about SanTan is their appetizers (the pretzel!) and beer.  I've heard great things about some of their burgers, but I cannot vouch for them!  Great local place - wish it were closer to home!

We had a nice time at the Luminarias at the Desert Botanical Gardens.  We lucked out to have tickets on a warm evening with a full moon.  There were a lot of people there, but I wouldn't say that it was crowded.  This could be because we went on a member's only night.  I'd highly recommend this, if its an option for you!  The musical guests were great.  I had a nice time stopping to listen at each station.  The lights were pretty and not over-done.  I'm not sure we'll make this an annual thing, but it was a nice experience this year!

I stopped in after running the RNR Marathon this past weekend.  I ordered a Clever of the guji from the board.  Overall, it was a pretty good cup of coffee.  Not my favorite (I'm a huge yirgacheffe fan), but good.  I also tried the cherry pop-tart, which was amazing!  I highly recommend!  Great neighborhood coffee shop.  I'll definitely stop back in if I'm in the area again!

Great for vegetarians!  Try the mushrooms!  We've hit up Pars a couple of times when we were stuck in a food rut.  Both times I was very impressed with the experience.  The decor leaves a bit to be desired - it is very dated inside and quite small and dark.  The wine list was also a bit of a drag - pretty cheap selections and nothing unique.  Instead, I had a beer with dinner.  The two of us ordered:  Vegetarian Platter (Dolmeh, Maust' Khiar & Hummus) and the Oyster Mushroom Kebab to split.  My boyfriend is HUGE eater, and we were stuffed by the end of the meal - I definitely recommend splitting unless you love leftovers.    Great food - we will definitely be back the next time we can't decide where to head in our neighborhood!

I don't normally have a sweet tooth...but I could come here every day!  Yum!  So happy to have been introduced to this place that is a mere 5 minutes from my house!    First, they let you try each flavor in typical Baskin Robbins fashion.  So for those that want to TRY avacado/jalepeno but do not want a full scoop then you can go for it.  I recommend the strawberry buttermilk and anything with caramel in it.  Can't wait to go back!

This location for Pita Jungle was pretty true to the others I've been to.  I had the lentil soup & added a side of grilled tofu.  It was standard - very flavorful & vegan!  There are many options that you can get that aren't on the menu - simply ask your server!

I've been to Gallo Blanco several times.  At first, we loved coming because the food was good and they had a superb happy hour.  For us, the trip to Gallo Blanco is a 30+ minute trip, so we have somewhat high expectations.  I'm not sure if the chef or owner or something changed, but we headed here last month and had the worst experience.  The front house staff was rude to us.  The bartender was the same.  Our waitress was OK, but very inattentive.  These things I can ignore, but the food was awful.  My boyfriend's torta was reportedly good, but all of the tacos that our group ordered were cold and the fish was tough.  Further, they forgot part of our order and never took it off of our bill.  Very disappointing.  We will not be back!

My boyfriend and I were hesitant to go on our hot air balloon ride that we received a year ago for Christmas, but finally booked it the last weekend we were in town before the holidays this year.  I'm so glad that we went ahead with the flight!  Besides the initial take-off, I had no fears and really had an excellent morning.  We are even considering booking a private trip at some point when the family is in town!  Patrick was our pilot - he was engaging and really great to be around.  We took off at the same time/location as a couple of different balloon companies, but I really felt like we were in the best hands.  Everything about the trip was handled professionally and it was a great addition to our holiday festivities.  You have my highest recommendations!

Yeah, I got suckered into Buffalo Wild Wings after a running event with some friends.  Haven't been since college...and hope not to be back!  I don't eat chicken, so maybe that was my problem.  I had some buffalo chips & popcorn shrimp.  I'm pretty sure frozen foods from the grocery store baked in my oven would have been just as good.  Others from my table (who ordered wings and such) were also complaining, so it wasn't just me.  Save your $ and head elsewhere for a quick bite to eat!

We hired Phoenix Carpet Repair & Cleaning when moving out of the apartment we rented for the past 4 years.  The carpet had a ton of pulling/folding (which we learned was from poor installation) as well as a few spots where our cat licked the carpet into tufts.  I was able to get a same week appointment.  The man who came to clean the carpet was on time (big plus!) and efficient in his work.  He not only stretched the carpet, but also cleaned the carpet and repaired the lick spots (he trimmed it much better than we were able to prior to the cleaning).  The carpet looked brand new when he was finished!    The house we just moved into has carpet in one room which is in need of cleaning - and I know who we will be calling!

Soi 4 is the best Thai food I've had in Phoenix. My boyfriend an I are vegetarian, and there are many choices for us here. We love the turnip cakes as an appetizer. All of the main dishes we have tried have been awesome as well!  The service is always great and there is typically no wait!  I definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in the Scottsdale area!

We tried Perk Eatery this weekend and were very disappointed.  I was with 2 others who were also very new to AZ, so we picked the restaurant based solely on online reviews.  I was nervous upon arrived based on the 'grand opening' sign out front.  I'm not sure when Perk Eatery opened, but new places always seem to be hit or miss.  Let me say that our server was awesome.  He was very friendly and very quick.  No complaints there.  However, the food was OK at best and for 8.99 + drink a person my expectations were a bit higher.  I got the biscuits & gravy that was on special.  They were fine (I've had much better), but I did NOT enjoy the rosemary potatoes.  The rosemary was overpowering and the potatoes were mushy, not crispy.  My boyfriend got some sort of omelet and our friend had the pancakes.  None of us were thrilled... Save your money or go elsewhere!

This is my favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale!  Every time we have visited (and its been a lot!), the food has been consistently good.    Please note, there is often a wait on the weekends for breakfast!  There is a coffee place in the same lot (Village Coffee), where you can go grab a drink to help pass the time while you enjoy the gorgeous Scottsdale weather.  It could be worse, people!  I almost always get the same thing - Eggs Rojo or Verde but get it Ying/Yang (half/half).  Its my favorite and I can't order anything else!  I always try to snag a bite of something sweet from one of my fellow diners.    The prices are fair - definitely not as expensive as many Scottsdale brunch menus.  Definitely give this a try - or don't to keep the lines shorter!

Your experience really depends on who is working when you arrive.  One time that I came the barista was enthusiastic and helpful.  The second time, the person working literally did not speak to us.  It was quite awkward.  Overall, cartel sells great beans and makes a great cup of coffee.  Its not always a great experience though.

This review is for their "Taco Tuesday" - $1.50 selected tacos.  I ordered 3 tacos - all crispy.  I tried the roasted vegetable (my favorite!!), the tempura fish (pretty good), and the beans and cheese (just okay).  The service was quick and the food was good and very inexpensive.  I'll definitely be back for a quick & cheap lunch!  Great vegetarian tacos at an awesome price!

Fate is great for microbrews and brick-oven pizza.  All of the pizzas that I've tried (vegetarian) have been pretty great.  The olive appetizer is also nice.  Lots of microbrews on tap as well as some local brews.  No wait (at least not so far), so that is a plus during the cool months.  I'm hoping this can remain a somewhat unknown neighborhood joint!

If I were reviewing Federal Pizza for the food only, I'd bring my review up to a 4 star.  That being said, we had a weird experience here last weekend.  We arrived around 6:30 after being told this was a good time to arrive (no reservations for parties under 8 people).  We had just under this amount and were told it would likely be short wait.  Well, after a 30+ minute drive, we were told we had a 2 hour wait.  After some smooth talking, it was shortened to 60 minutes and we agreed to stay.    Fast forward 90 minutes and we were still waiting for a table.  In general, it was a big deal, its to be expected in a pre-summer weekend.   The next issue was the service.  I found the front staff and servers to be a bit pretentious.  This is a big pet peeve of mine.  No one deserves to be talked down to.  Our waiter was nice in general, but was very inattentive.  Several parts of our order were messed up or not even brought to our tables.  When we asked about this, they acted annoyed.    The food was good - we ordered 2 veggie pizzas and 2 meat pizzas.  As a vegetarian, I only tried the veggie pizzas, but they were legit.  The appetizers & drinks were ok.  Again, things were forgotten so I can't give a whole review.  If you're close by & want pizza, perhaps give it a try.  If its the weekend, you're better of trying somewhere else.  The Phoenix area has so many great pizza places that I don't recommend wasting your time at a place that is more pretentious than it is delicious.

Paying for pain - Ouch!  That could be my entire review, but I'll elaborate.    I have thought about getting a Brazilian many times before, but never followed through.  Before a trip to Maui, I decided to bite the bullet and get one so that I wouldn't have to shave while there.    The booking process was painless.  You can make an appointment online, which is fabulous!  No one wants to be the one calling to talk about waxing while at work!    I booked with Taylor, mainly because she had availability at the day/time I wanted in Scottsdale.  I would have preferred Courtenay or D'Lisa, as I saw so many reviews about them, but I was on a time crunch so took what I could get and am so happy that I did.    I won't say that the entire experience was pleasant for me...it hurt!  I'm not sure I anticipated how much it would hurt!  But Taylor was efficient and honest about what to expect and the process was completed quickly!  I had a little bit of redness the first day, but it quickly went away!  I had no issues during my entire trip, which was nice as shaving + salt water is unpleasant!    Taylor recommended that I go back in about 4 weeks for my next appointment and I plan on doing it.  Two weeks later & I'm just now starting to have some growth back.  I'd love to keep this going!  Thanks for making an awkward experience as enjoyable as it can be!  Props to Taylor for the speedy service & for keeping me calm during the process!

Warning: I'm pretty much a vegetarian!  I do eat fish on occasions (so I've tried a bite of the ahi tuna burger), but please realize my review is biased.   Let me tell you - the salads here rock!  I like the Caesar salad the best - topped with fried potato straws and chickpeas!  Yum!!  The strawberry arugula salad is also pretty amazing, but a little too sweet for my salad tastes.   They have a nice beer list and serve them in frozen mugs - they really hit the spot. Also the fries are to die for.   Not the nicest place in town or the cheapest...but it does the trick!

I was hesitant to try Pomo, but now I'm not sure why we waited!  You can make reservations easily on Open Table, which is a huge plus in the busy Scottsdale market.  We have never had to wait for a table here!  The pizzas are excellent and have large portions.  The salads are also great.  Try saving room for dessert - the tiramisu is excellent!

I think Ingo's deserves 4.5 stars, but I'm holding off on 5 for now.  We came in on a Saturday, close to closing.  While many places act put off, we were never rushed and were given quite good service.  Thank you!  INGO's is located across from LGO and gives you another option if the waits are too long across the street.  We ordered the deviled eggs (yum!) and chips (also yum!) as appetizers.  Definitely get these starters - they rocked!  I had the kale/quinoa salad with a tuna patty.  Next time, I'd opt out of the fish addition, but this salad was quite tasty and will remind you of LGO's salad, if you've had that.  My friend ordered the brown rice bowl, which I would consider for next time.  Very rich and hearty.  I want to make these meals at home every day!  The boys got the white fish club sandwiches and were quite happy with their choices.  All food was devoured quickly!  We finished with ice cream cookie sandwiches.  Not the best desert ever, but a nice, sweet, finish.    We'll definitely be back!

Ugh.  I wanted to love or at least highly like this place, but I can't!  I came in on a weekday to get coffee beans because it is very close to the parking structure I use at work.  The space is tiny - I actually had to wait in line outside of the door before making it inside.  The service seemed slow - which is to be expected for single pour over coffees.  This part didn't bother me...but the fact that the person taking orders was also the person making coffee was hard to wrap my head around.  I had to wait for the 5 people in front of me to think out their orders, order, pay, and then have the employee make their orders before I could buy my bag of beans.  This was annoying (as was the conversation of said 5 people that I had to listen to while waiting).  The beans themselves (once brewed at home - using a french press as recommended as well as a chemex) were OK, but definitely not the best bean you can get in Phoenix.  Will stick to Cartel when I need to buy beans close to ASU.

We couldn't make up our mind last night about where to go and found this place on yelp.  Third restaurant in this location since we moved to Arizona, which wasn't that long ago!  When I saw that it was the same owners as grassroots (somewhere we were considering but had a 30 min wait), I insisted we try it.  We arrived around 8:45 on a Friday night and were seated immediately.  There were plenty of others there, but not having to wait was nice. Overall, the service was a bit slow for my tastes, but it wasn't bad.   The food was all pretty good. We ordered a ton for 3 people and had a bunch of leftovers. Sad, because I wanted dessert!  My favorite was the grouper sandwich- best fish sandwich I remember having!  I also really enjoyed the grits. I ended up taking most of my noodle salad home, but I'm looking forward to having it for lunch today!  Overall, good experience. I hope this one makes it so there are more close-by restaurants that we like. We will definitely be back!

Ok, I'll probably be back and update my review...hoping for the best. I was very excited for this place to open - donuts right along my walk in to work?  Perfection!  I stopped in this am and they explained the whole process to me. I love cake donuts so was pretty stoked. I ordered a pretty simple one with sprinkles. Got a cute little to go box to carry to my office. I was ready for this thing - but my first reaction was that it tasted greasy. I am totally into an unhealthy breakfast on occasion, but I don't want it to taste like grease!  I'm hoping this was a fluke (maybe it cooked too long so picked up too much grease??) and will try again in a few weeks to see if it improves. Otherwise I'll be hitting up one of the other breakfast places on the block!
