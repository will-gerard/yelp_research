Great food selections made of high quality ingredients. I know I am getting handmade meals of fresh, real food, not food/like products. Everyone is super nice. They have Customer service right. Hummus and tabouli are amazing as well as gazpacho.

Seriously the worst interaction with owner. I am on vacation and decide to get mani/pedi. Halfway through I realize that I left my credit card holder where I was staying on Tempe. I ASKED 2 of the techs to check out my purse since my nails were wet. Neither found it. I immediately told my guy who IGNORED me. Then the other lady calls owner to tell her I won't pay. The owner begins to accuse me of intentionally going in there to steal her services and not pay. She wants me to leave my IPhone while I go get money. She keeps telling me by yelling I'm lying. Mind you, $30 (from my wallet is on counter). I call a friend who is on her way over to pay. Meanwhile owner calls cops (not kidding). Cops listen to her rant then point out that if I was intentionally planning to rip them off I would NOT be sitting inside calmly reading a magazine. Owner kept saying "She lie. She lie." Cop said I can't do anything about it. She can leave now without paying and you can't do anything. My friend came, paid and we went to the movies. At least I have a great vacation story. When I move back I will find a new nail place. Overpriced and zero customer service. Truly the worst place ever.
