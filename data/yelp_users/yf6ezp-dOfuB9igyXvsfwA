So, I'm walking out to my car after a long day at work. I reach into my purse to grab my phone and SMASH! My link to the rest of the world is cracked and, well let's face it, my day has been ruined. That my friends was me last Friday. *tear* So, why am I happy now? Let's read on.   I fortunately have a super smart sister that told me how to keep my face and fingers from being sliced to bits from the broken glass (scotch tape guys... Miracle quick fix). Then I was off to find the real repair. I called around to a few places. One place in particular was across the street from me. I walk in and they want $120.00 for the repair and one whole day to fix it! WHA?!?! Not happening. So, I dig a little more.   I called Sun Cellular. Dan needed to order the part, but he could do it for $5 less and in 30-45 min. Works for me!! So, today I go in. He has the part and he gets right to work  I feel I should note here that this guy is friendly and very professional. Super props to that!! Anyway, 10 MINUTES LATER I have my phone back. And she's purrrrdy!   This was the best repair experience I have ever had! I was so please with the way this business conducts itself and how awesome the service was. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! 5 stars all the way from me.

This has to be one of those times where it was just a bad day. I want to believe that, I truly do. But what happened needs to be addressed.  First off, I've been here before. I came here with my husband, his brother, and the brothers bf. We had an absolute FABULOUS time. Our server was attentive,  kind, and charming. The food was hot and fresh, and our drinks were never empty... That was the first time.  This time could not have been more opposite. First, no one was a designated host/hostess. So, servers would come outside, ask how many people were in a party, then disappear. And this would happen more than once so now there are two or more servers looking for a table. Often for different parties, so you can imagine the confusion. When we were finally seated we were pointed to the general direction of the table and asked to sit. And sit we did for 10 minutes without water or menus. Not even a run by from the server to let us know that he will be right with us. Nada. At the 10 minute mark menus were all but thrown at us by a server. Still no communication.   Then our server, Elijah I believe greeted us about 5 minutes later. He took our drink order and our brunch order, since we had more than enough time to decide, and ran off. Our drinks came 10 minutes later, along with no eye contact and a muttering of "I'll have your croissants in a minutes". 30 minutes later, no joke, we got our croissants. They were cold and hard as rocks on the ends and did not come with the preserves they generally come with. Then 5 minutes later came our cheese plate. And then 20 minutes after that my husband got his ham and gruyere omelet and I got a plate of something that was not my order. I had the runner take it back and continued to wait for my plate. Thankfully I only had to wait a couple additional minutes for my Niçoise salad. Salad people.   Also, please keep in mind during that whole time, not once did the server come back. My husband had long since been out if iced tea and my mimosa glass was empty :(. We received not quite refills about 5 minutes after we received our plates. Meaning a carafe of tea was handed to my husband to serve himself and sparkling wine (half of a mimosa) was poured into my glass without a word spoken.   I will conclude with this. It was busy, but I have been a server before. I know what running around like a mad person looks like and what flat out ignoring a table looks like. Our server was chatting up other tables, so he obviously wasn't too rushed, right? We left a nice tip because we are nice people, but we will not be going through that again. Sorry Vincent's, you lost not only my husband and I, but our families as well. It's too bad.

I don't like writing negative reviews. Especially when I go somewhere on a holiday like today. Places are packed, and servers are normally stressed. I let A LOT slide. But this was different.  1. We made a reservation for 1pm days in advance. We were told that would not be a problem. I got there at 1 and we were seated at 130. Even if it's a holiday, you need to make sure those that have called ahead are seated promptly.   2. Our server, Matt B. was, for lack of a better term, aloof. I truly felt from him that by simply being there, ordering food, and asking that our checks be split (4 ways w/7 guests), we were truly a burden to him. He at one point walked around our table looking at our drinks (I assume, otherwise I have no clue why he would walk around the table silent), saw I had an empty glass, and then proceeded to walk away. I at that point had to ask for a refill (I'm not above asking, but I thought he was looking, and it certainly wasn't busy). He said "ok" and came back and filled it up. Look, if it was busy (where we were, it wasnt), and he looked frazzled I would not be writing this. He was calm, relaxed, and just DID NOT CARE.   3. The food also was nothing to write home about, and I usually LOVE Fox concepts restaurants.  The pizza was, pizza. Good, not great. The zucca chips were once again, good but not great.   All in all, everyone at the table agreed that this was one of the worst service experiences they've had. I don't intend to come back, and the 6 others in my party agreed that they won't return either. Sorry North, I really had high hopes here.

I'm a white girl that loves her Persian food!! Yummmmmm... And ZK Grill (formerly Zaytoon) has got it down!  The Food: Let's start with the most important thing about a restaurant, the food. The food at ZK Grill is very fresh. The meat is always tender and delicious ( I particularly like the lamb). They have traditional Persian food like Koobideh, Hummus, and various Kabobs, They also have daily specials like Zereshk Polo with Chicken, Baghali Polo with Lamb Shank, and Ghormeh Sabzy. If you have never tried Persian food, then I would advise to start here. For first timers I usually suggest the Koobideh plate. It is a ground beef kabob with various spices with saffron basmati rice and a grilled tomato. You can also trade out the rice for a salad. If you also want dessert, you can never go wrong with the Saffron Ice Cream. With hints of saffron and rose water, this ice cream is a true treat.  Atmosphere: They recently updated the décor and it looks nice. It's not too cramped, and it's always very clean. I have zero complaints about it's appearance.  Service: The service here is always amazing. I have never once had an issue. No one is rude, ever. This is a place where you order your food at the counter, If you are dining in, they will happily bring the food to your table. I usually take my food to go, which is also very prompt.   Conclusion: I am giving ZK Grill 5 stars because the food is excellent, the service is wonderful, and the place is clean and spacious. I hope you enjoy ZK Grill as much as I have. :)

I have to say, I have never really been much of a breakfast person. With that said, Matt's Big Breakfast may change that. Why? Well, let's get crackin'! :)  The Food:  First and foremost, let's talk about the menu. It's small, but covers all you bfast must haves. Eggs to ham, oatmeal to waffles, they have you covered. They even have a big bowl of Frosted Flakes on the menu (ummmmm yum!). I got the Hog and Chick, which is two eggs any way, bacon or sausage, hashbrowns or homefries, with toast and homemade strawberry preserves. I got my eggs over easy, and I mention this becausemost places can't seem to make them right, but Matt's made them perfectly! The homefries were delish, and the toast and preserves made my tummy VERY happy.The only problem I had was with the bacon, too peppery. That is a personal preference though.   The Service: The service was good. It took about 30 min to be seated, which is to be expected. It allowed time for me to walk around a bit and chat it up with my friend. So no complaints there. Our server (and I feel terrible because I can't remember her name) was very sweet and attentive. Only towards the end did her service become slow, but the drinks and food came out in a respectable amount of time.   The Atmosphere: It is a smaller establishment, so its a little "cozy", but don't let that scare you away. Everyone is there to enjoy a good breakfast, so you're in good company. :) It's decor simple. It's pretty contemporary. It's very clean as well.   The Verdict: Matt's Big Breakfast is awesome! Worth the wait, and worth the trip downtown. I gave Matt's 4 stars because I wasn't a fan of the super peppery bacon, and the service got a little slow at the end. Other than those two, everything else was great! I will be returning, and with friends.
