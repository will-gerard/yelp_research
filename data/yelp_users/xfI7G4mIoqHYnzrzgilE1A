I've been here since 9/21/14. My first two months have been extremely quiet, people friendly, grounds well kept and bug free. My place is partially upgraded nicely and is fair for the price. I love the location-Zipps Sports Grill, Grass Roots, Butters, Coffee joints, Chipotle, Jimmy Johns, an Indian Restaurant and TCBY. The Green Belt bike path will take you to Temp Town Lake. You rarely are on any roads with cars, so it's safe. 4.5 miles to old town which you can bike the canal. If you are having fun in Old Town, it's an $11 Uber ride. I'm sure there are noisier places in the community, but my place is great so far. Thankfully not many smokers around me either. The last two places which I reviewed were hell on earth in comparison. Oh yeah, the few minor issues I've had were handled immediately.

Convenient and easy place for shipping, fingerprinting and mailing services. It acts as a physical address if you rent a mailbox. Last, if you're lucky Killer the Yorkie may be holding down the fort.

Great specials throughout the day and on weekends. Very nice TV's and atmosphere. They run a tight and consistent ship. You won't be holding a table of 10 for an hour with only a few people present. The food is well above average for a bar and priced fairly and below the valley average, especially the happy hour pricing. 32 oz beer under $4, win!

This place is great. Good coffee, food and people. Music weekend mornings is a bonus. Get a rewards card if you come often.

I give it a 1 for location because I have to. I've been here less than a month and everything I've read, I've experienced so far. Car window smashed the first week. Fire alarms went off for an hour tonight. I've seen 1 cockroach in bathtub. My car was backed into and dented. This is a great area but not a great place to live. I unfortunately moved here sight unseen as I was confidentily reassured by the staff (Alex) that these complaints weren't true. They've all happened to me so far. Only 12 months to go, joy. Positives: nice pool, above average fitness facility for an apartment community and some good people. Live and learn, this will be a 13 month experience.  I wrote the above blurb after the first month but never posted and didn't expect to see it here, so kind of interesting to add the full review below with a one month review. After 5 months I couldn't take it anymore and paid $1200 to get out of my lease and my full review below.  This place is bad news. Where to start? First week my window was smashed on my Tahoe and nothing was stolen, just $260 to replace it. Second, someone backed into my front bumper causing a nice dent. Fortunately, I have a 2002 so I'm not concerned about needing it fixed. There isn't much parking, making you park in unlit or unprotected areas. I believe the safest area is up by the tennis courts. It was inconvenient, but the problems stopped except for the dent.  In my 5 months of a 13 month lease, I paid $1200 to get out of here early. The parking is tight, you will get door dings.  The community has useless security guards that basically lock the pool doors. A mouse is more intimidating.   I've heard the fire alarms go off 4 times from drunks in the middle of the night. I've seen two cockroaches in my apartment and they were huge. The garbage area literally almost made me puke in unit E (if you must live here, make sure it isn't by a garbage room). I'd say 50% of residents pick up after their dogs, so crap everywhere. The water pressure in my unit was horrible. The heat and air conditioning is controlled by management. I had to keep my sliding glass door open at night because it was unbearably hot. I had a smoker above and to the left of me so I got to inhale there smoke because I had to leave the door open so I didn't melt. The laundry facilities are NASTY. The water just stands in the machines. If you go inside a machine and shake it you will hear the recycled water. Always check the dryer as people before you don't care about leaving nasty hairs or other nasty stuff behind. Two units in E were constantly broken. The cost is $1.25 and you have to use a laundry card. You lose it and it is $25 to replace. If you don't use it alll upon leaving, the next tenant thanks you.   Your only option for television is DirecTV. The maximum lease you can sign is a 13 month lease, the minimum contract with DirecTV is a 24 month agreement. Getting out of that contract was a nightmare. I typically get contracts when you have a choice, here the equipment is installed and you have no choice. Yet, DirecTV will give you the BS line that they have to account for equipment costs. I am moving into a residence that already has DirecTV and they still didn't let me out of the contract.   Last, I went to turn in my keys today thinking I had paid my rent Jan 1 thinking it was good through my early move out date of 2/6. Nope, and no bill. I find out today I had a $178 worth of rent for 6 days, a $50 late fee and another $40 in $10 a day accruals.   The community leasing agents will act like they care, but they know they work for a terrible management company with no sympathy for honest mistakes. They kind of just go silent when confronted and pray you walk away. There hands are tied. Two of them are easy to find. they are always outside smoking. Last, I moved in sight unseen over the internet. I was handed my keys and never even given a tour. I had to find everything on my own. The only good thing about it I guess is the location, but I'd find a different location to live in the area. If you want to live in a dorm style community, this is the place. I have lived in many communities over the years and I've never left a place on a sour note. This is the worst 5 months of living I've ever had.  Pro's: Location, Gym is decent for an apartment community, nice pool, convenient store. I will not say price because it all adds up in misery.

This place is probably my favorite coffee in AZ. The people working are very friendly and helpful. They have a nice food selection, not the best but nothing more than I expect. I would probably come more if they had breakfast sandwiches. Anyway, the place is great, the coffee fires you up as good coffee should and the people watching us above average being situated at the corner of Thomas and 68th. Enjoy!

I love this gym. It is clean and offers towel service at no additional cost. They have a ton of class options for free and a fee. I read a post about the front end service and customer service being horrible, I completely disagree. I play games trying to sneak out with them not catching me to say have a nice day, rarely happens.   I observe the personal trainers and they always seem really nice. I often see their victims getting a great workout, I have to high five them sometimes.   My only complaint is no locations in Arcadia/Biltmore area, that would be great. I've been to four locations and I feel the same level of consistency and friendliness at each location.  I frequent Scottsdale Pavillions the most. I wish they had a referral fee as I have brought a few friends to the gym.  The child service offerings are great for parents, coming from a person with no children. The date nights and many other offerings can really help a single parent get some things done and a married couple have a nice Friday night out.  Having worked out for 20+ years, I don't think you'll find a better valued gym.

This is a great hike with excellent views of the entire valley. If you take no breaks it's about an hour and a half from where you park on Invergordon at a easy walking pace. It typically takes about 10 minutes of walking to get started on the trailhead. I always tell people to bring more water than you think. There are no facilities so make sure you use the restroom before you arrive.  They allow dogs on Cholla trail, don't forget their water and poop bags. Up to the saddle it's pretty easy, after the saddle it gets a little steep and tricky. Overall it's a fun hike and in strictly rating it on that as 5 stars. I've done it enough that parking being difficult and no restrooms is part of the challenge. Enjoy!

Great coffee, atmosphere and food. They have wine, beer and open mic evenings. All the necessities in life; beer/wine, food, water and music.

I have been without hot water approximately 6 times. The last time, It was 2 days without communication from management since the day they said it would be off only one day, it went on 4 days.  Bed bugs 3 apartments down that supposedly were in the ducts from the apartment above. Broken pipes, music from cars that rattle windows late night, 3 episodes of cops coming for domestic violence, snuck a $25 increase after 6 months (my fault for not being thorough in lease, but shady) and never had a phone call returned when leaving a message. Thank god it's cheap to live here because it's exactly that! I've been here since 10/1/13.   A resident just moved out (already planned) in August.  She and her husband were car jacked at the Thomas entrance. A women was blocking the gate with her car. The husband got out of the car to ask her to move. She got out of her car to assault him and her male friend jumped over the wall to help in the assault. The wife got out to help her husband and they let it go and they stole their car. When they left for Minnesota a few days later, the car wasn't found.   The gate has been broken for close to a month now, so it isn't really a gated community. The place is full of potholes and needs to be resurfaced. This place has more smokers than non smokers. I can't enjoy my patio. I smell a fair amount of marihuana on a regular basis, at least that smells better than cigarette smoke.  Everyone that was here before me, is gone. To my right, left and above.   The apartments once inside are nicely updated, priced fairly and few problems. Water pressure isn't great, but I could have replaced the shower head which likely would have helped.  The grounds are decent, like any dog community we have lazy tenants that don't pick up their crap. The garbage dumpsters are often over flowing. If the maintenance guy isn't on site, it won't get cleaned up. You would think the leasing office would want to clean it up themselves, nope.   Anyway, it's a decent location and priced accordingly. If you smoke, you'll love it. If you don't and you are an indoor person year round, this place is better than most anywhere west to 44th street.

Not perfect, but easy and efficient. I have the speed pass which is great, especially in monsoon season. The people always have big smiles when guiding and helping you out.
