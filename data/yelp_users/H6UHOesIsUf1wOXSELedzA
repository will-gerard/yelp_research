Place has great food! Service was slow due to how busy it was but well worth the wait.  Highly recommended place for breakfast!

Absolutely love this place! Every time we come in we sit at the bar and get greeted instantly. I don't remember the guy's name (he gives it every time) but he is on point.   Food is pretty good and quickly brought out! I would recommend anything on the menu in which I've never had a bad meal. Give this place a go and you won't be disappointed!

K O'Donnells is definitely the place to be! When it comes to food, this place has everything! You can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Not only do they have the stellar food, they have an award winning doggy patio! I bring my dog very frequently to socialize with other dogs. If your looking for a stellar happy hour come in from 3-7 and get some food and ice cold beers! You can't go wrong with the daily specials and those speciality martini's!

This place such a great atmosphere with the live music and the excellent service by rob the bartender. I would say this is a hidden gem of Scottsdale. If your looking for an excellent entree get the Southwest meatloaf! By far one of the best meals I've had to this day. Check this place out because the drinks are strong and the food is excellent!

This place is very close for my girlfriend and I so we visit here pretty frequently. This place has a great menu and kind of a Midwest feel based on the decor (way to update the decor in which it looks great). The service on the other hand can be kind of slow at times which this place wasn't busy the last time we went. Our server was very friendly and pleasant when waiting on us. He looked a little nervous in which this could possibly be his first serving job? Overall experience was good and the food is always worth the wait.

Don't go to this place!!!! Had a small get together and they don't except returns after 7 days even if it is UNOPENED!!!!! This company should probably rethink their policy of products if it is unopened. To make it better the old grandpa supposedly helping me when I walked in didn't even move behind the far counter while I stood at the closest register by the door. I had to walk over to him to get his attention. Maybe scanning the store would be a good idea while customers are in the store. You have lost my business for life.

This place definitely was a great stop while getting my car looked at. Thanks Eddie for the recommendation!  When I first walked in Dukes this place was busy for lunch. I walked into the bar and took a seat. I was immediately greeted by a nice lady. She handed me a menu and I was a little overwhelmed with how big it was. I quickly scanned it and saw they had a breaded pork tenderloin! Coming from the Midwest this is a staple I had very frequently coming from Iowa. I placed my order and realized they had a ton of TVs! My food arrived very quickly and I destroyed the pork tenderloin and tator tots! This place was a quick in and out for lunch while the staff was very friendly! They checked on me over 10 times start to finish. Thanks for the great service and excellent food!

I will just start off with this place is amazing! The quality of food and portion sizes are very fair based on the prices. The bartender Alyssa was very helpful on helping me choose a meal for myself. Thanks for the great service and another great meal!

Yesterday was my birthday and I was looking forward to trying The Strand. My girlfriend heard from many of her friends that this place has the best Italian food around. We arrived at 8:42 pm in which the hostess told us they were closing in 15 minutes. I was ok with that and told her to seat us still in which they don't close till 9. The hostess then proceed to tell us they were on a limited menu until they close. I asked her why in which we are paying customers. My girlfriend and I decided we didn't feel welcomed at The Strand so we left.  This is when the manager or hostess went crazy. When we were outside talking about how rude she was, she came out and started being very defensive. We explained to her if the sign says 9 then stay open till 9 serving guests. She kept making excuses that the staff wanted to go home. I told her to close at 8:30 then. She then said "Come on in then, you get what you wanted." She was screaming this in a very defensive manner in which we felt threatened.  My girlfriend and I both work in the customer service industry. I have stayed open later just to make that customer happy. That's part of the job. For the lady that treated us with so much disrespect, she shouldn't work anywhere around people with those customer service skills.

I will say I absolutely love this place. I come here at least twice a week in which I always get a pizza and a pookie to go. Every time time has been a pleasant experience except for tonight.  I came in 15 mins before they close and one of the cooks decided to mumble "fucking customers need to go away because were closing". I literally walked in when I heard him say this. This is very unprofessional. I work in the service industry and even though I sometimes get frustrated, I have never spoke like that on the floor especially in front of customers.   Word of this wise, if customers didn't come in you would be out of a job bud.

Shopped at this location and it was a pretty good setup. Shoe palace had a very good selection. I purchase a Jordan hoodie and left pretty satisfied for a Xmas gift for my brother.   I looked online at the same hoodie and it was 20 dollars cheaper on champs. I called shoe palace and they DO NOT price match anything. What kind of store doesn't price match to be competitive and satisfy customers? I have worked in sporting sales for ten years and this store lost my business forever. Thanks employee on the phone that was very rude and unhelpful with making me a happy customer.

My girlfriend and I came here for dinner a couple weeks back to check this place out. Overall the experience was pretty good.  Positives from the visit: Huge projector TVs Nice Bar layout Friendly Staff Decor was excellent  Mahi Mahi sandwich was excellent!  Negatives from the visit: Not a lot of items to choose from on the menu 2 of the 3 bartenders looked incompetent (the woman bartender was hustling and working her butt off while the other two looked lost). Way to go blonde bartender!   I would try this place again if they added a few more items to the menu! Sorry to be critical but this is just my honest opinion.
