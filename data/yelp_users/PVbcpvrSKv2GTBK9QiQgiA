OVERPRICED AND OVERRATED!!!!  I cannot believe how much money I spent here for two sandwiches and two sodas.  $25.46  The mozzerlla panini had tasteless tomatoes, the thinnest slice of procutto that had a large peice of fat in it causing me to nearly gag.  Plesto sauce was okay.  The roast beef sandwhich was a huge dissappointement.  Two thick slices of overdone beef, two thick slices of cheese and a tasteless tomatoe with the top hard vine connector still attached (who wants to eat that?).  When I say thick, I mean, 1/6 thick but did not cover from side to side of the bread.    These sandwhiches were $9.50 each!!!!  We got one with pasta salad (corkscrew pasta and a dressing, no veggies or color) and a green salad (lettuce and dressing, nothing else).  We also got two diet cokes.  In a can!!!!  For $2.25 each!!  They did'nt offer a glass, ice and straw which in my oppinion might account for the upcharge, but no, nothing, niet.  This place might be okay if you are in the area, at the building working or visiting someone, but we drove from Ahwatukee.  So not worth it.  Do not drive to this place.  Do not go out of your way for this place.

Have you tried their happy hour?  You should.  I can't believe i like fish in the middle of the desert, don't tell my friends back at home in the bay area.  The tempura calamari is wonderful, please try.  Gyoza is good.  Sushi has plenty of the good stuff - wasabi, makes you feel alive.    Love the music.  Gets kind of loud, so if you're looking for an intimate spot, this is not it.  Good place for a celebration with lots of people though.  Very friendly service.

Big sandwiches.  Big.  Bread is great on a good day and fair when they don't have it fresh.  Mom loves the Philly cheese-steak.  I like the Italian.  I always ask for hot peppers.  Ordering and paying can be a bit confusing.  Best thing to do is to order and immediately go to the cash register to pay.  Otherwise you have your sandwich, you're hungry and then you have to go pay.  I'm not sure how they don"t get ripped off.  It would seem to me it would be easy to order, wait, take and leave.   The chips they offer, name escaping me now, are very good.  I know that at most sandwich places I do not get chips but here I do.  BBQ is my favorite here.

In the Oakland Bay Area Mr. Chao's is synonymous with a Chinese fast food where everything tastes the same.  In Phoenix AZ, it's synonymous with fantastically delicious quality food.  This is a "bistro" located in a strip mall (nothing new for Arizona) that has wonderful mood lighting that is warm and inviting.  The service is friendly and knowledgeable.  The food is awesome.  General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Szechwan String Beans with Chicken and combination fried rice are so very good.  No questionable meat here.  Wonderful spices.  The Chinese Chicken salad has a bite to it that will keep you going back for more and more.  This place is a wonderful go-to for authentic Chinese food that will satisfy all the time.

I don't know where they get the pickles that go in the beef Gyro's but I cannot get enough.  So yummy, I always ask for more.  This place takes me out of the desert and puts me in a much more hip city.  I absolutely love the Tsatziki, full of garlic that you are protected from vampires but cannot kiss another human being until you do a thorough mouth clean up.  Still worth it.  Bad for first date.  Go here.  Eat here.  Your will be pleased.  If not, there might be something wrong with YOU!

I have never been afraid of high prices.  Well, unless its for crap.  But I live by "you get what you pay for" and AJ's delivers.  From the meat to the dairy, its all good.  The deli selection is top quality and you will find meats from around the world here; cheeses too!  And the pre-made salads: pasta, potato and fruit - oh my!  In the deli they offer a salad bar that is bar-none (you like that?, yeah me too).    Do you like beer and have always wanted to try something new without commiting to a full six-pack?  Come here as they offer a wide variety of beers by the single.  Love it, buy the whole pack, hate it? try a different one.  The bakery is top notch.  Exotic cakes and pastries to tantelize any tast bud.  When I go here I always get a Jesuite, it's a french pastry that is flaky, filled with cream and powered with sugar.  So yummy, a must have! add to that a nice chocolate selection.  I love to shop and they have an awesome home section with the cutest and most unique items to make any home sparkle.  If you want to show off how much you care with flowers; you must come here.  AJ's will make you something to impress all!

Wonderful sandwiches, good soup and an amazing salad bar.  Need I write more?  Oh alright, but only because you like to read my crazy quips.  I get the Ruben but prefer mustard over thousand island dressing.  I like corned beef with thousand and pastrami with mustard (just for your knowledge).  The salad bar is amazing.  Different types of lettuce plus spinach.  The normal round of vegetables, beans and fruit. Plus, green olives, I really like green olives.  Many dressings to choose from.  I could swim in their soups, but I wont; for many reasons.  They are thick and flavorful. Hot out of the kettle, no semi-warm soup here.  Itls a sandwich place so do not expect linen table clothes and suited servers.  You pay, get a number and find you're own place to hunker down.  I'm cool with that.  And the best quip for last: FREE ice cream cone.  I don't believe there is anything more that needs to be said.

After watching the show about the next great restaurant or whatever it was called I really have a bad taste in my mouth for the dude that started this company but damnit if he doesn't offer a darn good product.  I really only like the carnitas here.  Steak seems to be hit and miss and I've never been a chicken fan.    Green salsa is the best.  Pinto beans all the way.  Rice with a hint of lemon and cilantro is so darn good.    Try their quesadillas - so yummy.  This location has the friendliest people.

Ahwatukee and Chandler can not have enough Italian restaurants.  That was sarcasm.  So when this one gets four stars its the sign of a good thing.  Items I really like: Appetizers: (my favorite part to any meal) Fried zucchini - thinly sliced and lightly friend with a great dipping sauce. Fried calamari - fresh and again lightly breaded and fried. Must have the spicy pepper and lemon butter sauce.  Must.  Entree's Spiedino Di Mare: Scallops and shrimp are perfectly cooked. Chicken Marsala - wonderful mushrooms and sauce.  I enjoy both their vinegrette and creamy Italian for the salad starter.  I recommend the lenti and sausage soup should you feel like something warm andn spicy.  Very yummy in your tummy.  They are a "scratch" kitchen as they call it, which means they can accommodate any food dislikes or allergies.  It's kind of dark in the dinning area but comfortable.

This is not the place to go if you are in a rush.  If you want to be in and out, do NOT got in.  If you want to walk fast, it's impossible.  But if you're looking for a slow jaunt and don't mind people stopping right in front of you, this is the place for you.  Some decent food places, the usual, plus Nathan's Hot Dogs.  Rain Forrest Cafe can be fun too, but that's a whole different review.

Thank goodness this place is not any closer to me or I might have a very serious problem.  Cinnamon twist, chocolate cake, all things raised and holes.  ALL are great.  The ham and cheese croissant was wonderful for lunch.  Made fresh, like still warm and melt in your mouth fresh.  Do yourself a favor and skip those big name donuts and go taste a real donut treat.

My grandma loved me.  This grandma only offered me . . . . margarine?    Really?  In today's day and age and grandma has no butter?  Its not just about science here, its about taste.  Unfortunately grandma didn't have that either.  The hash-browns were flavorless.  The ham was only cooked on one side.  The french toast had a form of cinnamon in it but it still lacked in flavor, explain to me how that is possible?  I'm still perplexed.  The maple syrup was a far, distant step cousin to anything maple.  The coffee, a measure in any restaurant, was miserably lacking.  We went to Grandma's Kitchen based on the two reviews here on Yelp and I was sadly, sadly misled.  :(

The opening comedian was a doll and a good host throughout.  That's why they get two stars.  "Headliners" we're NOT funny. Because they were supposed to be more"known" than the openers they wasted our time trying to sell us time-shares. Just kidding, they were pushing DVD's and t-shirts we could care less about.  Do NOT order food. Chicken wings were microwaved with slimy skin and rubbery meat. Hummus was tasteless. Pita chips were burnt.  I had a cherry coke and that was good. Could you imagine if they couldn't pull that off? Egads.

Perfection.  You know when you're flying, in an airplane, and you're thumbing thru the airlines magazine and you come across the ad w/ the picture of the perfect filet mignon?  That's Ruth Christ Steakhouse.  Our family has been looking for the perfect filet mignon and found it about 10 years ago here, at Ruth Chris.  So we've been coming here annually for my dad's birthday, also Christmas Eve, ever since.  Perfect meal includes, Appetizer: BBQ shrimp, in a buttery white wine, semi-spicy sauce that will have you licking the plate, or at least asking for more bread to help you look a little more dignified. Salad: Wedge, with perfect crispness iceberg lettuce and a chunky blue cheese. Soup: Lobster Bisque, buttery goodness.  Meal: Filet Mignon medium. Sides: Mashed potatoes perfectly whipped and topped with butter and if it's the holiday time the sweet potatoes casserole is so tempting.  Desert: Crème Brule comes with berries and is the perfect consistency once broken thru hard candied layer.  Now, I will not eat all of that.  I've had all of these, and more, but will only be able to go thru a portion of what's above.  My eyes are way bigger than my stomach at this place.  It's come to where I won't even open the menu as I'm afraid I will drift away from what I usually get and order too much.  This is a long review for me, I'm usually to the point, but there is so much to share about this place.  Mainly the food but not to go unmentioned: the service, spectacular, the wine list, pricey but a wonderful selection and the ambiance, upscale without being too froufrou.  I'm a big fan.

Buttered Buns!    Need I say more?  Yeah sure, why not.  The regular dogs are a good size but if that's not enough for you, they offer a "pounder"!  yikes, not for this gal, but maybe for you.  The Boston dog comes with mustard, relish and onions, which is a good combo in my book.  But then they put the grilled dog and all those condiments in a buttery toasted bun.  Now that's just yummy.  Seriously.  I read another person's review that said the french-fires were too greasy and I must correct that - they are in no way greasy - they were perfect in every way.  Yes to the fries.

Crab in the micraddle of the desert?!!!   i know - right?  Still, the crab pots are great.  They show up at our table and there is a hush for about a half hour as we crack, crack, crack away.  Dungeness crabs are the best, being as I'm from the SF bay area I may be a bit prejudice, but try them all and just try to disagree with me, go ahead, do it.  Fried calamari was good.    Atmosphere is loud and fun.  I enjoy sitting at a table with a bucket right in the middle of the table for shell disposal.  Sat at a picnic bench their once and will NOT do that again, bum was sore afterwards.  Friendly servers.

Seriously?  How have I NOT written a review for one of my favorite places in the valley?  What a great place to start off an evening or close the night out.  It can also be a great place for lunch on one of our fabulous afternoons.  This means the ambiance is perfect in all situations.  Drinks are awesome.  Fully stocked bar.  Great drink menu.  Pricey, but worth it as they do not skimp on the good stuff.  I've tried a lot of their martini's and have enjoyed every single one.  The food here is great.  I go back and then back again for the Burger Au' Prove (burger with peppercorn sauce).  Meat is quality, buns are fresh and the sauce makes that burger mouth-watering wonderful.  Before this I will usually order the civiche or Hell Fire chips for the table.  The chips are fresh and I have been introduced to a wonderful hot sauce called Arizona Gun Slinger.  The civiche is fresh and loaded with shrimp, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and lemon all to be piled onto fresh cooked white tortilla chips.  When I have friends or family in town, this is the place I bring them to.  When I'm celebrating anything, this is the place to do so.

Nice people,  Great Gyros, salads, tzatziki, pitas and the flaming cheese.  I'm there once a week at least for the greek salad with gryo meat and sub the village salad dressing - very tart and oh so yummy.  Casual atmosphere and when we have great weather here sitting outside is most recommended.

Friendly people.  You get to put your own button on your popcorn.  Which is good for me as I'm a butter (flavoring) fan.  Best deal in town for movies.  Great deals Monday thru Thursday and before noon for the other days.  Clean.  If you join their Stubs reward program you get free movies for money spend AND upgrades at the concession stand.  A medium for the price of a small!  Which lets face it is still a rip off but for me, part of the movie experience.

Everything I've had here is wonderful.  The service is wonderful.  The ambiance is comfortable.  They recently added guacamole to the appetizers and I'll tell you what, I think its one of the best ones I've had outside of my own.  I crave the Spit Roasted Turkey Melt.  It really does melt in your mouth.  Wish I had one now.  I've enjoyed the Tomato Gin Soup, Filet Mignon Cobb Salad, Classic French Dip and Rotisserie Chicken Crepes.  All wonderful.  Sides I like: Israeli Couscous, Fresh-Cut Fries and Freshly Mashed Potatoes.

Not impressed.  Dark, which is good because I'm not sure it would pass a health inspection otherwise.  Are fried cheese curds supposed to be chewy like silly putty?  Burger was way over cooked and drrrrryyyyyyyy.  I ordered some state, they name their burgers after states, that had a pepper sauce only it wasn't saucey, explain that please.  Two good points: decent fries and lots of tv's.

Friendly staff.  Great selection.  I've already got two cats but I can't help checking out the cats up for adoption.  I always pray they find great forever homes and can't help but leave with a tear that I can't take them all.  But I'm not ready to be the cat lady just yet and was told if I have more than two cats I'm undateable.  I always give extra money for their pet adoption/care thing.  Makes me feel better.

The salad in my sandwich was a great idea.  Lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pepperoncini tossed in balsamic vinegar, oh my, and then piled onto a fresh roll with ham and salami with mayo and mustard.  Not too bad, I must say.  It is, however, too bad the salami was a cheaper kind and not a dry Italian salami.  It kind of made the sandwich a little salty, but doo-able none the less.  I ordered the pasta salad as a side.  I wont make that mistake again.  It's my understanding that pasta salad will be on the acidic side, usually involving vinegar of some kind.  This pasta salad was not acidic at all.  it included cabbage, carrots, sun-flower seeds and a taste that I still cant place.  It looked like it was a "bus-tub" salad.  I took two bites and gave up, no sense in wasting calories.  Overall, I think this place has potential, but my experience was nothing to write home about, sorry mom.  Fortunately for the rest of you . . . . I'm addicted sharing my experiences: be them bad, good or just so-so, lucky you!!

This place has it all.  Groceries, cleaning supplies, storage containers, toys, home goods and furniture plus electronics.  I guess that's why it's called "Marketplace".  Fry's has always been a good deal in the food department.  I like the deli options.  I especially like the Olive bar that has stuffed grape leaves which is on the high side to me at about $0.50 each as it is charged by weight ($7.99 lb).    Sometimes when all other home goods stores have closed and I just need somewhere to shop or browse I'll come here.  I can't say that I've purchased any big items here, but my friend did and it looks very nice in her home and she got a very good deal.  Two things I'm not impressed with are the check yourself out lane, I like being taken care of but the lanes with actual people are always too long.  A HUGE caveat about this place is the parking lot - i have such anxiety just thinking about it.  It's small and not very well lit, then they recently had the nerve to add a gas station, ugh, not impressed at all.  Please drive slow here.

Went here for a massage from Audrey and she has magic and healing hands. I thought I was going for just a relaxing massage, but then she asked if I had any areas that are bothering me and ended up with a therapeutic healing.  The office has a friendly staff.  The office is clean.

As long as I've been driving I have had my share of windshield replacements and this was by far the best experience.  The product is quality, the workmanship cannot be beat and the service was friendly.  This is my go-to for windshield replacement and who I will always recommend.

I want to be impressed with this place.  I really do.  I will give it one more shot.  I liked the flavor of the green chili, but as with most places there is always too much tortilla and not enough meat or insdies.  Its beans and rice people - fill it up.  The Salsa offerings were okay.  I would have like my tortilla chips when I paid so I could dig in while waiting for my burrito.  I like the decorations, it really fit the type of restaurant.  Burrito Co, if you're reading this - more on the inside will give you less tortilla.  Or you could just rip us off and make the tortillas smaller.

I've often thought that all I really need to sustain in life is bread and salami.  But thats just a pipe dream and if my doctor ever read this he would have a few other things to suggest.  But really, its so simple and yet so good.  Which is Andreoli in a nut-shell.  An Italian deli at its finest.  The salami was quality.  The bread, a perfect baguette, was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Add arugula and some roasted peppers and I'll tell you what you got there . . . . you got big yum!  Yes, its a bit pricey, but the sandwich did come a side salad of fresh romaine and other assorted lettuces tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette with fresh cracked pepper.  A surprise I very much enjoyed.  And frankly, I know where to get a cheap meal but I will happily pay for quality any and every day.  I'm not sure I'll ever be on this side of town again, but if I am, I will keep this place in mind.

Who doesn't love an art festival? - then stop reading this . . . and go turn on your NASCAR, otherwise proceed.  Parking is usually not fantastic at any street festival but Tempe has really beefed that up around Mill Ave.  This year it seems bigger than last, but i suppose that's how its supposed to be.  Both with booths and with people.  Wish there could be lanes to keep walking people organized.  Its hard to view what's in the booth without meeting someone close up who was also trying to get a glimpse of what a booth had to offer.  Stuff that had me interested and I made a purchase with, in case this will tempt you to go to the next one: Nuts, a variety roasted in a plethora of spices and/or sugar, Lemonade, fresh squeezed and re-fillable, Hats, found a Hawaiian beach cap for a baby and his big white bald head sitting in the scolding sun, but I digress, Tiles, hand made into coasters with different landscape designs, Toffee, OMG the best toffee in this valley and for some reason the name is escaping me and I do apologize to the vendor that I purchased it from, I used to get it at my local farmers market, Oh heavens, just know you will find really good toffee there.

The mocha's are made with the most amazing chocolate - egads, I wish I had one now.    I wish this place was local to me - but I certainly make an effort to get there as often as I can.  Thinking about going now . . . who's up for it?

They are first class.  Literally!  They are wide and comfy.  I got their basic pedicure there and am very happy.  I also had some art work done which is very pretty.  The technicians were very friendly and I will be returning very soon.

This is a wonderful place to have lunch or early dinner any day of the week.  Being that it's a bakery the bread, cookies and muffins are very good.  They have sandwiches, fresh tossed salads (tossed right in front of you) and soups.  I enjoy the Tuscan chicken which comes with an olive tapenade that is very yummy, so much so I ask for more.  Fresh chicken, tomatoes, cheese and basil makes it one of my favorites.    Every sandwich or sandwich combo comes with a chocolate chip cookie (this thrill seems to be consistent with me if you've read any of my other reviews).  Every time I think of broccoli cheddar soup I feel like I'm eating cheese sauce, but their version is has slivers of carrots that make me feel just a little bit better.  A little.  Wide open seating, free wifi, great food makes this a great spot to get a bite and stay just a bit longer to lounge and let your food settle in.

They have got the best accessories here. Its like walking into a jewelry box, cool stuff at every nook.  Inexpensive and cute jewelry.  They have colorful and hip bags and shoes.  I love the quirky gifts they have here.  I could shop here all day.  Clothes wise - only small, medium and large.  So really cute but really small.  Most of America will have to find their cute clothes somewhere else.

Quality!!!  Ingenious!!!  Awesomeness!!!!  This place needs to get closer to civilization.  Not that there isn't any in Queen Creek, but come on, they have more cows than stop lights.  Despite it being waaaayyyyyy out of the way, for me at least, it is worth it.  100\% of the time it is worth the drive.  They make their own mozzarella, fresh every day.  So of course I have to have the Caprese salad.    I really like their Ruben where the sauerkrat is home made.  My brother cannot get enough of their meatball sandwich full of tangy red sauce and cheese.  If you like ice cream they actually make their own here.  Different flavors that you cannot find anywhere else.

Amazing filet mignon. Amazing.  Nice atmosphere until they turned the lights down at which i asked for a lantern but was denied.  Wonderful service, absolutely wonderful.  Shrimp cocktail is generous and yummy.  Again, good sea food in the middle of the desert, I'm still scratching my head, but try it none the less.  Did i mention the filet mignon?  Do it.

I will take Baja Fresh over that other place any time.  Any time.  This particular place is clean and friendly.  I personally stick with the orignal Baja fish tacos.  There is something about their special tangy sauce that I really really like.  I also get the express guacamole and chips - made fresh with no wierd additives.  The chips are fresh made, I can tell, and I'm so glad they do this.  Comfortable seating; an ideal place to have a quick meal.

This is one of my favorite department stores.  I have my sercret spot to park that gets me pretty close to a door that allows me access to the womens departmet which flows into the purses/bags (good selection) then to shoes (small selection, needs improvement), right into beauty and fragrances (which houses Lancome, my brand, but has dropped escada and that bums me out).  Good quality merchandise and customer service.  Remember yelpers, you get what you pay for, so this may be a bit higher than walmart, but it's quality all the way around.

Its so wonderful to have a great place like this in Ahwatukee.  Pancakes are the best.  I said BEST!.  I really love the croque monsieur, but change it up to a madam by putting a fried egg on top.  Ask for extra bechamel sauce, they can be a little stingy with the good stuff sometimes.  They serve Cartel coffee here which as any good Pheonician knows is the best in the valley if not the country.  Fresh orange juice is great.  I did stop by once for a burger - which was good with only one caveat - juicy burger on soft bread with no layer of mayo (as Alton Brown suggests) to keep the bun from becoming a squishy mess.  Good fries, fresh cut and fried.

Good food and comfortable atmosphere.  That's for those that just need to scan real fast for the best parts.  Fondue with pretzel bread dippers were awesome.  I had the warm Italian grinder.  I really like the meats, peppers, cheese and bread but prefer my hot/warm sandwiches do not have any lettuce or tomatoes on it.  It was not mentioned on the menu so I'm warning you now.  I liked the fries, skinny and crispy.  I also tried a bite of the shaved prime rib dip and really liked it.  Other items I had a bite of: the MAC burger had quality meat but was over cooked.  We sat outside, it was the first week of November, gotta love this desert for this reason alone.  We were very comfortable and served very well by a handsome gentleman but for the life of me I cannot remember his name.  He had tattooed arms.  Oh wait, so did other servers.  They all seemed nice.  I will be back Dropout.

I obviously love myself a sandwich, there is no denying that.  This is probably the place i frequent the most often.  You really cant beat fresh cut meats.  I get it Mikes way less the onions (they seem to over power most sandwiches) - lettuce, tomatoes, oil, vinegar, spices then add yellow peppers.  Yum.  Great, now I'm hungry.  Bread is a bit crunchy, I usually like a softer bread but I think the oil and vinegar need a bread that can stand up to it.  No biggie.  A bit pricey, but worth it.

Ladies, all the ladies, go to this auto repair shop.  I went to this place for  an oil change and then mentioned something else that was going on with my 9 year old car.  My oil change was completed quick and efficiently and he completed a full inspection.  Guess what, they did not try to up sell me on anything that I did not need at this time.  I mentioned a couple of things that were told to me from another place and he even said my car doesn't need it right now unless I want to spend the money.  AMAZING!  I will forever be a customer of this place.

Preformed beef patties probably purchased from Costco does not bode well with me.    When your menu only has about 15 different things to offer one would expect that you are an expert in these items.  You would be wrong in this situation.  4 starters, 3 salads, 5 sandwiches and a few sides is not a lot to choose from.  Maybe if I mention the kids items I could "up" the number of menu items.  But I will not.  We opt for water with lemon in every restaurant we dine.  Here we got the saddest little slivers of old lemon I have ever seen.  I guess lemons are a premium citrus and cannot be spared.  The gentleman that took our order, 10 minutes before his tee time, suggested my mom try the Fajita salad as "it is the best salad on the menu".  My poor mom ended up with a cup of lettuce, a teaspoon of pre-shredded cheddar cheese, a tablespoon of sour cream, a tablespoon of pico de gallo, 4 black olives and a fried . . . . . something or other (couldn't place it and didn't attempt to taste).  She asked for extra pico as it required flavor in a bad way and was presented with just one more tablespoon in a small ramekin.  I had the burger.  I asked for it medium and got well done.  I didn't ask for it to be redone because looking at the preformed patty i  knew there were only two choices with these; frozen or done.  The bun was good and would have been perfect with a fresh hand formed beef patty.  I had to pay extra for the fries, they were okay.  I'd like to say that there would be no reason for me to return, but I left my check card there and had to go back to retrieve it.  Unfortunate for The Boatzhouse that will be the last time I return, unless I forgot anything else.  Wait, where are my car keys . . . . . .

Sorry to say that since I was last there the gravy fries have changed, in name and in quality.  They no longer use a good quality aged cheddar cheese and now they put "curds" on them.  Yuck.  The pastrami on the Rueben was so salty I could not eat the sandwich.  I might try it again to find some value in this place, I really do want to like it.

This is the only place that I get my car washed.  It's a fair deal and if you go in on a weekday it doesn't hurt to ask for a discount for the second level car wash.  Thats the car wash I always get as I like my tires to be "dressed".  They give me a punch card so I can collect towards a free wash and that makes me happy.  I have gotten a full detail here and will continue to do so every year as I believe my car is worth it.

Quantity and quality.  I enjoy the pastrami and corned beef.  I tried their hotdog and found it very tasty.  The potatoe cakes are awesom although I dont eat them with the applesause because I just don't get that.  The fries are decent but I avoid the cole slaw and potatoe salad as I'm not a fan of the flavor profile.  The portions are very big.  My mom ordered a small chef salad and found that to be very large.  The Jewish sliders are wonderful.  They have a wonder bakery with cakes, slices of cake, cupcakes and an wonderful assortment of cookies.    Of course they bagels, every flavor and all the fixings to go along with them.  They also sell their breads packaged for take home.

Great bread and super fast.  Sometimes I like mustard on my sandies, they only have dijon.  But I obviously deal.  Italian Night Club is my favorite.  Its what keeps me coming back and back and back.    Did I mention the bread?

Great atmosphere - dark wood and white linens.  Filet mgnonn was tender as any good steak house should be.  They do grill their steaks here, something I think is important to know as usually I like mine done seared then finished in an oven.  None the less it was good.  Took my pop here and he like himself a sauce such as a bearnaise, but they did not offer this.  Even a peppercorn sauce would have been nice - but like I mentioned before, they grill here and I find grillers like the taste of the meat and don't count on sauces.  Sorry pop, deal.  Entrees come with baked potatoes, fries or sweet potato fries.  Of course I had the baked which was perfect.  Mandy at the bar served us and she was fantastic - very knowledgeable, upbeat and accommodating.  We will be back.

I know its a burger place but try the hotdogs.  All items are grilled.    Buns are fresh.  Tons of items to add to your burger/hotdog that are free.  FREE.  No charge.  Fries are awesome.  A sign tells you where the potatoes are from that day.  And they are not cheap with them.  One small is enough for two, sometimes three.  Fast and friendly service.  Somewhat loud, rock music playing, which makes the burger joint experience complete.

Great place for froyo.  We have about 4 within a few miles of us and this place is top of the list.    Great flavor options.  Fantastic toppings offering.  Priced same as most froyo places.  Friendly atmosphere.  When you give your phone number they keep track of your purchases and you get 10% of what your purchased that day off of the next time you go in!!!  They are paying you to come in again.  I love that.

Before the big opening I had the best sandwich here.  Its called the Godmother - finally, someone who got an Italian sandwich right.  Lots of saucey goodness.  This garlic pesto stuff they use is out of this world.  The meat is quality.    Second time I went here the sandwich was missing some of its saycey goodness, but the quality of the meats and bread were still there.  They are new, so I'm hoping they will be more consistent.  But I will be keeping an eye out for more saucey goodness.  Clean atmosphere.  Not a chain so they get extra points for that.   Oh and you get a free cookie.  :) who doesn't love a free cookie?  If that's you, find me, I'll take it.

A great option for something different.    Found this place when attending a Yelp event, liked it so much I came back.  Great service.  Nice atmoshpere.  Great Alcohol options.  I thought the lamb meatballs were so good that I ordered the lamb burger but was sadly disappointed.  Tzatziki is very good.  Dessert options are wonderfu so be sure to save room.

I like this place.   It's local to me, small and intimate, friendly technicians, and big comfy chairs.  This place is very reasonable.  I get pedicures, the basic ones and when I'm asked if I want the salt or sugar scrub, additional charge, I'm not forced into it like other places.  I have tried the sugar/salt scrub and do like but don't always need.

Friendly service.  Good atmosphere.  I usually sit in the bar with several TV's with some form of sports playing, God forbid I have to keep up in a conversation.  Greek salad is my favorite.  The meatball trio from the appetizer section is great.  The cheese they use on top is quality.  I'm pretty sure I could eat a bowl of melted cheese with some sauce alone.  The sauce on the pizza was a bit on the sweet side but doable.  The sandwich was good.  The calzone was good enough to be revisited.    Their hot Italian sausage is awesome.  Pasta with vodka sauce was very good.

I really like this place.  Order your food then sit and they will bring to you.  Burgers are great. Had a taste of my bro's 1/2 pound bacon cheeseburger and the meat was so tasty.  I opted to try a more healthy choice, the ground chicken was easily subbed in the green chile burger.   Choices, did I mention that you get choices? Yeah, ya do. Bun choice: white, wheat, brioche, gluten free and lettuce wrap. Can you dig it? I did;I love options.   This time I did white as I already subbed chicken for beef, next time, beef on wheat. One healthy choice at a time.  Oh yeah, no coke or pepsi here, its natural soda with real sugar!!!!!! Does anyone remember real sugar? Its awesome!!!!!   Gotta mention the side salad, fresh greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, onion and slivers of carrots. I chose the lemon and olive oil dressing, so yummy!  I'm coming back here. Who wants to meet me?

Cupcakes are the new black.   And I've had myself some cupcakes from around this valley. But nothing tops Sweet Daddy. Priced fantastic. A good amount of both cake and frosting - although I must admit that sometimes a little more frosting is what I like. The cake is moist and the frosting is fresh. I have tried and enjoy: Pumpkin Spice (limited to holiday, boo), carrot cake with cream cheese frosting, lemon with vanilla topping, bananas foster of course the red velvet. When I bring these into the office for a special occasion I am the hero.  I should make a cape.

Ahwatukee has seen a lot of burger shops pop up lately and this one is a good one.  Originally from Santa Barabar, Ca these people have figured out how to make a good burger.  Toasted bun, less than 1/4 patty (so if you are a big eater, get the double), lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions, pickles and mayo.  This is a pretty good combo as it comes but I added mustard (I like it spicy) and cheese (extra fat = extra taste).  I'm not a huge eater and this one patty was more than enough, especially since I ordered fries.   Fries are good - good size in fry length and quantity.  They do offer sweet potato fries but I have not tried them yet.  They offer a chicken, fish and meatless option as well.  If they had a drive-thru I would probably be here more often!! (hint)

I love Safeway.  Sure it may be a little pricier than the competition but it makes up for it with wide isles, great parking, friendly service and a wonderful selection.  Plus, because its a California based store, they have It's It's, located in the frozen food section - Oatmeal cookies with a quality vanilla ice-cream in the center all dipped in chocolate - soooo gooood.

Quite the corner bistro.  Fresh ingredients always make for a good food, which Timo offers.  Had the flatbread pizzas from the wood fire oven.  Enjoyed the margherita and the home-made sausage varieties.  Dark and romantic atmosphere, good place to take a date as there is ambient music without being in-your-face about it.  Servers are very friendly and are eager to make suggestions for both food and wine.

Stubborn knots? Achy shoulders? Throbbing sciatica? Yeah, I experience this most of the time. Its our American lifestyle. But when I get on Audrys table I know I'm going to feel so much better. Its knot, jk, not just a relaxing hour, its a healing experience. Her hands seek out my annoying issues and work them out.

All I've heard from Albuquerque friends was how great this place is.  They all couldn't wait for this place to open.  So far my favorite is the turkey and I'm not a bird fan at all.  For the most part I go out of my way to eat any chicken or turkey outside of home because I'm always disappointed with how dry it is.  This is NOT dry and very flavorful.  I've tried the pork ribs and the baby back ribs and like both.  I didn't even need to add sauce for the flavor they are rubbed with is plenty.  They have cream corn here and although in reality I know this is really only gravy with some corn I'm in love.  This version is very very very good.  I am not, however, impressed with the brisket.  Although flavorful it is very dry.  Not worth it to me.

Good selection of cosmetics, fragrancies, shampoo and all things hair plus a salon (not to be confused with a saloon).  I love any place that has a tester for everything.  How do  you know unless you test?  I normally buy my foundation from a line they do not sell here but costs a lot of money.  Sometimes though, after watching Suzy Orman, I feel guilty for how much I spend on said foundation and decide "I can live with the inexpensive brand, they say it's all the same" (we'll discuss that topic later).  So I go to Ulta to try the normal drugstore brand, unlike going to a drugstore and hoping I buy the right color, I can actually get what will be best for me.    Bonus to all of this?  Points.  I collect points for all I buy and get free stuff.  And I like free stuff, you should too.  Bonus bonus: look for the coupon.  Really, you should'nt be shopping without them, but Ulta has one a week, thus making it easy to show up at least once a week, right?
