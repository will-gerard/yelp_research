This was some of the worst pizza I've ever had. We stopped in for a late night snack on the way back to the hotel. I got a personal pizza, and my friend got an Italian hoagie.   One slice of this pizza, and I immediately felt sick. This doesn't generally happen to me. I finished the slice and that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. She thought her hoagie was okay, but the pizza...oh, the horror of the pizza.   Avoid.

Drive into a residential neighborhood just outside of downtown Phoenix and voila - oasis.   I loved staying here. It's been a couple years, but if the same guy is in charge, you're guaranteed to be taken care of. I can't remember his name. I want to say it was Roger? (EDIT: He is. His name is Jeff. Roger? No idea where I got that from.) He was awesome - called before I got there to check on my food preferences, and made sure I knew where he was going at night when I got there in case I needed anything. Don't get that at a Marriott.   I stayed in the Pasadena Suite, which is HUGE and very comfortable. The bedroom and bed itself were fine. There was a desk in the living room for working/laptop hookup,. and I LOVED the dinette area and patio. The breakfast was delivered in a picnic basket every morning outside your door at whatever time you specified. This was a nice touch compared to other places where you have to go to a sit-down  breakfast. Sometimes you're just not feeling so social, you know? Or maybe that's just me...Plus, as I was in town for a conference, I could eat as much of the (huge) breakfast as I could or wanted to and tuck the remaining fruit or yogurt into my bag to have for a snack later. Seriously, a nice breakfast.   I loved the whirlpool tub. The pool wasn't working when I was there but I didn't have time to hang out anyway, unfortunately. The grounds are very pretty. You have no idea you're a couple blocks away from Phoenix's main road.   It's a cab or bus ride away from downtown if you don't have a rental care, which I didn't, but that didn't bother me. it was less expensive to stay here than at the downtown hotels I checked, and I got much more for me (employer's) money than at one of them, so it was worth it. I'd go back just to visit.

First trip to Pittsburgh last weekend, and first trip to Primanti Brothers.   This place is a legend so it's worth the trip just for that. The sandwiches aren't bad either. Huge! I had the capicolla with cheese, and the requisite fries and cole slaw on the sandwich. The fries were pretty soggy and I ended up taking most of them off just so I could manage to eat the sandwich without it falling apart. Our friend the PA hometown boy had fun showing us the ropes. You stand in line at a chaotic counter, pick your sandwich, and you're on your way pretty quickly if you're carrying out (which we were.) There's table seating too but the servers were dealing with a post-last-call crowd and we didn't feel like waiting.   We ended up in the place after a night out and it's fun to see so many people hanging out and eating freakishly large sandwiches at 3 a.m. I'd do it again in a minute. I don't know if I'd be convinced to try the egg on it, but I'd go for a corned beef...Capicolla was yummy, though, and so was the bread.

I stopped in Phoenix towards the end of a solo road trip to California, which beat up my body more than a little, as it turned out. After an hour at the Art of Touch, I was all better, mind and body.   Christine is a massage pro and a lovely human being, careful to evaluate what's specifically going on with you, and works to your needs. She's intuitive and makes it her job, obviously, to make this a good experience for you.    The space is calm and beautiful, too. A massage from her made the last leg of my trip entirely bearable (physically, anyway.) If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a regular customer. If you do, you're lucky you can be.
