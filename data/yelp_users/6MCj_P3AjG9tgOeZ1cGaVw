Good food but a terrible experience. They won't seat you unless your entire party is there.  Cash only or local check. The rush you out so they can turn the tables as fast as possible. And in general the atmosphere is anything but relaxing. You feel like you don't even have time to enjoy your food.

Our son has ADHD and Dyslexia. His inability to focus and perform simple tasks is pretty difficult. We've been taking him to Dr Silverman for a little more than a month now. His speech has improved and he is finally getting a great night's sleep which, is really helping throughout the day. We are seeing the beginning signs of better concentration and focus. Dr, Silverman's expertise and personalized treatment has been fantastic. After reviewing several "Neurofeedback" places, the big difference we have seen is that having a qualified expert working directly with our son makes a world of difference. We would highly recommend using Dr Silverman over the "non-experts".

The place is terrible. I don't understand why it is so crowded. The pancakes tasted like they came out of a box. My son's tatter tots were reheated frozen ones you can buy in a store. The granola tasted and looked like it came from Safeway next door. Save your money. You can make a better breakfast at home.

This was the worst dining experience I have ever had in Phoenix. First, don't come here. Secondly, if you do, don't order the ribs.  After a 45 minute wait, they came out lukewarm and tough.  And seriously, we waited 45 minutes for my kids to get chicken strips and French fries and my wife to get a side dish and a side salad. The manager was so uncaring about it. While he said he was sorry and gave us 20% off our check, he came across as cold. He even tried to argue with us that it had only been 15 minutes. He never even came back to the table to check in with us after that. I had a meal be about 10 minutes late at Flower Child once and not only was the server sincerely apologetic but she comped our whole meal and gave us a $25 gift card to come back. That is customer service.  @Kitchen 56, you have a lot to learn about cooking food and customer service.

A small place but super cool. The Espresso Spritzer is awesome even if you don't like coffee.

I have used Dave for more than 12 years now and even after all that time he makes each transaction feel as important as the first. He makes the process of buying and selling so easy and painless that I can't possibly recommend him enough. Thanks Dave!
