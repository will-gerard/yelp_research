Huge portions! A little over whelming, I always have left overs. Their waffles, corn bread, chicken, chili cheese fries, and Mac-n-cheese are very delicious! Oh the biscuits and gravy.... Make my mouth water specially the chicken breast smothered in gravy.   Service is good for always being packed when I go.  Drinks are served in Mason jars. One to two jars and your full! They will give you to go cups if you'll like. Their sweet tea and kool aid are very very sweet, some people dilute it with water.  This is the only place I'll drink sweet drinks because it's worth it, I tend to always have water or beer.   I recommend people to come at least once, there is lots to choose from!

True best tacos al Pastor! They use the "trompo" method on Tuesdays and weekends. Carne Asada tacos are delicious! $1 taco Tuesday's! I have gotten a small order of beans every time and every time it tastes like my mom's homemade beans, I dare you to try them. They also have a Quick service! Only drawback is have cash, otherwise ATM fee of $2. Don't let the location scary you, the tacos are worth the drive!

Cheap drinks! One drink, Max 2 drinks and you are done for the night! They sell huge mason jars called "groupies" for big groups and again super cheap!   Great music!  I am curious on the food, but never make it early enough to try it and also feel weird being the only one eating @10, when everyone else is partying it up. LOL

I have taken my Corvette to get the A/C fixed and also taken my Nissan to get the tires fixed and I am yet to be disappointed.  Great service, friendly staff and they do the work in a timely manner.  Also last time I went to pick up my Nissan, I discovered that they can pick you up and drop you off if you live near the area, which I do.  Its a good shop and don't forget the coupons you get in the mail, I have saved a lot of money!

Service sucks! Poor waitress they couldn't keep the tables cleaned! Meanwhile both hostess in the front of the restaurant, as my mom would say. "Se están haciendo mensas." I recommend sitting at the bar if you are going to go, the environment was chill, drinks are well priced. I'm willing to come back and try their food.

Okay! I gave it a second chance. After 10 minutes of sitting down, no one came. I saw the bartender see me and nothing. A man passed by me and ignored me. Even the hostess saw us come in. If you come expect sh*** service or NONE at all!    The place was empty to begin with, that's why I went.

Anytime I want a burger I think... ISLANDS after you have had a burger from here, you will never want to go to another place.  I love their Rincon burger and their bottomless french fries! Their burgers are so juicy that wow it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  I first came here about a year ago and i was hooked! I come here about once a week.  I love this place, love the food, their brown ale (beer), the service is great, friendly people, relaxing atmosphere... What else could you ask for?

It is the best SUSHI in the WestValley.  Happy hour rolls are delicious and cheap.  My favorite sushi roll is the Hot Night Roll and I can only find it in this restaurant.  I totally recommend it! It is a very simple, hidden away place with GREAT service.  I come here anytime I want sushi!

Their 2 for $25 deal is amazing! It happens a few times a year. Ask for Amber, she is real cool.   I love their BJ's Favorite Pizza with jalapeños instead of olives. I also love their Cesar salad. Their Hickory burger is delicious! Their Jeramiah Red beer is to die for! That's what keeps me coming back!

Very delicious food!   Their stuffed won-tons where too thin for my taste, I like them a little thicker, but I still loved them.  The ambiance was very quiet and peaceful, just what I need after a long day at work.  Service was great until more people started shopping up and then the service was not so great.  I recommend this place for a peaceful hangout and Asian food dinner :)

Last Fall I came here to get my hair done and so far I think it is the Best hair place that I like!  I walked in without an appointment and everyone was very friendly.  I got my hair dyed and cut for about $100. I even got a glass of wine with it!    Since then, I have returned once and done the same thing.  The staff is very welcoming, I even witnessed them cutting a little girl's hair and being professional towards her and being kid friendly.  I feel relaxed when I'm there.    I think you would enjoy the free glass of wine too ;)  If you are a guy, you might enjoy the sexy hairstylist.

Delicious, is the only word I can use to describe the fantastic Scorpion bowl, an alcoholic drink for two. My house salad was delicious along with my spicy Thai chicken bowl. My love, had the chicken sandwich, which he loved. Our waitress Bailey, was super friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be returning specially to try their Hawaiian chicken and also their Volcano Bowl (alcoholic bowl) meant for 3-4 people.

New owners so no Yelp 25% of food discount as of 7-07-16 :(   I just spent 2 hours listening to "Musica Cubana." Me encanto! Habana Nights on Thursdays! You should have felt the atmosphere, the regulars were celebrating a birthday and the party just kept arriving throughout the evening. Everyone was super friendly!   Food is from next door "Ziggy's Italian Pizza." We had the pizza and the arugula-apple salad which was delicious!   I had a Caparina drink which was like a mojito but no mint.   I wish this place was closer to me. It was full of Latin flavor! There were people from pretty much every part of South America: Cuba, Venezuela, Panamá, Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, Puerto Rico, and Mexicans, African Americans, Polish people, White people and more.   Service was great, but then it got super busy and it became a little slow due to only one or two waiters.

We came here during my Winter Break and this place looks creepy from the outside, but once you are inside it's like "WOW"  they have so many types of soda like 300's from all over the world.  That was my boyfriends favorite part, who knows how many he drank. LOL.  We ordered burgers and we were very satisfied, can't wait to go again!

My new sushi place! I come here at least twice a month, they have happy hour 4-10 every time I come here and I come here any day of the week! I have ordered the Dynamite, Scorpion, Philadelphia, Pink lady?, spicy tuna, California, and others.  I have yet to be disappointed.  Their sake bombers are super cheap!  The staff is very friendly as well.

Fast and delicious! Always in and out within 40 minutes. I love their ceviche tostadas. Their carne Asada tacos are also delicious. They have crispy flautas that come in a plate with beans and rice. Their burritos chimichangas are huge. Their enchiladas are good too. I recommend this place. With $20 two people can eat comfortably!

Tons of beer on draft, very chill place.  Live music and just caught a glimpse of celebrity, Gabriel Iglesias, who happened to walk over from the Stand Up Comedy place next door.  I'll definitely back!... I gave it a 4 because I was freezing.

For a Mexican place, the salsa with chips was disappointing!  I walked in and I was excited to try a new place, but once it took forever to get my Margarita which tasted like cheap tequila and to add to the bad salsa I knew I was done.  I was starving and with no waiter around I couldn't even place my food order.  I paid for my margarita and went somewhere else to eat.

Margaritas with a beer $8.50!  I got the Red,White and Blue Margarita and it comes with my favorite blueberry beer which happens to be a 8% alcohol content. Beer on draft of Monday's is only $3! You can't beat that!   Tacos are delicious! Their combo meal of two tacos with 2 sides is a sweet deal!   Their brisket burrito is bomb! They are not stingy with their   Their shredded chicken salad with their house vinaigrette is good too!  I recommend this place!

Parking sucks, but you'll get over it due to their delicious burgers and beer! I would come weekly but live too far away. I come for the Sweet Chili burger or the spiciest burger ever... AZ burger! Truly delicious.

Great beer! Like 30 beers on tap and they have wine too.  Great atmosphere, waiters are friendly and great music. It's a nice place to chill and try out different beers.   I tend to have their seasonal food items when I go. Food is AMAZING! I have not been disappointed so far.   Their salad was tasty. The pretzel bites are fluffy and baked to perfection!   Their burrito comes with chicharones on the side. Yum!    Their pizza was delicious, thin crust and full of flavor.  I've also had their burgers with fries. Oh and I've had their tacos as well!

AMAZING Music!!  Looking for Rock en Espanol? Cumbia? This place will be a great night club.   Food is delicious! You can't go wrong with any of their meat choices! With $20 two people can eat and still have left overs for another meal!   They are working on getting their liquor license. Once they have it, it'll be worth the drive.  P.S. They use to be "Santos Lucha Libre"

Tostadas de ceviche where delicious, but a little high priced @7. My boyfriend got a tostada of aguachile and for $9 it wasn't spicy at all, he even had to add hot sauce. I would recommend the ceviche but not aguachile. I would also recommend going midday since other reviews complain about loud music and I went around 2:00p.m. And the  music was fine, it was actually pretty empty, so service was good. Not sure if I will be returning to try their shrimp cocktail or just wait to go to CA?

Delicious 3B burger! I was not a fan of the salsa and chips, they were missing flavor, no salt, no chile, no seasoning. The chili cheese fries we had substituted for regular fries, were definitely different, you could tell it was quality meat! My love and I split the burger and a beer and it ended up being $29, not including tip, but I do recommend going to try something new! One day I will try something more rare. ;)

Really enjoyed it, I'm glad it's on the west side! I had their red ale and it was smooth and strong... Just perfect! Definitely coming back. My boyfriend loved the decor and the music. I enjoyed their chili cheese fries, definitely the best I've ever had!

So I have gone a few more times and they don't have the beer I like anymore. Now what has turned me off officially from going is that they will not be carrying their delicious chili cheese fries any longer. They are changing their menu. So, I am uncertain if you should even bother.

I love their fish tacos! They have $3 margaritas and they have ping pong, which is fun! Their tacos I think are a little over priced, but really good!

Best Chili Cheese Fries ever!!!  Come to Avondale!  To the owner... Just like you asked here are my main cross streets: Avondale Blvd. and Thomas.   Review: (4.5) batmosphere was great! Right as you walked in very friendly. The owner even gave my boyfriend a free conie as a sample!  The conie was definitely delicious and my boyfriend and I are not hot dog lovers, but it has no pork so we tried it.  We got there towards closing time and they said we could stay and eat. I was already thinking about eating outside so we wouldn't bother them. Lol very kind people.   So, My "Hani" pita was delicious, the chicken was crispy, cheese and just flavorful! My boyfriend had the D burger and he said it was delicious! We had the chili cheese fries and I must say, better than Portillos or Lenny's (or it is Leanie's?).  Only reason I did not give a 5 is because I had the Greek salad and it wasn't as delicious as I thought. The Greek salad at Pita Kitchen is better.  Oh and we had. Faygo pop, the black cherry flavor, it was tasty!   I totally recommend this place!!!

Great customer service! Immediate greet at the door and even when you leave! Chili cheese fries are amazing! The cheeseburger was good, but the Beef and Italian sausage was DELICIOUS! I will drive just for chili cheese fries.  =)

Truly best burger ever, I'm sure I've said it before, but this time I mean it! I got the 1/3 pound beef on multi grain bun. I put some basic ingredients but my favorite was the hickory barbecue sauce and my second favorite was the sweet saricha. I always save half of my burger for later. This time I couldn't even save it! Forget the beer or shakes or fries the burger was BOMB! My fiancé loved his chipotle sauce with his burger along with his chili cheese fries.   Get the the deal from Groupon it saves you some money. We will definitely be returning!   P.S. Ask for Ross, he was real cool and gave us all of the tips for being first timers!
