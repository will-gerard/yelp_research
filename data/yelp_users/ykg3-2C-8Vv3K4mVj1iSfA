The furniture and art in Red is amazing, but damn, if I could only afford some of it.  Although I know the owners/sellers/docents can see it in my dead eyes that I am only the transient type who enjoys looking at beautiful things that my graduate degrees' debts will prevent me from purchasing, they have always been friendly and helpful to me when I have browsed around this temple to vintage teak and sleek plastic.  Okay, so my only hang-up with Red is that a lot of neat stuff does not have price tags; who knows, maybe I could afford some stuff if I knew what the price was...still, probably not...yet.

Village Lanes is a great bowling experience.  This bowling center is clean, the staff is helpful, friendly, and attentive.  Recently renovated, the cleanliness of Village Lanes cannot be understated, because I am sure most people have had the dirty bowling center experience, and it can turn a fun family night into a seedy experience.  Village Lanes has a nice snack center and bar-lounge area; it could be great for birthday parties.  Cheers!

Bring out ye dead, bring out ye dead!  Many years ago, in my youth, I lived right across the street from Greenwood Memory.  Every Halloween in elementary school, during those same years of my childhood, my music teacher would show us an old film reel of a cartoon skeletons dancing around a cemetery set to Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns' "Danse Macabre;" I loved this, and I always thought that Greenwood Memory Lawn would be the perfect setting for such a ghastly event.  In all seriousness, I have friends and family members buried here, and when I did live across the street from it, I enjoyed strolling through the grounds.  If you don't have an issue with the thousands of corpses beneath your feet, this is actually an incredibly beautiful park with old growth trees set right in the middle of urban/industrial Phoenix

The Hidden House is a great little bar that has become the keystone of the local comedy scene.  Every Wednesday night there is a free admission open mic for local comics to try out their material.  It is usually a mix of comics who have either been performing for years or are brand new to the comedy scene; this can make for a night of many laughs or just a night of uncomfortable awkward silence, but hey, it is free.  The food and drink are cheap, and the staff is always friendly.

The worst coffee in the City of Tempe.  The full name of this place is "Cupz: The Coffee Experience;" are they kidding?  Whatever the heck that is supposed to mean, and whatever the coffee experience is supposed to be, this place is not it.  The coffee is watered down and the "z" in the name does not make this place urban or hip, it just makes it a lame attempt to be in tune with a younger generation.

This is more a remedial course in Sushi, rather than Sushi 101.  After visiting Sushi 101 three or four times, I have decided to never return.  It is not that this is a terrible restaurant, it is not, but considering the large number of other sushi restaurants in the area, there is no reason to go back.  Basic problems: 1) Service: It has always been slow and disorganized (i.e. getting seated and not being approached by a server for 15 minutes, always shorthanded) 2) Uninspired food: bland and not especially fresh in taste (their wasabi has little-to-no-kick)  3) Ambience and Smell:  I know that this might seem petty, but there is nothing worse than eating in a place that specializes in preparing fish, and all you can smell is old fish.

This place could be great, and I've always wanted to like it more than I actually do.  Occasionally, I have stopped into Mill's End for breakfast, specifically because they have crepes on their menu; in fact, their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe.  For reasons explained below, lately I've found myself just walking past Mill's End, no longer considering giving it my business.  The general issues that I have with this place involve just a couple of basic things; if the owners made the effort to correct these, I believe Mill's End could be a great cafe.  I have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors.  It is with all three of these that Mill's End falls short:   1)Ambience.  This means that the environment must be suitable both for studying/reading, as well as relaxation.  So, the music playing needs to be something that is non-intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore; sometimes Mill's End has this covered, but other times not at all.  Onto the seating.  It seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995, in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the TV show "Friends;" unfortunately, they didn't come close, but there is usually plenty of seating open.  By the way, what is up with pseudo-sexual ice photography on the walls?  2)Price.  This is actually my number one problem with Mill's End.  The coffee is reasonably priced, but the food is too expensive.  Anytime I tell someone that I ate there, it's always the same response, "yeah, their food is good, but it's really pricey."  Considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop, I imagine that their business has gone up, but those prices sure haven't dropped.  3.Customer service.  The staff has always been just lukewarm.  Look, I don't expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time, I only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality; this has just always been kind of lacking at Mill's End.  Honestly, I think this place has a lot of potential, but it seems to be awash in complacency.

The Coffee Plantation prides itself on the selling point that its "Arizona Owned and Operated," but unfortunately it is one of the few good things about this place.  A little less than a decade ago this was one of the coolest coffee shops in the valley, but it seems that little has been done to maintain its former luster, and now it is simply coasting on the fact that it has a prime location.  Back then live music was practically a given any night of the week at the Plantation, but now the customer is only treated to a poorly chosen Muzak station with the volume cranked way too high (my idea for good coffee shop music is anything that can generally be ignored, so many great coffee houses unfortunately feel the need to blast Nickleback into your ears). The location is the only other thing going for this place, it is a great location for people watching on Mill, and has a counter with stools facing the sidewalk and street.  Onto the coffee and food.  Does anyone remember when the Coffee Plantation had a full menu of awesome sandwiches, what happened?  Now there's just a half-empty glass case of pastries.  The coffee is sub par, not terrible, but not great, and it's not unusual to get a lukewarm cup rather than hot; also, why do they always have to go behind closed doors to get my coffee, it kind of creeps me out that it is not right out in the open.  (I should point out that when talking about the coffee, I only drink regular coffee and I don't go for the elaborate coffee concoctions.)  The staff is hit and miss, sometimes friendly sometimes not.  Basically, this place has been running on auto-pilot for too many years and could use some new ideas and new energy.  Everything in this review pretty much applies to the Plantation at the Biltmore Fashion Mall as well.

Rula Bula saved my marriage!  Rula Bula also holds the secrets of the Free Masons, is a regular meeting place for the Illuminati, and the Knights Templar once excavated its basement with the goal of finding the Holy Grail.  Okay, now that I have your attention, I can honestly say that only one of those things are true.    The fact of the matter is that I have put off writing a review of Rula Bula for over a year because I have always found it difficult to articulate why I love this place so much.  Anyway, I could put it off no longer, so here it goes:  Many years ago, when I came of drinking age, Rula was one of the first pubs I went to and it has always held a special place in my heart.  Now, do not get me wrong, the reasons that I hold RB in such high regard are not all based upon sentimental nostalgia.  Let us start with the menu.  I am a vegetarian and Rula has always been a safe refuge for me; the vegetarian shepherds pie is phenomenal and their veggie burger is always a safe bet.  Rula also has my favorite dessert in the Valley of the Sun; the Irish Bread Pudding with Vanilla Ice Cream is responsible for an extra five pounds I carry around these days.  Moving on, the ambience of this Irish pub located in the desert is relaxation incarnate.  Okay, let the debate end right here, right now--although Rula Bula's bar and woodwork were constructed in Ireland and shipped to Tempe, this does not make it an authentic Irish pub, and someone arguing either side of that coin is a moron.  Nowhere in the bar, on their menu, or on their website do the owners claim that Rula is an "authentic" Irish pub.  RB is 7500 miles from Ireland, so no, it is not going to be exactly like the homeland.  Also, I do not seem to read a lot of reviews of people complaining that Pizzeria Bianco's food and ambience is not authentic, the way it is in Naples; get over it, people.  Beer!  I love that I can get all of my favorite Irish and English beers on tap here.  Live music!  I love their open mic night and basically all the other nights during the week when they have great bands playing.  One last point, they have a great staff of bartenders and servers.  Enjoy!

Simply delicious!  Very friendly people making and serving great dishes.  Many larger restaurants with so-called vegetarian/vegan menu sections could learn a lot from this place.

First of all, the hours, this place keeps the most absurd hours for a restaurant serving 50,000+ students and faculty.  I cannot tell you how many times I've walked over to get a sandwich and Sacks has been closed.  They open sometime in the morning and close at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon, I can't report definitively what the hours are because they do not list them on Sacks' website, apparently they are trying to keep it a secret.  I understand a sandwich shop in downtown Phoenix keeping these hours, but here is an update for the owners of Sacks: ASU students and faculty do not keep bank hours.  The quality of the food is substandard but the sandwiches are priced reasonably.

I have worked a block away from The Chuck Box for the last three years, but I only gave it a shot a couple of months ago, and then I kicked myself for not walking in this place years earlier.  I'm a vegetarian, and this may be the reason I would have never considered going into this place, until I discovered (via Yelp) that they have a veggie burger on their menu.  I order my veggie burger with pepper jack cheese, and two slices of grilled pineapple, and it is delicious.  By the way, hands down, The Chuck Box has the best fries in Tempe.  Now, there are a couple of reasons why I'm giving The Chuck Box four stars instead of five:  1) They only take cash, no cards, and this is a little frustrating in 2009.  There is an ATM in the place, but of course there is a fee for taking cash out, so you can add $2.50 to the cost of your lunch, which can kill the cost-effectiveness of eating at this place.  2) This place can get really busy and the ordering system is abrasive, i.e. the cook yelling at people to take their order.  Now, some people probably love this system, because it creates a unique atmosphere, but I just find it kind of nerve-racking.  A side note for vegetarians: If you have a problem with your food being cooked on grill that has had meat products cooked on it, where your veggie burger is in close proximity to meat on the grill, you will probably have a problem eating here.

Similar to another one of the reviewers, I also ate at La Perla years ago with my family, and I remembered it in a positive light.  While I have grown older, La Perla has just turned into a worn-down establishment.  The food was just okay, I had a chimichanga and my girlfriend had the chile relleno, which she pointed out, was very greasy.  The real problem I had with the restaurant had to do with its cleanliness.  While eating, I kept looking around and noticing how everything from the carpet to the walls was covered in a layer of filth.  The owners of La Perla should close it for a month so they can rip out the carpet, paint it, and replace the dirty, dirty booths.

When I moved back to Tempe to attend graduate school at ASU, after having lived out of state for a number of years, I learned of the 3 Roots Coffee Shop from a couple of colleagues. I was warned right away that the 3 Roots staff could be a bit snobby/snotty, but considering the lack of decent coffee on campus and that 3 Roots happens to only be one block from my office, I decided to give it a shot; that was two years ago. Over the last two years I've learned that those colleagues who warned me about the snobs at 3 Roots were correct, but also that the coffee is good.  Before I continue with my own personal reasons for giving this cafe a negative review, I will first cover some of the general points about it. As it has already been pointed out, the coffee at 3 Roots is a safe bet, and it's good quality. The staff, in general, is not as bad as the Soup Nazi, but it is the rule rather than the exception when a hipster barista acts as though they are too cool to be taking your coffee order and kicks a little attitude your way. The cafe has a reasonably vegetarian-friendly menu consisting mainly of sandwiches and soups, but everything on the menu is overpriced. The cafe's proximity to a campus that is laughably short on food options allows them to markup menu items to a point that a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a cup of coffee leaves you with little change after paying with a ten dollar bill. The ambiance of the cafe is nice but can get crowded quickly, making it okay to read a book and take notes, but not great for a nice quiet lunch.  Now for my own reasons. Until a couple of months ago, I also had taken on the role of telling people about the good coffee at 3 Roots and its nice bohemian atmosphere, but also hinting at the seeming disdain the staff has for its customers. But, it was a couple of months ago when I had an overpriced lunch at 3 Roots with extremely poor service that I decided I simply had had enough of the place. This incident is not what drove me to actually write this negative review for 3 Roots, while this incident was simply annoying, it was not all that out of the ordinary for the cafe and just happened to be the last straw for me. The incident that drove me to write this review was when my girlfriend, who recently moved to the area from out of state, decided to have lunch at 3 Roots last week and was treated to the insulting chauvinistic rant of a poorly educated hipster working the counter. It is my own fault for not fully warning her about about the staff at 3 Roots, but even I could have not prepared her for the inappropriate treatment she received as a customer. The manger/owner of 3 Roots needs to have a serious conversation with their employees about inappropriate boundaries being crossed with customers. At this point I will never go into 3 Roots again, nor will I recommend it to anyone; in fact, it will now be my job to warn every single person I can about the cafe. The coffee is not good enough to deal with the unprofessional and insulting persons serving it.

Excellent! I took my girlfriend to Quiessence for her birthday not completely knowing what to expect. It is a quaint old farm house tucked away on the South Mountain Farm, and it oozes charm. My girlfriend and I are both vegetarians and the menu had plenty of options for us. We started with the artisan and farmstead Cheese platter (which you choose three cheeses from a list of about twenty-five) and it comes with candied dates, pecans, and apple slices; this was simply delicious. I continued with the Arizona citrus and romaine salad, topped off with fried shallot slices, and my girlfriend went with the cannellini bean soup; both were amazing. I finished with the farmer's cheese gnocchi with cauliflower, pine nuts, and raisins, and my date had the vegetable palette, which is a selection of that days fresh vegetables. The entire meal was transcendent, and trying to articulate how right everything was and felt is difficult to do.   The wine list is extensive and the service is fantastic. Quiessence is pricey, but completely worth it. In a city that sorely lacks upscale dining experiences, Quiessence is a breath of fresh air.

Coffee shop-perfection.  Friendly staff, great coffee, free wifi, great location (ten steps from a light rail stop), wonderful ambience, and delicious food.  They got everything right with this place; I laid out my criteria for what makes a great coffee shop in my review of Mills End Cafe, and Fair Trade achieves all of those standards, and more.

I would rather have my hand slammed in a van door than have to go back to this place again.  I have lived in Tempe for years and just never made it into The Tavern on Mill, but today I made a special effort to give this place a shot, but I should have just gone to Rula Bula instead.  I ducked into the Tavern in the late afternoon, only to encounter a total lack of hospitality.  Two waitresses greeted me at separate points in the first few minutes I was there, both with questions that might as well have been, "What are you doing here?"  Both times I was slightly taken aback, and I replied sheepishly that I was there for lunch, as I felt like I had done something wrong by even walking through the door.  The waitress who was my actual server seemed to distain me for some unknown reason, and I felt that I needed to work to win her over and demonstrate to her that I was a good customer.  Then I realized that since I was the customer, wasn't she supposed to try to win me over by making me feel somewhat comfortable in this establishment.  Anyway, the bad/indifferent attitude of the wait staff conflicts with the mellow surfer decor of the bar.  I ordered a burrito, enchilada style, only to be told that they still had to make the enchilada sauce, and that I could queso sauce instead.  Not that big of deal.  Considering that I went on a Monday, which is happy hour all day, I initially was planning on having a couple of cheap beers, but when I was near the end of eating, the check was put in front of me, signaling that my meal was over.  I would only go back to this place if a friend dragged me there.

I try to stay away from writing reviews for chain restaurants, but upon seeing that Cheeburger Cheeburger had an average rating of 4 stars, I felt that it was necessary to bring to light the mediocrity of this place.  It's not that its absolutely terrible, because it's not, but everything about this particular Cheeburger location is a bit off.  The atmosphere is basically a poor attempt at 1950s kitsch-diner, which I don't really understand why they want to make this place look like a '50s diner, it just seems like an idea that was hashed out in conference room one day, and then poorly executed.  This particular location suffers from the "mall effect," that is, a lot of families with young kids screaming.    The food is okay, and the menu has some fun and interesting options for burger toppings (guacamole, onion rings, pineapple, teriyaki sauce, etc).  One thing that slightly irked me about this place was that the burgers don't come with french fries, you have to order them separately, which I think is restaurant sacrileg.  I know I'm getting knit-picky, so I'll wrap it up.  If you want a better burger-chain restaurant experience, I recommend  the Red Robin that is literally 500 yards away in Tempe Marketplace; it has better food, better service, and a much better atmosphere.

This place has a sleek look to it, but with plasma televisions all over the place the customer ends up getting stuck with their trickle-down cost on the overpriced menu.  Speaking of the menu, it is fairly generic in terms of Sonoran-Mexican cuisine. If you want a better meal, friendlier service (not being rushed through like cattle), try Restaurant Mexico one block north on Mill, it is better food at half the price.

Simply put, Cartel Coffee Lab is the vanguard of coffee shops.  This is a scaled down, bare-bones shop that has a limited drink menu, for which I am thankful.  If you are looking for a frappuccino, or some kind of blended fruit concoction, this is not the place for you; the Cartel owners are true to the coffee bean, and they are not interested in manipulating or mutilating it.  Things I love about the Cartel: The chill atmosphere, the super-friendly staff, the premium coffee (obviously), and the independent feel of the place.    Side note: This is not a coffee shop built around the whims of commuters who are in a rush to get to work.  They take great care at Cartel to make a great cup of coffee, which means that it might take a few minutes to get your order.

This place is great, and I have to second Amy S.'s point about Cookiez being one of the better establishments on Mill Avenue.  These cookie ice cream sandwiches are amazing.  I always go simple and just get vanilla ice cream on chocolate chip cookies, but all of the ice cream cookie combinations are fantastic.  The owner/manager and staff are always really friendly.
