Superior food and great customer service. A friend turned me on to this restaurant. I have been addicted to their spicy feta fries and gotta get my fix every now and then.  It's at a prime spot with lots of shopping. Big Lots, Wal Mart, Frys Marketplace and Home Depot are just a few to mention. Eat wisely here, because Ritas Frozen Custard is in the same block. That is if you don't go for Saba's flaming baklava. That is a sight to behold and never gets old. Opa!!!

Good, clean airport. Forget about driving around it. Whoever engineered the roads was one pissed off person. That engineer hates drivers, Phoenicians and people in general. Park your car elsewhere and get dropped off.

My wife and I were out celebrating our 4th anniversary together and decided to stop in at Island's as an impromptu visit. We've been to Island's many times before and this location has always been good to us. However, our server Jorge made this visit the best we've had yet. Our diets have changed significantly since we last ate at Island's so we asked for vegan specific suggestions. Jorge went above and beyond the call of duty and attended to our every need without us asking much.  Then, the manager stopped by our table and was super attentive to us as well. We shared that Jorge did an exceptional job and hope he gets rewarded accordingly. Of course, we left him a substantial tip, but I think it hardly gives Jorge the credit he deserves.   We will return to Island's and most likely insist on having Jorge for our server. 5-freakin' stars well-earned!

Booooo! It's 1:30am. It says they're open 24/7 but none of the doors are opening to let us in. Update your info Walmart! You suck. Disappointed.

A little noisy and very packed. Server was a little slow to greeting us, but after that it was great. I can do without the loud birthday songs. They're obnoxious and completely unnecessary these days. Three birthday songs in one meal really brought the experience down from perfect to near perfect. Red Robin should reconsider doing this dated old tradition. Dorky family members will be disappointed, but the rest of us will not miss this loud spectacle.  Excellent food and the fries cannot be beat!

My wife and I love this location best of all the area Sweet Tomatoes. The decor has a warmer style, the staff is exceptionally nice, and the food rarely disappoints. I'd recommend that if you plan on coming, then you should opt in to their weekly email club for coupons. We never pay full price. So, it's usually under $20 for lunch for the two of us. Great eats! And excellent place for vegetarians.

Great customer service! It didn't take long for someone to spot my wife and I blindly searching for toner cartridges for our home printer. Then, the cashier Nick was extra nice and made sure that we kept a valuable portion of our printer (the slide that holds the toner drum). Excellent place!

Chris did a wonderful job on our taxes and was extremely patient in answering all our questions. I highly recommend working with the Hacker family when it comes to all things related to taxes. Superior service and we will certainly return for our quarterly taxes.

What a wonderful place and I enjoy every visit here. I started coming to see Dr. Pissano over a year ago because of my nagging neck and low back issues. After 6 months of solid, consistent treatments my symptoms decreased and I felt much better. Love this place.

This was my first visit to this Hi Health location and I found it great. The two employees were super nice and weren't salesy. I asked them about the new preworkout and he hooked me up with a sample. Super excited to try it out. Will be back to this location again

I'm kind of baffled by the 1 star reviews on here. This location is wonderful and I've had nothing but superior customer service. Kevin, the manager, is always quick to greet my wife and I when we come in and he also has a lot of product knowledge. He's beginning to know us very well and so is the staff. It's kind of like Cheers but in a supplement store. This hi health location is probably the best in the company in my opinion. I'm sorry to hear if anybody else had a poor experience. Come back and give them a shot, they really are awesome.

They give great efficient service and the prices are reasonable. With a wide selection of supplements, this truly is a one stop shop. I highly recommend one of their freshly made protein drinks. A great place to visit before or after your workout. Or, stop here when you're on the go for a quick healthy snack.

My wife and I frequently come here for their awesome steak fries and garden burgers. Wait time is rarely long and today was no exception. We were supposed to wait 15-20 minutes, but ended up only waiting 5 minutes. Our server, Courtney, was friendly, accommodating and quick. She seemed to know that we were ready to order as soon as she approached us. So rather than waste time with drink orders alone she put in our food order too. Excellent place!

The staff at Fascinations are incredibly approachable, helpful and at times, insightful.  They have steered my wife and I in the correct direction and they have yet to let us down.  Makes going to an adult store more fun and NOT creepy (unlike other adult store chains).

Jason's Deli is an inexpensive restaurant my wife and I love to eat at for lunch or dinner. Their salad bar is perfect for us and we will surely come back again and again.  The only part I don't like about their all you can eat salad bar is that I have go to the counter to ask for a plate exchange. This requirement is so that you use a clean plate for each visit to the salad bar. I feel slightly guilty when I ask for new plate more than once.

This place is terrible on a good day.  I've worked with senior citizens for over 20 years and have been to many great and not-so-great places.  Belfiore is in the top 10 in worst establishments.  The seniors spoke so highly of the place, so I was happy to take them to lunch there on a few occasions.  Each visit became increasingly worse.    Now, for the record, Belfiore DOES have pretty good food, so if you don't care about poor customer service and just want your food, this is the place to go.  But, if you are planning on having a group larger than 4 people to meet for lunch, run away.  The server/waitress was short-tempered, rude and carried an air of superiority.  She referred to everyone as "sweetie", "darling" or "baby" which was delivered in a harsh tone (offering little as an endearing term).  Each person was served one at a time, so it left others staring at the lucky recipient wishing that they had something to eat.  The drinks were served in cheap styrofoam containers with a plastic lid and when asked to refill, she abruptly responded, "It's not FREE," snatched up said cup and stormed off.    For some reason, I foolishly agreed to 2 return trips after the first until finally I had to insist that we NEVER go again.  They all agreed and we haven't returned since.    Belfiore owners:  please work on your customer service.  It's super simple.  Politeness goes a long way.  If you see that other restaurants are offering it, you may want to consider (at least) duplicating the same system (i.e. refills, reusable cups, service to a whole party at one time, etc.).    Once again, if customer service is of no consequence to you and decent Italian food is your only desire, then this is the place for you.

Ladies, leave your backpack purses at home. They force you to lock it up outside of the store. The greeter and security were rude and this rule is offending. We will NEVER come back here. Ever. Eat a dick, Walmart. And you read that right, they told my wife to lock her purse up in one of their lockers outside of the store. We spend lots of money at Wal-Mart and have even cleared shelves on a few occasions. I'll never go this location ever again.

Revive massages are the best and most cost effective options in massage therapy. My wife and I took advantage of their super cheap introductory massage session and bought a few sessions beyond because they are that good. Rhonda, George and Nick were a few of the many excellent people on staff that we used. Rest assured, we will be back for more since it is in the same building as my chiropractor.  The front desk staff is exemplary and they always have smile on their faces. Look out for Al, this man will always leave you feeling great about yourself and more positive than when you arrived.

Ah man, this stuff is great! If you can imagine a pizza version of subway (but good) then you'd have My Pie. It's inexpensive, quick and tasty as hell. I'm a repeat customer and any time I'm in the area I'll grab My Pie every time.

I'll make it no secret here - I hate driving in this crazy valley traffic. Any opportunity I have to avoid it, I will. So rather than get a rental car when I put my wife's car in the shop, we relied on a couple taxi services.  Now, I had a poor experience with using Uber when I visited Chicago a few months ago. The driver showed up on time, but she got lost in the process of taking us to the airport. Then we were charged for the extra miles. Not cool. So, I haven't used that service ever since.   I simply googled up Scottsdale (we were hanging out in the area) cab and of the first choices, Scottsdale Cab Company came up. I figured I'd give them a shot and boy was I not disappointed.  The driver was on time, didn't get lost and probably got me to where I needed quicker and safer than what I could've attempted. The cab was roomy which is essential for my tall frame!   Tell me, since when do taxis have WiFi available? Am I late to the table on this development? They freaking have WiFi! That's huge to me so I don't use data while traveling. I know, its the small things in life.  Clean, professional and cost effective. That's my take on Scottsdale Cab Company. I'd highly recommend them when you are in need. Don't fuss with the others. Trust me, you won't regret it.

It was a very quick and efficient service.  He came on time, performed the service, and left.  He did return because he forgot to check one thing.  Clearly, he could have been on his way and thought "oh well".  I thought it was nice that he came back to make sure he had inspected everything.

Had exceptional service on a Friday morning at 9am. We were seated immediately, promptly greeted and taken care of by our waiter. Our order came out in minutes and there wasn't a thing wrong with the order. The place appears new and is super clean. I will return here if I'm in he neighborhood again.

I'm at the first open house of this truly special gym. This is an amazing playground for kids that identifies their needs and provides an outlet for them to learn, express themselves and grow. This is such a fun atmosphere and has so many cool things that all I want to do is play all day long on their trampoline, soft cushioned mat flooring or fly down on their zip line. There's far too many amenities for me to list in this post. And the neat part is that it's all scientifically-based learning and play that is appropriate for all kids affected on the autism spectrum disorder.

Oo-we! Vegan House was exceptionally good and they had a lot of excellent choices. I tried the "Chicken Supream" (sic) and it was REALLY good. Our server was super polite and spoke in broken English. But that didn't stop her from making this a superior dining option. The prices are a little above average but the food certainly is worth it. I loved the complimentary soup. Tasty! I will definitely return here
