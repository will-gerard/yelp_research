This is a place to stay away from.  Because they have been in business so long they think they can do what they want to the customers.  Despite the staff recommending a shoe as a good tap shoe, and despite the owner putting taps on the shoe, when it didn't work for the dancer as a tap shoe, the owner not only refused to stand behind the sale of the shoe and his workmanship, but he was rude about not making things right.  In a day in age when online shopping is quick and convenient, retail stores should be bending over backwards to be helpful to their customers.  Barry is not.  Stay away from Dee's Dancewear.  Poor Dee would be sick to see her sons doing such a lousy job with her namesake.  Shame on them!

Very nice but expensive. Medicare and AARP don't cover compounded prescriptions.

We spent two evenings at Maricopa Manor to celebrate my birthday.  Joan and Scott are relatively new owners and they do a great job.  This is truly an oasis in the uptown section of Phoenix just northwest of the corner of Camelback and Central.  The light-rail is walking distance as well as an A.J's, See's Candies, DQ, and Applebees.  We parked the car once (off street parking is very nice) and didn't use it until we left.  We enjoyed the pool and full breakfasts both days.  (Same breakfast both days - my only suggestion is it would have been nice to have a different entree.  The fresh fruit cup was very nice!  Loved the gluten free muffins.)  The bed was very comfortable - nice to have comfy robes - and the snack basket was great for late night snacks.  Perfect get-away right in town!  We highly recommend this lovely B&B!  DK and Alexx

Sorry, but something must have happened to this place since Ellen J. and Monica B. wrote their reviews.  My girlfriend and I went there tonight for our monthly sushi fix and to catch up.  It was nice to have it so quiet - we were the only ones in the restaurant for an hour - but we understand why.  The service was attentive but the food was poor.  The portions are small - you get twice as much at most other places for the same price - the happy hour offered nothing of interest - and they do not have a full bar as is listed - only beer and wine.  Imitation crabmeat?  Sorry - that's just not authentic fare and definitely not serious sushi.   We were very disappointed.  Fortunately the conversation was good!  But we won't be back here again.

This is my favorite morning getaway for the best tea and scones...ever!  My favorite place to sit is on the patio but the decor inside is so lovely that it's a treat as well.  The staff and owner are very pleasant and attend to every need before you think of it.  I brought a large group of women from my monthly lunch group for a fabulous luncheon. The portions were generous and the food was excellent.   All forty of us enjoyed the afternoon which included a short presentation by the tea leaf reader that we arranged for as well.  We allowed time to browse the lovely gift shop next door and a few of the gals stopped to have their tea leaves read.  Jo, the owner made everything so simple to organize and a real treat for everyone.  I still love my morning stops on my own, but I'd take a large group here again in a heart beat.  It's always a must do spot when friends come to town too.  Carefree is such a lovely place to shop, browse, and enjoy the mixture of mountains and desert scenery.  Adding a visit to The English Rose Tea Room makes the trip just perfect!

No great shakes.  Overpriced and small portions.  Seaweed salad was good but service was extremely slow.  Second time there - probably won't go back again.  Disappointing because it was my birthday dinner.

Every time I see Alaina for my hair it's a great day. She is a master at color and cut not to mention time spent in her chair is always a great catch up time. She always introduces her clients to each other so when you are changing chairs in the process of color you never feel awkward. I have met some of the nicest people in her salon. The salon is small so attention to each customer is always a priority. Great location too for fun shopping after getting beautiful!

No sign - door is locked. Voicemail is still working but at 1:30 pm on a Saturday this place is definitely not open for business.

Convenient salon for North Scottsdale people (Terravita MarketPlace) across from the Boulders. The salon is spotless (they use liners in their pedi bins), the staff is courteous and skilled, and the prices are reasonable. Everything I look for in a quality salon is walking distance. This is my go-to place! Definitely check this place out.

Attractive place - fast service- friendly staff - AWESOME food. Stew was fabulous and filling- salad crisp and fresh- rice done to perfection- gyro meat outstanding. We will definitely return after the next movie outing!
