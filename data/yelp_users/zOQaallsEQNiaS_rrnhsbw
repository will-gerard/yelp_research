Escape and de-stress! We had a lovely soak here. Simple, natural environment. I prefer this to the hoity toity natural mineral spas. I enjoyed the communal feel just like my native Arcosanti. The staff were all very sweet, helpful and welcoming. They have quite a few private soaking areas as well as public.    We were in a private area with a fire pit, lounge chairs, 6-8 person soaking tub and an area under the trees for a tent.   We enjoyed the warm tub, the cool air and the stars! Next time it'll be an overnight stay!

Ever had one of those days that no amount of planning could pre-empt some sort of a glitch? We had a last minute need for a boutineer when all the florists were either closed or didn't have anymore. I called them frantic in their last 30 minutes before close and they were friendly and offered to make one last minute! Day was saved! The boutineer was beautiful and thoughtfully put together. I will be back when I need flowers again!

I'm not a big Starbucks fan but I have a gift card from work and it'll do in a pinch. The drive thru line wrapped all through the parking lot so I parked and went inside. The staff was courteous and I just had a plain coffee.  The other clientele I found to be pretty snotty self entitled yuppies. In the parking lot, I almost get hit by some guy rushing through. I start backing out and this guy jumps in his sports car slams it into reverse and almost hits another car and leans on his horn!!!  Anyways, it's been awhile since I've been to a Starbucks and now I remember why.

If your looking for friendly people, fun times, and tasty drinks for a good price, this is the place!  I've been here on Saturdays for dancing and on Sunday's for a more laid back evening. Both nights were just what I wanted. Jamel and all the other employees are so helpful and I've had delicious Martinis here!  I love the Twisted Peacock!

Taste the difference with their high quality ingredients. The flavors are just right. I've been having issues of late with many of the restaurants downtown having over salted food. Not this place. The music was the perfect level to build a relaxed ambience yet still have a conversation.  I had the Rocky Point and it was delish. The chocolate pecan cookies for dessert were the perfect end for my meal and tied with the delicious coffee.  My new favorite breakfast/brunch place.
