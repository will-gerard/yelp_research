I've been to Lux twice since they've made the move next door, and I figured it was ok to give a review. I have been to Lux countless times over the last few years. It has always been the place to see and be seen, with coffee service that is definitely above Starbucks, but I will admit struggles in certain areas.   Lux, in its former space, was a small shop, always packed and definitely had its crowd. If you weren't a part of the crowd, you'd receive a "look" of, "hey, who are you?!" Look past that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.  The new space, well... it caters to the exclusivity of the "hipster" crowd. Walk through the door that you THINK is the entrance... and wander around. The kitchen, espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service. Also, is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan? Or is that the staff? Who knows? Luckily I have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works. If you're not that lucky, best of luck to you, as you're left to your own sense of direction as how to order, sit down, etc. From what I gather, you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and they'll call your name when your drink is ready. However, I'm not sure about the cocktail bar. The only way I think you would order would be by sitting at the bar? Not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.  I will admit, I haven't ordered any food from Lux yet, apart from a pastry for my coffee. I had a croissant, which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino. I'm a fan of a free-pour cappuccino, however the cappuccino that I was served on this visit had the foam scooped on top. This confused me, because I saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one free-pour. Maybe it depends on the barista? Kind of inconsistent. I did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink. The bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender. It's awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink. Anyway, I ordered the "Number 47" cocktail with gin, Green Chartreuse, St. Germain, lime, mint and cucumber. I'm a huge fan of Green Chartreuse and gin so I was excited to try it. They didn't have any cucumber in house, so they made it without it. Jeff (the owner) commented, "Well today it's just the 46." Hmm... Alright. So I took a sip of the cocktail. It was decent. Nothing exciting at all. It was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail. It masked the green Chartreuse too much. It really NEEDED that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingredients.  Oh well... what can you do when the owner doesn't seem to mind that ingredients are missing?   Overall, props to Lux for being busy at 3pm on a Thursday afternoon and being a successful establishment, which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion. The coffee and pastry has remained the same, which is ok with me. However, the cocktail bar tries a little too hard, I think. Also, the decor and vibe has definitely turned Lux into the "hipster mecca" and excluded the general public from it's demographic. Which, I can't complain or comment too much, because they are doing just fine. The flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staff is less than considerate (with a few exceptions). There's my two cents, for whatever it's worth.

SanTan Brewing has become a regular destination for me in the East Valley, and even more so since moving to Gilbert. I've been coming here for about a year now. SanTan is a fantastic micro brewery the occupies an old bank in downtown Chandler. Anthony, the brewmaster, knows his craft and is creating some delicious beers.   Not to compare, or even pick on Four Peaks, because I love their beer but I think SanTan is where the grownups go to drink craft beer. Compared to Four Peaks, SanTan doesn't have the rowdy college crowd downing pitchers of beer and stumbling back to their dorm rooms. SanTan has a crowd that goes to meet up after work, a fun night out with friends, or a place to hang out and watch the game... all while enjoying some of the best beer in Arizona.   The staff at SanTan is great. Even after only our second or third time in the bartenders recognized us and began to know our beers. Cory, Amanda and Hailey are regular bartenders that are always there serving up great beer. They're attentive and very quick! We noticed this one Wednesday night, there were three or four behind the bar and the pub was packed. It was great to see all of them in sync and bustling about. All of them knew exactly what they were doing and moving around each other in a manner that was fun to watch. Even with them being so busy they were constantly checking on their patrons at the bar. Nice job guys!  For a micro brewery I don't have super high expectations for food, but I am constantly pleased. Their bar snacks such as nachos, soft pretzels, sliders, etc. are all very good and are a step up from typical bar food. Likewise, their fish & chips are great! Their happy hour is also very good. A 20oz glass of ice cold craft beer will only set you back $3.75!   I don't think I've tried a SanTan beer I didn't like. Their flagship beer, Devil's Ale, was rated 96 points from Draft Magazine. That's great! Devil's Ale is an American Pale Ale with great floral notes and just the right amount of hops to keep the beer crisp and clean. Their IPA, Hopshock, is a very dry and hopping IPA, but delicious as well. The Epicenter, Amber Ale, is what I would call a gateway beer. For those that are used to drinking cheap light beer, this a good seg-way into a craft beer. It might be a little dark and intimidating in color, but it's rich amber color is matched by a rich malt flavor that is incredibly smooth. I am a huge fan of trying their seasonal brews as well. Just ask them to sample whatever seasonal is on tap, and I can almost guarantee you will not be disappointed.

The most under recognized happy hour in the state, hands down.  I've been to Cork for a full dinner and wine, and it was one of the best meals I've eaten. The food was delicious, beautiful and the wine was amazing. The only reason I hadn't been back, well, I'm a college student. My wallet cannot afford such splurges on a regular basis.  However, happy hour is the place to be. A friend and I stopped by on a Friday afternoon to see what we could find to nibble on and sip. Almost all of their happy hour menu items are $8 (some are $5), and they are full size plates. Their champagne cocktails are $3, while their other cocktails and glasses of wine are $4.  Libations: Red Stag Bourbon Manhattan: I have a weak spot for bourbon, I don't know why, but I really enjoy its complexity. Their version of the Manhattan was pretty good, maybe a little sweet for me though. I prefer mine to have a little bit of a bite, and enjoy the flavor of the bourbon.  Grapefruit Basil Martini and the Pomegranate Blueberry Martini were also both pretty good. Though they would have been better with a cool garnish of a basil leaf and pomegranate seeds, respectively.   The Floral: This champagne cocktail had a splash of St. Germaine Elderflower. Very refreshing and a little bit sweet. It was a great flavor combination.  The Modern Classic: This is another champagne cocktail but with blood orange bitters. Being a man who enjoys bourbon and bitters, I was curious to try a champagne and bitters. This was awesome. The bitters gave it a little bit of a bite, but the blood orange flavor was brought out with the champagne. A very good drink.  Snacks: Daily Charcuterie Plate ($8): I imagine this changes daily, or weekly, but wow, what a plate for only $8! This plate had a few slices of thinly sliced meat, a great house-made pesto, a sausage and mustard, and even some luxardo cherries. It was a perfectly sized plate for two people to share and nibble on while talking and enjoying a drink. I would have easily paid $15 for what I got.  Duck Fat French Fries ($5): These were to die for. Rich and amazing, topped with Gruyere cheese and sea salt. There was a whole grain mustard aioli to dip. I could have eaten those all day.   Fork & Knife Hotdog ($8): This open faced hotdog had chorizo, Asadero cheese, caramelized onions, tapatio. Living up to its name, I had to eat it with a fork and knife. It could have easily been a meal in itself.  Wild Boar Meatloaf ($8): Meatloaf with a house-made ketchup on a grilled slice of Ciabatta bread was great. The meatloaf was very moist had great flavor, complimented by the house-made ketchup. The ketchup was good, but I think it was a tad thick and seemed to stick to your tongue as you ate.  I would probably have to be taken out back and shot if I didn't give these guys 5 stars because how can you not?! Great drinks, especially the champagne cocktails, and amazing small plates that max out at $8! Happy hour is how this college student can afford to enjoy the delicious, fresh cuisine that is found at Cork. If I have a Tuesday-Friday off of class or work I can definitely see myself taking my sweet girlfriend here for a light dinner via happy hour.

Posh. Wow Josh, you've got a gem here in Scottsdale. Talk about innovative and improvisational.   On the slow nights, Josh (the owner) will be patrolling the dining room or tending the bar. It's nice to see the chef/owner making an appearance on the floor and interacting with the customers.  Here's the deal. As your server hands you a menu, you begin to check off general things such as temperature you'd like your meat cooked, allergies, and anything that you don't like. Then you choose how many courses you'd like, and the optional wine pairing. The rest is up to the kitchen. Whatever is in season, whatever sounds innovative, it's all up to the discretion of Josh and his staff as to what you will be eating that night.  One of the best things was when my fiancé and I went, we each got a different plate for each course. We had the 5 course meal, but tried each others so we ended up trying 10 different plates. How cool!  Sitting at the chef counter and watching the kitchen prepare your dish is one of our favorite things to do, which is why we elected to sit at the bar where we could watch our meal be created. It was also nice to run into local restaurateur/chef James Porter and his wife Wendy (Petite Maison, Big Earl's BBQ).   The kitchen staff is keen on presentation and meticulously preparing each plate, and it stands out. The food was cooked perfectly, looked incredible, and tasted amazing. We got to try some interesting dishes, along with some staples. I had a soft shell crab with a chipotle aioli and butter lettuce that was to do die for.  The alligator was great. And I think the most intriguing dish we had was monkfish liver. It was savory, but not too fish-y. Loved it.  Thanks to Josh for sending a couple extra tastes to the bar. Taylor and I enjoyed every bite. It was nearly too much food for us!  Posh also has a great bar menu with twists on some classic cocktails along with an extensive wine list. Be sure to check out their Late Night specials that start at 10pm on Wednesdays, it's a less expensive way to experience Posh.  Not an everyday restaurant, but definitely worth the splurge every once in a while for a special occasion.

Food: Ordered a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine. Their "Board & Bottle for $20" deal on Monday and Tuesday nights (8pm-close) is a great deal and perfect for a simple  and inexpensive date night. The board of bruschetta comes with your choice of 4 different combinations for you to pick from. We had the brie & apples with fig spread. This is a simple and common combination, matching brie with a light fruit. Almost a "dessert" because of how sweet and light it is. The warm artichoke spread was simple, and was essentially and artichoke dip spread on a piece of bread. It was still good though, and nice and warm. The ricotta with dates and pistachios is my personal favorite. It's a great flavor combination and something I order every time I go. We also ordered the red pepper and goat cheese bruschetta. Goat cheese goes well with so many vegetables, and this was no exception. To go with our board of bruschetta we ordered a bottle of the Chasing Lions, which is a cab-merlot blend. It was smooth and a very dynamic wine. I enjoyed it. Definitely a wine I would look for at Total Wine or BevMo! to have on hand at the house.  Service: The service was pretty good. We arrived at about 7:45 for their 8:00pm special. We were able to sit down immediately and our waitress brought us water and a small plate of olives. We told her we knew we were early for the special, and at a little after 7:50 she told us it was "close enough" and we could order for the special. Simple gestures like that are really great and help make a restaurant's staff shine. The seats that we were in were right under a speaker (the music was sort of loud) and it was hard to talk. We asked if we could move to the bar and she gladly moved us a few feet away to where we wanted. Sitting at the bar, we noticed that they had wine on tap. They are the first place in Arizona to do this, and I have seen it become a trend in San Francisco. The bartender gladly poured us a sample of the wine. It was nice to see them willing to share and give a sample of a new product to entice their customers. It was pretty good, too!  Ambiance: The ambiance as far as architecture and structure is very similar to the original Postino in Arcadia, along with La Grande Orange and Liberty Market. There are exposed trusses, and brick walls that add some flair and history to the building. I love that the space occupies an old bank and they utilize some of the existing structure for their design. I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the noise level. I understand that it is a wineBAR but the music was abnormally loud, and didn't need to be with the amount of people and conversation going on in the building. Definitely a hip and trendy place for young 20 somethings to be, and spotted plenty of people that were easily in their 50's.

I've visited Giant Coffee many times, and I'm finally getting around to writing a review. I think my last experience pushed me over the edge to finally writing it.   Whenever I'm in Phoenix and looking for coffee I usually head to Giant. Nothing against Lux or Lola just down the street, but Giant is more focused on their product. Giant has a standard of sourcing great coffee and using high quality product.  On my last visit I ordered a cappuccino and it was nearly perfect. Warm, but not too hot. Smooth by still having a strong espresso dynamic. Perfect balance. Before I left I went up to the counter to order a cup of coffee to go. They have a great setup for to-go coffee. They brew great coffee in large quantities so that those who are on the go can get a great cup of coffee quickly. The barista was very sweet and informed me the coffee had been sitting for a while. She said it would be a few minutes and she would brew me a fresh pot. It was the middle of the week, and I think there were only two other people in the shop, who had already ordered drinks. How easily could she have served me that mediocre cup of coffee? Very. But this showed her integrity and pride in their coffee to brew a whole new batch just for me. It's the little things like that that impress me the most.  I recommend this coffee shop for anyone in the downtown Phoenix area. Not to mention the cool sliding glass doors in front that they open up when the weather is nice. There's some comfy chairs and cook wooden tables to sit and enjoy the weather from.  PS. The clothing boutique next door is also cool. I found a great hat there.

It's a given that Sam Fox controls most of the Scottsdale dining scene with his plethora of restaurants along Scottsdale Road. His concepts and food appeal to the masses and can draw crowds any day of the week. There is a downfall to that: It allows for a slip of service and quality of food. I only base that off of the fact that I have dined my way through the Fox Restaurant Concepts and not always been wowed by the food. Given that fact, I have always been weary of trying Modern Steak because of its location and assumed price tag.   Modern Steak is the best Fox restaurant that I have dined at. Though it is upscale, a little gaudy, and pricey... It was delicious. Paying $17 for a burger and fries is more than a little steep, but what can you do? I will say that it was one of the better burgers that I've had in the Valley, apart from Liberty Market and Delux Burger. We also had the maple glazed salmon with sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts for $26. It was cooked absolutely perfect and was a great combination of favors. One of the appetizers is a foot long Kobe hot dog with a handful of toppings for $18. I understand it's Kobe, but come on, that's too much. We also shared the truffle fries that were $9 and worth every penny.   The meal would have not been complete without a couple of cocktails. The spiced appled Manhattan was $11 and a good cocktail. It was smooth, well balanced but not a Manhattan at all. I was expecting a Manhattan to have vermouth in it, but there was none to be found. There was Grand Marnier, though? The only "Manhattan" component was bourbon. Disappointing. We also ordered the Old Town Negroni for $10. This drink had the components of a Negroni, but added more. It had fresh squeezed orange juice and soda, served in a Collins glass. It didn't even taste like a Negroni anymore. Though, with how sweet the drink was, I could now see how it appealed to the masses.   The food was stellar, though maybe overpriced for what it was. However, you are paying for the location and ambiance, which is nice. With that being said, I see a lack of passion when it comes to cocktail service and looking for a little higher check average with mediocre alcohol by appealing to the masses. Don't settle for less because it's easier, take a small step up and do everything with excellence and this restaurant could easily be a 5-star.  P.S. This was for a family member's birthday and the staff was accommodating and didn't even charge a plate fee when we brought our own cake in. Also, they were not rushing us out at all after they had closed and we were still chatting and enjoying each other's company.

Hands down, FnB is my favorite restaurant in Arizona. This small gem in Old-Town Scottsdale is a unique, classy place with food and service that are nothing short of stellar. Sitting down at the high top bar that encompasses the cooking suite is my favorite place to dine. Being able to engage with chef Charleen Badman and the kitchen staff as they prepare your food is a key element in the dining experience. However, the unforgettable experience begins as soon as you walk in the door. Pavle Milic runs the front of the house and is the most sincere and charming man you will ever meet. His passion for serving and fussing all over patrons gives FnB a unique charm. The interior makes you feel like you're in a street-side cafe in New York.  I've been here many times and decided it was finally time to write a review. I remember last year I brought my mom in on Mother's Day and we tried the Braised Leeks with the Fried Egg ($13). We wanted to try a dish that was different than something else we would normally order, and this hit the spot. No wonder it was listed as one of the 10 Best Restaurant Dishes of 2010 by Food & Wine. This was an amazing dish, and something only Charleen could come up with. I love her dynamic approach to taking the "ugly" vegetables and turning them into delicious food.   Pavle features an exclusive Arizona wine list, and rightly so. Arizona wines have much to offer and Pavle is a strong supporter of Arizona wines. I am a huge fan of Sam Pillsbury's wines, and always happy to have a glass of the Diva or Roan Red ($13) at  FnB. Pavle also does cocktails right. The Sundowner - Aperol and bubbly ($9) is done perfectly, reminding me of my trip to Italy. For a special after-dinner drink, the Chartreuse VEP ($16) is an exquisite beverage and worth the splurge.   Pavle, his wife Emily, Charleen and the whole staff are one of the main reasons I go back. Their friendship that was built through this little restaurant is very valuable. The food is innovative and takes simple food and does it in ways that you wouldn't have thought.   One final note, working in the foodservice industry, I absolutely love the late night food that is available on Saturday nights from 10-midnight. The vibe changes and it's a hangout where you can grab a great dish (chilaquiles!) and a cold local beer.

The Vig Uptown... What a cool, hip place to be. This is the Vig's second location to their 40th Street location. Uptown is a little farther from my area of town, being located on 16th Street & Bethany Home, but I definitely don't mind the drive to enjoy a spiffy drink in a sweet setting. Taking an old bank and converting it into a modern tavern is always a cool layout for a modern hangout. The history of the building gives residents in the area familiarity with the building and helps it become a casual meeting place.  Bocce Ball is one of the best casual games to play and it's perfect while hanging out with friends having a drink and some decent food. Uptown has created an atrium with large windows to open when the weather is under 100 haha and closed to also allow natural light into the patio. The bocce ball area is somewhere I could spend all afternoon and evening hanging out with friends.   The Vig does a great job at their design work to create the cool, hip place to be... somewhere you can spend hours. The drinks here are also why this modern tavern is one of my favorite places to go. They do really good renditions of cocktails that utilize seasonal and fresh fruits, etc. in their drinks. One of my favorites is the Bombasiled ($9): Bombay Sapphire Gin, strawberry puree and fresh basil and a splash of lemonade is a great fresh cocktail. A favorite with the night crowd, that I've noticed, is the Statutory Grape ($9): 3 olives grape vodka, blue curacao, sweet n' sour, grenadine and Sprite. They also have a great selection of craft beers on tap, including the local Four Peaks Brewery.   The food here at the Vig Uptown is also very good for being a modern tavern. Elevated bar food would be close to short changing the food here. Their sweet potato fries are probably my 2nd favorite sweet potato fry in the Valley to accompany the very good VigAzz Burger.   Overall, this is a great place to hang out, have a drink, some good food and enjoy the company of friends. And one of the perks to the Vig.... the VigRig: Their complimentary shuttle service for those who occasionally indulge in the decadent adult beverages.  PS. My only qualm... Cougars. Yikes!

Wednesday, October 27, 2010. Opening Night.  As we walked in we were greeted by Michelle Beckett (owner/partner) and she had even recognized me from my comment on their facebook page. This meant a lot because it shows that they are taking time and investing in the utilization of social networking. They want to know their customers and build the relationships to become that "neighborhood hangout," or a true Third Place.   The decor of the building is absolutely perfect. The dark wood, exposed trusses, brick wall, open kitchen are all inviting and comforting. They did a good job of expressing their business concept in their design; they aren't trying to be pretentious or snooty. They are down to earth and simple with the decor and aesthetics which leads them into being a comfortable neighborhood hangout. I was impressed with the wait staff. They were knowledgeable and had tried everything on the menu. This allowed them to give recommendations and answer questions. Likewise, they weren't your typical high school or college servers. They were seasoned wait staff, and it was apparent. My only comment on the service would be that the timing was a little bit off from ordering 1st course, 2nd course, and the time for our after dinner cocktails. However, these are minimal kinks I would expect on night one, so I see it as a nonissue.   Now for the food. The four of us decided to share the Beckett's Original Grilled Cheese ($9). This grilled cheese had four cheeses and pancetta. It was delicious, and the roasted red pepper soup to accompany was great. This plays a lot into Beckett's concept. It's not food that you can't make at home, he's just going to do it a little better, and for a fare price.  We ordered a bottle of Page Springs Grenache ($41). It was very nice to see a handful of local wines on the list, this is something that I think all local restaurants should strive to do. It was nice to see chef Justin Beckett be able to escape the kitchen and make rounds in the dining room to greet his guests and thank them for coming, etc.  For our main courses we had the Wood Fired Mussels ($18), Fork Tender Short Ribs ($19), Local Pork Osso Buco Confit, and Chicken n Dumplings ($16). The mussels were great. It seems a lot of restaurants are serving mussels in a white wine broth these days (Beckett's Table, Iruna, Liberty Market, etc.). Each of them does it a little bit different, and Beckett's take on this dish is using a fennel broth. Normally I am not a fan of fennel, but it was mild enough, and with the other spices it was a good combination. My only concern (not even a complaint) was the portion of the dish. I had 32 mussels in my bowl. I spoke with Justin after we ate and he mentioned that that was not the correct amount.  However, we discussed portioning and he is definitely being generous with the amount of mussels in this dish. I'd say it's a great deal! The short ribs were cooked to perfection, and lived up to the name "fork tender." They were seasoned well with a nice bite of cracked black pepper. A very generous portion as well. The pork osso buco was delicious. It was tender and flavorful. Its side of butternut squash spaetzle was a nice touch. My little brother ordered the chicken n dumplings. These were delicious, and Beckett's take on this nostalgic dish includes saffron in the cream sauce. It created a very smooth flavor that definitely set it apart from all other chicken n dumplings (except our family recipe, of course).   We thought about dessert... and well... we had to. Chocolate dipped bacon s'mores. Wow. Another great taste combination, taking the smokey, salty flavor of the bacon and dipping it in the sweet chocolate was great. Their marshmallows are house-made, which is just a nice touch. It did come with a dollop of peanut butter whipped cream that complimented the dish.   Likewise, we ordered after dinner cocktails. I ordered the Legend City Cocktail. The name is something that will be nostalgic for those that have grown up in the Valley. This drink I feel was a great twist on a classic Old Fashioned. It was Woodford bourbon, Ricard, bitters and a splash of lemonade: served straight up. I thought it was delicious, but I have began to acquire a bias for classic bourbon cocktails. My mom ordered Miss Katie's Pimms Cup. This drink is named after one of the owning partners Katie Stephens, who also came around to our table and introduced herself and chatted with us for a few minutes. My dad, growing up on a farm appreciated and ordered the AZ Farmhand. It contains Hendricks Gin, ginger, lemonade, honey syrup and a splash of soda. Very refreshing drink as well.  I will be back Beckett and his staff have done a GREAT job opening this new neighborhood hangout.

I've been to a handful of cigar shops in the Valley, and Fox takes the cake. Hands down. With a vast humidor that has more cigars than you could think of and an incredible bar to match.  The staff is extremely friendly and very knowledgable of their tobacco and alcohol. Their prices on everything are very reasonable. I have noticed that the majority of their cigars range from $5-8 a piece. Now their alcohol is on the same page as their cigar selection. They literally have hundreds of whiskies, scotches, bourbons, tequilas, rums, etc. Not to mention the tap with a handful of craft and local beers.   Sit down in one of their leather chairs and have a Gurkha, cognac infused cigar and sip a glass of scotch on the rocks. Don't worry about missing the game, they've got plenty of televisions with the game on. Don't be mistaken, this is NOT your dive bar to watch the game. This place is better, plus they don't' serve any food.  Mitchell Fox (owner) is usually around, and even helped me out the other night. He gave some great ideas on cigars for guests for my upcoming wedding and was more than accommodating in what we were looking for.  Every time I've gone there's a handful of people in there, usually middle aged men having a smoke and talking. Very nostalgic and what you would expect and old school cigar bar to be like. You'll find locals with their laptops getting some work done, men hanging out, fathers and sons getting together, and if you're as fortunate as I am... you'll be there with your fiancée enjoying a cigar and scotch.  I have a feeling that I will become a regular, and with their prices and customer service, there's absolutely no reason not to.

So needless to say, my visit to BLD today was a bit underwhelming. I've heard a few friends talk about the food being hit or miss at times, and I've experienced it a time or two myself. I went in at around 1:30pm on a Wednesday. It was after the lunch rush and things were quiet. I think there were 2 ladies at the bar, and maybe 4 other two-tops seated in the restaurant. Our server was taking care of us and two other tables (both two-tops). It took her between 5-10 minutes to come over and greet us and take a drink order. I noticed the same situation going on for one of her other tables. When she came and took our food order she was nice and recommended the onion rings for a sandwich side because they are her favorite. Naturally, we took her advice.   Here's where I began noticing a trend in the service. It took a little over 15 minutes for our food to arrive. Now, I'm normally not a critique of time it takes for food to arrive, since I'm in the industry, however this was kind of sad. We ordered a burger (medium-rare) and I had the green chili pork sandwich. My sandwich I guarantee was cooked and just had to be assembled. The burger was mid-rare and should have taken 5-7 minutes to cook. I've seen them busier and cook food faster, there just seemed to be no sense of urgency. I noticed that the FOH manager also comp'd a two-top's French Onion Soup because he knew it took, "a lot longer than it should have." Not sure if they brought that to his attention or if he had noticed. Nothing happened with ours, and the server didn't really acknowledge an almost 20 minute was for two sandwiches. Like I said, I'm not one of those to get upset or critique because I am a part of the industry.   As for the food, I've been there a handful of times and some times it has been very good, other times it was alright, and this time was just alright. Again, the food was lacking seasoning. It was just bland. Even a pinch of salt would have made a world of difference, and I had mentioned it to them before.  Going there for breakfast, I had heard their eggs Benedict menu was great. I'm a fan of hollandaise sauce so I thought I'd check it out. I ordered the BLD Benedict, which is your classic eggs benny, with ham, egg and hollandaise on an English muffin. It was incredibly salty. I thought it might just be the ham, but as I kept eating it got even worse, and it was the hollandaise that was so terribly salty. We mentioned it to our server. She offered to get us something else, but we declined and just wanted to bring it to her attention. A few minutes later the manager came over and offered to get us something else, and told us that they had tasted the sauce and it was indeed way too salty. When our bill came, we noticed that they had comp'd our two eggs Benedict orders. We hadn't asked for that and I thought it was a nice gesture. The attitude of the manager was excellent and professional in handling the situation. However, this was kind of a "third strike and you're out" moment for the food at BLD. I think in my five times there I have really only enjoyed one of my meals enough to recommend to people as a definite, "YES, go there."   The food being just ok, and not stellar is sad but acceptable, especially since I have very high expectations because of Cork. Which, by the way, is probably my favorite restaurant in the East Valley and have the same partners. But overall, I just don't see myself running back to eat at BLD anytime soon. You better believe you can find me down the road at their other restaurant, Cork.

Windsor, the newest addition to the Demarco list of hip places in the Valley (until Gilbert Postino opens next to Liberty Market).   Not that I know anything about classic cocktails, but I've begun to dive into this new revival of old school, classic beverages. Winsdor has a great take on this new trend, and does the "pub food" to match. I've been to Windsor a handful of times, had every cocktail on the menu and I've also tried a few of the beers and wines. My favorite cocktail is the No. 35. The combination of scotch, St. Germain and lemon has an incredible balance and is an easy and strong drink. The wines at Windsor are all on tap (a new trend in New York and California). I am a fan of the wines on tap, for the price, quality and the amount of waste (nearly zero) that the restaurant has on such a drink. The food at Windsor is a little more than elevated bar food. My fiancée and I love getting the Russian Roulettes for a bar snack, which consists of roasted green peppers. Most are mild, but you'll get that one that has a bite! For a little heftier of a plate we will share the Smorgasbord which has a house cured salmon, white bean dip, cheese, nuts, etc. Those two are perfect for an afternoon of cocktails and snacks.  Like Postino, they offer glasses of wine, pitchers of beer and specialty cocktails for only $5 before 5pm.   Some people like the vibe and decor, others seem to think it's a little too cliche. I think the decor and design is excellent. Small aspects remind me of Postino and stick with the Demarco way of restaurant design. However, some of the themes are reminiscent of the vintage cocktail revival and reminds me of the craft cocktail bar, Craft & Commerce in souther California.  Overall, this is a great place for a casual and quiet afternoon snack and libation. If it wasn't 35 miles from my house you could probably find me there a couple of times a week.  Nice job Craig, and staff. Keep up the great work and I look forward to seeing Postino Gilbert open in the beginning of the year.

I had some high hopes for Citizen R+D. Noticing a revival of classic cocktails and bartenders beginning to take a pride in their craft, I was excited when I heard about the "speakeasy" upstairs from Citizen Public House. It's hard to argue that Richie Moe isn't a great "mixologist," though I would rather stick with the term "bartender." He knows his alcohol and has a palate for pairing those with small nibbles. However, because this is Scottsdale, I don't think that allows an automatic 20% gratuity on EVERY cocktail after they are already on the high end as far as price goes.  Following the trend of revived speakeasies and classic cocktails, the entrance to R+D is pretty cool. It's more of the event and experience that helps set the tone for the night. Walking through an alley to a lit staircase is cool, and it makes you feel like you're walking into something special. We called the number to get in, waited for about 5 minutes for a Richie to come outside and let us in. A 5 minute wait isn't bad to be granted access into an exclusive bar... but there was only two other people in there.  We ordered two drinks, A Monk's Life $11(gin, yellow chartreuse, grapefruit juice, muddled blackberries, lavender sugar and candied ginger), and G + T $17(double-boiled R+D made citrus infused gin, fever tree tonic, and lime). The Monk's Life came out a few minutes later, delivered by Tara. She explained the drink and how we should nibble on the candied ginger while we sipped the cocktail, as it paired well together. She was right, it paired very well together. It added depth to the drink... which was otherwise flat. You could only notice a bite of the gin, and no chartreuse, over the sweetness of the grapefruit juice and lavender sugar. About 5 minutes after that drink was delivered, we were brought the set-up for our G+T. They use a double boiler to infuse Absolut 100proof vodka with dried juniper berries, citrus peel, anise, fennel, and a few other spices to create a "gin." As he lit the burner to begin infusing the vodka, he told us he would be back in about 5 minutes when it was finished. He came back with an ice bath to cool down the "gin" before he would pour it over ice. Richie said that would take maybe 2 minutes. We waited for between 10-15 minutes for him to return, only after we flagged him down, asking where our tonic was. He was apologetic and brought the rest of the set up for our drink. He apologized and took the drink off of our bill. As he poured the gin over ice and topped it with tonic, you could smell the anise in the drink. First sip, extremely over powering with the anise, I couldn't taste much of the juniper berries. After letting the drink dilute for a few minutes and adding the lime, you could begin to taste more of the flavors in the vodka.   I would have been content paying $17 for a G+T with a house made tonic and a very well sourced GIN, instead of an artisan tonic and juniper infused vodka.   Since my drink was done about 20 minutes after my dad had been served his cocktail, Richie offered to "sponsor" my dad's next drink. He obliged and ordered Smokey and the Bee $10(Jameson, Smoked almond + honey syrup, maca root, and grilled lemon). This drink was the best of the night. The smoked almond take on orgeat syrup was a great compliment to the Jameson, and the grilled lemon paired nicely with the honey in the syrup.   Overall, I was underwhelmed. I had high hopes because of all of the hype around this speakeasy type establishment. However, it didn't seem to live up to it's expectations. A lot of these drinks are things you could make for 1/4 the price if you did a little bit of research on where to find the liquors.   I'll come back and maybe try another cocktail or two, but I have a feeling that they are trying too hard with pairing and adding "tinctures" to their drinks instead of focusing on the actual liquors. Adding a flavor to enhance the alcohol's natural flavors is great, but it seems to be an afterthought when each drink has so many ingredients.

Usually you would never want to review a restaurant after one experience, on day one, but it was something that had to be done. In fact, my dad and I were the first two customers, and were immediately fussed over by the master of schmoozing, Pavle Milic. Him and partner Charleen Badman have teamed up for a simpler concept to the ever classy FnB.  This 20-something seat cafe is very casual and comfortable that you don't even notice sitting at the bar for two hours over a bottle of wine and a few appetizers. The staff, very similar to the staff at FnB. Some of the same people, fussing all over you and taking care of you is a great feeling. We ordered a bottle of Dos Cabezas 'Red,' which is their red table wine. I'm a huge fan of Dos Cabezas, and for them offer a bottle for under $40, I was very pleased. We needed some food, so we ordered their marinated olives. A standard, but good nonetheless. The pork rillette was absolutely amazing. Rich, savory, salty and delicious. Coming in a glass jar, surrounded by lard, we knew this was going to be amazing. It also came with a small pickled salad of radishes and whole grain mustard that were excellent compliments. We couldn't stop spreading the rillette on the freshly toasted crisps, and had to get more to finish. It was an excellent portion size.   We were in the cafe for two hours, had a bottle of wine, a bowl of olives, and the pork rillette. It was more than enough food, and with tax and tip it was roughly $60. That's an excellent deal. If we would have substituted the olives out for something larger portioned, like a salad or sandwich, the bill would have only been $3 more, and that would be a full meal for two.  I think Pavle and Charleen are going to blow Old Town away with Baratin. The price points are so great, the quality is impeccable, and the service is flattering. I feel like this is the perfect compliment to FnB. Baratin allows for the same quality of food but it's more accessible than the white table clothed FnB. Also, a huge benefit is their two retail concepts on either side of Baratin. To the left is AZ Wine Merchants that is your one-stop-shop for any Arizona wine you could dream of, including all of the local wines they serve at Baratin. And to the right, there's Bodega, which is a local foodie's paradise; sourcing fresh produce and locally made goods.  Cheers to Baratin!

Congratulations on opening the Gilbert location. Glad to see you guys making the shift to the far East Valley. As to be expected, the bruschetta was great. We really enjoyed the Syrah and the Sangiovese. It's really hard to beat the $5 glass/pitcher deal before 5pm, and the board + bottle ($20) on Monday and Tuesday night make for the perfect date night, though it can prove to create a long wait.  It was nice to see staff from the other locations making the move out here. Small mishaps and things that get confused in the midst of opening a new restaurant are bound to happen. No worries though, we've been 5 times in the first 10 days, showing that you guys are right on target. Looking forward to getting to know the staff and becoming weekly regulars.

Agritopia finally exists as an establishment to Yelp! about. I believe that Agritopia is one of the premiere developments in the state for everything you want in a neighborhood. As I write this, I hear birds chirping in the trees and can spot residents cycling through the streets, enjoying the meticulously landscaped neighborhood.  When I first ventured out to Gilbert, nearly 4 years ago, I drove by Agritopia and immediately thought, "This is a neighborhood from Desperate Housewives." Turns out, I was wrong. Dead wrong. I told myself that I could never live in a neighborhood that seemed like it was nothing more that a clean, pristine facade. However, nearly a year ago I moved into the neighborhood, and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Here's why:  Location: Direct access to the Loop 202 makes it easy to get anywhere in the Valley in about 30 minutes. Also nearby is San Tan Village Mall. The mall is growing and developing into a nice outdoor mall with mid-range to upscale shops.  Neighborhood: The neighborhood is beautiful and very well planned out. There are many styles of houses with differing floor plans. There's a home that is the right size for anyone. My parents have a single story, with a basement that is perfect for entertaining; while my wife and I have a small, two-story cottage, that is the perfect starter home for us. Agritopia boasts the smallest two-way streets in the Valley, to help promote pedestrian walkways and reduce the heat island effect within the neighborhood. Given the narrow streets, all homes are equipped with emergency sprinkler systems, reducing homeowner's insurance.  There is also a nice community center that is optimal for hosting small events (my wife and I had a wedding shower there, and the community has neighborhood events throughout the year). Not to mention the fitness room with workout equipment, and a nice pool that is even heated in the winter months.  The beautiful homes have front doors that face each other and promote social activity in front of the homes with neighbors. This is the optimal way to get to know who lives near you and build lasting relationships, which promotes a true sense of community.   Attractions: Keeping with the sense that this land was once a farm lives on for those in the neighborhood. There is a community garden where residents can have their own plot of land to plant, grow and harvest their own crops. (Also promoting sustainability!) There is also a commercial farm which supplies produce to the nearby Joe's Farm Grill and Liberty Market. Joe's Farm Grill is the popular restaurant built from the Johnston's old home. You may have seen them on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. This is a great lunch spot! Also, there is The Coffee Shop. Located in an old tractor covering, this coffee house has specialty espresso drinks and pastries. Jessica Cuff, owner, was on Cupcake Wars and took home 1st place for her delicious treats. The farm at Agritopia has a farm stand where the fresh, local, organic produce is available for purchase at extremely reasonable prices.  Keep an eye out for this becoming THE PLACE to be in Arizona. Plans for an assisted living development are in the works to break ground this spring/summer. Also, the commercial corner (named the EpiCenter) is in planning stages. This will bring artisan products and establishments to the corner promoting local businesses, walkability, and gourmet food/drink.
