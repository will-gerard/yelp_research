This is my favorite "special occasion" spa. It's too expensive to go to on a regular basis, but when you have friends in town or are planning a spa day with friends, this is my favorite resort spa in town.   Here is why this one is special:  - The experience begins as you drive down the windy road with a serene desert vista. No houses or businesses to be seen.   - Because this spa is owned by Native Americans, their spa treatments have a NA theme to them. They use special products and techniques that are unique to their culture.   -The atmosphere is fantastic. Flute music playing, ice water with  strawberries served, nice couches to sit on, and a great little spa store.  -My favorite person to request is Belen.  In addition to being a massage therapist, she is a healer and provides great insight as she works on you. She suggested I do a cleanse, which I did, and the results were remarkable.   -Getting a treatment here is expensive, but worth it. You need to plan to spend the day there. If you get a treatment you can use their facilities which include a steam room, jacuzzi, workout room, sitting by the pool, and walking around the property.  -I'm not wild about the menu they have at the spa for lunch, but it's not bad.   Enjoy!

I really enjoyed this place and will use it from now on. I purchased a Groupon because I liked that they use organic products. They use a product there for calluses that was  used on me at a resort in CA, so I was happy to see they sold this, as it works like magic. They were very pampering and gave me a mini facial for free while my feet were being done. I love this place.

I love this place. I am one of these people who love spa services and love a good deal.   Here is what I recommend. Get on the email list for SWIHA, and you will get emailed all sorts of deals. They also have fun and intersting events if you are into the whole mind, body, spirit thing.  They offer free hypnosis, toe reading, and life coaching sessions on their first Friday events. Those are held in the evening and start with some sort of presentation  that is of a personal developement/spiritual nature, and then you break off and get to try one of their treatments. If KC Miller is speaking, you are in for a treat. She is the owner of the school, and a dynamic speaker.  Aside from the First Friday (they call it Gifts and Graces) they provide a free  hypnosis session, as their students need to practice,  so call on that one. It all depends on the student how well this goes. I've done it a few times, and some of them are great, and some are still learning. This is true everywhere, but the difference here is that it's free. You can always tip, and I do that. I have been hypnotized for getting organized and starting exercise programs, etc. I admit that I am still working on these things, so the hypnosis wasn't a magic bullet in my case! LOL  They also have massage there. You have the choice of a student or graduate. The prices vary depending on whether you get a student or not. I always request the student to save money.   My very favorite thing, however, is their facials. I always buy a package when they have their coupons out, and it makes it so that the facials are less than $20 each!!!!  Call and ask them when their next coupon comes out. It's a great way to go and get your face really cleaned nicely and relax.

This place does have good croissants. That is not their problem.   Whatever you do, do NOT order a breakfast sandwich. They microwave the egg in a plastic dish. It is completely unaccepatible. I am a bit of a health nut and was SHOCKED that a restaurant that makes such beautiful croissants would serve eggs like that. It doesn't taste good and it's not healthy. Everyone knows you don't microwave in plastic unless you want cancer.   Here's what they need to do. They need to focus on making better breakfast food to compliment the croissants. They also  need to call in a decorator to create a better ambience.  If they did these two things, they would be so busy they would have to move to a bigger location. Arizonians love a good breakfast after a hike, and this place currently doesn't cut it.

Do you enjoy eating food from different cultures? The owner of this place is Ethiopian, and you will get to know her if you eat there..... she is wonderful. She is very sweet and you will begin to understand Ethiopian culture simply by chatting with her. She cooks all of this food herself and she told us the bread takes a few days to make. She does hang around and talk quite a bit to custormers, which is part of the charm of the place. The restaurant itself  is small, but nicely decorated in a fun way. Brightly painted walls adorned with African artwork makes you feel as though you are in someone's home.   We got a vegan platter for two and it was wonderful. There were a few different lentil dishes and a salad served with Ethiopian bread that you use almost like a tortilla to pick up bites of your food. You don't use silverware, which is difficult when you are used to using a fork to eat. It was messy. You can bring your own wine to this place if you would like to.   My only suggestion would be for this restaurant to offer silverware to guests. It was a little tough eating the food without it.   Will I go back?  YES

I live in the neighborhood right across the street from this place and recently started going there. It seems like everytime I go in I see one of my neighbors. How is it I didn't realize it was there?    This is a cool coffee shop. It has an artsy feel to it that makes it fun and cozy. It's a warmer environment than Starbucks. I recommend this place. The coffee is very good, but it's the atmosphere that I love.

Monday and Wednesday at 9:30 Hegel Yoga  has the best  beginning yoga class I have ever taken. I felt like I really stretched and worked, but it wasn't so hard that I don't want to go back. She has other classes for people who are advanced, but I won't be attending those. I am sticking with her beginning class. Love it! HEr place is moving next week somewhere on Kyrene, so look up the new address.

I am a person who really enjoys spa treatments, so when I say this is the best facial around, I mean it. I have mild rosacea, and because I was taking a medication, it got WAY worse. I had acne on my cheeks and neck, which is not a problem I had ever had.   You won't believe this, so I hope you are sitting down....Michelle gave me a facial and an LED light treatment and my skin was almost completely healed the next day. I had been trying to clear this up on my own for about a month.  It was unbelievable. If you have rosacea, sensitive skin, or acne, you have to try this.    The reports about how nice Michelle is are correct. She does a really good job of massaging you while masks dry, etc. She is very attentive and service-oriented. For example, she  is always rubbing hands, arms, or feet in addition to your face. The table is very comfortable, sheets are high-quality and smell very spa-like with nice music in the background. Not only will your face look good, but it's a very enjoyable experience. I would go every day if I could. I highly recommend this place. Two thumbs up for sure.

This is a great "health nut" restaurant. The food is high-quality and tasty. They have a couple of raw entrees on their menu as well as vegetarian dishes. The place is busy, so their food is always fresh due to the quick turn-over of food. The  food is high-quality, so I would say the prices are fair. Anyone who shops at Whole Foods can appreciate the cost that went into this food.

The place is nice, but it's way too expensive for what you get. It should be under $5 per person. From a business perspective, they would probably make more money if they made the admission less than $5 because more people would consider going for that. I will never go again. It's simply a rip off. Sorry.

My boyfriend and I had dinner at Thai Buffet this evening. We discovered this place through Groupon. The atmosphere is not great, and they don't have wine, but the food was all homemade and very delicious. The woman who owns it is the cook and she is a hard worker and aims to please. I don't eat meat, so she made me a vegetarian curry. My boyfriend loved all the dishes on the buffet.  We will go back.

I love this studio. The restorative yoga class on Wednesday is great. I love yoga by candle light. The lobby smells wonderful...some sort of incense. Nice place.

This is the only place I go for massages anymore. The way this works is a bit different, so I wanted to explain. You need to wear loose fitting, comfortable clothing, as this is a clothed massage. I wear yoga pants and a T-shirt. They soak your feet and you get a full massage and the price is UNBELIEVABLE. What I love is you can call this place and make an appointment for an hour later. I have never called and been told I couldn't get in. They have several people working there and are eager to work. I love this place. Janet
