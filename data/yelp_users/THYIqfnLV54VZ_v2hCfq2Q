This is a perfect low key relaxing restaurant with great southwest food outside the usual tacos, fajitas, etc.  I sat outdoors today and there were kids present but it was quiet, and relaxing.  I ordered the southwest Caesar salad which was a perfect variation on a classic.  I then received my entree the Santa Fe stuffed chicken breast.  So flavorful and huge!  The asparagus was cooked perfectly.  I also got a free dessert for checking in on yelp.  There are small remnants of the previous Sams cafe but it's the good things.  Staff is friendly and low key.

My friend and I ended up here by accident but I'm glad we stopped by!  Service is very attentive here, and we were quickly seated.  We ordered the cheese crab puffs and the potstickers.  I'd pass on the cheese puffs, they had a bizarre flavor, that I still can't put my finger on.  The pot stickers were perfect.  I ordered the pepper beef and it was very good.  The red and green peppers were cooked just perfectly so they were not too soft or crisp and the beef was also done just right with the perfect amount of pepper sauce.  It came with white rice, which I'm not use to, since I usually have brown, but that was fine also.  Decor is fine, a little 60's china-ish but it seems to suit the place.  From the diverse crowd that was there last night enjoying themselves, it seems they agree with me.  This place is a hit.

Great place for collectors of Egyptian and Norsk items.  They also have great psychic reading specials 20 minutes for $15.00.  I had a female that was struck by lightning survivor give me a reading.  Unique perspective and did not feel like she fed me a bunch of crap.  She also claims to be a pet psychic, it may be quite entertaining to hear what my 2 year old Aussie shepherd might say about me.  Psychic specials tend to be on the weekends and it can get quite busy.  There is also a lot of mineral rocks and crystals.  I bought some blue rock upon suggestion, it sits on my dresser channeling verbal unspoken energy from the universe.  Not sure its happened yet but for the $1.00 I spent, I call it entertainment value.

The best eye doctor facility I've ever been to.  They were so thorough I was astonished.  Staff is pleasant and knowledgeable.  They take Federal spending account cards.  They utilized computer imaging to look into my eyes which was just amazing to look at while he explained the health of my eyes.  When asking about eye surgery because I'm slightly vain, he went over the benefits and effects and we determined it the benefits did not out weight the effects as my correction needed is not much.  Nice change from other places trying to sell everything including the kitchen sink.  They also had an upgrade in the glaucoma test, no more puffs!  We ordered contacts and with my insurance my portion was reasonable.  They even offered to mail my contacts if it was more convienent for me. Dr Kantor was funny and spoke to me as an intelligent eye care patient.  Then at the end he thanked me for choosing him, asked for my continued business and stated that if I liked the service I received to refer him to my family and relatives.  I'm officially a customer for life.  Lastly there was no dialiation test where you cant see anything for hours.  Thanks Central Phoenix Eyecare!

The staff is very unfriendly here unless you like getting barked at like a dog.  Saturdays are fun for the strippers, but the staff will take your drinks before your finished.  The staff need some serious training on customer service.

It's a dump, no it's a burp and slurp with beer, no it's a dumpy burp and slurp with booze, grease, a couple of tvs and a portable stripper pole.  This place use to be packed on various nights.  I stopped there last night for a beer and there were ten people there including the staff.  Sad, they've tried various tired approaches such as bar food, fish races and other crap.  Some staff there think they are running studio 54.  Hardly.  Try a wrecking ball, knock it down and something new.  Where's the coffin this place needs a proper burial.

This is a romantic diamond in the rough spot.  I came here with my dinner date and found it intriguing when we arrived, the doors were open and we could hear the greek guitar from outside.  We were ready!  The decor and seating is a throwback from the past, but we were here for the food and entertainment.  It's definitely here on  a Saturday.  Were were promptly seated ordered some Greek white wine and the saganaki.  Both were very good.  We then decided to order our entrees and our waitress was fun and playful.  While we waited, the belly dancing and greek guitar was going.  To make sure we were able to take part in the entertainment, the waitress offered us some plates.  We took one for each of us.  This was a fun hit, we threw the plates and broke them and it was a hoot.  When we received our food, it was great.  I had the chicken with artichokes and my date had lamb.  His was cooked just so perfectly it fell off the bone.  He got a thrill giving one of the belly dancers a tip, and then it was time for desert and the greek guitar.  It felt like we were on a greek island.  The chocalate cake was wonderful.  We were going to call it quits, but someone at the table next to us suggested that we finish off with one of the black licorice shots.  Yawsix!  This was a great time.  Now if I could just learn how to play that greek guitar....

I love the salon.  I took my four month puppy there for his first time.  He was shedding and since he was a puppy he gets into stuff all the time so it was time to get rid of the stinky puppy smell.  They make the appointment process easy, they called Banfield Pet hospital to verify his rabies shot so he could go.  The check-in was quick, they told me what they were going to do and the exact time it would take.  It took 2.5 hours and they called to let me know.  When I arrived my puppy Jax was ready for a commericial, he looked great!  Upon leaving they give you a completed report card of how he did and some coupons for the store.  Wonderful experience, only thing I didn't see was a gratuity area on the charge slip.  Guess I'll need to bring some cash next time.  Thanks Petsmart grooming!

I'm a Chipotle person, so for whatever reason, they were closed early, and decided to give Baja a try.  I ordered some spicy chicken nacho burrito thing that was suppose to be full of zip.  They hand you a small bag o chips and then you wait for your number to be called.  I got the burrito.  Flavor is lacking, and the zip is suppose to come from the peppers in the burrito-- that's it, the problem is there is more rice and beans in the thing than anything and the chicken had little flavor.  To make matters worse, the place has 4 or 5 televisions playing Fox news.  Yuckoo, I wonder what political party this place caters too.  Politics aside, I don't care for the food, the business model, or the decor.

Great sales on men's professional salon liters of shampoo and conditioner for us hair snobs.  They carry Joe Grooming for men,  the shampoo and conditioner work perfect for the desert climate here.  They have a number of colognes for men also bit you can find better pricing else where.  They also have a rewards program based on spending.  Store is clean.

Wonderful old school Greek.  Very friendly staff, you're treated like family.  The decor is wonderful I wanted to take a shopping bag of various items to decorate my place!  Food is great, saganaki is perfect, and the small plate gyros taverna was just right.  Hummus was excellent.  The Greek coffee looks wonderful but I passed.  I'll be back!

I was looking for a new bed frame for my new residence.  I previously purchased an Amisco bed which I've had for 8 years now, and they still sell the Newton model there today.  I was wanting something a bit different that they didn't have in stock.  I priced it at the Denmarket and then checked online.  I had spoken with the manager Mary at the time of my pricing.  I looked online and found it cheaper through an online competitor.  Due to the economy I figured I would give Copenhagen the opportunity to compete.  I mentioned the price the competitor was giving and the free shipping and Mary had given me 10% off with free shipping to match the competitor.  She told me it would take about 4-6 weeks for my special order that I wanted and it was just a couple days over.  The furniture delivery occurred today, and Josh was very friendly and attentive.  The bed turned out perfectly.  There was only one small glitch and that was they delivery staff forgot to leave the assembly directions for the bed as it is a platform bed and a bit different to put together.  I called the warehouse and they told me they could send me the assembly directions on the mail.  Copenhagen, you're a hit!  If I ever need another Amisco brand bed, you're first on my list.

i dropped off a script and waited and waited and waited, all for some needles and syringes.  Hmm nothing to combine, no insurance to bill just pick up and put in plastic bag.  After 15 minutes, I finally tell the pharmacist to call me as I had an appointment to go to.  Then I get a call its ready 30 minutes later.  Really 45 minutes for 12 needles and syringes?  The staff was not friendly, I may not switch to this to my favorite neighborhood pharmacy after all.

I came in here needing a watch battery replaced for my beloved Gucci G watch. I was a little nervous, as other merchants have broken my watches I've taken in for battery repairs in the past, but Burland exceeded my expectations.  He gave me a quick price, what type of battery would be replaced and how long.  Five minutes later, my Gucci G watch was good to go.  $8 and change later, I left ready to bring in my Burberry for my next stop here for a new battery.  This saved me considerable $$ over previous places in the mall.  Best of all its close to my neighborhood.

Their 19th St burger and fries rivals Delux and Smashburger, it's my favorite.  Virginia is my my go to waitress every time.  She sets you up with the hook up.  Fried mozzarella and potato skins as appetizers rock and they have 1/2 off happy hour specials.  Their Mac and cheese rocks as well.

Great tasting pizza with huge slices.  I'll pass on the pasta.  I've been here on the two separate occasions.  First time had the Wall Street Pizza based on suggestion from staff.  Staff is friendly and appreciative.  Pizza was delicious and slices were huge.  Didn't wait long either.  Second visit had a pasta dish with penne and meatballs.  Lots of cheese but the sauce and meatballs lacked flavor.  They also have fast carry out. I finally found my ZA takeout place.  Score!!

Top notch service, combined with superb property and location = great place to live.  I've been a resident here for two years now.  If you have a service request, it can be done online.  The response time if very prompt and if its an issue like an air conditioner or something really important they are on it asap.  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.   I had one month where my rent was going to be 3 days late and they made no big deal out of it, I paid the late fee and moved on with life.  The pricing is very competive compared to other area properties and the units have newer appliances and I've found my neighbors to be extremely friendly.  There is little noise.  My only issue is with the air conditioning units which seem to be prone to some issues, but the maintenance department is very timely helping out with requests.  They will also weatherproof your doors.  I am very happy to call Arioso home.

Be prepared for potential nasty financial surprises due to lack of follow up at this business.  I chose this office as it had consistent top of the line reviews.  My first visit here though, things started happening that sent red WARNING messages.  First visit, they did not have paperwork from my previous dentist.  I can only assume the request was done at the last minute.  Because of this, a exam and cleaning visit turned into we need to schedule another time for cleaning.  Then I was told I need periodontal scaling and root planning because it had been too long since my last cleaning (1 month longer than normal).  I was also told that I needed a crown and that it was very important to do it right away.  (Like a building was ready to implode or something)  I was not happy, this was the first time in over a decade I was told that I was told I needed scaling to be done after consistent treatment.  I also asked for some whitening trays, that I've paid about $25 for 3 in the past that do a good job, but was suggestive sold some specialized ones for over $200.00. I left the office on the first visit very apprehensive and passed on the BMW whitening trays.      Then I showed up for the periodontal  scaling/cleaning.  Better experience than long ago, but still painful.  At the end of the visit, I asked the hygienist if there was anything I could have for pain as I was sore.  I was told MOST people don't need anything, but I could use Advil.  Next day at work, I ended up leaving early because I had a headache from the dull all day soreness in my mouth.  This cost me 1 day of vacation so far between the time I took off for the appointment, and now this.   NOW the fireworks.  I get the EOB from my insurance stating that based off of previous treatment experience that they are paying for the visit as a regular perio maintenance visit, and my responsibility for this treatment is over $400.  That's over $150.00 more than what I was told.  I can only assume that a pre-treatment review was not sent in to my insurance company by the financial office of the dentist so I did not have a surprise like this.    Add in other irritations such as numerous re-schedules for appointments etc, and I'm left with not only a bitter taste in my mouth but in my wallet due to carelessness.  UNHAPPY.

Upgrading my previous review rating due to office following through on my insurance claim with an appeal that was approved.  This was only after multiple communications. Also after further reviewing items not covered by insurance, I see I was charged up front for non contracted rate, as opposed to contracted rate which applies to in network providers. Willing to give this practice another chance, but skeptical.

Best macaroni salad I've ever had and love the cooked cabbage.  I've been here twice now and have had the BBQ beef and chicken.  Love the sauce and flavor.  You get a lot of food for the money.  Meat is a little fatty, but that's what gives it great flavor and is suppose to be atypical.  Can't wait to try the chicken Katsu.

I like the original here next to La Grande Orange, but the one on Central is closer, nevertheless on this visit, there were plenty of open seating, and it was nice and cool.  I ordered a mocha, as I felt it was one of those mocha Sundays after a beer Saturday.  The mocha was the best I have ever had.  I also ordered for our table the Mozzarella and Tomatoes which was really tasty and was the perfect size appetizer.  I ordered my fave, The Autostrada, which was perfect, and the bread was crispy but not over done.  We had a bit of mishap with when it came to the check, as someone had made a mistake, however another member quickly resolved the issue without question.  That is why I return again and again to this place, also the vocal entertainment that was there also provided a great Sunday lunch experience.

Beware of the numerous up sell attempts here.  The staff aside from the actual vets are inept.  On my last visit, they tried to sell me a heart worm treatment add in even though that was covered under his wellness plan.  When I went to pick up my dog they didn't complete all the services I requested without trying to charge me extra for a rabies vaccine renewal.  After all this hot mess I reported this to the manager asking for a refund.  It was granted .  When I returned to Banfield they tried an account credit.  It's hard to not be really annoyed with them at this point.

Very thorough, I was referred here for a mole patrol last year and went here for a follow up a year after.  On my follow up 15 minutes later, I was checked head to toe and given the all clear.  No cancer, and they provided an good explanation of some hyper pygmentation on my ankles.  I'm not giving up my ankle socks, but appreciate the explanation.  From this fair skinned man, thanks Camelback Dermatology.

I love, love, love this place.  I switched from a previous office where the place always seemed to be a three ring circus.  Working together with Dr Oclair and Kate Montgomery, feels like a team.  This place is a well oiled machine!  My most recent visit with Kate Montgomery was to go over some maintenance medication concerns over health conditions she had more familariaty with, and the fact that I wanted to change, and what our next steps were.  We agreed on a change, but would do it by making sure we had the information needed to make sure the proposed choice was a good one with some additional blood tests.  She knew about the medication I wanted to switch to and provided me with well rounded information.  Unlike previous practices, this office is not change adverse, and after I explained why I wanted to change, felt we were on the same page.  This is easier said then done with most practices.  The office is a bit of a drive for me in the mornings 45 minutes which is longer than I like, but with the service received, it is so worth it.  Also unlike my previous provider, when receiving maintenance medications they provide at least 1 or 2 refills that way I'm not there additional times just to collect additional co-pays.  I feel like an empowered patient, Thanks Dr Oclair and Kate Montgomery.

Prompt, friendly, and error-free service.  This my work dress pants second home-ha!  I hate ironing/pressing my business casual pants for work, so I bring to Park Avenue.   They always have my garments ready when promised; one time they had miscounted and I had brought more than what I was charged for, and they ate the difference and did not charge me.  This is a prepaid so, no putting your clothes on holiday here.  I get discount emails from them.  My only irritation is that when you use debit they have a surcharge, but you can avoid that by paying cash.  They also have a referral program

Asthma and respiratory sufferers avoid this place like the plague.  It stinks to high heaven of cheap teen cologne.  The merchandise is still over priced and staff is dumber than a box of rocks.  On the plus side, it's a great place for decent men's sweat pants.  Just make sure you don't pay full price.  Also wash the clothes when you get them home,  they will stink like their cologne.

There is a difference between the staff working the eye exams and the retail side.  On the eye exam side, they are extremely friendly.  They even alerted me on a recall on my previous disposable contact lens brand from Cooper Vision and recommended Acuview Oasis.  I love the trial contacts, Im ready to switch to Acuview.  I was ready to sing the shops praises until I got to the retail side.  I approached one of the sales associates and her attitude switch was on.  Watch out cougar town!  I asked for pricing on Acuview and she acted like I was bothering her.  I then asked about rebates and she pointed me back to the exam side and said or you can check on the internet.  She was extremely rude.  Im not sure if I'm going to be ordering my contacts from them when I have my follow up.  I guess since I was doing over $400 in business between the contacts and the exams, they were doing me a favor?!!??  Im reporting them to my insurance company VSP.   Thumbs down.

This is my second time being here for a non profit golf fund raiser for people with spinal cord injuries, I find the staff to be quite friendly and helpful, and the grounds clean and attractive.  Staff were very accommodating to the volunteers at the event, and the golf course itself looks pristine and attractive.  The resort is a bit dated, and could use an update.  Folks with any sort of disabilities would need to dropped off at the front as parking is a bit of a walk from entrance into the main area of the resort.  All in all, I enjoy my visits here and the willingness of the resort to give back to the community.

Frequent slow/inaccurate orders.  This is not one of the better valley locations.  Metro center is the one to beat.  On my two of my three visits here, its taken nearly 20 minutes to get my order.  One of those two visits they did it incorrectly, and I had to switch the order to go as they burned up my lunch hour with their mistake.  Another to go order the dressing with my salad was watered down and it was caesar.  It ran like it was vinagerette.  I've mentioned the services issues to their manager.  First time they only apologized, never gave me reason to come back.  After three tries with this location, I'll stick with Metro center.

This was a great discovery thanks to Living Social.  I got a great deal for becoming a member so I got a $50 of merchandise for $20 net.  I was ready for discovery and am glad I ventured out.  The location is out there, but its in Kierland commons so its worth the drive.  The store is very clean but doesnt have that overly clean hospital feeling.  It also does not stink like some of these line of stores do where there is so much smell where you feel like you have to wipe it from your clothes.  The sales associate was very helpful and friendly but not clingy.  I had my list of items I found from the website and they carried them all.  The items I did smell were wonderful, everything smelled real and not full of chemicals.  I stopped before I did too much damage to my wallet and asked for some shampoo and conditioner samples.  It was not a problem, the sales associate was more than willing and put me on the mailing list for coupons.  I purchased avocado mint hair repair which looks wonderful, the ten minute brightening mask with glycolic acid, the almond shave creme and muscle ease.  All products use natural ingredients and the other thing I noticed is the containers are not overly flashy.  The product says it and no pictures are needed.  I can't wait to come back and try the mint hair wash and conditioning creme.

Wonderfully helpful staff.  I came looking for a mirror and found a mirror and then some!  If the store does not have the item you are looking for in stock, they will check other stores within the valley before sending you out and about.  I also found a print that ended up being that last one in the store, so they gave me an additional 20% as clearance discount.  The mirror was too large to walk out to the car so they helped me once I brought the car to the loading area.  Staff is not pushy, and does not push their credit card down your throat.  They will advise you of any promotions however for having their card. Merchandise goes through periods of hot and cold due to buyers, but when it's hot it is hot.  Check this place out.

A comedy of errors is the best description for our experience last night.  Our appetizer the mozzarella was over cooked and was more like potato chips, the bread was in short supply and took forever.  Our entrees took over an hour to arrive on our table.  To top it off, the waitress, didn't listen on how we wanted to split our bill and one of our party had to walk to her to coach her on how we wanted the check split.  Nothing hard either, split the bill, apply my $20 giftcard to my portion and bill me the balance.  While I don't blame the waitress for the slow service due to short staffing, I'm glad I don't come often.  Now I understand why.  For the money, there are plenty of other Italian choices.  Enough said.

The service and food was wonderful with one exception.  When we walked in on this last Sunday night and stated that we had a reservation, our hostess was about to seat us when another couple walked in and she dropped us to assist them and brought them to the dining room.  Then she tried to place us in a private booth with curtains.  So Im not sure if she thought my friend and I were a couple.  She made it apparent who she thought deserved priority without explanation.  At that point my friend, another male told her we needed to be seated elsewhere and it was not "date night"  and she found us a different area.  Bad first impression.  Once upon being seated however, everything was as smooth as could be, drinks were great, food was great and service was wonderful.  I'm glad the waitress over came the bad first impression the hostess created when we first got there.

This is your place for no-nonense helpful and friendly service.  I called a couple of days ago inquiring on a new Reebok shoe as my main brand PUMA has not come out with any new appealing running shoes.  Looked at the SA website and they had a pair of red and black Reebocks.  These looked sharp and were part of their my flex line.  I've never worn Reebocks before so I called this store to see if they had this style in the color and size I wanted.  They had just gotten them shipped so they were not on the floor but in the back.  The associate from the shoe department took the time to check to see if they had my size.  They did and he told me to allow 2 days to come in and get them so they could get them unloaded from the freigh truck.  I came in yesterday asked about them and they went to the back and got them for me with a smile.  The shoes fit great and were very breathable which is a plus in Phoenix especially this time of year.  I also found a red pair of underarmour shorts and asked at checkout if I could use both of my 20% off coupons as both items were not at Camelback store and they said yes.  The experience here is so simple and no-nonsense. I left very happy, very sporty and soon very red.

Great sales on mens high end jeans.  Pick up their frequent guest card, and they extend additional percentages off of sale prics.   This is my favorite place to pick up mens Buffalo Jeans at excellent prices.  Normally they are $100-$130 but coordinate with their sales and you can pick up a pair for $55.

Slow service, did not keep me in the loop.  I showed up for my 1030 apt time on Saturday for oil change, filter, inspection and tire balance and rotation.  It took 3 hours and then I had to confront the service advisor regarding the terribly slow service.  He apologized twice but did nothing else.  I then showed up home to find out they didn't rotate the tires.  Worst of all they didn't bother to explain why.  Tempe Acura, I won't be back, I knew there was a reason I didn't buy my Acura from there either.

This was a terrible experience.  I am a regular Target shopper and was returning three small items that were less than $5 total.  Two of the items were not coming up on their computer but were clearly showing on my receipt for $105.  The two service associates acted helpless dumbfounded and definitely not empowered.  They continuously asked me if i had another receipt.  After I screamed at them that it was ridiculous to put me through this for $2, they gave me a cash refund-for less than I paid.  I am still annoyed, I can't believe retail has sunken to this level of stupidity.

My second visit to this place won me over--at least on the lunch menu.  The wok fired Mongolian Beef was soooo good.  The beef strips were thicker than the usual paper crap you find at other places and they give you the rice on the side which is perfect if you are trying to watch carbs a bit.  They also extend choice of brown or white rice.  Staff are friendly enough, not really memorable.  The shrimp appetizer was really good also and when I paid with a gift card the waitress was not confused like at some other places.  Food also arrived at a good time after the appetizer, I get really annoyed when everything comes up all at once.  Now if they had a location closer to central phoenix like along Cameback road, it would be perfect.

This is my favorite venue for entertainment.  I went to Maragaret Cho here and all of the seating is very good no matter where you are at.  We paid for a higher price point ticket which was at about row 19 towards the center section.  Staff are friendly, the vendors prices are  a bit ridiculous,so passed on any libations and got some afterwards.  I won't fault the Dodge for this directly but the vendors contracted.  Crowds also tend to behave not as trashy as at US Airways or Cricket pavillon which is a plus

I write this review as I was actually accosted at this bar.  I was with a friend during a Phur fest event/weekend/whatever.  It was super busy and the bar was providing free food which I thought was cool, except for I didn't stand in anyone's way as it seemed like a competitive line to get there.  Drinks seemed spendy too considering they were in white trash plastic ware.  We were outside and someone mentioned a pool party the next day for $35 and I stated that I thought it was a rip off and asked what do you actually get for that amount. Apparently someone was eavesdropping and got in my face for expressing my opinion.  Then he proceeded to tell my friend it was $30 not $35.  I said PUHLEAZ.  He then got in my face and said what did you say?  I said please, and then he said please what, I said that's it I said please.  I actually thought he was tweeked out, or something as the drama was ridiculous.  He then comes back to me in about 10 minutes apologizing, stating I was entitled to my opinion; his BF is in the hospital for something.  I said that's cool no worries and thought if it went down you would be going DOWN on the ground.  I left thinking if your partner/significant other is in the hospital, why are you at a bar creating drama and if this is what your patrons are like; then I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.

I actually met Dr Durisek as a neighbor after moving to the valley 9 years ago.  Once I had dental insurance I had to check out the practice after a painful visit to another facility through a dental HMO.  What can I say, I've never left--very comfortable setting, Teresa is wonderful, and I never feel pressured into upsells, such as cosmetic procedures, etc.  I'm given the information needed to make the decision and treated like an informed patient.  I've also never left the office with a bad experience ever.  Pretty rare to say about a business after 9 years- so I'm sure I'll be a patient here as long as I stay in the valley.

The business office follow up and insurance claims handling has become terrible here over the past year.  I've been going to this office for years and I guess its time to move on; there have been some staff changes in the business office and they seem disinterested and disengaged in patient handling at best.  This started when I switched insurance about a year ago.  The new insurance denied a peridontal maintenance routine cleaning claim, stating they needed a diagnosis/history in order to re-review.  I received a call from Open Wide staff asking me to contact my previous dentist from over ten years ago for treatment history.  When I asked why, they stated they lost my records due to a digital conversion.  Sounds a little scary, where did the information go?  I never got an answer on that.  After about 3 months, some gray hairs, I finally wrote my insurance asking for an appeal on the claim, after determining Open Wide staff did not follow up requesting it.   Then the staff contacted me saying they only were able to get the insurance to approve two cleanings a year paid,  funny enough a week later, I received an appeal approval letter from the insurance stating they would again pay for periodontal maintenance.  Dissappointing that I had to put in the energy to do the office work they should be doing after many years being a patient.  Final straw was today, I had another claim earlier this year that was denied after a recommended procedure was done.  I was told that the insurance should cover 50% after previous experience with occlusal adjustments.  This was after repeated attempts to try to sell me Invislign at quite an overpriced rate that I declined.  After contacting the office a fourth time both in person and on phone, I was told the claim resubmission was denied again even after they attached a narrative to the claim.  A narrative?  Is this story time?  This was after it took them over 5 months to resubmit the previous claim with little to no follow up.   I guess after many attempts of keeping this patient relationship going, its best to move on.  Patients that utilize dental insurance, beware.

Nothing but impressed!  Staff is warm friendly and no nonsense.  They even said I have nice teeth.  It's been years since a dentist has said that.  In the past it's always up sell up sell.  Not here, we did a perio cleaning and they were upfront and gave me lots of information.  Loved it, I walked out feeling that both the office staff has my best health interest at heart and that they want to get to know me as a person.  Loved the location!

My favorite breakfast stop in central Phoenix.  The pancakes are huge, the coffee is smooth and flavorful.  Service is friendly and your food is out super quick.  My breakfast faves are the various omelette sand scrambles, but my sinful guilty pleasure there is The Monte Christo.  Ask for extra preserves/jelly as it gives a great contrast in flavor.  It's probably the best Monte Christo I've ever had.

This was my first visit here and it felt like a neighborhood Italian pizzeria.  The staff is very friendly and well the best part the pizza was wonderful.  The crust was thin and the meats on the pizza were very flavorful.  I think we had ordered the meat lovers, and it had the perfect amount of sauce.  The order came out very quickly and the waiter was very attentive and even threw in a bit of cheesy humor for measure.  Parking might need some help, as it looks sparse, but I think its building specific.  I would love to come here again.

Slow service.  Now I know why I do my financial service business with banks and not credit unions.  You may have lower rates on loans and other lending products but you pay with reduced service.  I received a mailer in the mail to refinance my auto loan at a reduced interest rate.  I've called the phone number instructed and was told by member services to leave a name and number for a call back from a loan officer.  I've called so far two days ago with no return call and then followed up today with another call to only be told that due to overwhelming response to leave my name and phone number.  As a bank employee that is also a share holder, I probably will leave my business at the bank.

I'm a fan.  I set up an appointment for installation of some Pirelli tires to replace some BF Goodrich tires that were driving me nuts as they were showing cupping wear.  I set up the appointment for 10 am.  They greeted me fairly quickly and before I knew it they were done at 1040am and I was on my way.  I'm totally thrilled with the service, I got the replacement certificates and was driving on the road and there was little roar and they handle great.  Discount seemed to be a bit more expensive but they have won me over.

I was not happy with my most recent visit to dr douglas cunningham.  I went in to get a mail order prescription refill.  I was then told i was getting a physical.  I was not told how long it would be.  I was not asked if this would work for me today.  There was no consideration for me the patient.  I had another appointment scheduled 75 minutes after this one.  After being in the office being poked and prodded 70 minutes later i was told i had bloodwork and a shot still.  Ridiculous.  I asked if i could come back after lunch as i was late for a lunch appt.  I was told no.  Total time at pueblo family physicians 1 hour 45 minutes.  Unacceptable, my time is valuable and the office staff did not respect it.  I'm beginning my search for a new pcp.

This place brings back memories of going to my local midwest podunk steakhouse.  The decor is hideous but in a good way, the salad bar has Bacos, I didn't even know they still existed, but I loved them as a kid.  The bread they serve tastes freshly baked and the staff is relaxed, low key and friendly.  Prime rib is very tasty and incredibly reasonably priced.  The chicken fried steak somethin sometin is very good as well.  This is comfort food at its finest.  I think they may be a bit generous on the salt and butter, but leave your guilt at the door and get your fork and knife ready.

Love this place, the service is on it.  They seat you and already have gotten your drink order started at the same time.  The atmosphere is quiet, and doesn't have the roar or move em in move em in out feeling like some places.  The food is of great quality, comes out incredibly fast and hot and not greasy, and best of all with service they act as a cohesive team.  The wait staff help each other, and also service taking care of payments, its just nice how this place runs like a well oiled machine.    Their omeletes are great and the potatoes, are made just like my german grandmother use to make.  Yum.

Nothing to see here folks--The food was not bad, the ingredients were fine but no flavor that leaves you with a za za zoom.  I ordered a chicken sandwich with onion rings and a soda.  $2.50 for a soda?  The total for this lunch was $15.  Now I remember why I don't come here for lunch, for the money, there are a lot better choices.  The upbeat music does not account for the $4 difference between this place and many others.  Service was friendly, but I don't think I'll be back.. anytime soon or until I forget why I stopped in the first place.

I love this place-probably the best Greek food in town and its evidenced by how busy it always is.  The family knows their customers, they have my favorite items memorized and if I get an order to go for lunch at work, they are fast and very friendly.  Very very tasty, and even better that its not a commericialized place, their advertising is stricly word of mouth.  This is a small business restaurant run very well.

Nordstroms is the capital of retail service.  I first visited on Veteran's day as I was looking for a Stephen Webster ring I found on the Neimas Marcus website and figured I would try Nordstrom and see if they had any comparable man jewelry.  I ended up strolling past the Emporio Armani watches and found a lonely one that was screaming for me to take another look.  BTW-It was packed this particular in this department.  I really liked the watch but extended the minimum 24 hour wait to see if you really want it rule.  The sales associate kindly gave me the style, and price information for reference.  After 48 hours I decided I really wanted it and Stephen Webster would have to wait.  I went in and first thing, the sales associate in the department complimented my shoes.  Ok, hook was definitely sunk in.  She said that was the first thing she noticed, and then complimented the watch and it's unique styling.  I really felt the spotlight was on me the customer as it wasn't the usually schmooping you get at the Target check out.  She boxed it up, asked me where I got my shoes and I was on my way, watch in tow.  Normally, I look for friends and family sales for Armani watches at Macy's but they did not have this style.  Thanks Nordstrom, for helping me with my touch of distinct and unique style.

Nordstrom razzle dazzle boom, your customer service sends me sailing away on a Mediterranean dream seas.  I purchased an Armani watch over a year ago.  I kept the receipt, I know, smart right?  Well to my dismay the movement died on it.  Fast fix wanted to charge $65 and so I thought I would give it a shot to return it for store credit.  The mens watch service associate without hesitation offered to send it for warranty repair service since they didn't carry the model anymore.  I was tickled beyond belief.  She explained the wait time, and best of all no charge.  Thanks Nordstrom, you did it again.

The wonderful thing about this school is flexibility!  I originally signed up for the weekend program but found out on my first day of classes that I could go to weekday classes as well and that I was not locked in for weekends specifically.  You are also given six months to complete the program so it gives you time to go at your own speed.  Location is convenient  in Scottsdale.  Instructors keep the material fun.  Downside is the class period length--4.5 hours.  There are breaks, but still that is long time to go over material.  One of those hours is for previous material review from the day before.  Great if you were there the day before, not so applicable if you were not there.  Great school for aspiring real estate professionals.

My friend and I showed up for Easter brunch only to be turned away.  They just said we have no openings, did not say when next available time would be.  Disgusting regard for customers,  I've never felt so insulted.

I always enjoy my visits to PF Changs.  The quality of the food is consistently good and flavorful, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is very tasteful.  Every time I come in you can see guests laughing and smiling so you know the enjoyability of the restaurant is contagious.  The staff is always very pleasant and accomodating and informative if you have any questions.  A bonus is that they issue out a 10% off discount card that I received after a visit in downtown San Jose, CA.  How can it get any better?

Best clearance sales when coordinated with a Dillard's card.  Scored on 2 Perry Ellis polos, a Hugo Boss T shirt, two pairs of Calvin Klein trunks, Hugo Boss swimming suit for $118.00.  Cha-Ching!  Sales staff is helpful and relaxed, only annoying thing is sometimes the dressing rooms are trashed out with mounds of clothing laying everywhere.

Needless Markup was always my term of humor for this store, but after my experience I had with them on last friday, I must say I walked out of this store completely impressed.  I was looking for a replacement lapis bead bracelet as I had purchased a Scott Kay one from Saks.com and it broke at the San Jose Airport of course right before boarding the stupid plane.  After not being able to resolve the issue to my satisfaction with Saks I decided to look else where.  I stopped at Neimans because I had seen some before but only one lapis one.  To my surprise they had one and it was a King Baby.  I had seen one there before but it had one of those stupid day of the dead skulls on it.  Not this time!  The beads were larger than my Scott Kay one and it didnt have a clumsy clasp.  The price was extra nice at the same price of the Scott Kay one and the Neimans sales rep took accountability stating that if I had any problems with it whatsoever I could deal with him personally to resolve the issue.  I love companies that encourage employee empowerment!  While I may not purchase any of Neimans clothes due to the prices outside of my price point, I will surely stop at the mens jewelry area in the future.  Service here deserves a definite wow!

Great lunch stop in Tempe.  Huge sandwiches with flavorful ingredients and a variety of side choices.  This place evens has multigrain bread options.  I have had two different turkey variety sandwiches and both were bursting with flavor.  Service is quick,.  My sandwich was so stacked that I couldn't eat my chipotle coleslaw side.  That's saved for later.  Dolly's is a great big sandwich chain alternative at a competitive price.  Stop here, it's nice.

Thanks to the wondeful folks at Groupon tried Caffe Boa.  I had to say I am eager to return.  The decor and atmospher is very cosmo and open, there are plenty of intimate tables and those for larger groups.  Our waiter was very friendly and we received our drinks within a short period of time.  We were also seated fairly quickly.  The appetizer caesar salad was ok, the bread with sauce was much better.  I liked the basket approach.  I ordered their version of the fried chicken which had a bean salad type side dish.  Very very good.  I look forward to trying the brunch, I wish they had a location in Central Phoenix.  The music was also very urban.  I thought this was a great date dinner setting.   Thanks Caffe Boa

I've been here a couple of times now.  I love the seating in here, even in the 300 section I had a good view of the Giants vs the Diamondbacks.  You can also bring in your own bottled water and snacks.  For those trying to save a few bucks, they offer value beer which is coors light or bud light on tap and other value concession items.  For two of us, I think we spent $30 on concessions after 5 beers and a diamondbacks dog.  Only thing is that its a bit of a cluster..uck when trying to leave.

Oh no!  Me thinks not.  Food is bland and lacks creativity.  Service is also not attentive either.  I received a soda refill with a hole in the glass which I discovered a stream forming on the table.  The waitress didn't understand leaking glass so I had to explain HOLE in glass.  I received another soda but the stream was still alive and well.  She did not come back to soak up the spill.   Our plates were surfing Baja style.  Ten minutes later,  gut bomb has been set off.  They may have an extensive menu, but I would pass even on the table of contents.

This is my favorite burger joint as Delux has the best burgers for taste.  I've never had a problem with the food here, only thing I find strange at times is sometimes the wait staff has a bit of an attitude, which is funny considering it's a burger place.  I know it's in the Biltmore-arcadia area but la de da.  This last visit was funny as I saw some parents bring a bunch of children here.  This does not seem like the type of place to bring your child, totally odd, but whatever rocks your boat.

Ice cream and yogurt--step aside and exit please.  This place is tops in my book.  Their are tons of flavors to choose from, you can also take in some samples and they have a flavor of the month.  Seating indoors is a little limited but when the weather is decent plenty of spots outside to people watch and check out eye candy.  This is perfect way to skip the dessert at whatever restaurant you are at, and get one much more flavorful and worth the price.  My favorite flavors to date are the Roche and the Vanilla bean, perfect contrast.  Staff is friendly and the music is kind of loungy.  I've also Gelato from other spots and it is no match, this is the most creamiest, flavorful gelato I've had to date.

I always have a great time at Fez.  Sunday night was 50% off of all bottles of wine and we had an excellent bottle of Hob Nob Pinot Noir.  Service was friendly, atomosphere is always an interesting mix and my order the Lamb Kisra was good as always.  The food was out to our table really fast.  You can't miss with Fez, I think it's time for the pomegranite chicken again next time.

Slow service--I've noticed this the last couple of visits to FEZ.  It took over 10 minutes to get acknowledged by a waiter after being seated and then another 10 minutes to receive our cocktails.  I actually thought about getting up and walking out as they were not busy at all.  Food came out fairly quickly and was consistent, no surprises or much of any new trends developing here.  After our food again, it took foreever to get a water refill and a second beer only after we flagged the waiter down.  For some reason though, he was quick to come around and ask if we were interested in desert.  Maybe he likes offering dessert?  It then took forever to get our tab to leave and only after we waved down the water.  The slow service has been noticeable the last couple of visits.  This leads me to believe either there is a staffing shortage or a lack of attentiveness amongst the wait staff.  I've noticed there was plenty of time for chit chat amongst the staff so I have to defer to my second assumption.  I thought it was just me that noticed this, but my friend who was with me from out of the country noticed the marked difference since the last time I took him here.  Slow service is going to show up in reduced gratuity, and eventually different restaurant choices as there are plenty in this price point.  FEZ management take notice, before you continue down the slope of mediocrity.

Slow service and 15-20 for mediocre philly cheese steaks.  Sandwiches and fries do not have a lot of flavor.  Also the televisions are blaring loud, if you have sensitive hearing beware.  Seating is limited.

I was here for Wednesday lunch using my handy groupon that I purchased recently.  The waiter was pleasant, and recognized I was busy checking voicemails and emails and didn't engage me in needless chit chat.  I ordered a couple of beers and the New York Strip with a ceasar side salad.  The steak was cooked perfectly to my liking and had a tasty sauce on top of it.  The carrots were cooked just right not too mushy or crunchy.  I wish Ticoz would restore some of the pricier items back to the menu as this like others are their crown jewel.

Men's Watches and Jewelry Department.  I stopped here to see if they had the Emporio Armani watch that I liked and had seen in Fashion Square.  They sure did and I was glad I stopped.  Luxury watch fanatics take note. The friends and family discount is the only one that can be used for certain watches, including Emporio.  The sales assistant was wonderful and even sold me on the extended service plan.  The plan even includes lifetime battery replacement.  I have about 5 armanis and when the watch batteries die, its at least 20-50 smackers per pop.  The $19.99 service agreement was a deal!  I hardly ever buy them.  To top off this wonderful service sundae, she even removed the links on the watch.  This was something they did not do in the past.  Lastly, she asked me to send my friends her way.  I loved that.  Not many businesses ask you to refer them to your friends for additional business.  Even though I'm no fan of Donald Trump, Macy's you are my number one department store! Thanks!

I love this place, it evolves in simple elegant ways.  It's been a little more than a year since I've last been there.  I booked the reservation on line and was able to get a reservation 45 minutes earlier than quoted by phone.  On-line is where its at.  New addition since I've been there a cosmo dj spinning some old school tunes.  Love it, love it.  Took the parents, they are a little afraid of change but they give this a passing grade the last time we were here.  The sangria is very tasty and got two pitchers.  Order the lamb meatballs; pass on them, they need more flavor.  The stuffed dates are a sure hit though.  Entrees were pork tenderloin and chicken.  These were all perfect and flavorful.   Wait staff is perfect.  I finished off with the Hazelnut pudding.  The pudding was great, the pastry that was on the side, had mystery flavors that I would pass on.  I wish there was a location arond the Biltmore area.  Fox restaurants this place is a hit!

It has been quite a while since I've been to Harley's Italian Bistro.  Tonight we went and had one of the bread appetizers.  It was quite good and then my friend ordered the ravioli and I tried a chicken entree with pesto.  Mine was quite wonderful, but the rule I find at Harley's is that not to finish your meal, have about half and take the other with you as the cuisine ends up being a bit rich on the digestive system.  Our waiter was polite, in fact almost old world, old school polite, it was so sweet.  Thanks Pablo.  The food was great, came out relatively fast, service was attentive and it's a relaxing environment.  When I'm craving Italian, I'll be sure to drop by more often.

Wonderful place for dogs, my dog has never looked so cute and wonderful smelling.  The groomers are meticulous and have a great sense of humor!  I took my mini Aussie for a groom and they spent the time to make him just how I wanted him to appear.  They did try to sell me on their pet foods but were not too pushy.  I thought the pricing on the foods was astronomical.  The toys though were great and perfect for chewers like mine.  I ended our visit with my pup smelling like candy, a new toy and pet friendly chocolate cookie for him, and a smile on my face.  Staff is friendly and I didn't feel like the number I do at the big box places.  I also saved $20 on my groom versus Petsmart.  Thanks Wag N Wash

Best banana walnut pancakes in the valley.  They even serve the syrup on the side nice and warm to melt the fresh butter.  Tuna salad sandwich is also on my top five sandwiches.  Friendly staff, free wifi and plug ins for your laptop.  Could it be any better?

This was my second  visit and I got to take two of my newbies to the place.  We were seated promptly indoors, and the staff was very friendly.  I ordered a blood orange mojito and it was excellent and quite large-just the way a cocktail should be.  I ordered the chicken which was excellent and the two sides I had were the stuffing and beans.  It was sooo good.  We felt no pressure in turning over the table as they do in some restaurants.  I tried my friends mashed potatoes and they were so good.  He cleaned his plate and raved about it and he eats like a bird so I know he like it.  Can't wait to try a new selection and for the next Groupon.

I might give it one more try.  The service was fast, the sandwich was relatively good but could have been more flavorable considering the price point of this restaurant.  Then came the food with a bag of plain lays Potato chips.  I think Subway offer more flavor for less money.  On the upside the coleslaw had an interesting twist with the feta cheese.  They could have cut it up better, looked like a shake out of the bag job.  Don't go out of your way to eat here.

Food is great, love it love it love it.  The Philla Steak Pita, the hummus, the mediterranean chicken salad, gotta love it.  Wait staff on the male side is total eye candy, however, can't say I'm impressed by being called dude.  My waiter need some listening skills as he forgot my soda until I reminded him for the 2nd time.  Maybe cuz it was cuz he was giving elevator eyes to customers and staff.  Would give this place more but think the male wait staff needs to come down to earth a bit so we can at least have a decent conversation....dude.

Unfriendly dog park.  There are women here that think it's their private dog park and have no problem telling you if they think you should leave.  My dog is 1.5 years old and a mini Aussie shepherd.   He gets a little excitable but is a friendly dog.  He went to get a drink and a couple other dogs approached him and he barked at them trying to protect himself to tell them they needed to back off.  Some woman with six dogs walks up to me telling me my dog needs to leave because he's causing fights.  Drama queen.  I took him and left.  When I got him, found that he had gotten bitten by the other dogs when getting a drink  Nasty nasty park.  I've taken him to numerous other public places and have never gotten that kind of feed back.  If you dare take your dogs here but make sure to get your shots with Parvo going around in the valley.

This is a writeup on the pharmacy department.  I called in early this morning around 10am to transfer a prescription.  I told the associate that I would be in around 3pm once she asked to pick it up.  I arrived today around 3pm.  I was told it would be twenty minutes.  Here starts the irritation.  I was on my hour lunch so I figured no biggie, I can grab lunch and bring it back to work.  It's now 345 and I'm told its finally ready.  This was not a big chemical mixture to work up either.  It's not alchemy 101.  It's for eye allergy drops.  What a concept, wrap the label around the box, bill my insurance drop in bag.  I present one of Fry's notorious $25 in free grocery coupons for transfering a prescription.  The pharmacy tech states that I can't use it.  I lose it at this point and ask why not.  She then reviews the coupon and starts looking through their book.  I looked at her and the pharmacist and simply state annoyingly "It helps in these situations to read first before saying no."  The tech after scanning the $25 in free grocery credit asks me to pay and I ask her that I would like to know how much I owe before I pay.  She then told me the total.  I paid and walked away wondering how a pharmacy could staff such people.  Terrible.  I will not be coming here again anytime soon.  BTW-Fry's, I'll be transferring this script back to Target.  Time for service classes for your staff.

Great fun dive bar. I was there for Bearacudda and it was tons of fun.  Staff is friendly, crowd is friendly and they also have decent drag shows.  They do accept credit cards and have a juke box.  Bathrooms are small so during busy evenings with lots of peeps, you will be in line and your kidneys will float.  Karaoke night is kind of lame though seemed like same old folks there specifically for karaoke.

Great place for high quality Midwest Beef.  It is expensive though and more than what you would pay in a grocery store .  However, there are Groupons available, and a monthly newsletter with specials listed.  Service is attentive.  My faves are the hangar steak and petite sirloin.  Both are reasonably priced.  I don't see a lot of bone in meats here which are my favorite as they seem to be more flavorful.  Small town feel here, I've been here multiple times.

Non transparent in pricing.  I'll get to that soon.  That being said, staff is friendly and very professional and try to make you feel home.  Office is nice and cozy.  When I finished with my periodontal cleaning and exam, they gave me a treatment estimate sheet.  They wanted to switch out six silver fillings and do a crown for $2500.  They even showed me what my insurance would pay.  What they didn't bother to disclose until I pressed them on it was that they were not in my insurances network.  Ummm shady.  That should have been disclosed.  I have a PPO.  If that would have been a bank people would be screaming about non transparency.  Furthermore, I understand why you want to replace amalgam silver fillings.  I'm informed but it doesn't need to be done TODAY.  My portion after insurance was  going to be a whopping $1500.  I don't think so.    Moving along, my quest for a replacement dentist starts again.  NEXT.

I would state this first time visit as one of mixed feelings.  I called on Monday stating I would be needing to set up a time for a first time haircut on Saturday.  I left a voice mail and did not receive a return phone call until Wednesday.  Considering I was telling them I was interested in giving them new business you would think they would be on it with geting me scheduled.  I could have changed my mind by Wednesday.  I scheduled a time on Saturday and the stylist was about fifteen minutes behind.  He then informed me he needed to clean his station first, which took another 10 minutes, so the first impressions were not off to a good note.  He washed my hair first prior to the cut, which was a first for me that I still don't know if i cared for and didn't spend much time on my hair.  When finished I still had clippings on my face that I wiped with my wrist/hand.  Hmm.  I didn't feel very welcome here, so I think I'm still going to keep looking for a replacement for my previous stylist that I divorced myself from.  On a good note, so far I like the cut, it just seems the service is a big rough around the edges.  Maybe I'm expecting too much for a $35 mens cut.

Great Chicago style pizza.  They are odd with their systems.  Yes, explanation coming.  I ordered using a groupon and did it through the website as I thought it would be easiest.  Of course after ordering using the Groupon, the instructions said to call the order in.  Go figure.  I arrived and at first they were not going to take the Groupon because I did not call the order in.  I was told it was something to do with their systems.  Pretty funny and ridiculous, I was about to tell them if that was needed, to cancel the web order, and I could stand there and call in same on the phone so it wouldn't be an issue with the Groupon.  Some of these businesses are so funny how they sound when they say this drivel.  I stood my ground and said that if they would not honor the groupon to cancel the order.  DOH.  They worked their magic, made me pay the sales tax and I was on my way.  I got home and the pizza was true Chicago style, real tomatoes none of that pressed stuff, and the ingredients were fresh, the peppers had that tiny bit of crunch you crave along with the homemade sausge.  I think i got the fantastic four or something...sausge, peppers, onions, whatever.  It was very good.  For takeout, dominoes step to the side, that is if I'm not too lazy to get in the car to pick it up.

Bueller, Ferris, where's the flavor.  Absent.  I had an expiring groupon for Fatburger and decided to get a to go order for work lunch.  Staff service is ok, but they had the order set up for to eat there. No biggy.   We got our order quickly and had ordered the medium fat burger.  I got the onion rings and my co-worker got the fries.  I could not taste any flavor from the burger, and the bacon had that crispy leaning on the side of burned taste.   The onion rings tasted like the onions were fresh, but still the taste was lacking.   Fatburger, I'll pass.  This place is one where I will keep driving past and not stop again.

Fantastic place, with relaxing healing atmosphere.  I purchased a groupon here for some massages and I'm glad I did.  I divorced my previous spa and after using up my groupon i think I may doing a prepaid option.  Yes, they have prepaid specials here so you can save some $$.  Staff is wonderful, my massage therapist has been administering trigger point and doesn't upsell me for it.  I appreciate it in the age of never ending upsell.  She also gives me after massage tips and is not afraid to apply some good pressure.  This is an issue for us males, who encounter therapists afraid of pressure.  I left sore after my first massage, but it was a good sore, and in combination with my physical therapist, I'm making slow but sure progress on my injury.  Proformance is my first stop for my massage needs.

Rude staff.  I've been a patient here for years and was really satisfied until an interaction with the receptionist on this last Saturday.  I contacted to reschedule an appointment due a personal emergency for an appointment that was about 4 hours later in the afternoon.  Without letting me speak anymore she stated that I needed to pay a $25 cancel fee to the therapist.  After stating that I was a patient there for a number of years and that the fee was never disclosed, she went so far as to attempt to collect my credit card number to try and charge it.  I told her that I've been going here for years and since she was insistent, the business was going to lose about $1000 in yearly massage revenue, and that I wouldn't be coming any more.  She stated "Wow."  The phone line went dead.  I called the business the next day and asked for a business manager to follow up with me.  It hasn't happened.  I hate bad break ups.

Everything was great for my massage appointment, facility is clean, room is clean and the therapist was great, until the end.  UGH.  After I finished my massage with Tanner, he stated I will meet you at front to check out.  I reached the desk and paid for the visit with another staff member.  Tanner started talking to anther employee or third party and would not acknowledge me when I was trying to give gratuity.  I sat, crickets were chirping, even the employee that took my payment is looking at him, finally he had to tap him on the shoulder to get him to quit talking with his co-employee so I could give him gratuity.  I was embarrassed for him.  It really blew my first impression negatively.  Not sure if Ill be back.

Good service recovery.  These are a defining moment for any business.  Booked another massage after the owner offered a comp after a subpar experience with a former staff member.  Jason was great.  He had a mastery in hot stone techniques and to top it off in the end provided some information on new oils/lotions he used.  To top it off he stayed engaged from beginning to end.  I now have a close place to go to for my massages.  Thanks Chris and Tangible.  Count me impressed! I'll see you again soon.

This is for the Starbucks inside Safeway.  These people are my favorite Starbucks folks.  They have my drink memorized and I"m not a daily addict either!  They are fast with service and my drink is perfect. Mysterious is great and makes you feel like family.  I also like the periodic surveys where if I do them my next tall Peppermint Mocha is on the house.  Gotta Love it.

Don't do it!  My friend and I went there this evening for dinner as it had been a while.   Our drinks arrived fairly quickly as did our appetizer.  The drinks were ok, quality of liquor used was lower end.  Our entrees which were both cold sandwiches and seemed to take quite a while, which seemed odd.  We then passed on dessert.  This is where it went south.  We paid our bill and as my friend and I walked to my car, our waiter Scott accosted us asking if there was a problem with the service.  Keep in mind we left a 15% tip.  I'm not sure what his problem was, but we were in shock. We told him that we left his tip on the table and he walked away without an apology.  How unprofessional--either possibility if he thought we didn't leave enough, then he had a major attitude problem.  If he thought we didn't leave anything, then he was a total wad and physically blind.  Unprofessional service and mediocre food means no repeat visits.  I'm really surprised at the service received at some restaurants during this recession.  I've not received any replies to my reporting of the incident to Switch management via email on their website.

I can't help but being annoyed when I walk I here.  The place screams duck dynasty.  I walked in looking for Ouzo, took forever to find it as their signage is bad then when I finally found it I asked if they only had two brands.  The employee confirmed they only had two and both were the highest priced.  I then went to Total wine saw four brands and one that was excellently rated at half the price at Bevmo.  Sorry Bevmo I say Bev NO.

Target your pharmacy staff needs some serious help.  My healthcare provider wrote a script for a medication that was an injectable, some needles, and a syringe.   Nevertheless, when I picked up the medication the syringe was on order and you could not find my order for needles.  Then when I go to get my injection, I find out that the pharmacy staff was arguing with my doctors office on the size of needles needed.  Who is my health care provider?  Ugh, I should have taken this particular script to CVS or someplace that does not have a 4 tech to 1 actual pharmacist ratio.  All for that $10 giftcard coupon.  Now I'm not sure if that free bottle of Cheer was worth it for all this hassle.  I guess maybe if my clothes stay colorful and bright I can laugh about this.  Remind me next time Target I will only bring you prescriptions with monosyllabic words.  Shish.

Perfect Greek quick food place.   Staff is very friendly and portions are quite large for the money.  My only detractor is that the gyro meat needs a bit more flavor, but then again, maybe I just need to add tzatziki sauce.  They also offer various Greek desserts which is not typical for most Greek quick food

From reading previous reviews, times have changed.  The jockstrap has evolved since previous reviews.  This sports authority is #1 source of sporting goods.  Check out the Under Armour athletic apparel in the mens section, as they have mens trunk underwear that will keep the jingle in your jangle and is as described.  I've purchased a couple and its evolutionary.  Like any retail store, when it comes to pricing you have to be proactive.  To get a break, I check out the Wednesday flier that's in with the junk mail or sunday inserts.  Usually you can find some good incentives.  Also if you take a couple of minutes to do their invitation online survey you get $10 off of $50.  That's 20% and if you are willing to succumb your online privacy and give them your email, they will notify you of employee friends and family promotions at 25% off.  I used it to purchase a $399 Diamondback that I ended up getting for $200 after a sale.  Staff are friendly if you ask and if they don't have a size will do a check to see if another location carries what you are looking for.  I'm wondering where their Puma selection is as I would consider that to be just as popular as addidas.  Due to the location it's my first sports stop, and even though I remember Albertsons, the last thing I'll be thinking about when I'm there is cottage cheese.

This is my first choice in Sports Authority stores in the valley.  I've had great service, in fact staff has helped me look up items too if they are available at other stores.  They need more Asic shoes selection, heavy on Nike throughout the store. They have a great rewards program, 5% rewards on your purchases.  Ready, set go!

I enjoy going to both crate and barrel stores in the Valley,  This one is great if you want to compare against Pottery Barn,  which I find there is no comparison.  The designs are superb, timely, and the staff is friendly and full of personality.  While my budget has not afforded furniture pieces to date, I have purchased many accessories and art pieces, etc.  I found a blue Polish Misa vase on sale for $24.95 which was over 50% off.  Wonderful piece and very sturdy.  Also found a mirror for the bedroom-very contemporary and I'm sure it will fit my decor for many years.  Plus I told the staff how much I love their merchandise and they offered me a job application.  I look forward to many additional purchases at this store and hope I can soon start purchasing furtiture pieces.

Although on my last visit I did not purchase anything, I had a nice suprise.  I saw the manager who assisted me with a bedroom furniture purchase I did almost two years ago there.  She went out of her way to see if there was anything else I needed help with, even though I did not find anything.  They have good furniture sales here, and would compare the furniture selection to Macy's.  I left really impressed as they met one of my most important rules as a customer-know me.  Thanks to the store manager, I'll continue to consider Z Gallerie for future home purchases.

Macy's your star is falling, soon it won't shine at all.  I went here on Sunday after seeing an item that the website was in stock in Men's wear so I stopped at the store on Sunday.  After looking and looking I could not find it so I asked for help from an associate.  She was beginning to help me but then the phone rang and she went to answer the phone.  I had visions of "always manning the desk" from Devil Wears Prada in my head.  She then tells me that it should be in Young Mens wear.  Well, checked there, so then she went with me and said the brand didn't have a sign it would just be intermingled with other stuff.  UMmm what?  So after spending 10 minutes with me the phone rang again and as she walked away she said well the computer says we have four but it must be wrong.  I have to go.  I walked out pretty disappointed.  So from this experience, I gathered:  1.  Your brand signage sucks.  2.  Your associates are more worried about answering the phone than in person customer service, 3.  I shouldn't trust your website.  Yikes.  I would normally give it a 1 star, but bumped it up to two since your associate actually took 10 minutes of their manning the desk time to help.  :-(

I love fresh and easy.  The staff is friendly and I'm always caught off guard when they bag my groceries.  My only gripe is that I was told by staff that they do not accept manufacturers coupons.  In this economy every nickel counts so I can't give them five stars.  Love their hummus-yum.

Although this experience in the furniture department stared back in the beginning of December the saga has not ended as of yet.  It began when I decided on two bedroom furniture pieces that I decided to order because of a sale.    Note, I've never had an issue with any past orders.  We split the order, as I paid for one piece with my credit card, and the other with cash.  One piece was stated that it was in stock ,and the other would need to be ordered.  I received a call that the orders were ready for delivery about six weeks later.  Because of a move, I ended up I rescheduled the delivery to my new place.  This is where it goes down hill fast on a sled--yikes.  I had a move in scheduled on Saturday to my new place by 9am.  Two days before the delivery I receive information the window is from 815-1015am.    I called customer service to see if I could be moved down the delivery window, as I would not be able to have access to the new place until 9am.  I was told no I would have to reschedule.  This cost me an additional days rent as I did not want to reschedule.  So Saturday morning arrives.  The delivery men were friendly, and told me I needed to take a look at the items.    Multiple issues--one piece was a different color than the other.  The item that was the correct color had been damaged in shipping and also had a factory defect in it.  So the delivery men told me that Macys would call me.  Me thinks not- as this delivery experience was leaving a terrible taste in my mouth.  I showed up at the store next day asking for a department manager.  I then had a useless associate say she could try to help, and then when I described what had taken place she stated she could not.  I went to another store to look at other pieces, as I figured it could only go further south.  I found something at Z Gallerie and then went back to Macys to talk with the department manager.    I was told if I wanted a new shipment it would be another 5 weeks, but was not offered any concessions due to their error.  I was also told I would have to wait 2 weeks for my cash refund.  I received a call from the manager that they cancelled the ordered on the 7th and my refund was processing.  I called today the 17th to customer service and was told my check was sent 02/10 from Florida.  Disgusting.  I don't think I will be doing business with Macys furniture again and if I do, it will only be on credit or debit card as my credit card was not charge for merchandise not received.  Macy's you've dissappointed me and you lost $1400 in furniture business.

Service was nice but the mediocre food could not be overcome.  I had their Rita.  They added orange juice to a margarita.  It's looked like a hodge podge of liquids when I got it.  Ordered the balsamic fries and could only eat three... Eww.  Not what I thought they were going to be at all.  I also had the turkey melt sandwich.  Too much barbecue sauce, it was masking the flavor of the sandwich.  Yuck.  I'm not coming back.  Parking is sparse.

My new shrimp burrito place.  I just finished with a Saturday work out stint and had to balance it out with a Shrimp burrito.  I didn't want to drive far and had always been meaning to stop here out of curiosity.  I'm glad I did.  It has a retro beach feel to it and they were cooking up a storm.  I asked about the size of the burrito since I was pretty hungry and they said about a pound.  I got it and no kidding, it was like a min football.  I got the spicy one and it was full of flavor.  Staff is extra helpful, they will walk it out to you and hand it to you instead of bellowing out a number like your at a cattle call.  I'm hooked.

This was a night of new taste experiences for me.  We arrived and the atmosphere was very light, ambient, and loungy.  No surprises since this is at the W Hotel.  The restaurant staff was very friendly, and we were greeted fairly quickly.  We ordered the edamame which was a first for me, (I'm behind the times on this one)  A nice different taste.   I ordered a blackberry smash which was nothing short of wonderful.  I definitely could have ordered a double.  Another person in our party had a cold sake that I found was soo good, I had to try it twice.  Our waiter was very friendly, down to earth and low key.  Amongst us we ordered some sushi, I ordered the Ji-Dori chicken and the other person in our group ordered the Braised Pork.  Apparently they were out of pork so that was not available which was a disappointment.   Food was out at a decent time and the sauce with the mushrooms and potatoes had a wonderful zing and afterbite.  Our sushi eater had his eyes rolling back the entire time with his head agaisnt the booth so I can only assume the experience was nothing short of orgasmic.  We only had a small snafu with a groupon discount, but that was corrected without issue.  I'll be sure again to come to try the pork and have multiple blackberry smashes.  Even though I have not been won over to try sushi, I'm more than willing to have this restaurant experience again.

Dreamy orange muffins, lemon zester cookies, and peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.  I went in this morning and ordered a bacon cheesy something something sandwich.  It wasn't bad it wasn't good.  It was non descriptive.   I figured that going forward I would just stick with the lunch sandwiches and salads.  I decided to grab a couple cookies and then saw this glazed orange muffin smile at me.  I couldn't resist, I ordered that to go as well.  It was perfect, I moved on from that mediocre breakfast sandwich in three bites.  Staff is friendly.  I don't like the parking here or lack of it but this is trending in a few places in Phoenix now.  Lastly on the lunch combos, they will let you substitute a cookie of your liking.  Try the lemon zester, it's like a refreshing lemon drop martini at happy hour.

I don't think I would come back to this one.  The service was mediocre, there was little to no air circulation in the booth area.  The seafood enchiladas I ordered were quite good as well as the margarita.  The restaurant was not very busy though around lunch so I don't hold out as that being a good sign.  The manager also barked alot at the staff in front of the customers.  This restaurant needs an intevervention.

We had one of the bottles of Malbec, the staff was friendly, the atmosphere was open, the music was very hip lounge.  Parking is a bit sparse, but I was lucky enough to nab an off street spot.  I will stop by next time for something from the menu.  The Malbec was wonderful.

Although, I missed the Taco happy hour I was able to get one of the Tortas sandwiches and the chips and guacamole.  The sandwich was very good and the guacamole had a wow factor as it is not the run of the mill stuff.  The patio has been recently done/updated and being it was a nice evening outside we got to enjoy eating out.  I did not get to take in the flamenco dancing before but have done so before and found it full of fun and totally enjoyable to watch.  This place has come so far.  Reminds me a bit of Hotel Babylon, but without the pretension

Updated and still great....I took a break from putting up Christmas decor.  I was in the mood for a torta so I decided to pop by.  Since my last visit, the patio has been expanded with some sun shades.  Art and the interior also have some bright updating done.   The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The guacamole is great and still a highlight for me.  I ordered the Carne Asada torta.  The food was out promptly and the music provides a great eclectic and urban feel.  Happy hour deals are great and include some food items.

For my 200th review, I finally stopped at the Parlor.  Funny thing in 15 years I've never taken notice of it.  I thought it was a small hair salon lol.  Once we walked in though realized this was going to be one of my regular restaurants.  Had a meat and cheese selection for an appetizer, great flavor.  I had a pasta dish with big chunks of bacon crunchies and red sauce, tres yum.  It was very busy but the noise level was great.  They also let you design your own pizza.  Great place and close to me=my new fave.

The neighborhood looks a little shaky, but the gas is cheap.  In fact, I find its probably the cheapest of all Shell stations I've been at in the valley.  I can't speak for the interior of the gas station itself, but use my shell card and they knock another nickel per gallon off the price.  No issues with beggars or other critters unlike many gas stations in central phoenix.

I just got done ordering some new eyeglasses from Ilori.  The staff are extremely pleasant in a Euro sophisticated way.  They have an extremely large selection or rimless mens frames which are nothing short of wonderful to wear for those of us that wear eyeglasses.  They explained in detail the mounting difference between my previous Bvlgari pair and what I ordered which was a Danish brand.  This shop is also paired with Optical Shop of Aspen.  They take FSA spending account cards which is extremely convenient.  One swipe of my FSA visa card and the order was placed.  At the end they even have a celebration, a dark chocolate truffle and a bottled water.  Sounds a little Ab Fab, but it was a nice touch.  I should have my new glasses within seven days, I'm excited for a new look.  FYI-no exams are done here.  Also try on the Tag Heur line.  All brands are high end.  I tried a Tag pair of aligator sunglasses that were a knockout, until I saw the price, chuckled and placed them back where I found them.

I finally found my perfect in a salon not far from where I live.  I arrived at the salon and they offered me a number of drinks while I waited.  Rick's assistant greeted me promptly, told me it would be about ten minutes from my appointment time that they would be ready (in some salons I've waited 20-25), washed my hair thouroughly and then introduced me to Rick.  Everyone at the salon was very friendly and personalable which was a breath of fresh air.  Rick was very attentive to my needs, and picked out the right color shade to bring the grays back under control which is important to every job seeker in tihis economy!  The color did not burn like it has at previous salons, and Rick's assistant did a great job of cleaning my hair up and giving me a head massage.  Then Rick gave me a meticulous cut.  He then had me fill out a customer information card which was something new, but showed that they cared about you coming back.  I then got a business card for 50% off my next visit.  I did have a moment of sticker shock at the price, but for the 1.5 hours I was there and being I left completely satisfied, it was worth it.  Change is good!

This business is booming and is for good reason.  Great service, great artists, and great experiences.  I wanted to try a new hair style and for us 40 somethings change can be a little scary out of the comfort zone.  Well I asked Rick to give me a cut similar to a model in a magazines cut.  Well he did and let's say that it looked better on the model.  Since it didn't work, I contacted Rick to have it switched back to before and he made time for me in his busy schedule to put my hair back on track.  He did not charge me and was more than gracious.  I also love that they carry my favorite hair paste which is hard to find in Phoenix aquage.  Its great for fine hair.  They also have tasty beverages ready when I walk in which is appreciated in the morning if I have not had my coffee.  Love, Love, Love R Salon.

This is one of my favorite lunch places-rivals Pita Jungle, especially when I want to mix up my mediterranean with french fries.  Prices are great for lunch, and you can opa size for a couple bucks more to include a salad or fries and a drink.  You can't beat it.  To go service is fast and food is always tasty.  Love the big gyro salad.  Staff is very friendly.

OK, I'll admit it, I get my once a week Culver's fix.  Usually the delux double w/fries....can you say good times.  I've done the chicken sandwich once and was not impressed so I'd stick with a burger which is very addictive.  Ever since Culver's opened, I have not set foot in a Wendys for their double.  Reminds me of grilled goodness from the midwest.  Friendly staff too.

Wednesday's here rock it out!  Happy hour prices all night on cocktails and appetizers.  My favorite drink here is their margaritas.  Strong and good.  2 of these for $10 gets your happy on!  The ceviche is perfect with the line notes leaving it my favorite ceviche.  The hapu and Mahi are great macadamia crusted fish entrees.  My go to regular is the Thai chicken bowl.  Staff is friendly and atmosphere is open.  Diversity is welcome here.

Don't let the big box size fool you.  Service is no-nonsense and top notch.  I stopped in for tequila.  I know little of tequila aside from you don't buy it you rent it hehe.  I asked one of the staff for their opinion and he was not afraid to recommend the one that was not as expensive as the other but fit my needs, 1800.  I hooked up with 750ml and mixers, did I mention mixers mixers mixers!  I also needed assistant locating Compari.  Voila,  the service associate had the isle and type of liquor memorized.  Don't forget the best features here price and enormous selection.

Great food and friendly service, atmosphere lacks an Italian feel.  I went here on Sunday evening.  Its not a large restaurant, its clean and well lit.  First though walking in was though it was modern and minimalist.  Didn't speak Italian to me, so I figured would wait for the food.  Our first round of drinks was a little watered down, but didn't mention anything as my blue mojito seemed removed from the world of Italy.  When they brought the food, though it spoke wonderful Italian.  We had the aspargus with parmesan and mushrooms to start.  I am no fan of mushrooms, but these were great.  Buttery, not too chewy, and just right.  My ex and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  Portions were just right and the sauce was perfect, not too thick and perfect in its tomatoess.  Food was brought out fairly quickly.  I look forward to coming again, my only impression leaving was with the interior, it felt kind of like the Pei Wei of Italian, just lacking the red trademark Pei Wei lighting.  Maybe they can substitute yello or blue and make it trade mark Babbo.

This place is hot and cold.  When the service is good its great, when its not so good, its like cool oyster stew, no appeal whatsoever.  This appointment was for an 82500 mile service.  I'm getting ready to trade my s60 but the wonderful (bingo board) check engine light was on yet again (one of the reasons im trading it) and so I instructed them to do the 82500 mile service on my Volvo and tell me what the check engine light came on four.  This was yesterday.  They told me they were not busy.  I received a call 4 hours later telling me what it was and then when I asked if my extended warranty covered it, I was told they were closed.  So nothing has been done at my car at this point, but you are calling to see if you can pocket another $400?  Not impressed.  I told him to complete the 82500 mile service, follow through on contacting the warranty company to see if they will cover the check engine light.  I asked if they were almost done with the 82500 service and was told yes.  I needed my car for work lunch.  Another 4 hours later and finally told it was ready.  That's another reason why I'm ditching Volvo for Acura.  When I've complained of the various issues I've had with mine, the service department took the liberty to give sales my phone number to try to sell me a new Volvo.  No thanks, no thanks, and again no thanks.

Found my back-up to my fave today--my fave sandwich that is.  I earned a freebie meal after coming umpteen times.  I strayed out of my comfort zone for a hot Cuban, panini sandwich for takeout to work for lunch.  This sandwich was great.  It will never displace my chicken walnut but, its nice to have a stand in in case the chicken walnut needs a break.  Service here is always friendly strong and consistent.

My friend and I stopped in here after I saw a great purple shirt on display.  Fun store, and here comes the hook....they were serving mimosas, scones, cupcakes.  I had the refreshing mimosa.  I didn't end up getting the shirt due to the price, however, they offered us a traveller on another mimosa.  Impressed, nice touch 7 for all Mankind staff.

Classy furniture for those with discerning tastes.  Prices are high for items, but there are sales, and then when you ask more questions, the sales staff indicates that all furniture items are custom made.  Hence, the prices are higher, because there are no factories full of Chinese children making them.  In fact alot of items showed they were American made.  What a novel concept.  Sales stuff is very helpful, and items are one of a kind.  Dress your room to impress here.

I'm impressed so far and I consider the experience not to be complete as of yet.  I scheduled an eye exam this morning and was helped by Dr David Anderson.  I wear contacts and glasses and have issues with allergies.  He observed that my eyelids were puffy and had me try Elestat which I've never tried before.  OMG, this is some good stuff.  It made a huge difference on how my eyes felt.  We discussed my approaching need for bifocals in the future and agreed to hold off for now.  Ohh, the joys of age 40.  Then due to my eye allergies I'm currently doing a 2 week trial pair of contact lens versus the one month disposables i've been currently using.  I have a follow up for saturday appointment for an eye dilation to see if I need to go on some steriods, but I'm truly impressed with how thorough Dr Anderson has been so far.  The office staff is friendly as well.  Now, I can't speak for the service of obtaining eyeglasses, but so far I'm pretty sure i will be a repeat customer.  Thanks.

Terrible service.  Ordered a coffee maker through their website to be picked up at the store.  I opened a new card to score another discount on top of a sale.  I showed up to pick it up asking about the new card discount.  He asked if I got the coupon I said no and he referred me to an 800 number.  WTF!  I don't think this guy cared about my business.  I then asked if he could apply the rewards I was given.  He couldn't do that either with an excuse.  I then said I didn't want the merchandise he then did a return without blinking.  Guess what you lost my business and I closed a brand new card relationship with you.  Reinforcement of why your business is declining.  Hello Amazon and Bed Bath and Beyond.

Returns only on Mondays?  One of the things I love about Macys is their no hassle returns.  After purchasing a light leather coat for an upcoming concert at the  Fashion square location, I decided to return it on my lunch hour.  The sales associate had a great sense of humor informing me that I missed the Monday's only return deadline by a number of hours and that I would have to wait until next Monday.  I jokingly asked if we could make a Tuesday exception since Tuesdays are better than Mondays.  She agreed punched a few keys and sent me on my way.  More and more stores barrage you with questions on returns, but not Macys.  This is one of the little things that keeps me coming back and keeps me loyal.  It may be a big department store chain, but the style and philosophy outshine the other competition in a heartbeat.  It's all about superior service.  Even if I do not usually purchase from this particular location, the transaction reminds me why I keep coming back to others.

I actually have not used the Sunglass Hut inside the Fashion Square but the kiosk inside of Macy's.  I have nothing but praise for Sunglass Hut.   I purchased a pair of Vercace's for a pretty penny about a year and a half ago in the Anthem store, but dropped by this kiosk as my glasses looked bent and had that oops, I just sat on them look.  I was afraid I would end up having to buy another pair, as one of the bolts in the lenses appeared to be loose.  This is the second time I've dropped by at this location.  The sales associate gladly adjusted the pair and did it with a precise finesse.  All this at no charge.  These glasses may have cost me more than $200 but between the style, superb service and multi locations at where you can drop by, I would definitely go here again. I'm as good as new, thanks.

Too busy, this place is just not my demographic.  The music is great but it just feels like a going to a large estate sale in the Midwest where people are drinking cocktails while shopping for that eclectic item that no one else wants besides themselves.  Drinks are good, little spendy considering the vibe.  Great eye candy for me, kinda of like an old school Dr Pepper commercial, great for thirty seconds, you can look but not touch.

Eat, drink, repeat.  This was a wonderful dinner.  We started with the tortilla espanola and my friend who went to Spain recently said it was better than what he had in Spain.  I ordered the Salpicon de Congrejo and it was very light and refreshing.  The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and down to earth.  We then ordered the Pollo colonial and lomo con romesco.  The flavor was beyond belief, it was so pleasing to the palate.  My chicken had this wonderful crispiness that was yet still delicate and flavorful.  My glass of malbec was really good.  The owner also came to our table and asked how everything was and apologized for it the restaurant temperature being too cold, but we did not find it cold, so it was great to meet the owner.  To top it off I had a an almond desert that was unique.  The music and atmosphere was perfect,  I can't wait to come here again, I know some folks have mentioned the portion sizes ,but I found the key is to order a number of dishes together and share.  Lastly, thanks groupon for the introduction, this place really stands out.

Somethin is off balance at this place.  I decided to pop in as it is right next to Taco Bell.  The picture of the Big Nachos or oh la la nachos, or whatever looked really good.  Why doesn't anything look as good as the photo ever.  Anyway it's just a hole in the wall, but they are friendly I ordered the nachos to go and got my order fairly quickly.  I got it home and was surprised......heavy stuff, I opened it and was amazed at how much food.  Here's the problem....flavor or lack there of it.  The beef had no flavor, lots of it, but no flavor.  It also did not have much cheese.  The guacamole also did not have much in the way of flavor.  I was very hungry so I ate alot of it, but I think some of these places including this one get the balance wrong.  The order doesn't have to be huge, it could have been 3/4 of the size, just make up for it in flavor.  I'm still a little surprised at how a Mexican food place like this could have little flavor.  Go to the coach next to Charlies on Camelback instead--their asad burritos are to die for.

Once I decided to switch this from a possible weekend burger choice to a work lunch choice, this fit it perfectly for me.  I like how they let me choose the bun that I want for my classic smash and if I ask for a side of mayo or anything it's brought out without hesitation.  The wait is quick, the place is clean, the menu is not that complicated.  Most importantly the burger has really great flavor for the money spent.  Perfect for lunch when the last thing I want to do is think, at least too much.    Smashburger you are a smash.  Now how trite is that. lol.

Nice small intimate location.  Come for the happy hour drinks and appetizers.  The spring rolls are great.  The pork entree I had was a little dry, but the broth it was it was perfect.  Staff is friendly, great date night place.  One detractor, there is little lighting in the parking in back, a little spooky.

Excellent food, mediocre quality cocktails so not a place to get a quality drink on.  I went out of my comfort zone and tried tuna tartar tonight.  Wonderful.  I had a Bellini.  It was tiny for the price and was not impressive.  I did have the beef short rib and asparagus side.  Perfectly cooked and great flavor.  Staff is great.  Decor is subdued, it's missing something.  I would return again.

Best donuts in the valley.  Homer Simpson would feel right at home.  They have several varieties, flexible store hours and also a good assortment of drinks to wash down the donuts .  I opted today for the apple filled and triple chocolate cake with milk.  Both were yummy, the apple filling reminded me of apple pie.  I don't eat donuts often, but when I do I choose BOSA.

My new car's date place.  Did the $8 freaky clean wash for the Volvo as it looked like it been through sub saharan Africa.  Abracadrabah, and the little black tank looks like a freaky clean black little tank machine.  Also free vacuum is included.

I stopped in because I reached my Groupon expiration date.  I flew solo on this one and Im glad that I did.  The place is small, relaxed, and casual, but great for a small group of friends/family.  I was seated immediately and my waiter was very friendly, attentive and direct, just as I like.  I ordered the bread and the pepperoni pizza.  I rarely order pepperoni.  This was probably the best pepperoni pizza I've had.  The slices were perfect circles and the flavor was great, not too overwhelming.  Sauce had great flavor also.  The cheese bread was great, though didn't stick out in my mind.  This would be a great lunch date, or date night place.

Terrible service for large groups.  A reservation was set up for a large group of about 10 people.  The table was reserved and set aside ok.  The staff appeared helpful, courteous and friendly.  The atomospher was cosmopolitan and very urban.  I ordered the Chilean Sea bass as I am not a sushi person.  My cocktail was wonderful and refreshing.  Once we were finished, the nightmare began.  Our waitress put all of our orders on the same ticket, so she could get the large group standard 18%  gratuity.  The orders were all together so my boyfriend and I had to find what we had, total it and calculate gratuity tax, etc.  We had to do this for each person/couple in our group.  It took over an hour to do so.  Then the expected confrontation began.  The waitress, stated that we were short $55.  This is after number of people paid much more than what they owed.  Because of the all the people it also took some time to run cards.  We were told that this is how they do this, but for large groups its a nightmare and always sets up ugly situations.  If they had seperated our orders, It would have meant a little more work for the waitress up front, but no terrible experience at the end.  Our entire group stated that they never wanted to come here again.  Large groups beware!

I used my Living Social voucher today and I think I'm ready to be a repeat customer.  The inside is nice with a minimalist, zin zen zang feel.  The only thing I did find a bit annoying is that in the waiting area, there is a small couch and one chair that appears to a massage chair or some speciality chair  that nobody wanted to use, because it looked like abstract art.  It was busy and it seemed like a total cluster f...k.  The staff were friendly and gave me a quick tour.    I appreciated the tour and was impressed with the tub room as that looked really relaxing.  As far as the hair care area, it was no big deal.  When it comes to hair I go more for the za za zu, then the subdued.    Shannon was my massage therapist and she was really good, not a lot of idle chit chat and see seemed very focused which I enjoyed.  I tried the hot stone upgrade but was not really impressed.  It was nice, but I think my expectation anticipation was higher than what it panned out to be.  Shannon did a great job and identified a couple of problem areas.   I did like the fact that they explained their memberships that are available and am thinkiing about the lower end one.  They wanted to get me set up on two week massages which I thought was excessive.  I think with massages, its not the same as something you can see like hair, facials, etc so I think the benefits are probably more noticable after time.    I did see they offered the HCG also there, but I wouldn't be surprised if a person starts seeing it in the grocery next to the canned meats lol so that did not seem like a big deal.     This is a nice place for the price and worth checking out.

Stay far away!  Do not give this business your credit card for a spa membership.  They will continue to charge you after you have cancelled.  I stopped going here for massages in the spring of 2012, as my therapist towards the end of the massage either had fallen asleep during the massage or was pleasuring himself as he had switched to one hand barely massaging me at the end.  I did not want to see what he was doing as I was on my back on the table.  I suspended my  monthly membership back in March or April of 2012 for three months to think about whether or not to give them a second chance.  I decided to move on and had mailed a cancellation to them in July of 2012.  They continue to charge my credit card $39 a month, which I end up having my credit card company charge them back every month since.  I have left their office messages to stop charging me and they leave me voice mails to call them back.  I have escalated it to the better business bureau.  FYI-Blue Sol your stupidity is costing you extra money in charge back fees--about seven so far.

Parking is horrible, but then again you get what you pay for.  The fitness center itself is nice, but it takes an average of 15-20 minutes to find a parking spot.  I think I'll spend the extra money for a health club with ample parking.

This gym doesn't care about renewal customers on prepaids.  Parking is like Mad Max beyond Thunderdome.  Two men entering one man leaves!  When staff advised me of my renewal they shot me $200 for one year.  I ended up signing up at LA fitness getting $20 per month.   Staff is friendly and machines are clean. Men's bathroom has almost always one stall that's trashed.  My friend has had his locker broken into and wallet stolen.  U Fit you are not a good fit after all.   Pay a bit extra and get a lot more....

This is a great fast food alternative for chicken lovers.  The chicken has great taste, the sauce is flavorful and has a southern soulful flavor.  Staff is friendly and the coleslaw is not bad either.  The box combo is one of my lunch alternative faves.  This is a great alternative to the usual burger joints.

This place has a nice twist on Italian.  The atmosphere is great its wide open.  You can see everything in the kitchen from meats being cut to things being cooked, there should be an Food Network focus show done here!  The lighting is wonderful, I even picked up some interior design ideas.  The food was extremely tasty, a little on the salty side,  but it probably was the pruiscuitto.   The wait staff is extremely friendly and there is complementary valet.  North, I've made a new friend, I'm excited to get to know you and your menu in the future and develop a tasty culinary relationship.  FYI-this is a great date place.  It will delight your date as its not trite.

It's fast food, but I find this is actually my tied for number #1 chicken strip shack.  Also love, love, love the Cains sauce, they should be selling this at the grocery store.  Food quality is consistent, and hot, and the fries are the good crinkle cut ones like I had when I was a kid.

Great place for first rate jewelry.  The staff is very professional and courteous.  They also due to the price of the merchandise take time to explain the why's behind questions you have on sizing etc.  I purchased a green onyx bracelet from here after viewing it a number of times.  The associate explained the new cable the beads sat on to me eliminating breakage on older models.  I then inquired on a necklace and we determined that 22 inches is about appropriate size.  Make sure that you love what you are buying here:  return policy is within 10 days for store credit.  You also definitely pay for the David Yurman name. On an impressive note, I asked what if my bracelet broke after the ten days.  The associate told me to specifically ask for him and he would make it right. Stunning jewelry for individual tastes.

Staff is unfriendly here.  I pulled into the parking lot and was getting out of the car.  It was 850pm and the sign said open.  One of the staff members pushing a garbage can said we are closed, "no mo" I asked aren't you open until 9?  He said yes, but the last people are in the drive thru now and that's all.  Your sign says open, but you say closed?  I guess you're more concerned with going home for the evening then my business.  Poor representation of your company.  Plenty of substitutes.  I'll stay with Pei Wei.  For a buck or two more, the service is superior and no comparison between the two.

This place is so great there is a line outside the door!  Staff is friendly we were seated quickly and the environment is totally casual.  The menu is pretty extensive with plenty of burger choices as well  as sides.  My bbq burger was great, the sauce was sweet and smoky, and the onion rings I ordered were perfect.  I received 5 huge ones.  Wait staff is really friendly and makes you feel completely comfortable.  I'm definitely going to be back.

This is my favorite Asian cuisine/martini happenin place in Central Phoenix.  Staff is very helpful, relaxed and friendly.  Our waitress had great knowledge of the martini and food menus.  Service was fast, atmosphere is very loungy/relaxed and there are specials twice a week.  Food has wonderful flavor and portions are perfect.  Price is extra nice.  There is also a late night Martini happy hour for like $5 a piece and great dj dance music.  Location is perfect.  Can't wait to go again.

Best flavorful food out of all Mexican fast casual restaurant chains.  My favorite two items are the tacos and the salad.  The tacos with grilled chicken rock!  I added some of their ranch dressing and special crumble cheese to mine and they were wonderful. The taco salads are great also.  Lots of flavor.  Unlike other previous reviewers I do not need a concierge to work my way through a fast casual restaurant.  Read the website, take more than 2 minutes to read signage and ask questions if needed.  Staff is friendly sometimes a little slow in the head but I don't consider this full service.  They have daily specials unlike chipotle or Qdoba and outdoor seating options.  Check out the drink options,  amazing refreshing choices like sugar free strawberry lemonade.  Delicious

The sandwiches have great flavor and there are a number of different side choices.  The staff is very friendly and there is plenty of seating.  It's also very clean and it's a great location.  There are also both breakfast and lunch sandwiches.  Only tip I have is that if you are very hungry you'll probably lean hungry after as the sandwich size is relatively small.  Great place for a light lunch if you anticipate a larger meal after.

Seating is in short supply here!  There are also no misters outside for summer seating. Great flavorful enchiladas done Chipotle assembly style with a local Phoenix twist.  Multiple meat, cheese and sauce selections.  They are so great they allow you to mix and match!  I had the pork and chicken.  I loved the slaw add on, I don't see that often.  They also heat it up in a fire.  You also have two different style enchilada shells.  Staff is very helpful and guided me in my first time ordering.  I left with a hook up-enchilada style!  I'll be back soon.

Mediocre food and mediocre service =a big pass in by at this place.  In our group of two adults and two children food was lemon lemon lemon.  We all lost.  I ordered the speciality buffalo chicken pizza but my chicken did a disappearing act because it was not there.  One of the kid had chicken strips but the chicken looked like it was electrocuted on a fence or something.  We had to ask for beverage refills.  My side salad looked dumped out of a bag.  Cheese also looked byproduct like.  To top it off the price was not too nice.  New Yorkers would not be proud of this Native...

Downright rude staff.  I walked into the men's area and the associated looked at me and started laughing at me.   Not sure why there were no stains on my shirt and my watch was Gucci.  She then said may I help you and started chuckling again after giving an up and down look.  I've never purchased coach products and after this experience I won't be starting any time soon either

Tillys Outlet Great Place to refresh your t shirt collection on the cheap for those hot AZ days.  They have a huge selection of 2 for $30 t shirts, and the brands are good brands.  Last time I stopped, I picked up two Fox t-shirts, that would have been considerably more at other places.  They also consistently have other name brands like RVCA, Matix, Hurley, etc.  Also, if you order something online, you can return it to the store directly.  I have also found a decent selection of Nixon watches.  I also found lots of short selection in various styles.  Of course, there are many a things this forty something saw that were not age appropriate for me, but you can still get your Southern California groove on, and if you give them your address, they will mail you 20% off coupons.

Flavor, Flavor and more flavor!  This is my new favorite asian restaurant choice and replaces my old standard PF.  Changs.  The location in the Biltmore is great, and we went on a Sunday evening, so it was nice and quiet.  The ambiance is a bit more sophisticated then PF Chang's or at least the feel of the place.  Wait staff is helpful and straightforward.  We had the chicken lettuce wraps which had a great flavor to them, more of a zesty flavor.  I then had some Princess chicken dish that had a bit of a curry base.  It was great and the food had a good texture as well.  My friend had orange chicken which has a great a great zest to it.  Service was fast, and I'm looking forward to trying many other asian fusion dishes here also.

This is a great gym with lots of options that you can tailor to your own tastes.  My prevous gym membership with another place was expiring and I stopped in a couple months ago to get pricing options.  I was helped by the manager and he gave me multiple options, including prepaid and various monthly options.  Shortly my previous gym membership expired I signed up and got a very fair deal $20/month with $149 as initiation fee.  Since I'm planning on being there at least two years or more, initiation fee was not an issue.  There is plenty of parking, area is bit sketcy, but that's Phoenix, always changing and a huge starbucks just went up close by.  Staff is friendly, even if you don't have a personal trainer.  I did the intiial personal trainer session.  Caleb was great, I didn't sign up due to the high cost and commitment period.  I didn't feel high pressure however, and he still says hi when he sees me there.      I have been to two yoga classes now, and the instructors are great.  I've done Yoga at home but these instructors know how to bend, twist and shape you.  They are extra friendly and there are multiple time slots.  I've done the Saturday and Sunday morning ones.  The gym is kept clean, I have not used the locker rooms at this point. There are also a large number of both cardio and weight machines.     I'm glad I've joined LA fitness and it's encouraged the best thing to keep me going in my workouts--VARIETY.  Thanks, LA!  Bring it on!

The best place to score Under Armour gear at below sale prices if you follow their emails.  Great selection for an outlet store.  They have a great 2 for sales.  Last sale got a pair of blue workout shorts with matching work out t shirt for $30.  Smokin.  The heat gear is perfect for Arizona summers and Nike has nothing considerable to really compare to in selection and price.  Also periodically they will run special sales, buy $100 of gear get $20 gift card.

Wonderful tasty food and attentive service, what more could you ask for?  My friend and I caught happy hour, and were able to get a couple cocktails.  Both were great, mine has a block cube of ice in it with a couple herbs in the cube.  Loved it, it's the little touches.  I ordered the pork filet minion and my bestie had a burger and fries.  Mine was excellent and also had a squash compote which was yummy, but that was it. It's ala carte if you want a second side.  Both entrees were yummy.  We both got desserts and mine actually was the highlight, it was the salted caramel dessert.  It tasted just like Wurthers candies like at grandpas but even better.  My friend had the gluten free chocolate. Oh la la, yummo.  Service informative, attentive and friendly.

When I need to represent my peeps I go here.  The dance floor is the best amongst all of the LGBT venues in Phoenix/Scottsdale and to top it off they keep it clean.  Someone breaks a glass, poof the mess is gone like it didn't exist.  Also what stands out is the owner Stacy.  He goes out of his way to say hello to everyone, and does not seem aloof like many other bar owners.  Crowd is mixed, varied, and the patio has heaters for the winter.  Drink selection is good, plenty of stuff on tap.  I'm proud to see my business go to such a great place.  Last, but not least I've never seen a cheezoid bar fight here.  It says a lot to not have to worry about drink splash back from a crazy.

Love this place.  Cheese, wine, and yummy macaroons.  Staff is very attentive, there are plenty of dessert choices also.  They also have gelato which seems mysterious, but I guess it's just a train ride between France and Italy.  I plan on perusing the wine selection more next visit.  The place definitely has a French feel and flair.

Fantastic food and service.  As a PF Chang's insider, I've had quite a bit of exposure to various dishes.  Went on the 4th of July, it was slow but got a nice central booth.  Ordered a Asian Pear mojito.  It was balanced and delicious.  I ordered some sushi with scallops.  It was not one of my faves but just getting into various sushi types.  Waitress was wonderful, I ordered King Pao scallops and they were cooked perfectly.  I wish I could cook them like that.  I ordered banana rolls with caramel and pineapple ice cream to go.  She had it packed separately and had ice around the container of ice cream.  Bottom line, I've been here multiple times and both the food and service is consistently great.

This place is a health hazard.  Don't look up at the ceilings, it's enough to make you wheeze.  The seating is terrible, went here for Rocky horror, the chairs look 50 years old from some old legion hall.  They booked two events here at the same time, a rap show on one end at the same time as Rocky Horror.  The screens were tiny, they looked like the size used in a junior high school classroom.  Air circulation was terrible.  Tons of security everywhere, made me wonder how safe the place was.  What a dump, bring an inhaler if you set foot in here.

Nice cozy atmosphere and fantastic food.  I took my parents here on a Saturday for Mexican seafood.  Del Mar didn't disappoint or I would have heard about it... From my parents lol.  Our server was friendly we were early for our reservation but they didn't make us wait.  We ordered flavored margaritas and mojitos.  It took a coupe tries to get the favor matching what we ordered but no biggie.  We ordered ceviche and a stuffed pepper appetizer.  Both-yummy.  Then the entrees cod, and seafood enchiladas.  My mom said the cod was the best she ever had, perfect.  The enchiladas were great also.  The Mac and cheese side rocks.  Fuego Del Mar, you have my moms seal of approval.  Enough said!

This credit union provides slow service, defects in service requiring multiple visits/contacts to resolve errors, and  lack of product knowledge.  I refinanced my car because I saved some money with a 1% interest reduction and a 1% cash bonus that was provided upon funding my loan.  Two weeks ago, I showed up at the branch to sign auto loan refinance documents.  They were not ready, I had to wait twenty minutes.  All of the loan documents were not correct.  I was also suppose to have a savings account set up at time of close.  This was not ready.  The branch banker also did not have copies of all documents I signed so I had to ask.  The branch banker tried to rush me through the closing.  I had to ask for an atm card.  It now has been two weeks, my current lender has not been paid.  I also have not received an atm card.  I went to the branch to find out what was going on.   I feel like doing business here is like going to a self service gas station.  There is no service If you don't do it all on your own!  I was told by the team lead, that the card had not been issued due to reissuance of other cards due to the Target stores breach.  Terrible excuse.  I also asked if a check was issued to my current lender.  The loan was not funded for five days after document signing.  Umm what?  The check has been issued but not cleared.  I then withdrew all bu t the minimum required balance needed in my savings account.  I do not trust Desert Schools at all at this point.  The only thing that has arrived has been my payment book.  It arrived promptly today.  Funny they want money for a service that has not even been provided.  I was even told in error today that I would receive monthly payment statements.  I received two coupon books.  This place is a hot mess. If I can find an even better refinance deal down the road, I'm moving on.

This is s great representation of a bank that has little care for the customer experience.  I tried out this bank thinking I would move from the big four.  It was not a score.  I was unable to reach phone customer service after holding for a hour.  I was unable to access my savings account at the arm.  Check prices were outrageous.  No personal bankers at this location when I was there to close my accounts.  They didn't even ask me why I was closing my accounts.   Terrible bank, subpar company.

The best Thai Dynamite chicken I've had in Phoenix.  I was sad that I lost Sochu house and then heard about Red Thai.  Love the openness of the space inside and the minimalist decor works well here.  The Japanamation is also a fun touch on the walls.  They have martinis similar to Sochu as well as the wonderful sugar cane pork.  Red Thai, you're a little further away but worth the drive.  I can't wait for my next red martini at Red Thai.

Not impressed with this small cracker box that charges $20 just to walk in the door.  There is no place to sit unless you want bottle service.  Music sucks, DJ has an apple computer doing bizarre remixes.  Drinks are expensive bar staff is friendly but go go boys or whatever they are have way too much attitude.  I've been to many different clubs in San Francisco with little or no cover and a lot more fun for the money.  I'm not sure how long this place will last.

Great place to buy a birthday treat for a friend or relative.  I bought a huge birthday chocolate chip cookie for a friend of mine through Groupon.  The process was easy, I stopped by, got a couple cookies for myself while I ordered the big one.  I told the person taking the order what I wanted and the date and then a week later, stopped in and picked it up.  It was fantastic and very professional.  The cookie was perfect and my friend was pretty surprised, it took him over a week to eat the entire thing.

This is my new Greek fast casual regular restaurant.  The gyro meat is delicious and they have plenty of outdoor seating.  Staff is friendly, they have Greek music playing.  Get ready to break some plates!  Get the cheese fries, it's one of their specialties and delicious.

The best Key Lime Pie this side of the Mississippi.  I came, I saw, I selected.  I tasted and my mouth smiled from ear to ear.  The bakery isn't huge in size but is tremendous in taste.  Kudos!!

This is a great live music venue with amazing. Acoustics and sound systems.  It has two floors with an upper patio area.  Staff and security are helpful and friendly.  The bathrooms have an attendant, an interesting Scottsdale touch.  Drink prices are spending though.  $8/beer.  Saw the English beat, great 80s band.  They had two opening bands so it was a while for the headliner but the openers were good as well.  I can't wait to come here again.

Food is good, turn around in receiving orders is fairly quick.  Ordered the pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza.  Came with thin crust which is exactly what I like.  They plenty of beer on tap including Dos Equis and Blue Moon.  Service was a little detached in the beginning.  We got our drinks and our bartender/server disappeared for 10-15 minutes and it was dead inside.  Love the location as its close to home.  Will return soon, thanks!

The best bbq I've had in Phoenix.  I had the beef brisket bbq burrito and choose what I wanted in it.  Tons of choices, I had pickles, coleslaw, and others I can't remember.  Then I got to choose two sides, I had the beans and coleslaw.  The beans were delicious with big chunks of bacon.  The slaw was decent.  Staff is very helpful navigating the menu and how it works.  I can't wait to try something new the next time!
