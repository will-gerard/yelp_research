I'm not sure why people have any problem with Favs. Every time that I go here, which is like once a week.  The tortillas are always fresh and the meat is perfectly cook. My favorite part of Favs is there delusions red and green sauce.  Everyone is always very nice there and the front area is always very cleaned up. Any time I want a burrito, I will always go to Favs!!!

I have been really excited to eat at ATL Wings. I've heard nothing but great things about the place. But my experience was different. It wasn't extremely busy when I walked in to order and it didn't take much time to get my order in. One of the problems was that it took over 30 minutes to get my food. All I ordered was 10 wings and a Cajan fry. The wings were below average compared to others and the fries were not good as well. They also did not have any forks and seemed pretty under staffed. Like I said I have been really excited to eat at ATL but after my experience I will not go back at all.

The pizza is amazing every time I go. Everyone that works there is always very nice.   The manager John always remembers my kids names. Any time we go out to eat pizza we always go to Barros. Last year my family came out from Chicago and they said that this was the closest they've had to the pie back home.   We will continue to come to Barros because it is by far the best!
