Hard to find an auto repair place you can trust. I have been here twice and they are trustworthy, fair and helpful. Great service, fair prices.

The employees here need some serious training. They have no concept of customer service. They also have supply chain issues (always out of product and never know when it is coming in). I have tried Marvel a few times and each time the experience got worse. Will never go back now.

Used them many years ago and they were great but it looks like their service has gone downhill. It took three appointments to get it right to fix an AC unit. Each time they had the wrong part or no part at all. Hold time on customer service line was 12 minutes. Would not use them again.

First time at St. Francis last night. Good menu selection, had an excellent server, good portion size and excellent meal.  I tried the chicken salad for dinner and it was tasty and just then right size.  They have provided a nice atmosphere with exposed brick, stainless steel tables, and just the right amount of lighting and music.    Only downside was the backless seats at our booth. Very trendy, but somewhat uncomfortable. Ask for a table instead and you'll be fine.   I'll return.

Outdated interior and plastic seats, but this is my favorite Thai food in PHX. Seems like it may be family owned and service is good. Fairly priced and good central location.

This is my favorite grocery store in Arizona and California. Healthy foods without the whole foods prices. Large enough store to carry everything you need but small enough to be manageable and to get in and out quickly. Staff is always professional and nice. Live their prepared meals and store brand items.

I will have to agree with the earlier review posted here on the gym. The gym facility is outstanding, and the equipment they do have is top of the line and brand new, but they are still missing many, many pieces of equipment and we keep getting the run around on when the remaining equipment is coming. The membership fees here are among the highest in PHX so I think the members should have a complete gym. They also charge a twice yearly "upgrade fee" (in addition to the monthly fee) so I think we should expect a nicely equipped gym, it's just not there yet.   The gym is dead right now, and I feel that this is because they have zero presence on google and search engine marketing. When you search for "gold's gym downtown phoenix", google brings you to the Awautukee location. They have completely ignored web marketing and this will be a problem for new business if they don't fix it.   I am waiting to see if they finally reply to me about the equipment issue and will change the rating here once we get a complete gym.

Food was actually pretty good, very fresh. But I have never seen a restaurant be so stingy with portions. Geez! They get out an exact measuring device for each and every ingredient. I'm surprised they didn't weigh the salad at the end to be 100% certain it was 5.7897 ounces. A little short on the portion size and you pay a little too much for what you get.   It is clean, and staff is customer friendly.

One of my favorites. Imagine Chipotle at much higher level with the best possible ingredients. Love, love this place and crave it a couple times per week.

There are two kinds of companies you must totally trust: 1. Auto mechanics 2. Plumbers Why? Because both of them can essentially tell you anything and charge for it and you have no way of knowing the truth.   I 120% trust this plumber. Have used for over 5 years now and they always take care of it in a fair and prompt way. I would recommend unconditionally.
