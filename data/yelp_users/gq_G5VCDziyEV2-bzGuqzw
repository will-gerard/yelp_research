The pseudo-hubster LOVES this place and drags me along every once and again. The salsas, I think, suck, so that's a big time star auto-deduct. It's pretty dumpy inside and out, and it's almost always dead... this is pretty much the entire reason I like it. We can come here without seeing a soul we know, enjoy some good, traditional Mexican food, and enjoy a cerveza in peace.

I give China Chili 5 stars because it has some treats I can't find anywhere else. I've had quite a few things on their menu and I've only disliked one thing. My favorites include the steamed won-tons (very speesy spicy and sweet at the same time, so my man and I will literally battle if they give us an odd number. It gets bloody.), chicken corn chowder (introduced to me by the harbinger of good soups and even better taste, my dearly departed best friend Andre), mushroom and spinach soup (HUGE meaty mushroom chunks with tofu and spinach in a light chicken broth... it's light but flavorful), and my aforementioned sparring partner/boyfriend is crazy about the salt and pepper beef, which is a reasonable and edible facsimile of pepper spray when you get it made like he does. I can't even swallow the stuff, but he just powers it down like drano in a tub.  We very rarely eat there because the decor is just so tacky, but we love it so much, we ordered out for it on our anniversary. Be that a testament to its deliciousness or our stubbornness is your decision.

It really isn't bad for what it is. I'm currently mowing down on one of the most bizarre and wonderful salads EVER (okay, there's mac and cheese and some orange slices in here too), and with a drink, it cost just under $8.   Word to the wise: My roommate taught me the clever trick of getting a to-go container. Cram as much shit in there as possible and try to shut the lid. Theory is this: You probably couldn't eat it all in one sitting, but you can refrigerate it, so you could squeeze 2 meals out of it. Eating there promises a fat belly, but no to-go.

Another "here I am, thanking you for this later" review that would make my mom absolutely pleased as punch to see.  The education is unmatched, the teachers are passionate, and I am so very proud of my vocabulary.  I didn't make any "lasting friendships" and I'm not really one to take advantage of nepotism, so I don't foresee any incredible networking opportunities stemming from my high school education, but I really got to experience some wonderful things at an appropriate age.  The most important factor of my education here was the integrated empowerment. This comes innately with most same-sex educations, but Xavier really encourages the girls to become strong women.  If I do have kids in the Phoenix area, they will go either here or to Brophy.

Sonora is wonderfully average.  You will never be surprised by anything here, as when they tell you the beer won't be cold because it's casket, it won't be cold. The hot wings are hot, the fresh salads are fresh, and they always cook things to order and are always accurate (mid rare is always mid rare... a rarity!). I love brewhouses so the local brews are delish.  There's nothing surprisingly good at Sonora, but I'll choose it over a culinary adventure almost anyday!

This review was really tough for me because everything about this place sucks except for one sandwich.  And here's the thing about that.  THIS SANDWICH IS LIKE JESUS.  It could be the most amazing thing I've ever tasted. I crave it fortnightly, no joke.   Don't try the pizza and stay awaaaaaaay from the calzones. Try the Bronx Bomber. I swear to god you will probably scream some incredibly inappropriate exaltation after your first bite, that is, if you don't just lose all faculties and crap your pants right there in the shop.  Yeah, I'm pretty crazy about it.

**WARNING: REVIEW PARTIALLY BASED ON BITTER GIRL SYNDROME** (you've been warned)  See, I don't really like this place.  Ok, maybe it's because the meal was planned around a gruesome and undue breakup, during which I cried into my soup and everything became tasteless, but THAT IS NOT MY FAULT. It's not my fault I can be simply too awesome for some to comprehend.  Moving on.  I tried it again sans ridiculous relationship errors (that's you, Isaac*!) and I, quite frankly, remain unimpressed. The pad thai is eh, and the soup I revisited was simply as bland as I remember, but without the enduring emotional frustration this time.  *names have been changed to protect your stupid identity. Maybe not. Haha.

Before my sparkly new Honda Element SC, I was eternally betrothed (guess not!) to Volvo wagons (Volvo XC remains my dream car... I'm an incredible bore in real life, I promise).  Both of which had this funny habit of breaking all the goddamn time, surely not because of my penchant for not only playing tag with shopping carts in my college days but also the whole speeding and driving recklessly thing. So, needless to say, I spent a lot of time here.  They do a great job (as in, I never had to repair the same thing twice), were honest ("Look, your car's falling apart. Period. The most we can do is slap some silicon on it and charge you $5 for the trouble."), and charged a fair price.   I highly recommend for Volvo nuts like myself.

This was probably one of the worst mistakes I've ever undertaken, and I'm including that apartment in the ghetto I signed a lease for because it was "quaint" and multiple men I really shouldn't have given as much of a chance as I did.  Boyfriend and I thought we'd relive our childhood involving Pancho's from when we lived in North Phoenix and went to the one by Metrocenter. I had a birthday party at that one, and my party went to see Buffy the Vampire Slayer before eating (I'm talkin' Kristy Swanson here... yeah, totally super sweet). We both recalled fond memories of raising the little Mexican flag to get sopapillas.  Walking in, and seeing that margaritas are not served as they should be, it was the ultimate in regret.   me: "Let's just go to Arriba. They don't have margs here, and that's really the only reason I wanted Mexican." man: "Oh, come on. Where's your sense of adventure? I think I'll have a beer. (seeing look of disappointment on my face) Ohhhhkay, do you want to go to Arriba? me: (downtrodden) No, I guess we'll stay here.  We exit the line, $20 lighter, and find a seat. This place is filthy. The server, who calls me "mija" at least 18 times, I find delightful for the first time she says it. Then I hear her saying it to all of the other females at her tables. Cheating bitch. The extensive salsa line looks awesome, and I perk up a little, like, maybe this won't be so bad.  WRONG. WRONG. WRONG.  It WAS bad. Everything was bad. The half naked children screaming, the white people everywhere thinking this is the bees knees of Mexican cuisine... it all adds up to probably the worst dining experience I have ever had. We promptly went to Arriba and drank a marg very quickly to forget about the pain.

Coup Des Tartes is a particularly romantic place, although I've never been here with someone I had even the most remote romantic thoughts about. Isn't that funny? What's funnier is that I went here with some guy I married for our wedding night dinner! Ha-ha!*  The food is very delicious and the women that work here are uncontrollably adorable, always. It's a little dream of a house and takes you a bit out of the city when you're here.  *Back story: I married some Bulgarian so he could get citizenship. It didn't work out, so we are D-I-V-O-R-C-E-D. At the ripe young age of 24, too! My grandkids are going to have a field day with me.

I was really excited about Moto, so my Mom and I checked it out.  Bleh.   The sushi was just not good... not like stinky-ew-terrible, but mediocre. Our server was pretty young and confused about the whole serving profession.  I give it two stars because I can see myself cruising to the bar for a midday beer and chowing down on some edamame, as it's a really neat area.

I love DV. It's right behind the Pier 1, next to Sub Factory. Yes, the nail techs will talk shit about you in their native tongue, but there are 2 techs I never stray from: there's the hot scrappy one with the bad teeth who always wears really cute heels, and then there's Tina, the most awesome nail tech ever. Don't let the anglicized name fool you, she hardly understands a word you're saying, other than the basics, so I don't have to do the small talk thing. I can just zone and enjoy. I love Tina!  Also, this place is way cheap.

Aw, man. I just love this place.  I can think of about a million different places to have a marg, but the gigantron ones they make here are good. The funny thing about 'em is that, yes, they're pre-mixed, and yes, they're made with el cheapo brand tequila, but hot diggety... can you refuse THAT many ounces of deliciousness for 4.95 on a Friday? Not me. The bean dip is awesome, the food is so so, but as far as I'm concerned, there is no other way to avoid Camelback rush hour than by stopping at Arriba for a marg or five (and then calling a taxi home... right?).

Oh this place is wonderful. I feel this way because I am an awful cook but I love eating at home. That said, I am notorious for bringing food home and dishing it out on plates and having a go at it like that.  Well, this is like that, only it's someone else's kitchen. Nothing impressive at all, it's even mildly questionable at times, but the food is so darn good. Bringing the wine and cracking it open, sitting in the plastic bistro chairs, flip flops and a tshirt... eating 4 star italian food. It's really awesome. I've ended a relationship here, and it was the most comfortable public breakup I've ever experienced. Try the gnocchi.

I'm very firm with my belief that food can only do so much for a restaurant. Shitty service means a shitty review, in my opinion. I agree with both reviews prior to mine, but they should have received way below 4 for it. There are plenty of wonderful French places (Coup des Tartes, Sophie's Bistro) and much better cheese and wine places (Cheuvront), so why waste your time dealing with these asses? Serious. The food is fine, but the service leaves an awful taste.

They really have done a spectacular job with the remodel- they put the luxury back into luxury shopping. The handbag arcade looks so fresh and elegant! I like the cosmetics expansion, and I also dig the mega-mega jewelry section.   If I could only figure out how to make a few boatloads of cash to purchase some of these wonderfully marketed objects, it would surely be retail heaven.

This is a perfect little quiet lunch spot. Its interior is a bit tacky, but the food is darn delicious. The soups are hearty and obviously homemade. I had the Santa Fe Chicken. It wasn't awesome, but I think I ordered the wrong thing. The "avocado" was runny, like a mix, but the chicken itself was tender and yummy. The french fries were as homemade as it gets, as was the ranch dressing (there, I said it, I'm a glutton for fries dipped in ranch... this is why I will never diet).  Linda's is simple diner cuisine, but it's actually homestyle, and you can taste it!

As if dentist/oral surgeon visits weren't bad enough, this place is AWFUL.   I had to go here to have the rest of my wisdom tooth extractions because they were heavily impacted and needed surgery, which my regular (and awesome) dentist, Dr. Steen, could not perform.  First, imagine what you'd like a surgical center's office staff to be like. Sure, clinical, because they do the same thing every day. But how about professional? Professional would be nice. It was awful from the get-go. The front office lady looked very un-washed and her makeup looked a few days old. No "Hello" "How are you" or "How may I assist you", she just looked at us when we walked in and waited for us to say something. Then, "Sign in".   There were some problems with payment and she not only was unbudging, she was straight up snooty about it. She actually asked if I wanted to remove the anesthesia to bring the cost down.  UM, I'M GETTING ORAL SURGERY HERE, LADY. SOME DOCTOR IS GOING TO BE DRILLING INTO MY FACE AND SPATTERING BLOOD EVERYWHERE. I THINK I'LL KEEP THE ANESTHESIA.   Do I look like the guy from A Million Little Pieces?  The doctor himself was very arrogant and Tom Cruise-esque in Cocktail, rolled up sleeves and all. He had the audacity to call my other doctor (Dr. Steen, great guy, very gentle) names because my recovery time was longer. "Yeah, I'm really good at this, so it'll take ten minutes, tops. And you'll barely have any residual pain." Look where I am now, Dr. Day! At the same pain levels as when I was with Dr. Steen. Ass.   Dr. Day's little nurse techs strapped me down in the chair and started talking about another tech rather disparagingly, as if I wasn't there. Helloooo, I'm about 6 inches from your face and am not yet sedated. Could you hold off on the shop talk until I'm off in dreamy dream land? Kthx.  I would suggest you ask for a different referral if your dentist's office tries to send you here. Dr. Day and his staff are competent at best, but so rude and unprofessional, I'd rather go to Mexico than have anything else here.

Wow, I think this is probably the filthiest gym I've ever been to. I guess I'm charmed in that respect, as not only all other reviewers have mentioned its marginal cleanliness, but I was given the EXTREME narrow eyes by my gym partner for mentioning it. We used a really fun machine (the ONLY saving grace of this gym) that kicks ass, literally, and the first thing I noticed was that the foot pads had major dirt and grime buildup... yuck. Made me wonder the last time someone went through there with a little 409. The shower and locker room facilities were ridiculously dated, and perhaps even more annoying than any of these factors combined was the relentless and shameless advertisements everywhere. Tanning booths, vitamins, massage, towels? Jesus Christ, someone just get me to the YMCA!

Great for odd juices and European treats. Their salads are top notch and the baked goods are delish. It's just always so darn crowded in there and it's hard to get the attention of the sometimes flippant counter staff. Great people watching. I don't see how this place has been voted good for groups, unless they're ordering out?

I really enjoy Postino. It's so comfortable and a real class act. Of course the wines are delish, the crowd is hip, and the food is yum. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is solely because there's practically no reason for me to go here, which may be my own damn fault for being a relative homebody given my employment (concierge). I wouldn't go here for an after-shift glass of wine, just because I know it will be swamped. And especially if I'm alone I will avoid this place. And if I'm looking for romance, well, the packed thing nixes that idea and they don't take reservations. I would suggest this place, however, for cougars and other single types.

Wally's is fab. The decoration is like a classy den with some memorabilia and Americana, but nothing overbearing or tacky. Very casual and convenient, the bartenders are very friendly, and the place is seemingly run by people all very comfortable and familiar with each other (something I really like). Great beers on tap, some super wines, and the food is above average (lots of variety... think Village Tavern with an edge). It's popular with Arcadia residents, but is still politely tucked away, so you rarely have to worry about the crowds. They also stay open until everyone leaves, so getting a big party in late may not be a problem.

Taylor's is a consistently wonderful place for breakfast... probably my favorite. The mimosas are more champagny than juice-y, which I obviously enjoy. The servers have always been sufficient, if not friendly and kind. There's not a single thing I dislike about Taylor's, really. Even the children that are occasionally scattered about seem well-behaved. Maybe this is Stepford breakfast, who knows.

They really do a great job, and you will really pay for it. I don't have incredibly pricey clothing, so getting my $50 blouses dry cleaned here just doesn't make sense- but I would absolutely trust them with very important articles (nice sport coats, lined trousers, wedding gowns, blood soaked mattresses... haha, kidding).

You know, bowling alleys are pretty gnarly regardless of the location, but I was SHOCKED at how amazingly clean and, dare I say, classy this joint is (for a bowling alley, natch). Even the bathroom's were sparkly and lacked that tell-tale urine smell that I am seriously over-assaulted with (I think 5% of my reviews have some sort of urine association. It's on attack).   I particularly enjoy watching a grown man say on his walkie-talkie "Yeah, we have a ball problem that needs addressing, over."  Yes, yes we do have a ball problem.

Before writing this, I had it all planned out in my head. First sentence: "I can't believe I actually went here and am admitting it" but it's obviously a popular spot for yelpers. Crazy.  My mom and dad suckered me into meeting them here and it's kind of awful and agreeably Americanized Chinese food. My parents just love this place and think it's the best Chinese in town*.  Everything tasted totally "off"... even the fried rice, which quizzically had none of the ingredients I'm used to it having. The water tasted dirty and I saw 2 NASCAR t-shirts while I was here (these set my "check engine" light on immediately).   *This both confuses and comforts me... I can finally put to rest dreams of my parents reverting back to their free-wheeling, adventurous, hippie personality types they once graced this world with. They are now Bush-loving Republicans, and I am... okay with this. Breathe, Norma.

I have shared many an awful, hungover morning with my favorite stars from the Gay Corridor. The service can be on the scary tweaker side, but it's a good, simple breakfast that doesn't stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness. They've also many different healthy options, not that I've ever done more than glance at those, but it's wonderful nonetheless. It's the crown and glory of Park Central, and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place, as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea.

I can't think of an easier bar to go to. It always has a bizarre-if-nothing-else kind of crowd and the extensive scotch list is great for an adventure. It's also a great place to bike to if you live in the hood. The bartenders remember names in a cheers-esque manner and are quick with your next drink. Also, they leave you the hell alone if you're knee deep in conversation.   Minus a star because of both bathrooms smelling of a variety of bodily functions generally displeasing to the olfactory functions.

I remember driving down the alley a while ago and passing a garbage can with a rather sophomoric retort to the restaurant's quickly declining food quality. While callow, I admit to having giggled and nodding. Accurate, in a sense, that the phrase was "Puke Bread". Basically, yeah.   I am somewhat biased, as I did work there for a bit, but in this particular scenario, I feel I can identify what other reviewers have noted in regards to the service.   Just so you know, yes, the servers are nonplussed about you being there. No, they don't actually like the food, and chances are, they have a different manager than they had the week before.  So, why two stars you ask? Have you SEEN the martinis? Whew. Worth my $10.

This Y is just great. Friendly, young staff, who are mostly volunteers, great mix of people, AWESOME machines, and just labyrinthian in design, which makes for great fun and added fitness (and totally Escher-esque at times... did I just go down the up-stairs?). Another kind of strange but cool thing about it is that I always have pleasantries with other gym goers, like, hello, goodbye, please, thank you, have a great day. It sounds average, but it's like the people that go there are on the same respectful, polite page. It's gym utopia.   The only downsides are the small, 4 lane pool (but at least it HAS a pool) and the pain in the ass it is to get there because of light rail construction. Both of these are so marginal, though, so I give it a very solid 5 stars.

I always get the same thing at Eri-b's, Fili-b's, et cetera, and I've learned my lesson. This is the only one that make my burro as delish as it is.   Potatoes, cheese, and guacamole.  I know, carbfest 2007, but it's just amazing.  They use some gelatinous guac, which we won't talk about, but the taters are freakin french fries! It's not even really that Mexican?! It's a great choice, and the cheese is beautifully greasy. The guys handing you your food are almost always stoned, so they know a good burrito when they're making it.  The "salsa" is also top notch, verde and red sauce.  They only get 4 because of the regret I feel in the AM.

So I guess if I enjoyed live music and DJ's more (my man works with things like this for a living, so you could say I'm burnt out), I may have been able to disregard how godawful half the place smells. It's like a big urinal punch to the nose, and it sucks, big time. The bartenders are sometimes repulsive but always more repulsed by your presence without cause. It's almost like how Emerald Lounge was, but at least there, you kinda really did feel that you may not be worthy. This place just sucks.   And who the hell's idea was it to carpet a bar? Seriously.

I have this cat, you see, whose name is Count Larry. Only in the last month, after 1.5 years of dating, has my boyfriend come even close to garnering the same amount of affection I shower on this cat. The cat and I have been through the ringer together.   He started displaying some disgusting behavioral problems, and I thought he was angry at the the dogs, but then he added lethargy on to the top of these problems. I took him to Alta Vista, very very worried... absolutely in hysterics, thinking I was going to lose my little Larry. The doctor took a look at him and took X rays, the first of which were too "fuzzy"... she charged us for these. The second set were fine, but she said she couldn't diagnose the problem and that we could make one of two inferences from the "gray area" on the X ray:   1.) That he is going to die if not operated on or 2.) It's just a piece of poop that's stuck.  REALLY. So, basically they told me I would have to pay upwards of $600 to operate on something potentially benign, or run the risk of him dying by just paying $200 for the useless x rays and observation, with further "study" on the X Rays. Because we had limited funds and his illness didn't qualify for the CareCredit, we had to go with the latter, and kept him under close observation for the next 24 hours. They said they'd call in the next 24 hours to check up on him and to let us know what the new X Rays said.  Guess who never called?   After 7 days of badgering them about whether or not my cat was dying, they couldn't tell me anything and passed me off to eachother at least three times on every phone call.  They suck. Screw them.  UPDATE: By the way, Lar turned out to be TOTALLY FINE. After inspection of his bowel movements (totally disgusting, FYI... cats must be the smelliest creatures 2nd only to either ferrets or those monkeys that fling their own poo), turns out he just chewed a hair tie of mine and it started twisting him up a little. Nothing some kitty immodium-AD and force-watering couldn't fix.

See, all my friends but one hate this place. I always beg and plead for Mi Patio, but no one ever wants to go. The complaint is always the same, that the food tastes like soap most of the time.   And then it dawned on me.  The only other person who likes this place as much as I do usually also leaves as tanked as I do.  The $1.25 margaritas mentioned before absolutely do their trick.  Call me a boozebag, call me easily distracted, but I loooove Mi Patio.

This is where my current boyfriend took me on our first date. Now, I will say that if I was the same woman then that I am now, he would:  1. NEVER have had the opportunity to get in, near, or about my pants 2. have been slapped mercilessly 3. been the receiving end of many, many disparaging pieces of gossip (true and otherwise) via myspace as well as been the victim of prosecutable slander.  BUT, since all of 2 years has turned me into a sensitive little WASPy, corporate, salsa-making, bottle-recycling cupcake, I will review this like I felt that very first date:  "It's stinky, it's divey, it's cheap, and I don't know a goddamn person here. I LOVE THIS PLACE."

Okay, I'll start with the most important thing, but you should only take it as a negative comment if you LOVE McDonald's:  Don't go on an empty stomach. The portions are very small.  Okay, on with how great this place is. The cuisine is almost like an Iron Chef episode, where the secret ingredient is always the same: AWESOME. You are never really positive how the chef works his magic like he does, but it's so efficiently amazing that I have abandoned my love for his art and now admit to loving a CULINARY ROBOT.  It's foodie friendly, so do bring gastronomically adventurous dining partners.

Kazimierz is wonderful for dates: first, second, or millionth. It's absolutely one of my most favorite date spots (obviously) and the extensive wine list is fab. I've never tried the food. The service is always so wonderful (as seems to be the standard for the Kaz/CowCiao/SeaSaw group)... just go, it's really great.

I think the Roaring Fork is the best Southwestern restaurant in the Valley. Not only for the outstanding cuisine, but also for the service. I've never spoken to an aloof idiot hostess on the phone, ever, and that's pretty much my job description (to speak with hostesses, not to deal with idiots... I'm a concierge).   It's rich and delicious, and it happens to have the best burger in town. The bar features lots of delish micro-brews, and the service doesn't disappoint in this section, either.   I'd far prefer going here than Richardson's or Rokerij any damn day of the week.

I was last year about 2 years ago with a friend who treated me, and it's probably one of the better treats I've ever received (tangible treats, anyway. "Being Awesome" is a great intangible treat I happen to be very blessed with. Har har.).   The restaurant was a ghost town when we were there, and it sounds like a recurring issue. No clue how they stay open, but the food is out of this world. I remember going out on a limb and trying a bunch of things I wouldn't typically and making exciting new culinary discoveries. That said, Medizona does the exotic VERY well and remains the only place I will touch lamb and veal.  I'm treating the friend that took me the first time next week - I expect it will be as amazing as we remember.  Don't worry, you'll hear about it if it isn't.

RA is awful. We've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant. No serious complaints about the food, but the service is just atrocious. I admit I'm mildly addicted to the ginger dressing they use on their side salads, but the methadone for that addiction is my abhorrence for the service. I will never go back here, but I may just convince my significant other to pick me up a side salad.

$12 haircut. SERIOUS.  Who the hell cares if it's a student? They've already had a good amount of training under their belt, they're supervised, and this dollar amount includes cut, shampoo, and blow dry. (Though, I will say, my last hair dresser reminded me of many a douchebag hipster I've met in my years, but that's okay, because it's $12 effing dollars).  Pretty sure it's the best damn deal in town.

This is a great place to seal deals of all sorts. IE, if your lady isn't putting out, this is a great way to say "pretty pretty please" without actually having to grovel.   I am a lady, so, you know, I know this ploy works.  I was impressed by the whole package. There were minor setbacks that were resolved above my expectations; when we couldn't locate our waiter and asked a back server to assist, he was eager to do so. This is unusual, as any type of back service (bar back, back server, et cetera) is rarely empowered to give first-hand help and are typically instead instructed to alert the server. So this was a delightful touch.  The food was wonderful and very multi-dimensional. The wine list was extensive and the drink selection was great, too.   Great cigar selection, too!

I do like the dill. The brocolli soup bread bowl got me through many a stoned afternoon in my ASU days, and I hope it's still as good!  Once I dropped the vegetarian bull, I started ordering sandwiches here and was always delighted by the quality of the meats and cheeses and the freshness of the bread. It gets incredibly crowded  as one might expect, but that's okay. It's totally worth it.

Oh jesus their sushi is uncommonly awful. I'm somewhat proud of Arizona sushi, as it seems sushi purveyors try so hard to make people forget we're landlocked, and they often succeed. Not so here at Ichiban. They seemingly exalt our not-next-to-the-ocean situation in quality AND quantity. Not only is the fish putrid, but in the tiniest sliver portions I've seen.   Pass.

My name is Norma, and I have not reviewed Pizzeria Bianco yet.  Hi, Norma.  I've lived in the Valley for my entire life and have eaten here just under 5 times, probably. I went last night for the first time in 2 + years. It was good! I mean, I won't take the weight of the hype and so forth, because the atmosphere is incredibly charming, the service is dependable and kind, and the food is fresh, mostly local, and very handcrafted. Quite frankly, there's not much in this town that brings so much local flavor and independence to cuisine as PB does.   That said, the menu doesn't offer much variety, probably for the same reason it's the champion of slow-cooking and primarily local-based. The wine list is fantastic, and, yes, you will be waiting. So don't bring your first date, don't bring the girlfriend you're trying to get rid of, bring your homies who you can talk shit with for hours on end, because it's very possible you're looking at a 3 hour experience, 2 of which are spent outside of the restaurant.

I like Durant's out of principle, but this is by no means a great restaurant by my estimation. The three separate times I've been were riddled with lackluster service, improperly prepared seafood, and meat with the wrong temperature (medium means medium, right? or has beef fallen into the "rare is the new medium" fashion continuum?).   I remain altogether unimpressed. I would, however, hide here if the law was looking for me. It's just that kind of place.

I hate this place. It's just completely crappy Mexican food and everything I despise about the preponderance of people who honestly think they know how to run a restaurant and make authentic cuisine. It's uninspired, bland, and perfect for anyone from out of town who thinks Taco Bell is indigenous. Please. Go elsewhere. It's also dingy, the waitstaff is bored, and the margaritas are weak.

Willow House is really stinky, like garbage stinky. What's up with that?  Free wifi is cool, and the coffee is standard. AA meetings go on there, so that may be why there's that bizarre nightly influx of patrons late into the night.   The food is downright putrid, but it gets 2 stars for having survived this long, even with that godawful stink.

The butt lamps, sheep, et cetera are not tongue in cheek. It's definitely tongue out of cheek and all over someone's genitals. It's also incredibly tacky.  The valets are young punks who apparently forgot their job, but it's very Miami for them to assume the lady should open her own door. Hello? I'm paying you and tipping you for the convenience of not having to do this myself. Doubtful that "bereft of manners" was part of your qualifications in getting a position there, but whatever.  Basically, this isn't your mother's hotel, unless your mother's a filthy whore who doesn't expect much.

Fez is consistent, which is always an important factor for me. I've been here probably 20 times, with many different groups and varying degrees of inebriation (Sunday brunch drunk with the gays is the best, obv.) and the food is always fresh and delicious. It's extremely gay-centric, so I would completely advise against bringing your token Bush-loving Republican friend (old and busted: token minority friend. new hotness: token republican friend). The uhnts-uhnts-uhnts-uhnts-uhnts electro music can be awful, but enough cocktails take care of it right quick, especially here, because the bartenders are NOT shy with the booze.  Only downsides are the orange juice (out of a gun... gross) and the manager who absolutely will not make eye contact with you unless you are male, or a very convincing facsimile.

Stingray is great! Really, coming from me about a Scottsdale establishment of any kind is rather bizarre, I know, but I always have a great time, not entirely too much douchebaggery happening, and they keep their patio appropriately misted. The bar booths are way comfy, the bar stools are nice, and the appointments are great. The service has always been efficient, and the staff seems like they like working with eachother (rare, and awesome). The sushi chefs are skilled, the bartenders pour a sexy drink, and the price point isn't too high.  And, and, and... I like it.

Chelsea's is a great restaurant. Absolutely the most uncomfortable bar area ever, but the food is so incredible that I just avoid the bar entirely.   I enjoy that you won't find a Budweiser or Coors here (don't hate... I love my Bud Light poolside as much as the next red-blooded Arizona asshole, but it's a nice touch to expose those who might otherwise be unwilling to something new and delicious. Case in point: my father, a republican, Nascar-watching Miller Lite drinker, loves to have a Stella while he's here. That's saying something.). The food is wonderfully and artfully prepared, and my otherwise simple male companions always find new favorites here.   The menu features accessibly delicious meals that men won't feel emasculated ordering (the spit-roasted prime rib, dixie pan-fried chicken), but still accommodates that girly bitch who lives at 44th and Thomas, but insists she's in Arcadia (Arcadia Featured salad, Vegetarian Nut Burger).  This could be why my Chelsea's is the only place my kooky family can agree upon.

Rosie's is TROUBLE. I know this has to be my favorite bar not because I remember having good times here but because I rarely remember anything.  All stories I am about to relay are passed on the day after by a trustworthy "source" who is consistently regaled with my 3am Drunken Story Time Hour.  The roomies and I fall here "just for one" and consistently end up calling my boyfriend (aka "The Source") at half past 2 for a ride home, so it's not a crowd favorite, because he undoubtedly hates Rosie's.  OH! And there is one bartender we love in particular. After being hit on for hours by the same ridiculous wedding-ringed douchebags, one wink of the eye from Captain Awesome McBartender meant our entire tab was being taken care of by Cheaters Anon, aka those dickbags (unbeknown to said bags). It was TOTALLY AWESOME.  I also have walked in on some sex in the bathroom. Boyfriend especially enjoyed hearing me dramatize that one in great detail. I'm a hoot when I leave Rosie's, apparently.

Does it shock you that this place blows? Does it really?   Ok, let me back up, as I'm assuming that every reader is as horrified with pop culture and the way our world cultivates youth. I for one am simply primed for vomiting when viewing the primordial meat markets the likes of Scottsdale clubs foster.   But this place really takes the cake.  I'm eccentric and irreverent when it comes to decor, so the overall appearance of the place (gawdy, mostly) doesn't bother me... at all. It's really just the simple and complete brainlessness of the whole operation. The food is mediocre and the margaritas are standard. The waitstaff is commonly too busy posing and catching their reflections in the one of many shiny, distracting objects to provide any standard of service. And the management, my, are they pretty! Pretty useless!  But, I'll rip the term "doucheburger" right from Jake C. (that's awesome, by the way): this place is filled with 'em. Whom I'll bet pair nicely with the allll the cougars. (those two terms rhyme a little... try them together, I bet you'll like it.)

Shady's would be better if it weren't so awfully uncomfortable. You can't really people watch when every possible seating combination automatically puts your back to passers-by, unless you're sitting at a coveted booth in the pool room... but if you're sitting at a booth and they only seat 4-8 people, why the hell would you people-watch? And sitting in a booth when it's not crowded is somewhat polarizing, as the rest of the crowd is at the bar.   The smoking patio has the same affliction - honestly, it's a rather bizarre coincidence. I'm one of those raised-by-a-crazy-military-man types, so I hate to have my back towards the door. So, basically, I don't like chilling here. It's virtually un-chillable.  On the plus side, they have some good beers. And, back in the day when I was always on the prowl for scrawny punk rock types, this would be a safe place to meet them without having to listen to their music at deafening decibel levels.   I also agree with previous reviewers about the bartender smarminess factor, but it's a friggin' punk rock bar. Nice bartenders would just be insulting. Because we yelpers are so hardcore.

This is probably the most awful AJ's ever, strictly because of the awful Boulangerie manager and staff. They're the least genuine counter staff ever. I get being nickel-and-dimed about things, that never really bothers me. But the attitude, oh god the attitude. The incompetence is just as bad. I get the same thing, all the time. Iced honey soy latte. I give them the packets of honey, and it doesn't matter who, every. single. time, they tell me that the honey won't melt in the ice.  Think about that.  Go ahead.  I bet if we all put our thinking caps on, we could find a really wonderful solution to this problem. LIKE ADD HOT LIQUID TO MELT IT? Duh? This place is retarded. So I tell them what to do and sometimes they do it. Or sometimes they take on an air and just leave the honey solidly and complacently cemented to the bottom of the damn cup.  Oh, and they add corn syrup to the seaweed at the sushi bar. That's bad juju.

We went here for breakfast, and while the wait time was unbearable, I chalk it up to cranky hangover paranoia. The orange juice was awesome! Other notable features are how clean and comfortable the place is, the sheer deliciousness of the food, and the probability of me coming back in the near future.

Five stars, all the way. Five star staff... our server was incredibly attentive and accomodating, which is wonderful when you make the fantastically inappropriate decision to dine at a seafood restaurant with a vegetarian and a person who hates fish. She made sure we were not just happy, but ecstatic with our wine choices by bringing over various tastes from their lengthy wines by the glass list.   They graciously serve oysters (two different kinds) in any denomination, so if you're craving 'em but don't want to order a bunch (or if you really want someone to try them... and you should, the blue tips were A-MAZ-ING), you don't have to... you can just get one.  The cashew calamari was impressively tender, and no having to deal with the little baby squid guys with their tentacles and so on. It's all fresh and fileted length-wise, then battered and fried. Delish.  The servers all wear white jackets (it's an appreciated touch) and mill about quickly and efficiently. The place is so large that you sometimes forget that the other side of the wine cellar boasts a rather bustling bar. The chairs are wonderfully comfortable. The lights are high, like the designers were exalting the space and celebrating the high ceilings. The experiential fountain pillars out front are disarming, as are the textured French doors. The whale bone-esque structure over the bar is a clever design element, feeding the eastern thought that restaurants are, indeed, where you enter the belly so as to feed the belly.  I will be back here again and again.

This isn't for the experience of staying here but for the experience of working here.  I really loved my job here. I worked with incredible men who were inspired and passionate about what they do (Ben Bethel, Andre Bonhote, and William Reed). They made my job much more than a job. Despite the various downfalls the hotel experienced, they made a great leadership team who could absolutely pull it together and come out of it all ahead.  Working at the front desk is a great job for a young, creative person who wants to learn hospitality or flex their talents learned at school/other properties that wouldn't give them the creative and personality freedom they wish for. The scheduling was flexible, the job was challenging, and provided a great catapult for my career path!  As far as the property itself is concerned, it attracts a really diverse crowd; this means every day is a grab bag of emotions. One day can be alarmingly overwhelming and blood-boiling (like my first day, when we were overbooked and the guests we were getting in all had cancelled flights [very curt and beyond rude to the staff, usually]]); the next can be culturally fulfilling and flat-out honorable (like getting free tickets to the Rolling Stones or a sincere thank you from a long term guest here for brain surgery who credited his quick recovery to an incredibly attentive staff).  The Jack-of-All-Trades aspect is what made me leave, but, in retrospect, all hourly jobs end up being like that.

I want to say first that I am not only mildly obsessive compulsive, but I am my mother's daughter, making me very, very stereotypically Jewish (this is a recently common theme/disclaimer, I know) (my boyfriend is destined for sainthood... don't worry, I talked to God, he says it's cool).  This means that I am basically NEVER happy with car washes, among other things.  That said, I really like this car wash... they're just as the title says. I took my mud-bogged car there and they took so much extra time out to make sure all the mud was off and without the requisite upcharge. It wasn't an AMAZING job, but it was the kind of job Los Olivos or Weiss Guys would charge twice the price for. And, the people there were remarkably friendly.

I've been here 2 times, once alone, and once on a boyfriend-totally-messed-up-so-ordering-the-most-expensive-dish-on-the-menu-is-a-must, and I didn't like anything either time. The food was mostly bland and average, and I commented on the tomato sauce having come straight out of the Sysco can and onto my pasta. The service was sluggish, and dare I say I felt the server was hating on us for being straight? This is probably the most off-putting part of our whole experience (this also has happened countless times at Fez, but I digress). Seriously.   I think the decor's trying a little too hard to be something it most obviously is not (they should actually stick to being a neighborhood Italian joint, instead of the cheeseball fake plants and Italian "stuff" everywhere), but the oil and herbs combo at the beginning is a welcome touch and probably the only reason I'm going with 2 stars instead of 1.  Doubtful I'll be back here alone or with boyfriend.

I feel kind of badly for going against the grain, and maybe I had the cashier whose cat was run over that morning, but I felt a little off here, like, not worthy.  I did end up getting hooked on Feist thanks to the killer and easily-browsable selection, and now she's a dirty Apple sell-out! Woo hoo!

Self described as a "modern tavern", The Vig is a shining little sparkle of a bar in the middle of an otherwise unimpressive area. The space is open and comfortable, the atmosphere is upscale but casual, and the... oh, geez, I can't even think about the luxurious wood grains and summer-vacation-in-the-Hamptons furniture appointments, as I am overcome with an almost Pavlovian fixation with the fact that this place has Bocce ball as its main attraction. Pair almost any dated, archaic, or kitschy activity with alcohol and I'm pretty much useless to resistance, but Bocce pushes me almost to utter nirvana. There's no sign up sheet, and from the few times I've been here, perfect strangers are relatively eager to make Bocce alliances. If it's late enough, you may even be joined by the chef and owner, Doug, who encourages mischief on the court, including but not limited to: human obstacles, flagrant taunting, or ridiculous ball-launching methods. And the Vig's outstanding gin selection is a big sell. It almost feels like what the Merc Bar would be if it had a patio and didn't have over 10 years of spilled drinks and smoke damage. It's new, it's hot, and I hear the burgers aren't too shabby. I'm looking forward to checking out the dining menu, but until that happens, I'm left to encourage you to share in the unpretentious fun The Vig offers.

I don't mind the obviously trying-too-hard decor; find a single happening place in Phoenix/Scottsdale and try to tell me it's NOT a reasonable facsimile of NY or LA. The prices are incredibly high, though. You're looking at an Olive and Ivy experience for Mary Elaine's prices.   That said, the food is really wonderful. The fried plantains with black bean sauce is something you will try to cram down even though you're beyond full. We had the butterfish for an entree and it was unsurprisingly delicious and the most popular of the entrees. Try the sides, they're very good.  The mojitos were also quite good. And, there's a HUGE difference between their standard mojito and the 12 year. Spring the extra few bucks for it.  The patio is nice, but it's overlooking unglamorous construction and a small, unlit path between SMoCA and the Mondrian.  The design elements of the restaurant are very mismatched, from the whimsical umbrellas to the roosters everywhere, some whites were plainly mismatched, and... oh, yeah. This used to be a Doubletree. That explains the ho hum architecture.

Yup, it's actually really nice here! My behemoths always get a good sniff on here and just get exhausted. There are regulars here, too, which is kinda fun. It's like cheers, but... um, with dogs, instead of, you know, people. *ahem*  The park itself gets a 5, though I will say this:  Last time I went, some obnoxious poodle owner took her sensitive little flower of a bitch (haha, get it? It's not really profanity!!!) into the big dog run and my boxer basically treated it as he treats all others; LIKE A BOXER. The woman had the audacity to call me and my dog names, me, irresponsible, my dog a mongrel! What a bitch (ok, THAT was profanity).

First: How the hell do you yelpers remember every damned dish you ate? I have a problem remembering whether or not I wore shoes yesterday, much less the contents of my stomach. Me, short bus; you, Memory genius? I don't know.  Second, my mumsy-poo and I went here, and she's a tough nut to crack. She practically raised me on sushi and doesn't fall for the upper-upper crap that a lot of these places try to make themselves out to be. (Read: We're stereotypical Jews; we don't want to pay a lot, but we want the whole cow.)  That said, the service was a bit slow, but the woman was pretty slammed and alone in the place, so I'm only yanking one star. She was totally gracious and apologetic, and if I were rating her, she'd get a five, but the restaurant should have at least 2 servers on at lunch. Also, no ingredients for bloody marys. Wah wah.   The food, though, was AWESOME. We had the sashimi combo, and the pieces of fish were HUUUUUGE! And tasty. We also crammed down dessert and were pleasantly confused about this sweet crepe business at a sushi joint.  We're glad we went; though it was a hair expensive for the location (North Phoenix/PV Mall area isn't exactly a mecca for delicious eateries... prove me wrong, yelpers!).  Picky Jew mom digs it, so Yasu succeeds.

I'm at 4 stars with this place, and it's not the art, it's not the hipness, it's not even the beer (wipe that look of shock off your face. I may be a drunkard, but there's more to me, promise). It's the quietness and simplicity of a neighborhood bar. Lots of comfy places to sit, nothing hidden, nothing's perfect. It's a whole lot like hanging out at a fair number of friends' houses who also happen to have roving tastes in beer (or someone well-acquainted with the mix-n-match beer section at TJ's).  I dock a star because, like going to a beer snob friend's house, if I hate the music, they will just shrug and let me know all the reasons why I should give it a chance. And this is because I am an asshole who listens to nothing other than 100.7.

I really love the grounds and location, but I think the service blows and their low rates in the summer draw in a definite west side crowd. Of course, their lax pool policies attract industry freeloaders like myself, so there's a good chance that your Valley hotel staff will be well-represented poolside.  Oh, and in Phoenix terms, NOT THAT CLOSE to downtown. It's a good 15-20.

I abhor this park. I'm spoiled; we've been taking the kids to Chaparral since we foraged the audacity to let them out of the house, but still... really? This is it? It's not even a park, it's a trailhead. There have never been poop baggies stocked, and seeing another dog there is like seeing anyone with any sense of decency at Suede. Yuck. I'll stick with Chaparral.

I used to ride the bus every day in high school. I enjoy the theory, but the smell of it (you guessed it... URINE!) bugs me to no end.  Though, I give four stars for the super cool driver who gave Theresa B. and I a free ride when she busted a flat on our bike ride from PHX to Tempe for Tour de Fat this year. He got off the bus and helped us put our bikes on, too! Totally cool!

First, NO atmosphere.  After working at the Clarendon for as long as I did, I recommended Fattoush quite a few times and never heard a bad word about it. But, honestly, I rarely stray further west than 15th avenue as general practice. Lucky for me, I was broke and at the will of my paying lunch partner, and he took me here (it's Ben from the Clar, FYI... here's proof that he's as into non-chain and local joints as most of us yelpers... and we drove there in his p-i-m-pin Prius... owoooo).  We had virtually the same thing and were both very pleased with it. The humus is very, very good. Incredibly smooth and flavorful.  Lentil soup also gets incredible thumbs up.

I just recently entered the fun corporate world and with that fun corporate world comes my fun corporate benefits. Now, since I'm not reviewing my benefits, I'll spare you my opinion that HOLY SHIT I HAVE THE BEST BENEFITS EVER OMG LOL !1!1!!!11, and I'll tell you that my AWESOME new doctor directed me toward this pharmacy... because he is AWESOME.   (benefits are kind of a whole new world for me. it's a really convenient world, and I get really excited about modern conveniences, so, there's that.)  Melrose Pharmacy has the most charming layout and functions just as any CVS or Walgreen's would (except I wouldn't expect Melrose to turn down my birth control script because of the pharmacist's ethics, like our Mormon friend Walgreen's), but more charming. They also sell fun little extras, like essential oils, incense, chatchkis, and the like.   They're very friendly people, accessible and knowledgeable. I'd go there even if I didn't have a prescription!

I love the "hi" and "bye" when you enter and exit the store; not because I feel welcomed, particularly, but because I appreciate the business model and human psychology behind it*... it's a prime example of GREAT leadership and well-thought out business practices coming to fruition.   Also, there are always cops there (which I think is a great thing), it's very well-lit, and it always pretty well-stocked. I also really love the ice selection (one of which, in a certain part of Texas, is called "Snowman poop". Seriously. Denton, Texas.)  And, Thomas, it means QuikTrip. Durrrrr  *In retail, the more effort you exert in making individual, verbal contact with a customer, the less likely they are to vandalize, steal, or otherwise decrease the bottom line. Also, it increases the consumer's confidence and trust in an organization by giving a face to the relatively faceless mass that is corporate America.

I love the office staff here! There's one woman, Liz, who's incredibly comforting and understanding, never cold or short with me. Dr. Steen is also a very gentle, patient man. I pretty much freaked out about getting all my work done and he listened to and addressed all of my fun little paranoias with an eerily calm manner.   After having my work done, I've called about 18 times about different things that I think are going wrong, and everyone has been so incredibly understanding that it's hard for me not to say "I love my dentist office". And that's weird.  Almost minus a star for not providing me with the cool irrigator thingy that everyone else gets when they have their wisdom teeth pulled.

I love butcher shops and my dog. I am a vegetarian. Allow me to explain.  First, butcher shops are becoming obsolete because of grocery store meats. 5 in Phoenix? Bullshit! This is awful. If you eat meat, find yourself a butcher. The meat is better, fresher, and these people care about their meat. It's good for men to care about their meat, in all possible situations/insinuations.  Second, I am newly a vegetarian because I think farming meat is wrong. That said, I'll eat the hell out of some fresh elk that a buddy took down last weekend and butchered himself. I also eat fish that is not farmed. Most fish at this particular shop is wild caught. This is wonderful.  Third, I love LOVE my dog. Hobe is not only super serious about their meats, but they're super serious about their dogs, too. They grind and freeze their raw bones from chickens, turkeys, and cows to create raw diets for dogs, and swear by it. Individually packaged, immediately frozen, and they always have boatloads on hand. Amazing! My dog goes literally apeshit over raw food, and their ground stuff is good for his old man teeth. They are so friendly and informative.  I won't eat the meat they sell, but you can bet your beef I'll buy my dad's steaks here.

It's true, they give great discounts. They also claim to use "green" chemicals (there's the rub), so it automatically feels like you're saving the world, one monkey suit at a time. They do a professional job with a smile, and their turnaround times (even during the holidays) were impressive. These are my new cleaners!

My man and I were really pumped with basically everything about St Francis, from our really super sweet server to the ultra classy but not top-heavy, spill all over myself wine glasses (my clumsiness is legendary, to the point of serving myself wine in tumblers when I'm home). All of the glassware and other service items were pretty and perfect, actually. Notably so.  We had the carrot soup and romaine salad with buttermilk cheddar dressing for our apps. The carrot soup, amazing. The salad would be amazing anywhere else, but given how good the rest of our meal was, we found the salad relatively lacking. RELATIVELY.   For dinner, I went with the seafood cioppino and he had the strip steak with fingerlings and onion... both were definitely top shelf all the way. Full flavors, the broth in the cioppino was so, so good, and all the veggies on his steak were just perfection.  Their cocktails looked very, very tempting, but I went with my standby date night beverage and was impressed that they had all three ingredients waiting for me: St Germain, Hendricks Gin, and a cucumber slice.

Okay, I hate Walgreen's because of their stance on dispensing drugs (if the pharmacist has some religious objection to your birth control, he can refuse to dispense it. That's CRAP).   But, they're the only ones that carry the one brand of hosiery that doesn't make me stabby. So, fine. I have to go here every other week.

Bar Smith is what you'd get if you crossed the Merc Bar with a house party. The downstairs portion of the bar is swanky and low-lit, with a DJ tucked away in the corner. The crowd is young and has been infiltrated by the college types, streaming in from the new ASU dormitories about a mile away. It is a place where you'd feel encouraged to wear a collared shirt and your expensive jeans, but it is still Phoenix, so no pressure. The upstairs portion of it is really wonderful... it's open air, so in the cooler months, I imagine it will be wildly popular. Many couches and ottomans are strewn about, perfect for gathering. I'm pretty sure you're going to hate me for even mentioning this part during the most disgusting months of the year, but there's a fireplace up there, too (some time this year, your ire for this fireplace will morph into an uncontrollable urge for "cozy"... just wait).   I really like Bar Smith, and I think it's a great addition to the downtown scene; just watch your drinks.

First, I love that all glasses of wine are the same price and all bottles are the same price. This takes douchebaggy guesswork out of it, especially since I always feel pressured to take a pricier glass of pinot so my server doesn't think I'm a cheapass. I know, I'm so gullible.  Second, the food is very, very good and fresh. It doesn't have a very solid cuisine description, but I like that. Gives the place a little light-heartedness.   Yes, kind of hate the valet thing, but you don't really have a choice in this neighborhood and it's FREE. Drop the 3 bucks for tip.  The ambience is super... I love the big, open windows and the oversized lamps and pots (very Chelsea's). The colors are vibrant and warm and the whole experience is comfortable. Again, much like Chelsea's.  I love the LGO Hospitality group!

EDIT: This used to be my favorite safeway for the reasons below. They no longer have an organics aisle, so they now fail.  Original Review:   This is by and far the most spectacular Safeway...  ...EVER.  An entire organics aisle? I know it sounds rather normal for some east-coasters, but this is a real luxury for an AZ native (hey, you natives out there, remember ABCO? Yeah, I probably bagged your groceries at one point). They have some rather delish selections, great deals, and, well, let me tell you about me. There are two ways to my heart (other than the whole, you know, walking on the beach and snuggling bullshit, cause that certainly has its place, too, but I'm talking about, you know, the REALLY important stuff): cookies and wine. And they have an AWESOME selection of organic cookies (they're organic, so they're good for you, duh) and a great wine aisle too.  I will mention that this is how my current boyfriend won my heart: wine, cookies, and agreement that the 7th and Osborn Safeway is tops.

Mary Elaine's was like nothing my boyfriend and I had ever done. It's not really our style, but we had a great time, nonetheless.   The service was, of course, very good. I thought it would be too stuffy for our tastes and that I'd feel out of place, but this did not happen. As a matter of fact, after our server warmed up to us, we had a great back-and-forth... same goes for our backserver, who we came to call the Bread-Pusher, because the bread is incredibly addicting.  I had the tasting menu, and other than the rabbit, it was awesome. I didn't like the rabbit not because of how it was prepared though, I just don't like rabbit. Too cute and fuzzy.  Our server brought us some great wine pairings that were not on the menu and included what we dubbed the "adult" framboise... so delicious. It was a cherry sparkling wine  and tasted amazing with chocolate.  The whole night was opulence perfected. I will probably never eat here again (oh, except for that whole gift certificate thing) especially because it's closing, but it was fantastic and really a wonderful place to take someone if you need to either impress them or if you're apologizing for something you really, really screwed up.

I swear this place is a cover for some type of organized crime (Russian, maybe?) but hot damn if they don't have the best home fries in all of our fair land (that includes Matt's Big Breakfast... I know, right?) They always cook everything to perfection and it tastes really fresh. It's also the location of the original Mel's Diner TV show (EDIT: Korina and Pierre have brought some conflicting facts about this statement to my attention. So when I say "Really!" in the next sentence, I actually mean "Not Really!"). Really!  Okay, here's what blows: -Disgusting carpet. -Awful bathrooms -Let's just say the waitresses (all are remarkably sexy in a scrappy exotic gangster kind of way... I guess you really have to see for yourself) are less than happy to be serving you. That goes for the "busboy" who, with the way he barks at the servers and talks shit about customers, is probably the owner. Actually, this guy kind of rules. So, back to the bitchy server girls. They never wear any clothing that could possibly be misconstrued as appropriate. Always teeny tiny jeans and shirts to match. So strange. -The decor is ridiculous. It's overly patriotic. -The clientele is a mixed bag of cops (cool), tweakers (uncool... but they get booted pretty fast), grizzled old men (intimidating, but cool), and aging republicans, complete with anti-everythingelsebutamerica sentiments emblazoned across greasy shirts (SO obviously not something I like).   All in all, this place is about food and people watching. And, if you like those games where you make up stories about random passersby, you will have a field day with these people.

Pure is, unfortunately, my new sushi place. This blows because it's all the way out in the boonies, for chrissakes. It's on, like, 923875987235th street and Hayden (no offense, Kristen.).  So, there's that. BUT! They are expanding to Old Town, which only puts them 4 light years away from me, as opposed to 17. Woo-hoo!  I'm complainy right now because of all the boozy bowling last night with you yelpers, FYI.  At any rate, try the Veggie Tempura... it's absolutely out of this world dreamy. It's very light, and they don't deep fry the whole veggie, they actually julienne everything, make it into little birds nest thingies, then fry it. They also add a clump of mashed daikon sprouts to the tempura so you can digest the oil better.   Our server, Jenna, was just AWESOME and gave us some great pointers on the more uncommon effects of Sea Urchin. Hooray for aphrodisiacs. We also had this lobster roll thing with a sweet cream and tempura lobster. SO GOOD.  The prices were really great, I thought. Less pricey than Stingray.  Jew mom also gave it big thumbs up!

Ok, ok, ok... so Ben is pretty much my best friend and I have worked for him at the Clarendon for a good portion of my life, but his past restaurants have definitely been hit-and-miss (to say the very least). C4 had a good thing going with the unique flair, but honest-to-god, Clarendon Kitchen ROCKS.  I will say this, too. When visiting, another friend asked Ben where we would eat when I was here. I'm so brutal on him and his work that he told the other person that he'd rather keep his soul intact than let me tear another of his restaurants apart. True story.  C4 was imaginative. Camus was a pretty scam. Clarendon Kitchen really does freaking rock. The chimichanga was intense, the guacamole incredible, and the chips nice and fresh. The copious margarita consumption and subsequent heartburn are honest testaments to the truthfulness of their recipe.  Lalo's art is totally at home here, too.   Love, love, love.

I checked Cien Agaves out with a coworker last night and we LOVED IT. First things first: everything tastes very fresh. The salsas and chips were great, and we tried the cucumber margarita, prickly pear margarita, and the habanero marg, and they were all good, made with the veg/fruit/pepper FRESH.  We just had nachos but they were plentiful and mighty tasty. Big fat slices of jalapenos on top and visually appealing.   The ambience isn't uniform in places (mixing early 90's modern furniture with homestyle Mexican decor and art), but it's just subtle enough to not be incredibly annoying. The male staff were very cool and relaxed, but the females were a little bit "in the way"... eavesdropping, it seems. We were one of 2 couples in the bar, though...  Regardless, this place deserves 5 stars. It's a very delicious, very easy Mexican choice in downtown Scottsdale.

Okay, the food, if not able to feed entire armies, is on the delicious side, but unimaginative. They give fancy names to tired dishes, and the menu is as big as the portions.  The service: Did they purchase their waiters from a vending machine?  I wanted a dish that had fried tofu. When I asked if I could have the tofu steamed instead, the server's expression was quizzical to say the least, and she then tried to illicit a description of this "steaming" method. Or did she not know what tofu is? Silly. She then had to crawl through a chain of command, from chef to manager, to make it happen. Hello? You have about 9000 dishes on your menu; I'm sure SOMEONE asks for a substitution SOMEWHERE?  All in all, I remain unimpressed. More like the Grand Sucks Cafe.

Ahhh, Phoenix winters. Just nice enough to justify buying entire lots of "light sweaters" and just cold enough to give me a cold every two weeks from wearing said sweaters.  Winter, my weakened immune system and I commend you.

We woke up to poo in the tub, so I called these guys at 8:00am... they were here by 8:45 and had the problem fixed by 9:40. The gentleman who came out, Paul, was just incredibly nice and patient with us (imagine: 2 twenty something females who discover this atrocity after the responsible men have left the house, both with pending shower/faucet concerns, and completely dumbfounded with plumbing jargon. Needless to say, we were probably the dumb part of his day).  What's even better was that when I called (I read great reviews of them on kudzu.com... do yelpers never have plumbing problems?), the guy on the other end outlined the exact process, saying they would identify the problem, inform me what was happening and what needed to take place, give me an EXACT dollar amount, and then I could determine whether or not I would like the service performed. No guess work, whatsoever.   Paul did all these things, gave me a good quote, and was speedy. He even tolerated my gremlin monster dogs jumping up on him.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BUSINESS! It's not very frequently you find a good, trustworthy plumber.

I came here for their friends and family event, and while I typically wouldn't write about it since it was virtually gratis and it is their start-up week, I didn't even see potential in this place (I went to Bourbon Steakhouse for a similar type of gratis event, and it fucking rocked... I refuse to review them yet because I know I'll be back when they will actually be in operation). As a matter of fact, the only recurring thought I could muster during the entire meal (which, mind you, lasted just under 3 hours) was:  What the hell?  First bad experience here: sitting on the toilet, as a 5'9" woman, my feet were dangling. Bizarre. And the stalls are very looney-bin-esque... sterling silver from top to bottom with no obvious ventilation or way out if someone locks you in (yes, paranoid is the word you're searching for).   Second: The chairs are beyond uncomfortable, but wouldn't be so awful if I hadn't had to endure such a long-lasting meal (note to restaurants: this long-lasting concept? Good for relationships and, like, gum. Not so much for supper).  Third: I've had better food at pretty much anywhere that charges even a fraction of what this place does. It was kind of outrageous, but I didn't begin a violent rampage because, as mentioned, they were buying.  Four: Our wait time in between dishes averaged at about 15 minutes from picking up the dirty plates to dropping new ones. This isn't accounting for how long it took for them to clear our table, despite the 9842759873 servers, bussers, sommeliers, and bartenders milling around (I'm not even counting the armada of hostesses).   I can see many a Scottsdale douchebag or Eurotrash enjoying this place, but it's probably because (pardon me for being caustic) they haven't recovered their taste buds from last night's coke binge.  Sidenote: Our server was awesome. That said, he'll probably find something better very shortly.

We LOOOOOOVE this steakhouse. The service isn't over the top like I'd expect, but I really do love the steaks. It's so tender and wonderful, and absolutely the most fabulous presentation... the plates are pre-warmed, and OH! the bread and ohmygodit'sjustsoeffinggood...  I just exploded a little. You get the picture.

The location is very unassuming, but the Chai is AWESOME! I typically hate ginger, but the thai has this great gingery scent and a little bit of the kick. It makes a great beverage meal, as it's incredibly complex and filling.   The hummus is rather good too.  Fie on the restaurant portion (and minus a star) for the lack of vegetarian friendly options.

Now, I've made the mistake of reviewing before completion of services (See: Showcase Honda), but, like my dogs, I just don't learn and am a big fat smooshy dumb head face who chewed up mommy's expensive shoes this morning and drives mommy CRA-AZY.  Anyway.  Here it is: Yeah, the salesgirl who helped me out was a big time Valley Girl and her name was Chanel and her makeup was quite possibly airbrushed, but she was really freaking cool.  She understood and commiserated with me on the following topics:  -being miserably and uncomfortably blind -the over-the-top prices of these silly designers -having to work weekends -the silliness of our respective boyfriends not getting that we have to SEE, dammit, as in the necessity of rent pales in comparison to the obvious importance of me being able to accurately but silently judge those around me based on how I can SEE their personal appearance  So, that said, the place is overpriced, but it's at the Waterfront, so whaddya want? Also, my insurance gives me some good discounts for going here, so we'll see. I have an appointment with the good doc today to tell me just how blind I am, which, if it goes to hell, you'll hear about it.

Hate to say it, but I totally love F+E. The prices are great, there's plenty of sale stuff to keep my recipes interesting, and I like the all self-serve checkout for when I don't really want to chat over my wine + ice cream + tampon purchase (How's my day? I menstruate. It's terrible. That's how my fucking day is.).   Um, yeah. TMI? Maybe. Just go here. It's great.

Deceptively fantastic. Like Lady Gaga. Pizza A Metro is the Lady Gaga of mid-range Italian restaurants.  It's so unassuming from the outside that I was pumped when pulling up. Oh, man, Ben, we could get in a knife fight at a location like this! Sweeet!  It's not that bad. But the food is righteous. The pre-meal bread with the tomato + balsamic + red onion deliciousness was such a great alternative to the typical bread and oil. We split the antipasti (yes, the portions are comically large... we maybe cleared a layer (a delicious, delicious layer) of very fresh, yummy artichoke hearts, prosciutto wrapped canteloupe, and a smattering of other favorites. We then had the pizza with sausage and broccoli. Perfect cheese, perfect crust, yum sausage, perfectly crunchy fresh broccoli.  It's clean and warm on the inside. Try it. You like it. And tell no one that I mentioned liking Lady Gaga.

Ben B. and I visited Al-Hana after a tiresome IKEA outing and BABA-GODDAMN this stuff is YUMMY AS HELL. We nearly stuffed ourselves to capacity on the smoky babaganoush and hummus. We had the chicken shawarma and Ben had something with spiced beef in it... the name lasted on my tongue about as long as the food, can't remember it, so sorry.  Nothing over 3.99. Seriously. You must.

How is it that no fellow yelper has been here? This place is rigoddamndiculously awesome. Such a wonderful atmosphere, top notch date night place. TRY THE SPECIALS, especially the calamari. Really, you must. They don't fry it, it's just fresh calamari grilled to moist perfection with a light oil drizzling on top. You haven't actually tasted calamari with all that battered crap... this is the real deal. It's definitely regional, most dishes served with fish. The service is warm and accommodating, and on the weekends, they have a freaking accordion player.  Go, you'll really enjoy.

I don't know. It's okay, but I don't think it's anything special. I like shopping local like the next Gen Y kombucha drinking rescue dog owner, but the prices are too high, the layout isn't cohesive, and it's cramped and tiny. It's bodega meets whole foods, and that's cool and all, and I hope it stays open and busy, but... but, I guess I'm cool with my TJ's/AJ's/WF circuit I'm currently stringing on.
