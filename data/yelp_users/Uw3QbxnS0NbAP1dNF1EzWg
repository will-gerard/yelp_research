I'd have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in this one. After reading the great reviews I thought this would be a great place to drop by this afternoon after school. I called and found that the price for a gel manicure was very cheap and with that and the great reviews, I was in! The technician was very nice, but that's probably the only other good thing that I will say about this place. First off it was dirty, not the station where my nails were done but around it. The molding on the walls and dry wall had holes in it. It looked very run down. Also, the selection of gel polish colors was dismal. Very dismal. They did not have the color that I was looking for (which, I understand is a standard OPI color carried everywhere) so I opted for clear. She cleaned up my cuticles alright, but left quite a little bit to be clipped off. But here comes my REAL issue. Filing. The filing job on my nails was so incredibly sloppy. It left them jagged, uneven, rough, and dirty. I did not notice this at first because I was just relaxing and the place itself was very dark. She applied the polish and I left. Looking at my nails after, the polish was also uneven and painted off of my nail and onto my finger. I actually had to stop by Walgreens and get a nail file and FIX my freshly done nails. I guess you really get what you pay for, which is a real shame. Next time I will stick with my usual place and pay a little more so that I know it will be done right the first time!

Amazing food and beer! This is a great place to go for dinner, a date, or just a night out with friends. It's always packed so you need to park a little far away, but it's worth it.

I know it' s  not the fanciest sushi, but it's really great for what it is! I've never had a bad roll, and there is always great service. Their prices are reasonable, and their happy hour prices are simply the BEST. I really like the atmosphere and I feel comfortable coming here all dressed up or in a tee and yoga pants. Definitely my pick for an early dinner or late lunch in Tempe!

Best sandwiches and subs in Tempe. Don't wate your money at Subway or anywhere else, this place is awesome. All of their locations are warm, welcoming, friendly, and fun. And their theme is so funny, who thinks of a marijuana themed sub shop? They do. I love the names of all of the creative sandwiches.  If you have the munchies (you know what I'm talking about) go here!

I love this place. The food is great and the staff is really friendly. The only problem with it is that it is always SO busy. Which I see as a good sign, but still a little annoying. Overall the best place to get breakfast or brunch in town. The waitresses are all cute too.

I had no idea this place existed until I was searching for a place while driving around late at night. There they were, all lit up. I walked in and the guy was super friendly, pizza was quick. I ordered the greek, and it's delicious!

Yummy soups and sandwiches. Almost reminds me of a Panera Bread (For those of you from the East coast). Came here for lunch one day and the food was ready quickly. Very pleased with everything. I would definitely go here again.

Okay.  So I've been going here two years now. It was always speedy delivery, good food, and good service. But lately, in the last few months, the staff has changed. Delivery takes forever and the food is not nearly as good as it used to be. Food will be cold when delivered too. The only person I still recognize is the short delivery guy with the glasses. He's nice. The others, all kind of weird. This place is overrun with hipsters, it's like a den. Normally I wouldn't care but the quality of this place and it's service has gone down since. I'll be trying new Chinese restaurants from now on.

We ordered from Otto for dinner today, and I'd have to say that I am pleasantly surprised. The delivery was quick (they said they would be here in 30 and made it in 22 minutes), and the pizza was still warm. I like the crust, it's nice and fluffy but still crispy. The delivery guy was nice as well! Only giving four star right now because this is our first time ordering from here.

Been going here for years. Wasn't so great a while back, but has improved greatly! The girls are always friendly and helpful, and the salon is impeccably clean.

I went here when I had the flu because I needed take out. I ordered it before I left the house late and took much longer than I had anticipated to get there. I got there and they were super friendly, and the food was still piping hot! I got the chicken pho and it was delicious. My only complaint is that they should use white meat in it rather than dark meat, but it was still yummy. I'll be coming back again!

I came here for a gel manicure and to get my gel polish removed and redone. I made an appointment and showed up on time. It took another 15 minutes for them to be ready. I specifically requested a color, which I knew they had and the girl insisted on using another-- saying it was the same. I obliged because I figured she knew what she was talking about. The manicure was sloppy and rushed and she was on the phone THE WHOLE TIME. Not only did the polish look terrible, sloppy, and uneven when done, she drilled my nails down painfully and now they are extremely thin and hurt without polish on. The manicure began to chip within 3 hours of having it done. I called and they said that I could come back to get it redone. When I did I was passed between 4 nail technicians who did not seem pleased that I had come back. I will NOT be returning here and I feel like I have wasted my time and money. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone.

I've been searching for the perfect salon since I moved to Tempe three years ago. I've had a lot of ups and downs with bad haircuts and bleach bleeding between foils. I've paid way too much and gotten bad dye jobs. Today I went for my first appointment at Altered Ego. I was assigned Nique and couldn't be happier. She did a wonderful job on my hair, I got a full head of highlights. The price was low, and certainly within my small budget. But you get way more than you'd expect with such a great price. I won't be going anywhere else from now on, and certainly will be sticking with her as my colorist. This place is cute and friendly, and I definitely recommend it to anyone!

I've been here twice and just simply love it. My first time coming here was random, I had originally intended to go to Oregano's but when their wait was over an hour, I figured "Hey, why not?". Best decision ever. Their food is delicious and fresh, and the service is great. The prices aren't the cheapest, but it's certainly not expensive. I love the outdoor patio! I would recommend their guacamole (drizzled with agave syrup!), fish tacos, and the sangria. I will definitely keep coming back!  The only reason this isn't 5 stars, is because I've only been here a coupe of times. Will update the more I go.

Convenient! Close to home! Lots of groceries! And spoiled milk. Went here a few times because of the convenient location. It's kind of "ghetto", but I got over it- they have a variety of things. But really, the gallon of milk I paid $4 for was very very spoiled. Spoiled to the point of food handling negligence, as the expiration date was fine. The store, or their vendors need to take a lesson in food handling, or they will make many more people sick. I will no longer be trusting the food here. I'll be driving the extra mile and a half to Safeway from now on. What a shame :(

Dr. Macri is wonderful! After suffering from severe and chronic back pain for about 5 years, I was recommended to her. After the first adjustment, my back pain was improved greatly. Now, after only a few treatments I am almost pain free. My quality of life has greatly improved because of Dr. Macri. Not only is she knowledgeable, but she also spends time with her patients and gets to know them. No 5 minute rushed appointments here. Highly recommended!!

This is a great place to go for lunch, dinner, or take out. I've always been pleased with the food that I have gotten, though the level of spicy varies from day to day. The prices are a little high for what it is but all in all it's great food all around. This has been my usual Thai place for a while and will probably continue to be until I find something better. Also, the Tom Kha is to die for.

I really love this place. It's small, it's clean, and it's delicious. The prices are very reasonable and you can find their coupons EVERYWHERE (at least in all of the local coupon books) My favorite is the buffalo chicken pita or the falafel and hummus. Whatever that lemon sauce is, I could eat a bucket of it. It is SO good. Their delivery is always within a reasonable time, and they deliver very late! Love love this place. Actually, I want to go there for lunch right now!

This is my new favorite place! I come here every two weeks, and will continue to do so. The staff is so friendly and welcoming, they really make you feel comfortable and welcome in their salon. I'm pretty sure it is family owned, which is great! The staff is small, but I like that. It's just enough to handle their customer flow. I have rarely had to wait when I get there, and 90% of the time, I just walk in. As soon as you sit down, you are offered a cold bottle of water. I would have to say that the gel manicures and their pedicures are as good as it gets in this town. They are thorough and do a fantastic job. (I got a pedicure the other day and she was the most thorough on my cuticles as I have ever seen, it was amazing) The staff always takes their time to ensure that they are doing a good job, I never feel rushed out of there or like they have hurried and done a mediocre job. The salon is clean and cute, with great air flow. The polish color selection is small, but they more than make up for it in everything else! I love this place!

I was in the neighborhood and figured that I would give this place a try. I walked in at 2:00pm and asked for a pedicure. I was asked to sign in and pick a color, which I happily did. About five minutes later I was called back to a pedicure chair, sat back, and put my feet in the water. That was 30 minutes ago. I'm still sitting here, the water is now cold, and I have been completely ignored. No one told me that there would be a wait, and no one has acknowledged the fact that I'm just sitting here waiting patiently. I wouldn't have a problem if I was actually TOLD that the wait was 30 minutes. But, this tricky business of putting me in a chair with my feet wet and not letting me know is unacceptable. I get that they didn't want to lose a customer because of a 30 minute wait, but literally tricking me into staying is unprofessional and I won't be coming back. 40 minutes in now and someone JUST told me they would be right with me. What the heck? I don't appreciate having my time wasted like this. I'm disappointed because I saw all of these great reviews and wanted to try it for myself. This better be one hell of a pedicure.   50 minutes in and one foot has barely been touched. The tech just got up and started doing other tasks and I'm just sitting here. What the heck. She just went to check her phone.  As soon as she gets to me she stops and does something else. Not okay :(

Just called to place an order for delivery and asked for a moment to pick out a pizza topping. Immediately the man on the phone said "I'm sorry, I don't have time for that." and hung up. When I called back he said, "I don't have time" and hung up the phone-- AGAIN! Could be the best pizza in the world, but your company just lost our business. Thanks for treating us like such valued customers. Your manager will be hearing from us.

I usually love Oliveo. I've been eating from Oliveo Grill for years now. But I ordered my pizza over an hour ago and I am still waiting for it. It better not be cold...  Edit: They said they were on their way 15 minutes ago.  Edit: Got the pizza, it was cold. They won't give us our money back.

I love this place. The location is great because it's right down the street from my house. The staff is always friendly and they greet you as soon as you walk through the door. I've always done walk ins here and have never had to wait. There is a nice relaxed atmosphere and it is pretty large. The salon is very clean, well lit,  has a great appearance, and all of their equipment is well sanitized, cleaned and taken care of. The price is a little high (but not too high), but I don't mind paying for quality. I've gotten gel polish done here several times as (well as a pedi) and their polish selection is large and primarily OPI as well as other good brands. Definitely a place that I recommend to those in the Tempe area.

Always hot and delicious. I get takeout from 5 RCha far more than I should. They're always willing to work with my requests, and they're always wonderful all of the time. Thanks for continuing to be my go to Thai place for over two years!

This place is great! I went here for lunch and the food was delicious. It was kind of empty though, which was a shame. It should be more popular! But I enjoyed the quiet. I've also gotten food from 5 R Cha Thai Go and it's great. I'm only giving this location four stars because I have only gone one and would like to try it again.

I really wanted some pho the other night and decided to check this place out. I had seen it from the road a million times and thought I'd give it a try. I have to say, it wasn't really what I had expected. It wasn't terrible, but it was very far from good. The pho was okay, I got  the chicken. But I feel like they didn't give very much basil, lime, and jalapeño on the side. Portions were large which was good. My major issue with this place was the smell. OH THE SMELL. That smell was not a smell that belonged in a restaurant. There was something funky happening in there, and it was not good. In fact, it was very strong. I couldn't tell if it was garbage, or their cleaning solution they used on the table, but I was very close to just leaving when I first got there. (The only reason I didn't leave was because I was already there and starving.) It felt dirty too, but it was really dark in there so it was a little hard to tell. Could have been the smell that made me feel that way though. The music was really really loud too, I may just be being picky, but it could have been taken down a notch (or several). The service left a quite a bit to be desired, but wasn't the worst. I'm just very "ehh" about this place. If people were going and invited me, I'd go and probably wouldn't complain. If I were seeking out pho on my own, I think that I would definitely try somewhere else.   Now after reading the other reviews, I won't ever touch this place. I feel like I got lucky.

Just bought a mattress, box spring, and frame from AZ Mattress Outlet. I seriously could not be happier! Brendan was extremely helpful and friendly. I walked in and felt comfortable and not overwhelmed, and was greeted immediately. He was very helpful in helping me find the right mattress, in the right size, feel, and price. The prices were low, and I got a high quality mattress. I bought my bed and it was delivered to my house within an hour! I highly recommend  this business to anyone who is in the market for a new mattress. Thank you so much!

Thanks so much! My spare died on my way to their shop and they came out and switched the tire for me right away, and gave me a ride back to their shop. I was in and out quickly and they did a great job with a great price! Super friendly and amazing customer service. Wayne has a great shop here, highly recommended!!!

Just got the best pedicure of my life here, and it was the cheap one! I can't wait to get the delux! I randomly came in here because my regular places was booked and Pearl popped up on google maps. This salon is brand new, super clean, and absolutely beautiful. My basic pedicure included a very thorough cuticle trimming (the most detail oriented one I have ever seen, seriously it was amazing!), long foot and leg rubs, and he cracked my toes too! I'm so glad I came here by chance, I will be a long time customer from now on. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Andy is amazing!
