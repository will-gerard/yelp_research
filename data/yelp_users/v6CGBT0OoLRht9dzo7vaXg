Okay, totally ecstatic about the Big Red! And the pulled pork, was juicy, tender and just down right good.The mac and cheese wasn't too cheesy but it had a nice pepper season to it... it was delicious. Because we got our order to go they put the sauce on the side so we can pour it on to our liking. I use the whole of sauce. It's sweet but with a spicy lil kick/aftertaste. I know of very few BBQ spots that have left a positive taste in my mouth and this is one for future reference to hit up if I'm looking for a good hole in the wall BBQ spot.

This truly is my fave deli in Phx. My friend Adan treated me to this lil secret spot and I decided to follow him on his food suggestion to get, THE D.A.M. SANDWICH. Pork roast rubbed with southwestern spices, pulled and marinated in a jalapeño and onion barbeque sauce. Topped with the Duck's famous coleslaw. Served on onion roll. Is your mouth watering yet?  There's a lil something for everyone on this menu; from your true carnivores to your dedicated vegetarians.   Aside from the amazing food the ambiance is just awesome. You can either take a seat out on the patio (which you pass by on your way in) or you can sit anywhere theres a table and chair inside. My fave spot, is back by the wine cellar and beers. Yes! that's right if you'd like you can purchase a bottle of your liking to go or have the bartender there open it for you to enjoy with your lunch.   They also have a great lil store area to pick from herbal teas, to handmade cards and organic rices. Great place overall and I just can't wait to introduce someone to it so they can enjoy it as much as I have.

This place is unlike any place I've been to overall in Arizona. This lounge has such a dark and sultry feel to it. Barely lit, with velvet couches, leather chairs and barely lit lantern lights and a beautiful oversized mirror on the wall.    When my date and I had a seat and I was able to take in the ambiance, I couldn't help but notice the clientale. Very well dressed, upscale, sexy and almost secretive. The setup of the seating, seems to bring you in closer to whom you are with, which just looks shady or sexy, depending on the voyeur. The music was nice for the setting and the cocktail waitress was a sweetheart.   We ordered the Dirty Martini's w/ bleu cheesed stuffed olives (my fave) and the bartender nailed it and even gave us a tastey orange drink to sip on. Tasted almost like a rich orange julius.  Anywho, if money isn't a problem and you are looking for a very relaxed, sexy environment to take a date or enjoy with some friends, I highly suggest you take a moment to check out this spot.

If you're into dive bars, live rock music,  and cheap drinks this is definitely your place. The crowd may seem a lil rough around the edges, with your rockabilly & psychobilly people, mixed with some bikers but don't let it scare you away. The bartenders are awesome and know how to pour a stiff drink, and the patrons are pretty much friendly regulars. And for the kid at heart who likes games, they have pool tables and darts. Cheers!

Had the most positive experience in a government building when I visited to get my social security card. I literally walked in, checked in with the security guard, she gave me my ticket, checked my bag for weapons, and I sat down for literally 4minutes and was called up to a window.   It was about noon when I visited on a Friday to get my Social Security Card, and the representative was super pleasant and helpful. I strongly suggest if you don't want to deal with parking issues with the downtown location, come here!

I remember I was introduced to Cheba Hut for the first time about 6-7 yrs ago when I got my first job working at the mall and quite thankful for being introduced to a toasted sandwich. The La Canna is my fave! It's Prosciutto ham, genoa salami, smoked ham, black olives & provolone cheese. Basically their version of an italian but soo damn good! Be sure to leave room for their hemp brownies or Rice Krispy Bar, which both are amazing. The crew that works at this locale, is very 'lax and you can tell they have kept a constant run of their regulars there. Hell I've been going there 6yrs now!

Love! The Teriyaki beef and the Kalua Pork  with the mac salad and and rice. For dessert I had the Grandmas Caramel Chocolate Cake. Now let me tell you about this cake...heavenly! It's Chocolate cake with caramel and topped with macadamia nuts, whipped cream, toffee and a side of coconut ice cream. If you're trying to watch the calories, this spot is not for you. But know you won't be disappointed with the food they have to offer.   Also there are a few items I would consider 'secret menu' items. I'm from Hawaii and it had been awhile since I had manapua and when I mentioned it the lady who was helping me was totally cool and told me they could make it for me even though it wasn't on the menu! Score! Yea, I'm a happy camper (Polynesian) :)

Never once have I ever been disappointed. I'm going to have to say this place is 1st ranked for me when it comes to authentic Hawaiian food in AZ. Their mac is delicious, the meat is never dry and always full of flavor.   My two personal favorites are the teriyaki chicken or beef and the bulkogi! Bulkogi means "fire meat" in Korean. It's grilled and marinated is yummy sauces. Definitely give it a try if you're in the Mesa area- you will not be disappointed!

I'm a huge fan of diners, but gotta be honest I wasn't too crazy about this one. Our server was awesome, super friendly and helpful in answering questions, but the food I ordered wasn't too great.  I ordered biscuits and gravy (the full order, which I have to add is ALOT and barely ate half of it) and some country potatoes on the side.  I felt like there was just a lot of flour going on in my food- kinda bland no flavor. The country potatoes were the best part and my pepsi.  The overall consensus at the table was it was decent not bad, just wouldn't go out of my way to grab a bite there in the future.  Maybe I should have went with chorizo?

Be sure to stop by this location and sit at the sushi bar and ask for Travis. He's seriously the best sushi chef. Best personality and outgoing chef and if you're super awesome, he just may sing to you :) Sundays, are the best as Kona offers happy hour all day. That means tasty and cheap sushi and saki bombs at a great price.

I can appreciate a good dive, and I think I found a local Scottsdale fave.  Ended up meeting a couple girl friends up there for a few drinks. To put it simply, the bar is a fun environment. Quite the mix of people that night we were there, which made it all the more fun.  Heads up though, the parking is limited in the front, so you may have to go around the back- don't be discouraged, there's plenty of room. Also, I didn't have the opportunity to order any food but the bartender could pour a stiff drink. Cheers!

Decided to try something, 'new', to me at least. I've passed by this spot on multiple occassions and it seems to have a steady flow of foot traffic, so I took the commitment of actually walking in and checking out their menu selection.   The pricing is a bit odd, for the most part all their sandwiches are priced the same, but they had about 20+ sandwiches listed with 2 prices- based on size. I decided to keep it simple and got the pastrami with mustard and pickles. All their deli meats are Boars Head, which Is a pretty good brand overall. The sandwich was good but I was a lil disappointed that it wasn't hot, more less warm. They give you a small bag of Wise chips with the sandwich which are alright but not the greatest. After spending $9 on the sandwich and a drink I felt a lil cheated, don't think I got my moneys worth but it wasn't a bad sandwich.

I pass this spot daily and finally had the opt to stop in and grab myself an iced coffee.   There is a sign on the front of the cash register with a woman talking on her cellphone and says "We WILL NOT serve you while you are on your phone." Can we say awesome! Totally drives me nuts when I see ppl in line/at the register on the phone.   Aside from their clever signage I noticed they have an extensive menu in which I will definitely have to try their food one day. My appetitie wasn't too big when I stopped in and was only trying to fill the caffeine void. The young lady whom was helping me out, suggest the Mexican Chocolate iced coffee which had about 4 shots of espresso.  Guaranteed that's what kicked my butt in gear that morning.Great suggestion! The ambiance of the spot is really cozy. I'm looking forward to stopping in again and trying a pastry or possible lunch bite soon!

I've really liked living in my community for the last year and half. I debated on renewing my lease in September, due to a rental increase; you'd think with the economy the way it is, they would have kept it the same or lowered it with me renewing but that wasn't so much the case.  To alleviate the mess and hassle of moving, I went ahead and renewed. The maintence guy, whom I feel awful for not remembering his name right now has ALWAYS been prompt to fix anything or service any issues that may have came up (which are few and far between), just an occasional filter change, lights swapped out that I couldn't reach, etc.  My place was newly upgraded on my move in, so I have stainless steel fridge, flat top stove, cherry cabinets and wood floors in both my bathroom and kitchen. I also have a nice fireplace, a roman sized tub as well as a walk in closet that is amazing for all my clothes. I really do love the community as it's super quiet, fairly young overall,clean and the management has always been very nice and helpful. Just hope they don't decide to raise the rent again, as it may push  me to actually move the 3rd time around.

Every time I come here, the GM is super awesome. He introduced himself awhile back, and now we're on a first name basis. Not sure if that's a sign that I go too often or great customer service (maybe a little of both).  As for the food itself, It's definitely not, 'Authentic' Mexican food, but for Mexican Fast food fix, this sure does beat Taco Bell. It's always fresh, and I'm a huge fan of the HOT sauce and lime salt chips they have there. I'm literally in between two locations, one off of Shea and another off Frank Lloyd Wright and whenever I'm looking to feed my Chipotle fix, I make sure to migrate to this one.

The visit to this North Scottsdale locale was long overdo. The food was absolutely delicious. I've only visited the locale in Tempe and enjoyed their beer and pretzels but this time around, a date and I decided to make a stop in and try the 'food food'.   The place was pretty busy, due to a Suns vs Lakers game on- but it didn't discount the service what-so-ever. The hostess were very kind, and prompt in finding us a great spot to sit. Our server was also a pleasure and very helpful when it came to some of the menu knowledge.   We warmed up with an appetizer of pretzels to share (FYI:2 come in 1 order) and enjoyed a Hefeweizen garnished with an orange slice. My date got the Arizona Peach ale, which was tasty but sweet, so heads up- you may be disappointed if you order a pitcher.  For the meal, I tried the 'Popper' Burger, medium, which included a heap of fried onion strings, atop of a juicy burger with sliced grilled jalapenos and cream cheese. Seriously soo good- I'm actually getting hungry thinking about it again lol.  There was absolutely no room for dessert but the meal, the bar setting and the service was great. I will definitely be back soon! Can't believe I've lived on this side of town about 3 yrs and it took me this long to stop in.

I can't stress how disappointed I was with this location.  I ordered the Mexican Chipotle Guac burger with water and my boyfriend orders a Patty Melt with an ice tea. The waitress brings our drinks out and first thing I see is a fly floating in my water. I'm sorry but it was a large fly, you could have avoided that situation promptly but sat down the drinks walked away. We sent both of our drinks backs, just because I don't know if that came from the fact that you left your ice area completely exposed and open allowing flys to get in there but we gave up on the drinks and tried to wing the food.  Next comes the food. My 'Mexican Chipotle Guac Burger' was pretty much a guac burger. I had a spot of chipotle sauce on the bun that I couldn't even taste and the burger was dry and overcooked. My boyfriends patty melt had burnt onions and his burger was also dry and overcooked. At this point, I'm irritated and upset. I asked the waitress to take the food back and I'll pay for the fries we ate. While I offered to pay for my fries, you would have thought she would have said don't worry about it and let us go on our way. False. She charged us for the fries and didn't come back to our table but sent over what I assume was her manager.   The whole experience was really a let down as I remember the first time going to a Johnny Rockets some 20 years ago and never having a negative experience since. This most definitely left a for lack of better words "bad taste" in my mouth and I will not be going back.

Looking for a dive bar, you got it! Been a long time favorite of mine and not sure why it took me soo long to write a review. I had some friends come for a visit from Tucson and they really just wanted a bar that they didn't have to worry bout dress code and obnoxious college students- Palo Verde it is! The bartenders they always have there are super nice- the crowd is very friendly and 'lax. The drinks are cheap that's for sure and if you wanna play a game of pool and dig some good 'ol rock & punk music blaring from the blown out speakers, this is your new spot. Definitely gotta keep a close eye out tho for it's location. You can easily pass it up if you're not looking. A Diamond in the ruff if you will :)

Looking for a spot with wi-fi and friendly staff, this location is awesome. They recently did a redesign inside with more efficient seating and layout. There's plenty of spots with plug outlets to hook up the laptop and plenty of window spots with a view.  Location faces Alma School road, in the Alma Elliot Square center.

Definitely one of my all time fave mexi spots in AZ. Located directly across from Chandler High School, and somewhat of a small spot so if you aren't paying attention you can pass it right on up.   I've never had any complaints on their food as it's always been fresh and tasty to the very last bite. I miss not living on that side of town in regards to missing out on good lil spots like this. North Scottsdale doesn't really have any good hole in the wall spots for mexi food, so it's a treat when I can make a stop by here

I will vouch that this truly is one of the "worlds greatest collector car auctions." The variety of vehicles that this auction carries is just mind blowing. I had the opportunity to attend the Opening Night Gala, that provides hosted cocktails and culinary treats from an array of restaurants.  I can't really describe the vehicles other than they were absolutely gorgeous. If you have the opportunity to attend the Gala (which is invitation only) you will be able to view all the vehicles before they go to auction.    Aside from all the entertainment, drinks, treats and amazing cars...I'll say  my one complaint would be the parking for the event this year, which was a tad inconvenient. They drastically separated the Valet lot from the public lot, which in turned made for a LONG walk from the public lot in heels, when there was plenty of open area they could have had for public near the valet. Especially with the weather being drizzly/sprinkling- it just made for a non pleasant hike to the "Garage" for the event.

If you like Chicken and you LOVE cheese, and aren't counting the calories, you must get the Pollo Magnifico. It's a deep fried burro filled with chicken and topped with jalapeno cream cheese, cheddar cheese and served with rice and beans. So delicioso. Yea that was the lil bit of hispanic girl coming out, don't laugh. lol  The service is A-Ok but the Food I'm definitely a fan of!

YUMMY! Pretty sweet and simple. I haven't had the opportunity to dine in, but I hear the ambiance is great. We generally do take out when we work late nights, and the food hasn't disappointed me yet.   The Nachos del Sol is great.. Tortilla chips topped with chorizo, pepperjack cheese, pico de gallo, guacamole,chipotle sour cream & jalapeno peppers with house salsa. (not appropriate for those sensitive to heartburn)   A healthier approach would be  the Tequila lime salad with grilled chicken. The dressing is a great touch and the flavors just mix well w/ the chicken and greens.  Last but not least- you must try the Chicken Tortilla soup. Thick, and sooo good with the touch of avocado and sour cream.   So next time you're looking for a different touch for take out- you should try Old Town Tortilla Factory

Totally disappointed.   Unless you're making a visit at the weeee hours of the morning after a late night at the bar, and you're taste buds are non existent and you're a.d.d. and don't mind waiting forever for food - this place was just horrible from taste to service.   FYI if you ever order a grilled cheese keep in mind they slap a tomato on it. UGH! I was disgusted. First of all I gag at the sight of tomatoes let alone the taste.Grilled cheese is not on the menu, but I figured when I asked for a grilled cheese it was just that. Bread with grilled cheese. Sorry I to vent but i was livid. I waited 45min for that and had to send it back.   two thumbs down

Anyone who is familiar with the night scene in Scottsdale, has stumbled their way to this pizza joint at some place or another after the bars have let out. The pizza is greasy and tasty but definitely the cure to sober up and line the stomach with something solid after a 'rough' night.   The lady whom works there is a doll, very sweet and always in a great mood, despite having to deal with all the ridiculously sloppy drunk individuals there at the late hours.

I was introduced to Thai food today- and have to say that this place was great and informative on the menu selections. I'm really picky when it comes to food in general but was pleased with how awesome my waitress was in explaining everything to me.  I ended up ordering the Yoke (pronounced Joke) soup and the Thai Basil Pasta with minced chicken and no tomatoes with the spicy factor one notch down from the spiciest and it was DELISH!   I have no competing Thai locales to compare it to, because once again this was my first experience but first impressions last forever and I know I'll be back for more to feed my spicy food palate cravings!

Soo Short and sweet. The staff is extremely friendly but not a huge fan of the food. I ordered the 'Island' Burger (emphasis on the Island for Thousand Island but there was literally just a quarter size portion on the burger. Granted I asked for a side of it later so I could 'fix' my burger but just irritated me that it didn't live up to its name. It's pretty much a bar food type place, stuff you could make on your own with ease- just saying.

You really can't top their beer selection, well over a 100+ bottled beer selections and a good amount on tap. Also- for bar, they have some great food. I had the Beer-B Que Chicken personal pizza with red onions which was soo tastey and went nicely with my dirty pear beer.  The only disappointing thing, was I asked the bartender for a dirty pear pint and he came back with just the pear cider, So I had to school him on how to make a dirty pear beer.  Other than that- no complaints!

A lil disappointed with the place. Love the decor but the place was dead, faint music and everyone just seemed out of it and zoned out, some zombie type movie, ya know?  The beer was definitely overpriced, as was their shots. Kinda wish I would have stuck around at Papago Brewery, and not migrated over to this spot.   The staff of girls working were really cool and pretty upbeat but it could have been my $60 bill i racked up in a matter of an hour/hour and a half tops.   Again nice staff but poor prices- not sure I'll be back, at least not for the drinks- I still wanna try their food tho.

Probably one of my fave 'hole in the wall' mexican food places around. There's not too many of these types of places in North Scottsdale, so it's a nice place to stop for lunch when I'm working in Old Town; convenient location.  They have the best adobada burritos around and their tacquitos are always fresh (as is all their food). I really can't begin to name off my faves because everything I've had there is great. Seating is limited, but don't let that deter you, they do have a drive thru and all their ingredients are fresh and doesn't take long to get your order.

Love love love it! I had the half combo, which is a sandwich on sourdough w/Salami, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Provolone and I asked them to hold the ham- comes with their house italian, lettuce, mayo and mustard. Absolutely delicious! After I finished the 1/2 sandwich I decided to be daring and grab a piece of the cheesecake, which was to die for. I haven't had a slice of homemade cheesecake in a long time.   The staff was so nice and friendly and the locale was very clean and tidy. I think I found a new fave spot.

I FINALLY made it into this place and totally stoked! I gave up drinking soda a long time ago, and will have one every once in a great while but after walking through the POP doors, I'm in trouble. They seriously have everything in this place, my personal fave being the Boyland Vintage Soda Pop Creme Soda! I seriously turned into a giddy kid when I got in there. I stopped in with a couple girlfriends during a lunch break, and will have to definitely go back and grab some more Soda Pop. They have really great novelty bottles too that make for creative gifts, as I purchased one today for a buddy of mine.  Last but not least they have a good lil selection of novelty candy. Wax Stache's, wax lips, pop rocks along side with a handful more of those vintage candy memories. Make the effort to stop by and check it out.  Worth the file and the price, (which I have to add is cheap), for good cane sugar soda, not that crappy fructose schtuff. They do have diet alternatives for you health conscious individuals as well :)

By far one of my fave brewery's/bars in the valley. I look forward to the fall season bc that's when I know they will have their seasonal beer, Pumpkin Porter on tap soon. Absolutely amazing and one beer I actually  grew a craving for. My typical beer other wise is their house Hefeweizen with their order of salted pretzels with spicy mustard, which is FANTASTIC..If you're looking for a sweet but dry dark beer try the Oatmeal Stout, it's amazing as well. Alright I'm drooling thinking about this place, and no I'm no alcoholic just a beer connoisseur.

I've never really been disappointed with Mill Cue Club. You get exactly what you see.  A college area pool hall, loud but fun environment. Lively bar with pool table entertainment in the back and awesome drink specials and happy hour!   $2.75 for drafts $2.50 for pints of Kiltlifter and Dos Equis  and my fave $3 tall Long Island drinks during happy hour... Seriously.. for $20 you can get pretty tipsy and take care of your bartender and everyone has a smile.

This is probably one of my fave lil local dives. Great place to grab a stiff drink (at a reasonable price) and check out music, of all types really. Depending on the night, you can hear anything from hard rock/metal, club/Top 40 to even some hip hop music.   The owner and staff are always friendly and look forward to checkin in and seeing them when I'm able to make a stop by the place.   For those whom are a bit A.D.D. and can't take the constraints of the bar stool or booth, they've got a few pool tables, Buckshot and a dart board to keep your attention as well. And for those smokers they have a 'pit room' I'd like to call it. Basically another room with ventilation for those of you who would like to smoke.   FYI: Tuesday's they have a $5 cover for unlimited well drinks and domestic beers, between the hours of 830pm-930pm.  Cheers!

A few years ago I would have said eh decent place but now- I don't care for this place. I think this is the one bar that attracts most of the obnoxious  college crowd and 'kids' for that matter out of all the Mill Ave bars.   I have no problem with college bars but this one in particular just isn't for me- hell if you're fresh to the bar scene and just turned 21 cheers to you- this may be your intro to the bar scene, if that's your sort of thing

Generally when I'm craving BBQ I think of Toms right away- always been a fave of mine. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which comes topped with a bit of their house coleslaw; I'm not a fan of coleslaw whatsoever but makes a good touch to the sandwich.   Like Amy said below they have big bottles of their sauce (mild and hot), at the table and tend to get a lil happy with the hot bbq sauce, I have problem lol. Also keep in mind the curly fries are meant to be shared they are a HUGE order but sooo good.

It's not bad but definitely not my fave by all means and I feel when the option to eat here comes up, I double think that as an option and think of what else there is around. I'm not too impressed with the menu and it's definitely food you don't wanna order to go- just doesn't preserve itself well for a ride home (short one at that). If I do eat there, I will give them that they have an awesome grilled cheese. Multiple types of cheeses served with fries. I ordered an arnold palmer but I guess the girl wasn't too familiar that pink lemonade just isn't the same.  Aside from having a meal there,the bartenders there are pretty nice. the one overheard me, comment on horrible the Peach Bellini they had there was (note do not order Peach Bellini- you'll thank me) and offered to make something I did enjoy. A lot of places in the area wouldn't have made the effort unless you know the bartender personally. So yea- not my fave and not my first choice but not bad.

If I'm looking to step it up from your drive thru burger joint, Delux is definitely the place that hits the spot. The signature Delux Burger with sweet potato fries are absolutely mouth watering. The little added novelty of the sweet potato's coming in a mini grocery cart was also a nice touch accompanied by a nice aioli sauce to dip in. Now I'm not a fan of onions, let alone grilled onions by all means, but the waiter talked me into them and I'm glad he did. The carmelized onions were a nice texture touch to the burger and infused the burger with more flavor.   After what I felt like, was inhaling my delicious burger, we had a apple cinnamon cookie with a glass of milk. Such a great finish to a great burger. A nice 'fancy' touch to comfort food indeed.

By far THE BEST crepé's I have ever had. I remember, before leaving Las Vegas, a girlfriend of mine insisted we make a stop over at the Paris for brunch and I'm forever grateful for her introducing La Creperié to me.  I had the D'Anjou - a pear,  with caramel, almond paste, whipped cream and walnus. Pretty much a heaven treat in your mouth, chased by some refreshing, Organina.   They have plethora of choices to choose from though to lure anyones taste buds in. Shrimp and hollandaise sauce, Nutella and almonds, etc. You won't be disappointed.

I had a wonderful time at Cafe Zulu, which is located within the Hotel Valley Ho. I think the 'Cafe' part throws me off tho, because I feel it's more of a lounge/bar with very mod-esque decor; something that reminds you of a scene out of The Jetsons.  They have a great happy hour menu that lists a range of appetizers from Bruschetta, Prime rib dip w/au jus, to a handful of signature drinks and domestic beers for only $3 a piece. It's a great deal!  The Chef who works for the Valley Ho and who happened to be creating these tasty appetizers, came out and introduce himself asked if everything tasted good and if he could do anything for us, while our waitress was very cool and insightful on the drinks and appetizers as well. Now that's what I call great service. You can't beat a $3 happy hour menu

If you're looking for some great authentic Greek food, this is not the place. If you're looking for your fast food version of Greek food- this would be an accurate comparison. I was disappointed in the Greek salad, the rice not bad but not great either and the pita not too shabby as well. The meat was probably the best part of the dish but not my fave.   Again if you're in the promenade and looking for a quick bite not a bad spot to stop just don't expect anything authentic.

I love this location! I really think all the employees there know me by name and by my card (as it's a Hello Kitty Visa), hey don't judge! Anywho, the manager/owner is always working and he isn't always behind the register, he's actually picking up and greeting everyone in the establishment, I love that! Crazy concept but interacting with your customers, brings them back. Aside from the service, their food is literally always fresh and to order. I've never had any overcooked food, or old/stale vegies. It's in a great location and just very convenient.  Personally I always go for the burrito bowl, but they have lots of alternaties and especially for the vegietarians/vegans.

Delish! I didn't have the opportunity to dine in, as we were picking up food for our company party, but I have to say the take out area was convenient and the girls were very friendly and organized. It helped that the Take out was seperate from the main enterance and that they had curb side pull up (Take note: lunch hour is VERY busy).  I had the pleasure of having a lil bit of everything we ordered, being that this was my first 'expereince with Maggiano's I wanted to ensure of course that I gave it a fair shot on my review ha. Who are we kidding, the food was amazing. The lasagna with meat sauce, Chicken Parm, Chopped salad and Caesar salad all delicious.   We got the 1/2 orders of the catered dishes, which for all of the above (which came with rolls) was enough for an office of 16. The food portions were perfect with leftovers to spare.  Looking forward to experiencing the dining in abiance, in the near future!

Looking for your not so typical bar- Big Bang is definitely a good option. Let me forewarn you tho, if you don't do well in crowded places, this is not for you. Friday & Saturday nights especially make for an overcrowded venue and wait in line. There's a good amount of audience participation with all the songs and it's just an all around upbeat, fun environment that's a lil different than anything else Mill Ave has to offer.

It's been a lil bit since I've made a stop into Sauce- but had to write up a review bc I've never been disappointed with their service or their food- I'm a fan of the Fox restaurant's and this on in particular is a fave. My fave pizza is the Rosemary Potato (spinach, feta and Olive tapenade) as for the salad the Chicken, pine nuts & gorgonzola is a winner.. seriously very tasty. They really have a lil bit of everything when it comes to pasta dishes as well and the location is convenient if you're walking around waterfront.

Go big or go home right!? I haven't had too much BBQ in Arizona but what I've had I haven't been too impressed. I will however say that JOE'S REAL BBQ was really good. I'm a fan of supporting local business, and there's a nice 'comfy/family' feel to the place. Now, I come from a big bbq'ing Texas family, and though I have to express this isn't no comparison it's pretty damn good Arizona BBQ. I had to try a little of everything so I got the BBQ Sampler plate   Over 3/4 lb. of ribs, chicken, pork and beef, bread.  Includes homemade side dish. Add a 2nd side for just $1.00 [with a side of Mac N Cheese and Beans.] Yea I couldn't finish it all, especially with having a taste of my boyfriend corn bread and my friends rootbeer cake.. Can we say HEAVEN.   For lack of better words I was in a food coma, but walked away happy and full.

Gorgeous property and such friendly staff, from the bell hop to the front desk and housekeeping, I enjoyed my stay to the fullest.  I was attending a Halloween event this past weekend and booked a room to alleviate any hassle of getting home.  The decor of the rooms were beautiful, modern and classy. The novelty of having a phone in the the bathroom was just comical to me, but nice touch. And the view I woke up to was amazing. Overlooking the pool, and palm trees and in the distance were the mountains.   I wish I would have had the opportunity to experience more of the amenities the property had to offer but can definitely say, though I literally live right down the street, I will be back.

Probably one of my new fave pubs in North Scottsdale. Fibber McGee's was one of my faves in Chandler, and I just recently found out that Skeptical Chymist is the, 'sister locale'.   I went on a Thursday night with my buddy, and the bartenders were really cool and easy going and they had a guy singing acoustic on a stage- whom I might add was very good and very good looking haha. But that is besides the point. The decor in the place was great, the bathrooms were clean and the the bar itself was awesome.  I didn't get to eat there but the bartender made my drink, Black Velvet aka 'Dirty Pear' perfectly! (pear cider topped with Guinness) * I highly suggest you try it!!  Definitely going back soon-

I'm a fan- It's a nice get away from the Scottsdale bars I'm surrounded by and seems every time I go in there I happen to run into someone I know. Kinda like my own, "Cheers" type bar. After a few visit to start to figure out there are quite a few regulars.   The girlys that work there rock and the bartenders are pretty friendly and pour a stiff drink for sure. The food is not too shabby, and the overall crowd is pretty cool. You really get a variety of all types of people there, so you will definitely fit in.  Last but not least they have a good selection of micro brews to choose from as well, just have to check out their specials.  Cheers!

Absolutely love the guys and the station. Everyone from the 'corporate' to the promotions team, are awesome and make every event an adventure.   As for the location, it's a lil nestled away in the Guadalupe area. So the building may throw you off. Everyone here is a a lot of fun and sincerely some of the nicest people you will meet!

I think I have probably tried every diet available. I was skeptical about scheduling with Dr Knighton, but figured I'd give it a shot. The staff was very friendly and other clients whom were in the waiting room gave me their opinion and their success stories, which made me feel better about going through with the process. Dr Knighton was genuine and encouraging and I hope to have an update to say the process has worked and pushed me more to my goal. So far I'm 4 days in and I've lost 5lbs!

Plain & Simple their happy hour rocks and their nightly specials are the best. $5 dozen wings, and FYI the HOT is like,  "hello I'm going to scorch your mouth and you're going to need 4 of their $3 32oz beers lined up to chased the burn" but it's SOOO damn good. Their Zipparittas are also awesome and the wait staff are all super awesome friendly at this locale.

Since going Organic and Gluten-Free, I'd say Trader Joe's has absolutely made shopping soo much easier and not a chore. With a variety of options and everything clearly labeled and categorized, I couldn't be happier with my shopping ventures.   The staff and management have been absolutely friendly and helpful, anytime I've had questions or needed assistance in finding something.  You can say I'm pretty much a neighborhood regular now!

Such a great place-  Great ambiance & atmosphere and the food is incredible.  Strongly suggest to any newbies to try the Pollo Colonial w/ sweet and spicy glaze and the patatas Bravas: [spicy potatoes] the portions are enough for 2 (in some cases). Chase that meal with some of their House Sangria and you are set.   The staff was very friendly and courteous. If you're looking to take your significant other out or possibly going out for a first date, this is a great place.

Between the hours of 7-8am, like any Starbucks location the drive through is FULL. You're best bet is to park it and walk in, it's much quicker to get your order and get out.   All the gals at this locale are super sweet and bubbly, and they get credit for the hours that their up serving all of us in need of our caffiene fixes lol.  I will say, that if you are a fan of hot breakfast food, I would get it here. Their oatmeal is good but their sandwhiches, not so much. They nuke them in a microwave and tho they feel warm/hot on the outside in their lil sacks, the last two times I bit into them the egg was cold. Eww!  Opt for a danish or something, or maybe go next door and get a fresh bagel or donut from Dunkin.   Jus sayin :)

By far THE BEST wing spot around! Don't let the building sway you from the great food inside. It's definitely one of those 'dive bar' sorta places, but the price is great for what you get.  They have a 2 dozen wings + basket of fries for $15 and $1.50 draft pints. C'mon on now- that's a friggin deal.  The wings are pretty big and the sauces are amazing. Now I love hot, and I'll tell you the 'HOT' tingled my lips and burned my mouth but I couldn't stop lol. The Medium is a bit spicy but really good and their house bbq wings are tasty as well. They have Medium and Mild for you wimps, haha jk. And Suicide and Atomic for you brave ones. There's actually a side note to the 'ATOMIC' wings; "must show proof of insurance before serving". Classic!  Nothing on the menu exceeds $6, ranging from Salads, mozzarella sticks to burgers and philly cheese steak sandwiches. The place is ran by a cute couple and their sons, nice family owned restaurant .   Now if any of you are brave to try the ATOMIC- I've gotta know !

Found my new obsession store. For those toys and novelties I fall in love with online, I have found a store that carries it locally. From everything ranging from TokiDoki, Dunny's, Johnny Cupcakes, etc- they have it!  I discovered this place when Johnny Cupcake's was actually in town do his Suitcase Tour promo from their locale. The staff is pretty nice, and tho the store is fairly small they have an array of items that will tickle just about anyones fancy and tastes.

Okay best marketing tactic ever! They twitter a word to 'whisper' and  the first of 50 people to whisper that word get their cupcake of the day. GENIUS! As tempting as it may be to go daily, but they have had some amazing concoctions to choose from. I generally have to share, bc I'm not a huge icing fan- but if you have the opportunity to have their 'Elvis' cupcake (banana cupcake w/peanut butter frosting), it's a must! The classic fave is their Red Velvet Cupcake though, can't go wrong.

I was actually really disappointed. I grew up going to D&B in Texas when I'd visit my family there and absolutely loved the place, but the locale at Tempe Marketplace would kind of a let down. I definitely wouldn't grade their food an A, it was decent but I mean it's 'playground' for kids and big kids alike I suppose, so you're not necessarily going for the food.  But the cleanliness was horrible. I walked into the womans bathroom and almost every stall was clogged/or cluttered as if it had been TP'd by a bunch of children.  Our waiter was a great help and super nice, but when I approached someone on the management staff in regards to the untidy bathroom the mans response was, "Don't worry about it we have someone on it" . I was seriously a bit taken back at his response and it rubbed me the wrong way. Don't think I'll be making another trip back, anytime soon.

I've been a long time fan. My first visit to this place was wayy back when, literally. I had my first Aunt Chilada's experience when I was 8 and my family and I have been visiting ever since then. Not sure why it took me so long to leave a review.  They have one of the biggest tequila selections in Arizona, by far! And if you're a Tequila connoisseur like myself you will appreciate it.  I'm a big fan of their Sunday brunch. They have a great selection at great prices and can really modify a the plates to your liking if you want. If it's a nice day out, I suggest sitting out on the patio. They have umbrellas to shade your area, but it's cute to see the ducks from the pond hanging out and walking around.

Alright- the first rating would have been an 'A-OK' but they got an extra star for the eye candy bartender(s). lol. The bartenders were quick and on their game and it was nice not having to wait forever and a day for a drink with a full bar. It was a nice added touch to have a mechanical bull in the house- nothing better than watching a bunch of drunk people trying to ride a bull and keep their composure and balance . Cheers!

One of my fave dives! Just keep in mind before you head in...CASH ONLY! The crowd is easy going and everyone who works there is super nice. On Friday nights, they have DJ's, which is always fun! A small dance area and light effects and CHEAP DRINKS! I mean really you can't go wrong. And this is one of 3 bars I know that actually carry my Whipped Cream Vodka! If dancing isn't really your thing they have another side you can go shoot a lil pool at as well.  Last but not least, if you're looking for a quick bite after the bar lets everyone out, they generally have chili dogs or tamales to purchase outside. So keep that in mind as well!

Very disappointed . A nice environment wasted and not represented well. Our 15min wait turned into 30 and that was just the beginning to a not so great experience.  I've had horrible service the last two visits I've made to this location. The service was extremely slow, and we were forgot about when sitting at the Sushi Bar. So my suggestion would be to sit at an actual table, so you're not disregarded.   The sushi was good but wouldn't say it was great for the money spent. A lil bland and the pieces were few. I've been to a good amount of sushi spots in the valley both 'commercial' and divey locations and this really missed the target all together on customer service and presentation.   I will not be going back.

Can't say I had the food but the bar on a Sunday is awesome! $1 Mimosa's and watching the game = priceless, plain and simple. They had a handful of other specials ranging from draft to saki. Definitely a worthwhile trip on a lazy Sunday to relax and watch the game.

Officially a fan. I wasn't able to review the place fully because I hadn't tried the food yet, but last night I made a delish mix at Genghis.  Marinated steak chased by a few seasonings, and that yummy teriyaki, dragon, and asian sauces with Udon noodles...I think I'm drooling writing about this right now. It was seriously soo good and fresh nothing frozen.   My buddy and I sat at the bar watched the game, enjoyed great food with good convo and sipped out countless mimosa's. Definitely a great way to spend a Sunday.

This was one of the many places we stopped at for our pub crawl and I'm definitely a fan. Where else can you go to snag $4 saki bombers!? Exactly! With 1/2 priced signature house drinks and 1/2 priced maki sushi menu and appetizers, you're sure to get your moneys worth.

Definitely one of my fave spots in North Scottsdale to grab great dessert and some of the best coffee around. Every visit I've had, has been great. The guys, whom I'm assuming are the owners are always very cordial and helpful in assisting with a new dessert to try out and ensuring my experience was a positive one. I haven't had the opportunity to get a full meal there yet, but the food smells delicious and looks soo appetizing each time I visit, so that's on the to do list for the next stop in.  I have to highly suggest the creme brulee- so far it's my favorite dessert item. The plating of everything makes all the dishes look like masterpieces!   Bon Appetite!  *check out the photo gallery on Cafepino- you maybe sold just looking at some of the pics I uploaded :)

La Bocca is definitely one of my favorite spots in Tempe.  They have a really 'lax area with couches and when there's a game on they will put it up on the wall and project it. The places and ambiance is very contemporary, yet casual and fun. They have an amazing Hummus appetizer and they have a great selection of pizza's. The truffled mushroom pizza is TO DIE for. It comes with sautéed mushrooms, roasted tomatoes(I personally hate tomatoes and go w/out these), goat cheese, fresh spinach lightly tossed in balsamic vinaigrette and a little white truffle oil for good measure. YUM! Oh and don't forget to have a glass of their House Sangria...SO GOOD!  Anyone and everyone I brought there or suggested they go there has loved it!

So I'm very dissappointed in the service and probably won't be back unfortunately. My mother and I decided to try this locale out, since I haven't since living on this side of town.   Well we waited a couple minutes before anyone approached us to seat us, and then waited an additional minutes before the guy came back to give us menus. I was trying to give the guy the benefit of the doubt considering they seemed to be a lil busy but this was just a series of issues to come.  I ordered the italian beef hero which was actually really good but they didn't provide enough au jus, so i seriously waited forever and a day till the guy decided to come check up on us and see how we were doing. Come to find out he was only waiting on my table and two others (that came in after us), and making coversartion in the back with the employees which was the reason why there was such delay to assist us. When he finally did make it around and I commented the need for more au jus he said he'd be back witha  refill for my mother and my au jus. Well he passed us literally 5X's before he goes, "OH! The Au Jus". I mean come on dude where the heck is your head at?! After we were done with our meals, we decided we may attempt to go for some dessert so instead of waiting for him to bring the menu we walked over to the podium and grabbed one our selves. He came by and asked if we'd found something else and I asked him for a refill while we decide.  He again went behind the bar and started convo with another employee and trying to somewhat multi task- and this is where he f'd up. He took my drink and walked over to this senior couples table and put my drink down and went back to converse with the employee AGAIN. I then had to call him out and told him to come over to our table. I told him he just took my drink over to the other table and that I now longer want a refill or dessert, just my bill.   I was really disappointed- I definitely won't be back. To be honest as soon as we sat down I looked up the locale on Yelp and started to see the negative comments and was like, eh I'll give it try, maybe they just happened to hit them on a bad day, but that wasn't the case the service is just bad.

Fried Plantains, Chicken  and red beans and rice dish = DELISH! I can't say I've had any other Carribbean food, but for my first experience this was absolutely delicious. Ah the thought of it is making my mouth water... need to make another trip back soon before I get back on my health kick.

If you're looking for a quality salad with great ingredients I definitely recommend this place. They have plenty of other choices to select from ranging from salads, sandwiches and pizzas; I'm just a bit partial to the salads. You can do a "create your own" and have some great pesto chicken mixed in as well. Pretty casual setting but great decor.

Long time fan and lover of Market Bistro. Everything is always soo fresh and flavorful, and the fact it's family owned I think adds a lil special something. I've had nothing but positive experiences, anytime I've visited this establishment, and definitely go out of my way (which isn't too far) to get a healthy alternative from this spot.   I recently tweeted about having a craving for one of their amazing salads, and was shortly informed via a tweet from them, that they had a special going; Check in via Facebook places and snag an opportunity to get a free entree or pizza! DING! That evening I went in to market and again was given the best service and dinner tasted even better, who knew!   Keep an eye out for their specials and deals. They even have a VIP email sign up on their site. They're pretty socially active as well ,  so If you're not already on the Twitter network, what are you waiting for?

Being a salad connoisseur, I think these guys nailed it. They have a plethora of different salad creations to choose from and also allow you to 'build your own' salad if you wish to do so .   For the individuals who aren't too keen on their salad/greens there's an alternative - They have these amazing 'fluffy' crepe wraps to choose from as well as sandwiches, melts and soups.  The only downfall about the whole experience I feel is the SMALL cups they provide you with. Their portions, wether it be the salad or crepes, are fairly large, but then the 'to-go" style plastic cup they give you doesn't seem to compliment the meal. So just expect to make a few trips up to refill.   My fave salad at Tossed would be The Southwest Blackened Chicken Salad: Crisp hearts of romaine, blackened chicken, chopped tomatoes, tortilla strips, black bean corn salsa, feta and avocado with citrus chipotle dressing  Enjoy!

So I pretty much live here. It's in a great location and it's convenient for those last minute, "OMG, I don't know what I'm gonna wear" moments. The employees are super friendly and helpful when it came to tracking down an outfit I was desperate to find last moment. The store was in tact and tidy and the visual merchandising sucks me in everytime. I'm a sucker for walking in for one to nothing and coming out with a bag and always a new pair of flip flops.

Seriously my new fave place ever! Such a great variety of fashionable, clever, and witty clothes for youths but a plethora of items that bring me back to what I grew up with (novelty toys and items) as well as new mod things that aren't necessarily, "Necessary", but MUST HAVE/WANT items  to put on this years wish list.  They truly have everything from baby to adult items. I could literally spend a few hours and a bundle of cash if need be. Payday is coming up... I'll be seeing them very soon!

I can't say enough great things about this place.   First of all they had me at FRIED PICKLES! I mean c'mon, they nailed it! The burgers are made just the way YOU want it, with toppings, and sauces galore to choose from. Plain and simple, one of the best burger spots in Scottsdale, and I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about it.   A MUST TRY, if you're in the neighborhood!

I was disappointed with my visit this past Saturday. I'm generally a huge fan of Fox Restaurants, but this one fell short.   We made a reservation for about 13 people and ended up waiting almost 30-45min past our scheduled reservation time to be seated.   Once we were finally seated, then came the ordering. With me being on such a strict diet, I was a bit skeptical about finding anything on the menu. I ended up ordering the Blanco Chopped Salad. which on the menu is described as "Grilled Chicken, Seasonal Fruits, Pepitas (pumpkin seeds)" for $9. Sounds tastey right? Well before ordering it, I did ask the server if the 'salad' had lettuce in it, and he assured me it was lush mixed greens with mixed fruit, chicken, pepitas and a cilantro lime dressing. "Perfect!" Well that's not what I got.  Apparently mixed seasonal fruits meant just apples and there was tomatos chopped up in it. Now understand, tomatos are considered a fruit, but when you read seasonal fruits, a tomato is the last thing on my mind. They were totally reaching there. And when I read fruits, I'm assuming more than 2. FAIL.  Needless to say, I came in with no expecations and walked away completely disappointed.   I usually try and make one more attempt to go back to make a confirmed judgement, but this first visit literally left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't be going back.

Totally love this place! From walking through the front doors to a fresh smell of pine, down to the details; antler chandeliers, tree stump bar stools, fireplace and stuffed javelina along with other random animals.  I ordered the grilled cheese with sweet potato fries. YUM! I know what you're thinking, how do you mess up a grilled cheese, but believe me, it can happen. Theirs was pretty good, probably could have picked a different type of bread but overall good, and the sweet potato fries were taking over the plate but soo good!  I missed out on the Bar Olympics - which entails flip the cup, video games, quarters and a handful of other games, but definitely looking forward to getting back there for it soon.

Hands down the Oatmeal and the Pistachio are the best flavors. I've had my fair share of Fro-Yo places and this one is by far the cleanest, and tastiest of them all.  And the decor isn't too shabby either, I love it.  Yogurtology definitely has a plethora of toppings to choose from; Fruit, candy, syrups to even baklava!   They now offer a keychain card, so after I believe 8 purchases you get a $1.00 off your 9th purchase. Not bad. Definitely encourage you to try this place out... you probably won't sway to any other Fro-yo place after this :) Just saying.

pasty/past/ Noun: A folded pastry case filled with seasoned meat and vegetables aka AMAZINGNESS! Yes, amazingness is a word. A friend and I had decided to check this place out, and absolutely fell in love. I ordered the Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty: Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies and mexican stewed tomatoes, with a side of sour cream and salsa. If you want to add a lil more heat you can request some sriracha. They have a great selection of wine (I'm partial to their Malbec) and beers and their happy hour is killer.   The ambiance alone is pretty sweet as well. We sat at the bar, which is purely lit with candles. The tables are set with black church pews with candlight and dim lighting throughout. If it's a nice evening they have plenty of outdoor seating as well. Everyone that works there was soo chill and laid back. Made for a great evening !   Just hope next time I have enough room to try their dessert!

Hands down best Jalapeno hummus around; have them top it with their grilled seasoned chicken and some pita bread and a side salad you're set! They have an endless menu of amazing food, for every person.  'Nuff said.

DELISH! The bread was soo soft and fresh and they put just the right about of meat on their sandwiches and condiments as well. The establishment was clean and and the staff was super friendly from the greeting we got entering to our exit.   Kinda wish we had one up north by my place, but would definitely go out of my way for this over a subway any day.

I honestly wouldn't give this place any star's if that was possible. It's been awhile since I've had absolutely horrible service and tasteless food all in one visit. But this location seemed to hit both.  The service was HORRIBLE. My friend and I decided to sit at the bar, thinking that getting drinks would be easier but the girl was for lack of better words just out of it and not paying attention and we had to wave her down every time we wanted to get something to drink.  As for the food. THE WORST sushi I've ever had. The rolls were seriously overpriced, and disgusting.Aside from the fact she just completely forgot two of our rolls. Our meals came with soup that our waitress/bartender forgot about and she but after we reminded her she brought them out and it was basically just broth no tofu. Totally cheap'd out on the Miso Soup.   I left that place soo upset and just soo disappointed. I would STRONGLY suggest you not waste your time nor your money on making a visit here. I have plenty of positive sushi reviews and suggestions if you're looking for a great spot.

Really disappointed in 24 Hour Fitness. I've been a customer for 3-4 years and after a few experiences with some of the trainers and clientele, I've decided that leaving the club and going with another gym that is actually closer to work and home was a better option. I tried cancelling my membership on Friday at this location and was advised it would take a manager, between the hours of 8-5 to do so otherwise I could go online anytime to cancel.   This weekend, Sunday, I decided to go ahead and cancel my membership and when visiting the 'cancel membership' link on my login- it directed me to call an 866 number. 1) Don't direct me to a site when you know it's going to make me call a # 2) I called the number and sat on hold for 20+minutes with no response.  I hung up to call back my Dobson 24 Hour fitness location to talk to member services. I told the young lady the issues I had - my schedule doesn't permit me to come into the location between the hours, the site doesn't allow for cancellation and the number has had me on hold for 20+ minutes- Why couldn't I cancel my membership without a manager when I've clearly signed up for my membership without one, and have changed my billing multiple times without one. Her response, "You can ask corporate when you call and get through to them."   You could say I more than perturbed at this point with the customer service. I was a fan of the gym for awhile but the customer service as a whole is less than par and distills why I am taking my business else where.

So I'm going to pull the cheesy card and say " I Love this bar & grill" bc I do. It's a nice change of pace from the over saturated college bars in Tempe and burnt out Scottsdale bars. The novelty of getting my mixed drink or beer in a mason jar just rocks. There's a variety of people that go there, so get rid of your first instinct of this being your country hick bar, bc it isn't.

Cheap, quick, and freakin awesome! Oh did I add that they have free access to their vacuums. It's the worst when you pop your quarters in and you have just a lil more to go and bam- it shuts off. Definitely don't have to worry about that here. Also the cherry air freshner rocked my world and the lil wipey they give you to wipe your dash off was a lovely smell as well. I can't remember the last time i was eager about getting my car washed, but definitely running through there the next time I'm due for another car wash.

I love this location. I actually was regularly going to the locale on Scottsdale Rd but not only is this location 5 min from my house, but it's just overall cleaner, the staff is super nice and very helpful.   I work out at the crack of dawn and I've gotta give the a.m. staff credit they are perky just as much then as they are when I come back and work out in the afternoon.   The place is fairly clean at all times, and I've never really had to 'weight' on any machines. *See what I did there? lol Yea I'm a gym nerd. :)   I would say it would be nice to see some more classes offered here but other than that I really can't complain. They have some newer equipment here that I can't get from the larger location(s).   I'm moving in a week so I'm hoping my next 24 location is just as good if not better.

What's walking distance, tasty and cures my sweet tooth? Yogurtland! Yea I said it. They have a great choice of flavors and I love there topping choices as well- and well the price is perfect. You pretty much determine how much you want to spend bc you're charged on the weight of your selection. I had Raspberry tart topped with kiwis and blackberries - I think my mouth just watered explaining it again. YUM!

Absolutely LOVE this place. Today was my 2nd experience at Lolo's. Went to the one in Phoenix, about a few months ago. So I'm stoked they have a new location  conveniently down the street from work. The staff is soo friendly and helpful and the service in actually getting the food is extremely fast.  The food itself, amazing. Fried Chicken w/ Waffles (that I might add have an amazing flavor) doused in syrup and chased with some fruit punch kool-aid makes for a great lunch.   I think I may need a nap now.

Been with this complex for a lil over a year and a half and had a pretty positive experience. Anytime I placed a work order for something to be done or light bulbs to be changed out they were pretty quick and on the ball to get the job done.   My only complaint(s) are : the horrible response on calling back when I leave a voicemail. I've called multiple times where someone was out of the office and I had a question or needed to follow up and no one responded, which at that point I had to take the time to leave work early to get there before their offices closed to talk to someone.  My other complaint is that they treated my lease renewal somewhat of a 'wheel and deal' scenario, which I wasn't to happy about an which prompted me to look else where. I got a great deal at another location that I will soon be moving into but had they just given me the 'great' deal in the first place instead of playing this tug-o-war game, I would have never entertained the thought of moving out.

One word... Beautiful! The architecture is like no other typical hotel.  For a Best Western I was highly impressed.  The front desk was very friendly and helpful in the whole checking in process. Next was entering the room- 'ahhhh' lol yes the light was shining from above lol not really but that's the noise I made when my friend and I entered the room.   The property was designed for Downtown Scottsdale and the visitors of the area.. I love the layout with a spa available in the room. Classy and modern decor and a real value. Definitely one of Scottsdale's newest and most desirable lodging. Highly recommended.

The Cilantro Jalapeño hummus = heaven in my mouth. No seriously- the hummus and the grilled chicken on top is so tasty and surprisingly healthy. I was definitely a lil brought back that Pita Jungle came to the food court of the mall but I can say it hasn't lessened the taste or value of the food at all; just made it that more convenient to pick up some of their amazing food. Anything I've had off the menu, ranging from their salads (both leaf and fruit), the hummus and the pita plates, it's all great food.

Delish!!! Enough said. Marcella's has made me fall in love with Italian food all over again. Great prices and amazing food. We ordered 15 dishes for our office and I can't complain about one. From the Chicken Parmesean to the Layered Lasagna, down to the garlic cheese bread and apple salads, I was impressed with the flavor and presentation of it all.  The restaurant is great for small and large parties or even a pickup order. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and very knowledge in their menu.   For those who are watching the carbs and a lil bit of a health nut they do have alternatives (gluten free pasta, etc).   As for their happy hour its great! Half off their wine, sangria (red & white) and their house pizzas, which I might add are large and tasty.   Take boys, if you're looking for a great locale for a date this is the spot, the decor and ambiance is great!

I've been eyeing this place for awhile now, and decided to finally take the leap to try it out. My mom and I hadn't an clue what was on the menu but definitely up for trying something new Sunday afternoon.   Now I can't say I'm a fan of the winding line that lead to what reminded me of the Ikea cafeteria dishing area; I can say the food was absolutely delicious. My mother and I narrowed in on an original Pastrami w/ mustard sandwich with the shoestring fries and kosher pickle. They had to have piled on nearly half a pound of meat that was soo juicy, onto an Onion roll (which I requested, but you have a handful of bread choices to choose from). I have to add, that they have a house blueberry tea that was very refreshing and tasty as well.   I had a positive experience and plan on heading back soon to try out one of their many desserts that looks amazing, but I had no room for this visit.

I'm going to have to disagree with the perturbed review below. I on the other hand, had a pretty positive experience. Everyone was super friendly, from entering the establishment to departing the place.   I was approached by the owner, whom was very friendly and asked how our service was and also the entertainment manager who introduced himself and was a bit comical as well.   Being that I was recovering from the weekends festivities I decided to enjoy their house energy drink, Sucker Punch that I'm now addicted to and I also had a shirley temple, I mean c'mon- when you're in a diner you gotta have one or a malt shake. I wasn't hungry so I didn't get to try the food out, but definitely look forward to going back and trying it out.  To top off the whole night and really make me a happy camper would be, the acoustic performance by Aaron Lewis, singer of Staind. It was nice to enjoy the intimate performance.   This is Sucker Punch's soft opening, so I know they are currently only providing a limited menu at the moment but that should be changing soon in the coming weeks, so just keep that in mind- and check it out!

So there's been this craze and talk about a place called Jimmy Johns, and I really had no flippin idea who they were or what it was..All I knew is that I "MUST HAVE IT" according to their biggest fans and sub connoisseurs lol.  I've now tried two of the menu items...#5 and the #10 both are sooo good. It's a nice place and alternative to go to instead of the played out pizza joint when the bars let out. And for a 8inch sub it cost you anywhere from $4.35 to $5.35. That's a great deal!

I personally appreciated and loved the medical staff at  Gateway when my 11 year old sister had to utilize the E.R. a couple weeks ago. They were detailed oriented, and very attentive to her needs and ensured she was comfortable and well taken care of while being tended to.  The rooms were very nice, and the E.R. wasn't a mess like many of my previous experiences to other hospitals E.R.'s.  While we were there we made a visit to the Cafe. I've gotta say their food wasn't too bad. The pizza was great and they had a Starbucks to feed my caffeine fix. Take note tho, the vending machines are more expensive than the cafe, so take the few extra steps over there and grab your beverage.

I have nothing but great things to say about this office. I personally have had a fear of the dentist as far back as I can remember, so finding one that has been so patient, kind and overall satisfied with every visit is a relief.  My Oral Hygenist is absolutely a doll and made my deep cleaning stress free and painless. Dr. Susman, my main dentist there is also genuine and caring, and through all my questions, has been very informative, helpful and responsive. I'll be back to have two wisdom teeth pulled by my Oral Suregon Dr. Lilien, let's hope I like him after were done with the process. lol

I really dig this place. From the outside you can't tell what this place has to offer. The decor/setting is great. It's neither a dress up or down sort of place, it's really what you want to make of it.   They have a great Bocci play area towards the back with an enclosed patio. And t.v's all around so you can catch a game or what have you.  My fave drink that the bartender turned me onto was a Moscow mule Drink Recipe Ingredients:      1.5 oz. Vodka      3 oz. ginger beer     1 teaspoon(s) sugar syrup     .25 oz. lime juice     1 sprig(s) mint     1 slice(s) lime(s)  Definitely check it out if you're looking for a 'lax evening with good company!

I absolutely love what this coffee spot stands for. Organic, fresh, and supportive of their local roots. I believe Carolann is the chef, and Steve the owner are quite possibly two of the nicest and passionate people I've met through the process of them getting this locale up and going. Congrats and best of luck with Echo Coffee!

I fell in love with this place! The food, the atmosphere, the staff/management and they offer Organic, Gluten-Free, preservative and hormone free menu items. I've started a pretty constrictive diet, so I don't eat out much because of the ingredients involved but this is one of the few with a menu I have absolutely fallen in love with. I had the Gluten-Free Pesto Pasta w/ Grilled Chicken and Pinenuts. DELISH!!! It's a great spot to grab a bite before a movie or heading over to the Merc Bar (lounge). I highly reccomend checking this spot out, they have a handful of locations around the valley.

Always been a fan of Dunkin Donut's and totally stoked that they have one near me to stop at on my way to work, which is totally convenient w/ a drive thru.   I really don't eat donuts a lot these days but if I'm ever looking to cure a sweet tooth they always have them fresh. The iced coffee is perfection and if you aren't the coffee fan they have these blended drinks called 'Cool latta's' - I've only had the orange flavored one but sooo good!  Enjoy- thank me later

I have mixed feelings about El Hefe. I'm a huge fan of Dia de los Muertes so I'm instantly fan of their deccor and ambiance. It's 75% inside 25% patio with full exposure to the patio.  Now my first experience was somewhat awful. It was late on a Saturday night and the place was packed like sardines. If you thought you were going to take a step to the patio for some fresh air, think again. You'd be lucky if you made it out there or found room to stand. I think I learned that night, you just can't bring a big crowd to this location on a 'busy' Scottsdale evening.   Second experience was Happy Hour! I believe it's from 4-7 and they have a great happy hour menu for both men and women. I'm a bit partial to their Beer-goritas. , which is a 32 oz margarita and a coronita upside down in it! I love it, I think presentation sucked me in. Yea I'm a sucker.  The tables with the taps on them seem pretty sweet, and made me think about possibly holding my bday party there but the seating is limited and the booths just arent that big.   They have a lot of creative and unique margaritas to choose from and I definitely plan on making a few visits back but debateable on if this is a good birthday setting or not...

Extremely disappointed. Started off with a wonderful experience with our bartender 'cherie'... Whom introduced us to the honey hot wings, $3 bloody Mary's, $2beermosas and $5 margaritas. Our new waitress Frannie, who was more focused on bar backing than serving, came on the clock and decided to switch up the pour and pricing to $6 bloody Marys. My original bartender was still there and actually backed us and called out the new bartender on shift out and she insisted on fighting us about the pour and pour count. Sorry honey but I've grew up in this industry and I'm not ignorant. Frannie came over with the bottle and just poured alcohol on top of the drink to shut us up/make us happy but it was the principle. I'd been there for 5hrs just watching soccer and making conversation with our bartender and leisurely drinking on the $3 special blood Mary's they do on Saturdays. Sadly I will not be back. I have my thirtieth birthday next week and was planning on bringing a large crowd and making a huge function out of it after Cherie told me to contact the owner but I've got a sour taste in my mouth. Way to flip my my pov in a matter of minutes Frannie. I've never been so insulted by a bartender. Your co worker called you out and you insisted on fighting me and throwing my money back at me bc you didn't want to apologize or claim you were at fault. Smh. Shame on you.

One of the 'newer' options and one of my faves in Scottsdale by the Waterfront to grab a nice, healthy- light lunch! My mother and I both fell in love with this spot. It's casual the menu is pretty open for anyone looking for something healthy and not so heavy on the stomach. I got the Turkey Club with the slaw (which I might add doesn't have mayo) which both were amazing! The guy working that day was so sweet and being that it was our first visit, he gave us a complimentary hummus appetizer- which was delish as well. You can really taste the olive oil that everything is cooked in but it's not overwhelming at all.   If you're in the area, give it a try. Definitely one of my more favorite Fox Restaurant's.

Definitely a nice change of pace and good crowd. I say if you're going to go on a Friday or weekend night try and get a spot at the outside bar. Nate, is one of the best bartenders and makes a good stiff drink. I haven't tried the food but I heard it's pretty good and every table get's complimentary popcorn to snack on.   Again there really isn't a 'type' of crowd, it's a good mix, and a good mix of music played through the night. If you're burnt out on the same dos and iguana crowd, check this place out!

As far as the dog park goes, not a good fit overall. I've tried to visit this park a couple times just because it's soo close to home but I don't think we will be back. The park hasn't been kept up that last couple visits we've made and there weren't any doggie bags for individuals to pick up their dogs poop, which would explain why there was poop everywhere.   The size is of the park I would say fits a smaller breed of dog, but the fencing was made for larger dogs, as I can see the small breeds getting through the gate.   Sadly, we will just have to make the trek to another location.

I love the location but the service last few times I've been there has been really slow and for lack of better words is really poor. There's two specific girls that are always behind the bar that take to go orders and they just don't look happy to be there and have been some what rude when I placed my order. Will I continue to come here, yes because I love the food but always get my food to go. No reason to dine in there if the customer service is going to continue to be the same

For a beer enthusiast, like myself this is heaven. Though they may not have 'everything' that have quite a bit to choose from to please any palate. The manager that was on duty at the time, was extremely helpful in determining new beers for me to try and provided tasters before I committed to a pint.  If you're looking for a unique spot and want to keep it strictly to the hops and barley- definitely check this spot out.

For lack of better words I was very disappointed. When we got there we had plenty of time to order a drink during happy hour but were told there would be a 10 to 15 minute wait till they could seat us. They basically held a line didn't allow anybody else to get in for happy hour even when there is open seating on the patio, not cool. When we finally did order food they messed up and placed an order for a taco not a torta, not sure how you confuse the two. And I ordered the spicy margarita which I've ordered it in the past in Scottsdale it was delicious and spicy the one I ordered in Tempe was bland no flavor and not even a hint of heat. I have been warned that the bartenders were not up to par but I  usually make my own judgement and this validated that. I'd like to go back and give it a second try but there was just so many negatives in the small amount of time we were there I don't know if its worth my time.

Totally cute hole in the wall aka 'Dive' bar. They have a couple pool tables, and I happened to visit on a Karaoke night which was pretty cool. Definitely not a bar you need to get all dazzled up for but if you're looking for a 'lax spot, to grab a drink and hang out with a pretty chill crowd, then Septembers may be your bar.   I overheard them say they have Bingo nights as well... so it stay pretty active and keeps you entertained and they have a pretty wide selection of alcohol, so don't stray bc you don't think they can deliver when it comes to drinks, cause that's far from the truth!

Slightly disappointed on our visit today. A co-worker and I were approached a couple weeks ago by one of your street-team marketing members with a voucher for free smoothies. We went in today to redeem the vouchers and were advised that if it wasn't our first visit that we couldn't get the smoothie but a tea would be the substitute. While I'm appreciative of the tea, I was very disappointed that the voucher was not honored. No where on the card did it state for first time visitors only. False verbiage or failure to provide all the information is probably one of my biggest marketing pet peeves, especially since I work in this field. Just some constructive criticism to pass on: 1) update the verbiage to be more upfront about the offer 2) Honor your marketing collateral. Your employee admitted that it should be better stated and something that needs to be addressed. What's unfortunate, is that I probably would have been a frequent visitor, but looks like I will stick to bringing in my own protein powder and making it at work.

Absolutely love this place. Definitely a hidden gem you must check out. Wonderful customer service, delicious treats and custom treat packages are available for any occasion. Just picked up some colorful popcorn ball treats for our Employee Appreciation Day tomorrow and had the birthday cake flavored popcorn colored in our colors!   Can't wait to present our team with the tasty treats!
