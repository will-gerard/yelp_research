My experience was on a random Saturday afternoon, and I think that might skew my opinion a bit.  During my visit we were the only guests dining.  There was one guy at the bar that was friends with the employees.    The atmosphere is mellow.  And I can imagine it being a pretty happening place on weekend evenings.  The prices were a bit high for what we ate.  I had a pita sandwich and it was just under $10.  The lunch prices are a bit steep.  The food was okay, but nothing I'd go back time and time again for.

Let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVED the food.  My dinner was spot on.  So why the 2 stars?  Quite frankly, it was way over priced.  And I'm not talking about a few dollars too expensive.  For an average dinner, you'll be spending $25 to $30.  And while the food is tasty, the ambiance does not come close to warranting $30 per plate.

What a dive.  We went to Boston's one Saturday evening to experience the karaoke and have some cheap drinks.  The karaoke "regulars" were pissed when our group got up and had fun.  One "regular" even told the karaoke host that he was "better than this" as he pointed to us.    Stupid.  Don't go to Boston's to karaoke alone or with just one or two people.  We had fun because we were in a large group.

Yes.  Vietnamese food done correctly.  Cheap and easy to order.  If you're looking for a good bowl of Pho, they've got all of the staples you're looking for.  They also serve the traditional Vermicelli dishes.  Quantity is big, price is low and taste is spot on.  What more do you need?

I ordered mild, but the food still had quite a kick.  With that being said, I enjoyed the food.  A rather large group of us went in at lunch time and were seated quickly and served just as fast.  Most of us ate from their weekday lunch special (about $8 per plate).  The lunch special comes with soup and an egg roll.  The ambiance is nice.  Like a few other reviewers have suggested, you can't really guess what you're getting into from the strip mall appearance outside.  Our waiter was nice and attentive.  He walked the fine line between participating in our group conversation and being creepy really well.  There are a few Thai places in this area, and Tottie's is one of the better.

BE CAREFUL!!!!  Even though you are walking into a Lens Crafters store to get treatment from Dr. Irene, you are not dealing with Lens Crafters.  I went to Dr. Irene's office to get contact lenses, and I was told on the telephone that it would only cost me $15 for the exam (my insurance co-payment).  But it turns out that you have to spend an additional $60 to get a prescription!    This is a RIP OFF!  Why would my insurance pay for an exam that doesn't include a prescription?!?  The doctor was nice, I guess...but I couldn't think of anything else except for the way I was getting ripped off.  It would be MUCH CHEAPER to go to an optometrist that wasn't located in a mall.  Seriously.

I LOVE Pho.  Any of the reviews that talk about service are ridiculous.  You don't go to a Pho place for service.  And you all should know that you bring cash to a Vietnamese place (the minimum card charge is $10 at Pho Nhat).  Just get used to these facts.    I didn't eat Pho (I had a vermicelli dish) so I can't talk about the quality of the Pho.  But there was plenty of beef and shrimp in the food that i ordered.  The creepy Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck paintings are bizzarro.  And most def. a copyright infrigment.     This is just one stop (in my many) to find quality Vietnamese food in Phoenix.  Final rating: not bad.

If you're searching for some good Mexican food, you should visit Del Yaqui.  It's in the mercado on the corner of Avenida Del Yaqui (which is PRIEST) and Guadalupe.    The food is pretty affordable, and it tastes great.  I always get the Carne Asada burrito.  You should get the chips and salsa side too...they fry the chips right when you order them and they come all greasy and hot.  So good!  Bring cash though.  They have a minimum credit card charge, which is around $5.

I ate the Tacos de Carne...and they were great.  Any of the negative reviews here were about price and portions.  But my $8.00 tacos (which came with French Fries or Salad) were decently portioned, and the price was fair.  My visit was on a Sunday afternoon, so the ambiance wasn't exactly perfect.  The backdoor entrance was strange...you have to walk through the restaurant to the hostess podium.    But overall, good food.

Chinese and Mexican on one plate?  WHAT?  Seriously...it's the best thing that's happened in the state of Arizona since 1924 when they put a stop to the ban on interracial marriage (See what I did there??).  Ordering is difficult.  It's a bit more complicated than most places.  But once you get the hang of it, it's totally worth it.  If you've never been before, just let them know and they'll walk you through it (with samples!).  Totally affordable and filling...with a free snickerdoodle!

Very easily made my first appointment.  The front desk staff is incredibly accommodating and friendly.  I had no problem making an appointment...they took me in first thing the next morning.  Dr. Hajbandeh was nice and explained everything very thoroughly and didn't appear to be in a rush to see his next patient.

So freaking affordable!  The food is average cafe food, but the coffee is hot and the service is pretty good too.  I've eaten Lunch and Breakfast here, and prefer their breakfast menu.  All of the food is about $5 to $8 and their portions are rather large.  Don't go here if you're looking for healthy or fresh.  Go here if you want greasy hangover food that will fill you up for cheap.

I feel a bit silly even writing a review of Pita Jungle...I mean everyone likes this place, right?  Well I have never been disappointed by the food and I've tried just about everything on their menu (but always end up back at the Chicken and Hummus appetizer).  The only complaint I have with this location is how close all of the tables are to one another.  It's kind of tough to have a super private conversation in here during a busy time...but that doesn't stop me normally.  Pita Jungle has definitely become one of my go-to restaurants when I can't figure out what I want to eat because I know they are reliably good.

Cheap and reliable.  Just a normal gay bar with good prices and good people.  It's laid back and exactly what I like in a bar.  The clientele is more mature than many of the gay bars.

They will take care of you.  This is a dinning experience, more than it's about the actual food.  After you get over the kind of strange location - they're inside a grocery store strip mall - you kind of get taken away by the extras.  First was the amuse bouche, then the shot of cold soup, the cotton candy and then a take-home treat.  I'm not a fancy eater...just look at all of my past reviews as evidence, but I do like to getting served and served well.  Our waiter talked with us and made sure we were ordering something that we would enjoy.  He was incredibly detailed when explaining the menu.  And he let us know what he would be ordering if given the chance.  SO WHY NOT FIVE STARS: The un-pretty location, a bit pricey, totally cramped seating and long wait time.  A great experience that I would think about repeating.

We had a Groupon.  The waiter was pleasant.  The food was just above average.  The prices were steep.  We showed up at 6pm on a Friday night...and I expected to wait for a seat and wait a long time for food.  Surprisingly we were seated right away and our service was quick and easy.  We ordered the pizza that has olive oil, garlic and EGGS.  Totally strange but tasty.  It was a bit salty, but it was cool to say we've tried it.  The two of us ordered one pizza (shared) and two sodas.  Our bill was $32 bucks.  Kinda high for two guys to eat pizza on Mill Ave.  I'm doubtful we'll return just because the prices were so high.
