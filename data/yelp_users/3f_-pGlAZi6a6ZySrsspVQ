During the Superbowl many people who don't attend or host a party search for the perfect bar to enjoy the game. With the U.S. Presidential Election bearing down on the county, those of us who know, go to Nixon's to watch the results roll in, the biggest party in town. I was there in 2000, as the place was flooded with Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Independents, etc. I was there to see Gore win, then to be withdrawn. I was there when Bush beat Kerry too. If you were there, Nixon's is what a sports bar is on game night, a big game night; it's the U.S. Presidential Election, the Superbowl of politics!  This November 4th, I won't be there though, as NIXON'S BAR HAS BEEN CLOSED.   All the best to Phil, we'll miss your place!

If your looking for a hole-in-the-wall bar and you happen to live near it, Dizzy's is your place! The drinks are poured well, service is quick and prices better then reasonable (kudos to the owners). Probably the best feature of Dizzy's is the crowd, everyone is cool, seriously, you can talk to anyone in this place, everyone is a happy drunk!

Since I have posted a dog question on 'talk' today ( http://tinyurl.com/5cuox7 ), I thought I'd share a great Vet!  Roughly a year ago I was looking for a Vet for my rescued pooch, she needed her final round of boosters, rabies shot and micro chip.  I asked around and took the advice from a friend to give Dr. John Clark a try after a bit of research online.  Dr. Clark has been in practice in Phoenix for over 45 years. He is also currently the Board President of phoenix area emergency clinics; a group which is owned by 177 veterinarians and serves the emergency and critical care needs of over 300 Phoenix area practices. Needless to say, Dr. Clark is well respected by his peers; recommended by his clients and vets alike.   One of the main reasons I use and respect Dr. Clark is his honesty. I have heard from two clients, who recommended him; he will not sell you on the extras. He doesn't believe in selling medications your animal doesn't need and treatments that are not necessary. So rather than a Vet that's out for the buck, he's a Vet of sincerity and integrity. In addition, the pricing at Orangewood Animal Hospital is extremely competitive and reasonable.   The staff at Orangewood Animal Hospital is wonderful as well. I have called with questions in the past, they are always happy to help. If they don't know the answer they'll put you on hold and ask Dr. Clark, so your sure to get the correct answer to your question. If a medication is needed, they stock and sell it at economical prices. I tend to go the holistic / natural route with my pooch, so I've never taken them up on medication outside of boosters, rabies shots and micro chip.   I have given Orangewood Animal Hospital 5 stars, so if you're looking for a Vet, give them a try!  Orangewood Animal Hospital is located roughly 2 blocks north of Glendale Road on the east side of 7th street.  They treat dogs, cats and exotics.   Here is a list of services offered..............  Advanced Surgical Procedures Advanced Cardiology Complete Companion Animal Care Complete Dental Care and X-Ray Services Dentistry Diagnostic Services on site Diagnostic Ultrasonography Dietary and Nutritional Counseling Elective Surgeries and Orthopedics Examinations, Vaccinations, Surgery and Medicine Geriatric Care ICG Services Internal Medicine Medical Diagnostics and Hospitalized Treatment Microchipping Prescription Diet Pet Food Professional Flea and Tick Products Pregnancy Ultrasonography Pre and Postnatal Services Radiology Routine Health Examinations Routine Small Animal Medical and Surgical Services Routine Surgeries Small Animal Medicine and Surgery for Cats and Dogs Wellness and Preventive Medicine

1 of 5 and 1 of 1. .....Part 2 of 2  Welcome my 'Duo' review. Two bars, one of the best and one of the worst in the valley. A great example of opposites.  I hope you enjoy reading both!  First off let's touch on the name. What the 'H-E-Double Hockey Sticks' does the name Devil's Martini mean or refer to? The first, most important detail in opening a bar is the name. I don't know who came up with the name but they should have slept on it. My guess is that the name was decided upon after many drinks and shots and somehow sounded good the next day after some aspirin and Gatorade (or rather Red Bull).  I always enjoy a bar who shares a parking lot with a strip mall (grocery store, drug store, a few banks, etc), I didn't see them but what did they do with the train tracks? I know I must have crossed them going to this location. So parking and walking up there was no one in line, my mistake I walked up to the right. I was then told by the bouncers to get into the line on left. I said "what line"? His response was that I was in the VIP line. I responded, "what line, I'm the only one out here beside you guys". So I walked over and stood in front of the rope. I waited a minute then after my ID was checked I proceeded to enter.   On your way in you pass the patio, Pottery Barn coffee tables and couches, dusty flat screen TVs, kids drinking Red Bull and Vodka. I then paid my cover.  I don't understand a cover charge here? Cover for what? Does Safeway charge a cover too, their rent  /sq foot is probably the same.  Upon entering I see a large bar that shares drink orders from the patio and interior bar, with people 2 deep waiting to order their drinks or waiting to place an order. I have never understood waiting to place a drink order for more than a minute or two. First, I'd rather be at a bar that treats me like a guest, so I don't have to stand next to an attractive girl to get the bartenders attention.  Secondly, why would a bar want their guests to wait to order a drink? Doesn't it make sense to get the drinks to guest quickly? How many sales are they missing out on? How much more money would the bar make selling drinks quickly and possibly making an extra sale in the time it takes the guest to get the order in? Additionally, guests don't like waiting for drinks, so they'll take their business elsewhere, to the bar's competitors!   The place is a box, bar on either end separated by a dance floor in the center. With the usual, or rather typical Scottsdale white pillars. I've got to ask, what is up with Scottsdale and Greco/Roman white pillars? Is it a design necessity when opening a bar or a club in Scottsdale? There is a third bar elevated on one side that does not seem to get as much attention as the main and the rear. There are VIP tables, but that's it, just rentable tables, nothing to brag about. I'm guessing because it is Scottsdale the owners felt like they needed a VIP something in the bar. Servers are slow, I wouldn't knock them but at few points it was more important for them to socialize among themselves then to get to you. So the answer between going to the bar and fighting your way to the bartender or waiting for table service is up to you, its slow either way.  Waiting to order my drinks was not worth the wait. I don't know why bartenders think they are doing you a favor by over pouring alcohol in a mixed drink. If you order a Jack and Coke and you get a Jack with a splash of Coke what's the point in ordering a Jack AND Coke? Wouldn't the guest order a Jack with a splash of Coke if that is the drink they wanted? A drink poured professionally is just that, a drink with a sense of balance. I don't know who trains the bartenders but they're awful, for the guest and owners. How much money in extra alcohol are they pouring out? How much more money could the bar be making by training its bar staff better? I've got idea, pour drinks right and eliminate the cover charge, the owners wouldn't be losing any more money, and the guest would spend the money on an extra drink, if they can actually make it to the bar to order one. Drinks are not cheap; you're going to spend some money here, $8-$12 per drink, so you're paying Scottsdale prices in a strip mall bar.  My question is why people come here. It's got to be to people watch. Honestly, watching people was mildly entertaining for a short time, 45 year old guys approaching girls who looked like they used a fake ID to get into the place was fun to watch. Three guys doing shots and one deciding it was closer to hop the fence in the patio to get his car rather than leave through the exit (I hope he didn't drive himself to the ER). I did see 2 bachelorette parties, both swarmed by stumbling, incoherent guys; that was funny too. But then I realized it wasn't Devils Martini that provided the fun and entertainment is was the drunken idiots that pulled the night off for me. I give the crowd 5 STARS!

Since everyone eventually reviews P.F. Chang's, I thought I would give you all an alternative, a great, Americanized Chinese food restaurant.   The Golden Phoenix is a great example of a successful Chinese restaurant. They do excel in most ways but  fall short in others. First off, for an appetizer, get the Mu Shu, its the best I've found in town. The Hot and Sour Soup is great too, good balance of flavors. Great noodles, and rice always seems fresh. Most of the chicken and tofu entrees are cooked extremely well, as the chicken is tender and tofu is firm and sauteed well. Now for the not so good, stay away from beef entrees. As most Chinese restaurants, the beef used is from a cut that needs to be finessed, its tough if not cooked delicately, most of the time its cooked too long and gets rubbery, Michelin/Goodyear like. Stick with chicken or tofu.   As for the service and decor both are better then most. The restaurant looks like a Chinese restaurant should, bright with Asian decor. The service is prompt and professional.   As a previous review stated, they don't handle parties well, I disagree, I planned a party for 25 and they handled it quite well. In fact when the check came I tipped above the automatic gratuity (reserved for large parties).    Take out is outstanding as I tend to call in my order and pick up rather then a take out from Pei Wei (support the little guy!). To make things easier the menu is available online at their website.   Here is the web address, at this time though its not loading properly, check again if the page is not available.   http://goldenphoenixrestaurant.com/

1 of 5 and 1 of 1. .....Part 1 of 2  Welcome my 'Duo' review. Two bars, one of the best and one of the worst in the valley. A great example of opposites.  I hope you enjoy reading both!  Welcome to AZ 88. This is the perfect example of a successful bar. The name is simple, it was opened in 1988 by Kopp; a name synonymous with frozen custard, ask anyone in Wisconsin! The owners also own a bar in New York, Bar 89, and Elsa's in Milwaukee.  I have been to Bar 89 in New York when I lived there, and I've gotta say, very much like AZ 88.   Now some of you out there are a bit skeptical because of AZ 88 rep. Let me put you at ease, AZ 88 is not a gay bar, well not entirely. Yeah there are a few from the gay community but at the same time there are performing art fans on nights when there's an event. So it's as much as a performing arts bar, straight bar as it is a gay bar. Think of it this way, I find it a great place to bring a date (especially a first date) for a late dinner and drinks. Hey guys think of it this way, your date may not get hit on as much here as most bars and your date will rave about her Cosmo!   The eats here are some of the best you'll find in a bar. The Hell's Fire chips are house made potato chips, fried to order and basted with hot sauce and blue cheese. Too good not to order, a must, just don't order with a martini, it won't work with a heavy gin or vodka drink. If you must drink hard, have a Cosmo with the Hell's. The Alfredo burger is a winner too, a burger basted with creamy Alfredo sauce. Also, try the spicy, grilled chicken sandwich with jalapenos and honey. This may seem bizarre to you but it works, when you bite into the sandwich its sweet at first then finishes spicy, great flavor. Everything I've tried here is a home run. From apps to sandwiches, fruit plate to burgers, I've never been let down, kudos to the kitchen staff.  As for the drinks, you may not find any better in town. Order a Jack and Coke and you'll get a rock glass with Jack served with a small, retro, glass bottle of Coke. Sit at the bar and order a martini and watch as the bartender shakes ever drop out into your glass as the martini itself convexes over the top of your glass making you first sip a 'lean over'.  The bar is well stocked, with just about every liquor you'd expect. I judge the best bars by 1st the vodka selection, then bourbon, tequila and lastly rum. It's unfortunate people don't order more rum, especially here, they have Appleton Estate Black Label, a scotch drinkers rum, try it on the rocks; it'll change your life. The beer selection is great too, as with wine by the glass. No matter who you're with, the size of your party, everyone is sure to find a drink to their liking.   The places design and décor is unrivaled in the valley because of one simple truth, its ever changing. The artwork changes constantly. Go around Christmas and see the most radical Christmas tree ever. Hey, I'm Jewish and I go every year to see their tree! One year it was hundreds of silver painted mannequin head circulating. Another year the tree was upside down, hung from the ceiling. Another it was Barbie dolls in different color liquids in bottles in the shape of a tree, too many to count, just extraordinary. The art behind the bar changes too, from unique artwork to unique mirrors and shapes. Every time I go the place has changed, I look forward to going sometimes just to see what has changed.  As with every review I always take the restrooms into account, think of it this way, if the public areas are unclean or not kept in a acceptable physical condition it begs the question, what do the areas the guest can't see look like, say the back of the house, specifically the kitchen. AZ 88's restrooms are always clean as a whistle. They are also some of the most unique I've seen. When going to restroom the wall is the door and only marked at the bottom of the door. The hand washing sinks have a window below, seeing through into the dining room. When you go, check them out, super cool.   Seating is comfortable. The tables are just the right distance not to intrude upon each other. The long black couches recline, so if they are available, request them, after a few drinks you'll be thanking me. There is outdoor seating as well, though the tables do seem a bit closer together.  AZ 88 takes music seriously here, or rather the 'audio architecture' as I like to call it. There is a DJ booth above with an experienced DJ spinning everything from acid jazz to 80s, rock to blues, and it all works. Its nice to see (or rather hear) that the owners understand that good background music stimulates conversation and adds to the experience. The volume is always at the perfect level, to listen or have a conversation without screaming.   Since AZ 88 opened many other bars have opened in Scottsdale, no matter how many bars open around it, AZ 88 will always be a prime place for a late night bite, a drink or just a night out people watchin

The Greene House is interesting. It's California fair is a good attempt but needs to be toned down, prices too. If you go, and get the over-priced Kobe Burgers, but don't expect it to be cooked to the temperature you request!

Lisa G's is not a traditional restaurant, you've got to keep that in mind when you go, and review here.   Lisa G's serves food that is meant to be enjoyed with drink, though I wish the selection of liquor was more extensive. How 'bout some local brews too? Aside from limited liquor selection, I do recommend Lisa G's. The food is wonderfully basic, fresh and unpretentious.  A great place for a date, friends, fam, etc.

There is so much crap out there for your dog, and the big stores don't have it all. Luckily there's Wag N Wash!  First there's food.  Honestly most of it is awful. Why do people scrimp on dog food, ie; Science Diet, Purina, Beneful, Alpo, etc. These foods aren't good for your dog! Since when do dogs eat wheat? Rice? Do wolves and wild dogs eat those fillers? No they don't, so why feed it to your dogs? In my experience, if you feed your dog right your never going to the vet, really. Wag N Wash offers the best dog foods, at great prices. Foods such as Innova, Evo, Karma and California Natural (here is the website address: http://www.naturapet.com/). They also have raw food for your pooch for those extremists out there! Feed your dog well and he or she will be happier, live longer and rarely go to the vet!   Second is toys! Wag N Wash does toys well. Lots of stimulating toys that you can't find at most stores, big or small. Toys for dogs are important, unless you don't mind chewed couches, shoes, etc. Toys stimulate your pooch, they keep them happy!  Thirdly the staff rocks! They are very helpful as well as knowledgeable. They seem to be too nice, if only all restaurants greet there custumers as well as Wag N Wash!   Funny thing though, I've never washed my doggie there. So I can't rate the wash aspect, maybe one day I'll take on the "tubs n suds", when I do I'll update.   By the way yes, they do have cat food, toys, etc too!  Wag N Wash is in a few markets in the US, they also have a website that could be more helpful........... http://wagnwash.com/

Update!  If you happen to go and enjoy your experience at Wag N Wash, sign up for their frequent purchasing program. Yeah, you'll get the key fobs and card to use whenever you purchase something. There is one difference, they do send gift / discount cards! The typical card is $10 off a minimum of a $10 purchase. So far in 10 months I have received 3 of them. Great deal that really adds up!

One of the best bars in AZ, Jade is a jewel in the rough, as there aren't very many bars that offer the experience as Jade. Service can be a bit slow, but its a small bar. A great place for a date, or a few friends. The bar and attached patio is small, so on busy nights you may have to stand.   I recommend going to Jade on an off night (any night other then Friday or Saturday). Also, keep the chatter down, lets not make this place too busy, keep it a secret!

Is it me or does every restaurant fail in this location? Examples include; Ruby Beet & Circa 1900. The location is not conducive to a restaurant or bar, there is no attached parking. Needless to say, if your going to make your guests walk a few blocks from a parking garage you need to have a concept worth walking for. The Rose and Crown should have been opened in a better, guest friendly location.

I rarely give 5 stars, as I believe it is very difficult to obtain a perfect score through food, beverage, service, ambiance, etc. Christopher's new venture is perfectly Christopher, 5 stars.  First off a little background, Christopher is a native. That's right; he's a graduate of Central High School. He studied in France where he honed his craft and to this day draws his technique from. He has owned now three ventures in Phoenix, first his fine dining and bistro location on the northwest corner of 24st and Camelback (later became Eddie's by Eddie Matney, former hair dresser turned chef at Cous-Cous then Eddie's Grill) then after closing he moved to the restaurant row in The Biltmore Fashion Park, 2rd level to open Christopher's Fermier Brasserie & Paola's Wine Bar. Which in reading many reviews here on Yelp was unfortunately misunderstood. It makes me wonder if people understand what French is, it's not their fault though, there aren't many French restaurants in town, most have be closed, including Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician  and John Claude's Petite Cafe. There are a few that still survive Sophie's and Vincent's, but in this town of chains few people venture for French. Now with Christopher's Restaurant/Crush Lounge he has passed on the wine bar and opened a lounge instead. Christopher does enjoy lounges as he is a regular at Merc Bar, but then so is his smoked salmon which is offered on the Merc Bar menu. So a lounge makes sense, I'm a believer in a chef should open what they are passionate about.   The new location has a different feel from his previous; his last venture echoed a French Countryside feel, as did the food. I think that was why many didn't understand it; yes it was French, but ALL FRENCH IS NOT FINE DINNING. I wish more understood that concept, but this is primarily a beer drinking state, not wine or rather more Mc D's not Mary E's! Hence there's a difference between filling your stomach and filling your soul and leaving a restaurant inspired with the feeling that life is wonderful. Christopher's is the latter.   The design is contemporary with long lines of brushed stainless, white linen and exposed wooden beams. Kudos to whoever designed it, great job! The tables are dressed with white linen, elegant silver and polished stemware. You can't help but feel that it's 'time to dine' when seated. The walls in the main dining room have many vases of fresh flowers that seem to be replaced whenever necessary, nice touch.    The food at Christopher's is exactly what you'd expect, French, without the super-high-end prices. He's still one of the only chefs in town serving Foie Grass and Duck Confite, both wonderful and worth the trip if a glass of juice (wine) is added! I've been there now on 4 occasions and everything is fantastic, flavorful and prepared professionally. Christopher offers daily specials and I recommend them including; Veal Chop on Wednesdays, Roasted Duck on Thursday, Lamb Shank on Friday and Rabbit on Saturday. But don't stop at your entree, get the cheese course for dessert or for something sweet, the Chocolate Tower is one of the best desserts in town, hands down, no question.    Service is another point were Christopher sets himself apart. It doesn't get any better than this. Again it's NOT fine dining, so you can't compare it to fine dining restaurants (but then again there's only one left in the valley - Different Point Of View).  The servers know the food; they can describe anything on the menu and recite the specials as if their job depends on it (if you know Christopher it probably is).  Food is coursed correctly with a few minutes in between, as well as wine service is as professional as it gets. The bread service is as always, French breads with a super rich, euro butter, perfect for lapping up to sauce or vinaigrette remains on your plate.  Needless to say, Christopher does it right, in my opinion, or is it just my opinion? Many of the valley's most celebrated chefs eat at Christopher's, he's know in many circles as the "chef's chef". But don't take my word for it, ask the chef at your favorite restaurant, who their favorite chefs are in town, and favorite restaurants, most likely Christopher will make the list!  Here's the web address:  http://www.christophersaz.com/  The website is limited; menu, wine list, press release and pictures of the restaurant...
