Fatburger is a good burger.  Unfortunately, the service at this location is quite opposite. I have gone a total of three times to this location. My wife has an allergy to flour which they accommodated (Music + Burgers+ accommodation = 2 stars). The staff's "attitude" towards customers completely outweighed and took away the other 3 stars.   There was one employee that was the worst. Throughout the whole process of ordering she acted as if she didn't care that we were there and like we were causing her pain and wished we weren't there. That same employee tried rushing us out even though there were several hours before they closed. We asked politely if there was a reason why and she said no.   Then 10 minutes later, she asked us to leave because we had children walking around and they didn't want a little 2 year old who no longer wanted to sit in the high chair.  We found Fatburger to be, though they target children with their "kids meals", very unfriendly towards little kids.   Out of the three times I went to Fatburger, this rude employee was there and the third time of me being there has caused me to want to not go anymore. Because of the staff and their attitude,  which is a sign of poor management, I will no longer take my business there. In and out and Joe's Farm grill will be my choices next time.

If you are looking for the best Fili-B's type place in the Phoenix Metro area... This is it. You can pretty much order anything and be happy with it. I have been eating there for about 10 years now and have never gotten sick(except for when I ate too much). Some might say eating shrimp in the desert is risky. This is the only place I eat shrimp. Their Shrimp burrito add cheese minus the tartar sauce is amazing! Their carne asada fries are pretty good too! I have tried almost everything on the menu except for the Menudo.

A spotless house did an awesome job! They were on time, reasonable, personable, honest, and must important did a great job. I used them to clean the carpet for my rental house which I thought I was going to have to replace, but after the servicesman's hard work the carpet looked great! Please consider using him before you replace your carpet!
