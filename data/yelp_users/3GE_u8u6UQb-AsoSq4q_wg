I love this place! I have only been there twice but their lox bagel is AMAZING and the best price around, their espresso is super good as well and their staff is very friendly although I haven't actually eaten there or been there for a long time, I for sure plan on coming back more often!

Okay- I am not the one to give reviews but this time I'm going to have to say I have to give one because of the extreme lack of costumer service I got.  I had not been to this location in a long, long time, today I went and got my drink I get almost daily but decided to add something extra, the guy who was ringing me up was nice and as soon as I said I wanted some hazelnut drizzle I hear a lady yell from the back "that's an extra charge" okay... Sure I don't care. Well I got my iced coffee ms it tasted really bitter so I asked the lady if she could please pour some more 2% milk in my coffee, she proceeded to get an empty cup out and tell me that's everything's measured and that I should tell them before that I want extra milk. She was not nice about it, and I had to get her attention after about 6 times of me saying "excuse me" right by the counter when it wasn't even busy! There was no smile on her face, no being nice, just looking annoyed. In the years that I have gone to starbucks, never had I had an experience like this.

My chai was delicious.. Literally what I love in a chai latte- not overly sweet and you can taste the spices beautifully. I had been so excited to come to this place and had been looking forward to it but unfortunately it let me down by a lot. I'm in the restaurant industry and I feel like employees should make you feel like you're at home- be friendly, help you out and at least say hi or something. I walked in there for the first time and I literally got no help from anyone who was working there even though I stared at the menu for a good 5 minutes looking clueless, then I went to order and the guy who rang me up literally said 2 words to me and that was it, which were "here" when flipping the computer to put a tip and "chai" when he called it out. Very disappointed in the service here.

Okay, so last time I came my experience was not the greatest! Well I talked about how fantastic their chai was though and I just wanted to try it again. I came to get my fantastic chai and the two girls that were working today were awesome!! This experience was completely different than the one I had last time and I'm very happy about that since I'll be now coming back more often!

Usually every starbucks I have been to has pretty great costumer service, I was so excited about this starbucks opening up since is right in between my work and home. Well I have got to say that this is by far the best Starbucks I have been to, costumer service completely blows my mind here and I love how helpful they are. There is one guy who explained to me the iced coffees and a lot about one of the machines and I was in heaven learning about all of this! For sure one of my favorite spots!

So good! And our service was amazing as well, our server recommended his favorite dishes and he kept coming to our table to check if everything was going good. My husband and I loved the experience we had here and will be coming back!
