I love this place. They are always so nice and never try and talk you into extras. They do a great job and a long massage. It's my favorite nail salon ever. Fantastic pricing too!

The first guy I spoke to when I went in right when they opened was quite rude when he found out I had a groupon. I had to make an appointment and come back. The second guy was very nice. I was told 45 min to and hour. 20 minutes later my car was pulled back to the front but I waited for 30 more minutes to be told it was ready. It wasn't because they were busy either. They then tried to sell me other things such as alignment. It was ridiculous I waited that long. When I got.in my car the AC was on full blast and I always turn it off before getting out and the radio was on a different station and blasting. Someone enjoyed my vehicle. I'm glad I only bought 1 Groupon cause I won't go back.

I love this place and have been going for over a year. Always a great job and the reflexology is amazing. No actual private rooms, just walls that separate spaces. Still amazing. Great prices too!

I have been to this place a million times. I am a member which gets you cheaper massages for $50 a year. You make it up pretty quickly. Today however, I was sorely disappointed. I went to pay and the guy who did my massage didn't like my tip. I didn't tip as well as I normally do because he had to stop my massage many times to wipe his nose. It was gross. He let me know that I save $6 with my membership and that's what I should tip. Not sure if I will go back now.

The line does not move. They let whomever walks up to the VIP enterance in regardless. It's ridiculous. The music is great and drinks are a little pricey. If you wanna wait in line, not bad. I was told everyone that walks up is on the guest list... bullshit! The girl behind us in line tested it and went right in. The bathrooms are disgusting as well, doesn't matter what time of night.

Always delicious and the biggest selection of acai bowls I've ever seen. They make everything in the back room so sometimes you have to wait till they are done to place an order. Otherwise super friendly and delicious!

This place is fantastic! It is definitely for the younger crowd. They play music really loud on weekends and the lights are kept low. The food come out very quick and is always delicious. They have vegetarian options as well.

I love that this place opens from 7-9am for juicing. They have great salads but a little overpriced and need more options to put in them. Not bad if you are craving a salad and the dressings are great!

So I have been to many build your own pizza places and this one disappointed me. I am a vegetarian so I love places where I can make my own food. I felt like the different sauces were not visible unless you looked at the menu around the corner.  I asked the girl that was going to put toppings on the pizza to change her gloves and I thought her jaw hit the floor. She just finished stocking pepperoni and I don't want that in my food. (This is not the first time I have asked this at a pizza place and most people don't care) The pizza is super thin. I like thin pizza a lot but this one is so thin it bends and toppings fall off when you try and pick up a slice. The sauce is super sweet. Wish it was better.

They make wonderful pizzas to your order. The line can get a little long during meal times but that is expected. If you tell them you are vegetarian they all change their gloves and cut the pizza with a different slicer. I appreciate that. I wish they had a better drink selection. All the teas have sugar and there is only water as an alternative.
