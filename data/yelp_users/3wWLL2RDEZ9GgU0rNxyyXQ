Saigon Pho isn't the most glamorous restaurant on the inside or outside, but when you're so hung-over from last Friday night all you really care about is downing that bowl of Pho. What I like about Saigon Pho is that the staff is very friendly while giving efficient service. I did not think the broth and the meat is in the Pho is up there with the other good Pho places I've been to, but the price is spot- 6.50 for a bowl of Pho. I believe Pho Saigon won't blow you away, but will satisfy your Pho needs at a fair price point.

This isn't the fanciest looking Indian buffet.  Especially from the outside it's not located in the nicest plaza. However, I did find the service and food quality to be quite surprising. We were greeted when we walked in and went to straight to the buffet.  This Indian buffet offers a lot of variety compared to your other 9.99 Indian buffets. They had appetizers (somosas!) and a decent selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. They had both goat and lamb dishes- something you usually don't find. Whenever something hot come out of the kitchen they brought the dish over to our table and personally served us freshly made Indian food. The garlic Nann was also fresh and doughy- just the way I like it! Overall, I'd give this place a 4 star FOR its category (cheap Indian lunch buffets). You really have to try this place and experience this family's small restaurant.

I grew up in San Jose in an area where there was a decent Indian population (lots of good Indian food spots) and moving out here to AZ I was worried if I was going to find good some Samosas or Chana Batura. Little India is a tiny Indian supermarket in a Plaza with a small kitchen in the back. You check on a list of what you foods you'd like and hand it over to the cook in the back. There are tables and chairs inside the tiny market so you can enjoy the Indian supermarket atmosphere while you're eating. I recommend the Samosas and Chana Batura. Reasonably priced. While I am not an expert on Indian food- all I can say is I left happy and satisfied. Hole-in-the-wall Indian food for the win!

Hands down the best place to go look at rich men's trophy wives go grocery shopping. Or If you want to feel what living the American Dream is like- come shop here. Or if you want to up your hipster or hippie cred. Ok but seriously, this is the nicest whole foods I've been to. And I've been to the one in Cupertino CA, Westwood CA, and Brentwood CA many times. I think its the fact that there's a lot of space in AZ so they built the mothership of Whole Foods here. Great selection of foods and organic meat. Good beer selection. I come here for the 5.99 per lb their hot food on Wed, for the delirium nocturnum beer, and their organic eggplant.  Okay so 6.50 lb hot food wed + Nocturnum beer + organic eggplant + hot moms = 4 stars!  Fun facts:  On Fridays at 7:00 they have beer tasting for free or $5. Saturdays: All beer on tap are $4!

I would generally give this place 4 stars, but I think I would like to add an extra star for the friendly service I received. The two times I've been here I've had the meatball and the beef brisket sandwich- very yummy. Overall I think for the price point the sandwiches are delicious and tasty. They have a lot of interesting sauces you can try for your sandwich. The overall experience is great and I will be coming back for my yummy sandwiches. This would also be a fun place to take your family to have a sub and enjoy some subs.

Awesome! It's nice to have a Taiwanese based restaurant close to me. Please save yourself the embarrassment of looking like an idiot by coming here, ordering orange chicken or mongolian beef, and complaining about it on yelp. Come here for the Taiwanese food please (bringing a Taiwanese friend is recommend- go find one). Traditional Taiwanese food tends to use a lot of seafood since Taiwan is an Island with easy access to the sea. I would recommend trying the Oyster pancakes. Their green onion pancake is also good, but a little "fried too much" for my taste. Overall this place has good quality Taiwanese food. Of course this place is nothing comapred to the Taiwanese food I've has in Taiwan, but Taiwan Food Express satisfies the craving!

Really everyone? This pho place is by far ranked down there on the Pho places I've had. Growing up in San Jose, one of the largest Vietnamese comminutes in the country, I'll say I've been to a fair amount of Pho places. I drove to Orange County, CA all the time in college just to get Pho. I'd like to think I have some Pho cred. But hey I know this is AZ- the pho competition  is not like in CA where there's larger Vietnamese communities/restaurants. This place really skimps out on noodles and meat. Seriously for the regular bowl of pho it felt like the amount of noodles and meat you get for kiddie size. You know that feeling when you eat all the noodles and meat and you're FULL but there's still all the soup there? Yea not here! I also tried their pork and rice and it that was the nail in the coffin. The pork meat tasted like rubber and it was amazingly VERY dry. Also try not to burn the sauce on the pork- doesnt taste yummy. I hope I......wait for it......phoget about this place! Service was good though +1.

The best and most efficient workout I've ever done- hands down. When I first moved to AZ, I found Tribal Crossfit and felt very welcomed by all the coaches and cross-fitters here. Jake is very friendly and knowledgeable when it comes to cross-fit. I liked how he was always engaged during the workouts by giving out pointers on my form, tips, and encouragement. Unfortunately, I decided to pick a gym closer to where I was living in Tempe. A properly equipped Crossfit gym. Great Coaches. Great people. I Highly Recommend!

Strained my neck severely from Crossfit (thanks to my terrible snatch form) and needed someone to help me make my neck feel fabulous again.  I saw that LifeQuest Chiropractic & Massage was close to home and decided to go for a try. Thomas helped me with my neck pains and I would highly recommend Thomas. Thomas knows his stuff very well and can tell he has logged tons of hours in experience. Thomas was very attentive in looking for feedback from my body to ensure your muscles are getting the proper attention and care. I also got an awesome knee massage which was very relieving since I've had three knee surgeries. Thumbs up for Thomas! The service and process at LifeQuest Chiropractic & Massage was very professional and easy. Overall I had a great experience and would come back.

Decided to do a laid-back Friday night at this hookah lounge with a gorup of buddies. Came in around 11:00 and this place was somewhat empty- not much going here for a Friday night. Anyways my biggest complaint was that the hookah was not hitting very hard. I love going to hookah lounges where the smoke is nice and thick. I had to keep asking the server to see if he could change out the coals or pack another bowl- but gave up after the 3nd refill. I think these are low-end hookahs- one hose too...If you like house or trance music with your hookah then this is the spot.   Biggest surprise of the night was the group of guys we had had to pay $5.00 a head (girls free). I've been to tons of hookah lounges and never once have been charged a cover charge on top of the hookah we bought. More annoying since this place was EMPTY on a Friday night. Watch out! I guess these guys think they're XS or Marquee or something.

So my buddy and I walked into Upper Crust Pizza and sat at the sports bar side which had TVs on the wall with all the games on- sweet! The area has a classy yet relaxed and fun atmosphere. Right when we sat down our waitress, Aliyah, came to take our order. Aliyah was very friendly, social, and just had a great attitude. The best part of Aliyah was her pulchritudinous and mesmerizing looks- almost as she was radioactive with "bueatiful-ness-energy" radiating from her.  Aliyah, with her ridiculously piercing good looks, recommended the Fried Mozzarella and they were delicious- something new that I've never tried. On to the main dish where we had half mushrooms and half pepperoni on our pizza. The pizza came out in about 15-20 minutes. The crust I'd rate a 4/5, the sauce 4/5, could use  a little more topping to really taste them 3.5/5, but the cheese was a 5/5 since you could definitely tell that the cheese was high quality- something most pizza places skimp out on. Overall the pizza was great! However not as great as Aliyah's supermodel good looks!

I was actually quite impressed by the pizza here. I believe what stands out is the freshly baked pizza dough- the right "crispyness" with a nice soft fluff in the crust. Once of the few pizza places I would consider returning to. The cheese and sauce is whatevers but the crust is what stands out here. A perfect and somewhat classy sit-down place to go after you're nine drinks in from mill ave.

Tried their LAMB Pita- would recommend! Their Pita bread is up to par but nothing amazing. The lamb was a little dry but was cooked right and nonetheless delicous. The service was very friendly and we got our food in a timely fashion. Fries came with fetta and olive oil which was awesome. I've had better greek food from hole-in-the-walls but this place is not bad at all.

This place is another gem of mine when I need my Asian food fixture. I love their thick green onion pancake since they make it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Highly recommend grabbing the   green onion pancake as an appetizer. Their beef bun is also delicious the way they stuff it and pan fry the bun- another must try. I also tried their beef noodle soup which I wasn't very impressed by. I like to think you can gauge how good a Chinese restaurant is based on their beef noodle soup since it the bread-and-butter of most Chinese restaurants. However I think where Chou's kitchen shines is in their handmade buns and dumplings.

My company had Grimaldis cater for one of our meetings. I can't speak about the environment or service but I can say I've tried a bunch of variations of their pizza. In all honesty, their Meat lover's pizza was good but it was nothing special and same goes with their other pizzas. However, I'd only come back for their pesto pizza. It was absolutely delicious and the cheese they used was amazing.  All the other pizzas were good but not good enough for me to come back. I'd only come back for their pesto pizza. And I feel fat as hell since I ate 5 different slices, 2 of them were the pesto.

Buffet Review: $11 after tax is a pretty darn good deal. Walking in you will notice that the restaurant is very clean and have a very classy feel to it. The tables are professionally organized and set up. The atmosphere and decoration are very pleasant. India Grill has fresh baked nann and does not charge extra for the garlic nann kike some buffets do. What I also really appreciate is that India Grill also has some appetizers for their launch buffet which many Indian buffets choose to skimp out on to save costs. The appetizer I loved was a fried-vegetable-ball type!  (Not a Somosa, although I heard they have it for the dinner buffet). Overall the variety of the food selection was great and I loved their tandoori chicken. I did feel that all the sauces in the buffet were too rich or creamy which many buffets add to make the food taste "better" or "Americanized." I understand this is a buffet and the quality will not be the same as ordering per plate. They also had mango pudding with mango chucks- AMAZING! Overall this is my choice of Indian buffet in the Tempe area. India grill is so good!

After gorging myself out and going H.A.M. on a huge bowl of noodles and bread sticks in front of my date (our second date) at Cherry Blossom next door, we decided to venture over to Snoh. The shaved ice at Snoh reminded me the time when I was an obese kid eating shaved ice in the slums of Taiwan. The shaved ice texture was very unique and fluffy from what you'd imagine. They had all the sweet and fruity toppings you could want. The atmosphere was very is very fun, hip, and clean. Apparently the owner knew we both were on a date so he played some romantic music. Thanks!   Song request for next time: Careless Whisper by George Michael.

As I walk through the valley of warm-fresh-soft-moist-fluffy english muffins I knew I was in heaven. I put that muffin in my mouth and I felt this warm fluffy sensation of yummyness in my tummy. This was such a great event! I only got a chance to sample their cakes and the cakes were amazingly delicious. Their apricot cake was absolutely my favorite. The fresh mango pieces inside the apricot cake were a pleasant surprise! I ate three pieces and told my fat-self slow down and move onto the tres leches- my second favorite. The tres leches had the right creaminess and moistness- wasn't too sugary either. Their cinnamon swirl buns were also a fantastic treat. The cinnamon bun was crispy on the outside and soft and "doughy" on the inside. They also make their gelato in-house which I thought was very cool. Overall I liked that we got to hang out in their kitchen and get a sense of where all the magic happens. The staff was all very polite, friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.  I'm glad I got exposed to this amazing bakery and want to thank Lindsey and LGO bakery for making this happen!
