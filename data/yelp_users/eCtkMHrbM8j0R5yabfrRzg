All I can say is greek salad, potato salad, and Zoe's signature slaw.( not all together though, you'll explode)  I hate picnic food, but this place puts a spin on it that you wouldn't believe. I practically go broke stopping here after work every day, but my job is so demanding that I fast all day...it's worth the wait!  And if you're ever in a rush, order your food ahead of time and just pick it up...then you don't have to worry about waiting all day for your food at the high rush time (around 11pm-1pm)

Yesterday just before I was going to go apt hunting, my car started blowing a white smoke.  It must have been a sign that i would not like the apartments I was about to visit; furthermore it was a sign that my belts were waving a white flag. As quickly as I got back in I called this Pep-Boys, while not all of their locations have a good reputation...this one does.  I set up an appointment, but my car was seen a couple hours before that.  turns out my car has a nasty case of H1N1, the quote was 1195.  Knowing that I couldn't spit that right out I asked what parts could wait.  The lady on the phone was very nice and told me that I only had to replace a few hoses and of course the dreaded belt.  By doing so it lowered it to 500 and something.  She felt my pain though and gave me a 10% discount..for what I don't know, but I am not going to argue now lol.  I am very happy with the service that has been provided here.  Everyone is very nice and willing to help you out.

two star knockdown because one of the gaskets that they replaced...was still leaking! Now I have to take it back, which isn't the biggest deal...it's that I don't want to pay for having to take it back.  I have had so much better service from this place in the past...and now they let me down :( The lady who originally quoted me, wasn't there so I ended up paying 30 bucks more than she said. Good thing I have my own personal money tree!

This place is idea for those brave who already have a few bullet wounds.   Maybe some hard core tats too! went here at 8 at night and was already shaking in my heels.  Ran straight to the bubbly, that was overpriced, and then to the register. I was greeted openly by a pitbull/bulldog mix.  He smiled at my tender meatiness as I bought the booze.  Left as quick as possible. If I have any advise for those who actually like the dark side streets of East Phoenix...take the drive through.  Even though I bashed them a bit...they did have like every alcoholic beverage under the moon.  2 stars for that!  Could I suggest a paid officer or...a chain for the dog.. :/

I am rewriting this today because it sparked me when I received an email from their office confirming my appointment that is a week away. I doubted this place the first time I went there because it was a small business and their location is not very exciting.  Their office is very nice though, and the staff the second time around showed a very professional demeanor.  The Doctor even came in to inspect my teeth after the cleaning.  I was very happy that the hygienist took her time to get to know me, having a conversation with me even though I had paste in my mouth.  It's amazing how they can translate lol.  I got a goodie bag, which is always an extra star in my book!  They even give you the option to receive text messages for your appts and reminders.  I am absolutely satisfied with this place.  It only looses one star for the wait time.  My appt was at 2 and I was seen at about 220, not too bad. I have already referred two people and now I am referring you all.  And if you like it, you get a 25$ referral coupon that can redeem upon referring someone else.

I drive by this place every day...and I was honestly scared to go in until I got a tip from a very reliable source that this place was delicious. I tried simple, sweet and sour chick'n...it was SO GOOD. I told myself I wouldn't become a vegan fast food junkie but this place makes it hard to keep that promise. I came back today to try the Hawaiian burger and it was good. I might do without the pineapple next time...I know that's what's so Hawaiian about it! I just don't like baked fruit...freaks me out...  So with that said, go try it, even if you're not Vegan; a healthy cruelty free meal will do you some good :D

Let me say it, I Love subway...not this one. Sadly its the closest one to my apt. Last night though, made me wonder just a bit.  Went with a friend to get a sub. I wasn't hungry, thank Jebus! My friend ordered his sub and when we got to the counter the one employee says to the other: "what's that crawling on the floor" under his breath. My friend and I pretended not to hear as we walk out...I so much wanted to turn around and hear what it was...but I feared I would loose my love for Subway... *sigh* I hope it was just...cricket or something from outside. My friend said the food was great though... I mean their store front was clean, everything looked fresh and tasty...just...can't stop thinking about the thing crawling on the floor...

Love Chipotle so much, just NOT this location. Upon moving to this side of town from Tempe I realized that the service and taste was not the same as the Chipotle on Mill and the one at Tempe Market place.  First off the employees here were far less motivated and educated in the product as the students at ASU -_- Sadly I came in an hour before they closed, and to save time and effort they weren't cooking anymore meat.  I only asked for a steak burrito and received a crap-load of rice and beans and two lonely and terrified pieces of steak.  After chuckling  I asked for just a little more. I was told that I was given 4 ounces and that was all I could get without being charged. Sadly I ended up with a huge ass bean and rice burrito and jumped for joy when I reached those two steak chunks.  Each Chipotle has its taste..this location is not for me. If you usually go to this one and you like it...take a much needed trip to the chipotle on mill ave and you will be enlightened on how Chipotle on this side of town should taste!

Mor furniture for less is right! Everything in Mor is MASSIVE and I don't know how you're supposed to buy a whole set...and fit it in your 'less' home.  Not even going to mention the lack of service.  Then again perhaps they know you can't run out with any of their boulder sized love seats!

Tis the season to eat, drink, and be merry.  My job decided that an outing to listen to 2 hours worth of Christmas Carols with 7 roudy young adults was a good idea...I think next year we'll be doing a White Elephant in one of our meeting rooms. To my astonishment buffets are really still a hit (among most senior citizens, this is still a staple food item.) For the price, though, you really get alot! The buffet was, of course, all you can eat. The flow of traffic was easy, and there was no waiting in long lines.  The food was actually rather good, That night it was a Thanksgiving inspired menu of stuffig, turkey, brisket, salad, buttered beans, mashed potatoesm and an array of desserts.  Even ice cream! While this is not a veg friendly buffet, they at least have salad.. :/   As for drinks, and I thought this place to was too classy for booze, they are good and cheap! We emptied about 8 margarita's the size of my head the whole night.  It made the carols seem less...painful.  I would say this place is definately worth trying out.  Not just for Christmas, this place is open all year round and have very amazing plays for all to enjoy!

A married man drives up in a shiny mercedes Benz, he's dressed nice, and ready to unwind from a hard day at work.  He walks right in and directly to the left; he knows where he's going: to a booth to watch an adult movie.  he selects which one he wants to see and puts his money in.  this is what we call an adult arcade?  He's playing monkey balls, the adult version.   The other people walking in, just think its a sex shop...lube, adult toys, leather, and videos.  I went in there with my boyfriend one time, and that was the last time.  This place gave me the creeps.  Walking around the arcade and knowing that there wasn't just one person in the booths... guess they were just playing a two player fighting game...I try to keep thinking that to myself...remembering it is just an adult arcade and shoppe.  If you're going there for the innocent thrill of buying items to make your love life better...you're in the right place.  Just don't play in the arcade...it's not the kind you're used to as a kid lol.  And of course you can't go in without buying something...I bought a key chain.  :p

This place is so authentic, I wouldn't drink the water...  I was introduced to this place via a friend of a friend, who enjoyed the late night delight of real Mexican food. Guess, they just call it food. "Pause for laughter" Anyways, I tried this place once...too authentic for me but it was good! Its one of those places I spoke about. The washed out pics (cause you don't need to see them: Main theme rice, beans, some kind of meat), original spanish names for the dish, and drive thru...yes the mexican food drive thru! I love it. This places gets 4 stars because it didn't pass the health inspection report, but I still eat there despite. That's good food.

Ronald M. You are so modest. He is here all the time! I suggest a list is made of the best of the best of Samurai Sam's, because this one is really "As good as it gets!" The beef is always cooked perfectly, and you don't feel ashamed to say dark meat (chicken) please! The veggies can be skipped, but they are only there for decoration anyways :)  This place is always clean and they always have a special offer going on to college students; they understand the times, and in return they get rewarded with good business.  5 stars because they survived even when places around them are closing.  :( Keep up the good work Samurai Sam's

Tomorrow I walk for my diploma and let me say...this place got me through the late nights in Architecture school.  Of course I changed majors, but when Ron and I had to stay up till 5am working on models and drawing this place was a lifesaver.  While they have a pricey menu, you have to take in account their outsourcing wieners!  I would say to eat what you get there, and don't chance the meal getting cold before you get to your destination.  Plus the restaurant in itself is great! On the walls there are funny little comics and newspaper clippings that give this place its true character.  This place definitely needs more than 10 reviews. Try this place ASAP cause you'll be sorry if you don't.  Then you too can be a witness to the deliciousness

Tonight must be a good night! 3rd review.  I've had too much time to eat. :( Thai Basil.  An addiction I've gained from my last college dorm room mate.  It makes me sick as hell to eat it, but the yellow curry is AMAZING.  I don't even want Tofu in it, cause it ruins the coconut goodness.  Aside from the flaming hot veggies, it's pretty good on top of the jasmine rice.  The great part is, they give you more than enough to take home...and it's not bad cold either.  Asian food is never bad cold the next day *grins* The ice coffee and thai tea looks awesome...little too spicy for me. of course they choose to open one right next to my old dorm AFTER I leave. Typical Thai Basil...Typical. Try it out, it's yummy! Great for veggies and Vegans...even you poser vegans...you know who you are. Night!

OH YES! It's hard to find these restaurants in Arizona.  There are 3 signs of good Chinese food.  1. Washed out pictures of their food.  Reason: Word of mouth keeps the place going.  They haven't taken pics of their food since they opened cause it's that damn good! 2. A collaboration of tacky golden items.  This place has the Buddah.   3.  A huge a** fish tank of exotic fish.   YESSS! Oh but this place is classy; it has a piano, and a 24 hour player!  I don't know about the dim sum...I was there for actual food.  Everything was so good, only drawback was the check :0! Worth the 60 bucks!  can't complain though, I took half of it home.

FEZ was the destination for a late lunch for my friend, Ameerah and myself. Our target: sweet potato fries, which were very good as expected.  They came with a sauce that you didn't even need. It was def a mysterious sauce that we both couldn't figure out.  But overall very good. Happy hour starts at 4, we got there at 3; waiting for happy hour wasn't too hard since the service seems a little slow during the day time.  I imagine this place starts to look awesome at night where all the lights and interior design effects can really pop. Would def go again!

The last time I was here it was named something else and my waitress was dressed like a naughty cop. I was 16 then...now it has taken on a brand new face! I'm probably last to know that this place doubles as a night club.  A latin room and a hip hop club...it was amazing. I didn't get to eat dinner there so I can't speak for the BBQ but as far as the nightlife atmosphere in this area it gets 4 stars! Get there before 10, or the cover is $10 but still that isn't bad.  They have just about every spirit there, and even using the premium well is no more than 7 bucks. Will be going back real soon!!! I am still wondering how they got my number to text me specials...but i can't complain because they are sending me some good stuff.

This place kicks ass in the customer service area!  The waiter was swift taking orders, refilling drinks, bringing the food, and the bill. The special was couscous with some veggies and a mystery red sauce. Didn't matter it was good.  It almost felt sad that the whole 12" sized dinner plate was cheaper than a happy meal minus the sweat shop made toy.  Was full until now, midnight.  and what better meal to snack on late at night? A trashy hot pocket...alla cuisine! Rada and I have to have fun on a dime, so this place and it's 5 dollar special was a match made in heaven for us.   The waiters were cute...too bad they're gay -_- it's just a label right? tee hee 4 stars, good service, cute service, good food, cheap food.

Went there today for some weekly produce shopping, and I love Sprouts! Its not as pricey as whole foods, but has the same great selection of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Some advice I'd give for those new and maybe unfamiliar with Sprouts...it's VERY fresh. I mean so fresh it molds! I know in the world of preservatives who would have thought?! So if you're buying stuff like blackberries (currently on sale), blueberries, and strawberries (by the way 2 for 5!) just check before you leave the store with them.  Another great thing is that if you keep your receipt and go back the next day or so you can get a replacement for any produce that has gone bad and you didn't notice upon purchase.  It's totally not their policy, but I have had great service with this location.  It only looses a star for the selection of ready to eat foods...wish there were more meatless choices

This theatre needed the remodel, because people started to forget it was there! I went last night to see the Breaking Dawn Premier and was quite impressed.  The tickets are expensive, but you are paying to have no one under 21 in the cinema suites (the theaters with the recliners), unlimited soft drink, coffee, and tea refills.  The food comes out quick, which is good because when they turn off the lights you can't see your food unless you push it way back towards the little lights.  Don't be put off by the prices, the portion sizes are pretty ample.  another drawback is they keep all the theaters SO cold that your food gets cold :(

I only went there at first following a pretty man, I'm a Starbuck's whore. I like my fancy overpriced drinks.  I accidentally ordered a tall muscular man on a stick...later correcting myself to get a tall soy latte. After he left...I realized that my latte was good..almost...dare I say...as good as Starbucks.  I'm only bias at times because I make coffee or a living.  But when I taste good coffee I admit it.  And they are the only place that sells good vegan cookies...my weakness.   Its on the bottom floor of Nordstrom...and no better place I'd say.   Im having another affair with this place..and I'm liking it. Starbucks...my husband, Dunkin's my pool boy, and Nordstrom...my dirty filthy cougar bait!

I think I have diabetes now..but it was a darn good Red Velvet cupcake...my teeth hurt.  The store is small, but they make up for it by getting you through the line and out in no time.  I just hate those groups of kids...why can't they call ahead of time and say 'hey, we're gonna butt rape you out of your cupcakes at 2pm today" ?? The people behind them have to watch the cupcake they wanted get taken...12 times.  4 stars cause I'll go back and endure the same pain...just for a darn cupcake.  Side note: didn't know if I was supposed to eat the decorations... I sucked and licked and chewed...but It had to flavor and it hurt my teach to bit it.  I guess it's candy...thats damn hard candy lol. I'll pass on trying to consume the decor again.

Since nothing at ASU is really free anymore, at least having a free bus system (which won't be free anymore) is nice to take advantage of. Especially in the summer.  unfortunately the orbit, formally known as the neighborhood flash, doesn't quite make the free part worth it.  Sure  its nice that it goes to the little areas that you would usually have to walk to, but since it's free anyone can get on.  If you get a good bus driver he'll probably go the speed limit and stop at the actual orbit stop. Some bus drivers open the doors before they stop as if saying 'tuck and roll'.  I am not trying to get rid of the free service so soon, but if paying a little bit for better service and safety is what it takes...so be it! At least it could fund drivers that won't be texting and smashing the orbit busses into our brand new light rail system.

I'm surprised this place hasn't been review more! Talk about supporting local business! This place is amazing; from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out, smiling at the orgasmic chocolate you just bought.  Everything is made with such love, and the shop owner stands 120% behind their product.  I love it, I hope that more people go to visit because that place is definitely a rare gem in Surprise. We need a Phoenix Surprise, Tempe Surprise, Scottsdale Surprise.

Geisha A Go Go...the theme is exactly the stereotype that American's collected of Japan during the war, but the awfulness makes it a guilty pleasure for me.  After studying Japanese for six years it's hard to go to a Japanese punk/rock themed sushi/ Karaoke bar with authenticated toilets without laughing at the Hello Kitty titled martini. I couldn't build the courage to try the Pokemon inspired dish.  Too afraid it would be something electric and related to rat.  Would have loved if the waitresses had a little more spunk. I felt like I was in some teeny bopper themed beach st. hangout in Laguna.  On a good note, the sushi was cheap, but for a place also owned (and this is what I've heard) by stingray sushi...the sushi promotion should have been a whole lot better. Tip, GO DURING HAPPY HOUR.  I honestly have to go back and review it again without bias.  Maybe going in blindfolded would help.     Good thing myself and Ameerah A. know our sushi, or we would have ordered dragon roll expecting dragon! I loved the sushi bar, but wish there was seating there (that's where you drown yourself in sake and sashimi after a chew out at work) the Green seats were nice as well.  the Pachinko machines were classic. One said cleverly in Japanese 'press button' so, by pressing the button you release a Japanese Oni that yells at the top of his lungs and chases you out of the restaurant.  Haven't found that button yet have you? too busy with the spraying toilets I see. ;)

Up selling doesn't work on tires...if I had 500 to blow on rubber ...I'd get 4 tires hey, maybe 5. Or a lot of...rubbers.  Either or.  This place was quick and hassle free.  My favorite part was when the clerk told me I'd blow up on the road if I didn't replace them all today :D great customer service skills there pal. 4 stars because they did their job: selling and installing tires at a discount.  yeeey

When Tempe Market place was being put together...I though WOW a swanky place where college kids and laid back adults could get together and enjoy themselves.  Cadillac Ranch was being built...and the hype was hot enough to make you buy a meal ahead of time.  Read the reviews but thought...what they hey lets try it out.  And now I see why it has two stars...should have listened to the other yelpers -_-... went there is Good ole' Rada, thought it would be nice to enjoy the day outside.  Nearly Drowned by the ample amount of misters.  Thought to self...hmm well at least the food should be good.  Ordered the sliders meal... maybe they were scarce on meat, but the slider patties were the size of silver dollars, tasty but small.  Yes the service was slow; my glass was getting refilled faster by the misters than the actual waiter. It gets two stars in my book for the service and the overall experience (for lunch that is). you get what you pay for..and for 11 bucks, a couple barbie sized patties in human size buns, a not so 'AHH' diet coke, and 5 oz of wine (and that's on the 2.00 happy hour deal) ... kind of seems appropriate.   I recommend this if you are stuck hanging around Tempe Market place and you have just a few bucks and feel like getting close to full... and now I think that Tempe Market place took Mill Ave's charm...and they need to step up to compensate killing a once adorned chill out spot for ASU and Tempe.  Shopping is good...we could deff replace CR for perhaps Sakana? Who knows... Bye for now!

If there was a bar with an 'end of the world' theme...this place would be it. From the mosquito infested pool in the front to the booster seats available on demand...this place gets a fail for atmosphere. Perhaps it's to get you drinking faster and longer.  I went here with a friend for happy hour because it was convenient and any place with Rada is an ok place to be... sadly. I just couldn't get past the doomsday decor and the lack of meatless things. I'll stick to snobbsdale's location

After anticipating Pizzeria Bianco and not getting any, Rada decided it would be nice to give Sens a shot.  I am pure Japanese cuisine and didn't understand what Tapas was.  "Topless." I kept hearing Rada say.  Got there at a good time, and after debating whether or not to put money in the parking meters, we went in.  (Answer is yes. Even though EVERYONE else's meter was expired. MY car would be the ONE to get towed. -_-) Anyways, the decor was swanky, as expected from an asian infusion bar.  Let me say I HATE sake. but I liked their selection.   The rice wine of choice...Nigori Osake. It was nice.  they do have filtered selections, but that's more of a fire water than sake.  For the side I had jasmine rice, was okay lol.  The main dish though was a fried Yellow Tail Sampler.  Already fond of the yellow tail, this baby was a sin.  Except you were not quite sure which part you were eating.  I'm sure I got a good taste of innards :). All around 4 stars. Rada will tell you more hopefully soon.  Enjoyed the service and price wasn't bad. Definitely vegetarian friendly, and the servings are small enough for you to order a whole bunch of different things and really sample asia. Or for a couple cheapies looking for some good cuisine in downtown phoenix.  Each side dish is about 2 bucks to set a perspective. The fried sampler was 24 bucks and most other dishes were 7-9 bucks.

WOW a place where I can eat what I've been putting on my face all this time.  Dr. Weil's magic potions.  His anti-flammatory diet is great if you're inflamed...I'm not, but I like the hummus and veggies for 8 bucks.  The sweet lady that calls me sweetie when I come in is surprising but I love someone that can be THAT happy at work...brings me back to an episode of Spongebob where Squidword was afraid to NOT smile or human resource aka a big fish that beat the crap out of you...would take you in the back and 'chat'.  I hope that's not the case here but you get what I mean about the creepy happiness.  I recommend this place when guests ask me where to go  because it feels local but it's not. I like that I can say it's locally inspired.  You definitely won't feel bad eating here, but you may just run into MoJo next door to balance it out.

I don't know why I'm doing this to myself...I'm lactose intolerant, but with no soy around, and my allergies to fruit sorbet....upset stomach won.  I had the skinny white boy vanilla, which if flavored after a skinny white boy...I want one!  It felt good in my mouth, not too hard, not too runny when I put the fruit in it. It was delightful.  I only got strawberries and rasberries, but the fact that they had both was a plus! I work right across the street, so any moment I have enough time to cross the bridge in the hot ass summer sun....I'll get some more

Forgive me Starbucks for I have cheated on you...and liked it.  A LOT.  Lola is so cozy it reminds me of a true coffee shoppe! Everything is a 'for here' kind of attitude.  I had a soy chai...it was amazing! Sat down with Brooke and Mizz Rada to talk Bizzznazzz. Loved it! I might ditch the afternoon time at stuffy starbucks and take some time to doze away in a laid back place...might even ask for an application. Sorry Starbuck's...

It was the end of the day granted, but it looked like a 6 year old just had a wild fro-yo birthday party.  I had the cheese cake, but this one wasn't as yummy and tart as Yogurtini sadly. and they had no rasberries- major boo! a plus though is that is was 9 cents cheaper than yogurtini.  But that nine cent drop really shows.  I am thinking it was just the heat, but my yogurt turned into juice in no time, and floating strawberry pieces are hard to get on a spoon lol Yeey for cheapness...boo for no rasberries. Yeey because it was a nice alternative from In and Out with the family.

I drive by this blue tube car wash every day on my way home, gave it a try one day and was pleasantly pleased. You think it's just a driver through car wash? oh no, its a foam blasting, window beating, antenna snatching off tube of cleaning joy! When you first drive up you are greeted with a man, who hands you a wet cloth to clean the inside of your car. After choosing from the three washing options: the standard clean, freaky clean, and obsessively clean- you drive around and enter the tube. It's quick only takes about 4 mins and you're back on the road. Unless you choose to swing around and take advantage of the free car vacuums. All in all it's great, Only looses a star because it's violent to your car (seriously you will lose a loose antenna! and side mirrors) and it doesn't get your car as clean as a place that hand dries your car.

Gas is cheap but.....  Service sucks! they don't even acknowledge you when you're at the counter. If it wasn't for their cheap as heck gas I'd ask for the place to be demolished!   Don't go inside, just pay with your visa at the pump and go.

Ok, I don't want to hear any more complaining about how high Starbuck's prices are...this place is nowhere near cheap, but it's good.  I love the location because I can walk to it from my apartment, and that's important when you don't want to loose your amazing streetside parking space! I usually get a latte no matter where I am, but their mocha's are amazing! They don't use as much syrup as Starbucks, but if you want soy be prepared to pay a hefty price for a small.  I love walking in and hearing loud music from local bands playing. I love the feeling of an old time coffee bar, and that is worth the price.  4/5 stars only because they don't give discounts to Roosevelt Square tenants...just church going folks.  :( Either way, they will be seeing me more often.

This is going to sound more like a ramble...but I'm hoping at the end you'll get SOMETHING out of it. My stomach is picky, and it did not like the egg white veggie sandwich from this place.  I only live 4 mins away...and it was so cold by the time I got home.  I just...don't like Dunkin for anything more than donuts, and their coffee is okay too.  I am especially admiring the T-shirt I've been told about that says 'friends don't let friends drink starbucks...when in actuality friends don't let friends think Dunkin is the best coffee -_- either way I want it.  My friends think that I am a coffee snob, and I am...but when it's free and good-who cares! I'm blabbing but only because as you know I work at Starbucks and I even get sick of my drinks. But I know when things taste good...and when things taste really  bad.  that egg sandwich tasted...bad.

First of all I am overly excited that Scottsdale Mall has added this lovely addition of an West wing.  I was starting to think that Neiman's was as good as it would get *shivers* Barneys! My wallet just can't contain itself.  Anyways the little window is sexy.Hell it caught my attention.  The fresh flowers modernly placed.  can you tell I'm an architect? ..and the workers aren't that bad either. I love their selection of food..clean cut "modern" makes sense...The water selection is vast, but who are you kidding? You're there for the lemonade! Do light Ice you'll get more lol.  (Don't be fooled by the water by the way...it's just Nestle Pure Life water...in a fancy bottle and some mineral flavoring *yum*) But the sliders...the sliders...soft warm perfect buns perfectly pairs.  The sauce...dripping devilshly down the little, but supple meaty bulge.  don't bother with the lettuce.  It's cleverly advertised at "Iceburg" cause..we all know Iceburg is NOT lettuce.  I'm going on about this, but honestly this place was awesome.  I knocked it one star only because it is NOT a lunch break meal! Do not waltz there thinking that you will be in and out.  (Get the pun) These burgers are made with tender hands...and lots of love.  Patiently wait with some Perrier and enjoy the people watching.. Sweetie...Louis Vuitton and Prada do not match.  Designers need to put labels on their products.  "Do not swallow, keep away from the fashion-ally challenged, Toss after ONE year."  30th review!

Dear Frank,  I hate the Sidekick right now, but you are amazing! Your bright and shining face is comforting when I come in for technical support.  Totally not related to your job, but you rock those snazzy dress shoes!  Every time we come into the store even with the most annoying Sidekick problems. Today's mission, buy a phone for my friend's mother.  He knows he's getting some kick ass commission from us lol, so he's more than willing to help. Well at least I think he's getting some kick ass commission.  I hope he is.  I LOVE that he knows how to make an espresso macchiato ...and more excited to know he was a barista. Sexy and talented! ...straying once more from the actual review. This place gets 5 stars because with all the crappy customers they have, this place keeps it's customer service luster. Shine on T-Mobile!

I feel like a commercial saying it, but Grand Opening is tomorrow! Just wanted to spread the word, this place is also located in the West valley...it's amazing! Along with the usual Thai favorites, this place also has about 20 different vegetarian dishes to delight ALL tastebuds! They usually have lunch specials for under $10 from 11am-3pm. Other than that, bring your exotic appetite and gin tii ni! (eat here) commonly used as in 'for here' :D

I have waited about 8 months for this 'coming soon' place to be 'now open' and I honestly think it was worth the wait.  Went on opening night, and it was great. I never went to a sit down Pita Jungle, so the slow service seemed liked an eternity. I will attribute that to the new staff getting the hang of things.  I'm vegan so I was very happy that they gave a list of what was and wasn't safe to eat, and WHY! That was the best part; you could change the meal to be vegan/vegetarian.   Went today again and liked it even more than the first time.  A good drink ran Rada about 5 bucks, and The hummus sample plate was a buck and additional pita was not even 50 cents more. Amazing.  I like hummus.  You can get veggies with it instead of pita if that's not your thing.  If you're looking for beef and pork though...keep going. The only beef you'll see is in the Gyros. Burgers are veg. :D I am very happy to have this place just walking distance from my fab flat!! Thanks for finally opening!!!!!

This place is an amazing place for timid to see what all the buzz is about sushi! I have been around the block w/ sushi. The fun thing about sushi is that its all about the rice and seaweed(nori). You don't have to eat raw fish, in fact my last visit i had a california roll sans the fake crab meat and enjoyed miso soup w/ a bowl of white rice. If you do eat fish, you can indulge in the different varieties (although no different than the usual sushi bar) of fish.  yellow tail is great, better spicy. The drinks are amazing too, but pricy. I'd suggest going at happy hour time and trying some of everything since it's half off.

Welp! I lost my elite badge but I guess that's what happens when life stops. Well. Life stopped because I am having a baby! Now while I hate annoying people with all the joys of expecting, I have to give props to this store.  It was the only place I could find the ginger suckers when I was suffering from morning sickness. They have a lot of awesome stuff there though. I plan on getting my cloth diaper sprayer there, some cloth diapers, creams and butters (can't tell you what parts those go on ;)  ) If you are looking for a eco friendly baby place for infant-kid needs this is your place. The staff (mom and daughter) are extremely nice and informative!

I've tried 5 guys on Mill. *waits for dirty minds to work* and now I've had 5 guys at cityscape. I had the veggie sandwich ...it was good but I didn't feel any more veggie than usual, and I'm sure it was just as unhealthy as the burgers.  4/5 because outside seating sucks and it's hot as heck outside 90% of the time.

I didn't want to write a review until I finished my special tasting.  It was very good, I only had a few problems...but we'll get there later.  This will be my first review since I have to go as a regular patron soon. This place has a very nice atmosphere and I love how they present their meny. Under 475 calories, but let's remember that's PER ITEM lol. that doesn't mean your whole meal will be reasonable.  You actually can go over your daily alotted calories ha!  The tasting menu wasn't bad, I of course had to be the bad 'vegetarian' apple and ask for no chicken since a meatless dish wasn't provided. But they do have options for us veggies! Definitely give this place a try!

Last review of the night, had a list and now it is completely done! This U-Haul is amazing; their kindness and person-ability has proven to serve them well. I have done storage with them since I was in college, and I continue to refer friends and family here. Thor and Eddie are amazing as well as Tony.  When I forget to make a payment, they are not evil about it at all, they just call and remind me, and I pay. We keep this circle of trust going and everyone is happy! Especially my stuff!!!

It's hip, it's not starbucks, and three words: almond milk latte. 'Nuf said. This place rocks and gets my dime every time I am at the Biltmore Fashion Park.

I go here every day I have class on Downtown ASU Campus.  ALOT of healthy items to choose from including pita pizza with anything you want on it! Right now I'm stuck on a combination of salad greens with jalapeños and grilled chicken.  Good Price for the quality, and excellent service!

Uniforms for officers. Caters to PPD and MSCO Highway Patrol, and a few others I can't remember... but their customer service is amazing. Wide selection of apparel and police accessories. A little more on the pricy side, but if you've been to uniform places, the price is worth the added customer service :)

O......M......G This place was amazing.  When we checked in they were out of the room we booked so we upgraded...and boy were we UPGRADED! Jet spa tub in the bedroom and just an amazing spread altogether. I was sad we only had two nights there! When we walked into the room, the shades on the glass windows rose up revealing an AMAZING view of the strip. I can't say one bad thing about this place. The pool staff was friendly, the bartender was amazing, the housekeeping was thorough and polite, and the front desk staff cannot get enough praises from me! The ambassador originally from San Diego- you are awesome, and way to make a guest feel welcome from the first moment!  I will be returning!

My amazing husband and I took a fantastic getaway for two vacation to Vegas and as Ramsey fans we HAD to try one of this brands. Of course as a last minute trip we didn't get to his fancier restaurants, but a burger, ahem, burGR would have to do :)  The wait on this particular day was 30 mins, which I have heard is amazing .  Of course if you're an elite diamond member you get to pass the line all together and get first priority. :)  If you have to wait in line...hopefully it's not a sweltering day outside because standing next to a wall of fire is HOT!  Once seated you are presented with an iPad that shows you the desserts and alcoholic beverages. There isn't too much, so you don't get too overwhelmed. You're in, service is fast, and you're stuffed. Everything was amazing and prompt and correct! We even scored extra fries!  The atmosphere is amazing but my only complaint is how close you are to the next table. It's close enough to dare conversations...but still close enough to be too awkward.  Definitely recommend this place!

Food, great like it always is at Olive Garden. I have to complain about the customer service though. It was terrible, and I hate to complain about customer service because I have been in the same position. With that being said...I also know it is not impossible to give a customer/guest outstanding service.  Problem 1. Speed of service and accuracy of order. Wrong soups were brought, items were not brought, and it took FOREVER to bring the right items. We could hear the two tables behind us complaining about the same thing! I can only hope it was an off night...  Problem 2. At the end it, of course, took forever to get the bill and when the receipt was brought back I got someone else check! I had someone else's credit card in my hand. THANK GOODNESS I am not a horrible person who was desperate for gas or something. I ended up giving the server 6 dollar tip, which I can't say he deserved. The manager staff couldn't find my change?! I was too fed up to care about 6 bucks. Complete fail for this location.
