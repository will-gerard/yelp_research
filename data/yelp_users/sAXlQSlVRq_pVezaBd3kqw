The book buyer is extremely rude, very put out to do HER job. I won't be returning. My husband had the same experience yesterday and I decided it was time to write a review. He ended up giving a nice bum some great books.

Authentic sushi in Arizona, loved the spicy yellowtail roll, our friends liked the Vegas roll, and miso soup. 2 couples, total bill 80.00, 40 per couple and this wasn't their happy hour as it starts at 8pm.

I love their Hot and Sour Soup..but order a half size or you will have left overs for a month. Their Mongolian Beef is really good as well.

Gluten free people need Tamari, I understand you have soy sauce but that doesn't help me, come on Sakana, we come here so often, it's 3 dollars.

I decided to visit this location as I was already headed to Whole Foods. I should have stuck with my local store where most the girls know me and are helpful. I was returning 3 bottles of product Two of them had exploded. The first thing the cashier asked me was "Did you leave these in your car? You know it's hot in Arizona" I let her know they exploded all on their own, under my bathroom sink (Lovely). She called her manager who wanted to swap them out for new, I said no thank you and that I would appreciate a refund. Both were irritated with me at this point, one told the other how detailed a return has to be and that she would have to clean the messy bottles and add them to their return's box. Aren't you being paid to work?

Slow service, sloppy job. Pushy sales people, this definitely will be the last time we will be coming here.

We went to Arrowhead Grill on a Friday night and had an awesome time! There were four of us and we all Loved our meals and the service was excellent, which is why I decided to write a review as most are negative for this establishment. I had fish which was a recommendation of our server, it was perfect. My Husband got a steak which was also delicious and prepared to perfection. We ordered the asparagus and potatoes for our side dishes and a salad. They complimented our meals perfectly. Our friends got taco's and steak and loved their choices as well. We shared a bottle of wine and enjoyed a fabulous evening. We will definitely be returning, it is a bit pricey but hey, you get what you pay for!

We LOVE this place! I haven't had an egg roll in years but they do traditional Thai and use rice wrappers for theirs! And the pot stickers as well are rice wrapped! Sweet basil is delicious, I've had the spicy noodles with out soy sauce, bamboo shoot dish is delicious as well!

Open on Sunday! We shared thai basil and a pot of tom yum soup. The service was excellent and we liked our dish so much we ordered another one to go. I also loved how clean and neat everything was! We will definitely be coming back.

We were at squid ink last night w our party of 8. They were packed at 5pm. We decided to sit outside being there was a 40 minute wait inside. Its weird how some visits to this place are amazing, the food is wonderful, great service etc etc. Last night our food came out in rare form. Sweet potato fries that had a thread in them and seemed bottom of the batch. Our sushi was good...just small portions of fish, we had a philly roll and spicy salmon. Our Garlic Edamame had 3 Garlic pods. My friend got vegetable tempura which again, looked like small end of the batch pieces...we are on a break as of now from this place. Hit and miss at best.

We loved this place! And it was by complete accident that we found it. We ordered three small plates for their happy hour. The Spicy Shrimp dish was delicious, along with the mushrooms but the crab stuffed peppers were not a dish we will be revisiting. We also really enjoyed the bread and garlic dip. The Service was great! Our Waiter had a great personality and was full of suggestions. Be prepared, happy hour prices are great on food but not on wines by the glass. Great Place to go and I highly recommend it!

We went to Rice Paper on a Wednesday around 2:30. They have all day happy hour so we both had Sapporo's and ordered Beef Pho and a Chicken Sandwich. They only serve on trays AFTER 4pm. Our server was great. The Pho we both Loved and we are picky. The sandwich was OK, honestly I wouldn't order that again. The bread was tough, the chicken had great flavor but there wasn't much of it, they also put fresh cucumber and carrots with it. The Garlic fries were delicious and came with a Great Dipping Sauce. The decor is very modern, definitely a surprise. It is small so I'm not sure we will head there for dinner anytime soon. But for lunch it's a great spot. It is pricier then other Vietnamese Places we have been to but I'd rather pay more for a clean place to eat. They seemed to constantly be cleaning, and I love seeing that!

We Frequent here about every two weeks. They have a great Happy Hour. The Wait Staff is Nice and helpful. It's always very clean which I LOVE. I really like the Filet Mignon Salad, Rice Noodles (Vermicelli) with Chicken, All their spring rolls are delicious and I usually have a Ginger Fizz..as far as cocktails go it's my favorite.We also like their Pho but it's been to hot lately to enjoy it. Sunday's are great to visit this place as it's usually not busy between 3-5. We've been on a Friday night and it's just really busy and loud. But if that's something your ok with enjoy!

This was by far the best sushi I've had. We went with friends on a Friday evening at 6. They run an amazing happy hour! I'm gluten free and got ridiculously excited when I saw the GF Tamari. They can make gf vegetable tempura, or the stuffed jalape√±o poppers. We order a lot of different items. They also have Chinese dishes, I had the a spicy chicken dish which was delicious! All the rolls we got were super fresh and had a great serving of fish. I'd definitely recommend this place!

Ok first I will clarify, I do rent a room here as I'm an esthetician, skin queen, waxer and bronzing specialist. I could go anywhere for the following services but Love the quality I've received. Picky to describe me is by far an under statement. I see Gustavo Felix for amazing, healthy blonde hair. His color placement technic is beyond all the years I've had partial highlights put all over and damaged my hair. Im thankful to have been educated on why that is not correct.   Next is Rosemary Ramsey, she does shellac on the hands and amazing Pedi's with Opi Polish. Love getting pampered by her!  Vilma Blum does NRT and Massage Therapy. She's helped with pulled or strained muscles and also gives a realllllly good massage. Wether your looking for therapeutic or pure relaxation she nails it. She's also a registered nurse.

I really wanted to like this place. First off I asked if they make their lumpia with rice wrappers as that's the way my friends in Cali have always made theirs. No, they use store bought wheat flour wraps. Next I asked if they had gluten free soy for a noodle dish, again, no idea what wheat is or what or what did not on the menu contain wheat. After explaining the waitress just brought out a few things for me to read the ingredients. I got a noodle dish. Gray chicken and a few veggies were included. Overall nice people, not a good place to eat.
