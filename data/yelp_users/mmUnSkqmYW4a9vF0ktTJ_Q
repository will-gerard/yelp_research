The Kierland Corporate Office Center is a phenomenal place to conduct business. It has an unmatched level of service provided by Debbie, Kristi, and Erica who always have a bright cheery smile on their face everyday! If you need help they'll get it done, fielding lunch deliveries, moving you from office to office, and making sure all your connections are up and running are just a few of the wonderful services provided by this great staff. I've been in an office here for roughly 3 months and have been floored by the exceptional service provided.  If you need a SUITE office, (no pun intended) come and talk to this crew, they are great and I'm sure they will get your business operating at full speed the moment you move in.  Fantastic service, fantastic staff, and fantastic amenities!   Just a FANTASTIC office!

Update** Pt. 2: Dave, the owner (apparently after seeing my review) came to my office with a fresh sandwich in hand. However, I had already found something else to eat so I was full and did not try his new sandwich. But, I do appreciate this type of service and apology.   Pt. 1: Not only did my order take well over an hour and fifteen minutes, but by the time it got here the wrap I had ordered was soggy and gross. The soup I ordered was cold, and it has you choose a side for your sandwich (or wrap in my case) and I chose potato salad...no potato salad even came with it...not even a different side. Simply my soup, and a wrap (both pretty much unedible).  I use GrubHub (from my home and office) multiple times a week and will never order from this place again. Avoid at all costs.

There were pros and cons to this place...  Pros: Egg Rolls were great, Chicken Skewers were delicious, and the Pork Fried rice was good.  Cons: Delivery took over an hour and I live 3 1/2 miles down the same street. Over priced for the quality. Food was cold upon arrival. The Pu Pu Platter had 2 of the smallest pieces of shrimp I've ever seen, a chicken skewer, an egg roll, a bbq spare rib and some unknown fried piece of imitation seafood-$9.75 for this??? Come on...  Overall, while the majority of the food was OK, I don't think (like most have said) that it is anything out of the ordinary for a rinky-dink chinese delivery place. Definitely wasn't good enough to have an hour wait time on some delivery.   Unless you are CRAVING some Chinese and literally have no where else to order from, I'd be hesitant to order from here.

I found Mac Masters on a google search and figured I would try them out with an iPod Touch that had a shattered screen. I bought the replacement screen kit online for $25 (Amazon) and followed a youtube instructional video on replacing it. I didn't get the screen to come on but heard the iPod still working. So I called Mac Masters and ended up bringing it in for them to complete for me. After a $45 diagnostic charge and 14 hours later I get a call telling me that unfortunately, the cable for the volume and lock button was cut. I don't recall cutting any cables as I was extremely careful when handling the device as I followed the youtube instructions which told me exact ways to prevent the cutting of any cables.   They said they could fix it for $109 and there was NO negotiations (everything in life is negotiable--I'm in sales). This was after already paying $45 for the "diagnostic check".  I then received a call an hour or so later from them now saying that the cable for the NEW SCREEN that I just bought was cut as well. I know for a fact that I did not cut any cables on the part that I brought as they were all attached when I brought it in.  They told me the charge for this addtional was normally $154 but they would do it for $54. So, now I'm at $45 + $109 + $54...$208!! This 4th Gen iPod is all over Craigslist for $100-$120---and that's for 16gb and larger...not that 8gb that I'm trying to have replaced.  I said no to their offer of charging an additional $54 and it was ludicrous that I was look at $208 to fix something I had started and bought the parts for. When I was told initially over the phone that the total cost wouldn't be more than $139 if they had to replace the whole piece and I bought the parts from them!!  The response from the guy on the phone was what drove me to write this review..."not to be rude, but we aren't the ones who told you to go do this repair on your own".  What an awful way to try and appease a customer. There's a reason you tech geeks are stuck fixing stuff all day and don't have anything better to do than rip people off.  I am now thinking of these guys in a way I think of Firestone (the auto repair company) you go in expecting one thing and what seems to be a legit price and after the "technician" works on it and causes other issues, now (unless you are an expert in the field) you are told about a million other issues that end up costing you a ton of money.  AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE. THEY ARE A RIP OFF AND A SCAM. THIS ALL HAPPENED TODAY AND I HAVE ALREADY GONE AND BOUGHT A PERFECTLY GOOD CONDITION IPOD TOUCH 4TH GEN 16GB FOR $90 FROM CRAIGSLIST. WAY BETTER DEAL!
