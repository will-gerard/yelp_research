I really don't understand this McDonald's... This is the closest McDonald's to my house without having to get out of my car at Walmart... But let me tell you!! Probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to as far as customer service and overall service.. They're never on time, my fries are always weak and if I order a large they never give me a large serving.. Always a medium serving in a large container... Its safe to say I'll be using the Walmart McDonald's or take the extended drive to another location..

I just went there for lunch today, the service was cool and the food was hot..  Some homeless dude did ask me for food while he was sipping on his smoothie but I just ignored him....
