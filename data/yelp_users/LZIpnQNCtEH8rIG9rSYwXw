This is not the ideal location for a desired private atmosphere. It was a noisy, our table was sticky and unsteady, service was slow (though friendly), and food was just okay for the money spent. We will likely not return unless for the Happy Hour atmosphere and prices.

I come here often to wash the family cars - they have cheap but thorough deals. The service is typically friendly, and the seem to remember the cars that I bring in, if not me directly. Because of the reputation they've built with me, I decided to purchase a full interior detail and ultimate wash for $120 - something I thought was a great deal.   I just left the car wash to enjoy lunch at Applebee's across the way, and am pretty disappointed with my car wash experience. Before I left, I reviewed the car and had to ask them to (re)shampoo the back seats. There are stains from the previous owner that I wanted gone; the entire purpose of my purchasing the interior detail! They did, and it looked great. After getting to Applebee's, I looked at the rest of the truck and realized that the front seats weren't shampooed either, despite them being covered in plastic..? While I should go back and demand more for my $120 plus $20 tip, I am fully frustrated and won't be returning.  From here on out, I'll take my personal vehicle to a place closer to where I live and get more (and honest) bang for my buck. If I'm spending nearly $150 on a detail, I want it to be PERFECT!

I have been coming to Moriah regularly for the past few months. I typically get a full set or fill, depending on the need. I always ask for Ana - she's the best nail tech, very friendly, and always remembers me and my stories. The price is a little high, but it's totally worth it considering the other horrible experiences I've had in the area. I will forever be a regular client.
