Very inexpensive place to get custom tshirts made!!! Great service and QUICK turnaround!! There is very limited parking that would only be the downfall :(

ordered food while at work not only did we get about food over an hour late  but i've had better frozen eggrolls than this place and the rice was terrible. Definately have had much better food in the valley.

Great bingo after dark! Cheap (7 bucks!) and fun. Its like cosmic bowling but for bingo! The staff are a hoot and I LOVE going there every Saturday night!

Red velvet is to die for! Best cake you will ever have! They have mini bundt cakes and its very hard to drive by the store without stopping and getting one! Best way to satisfy your sweet cravings!
