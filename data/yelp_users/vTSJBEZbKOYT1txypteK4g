I HATE this place. The water is GROSS! there is not one patch of grass for my dog to run in and it has such horrible lighting at night. They also dont really filter what kind of dogs can be in there. I drove a long way to come to that park, and I left asking myself WHYYYYY! I'll stick to Chapparal dog park in Scottsdale.

5 stars isnt enough!!! I love the whole Briggs family. I have been going to this dentist since I was 8 years old and they have always been so amazing to me. I love that I walk in the door and they make me feel right at home. They are so sweet and everything in that place is actually super comforting.  They use the most high tech things I have ever seen, and its good to know I'm getting A+ care for my pearly whites. I recommend them to everyone I know!

So. My car has synthetic oil and last time I had an oil change and the same car wash I paid 40 dollars....... This place told me it was 70 dollars.... For an oil change. None of them were friendly or could give me a breakdown of why its a 30 dollar charge. These people won't get my business again.

Not sure I'd label this Mediterranean, but I WOULD label it yummy!  I had a pizza and my boyfriend had the clam appetizer and we were STUFFED. I ate the whole pizza because I couldn't stop. If you want a CUTE little restaurant with good food, good views, and some great beer and wine, Cave and Ives is for you.  If you're thinking about it...stop. Just show up :)

This place is authentic as a NY Bagel place can be. They're also willing to let you try things and make sure you're experience is one you'll talk about. Glad local businesses like this one are here!

I can start by saying, their food was GREAT. I had a pizza with an egg which sounds crazy until you have one. I cant complain about the food one bit!   My boyfriend loves beer, so this place to him is a no brainer! Their beer list changes literally daily [they changed 3 different ones while we were there] so you gotta check the menu when you're there.   However, I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I do enjoy some cider and a glass of white wine on occasion. My only wish for this place was they had a few more ciders. Guess I'll have to go back to their revolving beer list to try again!  Also, I thought this place was super hipster urban and fun. They have a great patio as well. If you're downtown, CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!
