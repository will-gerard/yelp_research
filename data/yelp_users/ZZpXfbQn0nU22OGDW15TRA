I went to Dr. Walker for a long time. I thought Dr. Walker was a good dentist until I changed dentists. I had an issue with the front receptionist(his wife) who kept telling me I had a deductible to pay. Least to say - one phone call from me to my insurance company(which the receptionist could have done) was all that was needed to clear up the confusion.  By that time I was pretty ticked by the way the receptionist treated me so I decided to go with another dentist that was recommended to me by a friend.  Problem started when I went to the new dentist to have two cavities filled that Dr. Walker advised me of at my last cleaning(1 month prior).  Well it turns out I had 8 cavities and one was from a prior fill that Dr. Walker had completed approximately two years before. I understand missing one cavity but 6 others? Are you kidding me?! Not only that but I went for a second opinion to make sure I wasn't being fooled but modern-day medical over diagnosis. That dentist also confirmed the truth - 8 cavities and a possible root canal if the prior cavity filled was too deep to fix. Not only did they show me the x-rays but also the photos of the black holes and pits.  Several had been there for more than 6 months and probably more than a year. And I go to the dentist every 6 months - I like my teeth clean and that awesome feeling that there are no icky cavities.   Just an FYI - Dr. Walker said I had stains on my teeth and they were definitely not stains. I felt mortified going to two different dentists and having them tell me my prior dentist wasn't telling me everything.

Walking up to this place I was kinda nervous... definitely a hole in the wall. Almost like it was a baja fresh at one point but O M G I can't believe the food. We walked in - total noobs to this place and checked the menu while in line.  We sat down for about 5 minutes before we heard our number come up and it was BUSY. Busy as in 5-6 people were ahead of us but we were ordering within 2 minutes.  The food is served on styrofoam plants that are cheap but the food... man I'm glad I found this place. I put this on par with Si Senor and Rosa's Taco Shop but... more casual if you can get more casual without losing clothing.  My favorite was the tacos - the street carne tacos are so well seasoned. And the refried beans - unique taste and very flavorful. And for $6 I got a plate of food that filled me for two meals easy.  I actually didn't see the Diners drive in's thing until we sat down and saw the painted stamp that Guy put on the wall. I had seen this in a few other places in town which was a good sign. I'm positive we will be back here several more times.

Great HH - totally fun place. Nice clean bar with tons of TVs. HUGE selection of beer on tap. Service was fast as we had multiple people stop by to check on us when we were in last week. We got a mini pizza and some salads which were fresh and had a really flavorful house dressing. We'll defiantly be venturing back during the football season.

Best Gelato in town. Better than any self-serve yogurt place by 100x. This place actually has ever flavor just right and there is no weird chemically taste. I do 1/2 and 1/2 of the dark chocolate and coconut or the Panna Cotta and hazelnut.  I have been known to go  in and buy a few 1/2 gallons for party's since it is THAT good. They let you taste the flavors before you commit to also and the employees are always really friendly.

Love this place!!!!  They are the most detail oriented nail salon I have been to. Their flowers and designs are fantastic!(see my photo) I also like that they have Zoya polish for those of us who are a little conscious of the chemicals in regular polish. Foot massages are great and they take time to do both manicures and pedicures to your standards. I've been coming here for over 3 years now and this is my #1 nail salon.

Just take your cash and burn it... this place does not wash your car... just rubs the mud into the paint. We paid for the $16 wash and afterward was unable to tell if they washed it or not. They must have used dirty towels to dry the car since the black showed all of these dirty streaks everywhere which also appeared to have scratched the clear. They also didn't tell us when the car was done so we were sitting there for 20-30 minutes before going out and having to find our car that was parked across from the wash and not even next to it. For $16 you can at least use clean towels to dry the darn thing and make it looked like it was washed.  Not brush-less, not friendly and definatly didn't do even a mediocre wash at best.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE!!!    They have Buy one get one free coupons in the monthly coupon mailer book and Wednesdays are Family night which have their own specials.  Their Happy hour goes until 7:30pm which is the longest Happy hour around. Also they have daily specials for margaritas and specialty drinks(prickly pear marg is the bomb). $2.75 pints and $8 pitcher of domestic beer on HH too.  This is going to sound strange but they have the BEST GRILLED WINGS!! I would have never thought to try them, but we smelled some as they went by and had to order a dozen. They were SO tasty and flavroful! And from a Mexican place?  We haven't tried the burgers but we heard from other people that they were good too.  The Pork Verde is super DELICIOUS, and HUGE!  I really haven't had anything bad from Luna either. We are here often and each time we always see a new magic trick from Chewy - the awesomest bartender!  The service is quick and when something comes out wrong, they quickly remake the item and it's out without 5 minutes.    The patio has the best view of the lake too since it's in the center. They have tons of TVs, fenced the ducks off the patio, misters, both pubs and tables. It really can't get much better.  I mean, maybe if they had recliners or something but for now I'm all positive and give Valle and big thumbs up!

It's no longer Planet beach - it's now Tangible Tanning. -"De-franchised" was what they advised me although the contracts with Planet beach are still/bought by them. Say bye-bye to the half off after being with PB for two years. I think I'll be going elsewhere now.  Especially for over $55/month for the 'basic' membership. Rip-off!

I don't need to say anything other than Grilled Veggie Lavosh Wrap. Jaw... drop... floor. And the spicy garlic potatoes... can I please steal your recipe so I can make those every day of the week?   I'm always amazed by PJ. This location has "the lake" which has an amazing view and PJ has wonderfully outfitted their patio so you can sit outside for all of the seasons. They have several heaters outside, plants, flowers- Just beautiful. The inside has dark wood tables, a giant ornate mirror in the back and pictures/paintings on all of the walls.   They had me by the first sentence but I also absolutely love their falafel platter, thousand bean pita- (DE-Lisious open faced pita), and of course the hummus. Their happy hour is seriously ridiculous!  Hummus for a $1?!  I know, I'm getting carried away here but it's true! Their food is fresh, bursting with flavor and priced for what you get. I never eat my whole meal and always take half of it home with me. And they even give you a to-go cup for your drinks (non-alcoholic that is).   This is a place I can go eat, not feel guilty, stuff myself and have a good time with friends and family.

Absolutly love this place. Out of all of the places I have reviewed. They get they 5+ of the 5. Not only do they have tasty coffee that is un-burnt, un-adolterated and un-starbuckutated, they have REAL BARISTAS. They can always recommend, create and give you what you are looking for.  When I bought my first espresso machine, they gave me instructions on how to get the best results from it. The baristas are always bright, friendly and quick.  Even when I'm having a bad day I can't help but leave with a smile afterward.  I have been here through finals, break-ups, hard ships and just plain simple moments I wanted peace. The lake is the perfect setting for all of these and nothing less.  The coffee would be just as good without the lake, but the ambiance is truly made by both. I hope coffee rush is around forever. It is one of the best places to enjoy life. Simple as can be.

Awful!!!! Will not be going back!!    I'm a pretty relaxed, forgiving person until you do something thats industry unforgivable.  Like making a table wait for an hour... at a fast food place for their food. BAM!! DONE! NEVER GOING TO GO BACK! You do have the option of sitting down, but even the people getting their orders to go were waiting 30+ minutes.  And with all of the other AWESOME mexican places around.... what the heck??  An hour... a true 60 minute hour. AND the worst part... we were not the only ones who waited a LONG time for the mediocre food. In fact, the entire place... EVERY SINGLE TABLE(~10) were full. It took 10-15 minutes just to get our drinks which were diet cokes... you have a soda fountain, just take the order, fill the drinks and let the people sit with their drinks.  And when they did serve food, it was one plate at a time... took a good 5 minutes in between when I and my boyfriend received our food.   I place every other mexican food restaurant, including taco bell, in the phoenix metro area, ABOVE this place. It cost $19.20 for a two taco combo(2 tacos- street style with rice & beans) and a taco and tamale combo(taco, tamle + rice & beans). ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? And the beans... AS RUNNY AS WATER!!! So gross!!!  I tried to mix my rice/beans together but that didn't help anything.  We went here on the recommendation two friends of ours... both are older... probably don't like as much spice and flavor as we do but the burnt meat in the El pastor tacos- unacceptable. BLACK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE MEAT. The tamale tasted like it had cinnamon or allspice in it too.... totally not mexican and very gross! My reccomendation, go to Los Favoritos.

Awesome little bar inside. Almost italian-esk but its located in the center of the restaurant which is odd. The spicy bloody mary's are nice and they have very creamy crepes. I had a hair in my food and they promptly took it back and within a few minutes a new plate arrived at the table. The manager came out to make sure all was ok and then they comped the plate due to the hair. I like to decor but it was oddly set up. A little of everything we americans think is "european/ french" Not true french but decent americanized french place/food.  Crepes + but over all - its about the same as an olive garden.

Well, after their remodel the place no longer smells like a toilet!  And they did some other things right too.  The food - definitely stepped up at least a notch if not two. I go here for their unlimited soup/ salad combos. They have regular and premium salads(in smaller portions) which are unlimited, and you can swap and try different combos of soups and salads.($5.99 and $7.99 I believe are the prices for the regular salads vs premium salads). Premium gets your the asian salad, spinach bacon and something else. I like they added low-calorie/ more WW friendly items too which are pretty tasty. I tried their jalapeno shrimp grilled plate which was flavorful but not spicy. And I like spicy. So for all the bland people this is probably more aimed for you.  I'd put it as a 1 chilli from Arribas or the baja spicy from Macayo's... doesn't touch los dos though with a pinky though.  The beer is still ice cold, and although they changed their prices recently (they were super low for their re-model/re-opening thing) they are still really good for happy hour.  There are a lot of regulars here for happy hour from what I've seen which can get loud.  Overall they've taken a step away from their old drive bar scene and brought it back to a decent place to eat and have a good time.

I'm a fan, not my favorite sushi place but dependable and reasonably priced for what you get. Service is always good, not great but good. Right now due to the remodel it's been rather dead so the service has been quick. The sushi tastes fresh and we haven't had any issues with the rolls falling apart.   The remodel looks like it's going to be very schwanky too once it's complete in November. They have some new menu items that we tried out this weekend and very delicious. I couldn't remember the name so I took a picture of the appetizer we had and also posted it.  Try it - it's actually really good!

This is a last resort store now.  We've been shopping here off and on for several years... and since the remodel it's almost impossible to navigate the store.  Their re-model made the aisles much smaller than they were before.  Now you can only fit 2 carts next to each other at a max. There are tons of stacks of random food/items in each aisle - another thing to avoid hitting.    This Fry's is always out of so many things: organic milk, organic produce, cheese and the selection changes it seems weekly. I think they now carry less than they did before the remodel and now they just have larger quantities of certain items.  5 rows of ketchup in 3 different size but no Ken's sun-dried tomato salad dressing...?  Also they re-modeled the produce area... again... and now it's harder to find items, bags and where the labels are with pricing etc.   That and they got rid of the nice greeter who was there for years. I mean, you're doing poorly so instead of listening to your customers about why they don't shop here anymore they fire the greeters? Logical.. obviously.   Since it's 'hit or miss' with this store I've been shopping a lot elsewhere where I know they will have certain staple foods(milk) in stock.   That and the crowd... I'm not sure if it's because it's a Fry's or Kroger but sometime when I'm here I feel like I'm in a Walmart. I understand if you just got out of the pool and are stopping by for a quick item or two... but put pants and a shirt on first.

Lunchtime Sushi!!!  And make sure to get there by 11a since some days (Thurs/Fri) they fill up quick. I probably get the sushi boat every time I go here for lunch. For $9.99 you can't beat it and it's has all the variety of rolls, sushi and tempured (I know it's not a word but I'm using it) goodies(jalapeno roll). It also comes with soup and a salad. The whole boat is large enough for two people... or one hungry person ;P I've been coming here regularly at least every other week if not every week for over a year. Never gotten sick or had a bad experience. Also - ask for separate checks up front - or you'll wait for them to separate the orders out.

I really like this place. For lunch it's quick, easy and tasty! I went here a few weeks ago with a co-worker and got a lunch to go. I had the veggie freak with a cup of white bean soup. OMG. It just tastes wholesome! Not heavy, not buttery, not gross. The lobby is clean, kinda small but still has the mom and pop feel to it. The menus are written in chalk on the wall and are colorful and friendly. I don't know if I'd go here to sit and eat inside due to the limited space (4 or so small tables) but it was terrific for lunch to go. The sandwich had an Italian dressing on it which was very refreshing and fresh tasting. And the lady who brought out our orders even told me to be careful with the soup in the car. Aww, I don't get that a paradise bakery or subway when I'm getting their soups.  I hope this place stays right where it is since I have a feeling my co-worker and I will be back for more!

YUMMY!!!  Today I got the chili and a 1/2 veggie freak. Had it delivered and it was right on time. Key is to make sure you ask what their time frame is in case they already have a lot of orders in. So delicious! Monday is starting to look better than Grumpy cat!

Ahh lavosh.... they some AWESOME flavors!!! Great little sports bar that's still family friendly.  Clean, good service and free peanuts! Nice large patio outside in the front with TVs and plenty of TVs on the inside. The daily menus are great. I haven't had anything bad from those yet. We had a white Mediterranean lavosh that was a special which I wish was always on the menu.  They have groupons for 50% off pretty often which is a big plus but even without the prices are reasonable.

Two words.... Adult Milkshake.  They use real ice cream in their milkshakes. My favorite is Oreo cookie with chocolate vodka. I only trust them to make them. And I know how much of a pain in the butt that they are to make. In the time it takes to make one shake they could serve 20 regular tap beverages. I thank you teakwoods.  Whenever I need a treat (and it's only a few times a year) this is it.   The lavosh is also amazing here. I always pick their daily special. Last one I had was a Tuscan veggie lavosh with white sauce. So yummy, and perfectly portioned when shared.  Oh and the boyfriend and I shared nachos a while back with chili on top. Chili nachos... drool!  I wish I could have treats like this more often, but it is probably a good thing we are only here one every few months. It's not the closest place to us but we always seem to end up here all gross (after moving, yard work, painting, house work etc.) I like that it's casual and really laid back. Free peanuts are the best!

Never going back, Period.  Where to start...  First - VERY ghetto and sketchy location. Don't show up / check- in after dark. Like others have mentioned... there are prostitutes that meander the parking lot. We arrived around 7pm and took the last parking space in the open outside lot. The two cars we parked in between had 4 girls smoking weed in one, and two shirtless men that were reclined all the way back in the other.  *Hrmm, somethings not right here*    If you are checking in, just pull up to the valet area and have someone stay in the car there. The check in line was painful as there was only 1 customer rep and there were 4 people ahead of us. We were getting worried since it was taking so long and due to the people/cars we parked next to. I was praying the car wasn't getting broken into while we were waiting in line.   The front and interior area smelled old and similar to bathroom cleaner which was replaced by the overwhelming cigarette smell as we walked further into the casino area.  We parked in the parking garage which was empty - again sketchy - and then proceeded to get lost trying to find the elevators since the front person gave us the wrong directions.   The room was clean and didn't smell like smoke but we booked 1 king and ended up with 2 queens. We didn't fuss about it but just fyi to make sure you check if you need one or the other.  The casino tables are crap. The croupiers are not as helpful as other casinos and didn't seem to care about us having fun. I did like the slots but only for the points and how they earned in comparison to other casinos. I found one that was right in front of a bar so we were able to finally get drinks but expect a long wait if you are not close by.   The kid zone looked odd, kinda like a big Mc Donalds play land. I don't recommend it but there were parents dropping their kids off there and at the movie theater next to it.   The food is the only reason this place gets a 2 star.  Be advised its a LONG wait unless you are going at an odd time, and the it's still a 15 minute wait. The food was great at both the buffet and the cafe. We ordered from the cafe next door and it was AWESOME food for so cheap. We were stuffed!!  And our bill with two drinks (no booze since we brought ours from the casino) was $8.   Oh yea and they charge you fees for internet, newspapers and the pool- which are not negotiable. What ticked us off the most though- we stayed 3 nights and only got 2 newspapers - really? You charge for the newspapers and all and don't even deliver them?!  And the pool is a little dinky pool.  I rather go somewhere else that you get what you pay for. The fee doubled our room rate which we could have paid elsewhere closer to Fremont and the strip.  We will not be going back.

Worst limo service ever!!!!  Unstocked, unfriendly and lying cheapskates. They charged us double the agreed amount even with a receipt showing the correct amount.  If you call them they always send you to voice mail and never return your calls.    They took the long way to Fremont and our hotel (hello - there is a freeway). We had to find the driver at one point who had gone off and didn't tell anyone. He came back to us all standing around the limo wanting to leave. The driver took us to the shadiest liquor store where I thought we were going to get mugged and didn't even drop us at the front of our hotel.

Wow... I'm surprised that this place exists with the great wine bar next door.  I don't know what they are currently doing with their interior but there is NOTHING on the walls and there are white patch marks everywhere. I assume they are going to repaint/redecorate but in the mean time it's awful looking and echos. Not as warm and friendly as I remember from 6 months ago.  Also their outside specials board states they have live music from Thurs- Sat however the waitress informed us it was Fri-Sat... want to change that sign maybe?  The appetizer board we had compromised of 3 meats and one cheese which were all very tasty however there were only 4 very small pieces of cheese vs. the 8 slices of each of the other meats. We waited approximately 30 minutes for our diners which was on the lingering side since there were very few people inside that night. (2-3 other couples total)  The diner was two stars at best. My lavosh was very soggy with no crisp to it. I had to use a fork since the pieces (long rectangular shaped) would not hold any shape.  The chef overlapped all of the pieces atop each other and put a very odd/gross tasting garnish in the center. If they had not laid the pieces atop each other(who does that anyway?), the pieces wouldn't have come out soggy. And the garnish - just get rid of it - don't know why it's there and why it had such an awful taste. I would make the pieces smaller(more manageable) and display them on a plate long-ways laid out completely.   The pasta, no better than that of an olive garden with flakes of red pepper on top. Chicken was dry and it could have used flavor. It was better than the lavosh though.  And the wine... now I did like some of their wines, but they always push the Kokopelli ones and I understand that. It's like going to a micro brewery and asking for a Miller lite. HOWEVER, they serve some great wines that are not made by Kokopelli which I enjoy more. If the waitress was more open to the other non-kokopelli wines I would have probably enjoyed more wine and stayed longer.   All in all for the price we paid, it will be a stroke of drunken luck if we ended up here again.

Every time I've been here it seems they are always out of stock of whatever I need.. except chlorine tablets. This time it was a pool net... com'on - you can't keep your own brand of replacement pools nets in stock? I'm looking at switchin' out our nets now that they never have them in stock.

Romantic cozy Italian restaurant in the heart of old town, a little on the dated side of things. This place reminds me of Bautistia's hole in the wall in Vegas. They  have cioppinio!!! I never have left here hungry or not thoroughly entertained.  Great food, great wine selection and the people watching is awesome on the patio.  I passed by this place so many times... this is a great place to eat, don't need to get all fancy for and has great servers.

Absolutely love this studio!! This studio tops them all.  But before I begin lets clear the (humid) air.   Yes it is hard!  Yes it is silent! Yes it is hot! Yes it is very humid!  Wait, why do I love this without be a sadomasochist? I'll explain a little lower in my review. It's in my option harder than *almost* any other type of workout I've tried. I'm 100% serious when I say that. Whether you go all the way in each pose or just stand/ sit in the room. There is SO MUCH to benefit from doing bikram yoga.  I've been an athlete my entire life (from the time I can remember and per my parents photos even before that - hello jungle gym).  Anyway, to keep it short, I've broken/fractured a few bones in my life... recently and decades ago. All were in not so awesome places like my feet, back, hand...femur. I thought I'd have to quit rock climbing, running and cross fit. Thanks to this studio and bikram yoga all of my pains are gone. My foot pain would wake me up in the middle of the night for years. It stopped after my 2nd week here (about 10 days total practice). After my first class my feet were sore! I never thought that could happen but now I know the muscles were weak and were contributing to the pain.  I even saw two podiatrists who recommended killing the nerve in my foot. I'm glad I tried yoga and didn't go with the Dr's recommendations. I'm blown away as I already had muscle, worked out daily and ate healthy before coming here. I also would get occasional back pains from another injury that I haven't had since I started practicing bikram. I can even do camel pose (knelling backbend) without any pain or discomfort. SO COOL!  I like all of the instructors, but I think my favorite instructor is Audrey. I'm not sure how she does it, but at the exact moment when I close my eyes she'll firmly state "keep your eyes open". In the back of my head I'm thinking 'Was she watching me? No way, I'm not even facing her.' And of course right when I'm getting lightheaded she reminds everyone to breath. Again, another thought in my mind asking if she's watching me or if she's just that good? All of the instructors repeat the same exact movements, how to perform them and then how to go further. I like this approach as it's very methodical, controlled, predictable and allows me time for move without injury.  The yoga room has carpet. Some people say it's gross, I really like it compared to the wood floors. I've managed to accidentally do the splits on wood floors in other yoga studios... super ouchie... totally embarrassing. They allow the new students to sit in the back to watch others and to get some of the cool breeze when someone walks through the exit door.  My first yoga class here was really difficult. I thought I was going to pass out several times so I ended up sitting most of the time. It really amazed me to see how you can get such a workout from something that seems so easy and simple. It took about 4 classes(in a row) for me to be able to keep going and not have to sit down.  The instructors are compassionate about yoga but make sure their student are always ok. I've seen them bring Kleenex, water, and coconut water to people who were definitely in need of these items. Sometimes I think people get overwhelmed by the class because it's different and sometimes can be packed. Anyhoo, I can completely focus on one thing and let everything else go for the 90 minutes while getting an amazing workout. It truly is "me" time. Not to be selfish but I look forward to it everyday and miss it when I can't make it.

Excellent!  One word is really all that is needed to describe this place. It's a family-owned, cozy restaurant with a bar. Even before they expanded it was still family friendly, now it's somewhere I can go with friends for drinks or with my family for breakfast/lunch/dinner. I used to be a regular back when it opened and I can't believe I forgot about this place. It's the right size, not too big as to be loud, not to small as to have too much difficulty getting a table (at most times- watch out HH). Their happy hour is decent, their food is scrumptious and the staff is amazing! We had drinks on Thursday and then came back on Saturday for some biscuits and gravy last week. They are my new favorite place for biscuits and gravy! And a strong contender for spicy bloody Mary's. I love the wood interior. I think that's what gives it the warm and inviting feeling. Totally a neighborhood upscale restaurant. It's now permanently added as one of my go-to places for meeting people. Thanks Mac's for keeping it the same for so many years! Don't change a thing!

I'm never a fan of these brestaurants but this one makes up for it. And yes, I am a chick.   For starts, the girls are wearing uniforms that actually fit them. Nothing is popping out and almost touching my food/beer. Second, the girls are actually clean looking - not sporting the greasy or 'I just got out of bed and look at my nappy hair' look. The service was excellent. Quick, accurate and friendly without.. weird friendly.   Drink prices were fair even off happy hour and the nachos were great.  They actually layer the meat/cheese throughout which is so nice compared to most placed that just dump the flavor on top leaving you with nothing once you peel away the layer of 3 inch thick crap.  The rest of the food looked like regular bar food.   The patio is awesome, they even have a fire place and water/ fish pond thing. Total chill place except for the weird-eye-balley-men here.   We watched a couple walk in and sit across from us at the bar (it's like a square shape). The guy left to use the bathroom or something and this random eye-baller came up and proceeded to not only hit on the chick(who was not as hot as the waitresses) and proceeded to tell her how he was a Dr. and blah blah. Needless to say when the guy returned they almost got in a cat fight.  Sad part about it, Mr. Dr. was wearing holey Old navy t-shirt... That's Snottsdale for ya... $30k millionaires all over the place.

Sad to say this place has tanked.  I used to come here weekly since I live within walking distance.  In the last 6 months,  I have been disappointed to the point where it takes about a month for me to come back and give it a try again. Alas this may have been my last time here.  I went to Iguana Mack's in the morning(11am) on saturday. I sat at the bar(we were the only ones at the bar) and ordered food, appetizers and drinks.  The bloody mary's were awful - they tasted old or if the tomato juice was rotten. We saw a family sit down and attempt to locate a server.  After about 10 maybe 15 minutes they left after no one came to their table.  We waited over 30 minutes for the appetizer.  After we were told the appetizer would be right out when we brought it to the attention of the bartender we waited another 10 minutes before paying for our drinks and leaving.  Excuses don't do anything. 40 minutes without the appetizer and much less our meals is hard to justify.

I've been here several times, last week was the straw though. I bought several items - one being an espresso machine for the boy. I inspected three boxes of the espresso machine which all had been dropped or opened. I asked an associate to see if they were getting any more in, he just said no without looking it up.  I opened the one with the ripped tab which might have been from someone picking the box up, the machine was still wrapped up, styrofoam in place and all so I decided to buy it and return it if there was a problem. I stood in line for over 30 minutes (which I don't mind- I understand my sorry butt didn't think about getting it sooner) however 3 days prior to xmas they only had 2 people running check out and returns. I was about the 10th in line too. *handFace*  Anyhoo, the clerk was very courteous and didn't have any issues with my 20% off coupons so once I was at the stand it was a breeze.   Fast forward to Xmas morning... boy is super happy with the awesome espresso maker and beans from Coffee Rush I purchased.  He opens it up to find that it had clearly been a returned item.... as almost all of the frother, cups, cleaning pieces were missing... empty cardboard box was what we found inside. AND it had been dropped - bottom of the water container was shattered. I just about cursed because as a store - getting a returned item from a customer... and a $300 item as well.. Don't you think to check it first before putting it back on the shelf??   Fast forward 2 days post-xmas... go into the BBB store with the espresso machine which is heavy, I waited in line but what I observed was pretty stupid. The one associate who was doing returns was definitely over-run with a line of 5+ people, the manager next to her was just looking around... completely void of the line of customers or that the associate had asked him for help. Once he did get the hint a few minutes later after walking across the returns area several times, he tried to help a customer but they turned around and asked the other associate what to do.  Not very impressed by the managers lack of knowledge and inability to help customers. You are a manager- know how to complete a return.   Oh yea and the process to get a new espresso machine... since there weren't any in stock, I waited to return the purchase one, returned it, was then sent back to the kitchen area where another associate ordered another one, who then sent me back to the front to wait in line again to get my refund amount (since we chose a different model with a refund of $10). They couldn't have done that at one station with one associate so I didn't have to wait in line twice for the same transaction and use up 3 different associates time??    Ugh... if not for those 20% of coupons I would buy everything online.

This is a nice clean place. I always look for places I can take both family and friends and this once fits the bill. Surprisingly the pizza is really good! Not spinatos or grimaldi's quality but best of the bar food I've had. Thin crust and they have ground hamburger as a topping, yummy! They also have a lot of games, pools tables, shuffle board and TONS of tvs.  Besides the pizza, I'm a fan of the focaccias. Good place to come during a weekend for sports games.

I hate and love this place. I always go for one thing (usually treats for the dogs) but end up buying 4 or 5 other things.  Ground beef with bacon for burgers, jalapeno cheese brats, bacon wraped filets... so many choices... AND I'm trying to go vegetarian.  Not helping me out here are you Von Hanson's??    Oh and their coupons are awesome - buy one get one on a lot of stuff. OH yea and the stuffed chicken breast(with stuffing)... we pick up extra stuffing just for the holidays since it's always a hit. If you need something specially cut they will also cut it anyway you want. We get leg bones for the dogs and have them cut in thick rounds so they have hours of enjoyment.

I am always amazed by this place. From the outside it looks like the size of a Walgreens or corner store. Its never crowded like supermarkets and has a pretty big selection for it's size. I went to Frys looking for ground white pepper and ended up going to AJ's, Whole foods and never finding it. I walked into F&E to pick up some organic veggies and checked to see if they had it.. Yup - and it was SO MUCH cheaper than the whole pepper corns I picked up a whole foods.   Everything is fresh and comparable to other supermarkets (for organics) in their pricing. I buy mostly organic so it's nice to have F&E which has the selection I'm looking for. Their breads are fresh and the meats selections are AWESOME. They are a little pricier but for organic meat but I'm willing to pay the extra.  Nice atmosphere and very relaxed. The staff are always friendly and very helpful.    Oh and the coupons in paper make a big difference $5 and $10 off $25 or $50.

*This review is for their boarding/ kennel service only.*   I am so picky, my dog is my best friend(don't tell the bf!).  After searching for a kennel for almost 3 months before a week long vacation(first one in 3 years) my bf and I found UAH for our two large pit bulls. We had difficulty finding a kennel that would take our dogs since they are pit bulls and had spacious enough kennels that both could be in the same one. One place was going to charge extra because of their breed and we would have had to pay extra for two kennels and two extra play times for each dogs, geeez $$$$.  This was the only reasonably priced, well staffed, clean, and highly managed kennel we found period.  All of the staff have always been happy, friendly and honest each time we go there. They have indoor and indoor/outdoor kennels which is nice for summer/winter. They allow two dogs in one kennel and will separate them if needed.  The kennels are nicely sized and the dogs can not see the dogs next to them(some of the others had glass walls separating them- my dog would go crazy seeing another dog next to him that he couldn't play with). They have happy hour(kong with peanut butter), TLC (extra play time) and free baths for your dogs if they are there longer than 4 days I believe. They also take them out three times a day which is more than some of the others we looked at.  We have taken our dogs there three or four times now and never have had a problem. The dogs always come home happy AND healthy. It's nice also to know they are at a hospital so if something should ever happen, or as our dogs get older and need medication, this place can handle it all and we don't have to switch to somewhere else.  They give you a report card for the "campers" on how they did while you were away which is cute.  I really can't say enough, but we have had a great experience and will keep bringing our dogs here for our boarding needs.

We actually had a great time here. They were out of the fried alligator which was a bummer but we have some great dishes. We sat in the bar area which was the best place - LARGE fish tank(think rain forest cafe) to look at . Service was good - we had two or three different people stop by to see if we were ok which was great. I was surprised honestly since this place always was passed up. It's a game/fish restaurant - try at least once since they have some odd - and interesting foods.

FYI - it's called Hon Machi, not Han Machi.  I'm surprised by the two other reviews-  portions are small?? Same size as Kona, RA, Sakana, sushi eye, etc.  It is always full from 5-7 for happy hour. The lunch special is $8.95 for two rolls and I get them to go all the time. The owner, Jackie, is awesome and always friendly and helps out when it gets busy for the other servers. The sushi  is fresh and delicious. I really like mom-and-pop places like this. It's nothing fancy but in the three years I've been going here it's always been great and never a disappointment.  My favorites are the Las Vegas roll and Hon Machi roll(both are on the happy hour special).

I'll start by saying I haven't eaten here yet, but I have picked up some of their green juice drinks which have always been awesome! Love their Field of Greens drink - not bitter, not sweet, Just riiiight! I always forget about this place except when I'm thinking of where I can get an awesome juice drink. I saw someone order their tofuizo (tofu chirizo) and I was going to order one had I not had a bizillion things to do today.  I'm coming back and I hope they have the tofuizo next time I'm there(getting hungry thinking about it now)

I must be picky or just notice a lot of things.... lets list out the cons, then pros. This all occurred on a Saturday around 1pm.  Cons: 1) When asking the hostess if there are any spaces at the bar(which there appeared to be) she states "no, there's someone in the bathroom" and instead of asking the person who had his arm around two chairs(big dude), she made up a lie. No one sat in those seats and they were subsequently taken by new people 2 minutes afterward when they just walked up and sat down. Useless hostess.  2) The hostess brought water glasses over to the table on a serving tray and then sneezed in her hand(right hand) and proceeded to pick up our water glasses and place them on the table with the same hand. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?  3) It took 15 minutes to get a beer which was ordered after 5 minutes.(20 minutes to get a drink besides water)  4) There were people sitting every other seat seat at the bar, with their legs/arms around other chairs. The bartender or manager needs to come by and make sure the chairs are open for potential guest by putting them sideways or in a fashion that makes them available for use and not for random body parts to be held up by. None of these person appeared to be holding spaces for other individuals... just their feet.  5) Very loud people who were clearly drunk making the atmosphere difficult to hear or have a conversation with.  6) With so many tvs, they only had three things on: their dumb music videos, news, and some reality tv show. No sports(except on the news when it was re-capping).    Pros: 1) Waitress acknowledged that they were busy and stated they were understaffed.(On a Saturday). She apologized for the issue with our waters and got us fresh glasses. Although she corrected the previous hostesses mistakes, she kept pushing asking us why we wanted our check... Don't keep asking me when we've already said we don't want to stay for "X" reasons. I shouldn't need to give a reason to get my check.   I doubt we will be back here. Totally uninviting atmosphere, noisy, non-sports oriented. I thought this was a sports bar... guess it's just another wannabe scottsdale bar that just doesn't come 1/3 as close to it's expectations. Poor services, disgusting hostess practices, long wait times(even when it wasn't full).... not for me.

I could eat here everyday. The variety of different pastys are awesome!  Chicken tiki masala is definitely #1. The music gets a little weird but the atmosphere and awesome and the beer selection rocks. Not only that but they do have some of their pasty's in vegetarian form - so when you aren't feelin' meat you still get an freakin' awesome tasting pasty.

Hrmm...  Can I have some lube with this expensive purchase? Not a chance!  Seriously - if you can buy your toy elsewhere, DO IT. This place is like most car dealerships - "lets work with your monthly payment". Me: "No lets not!" When you purchase a vehicle, you negotiate the trade-in separate from the vehicle you are purchasing. Don't negotiate the two together, that's how they screw you.  And by screw, I mean they gouge you in every way that you don't think to look for. They tried to add in fees which they then removed after I pointed them out. Sales people are all kids who really don't much anything and are all commission based.  They will tell you that they will work with you but they don't have any negotiating power at all. The gray-haired old guys in the fish bowls are the only ones that give prices so skip the kids and snag them if you are already set to purchase.  I can't blame them for offering it but their "financing" options but they don't disclose all the facts which are VERY important. They just tell you " you are approved" and give you options of low intro percentages.  They tell you that the percentage goes up after so many years but this part they only tell you once unless you keep asking - that and they confuse their own financing, so be careful. Listen kids, they give you a credit card, not a loan. The credit card has amortized interest(you are paying the interest first before the principal payment) and is worse off than getting a traditional motorcycle loan at a slightly higher percentage. Go to your own back and don't use their financing, you'll get mail fliers from all the different companies afterward for who they ran your credit through.   Their service prices are actually MORE than that listed on the manufacturers websites. And more meaning $200+ per service. We actually spoke to a manufacturer representative and advised them of this practice as it is not just the labor price difference.   I would avoid this place and if we were able to find a bike somewhere else we would ahve bought it there.

I've never been disappointed here and it's always a fun place to hang out. The food(tacos) are awesome. My favorite is the street style chicken tacos. The breakfast burrito is also awesome and BIG.   $2.50 coronas until 7 are the right price too. When the weather is a tad cooler it's fantastic to sit at the bar and soak up the sun.  The bar tenders are always on top of the drinks and even give a little entertainment. Granted I have been there primarily before 5-6pm.  Oh and the giant games they have are hilarious to play with after a few shots ;)

Oh Stadium Club... I missed you. This is probably the only dive-bar I will go to. It's clean, the people are decent and the servers are usually on top of things. Trivia night can get pretty wild but the rest of the time its usually really laid back. FYI- Sunday it's a packers bar.  Oh and they have powerball and scratchers too :)

I know this place is changing owners next week but I have to write a review of this place. Where do I start?   On a positive note the wait staff are very friendly, quick and don't leave alone too long. I like that they were very open and positive about the bar- this is the two star rating.   Now the bad.  I tried all of their micro brews and they were all disgusting. Note to the new owner- please please clean up the brews.   I couldn't finish any of them.  They do not taste clean/ refreshing and have the smell of sanitizer and muck. I realize that some are made in Bisbee and others in the bar but there wasn't one that I wanted to re-order.  Beer was also served luke warm.  The wings were the lowest quality of meat- very fatty  only 1  drumstick. That and they give you 10 wings. The sauce was dumped on and not tossed.  The flavor was gritty and very bland/store bought.  This place reminds me of a dive 80s bar that is not anywhere near its potential. It's next to the ASU stadium yet the majority of the clientele are over the age of 40 and kinda rough looking.  Better food, better beer are a must.

Didn't know this place was an Iowa bar hangout until recently when we popped in on a Saturday Morning. The game had just started and we got the last table outside(there was nothing open, even a bar stool on the inside). I haven't been here at night but at least during the day it's pretty chill.   They play the game when it's on and not music like other places. The food was actually pretty good. The portions were large which were expected. We tried the bbq ribs which were really good and I had mahi tacos. The boy had carne tacos which were also really good but the bbq ribs were the best.  Overall the service was great - drinks were never empty and the outside bar loaded with TVs was impressive. It's a high contender against out other fav's for weekend football for sure. Definitely a younger crowd but they're old enough to not be d*bags.

Ugh, where to start... I've been going here since before it changed from the waterfront to Nate's. I only go if I'm already in the complex at Luna or Pita Jungle.  When it first opened it was actually a great bar. Now... I'll just break it down like this:  Cons - Off track betting = Shady guys drinking cokes eye balling the very few women in the bar. - There is always a broken toilet AND sink in the women's restroom - I hear there are often broken pissers/ sinks in the men's room as well - There is only one good bar tender  - The crowd has definitely started getting super shady- sliding back to the waterfront crowd...  - They have a lobster tank - with sick/ dead lobsters in it - Gross tap lines - been sick here a few times - stick to bottled beer - The decor is old/ ripped posters - needs help - the patio is empty - why not make it inviting - it's not like you have this awesome lake view or anything...  Pros - Boston is the best bartender in town! - They finally put 1 TV on the patio. It's too small to see though unless you sit right in front if it. - The lake outback is beautiful - however you can also see it from many other places - Lots of TVs inside - just don't mind being watched like a TV yourself if you're a girl... - Ok selection of beers  - Great place to go watch football but just know half the TVs will be on horse races

AWFUL!!  I'll put up  a picture I took yesterday.... one photo says a thousand words.... creepy old guys drinking water/soda totally and obviously eyeballing each woman in the bar. I couldn't even stay for a drink because they were creeping me out. One guy walked up to me and looked straight down my shirt, burped and walked off. WTF? I never write about crude stuff(mostly because there are very few situations like this) but I couldn't believe how violated I felt. I immediately placed a bet on my horse for the Belmont stakes and promptly walked to Valle luna.

I'm a big fan. I was here last Saturday and had the best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time. I always forget about this place since it's kind of out of the way and not part of a large corner or strip mall area.  It's a nice, well put together sports bar that is clean, and not over the top.  The bartender (I think it was Kesha) and servers have always been friendly and on top of things. The fried pickles are super yummy and the salads are HUGE.  Our food has always come out timely without any issues.  Decor matches which is always nice since most places are hodgepodged together.  I haven't found anything wrong with this place really. Turkey cheese steak is awesome and so is the Pit Boss.  I recommend it as a nice neighborhood sports bar.

I'm not sure what the hype is about this place... happy hour is all we go here for.    Probably been here a dozen times now. I'd call it an upscale dive bar.  Since it's close by and usually not busy we end up meeting people here. It's kinda hidden over by the oreck store behind the B of A on the street corner.  It's a small bar inside and about the same size outside. I think it opens at 4pm and doesn't do lunch.  The food is ok bar food. Honestly the cheeze wiz on the pizza is gross but drunk people seem to love it. Bar top is always dirty which is gross and it gets hot and humid inside a lot.  Patio area is probably the nicest place with the misters. Oh and they have free popcorn. There gigantic pitcher mixed drinks only have 1 shot which is misleading since they are the size of a pitcher. The shot-ski thing is kinda cool since someone always misses/spills. I wish they had a Polaroid/dig camera or something for shots of those.  Overall it's good for the HH but not much else.

I've gone to so many other car wash places but I always come back here. The wash it's self is pretty good. They go over it was hand mitts and then through the wash. The guys at the end though who do the drying/detailing really make the difference. I always tip the detail guy since they make the cars shine. I'm a big fan since they vacuum, spray the windows/mirrors/glass and detail the wheels nicely. They have coupons on their website and are in mailings as well as those coupon big books some schools/stores sell. Also they have a punch card type system where after I believe 10 washes you get one free.    It is NOT QUICK so don't come in thinking you will get your car back in 5 minutes, all sparkly clean. It takes time for them to do it right. I've seen them work almost 25 minutes on the detailing part before so depending on how dirty your car is how long it might take. If you want a quick wash n' go you might want to take your car somewhere else.

I only tried this place because my regular place was booked for several hours and me being impatient wanted a pedicure NOW. They fit me right in with about 15 minutes notice. First impression - much like other nail salons but clean, all of the tools were sterile in packets and the tubs were being scrubbed when I walked in. The young man who did my pedicure was very detail oriented and gave a pretty darn good massage. He even complimented me on how I kept my feet pretty. FYI they do prefer cash for the tip. For the price their top of the line pedicure was on $42 and that was with the scrub/ hot stone massage/callus removal and oil/lotion rub.

WORST WINGS EVER!! How can they be so disgusting?? I got sick after trying to eat two wings. And by try, I mean I took the skin off to allow all the grease to drain, yes DRAIN, from under the skin before taking a bite. They were slimy, oily, and un-flavorful even with spicy garlic sauce.  After pointing this out to the waitress, she informed us that they no longer had a grill...and everything is fried. Period. You have a restaurant.... your main food is chicken wings and you don't have a grill? Disgusting disgusting disgusting. After an hour my stomach was upset and I felt like I was going to heave. Not going back there, not sure what I was thinking since there is a brewery right next door.  :-/

For such a small "boutique" type store, they actually have a lot to offer. Their accessories and selection of ques, stands and wall art are all packed right in without feeling cramped. They sell Olhausen pools tables here.   Due to the limited space, the day we were in, they only have two in the show room but they allowed us to build our own custom table on their computer. We were very impressed by Richard's good advise on the tables, options and prices they came in. He pretty much showed us everything good/bad about all the different types of rails, skirts and stains for each of the designs we picked. He even showed us the swatches of felt that we choose to see how they looked on a table. The severices and follow-up they sell with the tables appear to be extrodiary compared with other pool table/ billard stores.   I reccomend them for their customer service. we didn't buy a table from them, but we are stillin the market so if we do I'll update my review.

We found this place on looterang and decided to give it a try. We were surprised by the size of the place. There's an inside bar and an outside bar. There are tons of tvs inside and two outside at the outside bar. The outside bar was perfect for the beautiful weather. The bar tender(Doug) was very helpful, went over his favorites/recommendations and the selection of beers. Beer prices were good - not over priced like a lot of places with a good selection draft beers.  I had the carne tacos and thought they were great. The meat was not dry like most places carne tacos and the cabbage was just right. We also had buffalo sliders which were pretty good for bar food. The only thing I was not interested in was the Spanish rice that came with the tacos. They tasted fine but the texture was that of instant/ microwaved rice-ick.  Besides that I could day drink here any day... if I didn't have to work.

I used to go to the Spinato's in Tempe and am SOOO glad there is one closer to me now.  I LOVE how they re-did the old Chilis interior with white tiles and brick on the ceiling. Very italian looking and cozy feeling.  They have a fantastic selection of food and the best pizza I have ever had. I'm pretty sure they add crack to their pizza sauce since it is highly addictive and sweet. We have sat in both the bar and restaurant and had the same courteous and quick wait staff attention in both areas.  My favorite item is the appetizer spaghetti baked calzone with ricotta and meatballs.  This is just big enough you can eat it as a meal yourself.  The salads are large in size and the dressings taste fresh. My favorite pizza is hard to say but the "Get Meaty" and "Spicy Italian" are both heaven in a thin crust. Check please and a wheel barrow! Oh and they have a nice selection of beers on tap.  I'm such a fan, I'm probably here at least once every other week.

We've taken our bikes here(all 4 of them) for something or another over the past year. They have always been very knowledgeable regarding their services/parts and options for repairs.  I had them tune up and fix an old 70's Murray that had been hanging in my parents garage for the last 15 years.  They were awesome and very detailed. They even ordered the white walls that were on the bike originally.  From minor tire repairs, tune ups and complete make-overs, they do a fantastic job.  They call when the bikes are done and even repaired a tire while I waited in the store(5mins).  Definitely nice to have a professional shop I can trust with my bikes.  Oh and their bike classes are also a big plus. I haven't been in a while but their beginner mountain biking classes on Tuesdays were a BLAST!  Kale is not only a great repairman but also a man mountain biker, even on a single speed.

There is no way I can go back to one of those cost cutter/great clips places after coming to Saskia. After the first color/ cut I saw my hair for more than hair. She works with your style and helps you get creative with your hair. Red is not an easy color and since I've been going here I get non-stop complements on my color and style. I would highly recommend

HA HA, what a hoot!! I went to the one in tempe which was a dump and this was is much nicer!  That one was a 2+ this one is a 4+. They have an awesome 3rd floor bar/patio and even 2nd floor view is awesome. I wish they were closer since I'd go here like I do DOS. The 50 cent beers are Pabst... puke!! The service was decent, I sat at the bar so they kept up with me.   The place was clean, didn't have any funky smells like the tempe location did.  We had some munchies which were decent, fried calamari and crawfish. Didn't get sick and were pretty tasty. Still would place them at bar food level so don't come here just for those.    The beer prices were on par with other bars. The stripper pole was entertaining just like the stairs! I don't know which one was better, the 40 some year olds who were playing with the pole and Capt'n or the drunk people trying to figure out how to walk up the stairs. The majority of the crowd was downstairs least to say.  I don't believe they have an elevator but man, I'll take the three flights drunk for the views that place has.

Meh... I've had better at a few places. I truly miss my gelato place so I've been looking for an alternative for a while. I've gone here several times and always leave somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong though, the staff is always tiding the place, making the toppings in order, checking on the spoon supplies and such. It's relatively clean inside, and unusually bright. There is always 1 or 2 of the yogurt machines which drips goo out before the yogurt which is just gross. Makes me think the machine valve has a leak and is letting the yogurt get too warm. The flavors are not consistent and several taste "chemically". I mean, cheesecake frozen yogurt is probably difficult to get right but it's really weird here. The chocolate is good and the red velvet is good. The coconut is gross... that one especially. I'm going to continue my search for something better though. They do have text message promos where the weight per ounce is cheaper some weeks. So if you like this place sign up for them. I don't play with the ipads and such, people + yogurt + kids = gross fingers. Come to think of it, I've never seen the staff wipe those down...

I have to give props to the Orchard in Chandler. My laptop was dropped, screen side down, onto my tile floor causing the entire display glass to shatter. I took the computer to Apple at the Mall and was advised the only repair they could do was to replace the entire upper display unit including the metal case to the tune of $450.  The rep at Apple suggested I look around for another place that would be able to replace the glass only. They wrote down a few places they recommended including the Orchard. I hadn't given much thought to the Orchard initially and decided to try to replace the glass myself. Many curse words/broken glass/hair dryer/tweezers later I came to my senses and took the computer to a professional. I did a quick search online and found this location right around the corner.  The tech at this location greeted me promptly and advised he would be with me in a few moments as he was swapping out a hard drive out. Meanwhile I checked out the computers they had for sale and waited a total of 5 minutes.  I brought the computer up when it was my turn and was happy to hear the LCD was not damaged by my attempted repair.  The tech reassured me they would still be able to replace the glass and had seen much worse. Only downside was that they had to send it to their Mesa store for the repair. Total cost just under $100 since I already had the glass screen. Much easier to stomach than the first figure. I also dropped the computer off on Sunday afternoon and it was back on Tuesday. I checked through my files and made sure everything and the new screen worked/looked just like the old one. I was very happy with their level of professionalism and speedy repair.

***** Drove by on 1/4/2013 and now the place is called "Spur Saloon" - Looks like the same -owners. It's been 3 different bars in about 3 years now.

We drove by and saw this new sushi place and thought to try it tonight.  First thing I thought when I walked in - where's the decor? It's very sterile and cafeteria looking inside.  Kinda similar to a yogi's grill but with more seating. There is no patio however there is space for one which I thought was odd since it could be used for outside seating.  It's a cheap sushi place but the cheap price has to do with their rolls only being 2-3 pieces and not the usual 6-8. Portion control maybe? It gives you the option of ordering several different rolls(of 2 pieces or 3 pieces).  If you calculate the # of rolls you have to order to get the same number of pieces for a real sized roll it's just slightly cheaper than other sushi restaurants.  I was not impressed and honestly will probably never go back. I'll be surprised if this place is around in 6 months. I would like to see a better atmosphere as it feels almost fast foodish.

I didn't know what to expect since some of the reviews are... odd and difficult to understand. I really don't know what they are talking about. I went here last week for the lunch buffet. From what my co-workers have told me, Friday is usually the best day to go since they have the best dishes then. I've only been on a Friday but that's what I've heard. We got there right when they opened and there were several other tables already seated when we arrived.   The food is served at a smaller buffet table. About 10-15 dishes with 5 or so desserts. We also ordered Dosa (LOVE DOSA) with the potatoes and naan to dip in our curry dishes. I had two types of rice, one with curry and one without that were very flavorful. And the curry cheese squares- I think they are Paneer - AMAZING!! The Tandoori chicken was excellent. They have really amazing food, and I'm a picky person!  There were several other dishes I tried which were very good. I did not have one item which I thought was bad and pretty much cleaned my plate. Oh, and the desserts... I could have eaten them as a meal! I can't believe how delicious the Gulab jamun was. It was like eating a donut hole covered in honey goodness. I'm sure it's similar but WOW. DEE-Licious!  The wait staff were excellent too. Prompt, helpful and polite. I think they were on the borderline of being too helpful. BUT my glass of water was never empty and my co-workers ice tea was the same. I can safely say I will be back again  :-)

Tangible used to be PB. They haven't changed anything except the paint and they added a red light booth. The people who work there are missing a few elements of customer service. Been in a few times now since the switch and they are always rude, and act like I'm bothering them. They didn't explain the "buy out" well for us with contracts with PB either. They bought all the contracts from PB and won't switch them  to another location. That and the price increased!    You call with a question or a billing problem and they can't help you and say that their billing is always right.  It's expensive(+$50), the staff are all rude, and half the time there are no towels in the rooms and the beds have lotion from someone else which has not been wiped off. Hi herpes... SO GROSS. They don't wipe off the edge of the beds where everyone grabs to get out!  Thank goodness summer is here and I can get some rays outside. I only go here in the winter so I'm not so translucent and vampire looking. I'll be looking for a new location this fall/winter.

They have painted the interior since I was in last making it look nicer but there are no new beds. I was going to try them out again(I know - why go back, I should know better) but the only stand up booth had a line and there was lotion all of the front door handle(inside and out) and the floor looked to also have lotion on it!    Not sure how long the lotion was there for but either way it's gross and dangerous. The boy used to go here but cancelled his membership and he was told that he had to come back when a manager was there. Thankfully he asked for the form that he would have to come back and sign and got that taken care of. The receptionist advised the manager would call him to confirm the cancellation and the date being effective and never heard back. They cancelled it but didn't bother to do what they said they would.   He also had been going there for years and had one of their super cheap rates from the days of PB. They didn't care at all about him cancelling but when I tried to cancel they tried everything to get me to stay... probably because I was a sucker and was paying twice as much. Done and Done.  No customer care, not clean(still) and bad business conduct.
