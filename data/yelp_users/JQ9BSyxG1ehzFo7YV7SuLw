I love urban cookies! They have the best cupcakes, cookies and brownies. Love that they have happy hour on Sunday afternoon and Monday's too. My all time favorite would be their chocolate cupcake and the double chocolate with sea salt cookie. To die for!  If I lived closer I would probably be there everyday! Their staff has always been nice and one time I came in on my birthday last year and got me some cupcakes and got one of their birthday cupcake and the nice lady asked if it was my birthday. I said yes and she said the birthday cupcake was on her. So sweet!

I definitely DO NOT recommend going to Dr Racette for acne. I found him by going to zocdoc and all the reviews there stated that he's amazing. So I thought I would give it a try. Only to find out those reviews are no where close to true. First time I called the office to schedule an appointment, I specifically scheduled to see Dr. Racette, but I got the nurse practitioner.  Second time around I still specifically scheduled for him and got him that time. That was my first time meeting him. He was decent at that time. 3rd visit I still scheduled to see him but I got another nurse practitioner, who prescribed me more meds with the topical creams that the first practitioner had prescribed me. I was not happy at the 3rd visit. Being new to the office, I would want to see the same person so that I could build a relationship with my doctor. So 4th appointment came along, I told the medical assistant that I want to see Dr Racette and she stated she will put on the door that only Dr Racette will come in. He came in with a student. He said hi. I told him my concern with my acne as I had some present at the visit. And it went downhill from there. He was very condescending and was NOT helpful at all. Instead of making me feel at ease. He made me feel like he did not care. The medication that I am taking is an antibiotic and taking it long term is not good. When I asked what is long term. He gave me a smart ass answer saying that every doctor has their own definition of what long term is. I obviously wanted to know his definition of long term because he's supposed to be my doctor. And he said 3months max. I stated I've been taking my meds for 4months. And he said well I wouldn't take it anymore but it's up to me.  What kind of doctor tells you it's bad but does not warn you of what long term is before reaching the long term time frame? He does not care about your well being. So if you want somebody that will listen to your concerns and not talk down to you, do yourself a favor and do not go to him. He will just make you feel little and you will go out of his office with more questions and doubts when he's supposed to help you make your situation better.

Loved their Thai tea! So delish! Food was awesome and the owner was super nice. Had the chicken with panang curry sauce and the coconut soup.  Also had their mango sticky rice for dessert. So yum!
