Great sports bar!  Beer on tap selection is meh.. but I've learned to not expect much from sports bars.  The wing secret sauce is a MUST-HAVE. It's the perfect amount of spicy and sweet.  Here's what we ordered and how it was:  Rojo Diablo - it's fried chicken breast dipped in the special wing sauce and mozzarella is added. The flavors were all there! The bread is mildly sweet which was a nice touch. The chicken was a bit a dry but I ordered wing sauce on the side which helped.  Sweet potato fries - If you like sweet potato fries, these will do the job. Nothing to crazy, just your average sweet potato fries.  Gorilla Wings in Mild - think Native Newyorker Wings. This is the quality. It does the job and is much better than the Hooters down the street  Gorilla Wings in Secret Sauce - DO IT.  Fries - If you're not a shoestring fries fan, then don't get them! They are just your basic shoestring fries.  Fish Tacos - I didn't try them but was told they did a great job.  Potato Skins - Good!  Cheese Fries - They're basically fries with cheese melted on top.  Sooo yeah. They're good though! At least it's not processed cheese.   It's bar food. So expect bar food quality. It's a great place to watch the game. Some of the loudest most active fans come to this location so be forewarned.  The customer service was great! They messed up our order twice but we got a free beer and free order of fries so, no complaints here. Plus they were super busy so no hard feelings.

We ordered take-out from here. I always have great things to say about their customer service. They are the nicest, most accommodating people, but I don't have such great things to say about their food. Here are the things I've had from there in the past month and how I feel:  Chicken Parm - Don't do it. You're better off making it at home. The sauce is bland and the chicken is dry.  Margherita Pizza - It's doesn't taste bad! It definitely doesn't taste like a margherita pizza though.   Wings - Their honey hot sauce is a favorite among my friends. I enjoy their suicide sauce. It's called "suicide" sauce for a reason, so if you're not a spicy food eater, don't do it. Order boneless because their bone-in wings are soggy.  Garlic cheese bread - Again, you can literally through cheese and garlic on toast and make this at home.   Overall, their pizza does its job! I guess I don't really discriminate when it comes to pizzas. All sizes, toppings and types work for me.

Don't get the BLT. If you want a BLT in the area, go to Cut Above Cafe down the street. This place is over priced for the quality of food you get.   You should be able to get a decent sandwich at a deli. This place honestly shouldn't even call themselves a deli.

Today was my first time here and unfortunately I don't have great things to say about this place.   I ordered the Barrier Trio which came with coconut shrimp, ahi tuna steak, and a crab avocado stack. I can't really say much about the taste of these items because there was a hair in my food so I had them bring me something else. I understand that these kinds of things happen so the two star review isn't because of the hair in the food but is because of what happened afterwards or what didn't happen afterwards. I ordered the fish tacos and a French Onion soup in place of my last meal.  The fish tacos were dry. And the French onion soup came with a slice of provolone baked on top. Neither were appetizing but it could be because the hair incident earlier turned me off from eating in altogether.   The Blooming Onion tasted a bit bland and the sauce it came with tasted like watered down ranch.   The only saving grace about this place is that the people were extremely nice. Our waiter went above and beyond to accommodate. Two managers came and apologized for the incident, but get this, nothing was comped, not even the soup or the appetizer.   I'm not looking for a handout, but usually in cases like these, when extra has been spent, the management team steps up and will comp an appetizer or present a coupon for next time. That didn't happen here.

Cool vibe. Urban feel. Delicious drinks. Coffee is always on point. Just a tip to Americano drinkers, they charger their Americanos the same price for whatever size so get the large!   One of my favorite study spots.  Had their jalapeno and bacon mac and cheese the other night. It was served in a massive mug, and it was delicious!

Hands down my favorite pizza spot in Arizona. The margherita pizza is phenomenal. The whole basil leaves are a nice touch. I use to work right next door so we ordered from here frequently. Here are some items I suggest:  -Meatballs -Margherita Pizza (any pizza really) -Tuna Melt  The ambiance is pretty neat at night. It's homey and cozy. One of my co-workers actually proposed to his wife here!   Haven't had a chance to try the drinks yet but I hear they do a good job!

Decent spot for Chinese delivery. Our delivery options downtown are limited and believe it or not, pizza every day does get tiring. Delivery is usually pretty fast and the food is better than most chinese take out in the area, especially for the price.  Here's what I've had Orange chicken - pretty good. I ask them to make it spicy Sundevil pork- meh Lettuce Wraps - worth it and cheap Hot and Sour soup - standard Pepper Beef - pretty good, sauce is flavorful Tofu lo mein - I ask for it spicy and it's delicious! Crab puffs - standard Eggroll - standard

I'm sure I was a mermaid in my past life because if I could live solely off seafood, I would never miss meat ever again.  This place I hold dear to my heart. My boyfriend took me here on our first date and maybe that has something to do with this fabulous review I'm about to write but bias aside, the food here is the best seafood you will get in Arizona. PERIOD.  I ordered the scallops and my boyfriend ordered the swordfish. The sauce the scallops come in is the best sauce I've had on any seafood. It's not light and citrusy so if that's what you're going for, don't order it. It's more cheesy, rich and filling.  The swordfish was also delicious. It came without any dressing or vegetables or anything but it didn't need it! The fish speaks for itself.  Also, if you're willing to splurge a little more, get some sides! The mushrooms, the potatoes and the asparagus are worth it. Take home the leftovers.  MAKE A RESERVATION AHEAD OF TIME. THIS PLACE IS ALWAYS PACKED.   I haven't tried dessert here, but if it's anything like the desserts at Maestro's Steakhouse, it's worth every penny.

Went here again Sunday night with my boyfriend and as always, it was delicious.  I decided to leave an updated review because we order a seafood tower this time. We ordered Pacific Coast oysters on half shell, seared ahi tuna, jumbo tiger shrimp, the swordfish and scallops. The fish was cooked perfectly; it pretty much melts in your mouth. The sauce the scallop entree is cooked in is delicious. Oysters were good. Shrimp was HUGE. And the sauce the seared tuna came in was to-die-for.   All the above was phenomenal. We racked up a pretty high tab including wine and whiskey but every penny was worth it.  Again, I didn't get to the dessert because I was stuffed but one day I will!

Never been a fan of Starbucks coffee but their Americanos take me where I need to go.  Love their pastries and breakfast sandwiches though. I always get a spinach or tomato square with my Americano. It's the perfect on-the-go food.  Service here was great also.

Affordable, authentic and large portions! Perfect place for take-out. It seems to always be a full house here.  Menu is a little overwhelming but there are pictures of entrees all around the restaurant for reference.

Gyro here beats Pita Jungle, which doesn't say too much but if you're a gyro fan, you will enjoy the gyros here.  French fries are fried perfectly. Crisp on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside.  Chicken wings were a bit dry but I loved the sauce it came in. I ordered 'hot'.  Philly Cheesesteak bread melts in your mouth. I'm not a philly cheesesteak aficionado per say but this one is worth a shot.  $5.99 on Sundays and Mondays will get you a Philly Cheesesteak, side of fries, 4 wings and a drink.

Definitely not authentic but if you're looking for authenticity, any chain restaurant isn't the way to go.  Here's what I recommend getting: -Dynamite Chicken -Lettuce Wraps -Pad Thai (get tofu!)  Don't get: -their sushi -their Kung pao chicken  The flavors at Pei Wei are always good!

Could spend hours here.   It's almost worse than me being in a shoe store.  Nothing bad to say. One suggestion though, if there is a way to get your winter and seasonal beers out sooner, that'd be great! I've been waiting forever for Brown Shugga!

Been here twice now and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience every time. I've only gone for breakfast.  Staff is always nice and accommodating.  Here's what I've had and how I feel:  Biscuits & Gravy: Delicious. Hashbrown Casserole: Also delicious. Fried Apples: Taste like your typical fried apples, which means it's delicious. Country Fried Steak: Cooked well, crispy, and the added gravy makes the dish Country Fried Chicken: Just as good as the country fried steak Eggs: I mean, eggs are eggs. Just order them how you like.  Steak: Cooked well. I'm picky with my steak so the fact that we paid the cheap price for this steak and I enjoyed it, means something.  Apple cider in a Frozen mug: Get this EVERYTIME. Breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's refreshing and works great with any meal.   Disclaimer: I may have been hungover or beyond ravenous upon my visits here, so this review may be a bit exaggerated.  All in all, it's a great, decently priced breakfast spot.

I've been here a couple times and never thought to leave a review because it really is just your basic Starbucks. I love the ambience and location of this one though. It is convenient and the brick walls give off an urban feel.  Here is why this location receives one star: A couple weeks ago, I was getting off work. I worked 10 hours on set that day, directing a video shoot. Like most of my days, it doesn't end right after work so I stopped at this location for my usual iced Americano.  This is my order "A grande iced Americano with no room". This may seem like i'm being petty but the barista gave me an American which was, I kid you not, 3/4 full. No room means, literally no room because I don't add anything to it. And I understand, that maybe she heard "extra room" instead of "no room" so politely I let her know that I asked for no room. She goes, "do you want more ice?" WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THIS. Of course I do not want more ice, the point of "no room" is for "more coffee". So I said, 'No I'd like more coffee please'. And she rudely grabs my cup, huffs at me and adds a fuck ton of ice . A FUCK TON. So much so that the lid does not close on my drink, which means my straw also does not fit in my drink. She slides this insult of a drink towards me and walks away.   Since I was already tired that day, and irritated with this barista's horrible customer service, I grabbed the drink took it outside and dumped out the ice.  I'm not usually one for negative reviews but I'm a firm believer in good customer service and this location did not offer it.  Just thought I'd give future customers a heads up.

This past Saturday was my second time here and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it.   We did the Valentines day menu which features an array of tapas (appetizers) and a paella.  Goat cheese-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates: One of my favorites. It's a little on the sweeter side but the spectrum of flavor in a bite will knock you off your feet.  Crab-stuffed peppers: Also a favorite; it is a pepper stuffed with pimiento cheese and crab served over a saffron sauce, I believe. I would have ordered more of these if I could.  Manchego Cheese: It was just manchego cheese in an oil (maybe rosemary?) Not that impressive  Spicy Garlic Shrimp: Get this. Just do it.   Pork Tenderloin: Whatever sauce came on top of this is delicious. And the pork was cooked perfectly.  Adobo Beef: Also good, but just tastes like any other adobo beef.  Paella Valencia: This paella had mussels, clams, shrimp, chicken, peppers, onions and more. The flavors married well! If it's your first paella, get this one. I think I'll try the lobster and shrimp paella next time.   Mas Fi Rose Champagne - A little on the bitter side. If you're into bitter champagne, this is the one for you.

Order the Drunken Noodle hot, not Thai hot.   Their Mee Krob  is a bit sweet but still pretty good.   Crabs Royal Suite is also good, nothing special though.  Always order Thai Teas at Thai restaurants.  Their sticky rice and mango dessert is also a treat.

WORTH THE WAIT.  I know you've probably stumbled upon yelp because people keep talking about this talking place but every time you attempt to come, there is a dizzying line of people already waiting.  Well you're reading the right review because I'm here to tell you, I am one of the most impatient people in the world but for these tacos, I will gladly wait. (which is exactly what I did last night for an hour, so worth it)  First off, they're dollar tacos. I repeat $1 DOLLAR TACOS.   Here are some things to remember when waiting here:  -The beef tacos are slightly better than the chicken, but just order both because they're a dollar. -You get onions and jalapenos FOR FREE but you have to let the lady you're ordering from know that you want them. - Get extra salsa if you're a spice fan like I am. Extra lime too! -You can't pay with card unless you spend at least 10 dollars (this rule may have changed) -Just buy 10 tacos, just do it. I promise you will eat all of them. -The taco truck is located right outside a gay bar which is why they are nicknamed "gay tacos".  -You will meet some interesting characters in this neck of town. Embrace it. -The horchata is good! No artificial flavoring.

EVERYTHING here is worth ordering. This is a Neo Asian restaurant meaning it's a fuse of Asian foods. Most fusion places I've been too just tasted wrong but this Sochu House know what they're doing. It's also surprisingly cheap for the quality of food you are getting  Here's what I've had:  Pad Thai - They make it with vermicelli noodles instead of egg noodles and it works!  Crispy Fish Papaya Salad - crispy, light and refreshing. If you've never had papaya salad, try it here. They do a great job. The textures in the dish work harmoniously together. Orange Puff - the sauce for this chicken dish is something i've never had before. I can't even say it resembles orange chicken because it's above that Garlic Edamame - They've even made something as simple as edamame superb! Green Tea Cheesecake - you can tell they don't actually make this on location and that it's shipped in, but it's still tasty. I crave this from time to time. Pesto Edamame - Yes, it works! Pesto fans, you will enjoy this. The crunch of the edamame plus the nuttiness of the edamame is a blast in your mouth Sizzling Shrimp - comes out sizzling, the sauce has a nice kick. Not overbearing, just the right amount of flavor Hong Kong Flat Rice - A fun dish! The sauce is mildly sweet, almost resembles a Mongolian sauce. The noodles are dish-like pasta noodles. It will be strange at first chewing them, but if you've ever had mochi before, you will enjoy it!

I work across the street and this little hidden gem is the best! It's inexpensive (well by downtown standards) and the quality is great!  I get their BLT on sourdough toasted - Huge slabs of bacon, bread toasted perfectly. All the contents in this sandwich are perfectly proportioned (add hotsauce)  Pasta salad - nothing too special but it's still delicious. It's an antipasto salad with th right about of meat.  Get their breakfast sandwich on a croissant. It's the perfect thing to start the morning with.   Whatever they have on special is always delicious. I've had their gourmet nachos, buffalo sandwich and roasted vegetable quesadilla.  They also have snacks (i.e. chips, granola bars, candy, pretzel and cheese).   It's the perfect little spot for a quick lunch.  Tip: Call ahead and order for pickup!  Their customer service is impeccable! They seem to remember everyone by name! Or maybe they're just reading all of our name tags haha since the majority of their clientele are office workers.

I'll be honest, I'm kind of a coffee snob and this place is pretty good in my book! The Americanos are brewed with the best espresso beans.

Got the $5 Victoria Pilsner pitcher during happy hour with a coworker. Definitely not a disappointment!  Sat outside; nice busy ambience; right off ASU campus  Bruschetta bread was baked perfectly; soft in the middle with the right amount of crisp on the crust.  I enjoyed all my bruschetta toppings; -pistachio and dates -smoked salmon and pesto -prosciutto and figs -tomato and goat cheese
