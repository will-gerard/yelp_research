phoenix sky harbor international airport is a very big airport!  i accidentally told my husband that he didn't need to pull to the right lane, and we passed the terminal we were supposed to go to. we didn't see any signs saying that you could loop around, so we ended back up on the freeway trying to get back in the right direction. luckily, i made it to my flight on time.  it was a breeze to go through security. the shops in the airport were pretty nice. i'm glad they had a novelty arizona shop because i needed to pick up some last minute gifts for people back home.   the gates are easy to find, and there's lots of seating for all the passengers waiting at their gate.  also, they have outlets so you're able to plug your laptop in before you board your flight to your destination.   glad i land here when i arrive in arizona!

oh, endless shrimp, how i love you!!   the in-laws, my husband and i hit up red lobster after checking into the hyatt place in mesa.   jenna, our server was very nice. she brought out all of our drinks and provided refills (very important) throughout our meal.   i really liked the parmesan shrimp, linguini, scampi and grilled garlic shrimp. mmmmmmm i ate way too much.  wish we had a red lobster on kauai!!

in 2009 i had a custom sticker made at the sticker place.   come to find out that they saved it and had it on file for me to use everytime i come back. i've had the sticker made a couple of times (for my car) and more recently a hoodie jacket for this winter.  the guy that always helps me, miguel, is knowledgeable and knows his stuff. he was able to help me add more things i wanted and made sure that the jackets were pressed twice to ensure that the iron ons would stay for a long, long time.  he's very efficient, too! it only took him 30 minutes to put together my order. will always come back to this place if i need custom stickers/shirts.

we stayed here on our complimentary hyatt nights.  the hyatt regency phoenix was a very nice hotel. when we pulled up to the entrance, the valet were very helpful on where to park. they held our car for about half an hour without charging us while we quickly put our stuff in our room and went on our way.  the room was pretty nice. nothing too spectacular, but really nice for a business hotel.   we were in a room on the 21st floor and the view was pretty amazing!  they have a nice restaurant for dinner on the 24th floor. it's pretty cool, you should check it out.   there were these strange bunny-people statues at the terrace when we were going to breakfast. i thought they were super creepy. breakfast was just mediocre in my opinion, but our waitress, jerry was what made our experience pleasant!  the elevator facing the city was pretty cool to ride in. my eleven month old daughter was surprised every time we'd start moving.  i can't wait to stay here again when we're in phoenix next!

networks is located in the hyatt regency phoenix. it's a pretty cool sports bar-- they've got several large screen tvs for you to watch any game that's on.  i liked that they had booths as well as high-top tables available in the restaurant.   we went two nights in a row for some drinks and a snack. my husband is totally ecstatic that they have fat tire on tap! his favorite beer. we can't get it where we're from.  we had the same server both nights. the first night she was pretty chatty (she talked to us for more than 10 minutes about her vacation to hawaii (because that's where we're from)) and it was a little too much for me. i hadn't seen my husband for over a week and i was on a date with him! but, she was really nice, nonetheless. she was very prompt with service and always got us refills, even without us flagging her down!  the second night, it was a lot busier (probably why she didn't stick around to chat) and we had my sister-in-law and her husband join us. her husband ordered a burger, and it was the biggest burger i've seen stacked that high in my life! he said it was really good. i liked the chicken tenders covered with parmesan-garlic. ask for honey mustard sauce! soooooooooo good!!  hopefully the next time we're back in phoenix, we'll make it here again.

drove up from tucson to see common kings a few fridays back.  the venue is located in scottsdale and is a bar/night club. it was a great setting for an intimate concert.   this chain of venues (they're related to the rialto theatre in tucson) bring in GREAT talent!!  they kept the place cool and the service was very attentive. we never had to ask for more drinks, they were always offering before we had the chance to ask.   also, i like that there was a heavy security presence. it kept people in check and made me feel better about the small venue and how many people were in there.

sushi 101 was recommended by some co-workers who live in phoenix. they were right on with the recommendation.   unfortunately, we missed both happy hours! but the food was still reasonably priced. i got some miso soup which was really tasty, along with the shrimp tempura. my co-worker got a few rolls and some shrimp fried rice which she really enjoyed.  would definitely hit this place up again if given the opportunity!

just saw SOJA at the marquee on tuesday night. we came up from tucson for this concert.  it was pretty easy to find, but once we got there, the parking situation was kind of a mess. when you enter, there's parking to the left but someone told us that you had to pay for the parking there. so we asked one of the lot attendants where we could park and they suggested a parking structure across the street.   so we went on this quest to find parking. after failing at that, we came back and a different attendant told us to turn left out of the parking lot and there was parking on a lower level. we had to walk around near the river and up some stairs, but it was fine. i was glad to park out so far because there was no traffic when we left.  the will call people were nice. my husband forgot his ID in the car (far, far away) and let me use my ID to get the tickets. then, when we entered my husband decided he needed his ID for a beer. even though signs said no re-entry: no exceptions, they made an exception for him!   the marquee was big enough to have quite an audience for the show, but small enough to still feel intimate. the cover band came on and it was pretty hot in there with all the people standing around. they had some industrial fans set up and some air blowing through vents, but it wasn't until the main act came on that they put on the actual air conditioning. praise the lord, or they would have had people fainting! i know it's november, but it's still phoenix and it still got pretty warm in there!  i love the parent company of the marquee, they have some great venues and bring in great talent to arizona. even though this was two hours away, it was worth the drive for us! can't wait to see more great shows in 2014 here!!

i stayed here on business a few weeks ago. my employer didn't make reservations for a me and a couple of my co-workers, so on the day we were supposed to stay, the front desk agent who took our reservation was accommodating and helped us reserve our rooms.   when we checked in, the agent was also very nice. she explained breakfast and checked us into rooms near each other.   this spring hill suites is very nice and well kept. it's quiet and located in a great area (close to arizona mills).   the only thing that was unpleasant was the light shining in my room all night while i tried to sleep. this is entirely my fault because i did not check to see if the curtains were black out curtains. wish i would have known! would have gotten way better sleep, hahahaha.

i have been living in arizona for three years now. L&L is really the only good hawaiian food place we have here that is comparable to home. it's a chain restaurant that we have in hawaii, so there is consistency!   i had the opportunity to stop by again yesterday on our way up the i17 to flagstaff. jared, the guy behind the counter was so nice. he has the spirit of aloha instilled in him! it's such a nice thing to see up here far from home.   the husband and i ordered our usual suspects: chicken katsu and bbq chicken. also, got some mini manapua for the road.   we even stopped again on the way home to tucson (that's how ono it is!) since i know i won't be able to have L&L again til i go home to the islands in may.

taking the elevator up to the 24th floor of the hyatt regency phoenix to the compass restaurant was pretty amazing in itself! the view was spectacular.  the hostess took us to our seat, next to a window. wow!! what a view!! the floor was moving, taking us to see the different sites throughout the city. i thought it was pretty neat that whenever you'd see a plaque on the wall, you could read about what you were looking at and its history.   our server, john, was a very nice guy. he explained the menu as well as a special "restaurant week" menu they had.  my husband and i ordered from the restaurant week menu. it was a three course meal, appetizer, entree and dessert.   i had the grilled romaine salad with blue crab croutons and agave vinaigrette; it was soooooo delicious! who knew that lettuce would be so good grilled?  for our entree, we both had the petite new york with grilled shrimp and a garlic mash with peppercorn demi. the steak was cooked to perfection. i wish i could say the same for the shrimp. it was just a little undercooked.   for dessert, i ordered the signature compass fudge brownie and caramel flan. it was really, really good!! the husband ordered the sopaipillas with custard. he wasn't a big fan of the crust, but really liked the custard. john, our server, bought us the molten chocolate cake. it was just alight.   this restaurant was really nice, and i would recommend it if you're looking for something different and romantic!

the hubs and i drove up to mesa amphitheatre this past thursday to see the good vibes summer tour 2013: featuring rebelution, matisyahu and collie buddz. doors were at 330PM and we got there around 5PM.   *tip: if you'd like to bring in bottled water, make sure it's factory sealed. we brought a nalgene and had to take it back to the car. would have been nice to know because i paid for a bottle of dasani water at $3.50/ea.   they had a beer garden with lots of attendants and no lines. it was great! the prices at their venue are pretty steep, though.   the really cool thing about this amphitheatre is the terraced seating they have. i wish i had taken a photo to share! the terracing provided comfortable seating for many, many people. the area in front of the stage was left open so a large amount of people could stand and dance.   the sound people are right in the middle of the terracing and they had pop up tents, but as soon as the sun went down/shade covered them enough they took their tents down which was really considerate of them! i thought they'd be up the entire night. the crew did a great job with the sounds/lighting effects during the show.  there were lots of security and personnel around which was good because it made you feel safe, especially with such a large amount of people. they even had EMS on scene near the beer garden area just in case!  i would love if tucson could have an amphitheatre just as nice as this one! can't wait to check out more shows here.

my first-ever experience at one of roy yamaguchi's restaurants was on my tiny little island in the middle of the pacific ocean. poipu, kauai, hawaii to be exact. and since my fist experience, roy's restaurants never fail to amaze me.  this was a special occasion because it happened to be my birthday!! my husband and i decided to do something special and spend the weekend away from tucson and drive up to the phoenix area. i was excited to find a local favorite of mine from back home up here on the mainland.   i made my special birthday dinner reservation and was even excited that they answered the phone with a friendly 'aloha'.  as expected, we were seated at a nice, intimate table. the one thing i love about roy's is how personalized he makes your experience. because they knew i was coming in for my birthday dinner, they made a nice little insert for the menus brought to our table. when we were done ordering, they rolled the inserts up and gave them to us to have as keepsakes.   our server was gracious and kind the entire evening.  the husband had a combination of two types of seafood -- fish and scallops (that were hugeeeee!!) and i got the filet mignon. everything was cooked to perfection. of course we had to get the chocolate soufflé for desert. you can't ever go to roy's and not get chocolate soufflé. it should be against the law. it has to be the best desert on the face of the earth [in my humble opinion]. to top that off, they even brought out their signature flourless chocolate complete with candle and our server took our picture and framed it to also take home.  we both left fat & happy. if i could have it my way, i'd choose roy's restaurant for every special occasion we celebrate because the people that work for roy always go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect.   mahalo nui loa a hui hou, roy's chandler! hope to see you soon!

chandler fashion center was very big!! we grabbed a directory and planned our route.  they had a lot of your basic stores--something you'd find in your everyday, run of the mill mall. except that these stores were on steroids! the forever 21 i walked into was magnificent!!  it would be good to spend and entire shopping day here.

stayed here because we wanted to get out of tucson a night earlier to start our anniversary weekend get away. we saw this place on groupon and while they didn't have availability to book on groupon, their front desk agent matched the price for us.  the hotel is a shell of what used to be a nicer hotel under different management. it used to be the four points, but now is called the inn place. for the price, you can't really expect much more than what we got.  the hotel is very tired and needs updating. the rooms were okay. bed was comfortable but pillows were very uncomfortable. the amenities were sparse.   we woke up the next morning and had their $5 breakfast buffet. you have the option to purchase it at check in for that price. if you don't, i think it's $9. powdered eggs and gross sausage, fatty bacon and yucky potatoes.   will definitely never stay here agin.

long day in phoenix and on the way back we stopped over in casa grande to get some grub.  the husband suggested this place because he had read about it when we were on a different vacation and said we should try it.  i've never had french food before, so i was struggling with what i was looking at on the menu. some of the words were just too complicated for me to even pronounce! haha.  ended up with the turkey dinner. it wasn't very hot when it came out. very little dressing.  husband got french onion soup, the kid got mac n cheese.  had to get up and find the waitress to ask for more gravy and a refill on my soft drink because she never came back to check on us. it's not like it was busy. maybe had 2 other tables.

wild horse pass hotel and casino was our destination this past weekend to celebrate our four year wedding anniversary.  we're really glad we chose this place. it's a new facility and it has beautiful rooms and views.   at check in, brett was a great help. our reservations were separated into two and he made sure that we were going to be able to stay in the same room for both nights. we were given a room on the 10th floor (which is the highest floor) and had a great view of the pool and surrounding desert.   the room was very clean and well put together. the air conditioning gets very cold which is great for the triple digit weather we got over the weekend there.   my husband likes to gamble so it was also convenient that right down stairs was a very large casino with so many slot machines and card table to choose from. you really don't even need to leave their property because they seem to have it all. from entertainment to food, etc. they even have a beautiful new premium outlet mall that boasts 90 shops with in walking distance from the casino.   we enjoyed every aspect of our stay and would love to visit again soon! thanks for making out fourth anniversary a memorable one.

i usually don't review starbucks because they're generally all the same.  this one was just not up to their brand standards, though. you can see on other reviews some of the issues i will mention here.  staff wasn't very friendly upon arrival. i ordered a hot beverage in the middle of a hot summer day. yes, i know what i ordered. why are you questioning me? O_o also, if you're going to ask my name, and then ask me to spell it to you, please try to listen. no point in having me spell it to you for you to get something completely different! #unusualnameproblems  it took about 10 minutes for my drink to be made. the guy that took my order just rang me up and walked away leaving the drive-thru barista to hop over to the other bar to make my drink. she didn't seem too pleased. sad thing was this translated into grumpy customer service.  i sat down in the room with all the tables and notices that there wasn't really any air flow. it was at least 104 degrees outside, but inside wasn't cool and refreshing like you expect starbucks to be.   after sitting a while more, i began to notice how quiet it was in this area with all the tables. i could hear all the baristas bantering back and forth but there was no music!! music adds to the ambiance that IS starbucks.   it was just a weird experience all together. thank god there are tons of them around so next time i can just pick an entirely different store to visit.

had an early morning taking my mom up to phoenix sky harbor from tucson. stopped here on the way back because the husband wanted pancakes.  i don't really like breakfast, so i like that these diners let you order from the entire menu all day long.   the husband got some blueberry pancakes and eggs. everything was good on his part. i got the fried chicken dinner (was going to save some for lunch/dinner later that day, too). it came with a soup (but the soup didn't make it out to our table until after the dinner came). besides the soup, nothing else was good.   it didn't appear to be busy when we walked in, but service was super slow. the waitress never offered to refill waters. i always had to ask and then it took 10 minutes each time for her to come back.

how can you beat $6.99 steak & eggs? the husband loved them so much he had them two days in a row!! they were cooked perfectly!  i had the chicken strips the first day which were okay. the baked mac and cheese the second day. they were alright, typical diner food.   i liked that the service was quick and that the staff was friendly. also, the fact that they completely separate the casino from the restaurant is great. no smoke or ding-ding-dings from the machines!

couldn't decide what to eat while in this area of chandler before seeing a movie. the hubs had never been here and the last time i ate at an old spaghetti factory was over ten years ago. since i always get to pick, i let him pick.  he picked this. the hostesses let us peruse  the menu before we were definite on our decision of eating here.   once seated, our server brought water and gave us a few more minutes to decide on what we wanted.  hubs got the managers special, a half meat sauce and half mushroom sauce combo. i opted for the fettuccine alfredo and asked for garlic to be added. our server suggested i try their new garlic alfredo.  sure glad i took her suggestion! it was delicious. hubs liked his selection as well.   their entrees come with a soup or salad and bread too. also the option of iced tea, etc. and and the end, spumoni or vanilla ice cream.

we went to the cresent ballroom for a railroad earth show on my husband's birthday.  parking was relatively easy to find down the street, so that was a plus.  there was a bar/dining area in the front, and then the main ballroom where the show was. it fit a lot of people. i believe there are seats you could have paid for that are bench style if you're not for standing up at a concert.  the only thing i wasn't super stoked about was that the patio allowed smokers and it wafted into the bar area.

irashaimase!!  welcome to i sushi & teppan!!   we were seated at a teppanyaki table and waited a few minutes before our server came back to get our drink orders. joe was very friendly and very efficient in his job.   i had read a few excellent reviews before choosing i sushi (we also had a groupon). we were celebrating our 4th wedding anniversary and wanted to do something different.   what i didn't realize (and i should have because now i remember it being mentioned in another review) was that you share your teppanyaki table with other guests. we were seated with four other people, which was fine, but made it a little awkward.  the husband got the poke bowl (recommended by jolly m) and he absolutely loved it. the taste reminded him of poke from home (hawaii). this is something that we can't get out here in the desert on a regular basis. also ordered edamame which was steamed and seasoned with salt.   for the teppan i got a filet mignon dish. daniel was our teppan chef. he was friendly and very entertaining. he has been cooking for over 7 years. very skilled and talented. it was a pleasure watching him cook!   another thing i got a kick out of was that they have a live feed of their sushi chef preparing sushi behind the bar. you can watch this on a television from across the room. sushi itself is such a beautiful art!   if we lived in chandler (we're now living in tucson) we'd probably come here more often! would definitely come back and recommend to people.      arigato gozaimasu i sushi & teppan!!

holy sugar rush.   so many options of different kinds of sweets & candies at IT'SUGAR.   we were gone from our four-year-old over the weekend and this place was a good find to pick up something for her.  the greatest find: astronaut ice cream (freeze dried icecream). this stuff is awesome. it brings me back to when i was a kid!!

beautiful new premium outlets located near wild horse pass. the outlets just opened and boasts 90 stores.  not all of the shops are open just yet, but many of them are open for business and have great deals on name brand merchandise. this outlet mall is conveniently located right off of the i-10 on the outskirts of chandler.  can't wait to visit again while in the area!

got to see furious 6 here this past weekend.  i like harkens theaters because they're comfortable and clean. the quality of the picture and sound is also very good.  staff was nice at the box office. the girl taking our ticket after we walked in look bored out of her mind and could learn to smile, but, hey, whatever! haha
