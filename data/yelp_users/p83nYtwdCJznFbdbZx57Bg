Very bad service tonight!!! We are coming here, on and off for the last 9 years were living in this neighborhood and it use to be one of our favors!!! But.... tonight??? Terrible!!! I can't figure out how you Manuel's Management hire this waitress??? She doesn't belong here!!! Not at this location anyway!!! Even tough we called and made a reservation, she acted like she was doing us a favor... her services was lousy and her attitude terrible!!! No class! No customer service! No comments!!! Were most likely think twice before were coming back!!! Very sad :(:(:(

My favor restaurant! My husband and I, are going to Razz for many years. Razz is an exceptional chef. He's serving the most sophisticated food. The staff is very friendly and professional and Janel is the best bartender! She always remember what we drink and her mix drinks are the best:)

Best Thai food I ever taste! My favor is Pad See-ew chicken or pork. It's delicious! All their dishes are very good and flavorful. The owner is very nice and friendly. Try it! You won't regret it! Grate deal for lunch special!

The best European Pastry's I ever found in the Phoenix-Metro Area. If you are used to have a beautiful and very tasty European Pastry's for the Holidays and don't have the time to make it, this is the place to pick-up some goodies for any event! Always Very fresh! Also try their bread it is Best in Town!

I had my botox and filler done by Charles couple of times now and he did an awesome job. He's very professional and very low pain level. Love Glo Medspa!!!
