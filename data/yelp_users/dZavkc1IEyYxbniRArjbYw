I'm really very impressed with this place. I brought in my favorite sheet set that had a tear in the pillow sham and the duvet cover. It's a colorful, stripped sheet set and not only did she rush the job for me (because they're my favorites!), but they even changed the thread they used to fix it as the colors of the fabric changed with the stripes. The owner of the store is super cute, it's clearly a family business, the work was top notch and the price was very low. I'l definitely return the next time I need something done and highly recommend this place. A++

Amazing fries and burger. Can't wait to go back. Great ambiance. Large draft beer selection. Thumbs up.

I was really impressed. The office staff was very friendly and helpful; I even had to move the date up by three weeks and they bent over backwards to squeeze me in. The prices were very affordable and the actual move was perfect. The 2 guys were really nice and friendly, took really great care of our stuff, and had us packed up and unloaded in 2 hours. I'm very happy with this business and will most assuredly use again for my next move. Thanks, guys, keep up the good work!

I am astounded at all the positive reviews. This place was nasty and overpriced. Yeah, the manager came by with a free, gimmicky, baby cookie, but that doesn't make up for the horrid food. The turkey was dry, the macaroni'n'cheese tasted about as processed as it gets and the vegetables were dry and flavorless. One visit here and I'm donezo. Normally I don't hate a place this much and then get instantly compelled to review it on Yelp, but anyone reading this, go to Jason's Deli or even Subway... BOO!

Huge fan of Barossa at Paradise Ridge. Moved in in December 2010 and enjoyed our stay for a year and moved to the east coast. After a few short months, we're moving back in for another year at Barossa. The complex is new, modern and attractive. Great for dogs with the large open area next to the property and the nature preserve behind it. The pool and hot tub are nice, we actually used the BBQ area, and the exercise room is pretty nice, too. The best part about Barossa is the staff. Stacey, Ron and team really, really impress me. They've gone out of their way for me numerous times and it's obvious they take great pride in the community. I'll be frank, no property is perfect, especially if you fail to keep in context this is an apartment complex with a lot of people living in a small space. Sure, I've hear my neighbors a few times, the parking can get tight on the weekends, but keep it all in perspective. Rent is reasonable, it's all new and very modern/attractive, you're right in N. Scottsdale, walking distance from Life Time Fitness, close to shopping and parks... if you're not able to own your own home in N. Scottsdale and need to rent, Barossa is a no-brainer if you ask me. Very happy resident and look forward to returning.

Not impressed. It's sad to see that a business owner sank a bunch of cash into a place, building a fabulous patio and large screen TVs all over the place... but the food was terrible. Hummus gross, veggies dry, burger bun ruined the burger... our waitress even failed to ask how the food was, but she was very nice.   The other comments on Cougar Den are hilarious.... now that I think about it, my friend and I were totally the only people there under 30 besides the staff.   All in all - the food was the #1 reason I'll never be back. Shame, nice place and good location, too.
