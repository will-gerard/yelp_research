Don't let the strip mall setting deter you.  This restaurant has some of the best tasting fish in town.  When you walk in, the servers are very friendly and quick to seat you.  They recently expanded so it doesn't feel as cramped as before.  The quality of the tuna is the best I've had in town.  When you bite down your teeth easily cut through the fish while keeping a good tuna consistency.  The prices are not inflated like your typical Scottsdale sushi restaurant.  They even have appetizer specials where you buy a bottle of Kirin and you get a choice of 6 appetizers for only $.50!  I highly recommend this place to any fan of great sushi with equal service.

Carolinas is pure happiness.  I go there atleast once a week.  The tortillas are made fresh and the salsa is amazing.  There's not a single item on the menu that I don't enjoy eating.  For a great deal go with the #3 combo which comes with a tostada, enchilada, beef taco, rice and beans all under $5.50

The price is a little high for me.  They don't give enough bean sprouts without asking for more.  The pho broth is a little too sweet for me also
