A budget hotel that doesn't feel like a budget hotel? I'm sold. Granted, I was a bit hesitant when I saw the gaudily-lit up casino attached to it, but once you step inside, you'll forget it's even there.  First win: no smell of smoke on the property. I've stayed in my fair share of crappy Vegas hotels (don't ask), and even if the building says non-smoking, there is always a faint musk about the place. None of that here.  Second win: INCREDIBLY friendly and helpful staff. Everyone time I came down - friendly, polite, just awesome. And they were dealing with a mass of humanity, having muddy obstacle racers descend on them for the weekend (the cleaning staff's worst nightmare). Still, friendly as ever.  Third win: Clean, comfy spacious rooms.   Fourth win: Price. $65ish a night. I normally get roach motels for that.   Fifth win: Other things I can't remember right now.  Only knock is that the wifi would disconnect after I left my computer idle too long, which was a tad annoying trying to get work done and required another code, etc. And you aren't allowed to take food out of the breakfast area - I understand the reasoning, but I like to eat in the peace of my own room (but who can complain about free things? Apparently, I am).  Overall, fantastic experience. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat when racing brings me back to Henderson.

Fantastic wine bar in the Old Town area, and surprisingly affordable. They accommodated a large bachelorette party (eyeroll, I know), and even gave us a special dessert for the bachelorette.   I had to do double takes to check the wine bottles prices - incredible selections for extremely cheap. And there's a list of 10% on the back of inventory that they need to move.  Wine bars can typically disappoint with food - small plates, portions, and just mediocre. Not the case - portions were reasonable, and every hard-to-please girl was happy. Highly recommend the bruschetta sampler as a starter.  Cute patio, live music. Overall, a hit.

Passable, but underwhelming. Perhaps I screwed myself by reading glowing Yelp reviews and expected much more, but the place smacked more of "trashy" (in line with other Old Town places) and less "classy." Aside from the decor, not much classy about it. Skeevy/douchey dudes just hovering? Check. Sticky floors from booze? Check. Drunk idiots abound? Check. Oddly enough, on a Friday around 10pm, it was pretty empty (yet all of these things still existed).   Perhaps it's more of a happy hour spot, but something with the place wasn't working.

I was running a race in Lake Las Vegas, and I hate Vegas, so I took my chances with a place in Henderson. Really happy that I picked this place. I was a bit apprehensive driving through Henderson as it's quite run down, but the hotel itself is in great shape.   Rooms are clean and spacious, staff is friendly and helpful, and rates are very reasonable. Free continental breakfast, free parking. I was there for less than 12 hours, but had everything I needed.   The rest of the places in Henderson look rather iffy, but you can have faith in this one.

Looking for your stereotypical brunch place after a morning run, we stumbled up Snooze AM (thanks to Yelp). Bright, cheery, and clean, it's what you'd expect from an upscale brunch chain.   Coffee was great and refills plentiful. Plenty of options, savory and sweet. The omelets were done well, and the hashbrowns were...unique. In a good way. Portions weren't grossly large, which I actually appreciate in a restaurant. Quality, not quantity.  Server was a bit of a space cadet and service was pretty slow, but it may have been a one-off, so I can't knock the place for that.
