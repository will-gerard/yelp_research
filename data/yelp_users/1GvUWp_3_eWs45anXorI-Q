Beware!!!  My mother had her credit card number lifted while lunching at the bar yesterday.  They ran all over Tempe and Mesa purchasing clothes etc.  The Fraud department from the bank flagged the purchases, thank god.  I phoned the restaurant this morning and spoke with manager CeCe.  Instead of taking ownership she choose to explain to me how this never happens there and that she could not address her staff but would try and find time to discuss with her managers.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!  Ownership of an issue is critical.

Tony and his staff (our waiter was Chad) are amazing.  Help a private event there recently Tony went so above and beyond to make us feel welcome and special he now has six new committed fans.  The food was beyond amazing.  When Chad introduced himself he began by saying just know what ever the question is the answer is YES.  That's how we roll here.  He set the tone for the evening and never let us down.  Perfect evening, perfect staff!!!!  Thank you Tony for making our evening extra special.

Lived in this area for 17+ years and have finally found a nail salon I am excited to go to.  Decor is sleek and clean.  NO smells and everyone knows your name and makes you feel glad you are coming and spending your time and money there.  Locally owned, family lives in the Cave Creek area, and operated.  Owner is present and welcoming most every time I am there.  One of the many great features, they LOVE parties and have a liquor license.  Every service you are offered a free cocktail of your choice, home made Sangria on the weekends.  Their operators take pride and enjoy their work.  The owner has created a great team environment.  For all you get their pricing is very reasonable.  Head on down to City North (High Street) you will want to bring your friends, family and little ones again and again!  Nice place to escape all the sports on Sundays ladies or if you like she will turn on the game for you, for some secret football lady time.  ha!
