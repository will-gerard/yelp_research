Was invited to dinner here by a good friend, part of a group of 7. The service was top notch and we immediately got our basket of fresh tasty warm biscuits and corn bread. For appetizers we got Onion Rings and Shrimp Cocktail. Excellent. For main, wifey chose the Prime Rib, grilled "Stockyards" style, she says it was fantastic. I tried the Rib Eye and this was one of the better steaks I've had in recent memory. Everyone loved everything served and was a great dinner. Highly recommend.

What a great cigar shop/lounge. We came here from friends recommendations and glad we did. The man working, Cole, was beyond helpful, recommended several great sticks and I ended up buying many more. Great place to relax and smoke too. All friendly people. Will be returning soon.

We heard about this place and decided we had to try it out. Drove way the hell out Craig in N Vegas to find it. Place is dark inside and decorated with a cross between Mexican Revolutionary and Farmer. Staff was very friendly and actually very good. We ordered appetizer of the Quesadilla that was damn good. Also the chips, salsa and bean dip that was great as well. I had the Enchilada, Taco and Burrito combo. This was good, only drawback was kinda room temperature, not hot. The parts that I ate were very tasty. Scary when the meat is only room temperature, so doubtful that I will return.

If you like hard core ethnic Mexican food, you'll love this place. We go every now and again and are always smiling when we leave. Most of the staff speak little or no English and we have to point to items pictured on the menu, but it's always tasty and they are very friendly. I have no idea of what I ordered, some kind of Asada, but was hella good. Worth the stop.

What can be said about Caps' Bobby? Everything, it's my favorite all time sandwich! It's the best. This location has very friendly people and it's always clean and nice. We always stop by here on our way out of town and they have no problem with making my wife her special sandwich.

In the area so we tried it out. We had a hard time finding it since its on the MLK side even though the address is Craig. Anyhow, the restaurant is much bigger than it looks outside. Pretty nicely decorated with lots of tables and booths. Really tasty chips and salsa were promptly on the table. Wifey tried the Chile Verde Chimichanga. She loved it. I had the Carnitas and they were really great. The food was better then we expected and will be returning. Great to have this place in our neighborhood.

Our group of 10 decided to try the Golden Steer on a recent Friday night.  Our reservations were easy and arrived to be treated like regulars by very friendly and professional staff. Immediately was impressed with the vibe of the place. Great looking bar, lots of dark wood and comfortable chairs. We all sat around in the bar waiting for the rest of our group. As we all arrived and were seated, the wait staff and manager made sure nothing was missed. No point in detailing the steaks, all the reviews were right, food is awesome. Service for us was perfect. We will be returning here often for all of the above reasons. Also, I have bought many large dinners in high-end Las Vegas Steakhouses. But this was the first time I got out for less than $900 for 10 adults. Yes I dig this place.

Have to this place several times, with late night groups and for dinner for two. Have also done take-out. Have never been disappointed. The service is very good, the food is always great. The Salt and Pepper Pork Chops are always a must have.

Since this place is near our Vegas home, we've been wanting to hit it for a while. There is a serious lack of dinner options in our part of town. Any how, made reservations on Thursday for Saturday night, no issues. We arrived at 7pm to find a jammed packed restaurant. But were seated immediately, huge plus in my book.for as busy as they were, our waitress was on it. Took the drink order, Wifey says her Bloody Mary was great. Rest of us had iced tea. Did 3 appetizers, the Ranch Wings, the Mushrooms and Crab Cakes. All were good, nothing awesome, but good. For main course, I did the Porterhouse, Wifey did Lobster with Filet, Son #2 had the Porterhouse, Son #3 had the Sirloin and our friend had the Filet.  My Porterhouse was perfect, I mowed through it. I also had the baked potato and the Lobster Bisque soup, damn good. Wifey says her Lobster was crazy good, but she took her Filet home for later.  Son #2 reported his Porterhouse was dry and half was over cooked. Son #3 disappeared his Sirloin and reported it was great, he also loved the Crab Cake appetizer. Over all, a great dinner with exception of Son #2 getting a over cooked Porterhouse. But when I saw the giant open fire grill, completely covered in steaks, I realized I'd of over cooked one or three of them too. This place is a prize, I love anywhere in Las Vegas that is not full of tourists. Would recommend.

Decent selection, well stocked humidor and good prices. The location of this place is it's only drawback. But it is what it is. The reason for 5 stars? Service, service service. I've been to allot of cigar stores, but have yet to encounter the super friendly and helpful folks here. Worth the stop.

After driving by for years we stopped by late one Friday night. I tried the number 32 I think, steak/cheese/peppers an onions. The last time I had a Cheesesteak like this was at Pats in Philadelphia. This was damn near exact what I remember. Very good. Wifey had the Pastrami. She reports that it was meh. Kinda plain. But it is a Cheesesteak joint.  The place it's self is all kinda nasty. It's perfect.  Will definitely return.

Wifey and I travel allot, we always search out unique places for the experience and quality food. Michaels is the best at everything they do. First and foremost, it is not "trendy". There are no fries covered with toppings, there is no Pork Belly glazed with Maple or God knows what.  There is however some of the freshest fish, best beef and salads anywhere along with outstanding service.  It is very old school and the Waiters are the best we have seen.  Dinner here starts with a wonderful Garnish tray that among other things include Quail Eggs, Olives, Pickles, Cucumbers and Beats. They also give you toasted Dark Bread with Parmesan cheese, and crackers, etc. On this particular visit, I ordered the Live Maine Lobster. This thing was a Monster, huge. Cooked to perfection, I selected broiled. They dress the Lobster table side.  I also had the French Onion soup, the best I've ever had.  The sides were Cream Corn and a Baked Potato.  I could go on and on, but one must try this place, you will love it.  One last thing, dress nice, there is a dress code and bring your money. On this visit, there were 5 of us, $1500.00. And I can't wait to go back.

We've been here before, but this is our first review. We made reservations for a party of 5 for our Sons birthday. Seated as soon as we arrived by very professional and friendly Hosts. As soon as we sat there were two waiters there for drink orders. Wifey and I started off with the VIP cocktail. This is a must have. We all ordered Steaks and Lobster. There were many cocktails and this restaurant went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful time. Everything was excellent and I don't know what could have made it a better evening with my Sons.

We stopped by here for dinner with our friend who lives near by. The place was fairly busy but were seated without a wait. Of course the first thing we ordered was the TCT Mexican pizza, essentially a huge tortilla crispy and covered with melted cheese. This was sent back, was lacking cheese. We also ordered the Trio Dip, this was good. I ordered the Grilled Salmon with Green Enchiladas. The Enchilada was tasty, the Salmon was a dry, over cooked wooden like slab of nasty. Wifey ordered the Carnitas Enchiladas and she reported hers were very good. The service was a bit hit an miss, and overall the place came over as a tourist trap. I would be hard pressed to return here or recommend.

We were recommended to Dr. Twesme by a friend who has used him for years.getting an appointment was easy, and the staff on the phone were all very courteous. After another Dentist just the day before tried to tell us my Son needed oral surgery and general anesthesia to pull 2 wisdom teeth, we are very glad we walked out and came here. The Dr took one look at my Sons X-rays, told him that he could have general anesthesia if he wanted, but recommended just a local. Long story short, we were there less then 45 minutes total, the Dentist who was very nice and professional removed both wisdom teeth with no surgery, just simple extractions.  I highly recommend Dr Twesme.

We were invited here by friends. I was a little apprehensive since they called it a "dive bar". I have been to some pretty sketchy places in this town that call themselves dive bars. This particular bar is cool. Very clean and does not smell like an ashtray. The drinks were great, and so was the food. Great little place.

Have been here several times and have done take out a few times as well. This place is known for their Tamales and that's the best thing here by far. Always moist with good proportion of masa and filling. My favorites are the Pork. The rest of their food is OK, above average Mexican fare.

Had occasion to stay here recently due to a having an evening planned there. First of all, this place is showing its age a bit. The Front Desk staff were OK, a little rushed and not too friendly. Getting to your room here is a hassle. I'm a bit resentful of being forced to drag our bag through the entire casino to get to the elevators. I'm also resentful of paying $252.00 for an old room and getting shanked for a $25.00 "resort fee". This is just a straight rip off, a "because we can F*ck You" fee.

Having a vacation home in Las Vegas, the only reason we visit the strip is for dining options. One of our main stays for late night and breakfast has been the Peppermill for years. The place is always busy, normally a fun crowd and the food is always pretty good. Last night at midnight, we finally got around to dinner and headed here. I tried the Chicken Parmesan, and it was tasty. Wifey had the Chorizo and Eggs...always good here.

We've been here several times, overall it's a great concept, but lately it's just turning into another tourist trap in Vegas. Noisy, crowded and the food doesn't make up for it. Soggy limp waffle, runny undercooked eggs and rush service. 10 minute wait between visits from the server who mostly acted like she needed us to leave so she get another 4 top in. Used to be great, but better stuff to be had without the wait.  Good Bloody Mary's though! But pass if you want good food.

We came here for lunch based on reviews. First of all, this place is not nearly as good as I thought it was going to be. Second, it's loud, too loud for us. I tried the Tuna Melt and it was as basic and plain as any I've had anywhere. My friend tried the Pastrami and had two bites and did not finish. Another friend had the Shrimp Salad and it was overly spicy and she could not finish.  Won't be back and would not recommend.

We stopped by here since we were dropping people off at the airport, and we are always looking for good Pho and Vietnamese sandwiches. Very friendly people working and fast service, noticed first off the place is clean and bright. Wifey had the Chicken with Clear Noodles, which was great. I had the Grilled Beef Sand, it was fantastic. The French roll tasted like it was baked this morning. Great place and recommend.

This was one of our best dining experiences in Scottsdale. We had reservations for 6 at 8pm on a Saturday night. We arrived to a packed restaurant and told to wait. The hostess quickly explained there was issues with our reservations and offered us their private dining room. Sweet. The service was great.  I went with the Deluxe Platter, was a bit pricey, but was one of the best looking and tasting Sashimi platters I've ever tried. Wifey went with the Tempura Veggies and the Ribs. Both were excellent. The others in our party have everything from the Sushi Rolls to the Japanese  Wagyu. Everything was prepared expertly and tasted fantastic. Highly recommend.

Was surprised to find how easy the appointment is made, the girl taking the calls was very friendly. I called on Friday, they promised Sunday AM, no extra charge. As I had 3 appliances needing repair, I was given 3 automated reminder calls at the same time and received 3 emails. As Jay worked on things, had to write 3 separate checks, A bit annoying but no big deal. Sunday morning Jay called, said he was on his way and was there in 15 minutes. Jay was extremely professional and courteous and seemed to know what he was doing. But, my repair turned out to be a order parts and will return in a few days...to be continued. . .so long story short, took a little longer than anticipated, but did get everything in working order.

We've had vacation home in NW Vegas for a few years but only recently rediscovered the Galaxy theaters. Let me say, it rocks. We just came back from seeing Unfriended and really enjoyed this theater. Parking is a breeze with lots of spaces right outside the doors. Nice snack bar with lots of tasty choices. Today I hammered a Footlong Chili Cheese Dog. Hell ya. Wifey had a few bites and Popcorn was fresh and great as well. Love the pick your own seat option and the reclining chairs are sweet. Would recommend.

We came here with friends for a Monday night dinner. Great atmosphere as soon as we walked in.  We ordered up the meat and cheese board and it was awesome, especially the Roasted Olives. Wifey ordered the Cavatelli Porchetta, and this was the stand out dish on the table. Excellent. I tried the Spicy Seafood Fettuccine, was very good. Our friends have Yelp as well, so I'll let them review their dishes. The service was a bit slow, but the flavor and quality of the food more than made up for it.

This review is only for the Luxury Boxes at Lagasse Stadium. We have used them twice and both time have come away very pleased with the Service, amenities and food. This trip was for Thursday night football and we were a group of 6. We ordered all the usual suspects when it came to finger foods, Nachos, Sliders, Smothered Fries, everything was great.  We always reserve Box 1, since there is a Pool table outside the doors. Perfect for cigars. This place is worth the expense.

Stopped by for a Pinks Chili Cheese dog. Was a Wednesday afternoon and no line. The chick working was super friendly and was served within 5 minutes of arriving. Also got a tasty lemonade. The Chili dog was really good and fresh bun. Would recommend as long as not a crazy line. I'd hit it again, but wouldn't stand on line for it.

We decided to plan a family Birthday here, made reservations with their great online system. Our group of 5 and were seated promptly at a good table. Only 6 other tables, so we were expecting the best. Nope.  Server was great and first off we ordered a round of shots for the Birthday boy, this took 10 minutes. No biggie. She finally came back and we ordered appetizers, Seafood platter and 2 Roast Beet Salads.  This seemed to take forever again. Finally after 40 minutes she returned and took dinner orders.  More bread baskets, more drinks, no bus service, dirty dishes stacking up.  After 1 hour and 40 minutes, meals finally came out, 2 of were plated wrong, watched as the server removed a Lobster Tail off one plate and relocate to another. After the confusion of trying to convince the food runners who ordered what, we were set.  I ordered the French Onion soup, was very good. Also had the Filet, which was good too. Wifey had the Prime Rib and hers was good as well. Our friend had the Petit Lobster tail. It was cooked down to mush. Sent back. Our Son had the Surf n Turf. Steak was good, jumbo Lobster Tail was raw in the middle, sent back. Another 15 minutes, they brought back the Lobsters, the small one was perfectly cooked, Jumbo was of course still raw and cold in the center...we were running on 2 hours by this time and he just ate the cooked parts.  The Manager made an apology and comped the Lobsters. So felt a little better. But if I'm dropping 500 bucks for dinner, kinda hoping for just a little better then Outback Steakhouse and Glacier slow service.  Won't be back.

Stopped by on an afternoon when out in that part of town. Only 3 people there and they were watching football and smoking cigars, my kinda place. The humidor was nicely stocked, and I grabbed a couple of boxes that I'd been looking for. Got a nice little 10% off in the boxes and he threw in a magazine I wanted. Earned a customer right there. I will return.

Wifey and I frequent cigar lounges from Seattle to San Diego on a regular basis. I have to say Scottsdale Cigar Club is near the top of the list of our favorites. On our first visit, the owner made us feel like we were coming home. He took the time to personally show us every cigar on hand and tell us in detail all about the sticks I was unfamiliar with.  Fantastic seating with no less than 8 big screens to watch the Football game.  I would recommend this place to anyone interested in a great place to smoke or buy cigars.

I went in and was helped by a super friendly guy who knew instantly what battery I needed. 30 minutes later, alarm system all good. Great store!

Have stayed here several times, always for 4 or 5 nights and can only review the Executive Suites on the upper floors. This hotel is a classy operation. The staff from Valet/Bell to Room Service has always been fast, friendly and consistent. The rooms are very nice, kept clean with great amenities. Fantastic views from the higher floors anyhow. Overall a great casino and resort.

We found this place using Yelp of course. Have never had much luck in this part of Phoenix with breakfast, so happy we found Biscuit.  We arrived to find they have a huge parking lot, and it was full! Got inside to be told it would be 30 minutes, but actually only took 10.  I ordered their Biscuit plate special, with grits. It was great, fantastic gravy, great bacon and perfect grits. Wifey ordered the South Mountain plate, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy. She loved it. We shared a single pancake and it was awesome. Will return and recommend.

This is a very cool little cigar lounge stashed away in the Talking Stick resort. We came in so we could watch World Series and smoke. They have a small selection of cigar, but don't mind if you bring your own, as long as you buy drinks. Nice place that's also very upscale and comfortable.

Was turned onto this place by a friend. We went on a Saturday morning to find a 25 minute wait. I was a little skeptical since breakfast in Vegas is RARELY worth a wait. Once seated was impressed by how fast and friendly everyone was. Wifey tried the Loco Moco with Garlic Rice. This was fantastic, really very good. I tried the Huevos Ranchero with green salsa...damn good. We both shared the Bacon Pancakes, delicious. Coffee was never empty and great. This was worth the wait. Great breakfast spots are hard to find. Will return many times.

This place is pretty good. Have had dinners here a couple of times, so time to catch up on my Yelping. Reservations for 8 on a Thursday night. Seated quickly. First thing you notice is the place is LOUD, but that also seems to be trendy these days. I had the Short Rib Green Chili Stew, which is always very good here. Wifey went with the Fried Chicken, this was ok. Not great, little too much with the honey drizzle making it more sweet than anything else. We wanted the Charcuterie board, but our Waiter forgot to put our order in, so that will remain a mystery. If your feeling the need for a hipster/trendy joint, this place will fit the bill. Nothing spectacular, but great location means we'll be back.

We found this place while looking for breakfast on Yelp. We arrived to find a crowded restaurant on a Monday morning. Said there would be 15 minute wait and it was. Place is very bright and airy and very clean, so the wait was enjoyable, more or less.  I ordered the Mexicana Omelette, filled with Chorizo and covered with green sauce. It was damn good! Wifey ordered the Country Benny. She loved hers as well. This place is going to be seeing more of us.

We were in the area at our favorite movie theater across the street and decided to see if this place lived up to the hype.  We walked in and found a clean well Kaye's out little place. First off loved the chalkboard menus hanging throughout. And you can see the entire kitchen.  I tried the Porchetta Sandwich and I couldn't eat it fast enough. This was excellent. My Sons tried the Five Cheese Pesto pizza and the Carnivore. They both gave thumbs up and say it the best pizza they've had this area. We also tried the Lentil Soup and was blown away on how tasty it was. This place is now our go to pizza spot for the NW Valley.

Review for deliver only. We had friends over and went with the "it's too damn hot to cook" option. Ordered 3 pies and the Garlic Knots using Eat24. Food was delivered in 40 minutes, they said 45-60. The pizzas, a Meat Lovers and 2 White Pizzas were actually very good. Overall, we would order their pizza again.

We hosted a group meet here for 11 friends at a birthday celebration. The staff was accommodating and very attentive. All the different dishes we tried were all great. Of course I tried the famous Beef Tips and was impressed, not your average bar fare. This place is great, if you're ever in the South part of town, worth the stop.

Our 8th or 9th time here and the food is consistently very good. My most recent visit I had the Shrimp Scampi Athens style, was outstanding. Wifey had the Pizza with White Sauce and it was great too. Service could be faster, but hey it's a bar. You can't go wrong here, lots of T V's, comfortable seats and great food.

Been to this place twice with wifey and friends. Very busy but always good service. Tonight tried the Ox tail chili fries, was really good. Also went for the Shogun burger which has poached Asian pear amongst other things, was fantastic! This place is worth the visit.

Been here twice. First time was just OK, average taco shop fare. The staff has a hard time with communication in English, but no big deal. Well the second and LAST time, I had to explain 3 times what I wanted. then when it was served, looked and smelled worse. The girl behind the counter was rude. So into the trash the food went and out the door I went.

Found this place on Yelp of course. What a find it is too. Easy parking, fun place as soon as you walk in. Our Server, Cathy was super friendly and made sure to explain the menu choices to us. I went with the Poblano Burger and it was one of the better burgers I've ever had. Wifey had the Mushroom Swiss and loved it. The Sweet Potato Tots are awesome. Our friend got the Hatch Burger and said it was great. We also tried the Frito Chili appetizer, so good. This is a great restaurant and can't wait to return.

We have recently visited 5 different cigar lounges in Scottsdale and this one is the best for our tastes. Easy to find and easy parking. Arrived to find a very well stocked humidor and people working who were awesome. Professional and helpful. Their prices are the best I've seen in the area as well. The lounge is comfortable with lots of TVs. This is our new go-to place when visiting the area.

Have been to several Caps around the valley many times, always a consistent brand. This was my second visit to this location, both times have been sub par. Last night was the same. Actually watched the guy making my Bobby picking and eating meat while making my sandwich. Blah. The overall appearance of the place was nasty and dirty. Will not be returning to this location.

We were next door having dinner and finally had our first cool evening in months. Walked over and were greeted by exceptionally friendly staff. I went into the humidor and not a huge selection, but all the best sellers I'm sure. I picked 3 stogies and we all sat outside and had a wonderful time smoking and listening to the Jazz band. The place is worth the stop.

Tried this place. Pretty cool how they do it like Subway to make your pie to order. We tried a couple different pizzas and to be honest, were much better than I expected. Will for sure be back and will try to be more creative with my options. Worth the visit.

We've been to Matt's several times, but it's actually been a couple of years. Last time was actually pre-Yelp for me.  Anyhow, Matt's has not skipped a beat since our last visit. Once you get seated (there is usually a wait) the service is fast and efficient. When I say fast, I mean we ordered and the food was on the table in less than 5 minutes. I had the Skinny, an egg white scramble with chicken sausage. Damn tasty. Wifey had the stock Bacon and Eggs. Matts bacon is the reason we come here. Excellent. Noisy, busy and crowded...but highly recommend.

Stopped by here on our Scottsdale cigar tour. This is a nice place, huge humidor and an overall upscale vibe to it. Comfortable chairs in the lounge and fair prices. The guy working was knowledgeable on his cigars and very friendly.

Yeah. This place is not good. We arrived, walked in to about 1/3 capacity crowd. We walked around for 10 minutes trying in vain to get anyone's attention. There were 2 servers in deep discussion behind the bar, but they could not be disturbed. Finally I went and stood in the servers station at the bar, the bartender showed up. Says we had to move. I asked him if I gave him money, could he give us drinks since the servers were apparently on strike? We sat had our drinks, waited forever for some crappy fried things, threw cash on the table and split. Not worth the stop.

This location of Geisha House was recommended by friends so we came on a Saturday night. First thing we noticed when we walked in was how beautiful it is. Second thing we noticed was it was very warm in the entire restaurant. Since it was 104 outside, I guess the A/C was working overtime. Was a bit uncomfortable. For appetizers, I had the Blue Fin Tuna, which was fantastic and wifey had the veggie tempura, very well done and crispy. Our friend decided she wanted a martini for an appetizer, she said it was spot on. For mains, I had their 12 piece sushi dinner, everything was fresh, well made and delicious. Wifey stuck with the tempura, the Pork Belly skewers and crispy Won Ton  appetizers. Our friend had the Lamb Lollipops, these were great as well. Overall with the exception of the restaurant being way too warm, was a great evening.

We came in for breakfast at 10 am to find we were the only customers. Not a good sign. Super friendly and fast server...then again, we were the only people there. Wifey tried the Bacon Bloody Mary, great bloody, but the bacon they used tasted old. I tried the Southwest Omelet. Was just a flat griddle omelet folded with green chili's in it, covered with cheese. The hash browns were  very undercooked, devoid of any seasoning at all. Truck stop breakfast.  Wifey had the Bacon and Eggs..gotta be safe with that, right? Not. Eggs OK, Hashbrowns limp and undercooked and no seasoning. Lastly, the Bacon! This was the thinnest sliced bacon we'd ever seen, this was like a joke. In a place called Bacon! Ha! More like a 99 cent strip breakfast. May return to try the burgers sometime, heard those are good but not worth the stop for breakfast.

We were going to be in the area so called and made reservations for a Friday night. Arrived and waited about 10 min, place was hella busy. The service was very good in spite of a full house, the Manager even came over to introduce himself with a handshake, nice touch. The girls ordered drinks and both were tasty. For appetizers we tried the Melted Bree and the Pork Belly with Grits. The Bree was good, the Pork Belly was a Home Run.  Wifey had the Rib Eye Cap and loved it. I tried the Spencer Steak and that was great as well, our friend had the Filet and she loved that too. Overall a great place, with only one complaint, it's just too goddamn loud. I know I'm being a bit old school, and I know it's "trendy" to have a place that looks industrial, but when you have to compete with shouting Waiters and shouting people at the next table all trying to be heard, it's tough to want to return. With 3 cocktails and apps, dinner for 3 came out to $230 with tip. Too much for a place that we could not wait to get out of due to the noise level, other wise would be 5 stars, I guess I'm just not Hip enough.

Have been back twice in the past two months and have had poor experiences each time. It appears Echo and Rig is trying to decide if it wants to be a hip cool bar, or a trendy steakhouse. It's failing at both and we're over it. Made reservations a week ago for 5 people. Even received a confirmation call the day of. Arrived 10 minutes early to an insanely crowded downstairs with blaring music, no where to sit, people drinking and families like us all standing around waiting. Was told they were running late, how late I ask? Here for a birthday. No idea how long the group of 3 giggling 20somthings working the hostess station say. So, I guess we wait...last time we were here the same thing happened so ok. However after 20 minutes, I go ask, how much longer? The group of girls working say no idea, there are "many" people ahead of us. So after 30 minutes and coming to the understanding that Echo and Rig is being run by amateurs who over book their their reservations list consistently, we departed. Twice in a row this is happened here for us, off to find a better run establishment in the area. Shouldn't be too difficult.

We tried this place after a movie. Service was good, fast. Waiter checked on us several times. I tried the Corned Beef / Cabbage special, was pretty good. Wife tried the Caesar Salad, good dressing lettuce was crisp. Son thief the T-Bone and he says it was perfect. So we were a little surprised it was as good as it was. Will go again.

While searching for breakfast in Scottsdale we found this place and turned out great. Kind of a different concept on where you order at the counter and they bring out your meals. I had the  Huevos Rancheros and was great. Wifey had the Breakfast Sandwich. Everything was great, would recommend.

We saw Biscuits had opened here in Summerland and had to try it out. We love it in Phoenix. Came in on a Wednesday at 9am. Place only had 4 tables going so no wait. Waitress was on it and super friendly. Have to comment here on their coffee, hella good. I ordered Breakfast Tacos with Chorizo. Also some Crispy Bacon. This was a great breakfast and the Chorizo is excellent. Wifey ordered Biscuits and Gravy and she says it was damn good.  Overall the place rocks and will return often.

Place is closed. Out of business. Too bad? Looked nice. This area sorely needed a Cigar Lounge. Less then a year the place was open? Oh well.

Tried this place over the weekend and had a great experience. I did not catch her name but a young African American girl served me and she was beyond helpful. Ordered two sandwiches both with special requests and she got everything perfect. This will be our go to place in the NW.

What a great store. Super friendly and helpful guys working.  I needed a battery for an older Jag and they they had one in stock. I also ended up buying all sorts of batteries for other things. They have all your battery needs, from cars to cell phones.

Of all the cigar lounges we visited in the PHX area, this one has the best selection of boutique cigars at the best prices. We stopped in and met Jim who runs the place and enjoyed a couple cigars sitting and visiting. Great cigar shop and great people.

We came here with a group of 7 friends. Service was good considering the place was packed. Several of our group opted for the all you can eat. A couple ordered off the Hibachi menu. The Rolls and Sushi came out fast, the cooked items a bit slower. Good rolls/sushi, fairly typical of all you can eat places. Cooked items we good as well.

Stopped by for a quickie lunch since we were in the area. Very clean and quite big. We were the only customers so was a bit skeptical. But the servers were great and overall a great lunch. I had the Penne Pasta and Wifey got the 12 inch White Pizza. Both were great and would recommend.

We always like hit the B&M cigar lounges/shops when we are in a new town visiting. I really tried with Fox, I wanted to like this place. I spend on the average 200 bucks when I visit a place with a nice selection like Cigar Fox. I alway try anything new I haven't had before. But the staff here, in particular the female bartender with snarky rude comments made me keep my money in my pocket. Paid for the sticks we smoked and left. She must own the place, or is wealthy, because she sure don't care about service. Twice I asked her questions and she acted like I was bothering her each time, then replied with smart ass remarks. So off we go, directly to find another lounge. There are too many nice cigar lounges in the valley that actually have friendly staff and treat customers well.

Happens across this place for lunch. We were immediately impressed by how nice it is once inside. Seated quickly and service was fast. Wifey ordered the Pork Belly and Mushrooms over knife cut noodles. We both loved this. Great flavor. I tried the Beef Noodle Soup. This was just ok. Kinda flavorless and bland. Overall a nice place and we'll probably return.

We came here with our friend who is a true New Mexico Chile Head. The restaurant is decorated really nicely with a N.M. theme that's fun and inviting. Our server told us it was her first night, but she was great. We ordered the appetizer sampler and everything on it was delicious. We all enjoyed the basket of fresh Sopaipilla . I ordered the Stacked Enchilada with Green Chiles. Damn good, very well done. Wifey had the Tacos and they were wonderful too. Great place and recommend.

I've been waiting to try this restaurant for a while now and have been really looking forward to it. Called for Thursday 6pm reservations, was told they have a "wait list" they can add me to, but don't take reservations? Odd, but ok. I immediately received a text saying we've been added. Cool stuff. We arrived and had about a 5 minute wait for out table. The restaurant has a great vibe, nice decorations and you can smell the wood fires. Really liking this place!   Soon after we sat, we realized this place has serious issues. We sat for at least 10 minutes before anyone came to bring water, ask for drinks etc. I saw several servers running like headless chickens. I also saw what I think were 1 perhaps 2 managers strolling around doing nothing like they didn't have a worry in the world.   The menu is great, lots of great choices.  I really wanted to try several items.  We ordered finally and got a pan of great bread dropped on the table. Waited another 5 minutes and finally called someone over so we could get silverware and napkins.  At least something to spread butter with. Things aren't looking good.  Our waiter came finally and took our order. We then sat there for 35 minutes before seeing him again before our dinners arrived. Now we're so agitated it doesn't matter if the food is great or not. We've been here going on an hour still waiting...on a Thursday!   Got our dinners, finished them, waited another 10 minutes, bussed our own dishes, asked for the check and left.   Won't even comment on food as the entire experience was ruined by the total lack of service in what is hoping to be a mid-to high end steak house. Just so disappointed in this place, we really need more choices in the N.W. but Fire Rock will not be around long unless they get their act together.

We came based on Yelp reviews. We arrived and saw there were about 12 people in line, but seemed to be moving fast.  First thing I noticed is the place is LOUD. The entire room is designed with flat noise reflecting surfaces. That plus the big man handing out the pies at the end of the line is screaming people's names at the top of his lungs. Unnecessary loud. The pizza was good, fairly typical of the Chipotle style pick your topping pizza. We will probably not return based on the big guy bellowing names and making everyone else try to yell over him. Too much of a distraction to try and enjoy a meal. Would not recommend unless you like uncomfortably loud restaurants.

Great little place. We stopped by for cookies and mini doughnuts for a gathering of friends. Staff was super friendly and patient as we decided on what to get. The doughnuts were awesome. We got pretty much one of every cookie too. Great prices and great goodies.

Tried this place. The most memorable thing is it's stupid expensive. The burgers are ok, small. The shake I had was decent but small. For 3 of us, we had 3 burgers, 2 shakes, 1 soda and 2 fries. $45.00. Next time just go to In and Out. Better food and cheaper.

Came out to Henderson just to check this place out. Really happy we did too. Soon as you walk in, they make you feel right at home. The humidor is well stocked with quite a few hard to find sticks. The chairs are comfy and great TV's as well. Great lounge and will definitely return.

We were lucky enough to find Maria's while looking for lunch. The place is small, but very clean. The family working could not be friendlier. We of course tried the Fry Bread and Pozole. Was fantastic. I also tried the Green Chili Burrito and excellent. The home made chips were a hit as well. This place is going to be a huge success I hope.
