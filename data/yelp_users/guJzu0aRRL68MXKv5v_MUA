we went for Easter Sunday...had a group of us...family and friends.  Ordered in stages...some appetisers first, then 4 of the entrees...once those came we ordered the rest.  Worked out well.  Service was good, and everyone enjoyed the meal.

This location certainly draws a large lunch crowd.  I was there with my son yesterday at about 12:30 and the place was packed.  The staff seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with everything. For instance, there were about 6 plates...more than we needed.  I did see some setting to the side that had leftover food residue from the last guest sitting to the side...I'm not counting those.  Anyhow, behind my son and I was a group of 6, so we weren't all eating right away!  I have been to this location in the past and there were no napkins at all - they used papertowels from the bathroom.  You pulled off what you needed and went with it.  Yikes!  Where is management when you need them? Food quality was good.  Veggies were fresh, some of the quantities pretty skimpy.  I understand it was lunch time. It seemed there were 2 servers only, and they were hustling. More were certainly needed. Overall, it's a good place to go.  I do enjoy meeting a friend of mine here on an occaisional Sunday afternoon when it's much calmer...altho that's when we had the paper towels issue...but, service is friendly, food is pretty good. Oh...and yesterday, the best soup...Chicken Enchilada Soup...if it's there the day you go...you have to get this!

ordered delivery on a night I was too beat to go out and pick up.  Delivery was at the outer end of when it was expected, but that's fine.  it was all hot and fresh.  enjoyed the meal and I'm sure I'll order again sometime.

Was in there this evening for a quick bite. Normally I go through the drive-through. Tonight I was with a friend and we ate there. Big mistake. Horribly dirty everywhere throughout the dining room. Trash cans were full, The floors were filthy and many of the tables were dirty and sticky.

my first time ever, anywhere to look into meds.  So very friendly and helpful!  I told her I was naive, and really knew nothing about what I was needing.  She walked me thru everything...very patient with this old man, and so sweet!  I highly recommend this place.  Feels very upscale, your grandma would feel ok about this place.  Friends had told me locations they have used are kind of sketchy/scary...for sure not Giving Tree.

stopped in on a Sunday afternoon  the place was jammed!  we were advised the wait would be 30 minutes...maybe up to 45.  It wound up being only about 10!  We sat in the bar...server was fantastic.  Very friendly and attentive.  The food was very good!

I was very impressed with this company.  I gave my son some furniture from my bedroom and dining room.  They were prompt and very careful with everything.  Much easier than my son and I trying to do it on our own!  They were in and out quickly...delivered the furniture to my son's place.  The price was right for sure, and my back was saved! I will be using them again soon. I'm doing a remodel and will get rid of the furniture in the house now, and put it in storage, and then will have them come out again in a couple of months and get it all put back together!
