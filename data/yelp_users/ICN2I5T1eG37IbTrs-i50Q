With 78 reviews, there's not a lot I can in the way of details. I'll just add my 4 star review and say "it's all true"! For non-native tourists -- especially from Chicago -- DBG is a great way to gain an appreciation of just how diverse the desert ecosystems are -- and how fragile.  It was a real bonus to find the Chihuly exhibit here, as well. They say this is th first time they've exhibited this glass outdoors like this.  Don't miss this! Fun seeing the butterflies, too -- especially for the kids!  TIP: Get here early -- it gets warm in the desert! [I probably don't need to tell anyone actually from the Valley that, do I? LOL]

Out of town guest says -- "There have to better places to send us!"  Place was dead today -- I'm guessing this isn't the tourist season. The only place in town where anything was happening was the bar -- where the locals were having a loud conversation about the benefits of viagra.  Truthfully, it was a cool looking bar -- and I'm guessing with the right crowd -- like a chili cook-off or something, it could be fun. But other than that, this is a place full of kitsch...

I'll add my five star review here, too. We're snowbirding down here and had to go by Yelp reviews to find a vet when our Rosie started throwing up. Got an appointment within hours of our call and we were greeted without a hassle when we arrived. Dr. Ciminello was fantastic, actually sitting down near the floor so little Rosie would feel less intimidated. She performed her examination effortlessly and prescribed a simple course of Pepcid AC. Rosie was on her way to welldom in a couple of days. Couldn't be happier! And though they didn't think it was necessary, we went ahead and had the fecal check while we were at it. All in all, no more expensive than a vet visit at home, and if we lived in the area, Doc Ciminello would definitely be on our short list for vets!

Just returned to Richardson's after more than a decade -- really -- the place is just as good as ever. The food is OUTSTANDING. Spices are nicely balanced and there's heat where there should be, and everything is a joy to look at -- as well as eat.  Our waitperson was also GREAT. Very friendly, very laid back, and VERY helpful -- great job on describing the fish dishes, by the way.  We ate TOO much -- guac was great, stickers were tremendous. Chicken Chimayo was really something else. Asparagus, brussels sprouts, green chili potatoes. Chicken stuffed with spinach and asiago cheese -- fantastic!  I had Pasta Heidi -- tons of white meat chicken, nice heat to the pasta, nice creamy sauce. Tremendous!  Even the chicken quesadilla, presented simply on a wooden plate with two sauces, was a treat.  The prickly pear margaritas were also great -- and BIG.  The flan finished off the whole thing. Too much!  We'd be back there tonight if we didn't feel silly being in town for only two nights and eating at the same place both times...

Family-style place, packed on a Tuesday. I wasn't impressed with my order -- asked for "Buffalo Fish Sliders" and instead got 3 small versions of a McDonald's Fish Sandwich - no sign of Buffalo sauce.  Wife got the $12 appetizer sampler. Appeared to us that everything on it -- except for maybe the "chicken strippers" -- was fresh out of the freezer and into the fryer. Not much looked like it was house made.  I liked the strips, but my wife wasn't impressed with those -- she did like the fried zucchini and onion rings.  Beer selection was okay, service was meh. Our waiter spent more time chatting with a woman at a booth than he did checking on his tables. Manager was attentive (thank God) and managed to get the things we needed when we asked.  Not a lot of options here in Maricopa, and I can see how this place would be attractive to families - lots of big tables here. Just not my type of place.

A dusty mess right now due to road construction. Dine outdoors if you are used to a bit of grit with your sandwich. Inside, it's a confusing melange of shelving, buffet lines and beverage stops with a pack of wandering tourists. This would completely baffle my elderly mom. Olive oil is very fresh, and that's a good thing. But the range of flavors borders on silly. For example, the "Bacon Olive Oil" really just has a hint of smoke and saltiness to it.  Everything is expensive here, with most bottles of oil or vinegar at $12+. The load of bread my wife bought was not nearly as fresh as you'd expect in a place with this kind of reputation.  All in all, this placed missed with me on almost every level. Maybe we'll stop back next year and see how it is when the roads aren't all torn up.

Friendliest pub I was in while visiting Scotland. Half of the place is some kind of historical landmark so they literally can't change anything. Very cozy, and warm. Check out all the currency stapled to the ceiling and ask for some history on that. Amazing how much they've taken off the ceiling there and the fact that they are only missing two countries, so they say. They'll even show you a $10 trillion dollar note from Zimbabwe, worth something like 40c.  I recommend the McEwan's, for those with high gravity American tastebuds, but the real ales are all great here. Didn't get into the whiskies because my map app wasn't working and my memory tends to fade with the sunlight... All in all, a lucky find!

Right across the street from my hotel, the Apex, and couldn't have been more perfect. I gorged myself on a bucket of the Scottish Blue Mussels, cooked in a chilli, ginger, lime sauce. Delicious. washed it down with a local ale and absorbed the conversations in 5 languages around me. Lots of Asians eating here, lots of Eastern Europeans, lots of Spaniards. It must be good then, right?  Nice price, efficient service, great place. Recommended!

Hard to find a reservation here on Open Table on the weekend, so Monday was the day. We were there early, too -- 530. Place was empty inside, and outside just a handful of tables. My wife is constantly jabbing me about worrying too much about long waits, so I got more razzing this time. But that would soon change.  We started with the guacamole. It is pricey, but very good. I recommend going with the spicy, but tell them to lay off the salt and the garlic.  For cocktails, my wife got the Blood Orange, i got the Cucumber Jalapeno on the recommendation of our server Canton (sp?). I'm a sucker for cucumber margaritas, and this one did not disappoint. I wanted a pitcher! My wife was not as thrilled with her Blood Orange, but she loves Grand Marnier in her margs. For her second, she went with the house marg and had them add Grand Marnier -- Bingo!  Dinner was outstanding. Simply delicious!  My wife got the braised short ribs. Very good, well-balanced and plenty to take home. We got a side of the street corn and it was also very good, although my one complaint for the night was that the corn was literally swimming in the aioli. I'd recommend a lighter touch on that. I'd also recommend a little more of a toast to the corn. But, seriously, it was STILL really, really good.  I got the Flat Iron Steak, and it was server medium rare. Frickin' delicious! What a great beef taste, and not too chewy -- although, like all flat irons, be sure you are ready for a bit of a fight when you eat this cut of meat. It's not a tenderloin cut. But what a great meat taste. The sauce on top was also delicious.  We took a pass on dessert, although the fried bananas looked very good. I also have to mention that the chips and salsa were a bit disappointing. The chips were generic thin, thin chips and the sauce was a chipotle salsa. Would have loved some house made chips and a fresh pico de gallo.  But those are quibbles. This place ROCKS! And for a couple of people who live almost within walking distance of one of the hottest Mexican places in the Chicago Suburbs, Bien Trucha in Geneva, we have to say this place is a CLOSE second to BT.  We'll be back!

Very nice hotel, feels small, but comfortable. Large lounge/restaurant area, but I didn't have time to check it out. Room was very clean, good shower, clean linens and towels, etc. Extremely cordial at check-in, offered to hold my bags after checkout if I was touring the city.  Highly recommended and very affordable.

Yikes! You better get down here FAST! In a couple of months, they're going to be staging gunfights and stage coach robberies in the parking lot for tourists. This place is headed for ghost town status. The list of stores online made it look like a viable option to driving up into Phoenix for us folks here in Maricopa, but that was just an illusion in the desert heat. Many of the anchor stores are gone, like Best Buy, and other anchors will be gone by the time you read this -- Target is closing on January 30, 2016.  Add in the fact that they spread this place out wider than (former) Minnesota Senator Larry Craig's bathroom stance and you can see why this place is doomed. Someone wrote elsewhere that you literally have to drive around this mall to shop and with all the closings, that's more true than ever. It must cover a square mile!   Ask yourself, how far will you walk just to find out that a store is no longer open?  Exactly.  TIP: Rubio's Coastal Grill is still open. And still serving some great fish tacos. Hurry.

I'll keep it short -- just wanted to add my 4 stars to all the other 4 star reviews. This place serves very good, fresh Mexican food with an emphasis on fish. And the service is top notch! Very clean, well-maintained salsa bar, and fast service. Fish was delicious, as were the corn tortillas they were served in. Even the refried beans were tasty!  This is about the ONLY reason left to visit the Promenade down here, so stop by soon. I have a bad feeling about the amount of business left here... Too bad, they deserve a much better fate!

I liked the place. Almost empty on a Tuesday night, some kind of open mic going on in the dark corner on the other side of the bar. Lots of folks coming in with leather cue stick cases, so I'm guessing this is where the serious pool dudes hang out. Good beer selection (for Maricopa), incredible vodka and whiskey selection. Food was so-so. Catfish was a steal and very good, BLT was delivered on burnt toast.  Friendly staff, I'm guessing this is a great place to hang out after you get off work at the casino. Big room, too. I think they're still working out the details of what they want to be, so I'll give them a thumbs up...

The reviews are all correct, this place is great!   Adequate portions, great prices, very fresh and flavorful food. My wife had the Red Chicken Curry. She's not a hot pepper fanatic like me, so she went with their medium "2". I went with hot "3". I think mine was spot on and even my wife thought she'd go for "3" next time.  I had the Pumpkin Chicken Curry, also tremendous.  We weren't fans of the Chon Thai Rolls. We like the lighter veggie filling of spring rolls.  Overall, very nice and we'll be back!
