I am starting to travel in and out of here quite a bit and unlike most airports it is not entirely unpleasant. It is a large, reasonable attractive, spread out and modern airport. It has easy freeway access and is located fairly centrally in Maricopa County.  The lines at security are shorter than at most other airports I travel to. Terminal 4 has varied and unique shopping and food options, not to mention free WIFI.    Having the car rental building so far from the terminal is a drag particularly having to use the shuttle buses. They are always overcrowded and I always have to wait.  Compared to the vast majority of North American airports PHX is not bad at all.

There are quite a few places that you can hike to to and get a beautiful view but this is by far the best place that you can drive to to take in a spectacular panoramic view of the entire Phoenix basin.   Follow Central Ave. as far south as it goes and then enter the South Mountain park from 5:00 am to 7pm. For those who have never driven a true mountain road the ascent might appear perilous but truthfully it is not terribly difficult. At the summit there is a parking area and a covered shelter.   For hikers, bikers and runners there are many trails accessible from both the Central Ave side as well as the Ahwatukee side.   This is a fabulous place to spend a few hours or to wow some out of town guests.

This store really does have a terrific selection in the way of home goods and I can eventually find what I am looking for when I come here, but with that said, I find their floor to ceiling merchandising kind of off-putting.   I think there has to be a compromise between a shishi poopoo boutique that has  only a few over-priced items in a cavernous space and stores that cram their stores with tons of merchandise to maximize their sales per square foot. Unfortunately BB&B trends towards the latter and it can be kind of overwhelming to find what you are looking for with so much stuff everywhere.   Fortunately this store has a lot of helpful staff to direct you to area that you are looking for and you have to love their omnipresent 20% off coupons. They have even accepted my coupons that expired years prior so even though I dislike their mountainous walls of merchandise I have to say that I am a fan,

Not the biggest Nordstrom Rack that I have ever shopped at but they had some really nice gems buried here and there.   It was a pleasant surprise to find a lot of items that were actually in a Nordstrom store at some point in time rather than the direct to Rack merchandise. I was able to pick up some Tory Burch flats for about 35% off retail and some Jonathan Adler giftware for 60% off.   The store was fairly tidy and the staff were pleasant so I will be back.

Although Orvis doesn't really doesn't have many clothes suitable to wear when the temp is 106 outside, it is my husbands favorite and we make a point to stop in whenever we spot one.  I need to sing the praises of Orvis's wrinkle free long sleeved shirts.  I have fallen prey to the wrinkle free claim by many menswear clothiers and still end up having to take the shirts to the dry cleaner. The Orvis shirt, although not inexpensive at around $100, is truly wrinkle free right out of the dryer. My husband added another shirt to his collection from this store.   This Orvis is smaller than stores that we have visited in other cities but it still manages to contain a lot of the fishing stuff and all of the new Fall styles for both men and women.   Guests of the Westin Kierland  receive a 20% discount off of regularly priced merchandise by showing your room key.

I am not sure what kind of rebranding went on at the corporate level of Restoration Hardware in the last several years, but I am not impressed.    I used to come to RH to find old school, classic designs at what I thought were decent prices. There has since been a massive elevation in the level of pretension without the corresponding elevation in product quality and design. Valet parking at this store, really?? Sofas that are so huge that they would only work in a room the size of a small bungalow? Are you dying to get your hands on a $2K German Light Bulb Voltage Tester bar? Yeah, me neither.   I came in to buy some more of the starry string lights which I am absolutely obsessed with. The three employees on the main floor were so busy kissing the a$$ of just one customer that a couple of us other customers with purchases on our mind were completely ignored. I ended up just leaving after 10 minutes and ordered my stuff online.  Restoration needs to be restored back to the way it was.

Have you ever been to a store where everyone is so friendly and helpful that it kind of freaks you out?  I have probably been to more different Home Depots than most people so I have a pretty good handle on what the typical Home Depot is like. As far as merchandise, layout and cleanliness is concerned this location is a little above average. Where it goes really over the top is in it's customer service. I have been here on three different occasions;  once solo and twice with my husband and on all three occasions every employee went above and beyond to greet us and ask if they can be of assistance. Maybe I am cynical and jaded but after the 4th or 5th employee approaches us and is super friendly I start looking around for a hidden camera. This Home Depot might want to dial it down a notch.

I love designer Jeff Lewis's aesthetic and was thrilled when he came out with his own line of paint. Fortunately or unfortunately the only place that you can purchase it directly from a retail location is at Dunn-Edwards. I haven't had horrible experiences there in the past but this time you would have thought that I had the secret super power of invisibility because I stood there for 10 minutes without any type of acknowledgement. I finally just grabbed a color card and left.

We were doing some remodelling and had to be out of the house for a few days so we checked in here.   First of all, if you are staying in the building that houses the lobby, if you don't want to go through the lobby you must enter a hallway and then run a gauntlet through large luggage trolleys. I can't help but think that there is a fire code violation somehow involved.   If you like king sized beds then you will be disappointed as they only offer up queens. The bed itself was comfortable enough and they handled our request for a feather free room perfectly.   There were a couple of room oddities which detracted from the enjoyability factor. The location of the tv on a little end table in the middle of the room made for awkward viewing from almost every vantage point.  Also,  even if you have a tiny little butt, when you sit on the toilet you will have a toilet roll holder and a roll of toilet paper sticking into your hip. Why they chose to put the tp holder there is truly perplexing.   The rooms were clean and the breakfast better than we expected. The employees that we had contact with were all pleasant and competant. Although I can't see much more need for staying here again, I would not hesitate to recommend it to our friends and family who want to stay close to us without staying with us.

Whether you are on a vacation or a staycation, if you have the opportunity you really should experience this Four Seasons.  From the moment that you exit the car until the second that you check out, the service is impeccable. The casitas are spacious, luxurious and well appointed. The L'Occitane toiletries, the double sinks in the bathroom, the fireplace in the sitting area and the comfortable chaise lounges on the private patio overlooking the fabulous grounds are some of the details which elevate this resort to something special.   Our casita was about an 8-10 minute walk to the lobby and a further 5-10 minute walk from the lobby to the self park area (they have valet parking but I don't like waiting for the car to be brought around - ( I know, major WPP, feel free to eyeroll), but I hardly ever got to experience any complete walks because they have staff running the property constantly in golf carts offering up rides.   If you like the hustle and bustle of town, you might not appreciate the quiet solitude of this resort. For our nightlife on the first night we stood outside our casita and watched an electrical storm off in the distance with Pinnacle Peak as the backdrop. Not everyones idea of excitement but that is how we roll.  Pretty much my only complaint is that the resort limits each room to two complimentary wifi connections before they start up-charging. Between my husband and I we travel with 5 devices requiring wifi so we had to make a Sophie's choice about what to connect. On principle I refuse to pay for something that even Starbucks gives away for free.

I find myself coming here more often than the far closer Scottsdale Fashion Park simply because it is a more manageble size. For people that don't want to make shopping a many hour activity, this shopping center is far less daunting.  I enjoy the Macy's at Biltmore because their sales racks are usually bursting at the seams and when you combine the sales with the discount coupons you can really fill your shopping bags with bargains. I find myself having better luck getting the assistance I need at the Biltmore Apple store versus other locations and the new Jonathan Adler store is one of my go-to's for giftware.   The covered parking is very much appreciated and I personally never seem to have much of a problem finding a spot. The fashion park has a nice ambiance, a nice selection of stores and good options to grab a bite to eat so it is a winner in my book.

Wandering through the rather tacky Old Town Scottsdale was quite a waste of time until i stumbled upon this store. I love Pendleton blankets and the other woollens that they produce. Note to other Old Town merchants: not all western themed goods have to be "made in China" crap.  I ended up picking a gorgeous woollen case for my iPad for not much more than I could have paid for an ugly plastic one at the Apple store. The blankets are fairly expensive but are heirloom quality and in my opinion are worth every cent that they cost.

The omnipresent crowds here speak volumes about the quality of their food.   There is a bit of chaos in the ordering and food delivery process simply because so much of the space is taken up by the tables scattered in amongst the store shelves.   The food is delicious, the portions huge, the prices reasonable.  Just a warning for people that "eat with their eyes" first. My last visit I ordered a chicken philly cheese steak which had to be one of the more revolting looking things that I have eaten in a very long while. The chicken is ground, not in chunks, and when mixed with the mushrooms, cheese, peppers and onions resembles either vomit or dog food. Good thing I have a strong constitution and it tasted nothing like the aforementioned.

We are remodeling our pool and were sent here to look at mini pebble, tile and stone samples.   The showroom is set up in a user friendly manner with large displays all over the walls so we really didn't need a tremendous amount of assistance but the staff were extremely helpful and quick to bring brochures and samples.  The only downside is the limited showroom hours as they close weekdays at 3pm making it difficult to visit for working folks.

A gorgeous mall that skews to the upscale but still with a lot of the mainstream favorites.  We had no difficulty finding parking in the underground lot near Barney's. The mall itself is gorgeous with nice wide aisles but the aisles have been jam packed with a lot of little cart/kiosk things which always cause congestion when the mall is crowded. The mall is also fairly easy to navigate and has good signage throughout however there are a LOT of escalators around and we found ourselves at one point inadvertently one level higher than we thought we were.  The food court is fairly centrally located at the bottom level and is definitely lacklustre. You know, Sbarro and the greasy, msg laden Chinese food et al.  I was expecting a few more options and with a little better quality than that. One plus is that you can surf for indigestion remedies using the mall's free WIFI.  It is not the type of mall that is easy to just run in and out of for a quick purchase but it is a lovely way to spend several hours.

Not the best BBQ I have ever had, but it is pretty darn good.  Because it is not really obvious from the street, we overshot Bobby Q and had to do a turnaround in quite a sketchy strip mall a couple of blocks up. Half expecting a total dive we were pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant itself nicely appointed.  Before we even ordered our food a tasty basket of cornbread was brought to the table. We ordered a sampler plate containing 3 different meats - pulled pork, brisket and St. Louis ribs as well as a BBQ chicken sandwich. We couldn't decide on which sides to select but when our server brought us a sample of the mac & cheese to try our minds got made up in a hurry.  On the sampler plate the St. Louis ribs were terrific, the pulled pork was not too bad but the brisket was kind of dry. Fortunately the server had brought large containers of 2 types of BBQ sauce to our table so we were able to moisten the brisket with the sauce. The chicken on the sandwich was moist but I found the sauce a little too mild and sweet.  The service we received was friendly and attentive and the little doughnuts in the to-go bag was a nice touch.  Overall, worth a repeat visit if we are in the area. 3.5 stars.

I am all about working the system by combining coupons with sales, and from September to December my "Thanks for Sharing" rebate to get the very best deals at Macy's. This Macy's provided me some of the best deals I have obtained in a long time. How does a $94 Ralph Lauren blouse for $5 and change work for you?!   The store appeared very clean, well organized and had overflowing sales racks that contained a lot of quality pieces.   I had to make a effort to find a cash register that had a Macy's employee manning it and there was a rather large area on the main floor under construction, thus the one star deduction.

I have been to In-N-Out many many times and I am rarely disappointed but on this particular visit at this particular location I have to say LAY OFF OF THE SALT SHAKER.   Both my husband and I had the same complaint about over-saltiness and we pinpointed the source of the salt to either the bun or the onions surprisingly enough. We both managed to scarf down every morsel of food on our trays but the excessive salt was a bit of a food buzz-kill.

You can't complain about service when you are the only customers in the store and you have 2 sales clerks helping you out!   My husband works out a lot so we come to Big 5 semi-annually to buy him some new running shoes. He likes the brand Saucony and Big 5 usually has a decent selection at good prices. I suspect that most are discontinued models, thus the terrific prices, but at the end of the day who cares if they are from the Spring 2014 collection?   My only beef about the store is how crowded it is. They manage to cram more merchandise in a medium size store than you would find in a store twice the size. The aisles are narrow and to get from one end of the store to the other is akin to running the gauntlet. I guess it is worth it though to get $110 running shoes for $50.

For a mere $2 admission some of the things I saw: Sheep and goats dressed in Halloween costumes 4H kids showing the calves they raised themselves Some beautiful quilts More tattoos than I have collectively seen in one place, including 2 full head tattoos! The pages of "People of Walmart" come to life. Guys hawking luchador masks, engraved wooden signs and other crappity crap.  Deep fried everything and anything.  The games, rides and food are very expensive but my bag was not checked when i came in so I imagine you can bring your own much more palatable food or drink if you so desired.  For those expecting Disneyland you will be sorely disappointed but for those with reasonable expectations it is a fantastic way to spend a few hours.

We were craving BBQ but were too lazy to make our way to Bobby Q. MAJOR MISTAKE.   The brisket and the ribs were adequate but the portion sizes for the meats were small. The chicken and turkey both looked and tasted processed. The side dishes were uninspired, with the mac and cheese being mushy and tasting like it came out of a box. The area around the beverages and BBQ sauces was absolutely filthy and all the cutlery had to be wiped down before we could use it.  Adding insult to injury, no one told us that there was complimentary ice cream for customers- we discovered that as we were leaving (for the first and last time I might add)!

Our first visit to this Habanero's location, in a strip mall near the Scottsdale Gun Club.  We opted to go with the table service although you can also choose to order at the counter fast-food style. Our server was friendly, helpful and attentive.   You pay $1.29 for a basket of chips and 3 salsas which is a reasonable price for the quantity you receive, but they are just room temperature chips from a bag and the salsas, although very tasty, were extremely thin in consistency. We didn't eat a whole lot of them because it was like dipping chips in bowls of soup broth.  The carnitas burrito and chicken fajita burrito that we ordered were outstanding. They were a fairly large size, piping hot, loaded with a generous portion of really flavorful, moist meat. We would not hesitate to order either one of those again.   Overall, a really pleasant experience!

There is a certain standard of excellence that I expect with the Westin chain and for the most part the Kierland Villas delivered to this standard.  The staff was friendly and accommodating, the suites beautifully appointed, the grounds were well manicured and included a couple of swimming pools, there was a well equipped gym and business center and a lovely lobby. The Villas are in very close proximity to the Westin Kierland Resort, the Kierland Common shopping area and the Kierland golf club.  What the Villas lacked was what the adjacent Westin Kierland Resort has: a spa, shopping and dining options.  Guests of the Villas have full privileges at the Resort but getting there is a 10 minute walk (at 106 degrees, not fun) or waiting for a shuttle to take you back and forth (again, not fun).  The argument that we have a full kitchen in our villas so we don't need a restaurant might be true if most people actually wanted to cook while they are on vacation. Really, who does that?  There was a deli on site but it didn't cut it for dinner time.  Overall, a lovely experience.

I love froyo and this is my favorite place. I am comforted by the fact that the dispensing machines and the toppings have not been man-handled by the general public. They also offer samples for the asking since the flavors get changed up regularly. I have been saved from potential disaster by the samples - I am talking about you Cinnamon Bun!   Although they have a huge selection of interesting nonfat selections my 2 favorite flavors are lowfat salted caramel and lowfat peanut butter. They taste every bit as rich and creamy as their full fat counterparts.   When you pick a medium ($4)  or large ($5) size cup you can choose up to 4 flavors to have. The toppings run either .55 or .95 per topping.

My 7 year old niece loves this store and asks for clothing and accessories from here on all gift giving occasions. Being the loving Aunt, I am happy to oblige. I am not sure what the allure is, but I think I have figured it out....it appeals to 7 year olds because most of the stuff is probably made by 7 year old Chinese kids in a sweat shop in Dongguan or the like.  Although the clothes are cute and trendy, the quality is quite poor and will only last the season that they are trendy or until the kid grows, which ever comes first.   I am not sure if the sales clerks are poor at tidying the merchandise or if most the customers are a slovenly lot, or a combination of both, but it would be nice to have a cleaner, better organized store.   Overall, most of the merchandise is crappity-crap, but children love this place so what are you going to do?

An entire huge store dedicated to all things golf.  From the essentials like clubs, shoes and bags to every useful (useless?) accessory that one doesn't need but feels compelled to buy, this store has it all.  I didn't see many really terrific deals but the convenience of having everything you need under one roof is pretty good incentive to spend your dough here.

Nathan was punctual, professional and very reasonably priced.  We had our new house completely re-keyed. In 40 minutes all of the locks were re-keyed, the locks were locking and unlocking better than before and duplicate keys made. I would not hesitate to use United Lock Service again.

I dislike the PV Mall and try to avoid it as much as possible but I was on a hunt for a specific pair of Dockers trousers for my husband that I couldn't find at Macy's so I ended up here.   I interrupted a couple of chatting teenaged sales clerks to find out that Menswear was upstairs. When I located the escalator it was fenced off and out of order so I had to find either the stairs or the elevator. I found out later that the escalator had already been out of order for a couple of weeks!   The sales guy that attempted to help me was very sweet but he must come to work on a short bus. I told him the style I needed - a 36 waist and 34 inseam. He must have brought me about 6 different pairs , none of which were 36-34. I literally had to ask him if he knew that 38 was not the same as 36!  I finally found the proper pair myself, and they were on sale, so Penney's earned a purchase and a 2nd star.   I will not be returning voluntarily.

I don't quite understand the complaining about this branch of the post office. I have found all of the employees to be polite and professional and the lines aren't unnecessarily slow.   I went in today to mail a package and there was a fairly long line, not surprising given the time of year. There were 4 windows open and the line moved along quite nicely. I found the lobby to be clean and well stocked with all of the forms and there were also pens scattered everywhere as well.   In and out in 10 minutes.

Whoever came up with the idea of pay by the oz. yogurt bars is an evil genius. I mean give the customer a one-size-fits-all cup the size of a bucket so that even if they only half fill it up it is going to cost $6! And then put cheap, but really heavy items as toppings and charge $0.45/oz. Do people know they are paying $7.20 a pound for gummy bears?   With that said, Yogurtology has quite good frozen yogurt.  Unlike many of its competitors its yogurt is not icy and watery but is actually quite creamy and rich. Their in-house mixed flavors: oatmeal cookie and graham cracker, are unique and oh so good. They had between 50-60 toppings to choose from as well.  Unlike some other yogurt joints that allow self administrated sampling, Yogurtology requires that an employee fill the little paper cups for you which definitely makes it awkward to then try more than one or two samples. Choose wisely!

My espresso was burnt tasting and bitter. I think they extracted at too high a temperature? My husband's Americano was okay though.   I do like the style of cups they use because you don't need a sleeve when the drinks are very hot.

I wasn't in the market for a new bra but a beautiful bra and panty set in the window caught my eye and drew me in. They have a really nice variety of undergarments from the utilitarian to little pretty lacy things in sizes that extend into the Carol Doda range (how's that for an old timey SF reference??).  I have been properly bra fitted in the past so I was confident in my ability to pick out my own size. The sales clerk might have been a little too insistent in checking to make sure that I had selected the proper size even after I had insured her that I was  competent to select my own. She came into my change room to check and just ended up confirming that I had made the proper selection.   Soma is a sister company to Chico's and White House/Black Market with similiar quality and price points. They have a free membership/purchase program that offers discounts and special sales. I will definitely return the next time that I am in the market for new lingerie.

If you don't like garlic or spicy heat then this is not the place for you.   Upon reading some of my my fellow Yelpers reviews, I see that slow, disorganized service has been a sore point for them. Our experience was the complete opposite. We were warmly greeted, seated immediately, had our order taken promptly, our food arrived from the kitchen quickly and our severs were very attentive.  The complimentary chips were served with a green and a red salsa. Both salsas were zippy, but not excessively so, with nice balanced flavors. We ended up going through two bowls of each because I smothered my burrito with salsa, yum! The only downside was that the chips were pretty and multi-colored but right out of a bag. Give me monochromatic chips right from your fryer and you will have a friend for life!  We all ordered burritos (burros in AZ?). I selected the plain chicken one which was fabulous. The chicken had been stewed until it almost melted like butter in my mouth.  I had a close encounter with a whole clove of garlic and a small bone but successfully avoided a crisis with each of them.   The portion sizes are humongous! My husband and I could have easily shared one plate and still left very full. Even our ice teas were served in what looked like 40oz glasses!   We are looking forward to returning to try their adovada ribs. If they do something about the tortilla chips and watch the bones Los Dos Molinos will earn 5 stars from me.

I got a 2 for 1 coupon from the concierge at Fashion Square so we thought that we would grab a cup of their tasty fro-yo.    I had had some of the Oatmeal Cookie at a different location a few days earlier and wanted a repeat performance but decided to change it up with Peanut Butter as my second flavor. Loads of topping options but I selected a little toasted coconut for the Oatmeal Cookie side and crushed peanuts for the Peanut Butter side. Definitely a winning combination! There are complimentary sauces at the cash register for you to use too (hot fudge, caramel and salted caramel) if you are so inclined.  When I presented my coupon they looked like they had never seen one before despite the fact that the concierge is literally right outside their front door no more than 25 feet away. After a little convincing that I don't manufacture bogus coupons to scam fro-yo shops they accepted the coupon and we went on our merry way.

I love breakfast and will eat it three times a day if I have the chance. I also love being able to walk to a restaurant so if I stuff my piehole full of food I can bask in the delusion that that little bit of exercise will burn the food off. The Egg I Am offers breakfast deliciousness (until mid-afternoon) and within walking distance!  My husband and I are creatures of habit and once we find a good thing we rarely deviate on the menu. My husband is a Benedict man and I have never been disappointed with the build-your-own omelette. I really like that they offer turkey sausage for those of us that don't eat a lot of mammals.   I will keep coming back as long as they are there.

This is the nicest El Pollo Loco that I have eaten at in AZ.  As much as I find El Pollo Loco's secret marinade so addicting, I was taking a hiatus from it because I had hit a bad run of dry chicken and super small pieces at other locations. I also thought I had to sacrifice cleanliness in order to get my chicken fix because almost every El Pollo Loco that I have been in recently has been slightly grimy with a thin layer of chicken grease on almost every surface and a messy salsa bar. Not this one! Light, bright, spacious and clean - shocking.   Two piece meal with rice, salad and flour tortillas - perfection.

The club in terminal 4 is closed for remodelling so we had to walk quite a distance to get to the other club in an adjacent terminal, and I can truly say it was not worth the walk.  I am always amused by the level of "screening" one needs to go through to get into the joint. First having to be buzzed in and then having to successfully go through the gauntlet that the ladies at the front desk put you through. We saw quite a few travelers turned away because they did not have the correct credentials. Based on this level of scrutiny it should be WAY nicer than it is.  The club is quite small with limited seating and there are a limited number of electrical outlets. The wifi is pretty fast,  but it is also free throughout the airport so that is not too much of a benefit. The food is limited to small bags of chips, some trail mix and packaged biscuits as well as 1oz packages of cheese which are kept under the watchful eye of the bartender. Most of the magazines are quite random (eg. a magazine dedicated to swimming pools) and not terribly exciting. The bathrooms are actually less fancy than the ones out in the terminal.  U.S. Air could learn a thing or two about hospitality from their international counterparts.

We came expecting a slightly more formal restaurant, but this casual set up worked for us too. They have a bar area that had more patrons at it then were sitting at the tables for food.   They did not have to twist our arm to get us to try their margarita drink special. The margaritas were pretty average but they were cheap so that is a win in my book!  The drinks worked well with the basket of chips and 3 salsas which were delivered to the table. One of the salsas was ridiculously mild, but the green and hotter red (habanero) were tasty. Our server did a great job keeping us topped off with the two salsas that we liked.   We ordered the lobster enchiladas and the parilladas. The lobster enchilada was not overflowing with lobster but there was enough there to let it be known that it was  present. This was my first time having parilladas, which is essentially a mixed meat fajita with pan fries thrown in for good measure. Not a huge fan of the potato addition so I will opt for straight up fajitas in the future.   Definitely a great choice for good food in an elevated fast food setting.

I was under the impression that you had to be a senior to use this facility. I popped in to inquire about some activities for my parents and was surprised to learn that it is a City of Scottsdale facility that anyone over the age of 18 can use.  The vast majority of the people who frequent the building are seniors but if you aren't an ageist and like to play billiards or cards, want to dance, take a computer course, take an art course, use the small, well equipped gym, learn a foreign language or use the small library this might be the place to go to. The building is light and bright and very inviting.  I can't say that I will be rushing to use the Via Linda Senior Center personally any time soon but if I have a hankering to play some mahjong or canasta I know where to come.

I love the fact that it doesn't seem weird that there is an auto showroom next to the Sunglass Hut in the Fashion Square Mall and that the car salesmen look more like they belong at the Genius Bar at the Apple Store than in an auto showroom.  There is a $122K Model S sitting in the showroom for you to sit in (gorgeous, tons of leg room but limited headroom) but if you want to test drive it you need to get your name on a list. Tesla brings cars in once a quarter for all licensed, interested parties to test drive.   The store is entirely green with absolutely no printed materials. The car ordering process itself is all electronic. The product specialist, Braddon Deak, with who we were talking was awesome and had an encyclopedic knowledge of all things Tesla.  Even if you can't afford the car, they have tons of Tesla related merch to tide you over until you build the bank account.

The only thing that this Los Dos Molinos has in common with the Los Dos Molinos in Ahwatukee is the name.   The decor in this location is far more upscale - like a day at the ranch meets Dia de Muertos. We sat at a nice table in the back and immediately received a basket of fresh chips with green and red "holy f#%k that is hot" salsa. The other location served us bag chips but with a lot more palatable salsa.  To make a direct comparison between locations I ordered the exact same thing, a chicken burro with a side of rice. The difference was huge, literally. The burro I received in Ahwatukee was the size of a swaddled baby whereas this one was at a minimum half the size. It was still a big enough portion for a typical adult, but I sure didn't need a doggy bag. My rice on the side was over cooked and crunchy. Because the salsa was so unnecessarily hot I did not want to use it on my food even though it kind of needed it. My husband's adovada ribs were delicious but he did not receive too much meat on his plate. We ended the meal with some sopapillas which were quite tasty.   Service was extraordinarily attentive at times but then we went through periods of being ignored. I am not sure that this place is worth a revisit. 2.5 stars.

Wow, Mexican food as good as I get in Vancouver.....  I have been trying to get my fill on Mexican food while here in AZ and got drawn in to Cafe Rio by their fresh homemade tortilla sign. It is kind of sad when the tortilla is the highlight of the meal.   I ordered the Maria Enchilada with medium salsa and had pico de gallo on the side. It was so devoid of flavor, spice or heat that I would consider it the equivalent of Mexican baby food. There are so many other better places to go.

Looking down the row of dining options in Terminal 4, Blanco looked like our best choice. We were able to secure a table immediately and our waitress was quick to take our order. It wasn't a problem that we only wanted to order chips and salsa and to split a burrito.   The chips and salsa came almost immediately and were everything that they should be - homemade, fresh with a nice zippy salsa. The burrito had a generous portion of chicken with a really nice flavor. The rice tasted like it was made with a lot of butter, good or bad depending how much you like butter.   We are used to overpriced and less than delicious airport food so Blanco was an unexpected and delightful surprise.

This is a spacious, clean and  well organized Nordstrom Rack.  There are many bargains to be had although a lot of the merchandise looks like it is direct to the Rack instead of merchandise that arrived via the Nordstrom stores.   The entire back portion of the store is shoes and unlike some Racks which only have one shoe out and you have to go and ask a clerk for the mate, this Rack has both shoes out. Some of the discounts were not as deep as I would have liked on the higher end labels, but they were still a bargain.

I liked this festival but then again I did a lot of things right to insure that we would like the festival.   1. I pre-bought our tickets to avoid the hour+ lineup for tickets. 2. We brought water to drink for the long walk from our car to the entrance. Unfortunately the parking attendants made us park in a spot that was closer to Target on Indian Bend then to the gate. The parking was free so that certainly was a plus and the security let us carry in our water. 3. We arrived between 12-1. As it was, Gallo Blanco had already run out of their chicken tacos in the early afternoon. 4. I printed out last years list of winners so we had a target of several booths that we wanted to go try. There are so many booths yet only so much stomach capacity! My favorites this year, Mission, Gallo Blanco & Gadzooks, had been winners from 2013. 5. We brought enough money to buy enough tokens so we could get everything that we wanted. Tacos =$2=1 token and Beer/Margharitas =$6=3 token.   The luchador "show" was so sleazy and campy that I had to love it but what wasn't so fabulous was their use of profanity. I swear like a longshoreman but never in front of children. Some rocket scientist on the "American" wrestling team was calling members of the audience motherf#%*ers. Yup, in front of a bunch of kids.   I was a little disappointed to not see very many fish/seafood offerings. And I was pleasantly surprised to see as much seating in the shade as I did.   Overall a really fun and delicious event.

Can you put a price on a breathtaking view? Apparently you can and it is $30 for an omelette and an ice tea. With that said though, it was a fabulous omelette, the restaurant is in the middle of the Four Seasons Resort and the view from the patio could be used by the Chamber of Commerce to inspire people to come visit Scottsdale or at least remind people who live here that our chosen home is spectacularly beautiful.  Seriously, the omelette was among the best that I have ever had. The eggs were fluffy and every bite was chock full of all of the goodies that I got to select from on their extensive list of choices. The hash brown side dish was not bad but what set it into the stratosphere was the tomato-bacon "jam" on top of it. I could eat the jam by the spoonful.  The inside of the restaurant is a faux haute western theme, "authentic" right down to the leather smell that they must pipe in. Makes you want to saunter up to the bar and order a sarsaparilla (wearing $300 jeans).

Portillo's Hot Dogs looks like the love child between a 50's Diner and the Las Vegas Strip.  I don't even like hot dogs but the throngs of people flowing through the doors at noon piqued our curiosity. After some initial disorientation due to the over abundance of signage, we located a paper menu and were pleasantly surprised that most of the menu items were not hotdogs.   I ordered a broiled chicken sandwich and my husband  chose the Italian roast beef sandwich.  My sandwich was fabulous! The bun was super fresh and there was a moist real chicken breast with some lettuce and tomato on it. The Italian sandwich was loaded with meat which had been soaked in a flavourful au jus. The $5 prices seemed like a bargain for them.   The sides of fries and onion rings  were nothing special but the apple walnut chicken salad and the chocolate malt are on my list for our next visit.   Interestingly many of the employees seem to be a couple of generations older than your typical fast food kind of place and they are super friendly and efficient .

A brand spanking new grocery store with a tavern inside that has 36 different beers on tap. Could a grocery store be better than this?  I think not.

I am pizza traditionalist - to me,  a fired Neapolitan style pizza Margherita is perfect. My husband on the other hand has been known to build pizzas that cost as much as a restaurant filet mignon because of all of the add-on toppings costs that most pizza joints charge.   Because of my husband's proclivity for loaded pizzas, I love Fired Pie. For a very reasonable flat charge they can build you the delicious pizza of your dreams in salad bar fashion. They have enough variety of sauces, cheeses, meats, vegetables & herbs to satisfy everyone. The crusts are nice and thin and the pizza oven is blistering hot so the pizzas get turned out fairly quickly with the perfect balance of crispiness and chew.   They also build custom salads for the same $7.95 flat price but I have yet to partake. I love Fired Pie.

I have been a customer of Warby Parker for several years, long before they offered progressives and had many storefronts. The downside use to be that you made your selections based on photos and a description from the website and if you wanted to be extra cautious, you would take them up on their offer to send you up to 5 pairs for a trial at home. Definitely a hit or miss proposition!   I got lucky with the 3 pairs of glasses I have ordered from them online, but I got spoiled in NYC last year visiting their flagship store and getting to try on all of the frames. They update their product line regularly and I am thrilled that they have a presence right in Scottsdale so I can check them out and try them on.   This store is chic and fits in well with the other stores in the Quarter, so one would think that the prices would be high. Wrong! A pair of glasses with prescriptions start at $95! Cheap enough to buy multiple pairs to coordinate with your wardrobe.   The store help is friendly and will assist you with your selections if you need it.
