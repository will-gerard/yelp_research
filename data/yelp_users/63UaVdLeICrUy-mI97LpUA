Comedor Guadalajara es muy delicioso!  Me encanta enchiladas!  Their enchiladas were good.  I got plain red cheese, and they did not disappoint.  I was more impressed by the menudo....mmmmm!  Great place, and its HUGE inside!

Their sandwiches are delicious.  I like the Camelback location much better as it offers meat and cheese plates in addition to their sandwiches.  The Central location is very fast paced.  Order ahead if at all possible.  This is a little on the pricey side, but the ingredients are very high quality.

I went with a party of four, and was the only one not to order the chicken fried steak - - rather, my heart was set on chicken fried chicken.  Now, I'm not a gravy person, so I ordered my chicken w/o gravy.  This was the most flavorless piece of fried chicken I've ever eaten.  The breading had ZERO seasoning in it, and the chicken was not seasoned.  While it was moist, it required generous amounts of tabasco to make it edible.  What a let down.  The buttermilk biscuit was good...and that was all I'd describe as above average.

i LOVE CHEBA HUT!  Beyond crave worthy.  Something about the garlic bread, pickles, and "special herbs."  It is a really relaxed place, and I try to go as often as possible.

Great food! I always order cheese enchiladas with the spicy green sauce.  You can't go wrong with them.  Beware of the salsa quartet...it's addicting! I honestly can't pick a favorite. I'm tempted to order extra cinnamon sugar sopapillas at the end of the meal!

LOVE Teakwoods!  If you like wings, try the el jefe wings.  I get them with hot buffalo sauce instead of the mild, and I get them re-dipped after they're been grilled.  YUM! Their burgers are good too--I always get the patty melt. Delicious.  The vibe is relaxed, and it is a great place to hang out with friends.  Make sure to check out the daily menu--there is always something new!

J'adore Liberty Market.  For breakfast, you have to try the smoked salmon plate.  Lunch, try the caprese sandwich.  The bread is a little too toasty, and can irritate the roof of my mouth..otherwise, it is so good!  For dinner, try the special.  For a snack, try a scone and the ca phe.  If you have a chance to attend a community dinner, DO IT!  They are so good and a great value.  Support local restaurants!

I cannot live without Lo-Lo's.  It is INSANE.  Juicy, juicy chicken, crispy waffles....mind blowing.  I alternate between the Betty Boop and the Tre Tre.  I actually prefer their dark meat as I find it tastier.  Either way though, you can't go wrong.  Skip the Scottsdale location and go to the OG place on Yuma.  Oh..and get the sweet tea! Tooth rot in a jar, but so good!

Quality beef, knowledgeable staff, great prices!  Midwest Meats is an excellent place to buy all your meat products.  If you want a special cut, just call ahead.  They're very accommodating to your needs.  Don't forget to try the baked goods from the adjoining bakery--stunning array of pastries!  If you want a damn good hamburger, get some freshly ground sirloin, peppered bacon, and some of their freshly baked buns. YUM!

I love Sushi Kee!  Make sure to ask for the fresh wasabi...you'll never go back to the green paste again.  The murphy roll is a classic...hot, bubbly, cheesy...a surprising roll.  The Red Mountain roll is huge--spicy, and a meal all by its self.  Their sashimi is great.  The octopus sashimi is my favorite!  It is served with paper thin slices of lemon which are the perfect compliment to the octopus.  The Hawaiian roll was amazing! It has a sweet kiwi sauce that is insanely good.  Whether you do rolls or sashimi, you can't go wrong at Sushi Kee.

If the Diavola pizza wasn't good, I would have only left 1 star. I arrived with my dinner guest for a Friday night dinner at 8:15p.  It took the server 5-10 minutes to acknowledge us, and she was unprofessional and awkward. Instead of a hello, or welcome, I was greeted with "do you want to order, or can I get you drinks"? When we ordered our pizza, and she continued to suggest that we order a salad because the pizza would take awhile, I should have known I'd be in for a long night. By the time our order was placed, it was 8:25.  Our appetizer (aglio olio-standard, not awesome) came in a timely fashion. After eating the bread, drinking my drink, and thinking to myself "huh, its been a while"...I glanced at the time. It was 9:10.  I proceeded to watch a man at another table raise his hand for service, and hold it up for nearly 3m. It was 9:30 by the time my pizza came. An hour to bring out a pizza is outrageous. You only have one opportunity to make a first impression Classic Italian, and you lost me as a customer.

I wouldn't even bother trying to go for dinner.  It is all about lunch here.  I've tried every pizza and love them all.  There is a special place in my heart for the wiseguy and the margherita plus proscuitto.  YUMMY!  Their bread is insane.  I could do with a better drink selection, but that is a minor quibble.

Got the caprese (can't go wrong)...so good!  The bread was divine.  Great tomato to cheese to basil ratio.  (very important!).  Slightly disappointed they didn't serve pizza over lunch...can't wait to try the pizza.

Yummy food. TERRIBLE time/order management. Came to dinner on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend, and it took longer than usual to get our order. Not a big deal since we were enjoying a night out together. But today, I called in an order at 6:50, was told 25-30 min to pick up, so when I arrived at 7:15, I was told it would be another 20 minutes! Unacceptable!

They're not reinventing the wheel here--simple sandwiches and sides for a reasonable price.  Service was adequate, and the place was quiet on a Saturday afternoon.  I had a blt, it was meaty, but the bacon was thin and you could tell it was either reheated or kept under a heat lamp.  I asked for potato salad as a side ($1 extra), and it tasted like the stuff you buy from your grocery store deli.  It's decent, but I would be unlikely to seek it out.

This is a great little old school chinese restaurant.  They have pink linens, fake flowers, etc...it feels like a 1980s NY style chinese restaurant.  Aside from the decor, the food is good.  I enjoy their hot and sour soup, yum!  They are affordable and the portions are a good size.

My favorite bagel shop!  They have a great selection of bagels--my favorite is the cheddar.  But where they really shine is with their spreads.  Every spread I have tried has been outstanding.  They are chunky and you can tell the ingredients are fresh.  I hate spreads that puree the ingredients and you can't tell they're there.  Here, the veggies in the garden spread are thick cut and identifiable.  The tops is jalapeno spread!  Yum!

Borderline average sushi.  This is a place to see and be seen, but not a serious sushi destination.  Ra is for the status conscious, and I don't quite understand why as it is not particularly trendy, fancy or special.

Nom nom nom!  The honey blue cheese is insane.  I usually get my sweet republic fix at whole foods, but that pales in comparison to the ice cream served straight from the source.  The texture of their ice cream is akin to gelato--very smooth mouth feel.  In addition to the honey blue cheese, the jalapeno avocado is great too!  Basil lime is a great fall back, and the honey flavor is great as well.  My boyfriend hated the rose flavor--said it tasted like soap.  Despite his resistance, I enjoyed it, and could not recommend this place enough!

Very cool little restaurant.  I imagine it would be very easy to drive right past this place...no sign!  I ordered the grilled baguette, lobstah mac and cheese, and the daily special: fish and chips.  My boyfriend and I shared each plate. Everything was delicious!  The olive oil served with the baguette was so delicious--complex and grassy.  The lobstah mac and cheese definitely delivered on the lobstah! The fish and chips was a nice surprise; tender, moist cod and thick-cut chips.  We were there during happy hour, and I ordered the Sunbru michelada...I can't believe this drink got me to enjoy beer! I never drink beer!  In all, this was a great place!!

I love this place!!  As other reviewers have pointed out, the salsa bar is insane.  Do yourself a favor and sample each variety.  They're not labeled to indicate how spicy they are, so be forewarned.  The cochinita, gaucho, dogfish, and shrimp tacos are my favorite.

Ah-may-zing.  Oysters? Check.  Bloody marys? Check.  Spiciest shrimp boil ever? Check!!! Depending on the chef, a shrimp boil ordered at level 10/10 on the heat scale truly delivers. I'm a huge chile head; very few dishes deliver that spice I crave. But when I found myself sweating, nose running and mouth ablaze, I knew I was in heaven. The chef told us they use cayenne, habanero and ghost peppers to achieve the level 10. It was nirvana. On top of being spicy, it is actually very flavorful.  Two thumbs up.

Three words: Shrimp del Sol.  I LOVE this salad.  So fresh, healthy and good!  The dressing is citrusy and spicy, while being light and not overbearing.  The chipotle pita cheese crisps are to die for and are the perfect compliment to the salad.  Highly recommended!

I took my boyfriend here for a special night out, and we were both in heaven.  Everything we ate was utterly mind blowing.  I appreciated that I was trying japanese dishes that haven't been replicated at every restaurant in town.  The location of the restaurant is serene and the perfect compliment to the cuisine.  I cannot wait to go again!

Munch munch munch! So good!  It is very exciting to have a good Thai restaurant in NE Mesa!  Their Tom Yum is delicious, I love the delicate broth and button mushrooms.  I order my dishes Thai hot, and while it isn't mouth searing like some other places, it is still spicy.  The beef salad was a surprise winner.  The beef was tender and succulent, and the lime dressing was out of this world!  Skip the crab puffs though...very little filling-to-wrapper ratio.

Average.  Not the best, not the worst.  I can't honestly remember any spectacular about what I ate.  I had their "famous" chicken pizza, and it was nothing to write home about.  Our server suggested the wings as they were "amazing"..and they weren't.  Shocker.  I will likely not return.

Delicious food.  If you are opting out of wine, try the cucumber honey lemonade.  It is so crisp and refreshing!  You cannot go wrong with the bruschetta--my favorite is the roasted pepper and goat cheese.  I could have done without the toddlers on either side of us, but hey, when in Gilbert.
