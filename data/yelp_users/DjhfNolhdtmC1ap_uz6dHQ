The first time my fiance and I went with his sister in law for coffee. The coffee was great and it had a cool feel to just sit and chat. My fiance had grown up on the west side and new coffee shops like this weren't easy to find. So we went back thinking it was our best option besides the local Starbucks (we love local coffee shops so this is our last resort). We ordered two lattes and we're incredibly disappointed with what we got. I don't know much about coffee compared to my fiance, whose a barista, but I knew the color was not the right color for a latte and it tasted like watered down coffee with low fat milk (and we did double check that they were vanilla lattes when we picked them up). We were incredibly disappointed with the fact they served us something that was so below par just from the look of it.

I loved loved loved Lillian Lotti! I made an appointment to just try on with no expectation of buying through them but was pleasantly surprised to find the dress! They told me the dress I was looking at wasn't in stock for me to try on and picked me out similar styles; but when I was there one of the girls ran out with it in her hands because they had just unboxed it and remembered me looking at that one. I ended up going with a different one though. Hanna the girl helping me was so sweet!! And an excellent clamper (she made every dress look amazing on me it was so hard to pick). She was incredibly accommodating and affirmed any decision I made about a dress.

About a year ago I dropped my phone and the screen cracked. Within an hour and $60 bucks later it was like brand new. From checking other stores pricing, they were the best price (especially take advantage of the $10 for $20 deal on Yelp).   Recently my fiance's battery was dying within in minutes and he gave them a call. They fixed the battery within a few minutes and it was only $30 compared to Apple telling him $80 and it would take an hour. Unfortunately they couldn't salvage his water damaged Mac but they spent a lot of time talking through the options he had and what would make the most sense in relation to cost.

When my fiance and I started planning our wedding I told him the most important part to me were the photos and he showed me Scott's blog. He had met Scott previously and knew he had wanted to work with him someday. Scott's photos are beautiful and you can tell the love he has for his work. Rather then your normal posed engagement  shoots, Scott does beloved sessions. Prior to our engagement shoot we filled out a questionnaire about our partner and picked out a couple sweet things (exchange love letters, make a promise to the other, and share a song that reminds you of the other) from a list to do during our shoot. At first we were uncomfortable with the thought of sharing intimate thoughts in front of someone but Scott immediately put us at ease and everything flowed so well. Scott has an amazing personality and we cannot wait for him to do our wedding photos in March.

Adore Bridal is an incredibly cute little boutique. It is a consignment dress shop so it doesn't have a large selection but there is a wide variety of different styles. Decy is incredibly sweet and spent hours helping me try on dress after dress. I didn't find my dress here (given it was the first store I went to) but would recommend this store to everyone!
