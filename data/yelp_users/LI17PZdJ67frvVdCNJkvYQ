My family has been coming here for years because it's one of the few authentic Chinese food places. It's always very good, and my personaly favorites are the dan dan noodles and the eggplant. They make it really spicy. I gave this place 4 stars because over the years the portion sizes of our favorite chicken dish has gotten smaller,and also the service is far short of top notch. But, if you like spicy authtentic szchwan food, I would definitley give this place a try. As for the review made by "Arizona T." That "numbing" feeling is part of the traditional flavor of  Ma la, made by a (I think some pepper thingy) That is only found in Szchwan.... so don't come here if you're a phony! This place is best for real authentic Szechwan food.

After not coming here for a whole my family decided to give it another try, and we were definitely surprised! The dan dan noodles as usual were fantastic, and what I said earlier about portion sizes getting smaller was totally wrong when they brought out the chicken! Service, which had been lacking before was fantastic. Overall, I would definitely recommend as far as Szechuan places go around here

Best roast duck in the valley. Come to this place for real authentic Chinese food. The service is alright, and I really would give it 4  stars for decor, but the food is just so good that I gave it 5 stars. I highly highly recommend the duck lo mein. It is simply to die for!

Came here with the family after being spontaneous and not eating at the hong kong diner next door. We ordered the korean beef, two of the tofu soups, and a few other miscellaneous items. Everything was really great and had a lot of flavor, the two soups were also very very good and I would definitley recommend to a first time korean food tryer. The reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because service was just okay. Nothing special. The waiters didn't really seem to care about the food or anything. Secondly, I realized that I'm not the biggest fan of korean food, but that's just me. And third, the prices were a little high. Around $90 for a family of 4/5 (My grandma eats almost nothing XD). So, we may come back here if we're really craving korean food, but it's not "too die for"

Horrible place. I've been to different sonic locations and this one is by far the worst. First of all, sonic isn't really great in the first place. This place is absolutely horrible I've tried it many times and none of them have been great The burgers here are super greasy, the burritos which I really like in other places, the ones here always have really burnt eggs and are also super weirdly greasy. The fries are always gross, and the ice cream is weirdly gritty??  So if you are craving sonic, just go to a different location.

This place is so good!!  The cashiers are so friendly (at least one of the two I've encountered is. The other is standoff-ish) and the first time I went he took the time to walk us through the menu and check up on us during the meal. I've had the rice noodle bowl (forgot the name) which was pretty average. I've also got the sweet and sour chicken which was way too sweet for my taste. My favorite here is the chicken teriyaki. It's the best I've had anywhere and their homemade hot sauce is too die for. It's like sriracha with way more flavor. $6 for the large chicken teriyaki bowl will last you two meals!! Check it out but stick to the teriyaki chicken!

The service here is great and the workers are all very friendly. I got a burger with green chile. It was incredibly delicious and fresh but could use some more seasoning. I also had the chili fries which were not as good and the cheese was just a couple squares of Kraft American singles. Overall the food was really good and I will be back to try out their breakfast food. Also the burger was decently priced. It was definitely better than in n out!

Wow! Had this for lunch and it was SO good. Came around 10:45 so right after it opened. There was no wait and I ordered immediatley. I ordered a 1/2 lb medium rare burger with american cheese, with wedge fries and a drink. Total was around $11.50 so a little pricey. It came out pretty fast, around 10 minutes. I took this time to use their AWESOME condiment bar and filled up on a ton of drinks and CHEESE. The burger was AMAZING. Best I've had in Arizona. It was cooked to perfection, (Actually it was a little closer to medium than medium rare) and seasoned AMAZINGLY. The fries were fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. Everything was great! I will definitely be back and I would love to try some of the other items here.

My last visit here can only be described as subpar.  We were seated quickly but the tables were way too crowded. We were a group of 6 but if we were 8 we wouldn't have been able to fit (even though there were 8 chairs) because we were right up to the next table. Pretty uncomfortable if you ask me.   Also it is so loud here it's hard to do anything except eat.   Food is jus pretty bad. It's typical dim sum but a lot of stuff is cold, greasy, and overlooked. If not that, it's just way overpriced.   If you want a nice ambience and good dim sum go to Mekong.

I know what you're thinking... 5 stars for taco bell??? Yes!! Of course this is biased, but I've never eaten in the store, however, I've probably went through this drive thru at least 50x (Don't judgeXD) But this place is the best taco bell in Arizona. The food here is like what you see in  the commercials! It always gives you a ton of food! Bang for your buck!!

This is the worst little Caesars I've been to. Now I already have really low expectations as it is hot n ready, but every time I get it the pizza tastes like cardboard! Like it's been in a fridge for a week. Since I live close to here I've found that bad pizza is consistent and it was never a fluke. I even tried box just ordering it fresh and waiting around 7 minutes for it and it still came out awful. The crust was too chewy and overcooked, the sauce/ toppings were skimpy (there was a full one and a half inch ring of crust around it), and the cheese was burnt. You'd expect they could at least make good fresh pizza. I'd skip this little Caesars and head to the Pizza Hut across the street or the little Caesars on Val vista and university

Our family has been coming to garys for years and have never had bad service here. Gary is quick, reliable and cheap. When my dad bought an old beat up f150, every mechanic said it was dead cause they couldn't change the oil because the kid was stuck. Finally we came here and Gary took the time to find a needle, insert it into the oil (tank?? I have no Idea) and pump the oil in then patch it up. He saved us a ton of money with that and has given life to another old minivan of ours that definitely stayed years longer thanks to Gary. However , like some people said, he is Chinese so it may be a bit difficult because of the language barrier.

Food: 4.5 stars Everything else: 2 stars   I walked in and was so confused. I had no idea how to order food. Apparently you grab a slip (which took me a while to find) that's next to the water cooler and give it to one of the ladies working in the kitchen. When I went to give it to her I got a good look at the kitchen and it is super clean. The lady who took the slip was super nice so no complaints there. There are only about 5 tables so takeout was a good choice.  I ordered the mattar paneer (pea and cheese curry) for $2.79 and a samosa for $1. Food came out insanely fast and I loved shopping for groceries while I waited. I didn't get too far into the groceries but they pretty much have everything you'd need for Indian cuisine.   When checking out the cashier wasn't really rude but definitely not friendly. He didn't say a thing to me the whole time but I can overlook that.   The food was really good. The little sign (see pictures) said that they have the best samosa in America. Now I'm not sure about that but it was probably the best samosa I've had in Phoenix. Most samosas I've had are too doughy. The samosa here was perfectly fried and the dough was closer to a pastry; it was so flaky. I would definitely get it again. The chutney was good too. It almost tastes like they combined the traditional mint and tamarind chutney into one delicious sauce- sweet, fresh, rich, and tangy. A perfect sauce for the samosa. The curry was super tasty and pretty spicy which I love. My only complaint was that the curry was way greasy. The pool of oil on top was a turn off but worth getting through for how good the curry was.   I would definitely recommend this place for fast and light Indian food. I hate that when I usually want Indian food I either have to gorge myself on a buffet or spend a lot on individual dishes. At little India I can get just as much food as I need and at a price that cannot beat. Definitely check it out!

It was a very nice dog park. I've never been to another so I can't really compare but it was a huge area full of green grass and trees. The people were nice and dogs were running around freely and getting along too. There are a bunch of plastic walmart bags which is really my only complaint, but the owners here are always really responsible about cleaning up so the park is always clean. There is also an area for timid dogs. I would highly recommend although I don't think I will be coming back soon (my dog is a little aggressive)

I have been to sauce many times and have rated it around 4.5. After not going many times, todays experience was quite different.   My friend and I split the chicken Caesar salad pizza and the chicken broccoli pasta (2 of my favorites that i recommended because she had never been to sauce before). The total was around $20, $26 with taxes and drinks.   We got our own drinks and found a seat. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. It wasn't difficult to find a seat but it was also a Monday afternoon so I imagine the place fills up quickly other times.   The ambience is great. It's very warm (not sure if that's the right word) ie the pizza oven, brick wall, and italian prints but also had a very modern vibe with it's chalkboard wall, clean finish, and high ceiling. Altogether the ambience ties together nicely and adds to a great dining experience.   After getting our drinks an sitting down, the food came out in under a minute!!! It was faster than fast food!   The food itself was five stars. The crust was thin, chewy, and supple which explains how they make it so fast. They changed how they make their Caesar salad pizzas and added a lot more asiago to their crust which really balances the flavors of the pizza. The salad on top was amazingly fresh, the dressing was homemade and robust, and the chicken too, was moist and flavorful. I personally think that the crust and salad must be eaten together which is a unique experience   The pasta was also delicious. The chicken and broccoli were cooked to perfection, the pasta was al dente, and the sauce was unlike any regular cheese sauce. Even the role that came with it was warm, chewy and homemade.   The service was 5 stars. We were constantly being checked on and although it was busy there were plenty of waiters and waitresses.   Eating here today was amazing and pretty much everything I've ever had here has been really delicious. Sauce puts a lot of thought in every single ingredient, and constantly works harder to create a better dining experience. And for around $10-$15 a person, you simply cannot beat it!  The only cons were: -Very loud (but that's what outdoor seating is for, right?) - there were no napkins (I had to ask the waiter to bring us some)

Stopped by here on a Saturday evening for some takeout. I ordered I think the #5. It was two tacos with rice and beans. It all came out fairly quickly. The food was very delicious. My steak tacos had a delicious corn Tortilla, the steak was seasoned very well, and was topped with lettuce tomatoes and cheese. It was seriously so full I'd guess there was a full 1/4 c of steak in it. The rice and beans were also quite tasty. The highlight for me was the chips and salsa. Both the green and red salsa were fantastic and the chips were truly amazing. So to cap Pro: food, portion size, service, price, local business Cons: steak was a bit dry, not entirely authentic (they had cheeseburgers and my tacos like I said had pretty "Americanized" condiments)  But as for the place itself, it was outstanding !and Id definitely recommend it

I've come here on a multitude of times and they are very consistent Pros: nice ambience/ clean store  -staff is very helpful -An amazing selection of books, music, and games  Cons -Books can be a little pricey. I am not going to pay $4 for a book with it's pages falling out and things highlighted everywhere for the same price as a book that's nearly new. I've also found CDs here to be almost right near their actual price.    I will try to sell some things here as some people have recommended. It can become a little pricier than thrift stores but you will find something really good if you look hard.

I've been here on a multitude of occasions and have tried nearly everything on the menu. Everything I've had is really just sub par so it wasn't a fluke the first time I went. Sweet pork isn't really good at all like how everyone makes it out to be. Portions can be skimpy and everything is just generally not great. It is also really busy so it takes forever to get an average and over priced meal and the staff is not accommodating. The only reason why it earned two stars was because of the freshness of their items. If anything is recommend a salad with the cilantro like vinaigrette, but you're way better off heading over to pita jungle or sauce.

Yum! First off, my family of three came on a Sunday morning around 10, so we assumed that they would be pretty busy. We had to wait for about 15 minutes, which wasn't too bad. One thing that was unfortunate was that there was obviously opened tables, at least 10 total, and there were still about 5 parties waiting. When we got in, our waiter was very nice and got us assisted quickly. We ordered: My Dad: Carnita omelet My mom: Nutella banana crepes Me: Classic Eggs Benedict Our food arrived reasonably fast and nice and hot The eggs benedict were simply fantastic, the English muffin was nicely toasted, the eggs were poached to perfection, and the hollandaise sauce was simply to die for! I will definitley order that again, next time I might try the southwestern or cali eggs benedict. One thing that wasn't great were there signature potatoes. They were really tasteless and I had to add a ton of tobasco and salt.   My dads carnita omelet was okay. The pork was bland, and there was really just nothing special about it.  My moms crepes were AMAZING I don't like crepes at all, and I thought they were amazing. The crepes were fluffy, and delicious. They weren't overpoweringly sweet, and the bananas were just perfect.I absolutely recommend it.   Will defenitley come back. Very good food

This is one of my favorite places in Mesa for Mexican food! The ambience is nice. This is definitely no _______bertos- morenos has granite countertops and TV menus. The people are super nice and the prices run at about how much you'd pay for filibertos but the food is quite a bit better.   Sonoran dogs- can't compare to Tucsons but some of the best I've found in Nesa (i.e. Way better than mickys hot dogs)  Tacos- 7/10 pretty standard street tacos Sopas- same as tacos. The meat can be dry occasionally  Tortas- see above^^^ dry meat ruins everything  Rice and beans- some of the tastiest I've had! The rice is incredibly fluffy

Came here with a couple of friends for lunch ($7) and gelato ($2-3). I can't remember the name of my panini but it had smoked prosciutto (Speck), arugula, and romano. The four sandwiches arrived in about 10 minuted. Everything was amazing and we all enjoyed our sandwiches! It was truly one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. Every ingredient was authentic and fresh. My friends ordered the parma, pescator (or something like that), and the mozz, basil, and tomato sandwich and all enjoyed it. After, we all got gelato. I got half cappuccino, and 1/2 salted caramel, and like other reviewers have mentioned, the salted caramel was amazing even though I'm not typically a salted caramel fan. I definitely recommend this place and to be honest, I actually enjoyed the panini more than the gelato so don't go just for the gelato! As for the service and other ambiance, everything was spot on. The two owners were very nice and the prices weren't too steep! Definitely recommend this place to anyone!

Came here on a Monday night with some friends. The ambience is quite nice and the we were seated quickly. We weren't really hungry so we opted for splitting a pepperoni and Hawaiian pizza. Each pizza was around $11-$12 which was a little steep but we figured they would be big. We each had 3 slices which was enough to fill us up but the pizza itself is below average. The flavor of both pizzas was abysmal and I honestly think little Caesars tastes better. I also have it two stars because I mean $11 for a tiny pizza? GO TO LITTLE CAESARS. Definitely not worth it. I would not recommend CPK when there are plenty of other good restaurants near here.

Came here and were seated quickly. The waiter was prompt and the bread we received was great.   After that it went down hill. It took the waiter another 10-15 minutes to come back and get our order. Two of us ordered the hot seafood platter and my dad ordered one of their specials (I greatly apologize that for the life of me I cannot remember what it was). All I can remember is that it was their most expensive fish special. Our food took a while to arrive, and at $25 for the fish and $30 for the platter, we were getting hungry and expected everything to be delicious.   Here is where things keep going down hill. Every thing on our seafood platter was fried which was no big deal. What was a big deal was that it was dripping oil. And everything was so salty we could not possibly finish it. The crab cakes were deep fried and definitely did my taste like crab. I had a crab cake at Golden Corral and they tasted the exact same (actually golden corrals was better).   The fish mg dad ordered was also abysmal. The taste itself wasn't too bad (but also nothing special) it was the fish itself. I don't know if it was a bad quality fish or bad preparation but it was awful in texture. We all tried some and agreed that it was incredibly dry and chewy. The $2 swai fillets from Walmart were higher quality than that. The sides were okay but again, nothing special.   If this were your average seafood restaurant I would give it two stars, but for $60 for three people, it was definitely not worth it.

Food is okay- it's Panko breaded not beer battered (although I didn't really expect beer anywhere near the temple). The prices are pretty steep considering the quality of food. The fish was cooked perfectly but the shrimp was dry. Not worth it at all, and it was very crowded when I went. There were a ton of people all dressed up and it was chaotic. There was literally hundreds of kids there. (Maybe there was an event at the Temple?). Also, bad service.

This place has great food, great prices, great service, and GREAT ambiance! The decorations were spot on. The cornbread we got to eat was truly horrible.. but it was free so I'll ignore that. It was ice cold, dry, and flavorless. I ordered the brisket with mac and cheese and spicy fries. I really though the sides were delicious, and BONUS, they're unlimited!! The brisket had good flavor but was a bit dry but the bbq sauce totally fixed that! MY party also had the fried okra, veggies, riblets, and one of the combo meals with 3 different meats. They all said it was some of the best bbq they've had! I would definitely recommend this place.

My family has eaten here a few times and it is pretty consistent. The sushi itself is really good, however, it's not the best I've had do that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. The service here is amazing! The waiter remembered our family and was very helpful and attentive. Nice place, a little expensive, but overall, good food and great service.

Really good, extremely reasonably priced sushi. We come here all the time. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because I think the Scottsdale location is way better. The salmon is a lot bigger there. I recommend  the Las Vegas rolls, haru poppers, and baked scallop rolls

I want to like this place SO bad. I love Thai food and there aren't too many around. It's also a small, family own business, but it's just not that great.  I had high expectations walking in. There were a lot of people, the reviews were great, and it was personally recommended to me by picky palates own, Jenny Flake!  It was small and cute, with great decorations, and we were seated quickly It took a couple of minutes to be given menus and it took almost 10 minutes just to get drinks.     We ordered the chicken satay, mild tom kha soup, medium chicken pad thai, medium spicy fried rice, and the pineapple curry. It took quite a while for the food to come, no to mention, the chicken satay (appetizer) came out last.  Here are my reviews on each food item. Chicken Satay: Big meaty skewers of chicken, and was very juicy, but SERIOUSLY over salted. I could hardly eat it. This was probably the best of the 4 things we ordered, which is saying something. And while eating my second skewer, I discovered it to be RAW in the middle! Really?   Tom Kha Soup: Utterly disgusting. Ordered it based anothers review on here. It was super sour. And not just lemony, because I love lemongrass and lemon! But this soup was literally inedible and was like a sour warhead.  Pad Thai: It was really very sweet and also a bit sour. We took two bites and had to throw it out.   Fried Rice: Pretty mediocre. Just fried rice, really nothing special at all. Not horrible.  Pineapple curry: Pretty good. Would order the curry if I ever come here again.  We also ordered the coconut custard with sticky rice and it was just okay.  The service was really not great either. It took a while to get the waiters attention.   Really sad to write such a bad review. I think we just got unlucky, but you'll be taking chances coming here. I, for one, will not come back. :(

There is literally no better place in the world than the Arabian Library. No kidding, I'd rather spend a day here than a week in Disneyland. I don't go to libraries for books but mostly just for getting work done, and no place does that better than here. The ambience is just amazing. The architecture of the building is flawless and the lighting makes it easy to focus. The high ceilings and the lighting adds a dimension that is extremely comforting. There are tons of places to do work. There are different tables and chairs so choose whatever suits you. The furniture is high quality and incredibly comfortable and includes wooden tables, couches, and leather chairs with foot rests. They have speedy wifi and computers are free to everyone to use ( I am not a resident of Scottsdale nor do I have a card here). Even the bathrooms here are nice. The interior design is gorgeous (yes, even in the bathrooms). They have both outdoor and indoor seating which is very accommodating. The staff here is fantastic. They also have great sections for kids and teens and they have a little food area and shop which fit in nicely. Another one of my favorite things here is how quiet it is all the time. The patrons are very respectful and it is always quiet. I haven't taken a good look at them, but the book section is a little limited because of the size of the library, however they do have a huge selection of books and movies.   This is a gorgeous institution and great for anyone who struggles to get work done at home. Come here and I swear you WILL get work done.

Once again, gave it another try and got the same thing. Small portion sizes, bland soup and rude service. A friend of ours worked here for a while and told us that she quit because her manager was so mean to her, which I am not surprised at all about.

Came here on a Thursday night and it looked pretty busy. My family sat outside which may have led to the poor service We ordered: -Baba Ganoush - Shwarma - Gyro with fries - Sprite  - Philly Cheesesteak  The food  all came out really quickly. The baba ganoush was okay, I've never had it before, and we didn't like it. The pita bread was definitley not enough for how much baba ganoush we had. Also, the pita bread was kinda stale. On the food: Shwarma: 3 stars I didn't think it was good.  I've never had it before, but my mom thought it was okay. Philly Cheesesteak: Really good. Not generous amounts of meat, but the bread on the sandwhich was to die for!  My gyro and fries: 5 stars! It was HUGE and completely chock full of meat, onions, tomatoes, and heaps of tzatziki.  The meat in the gyro was seasoned great but a little dry. The fries were honestly one of the best things there. They were hot, and crispy, and fluffy on the inside. They were also seasoned really well and not greasy.   CONS: Fries, drink, and gyro combo added up to $10 which in my opinion is a little pricey for a gyro.  - Not great service. Maybe it's because we sat outside and we were the only ones outside.   Really great. We will defenitley be here again

We've come here a few times and it's pretty consistent. If there's a lot of people, the wait is really never too long. The interior is really gorgeous with appropriate decor. There is a TON of food, and everything's good. There is  authentic Chinese food, American-Chinese food, sushi, American, and Mexican food. I was actually surprised at how good the American food was. Seriously amazing buffalo wings!! The steak was good, but the sushi sucks. Another reason for the 4 stars is that although I was expecting to see a ton of running kids, but for some reason, this place has SO many kids. I almost tripped and dropped my food 3x in one day from little kids running around. Seriously though, CONTROL YOUR CHILDREN

Pretty disappointed with this place based on the previous reviews. I got the four rolled tacos special. The rolled tacos were flavorless and lacking meat. Guac was alright but not enough to help the flavor of the tacos. The beans were incredibly salty and I probably wouldn't have been able to eat them besides the fact that the rice was incredibly bland and eating them together balanced them out a tiny bit. I got the lemonade which was mediocre, but my friend who got the pineapple drink thought that it was so sweet she couldn't drink any of it.

I'm going to make this short.  Pros: Very well kempt and clean Plenty of information and an insanely wide exhibit of instruments different than normal museums  Cons:  $15 18 and under  $20 18 and over... a little steep for me. Not great for kids. Not that I have any, but there were plenty of crying kids to tell me.  I'm not sure people who don't play an instrument or are into music will like it so be careful...  But I mean, what do you expect? The name is a musical instrument museum. It is a museum with musical instruments.

Stopped by here with some strep throat. They were very quick, and the lady up front was very nice and accommodating. The Doctor was very helpful and he offered me many different options for medicines and treatments. I've also had other family members come to this location and they all enjoyed their experience.

Yummy pizza! It's a little pricey for me, but it's really worth it. I love the combo pizzas and the chicken wings. Pros:  - Good pizza - Fill up your own soda - WIngs are good - Pretty good service   Cons - Greasy pizza - Slow - WIngs are overcooked any times

Came here for a birthday dinner. As another reviewer said, the food was mediocre at best. Really nothing good. There were big crab legs, but they were so salty I could hardly eat it. The paella was way too spicy and not as much flavorful, the beef wellington was hardly edible, the chinese station was not authentic, and the desserts had a lot of variety, but none were great. The oysters I heard from a friend was they were really good, but I'm not an oyster fan. Overall, I was expecting way better. Definitley not worth the price. I might come back for the breakfast cause it seems better than the dinner.

This place was truly a hidden gem! We came late one night and my party ordered the philly, the green chili pork ( I honestly don't remember the name), and I had the meat and cheese. In total, about $21. Mine was delicious, and like some others mentioned here... NO GREASE hangover! I tried some of the philly and it was amazing, and that jalapeno sauce was truly great! I could eat it alone.... the pork frybread, however was a little bit too salty and was the worst dish we ordered. That being said, it was still delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone, and I definitely recommend ordering the philly! The only thing that I should warn you about is that their frybread is a little  denser than what I have had before.

Sad to report that this place is closed to the public. Tried to stop here today and they had signs all over saying that they only cater??

Had the dinner buffet. Was pretty good. I liked the surroundings, lots of great authentic decorations.  The food was alright. Pretty good for my first time having Indian food. The lamb was too salty but the tikka masala was fantastic. I also loved the pudding and custard. The naan and tandoori chicken was also good and complimentary.  Last, the service was amazing! The waiters were all really great and they were constantly refilling our water and making sure our experience was nice.

I came in here expecting fairly good food and crappy service/long waits. But hey it's 9:00 on a Saturday and not a ton of restaurants were open. We walked in and were seated immediately. We were totally proven wrong about the service. It was not just standard, but AMAZING service. The waiters checked up on us constantly and were great about filling up our drinks and chips. The manager was also walking around and making sure everyone was having a great time and talked to us. Now that's someone who really cares. Anyways we ordered the toritos (I think that's what they're called), 6 oysters on the half shell, and a filet of the garlic red snapper. The food was brought out insanely fast. We got it in around 7 minutes!!   The food I must say was a solid four stars.  The garlic red snapper was to die for and making it into tacos was even more amazing, I highly recommend it and it earned a solid five stars. I was slightly less impressed with the appetizers. The oysters were very fresh but just not that great. I wish they had other options (they must have come from warm water and it is my fault for ordering oysters in August). They were fairly boring, not briny or buttery just boring. Mi had high expectations for the toritos (bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed peppers) because so many other people reviewed it. I personally thought them to be average. They were in soy sauce which I found off putting. Overall all the food including the chip and salsa were very good an we will definitely be back. I highly recommend sticking with seafood dishes. Next time I will have to get the whole fish   Also as far as ambience goes, this place gets pretty loud (music is blaring) but it's a fun place if you want a drink or want to watch a game. There "bar/club" room is separate from their main dining room with the bar in the middle so it's quieter in some places. I wasn't there when there was live music but will definitely have to be when I go there next time.  Next time if I get different food that I like, this place will easily get 5 stars.

Came here again with the whole family (6of us) after a first successful evening. Once again, the service was remarkable and the owner very friendly. The food we ordered was the whole red snapper, the fish tray, and the sistes martes ( I know I spelled that wrong but it was the soup of the seven seas). I have it 4 stars again because of this.   I got the whole fish because I thought it would be basically 2x the size of the fillet. It was definitely not, and it was a little too cooked / breaded so there was hardly any meat and way too much work. The taste still was great, but I will definitely opt for the filet next time. The seafood platter was very impressive. Everything's was cooked absolutely to perfection. The only downside was that it was pretty salty on some pieces. The red fish ( I have no idea  what it was called but it was straight out red) was my favorite because it was cooked so amazingly. It's not easy to deep fry such a small piece of fish and have it come out perfectly! Because it is all fried,  I would not recommend getting just that because I personally would get sick of it, but since we all also shared the fish (tacos) and soup, the meal was very balanced. Moving on to the soup, it was pretty good. It was cool to see snails in it as they are hard to find in AZ. It was full of different seafood which my family really enjoyed, but the broth was a bit bland. I was expecting a bouillabaisse tasting broth but it was a slightly fishy chicken broth. I'm not sure we would get that again but it's definitely a mellow flavor if you like that. Overall even though the food should have served 4 people, the 6 of us were exploding and had to work hard to finish everything. And the prices (I think $60) was so totally worth it! I mean it's hard to find such fresh seafood in AZ, but Baja joes nails it and the prices are reasonable and the portions are massive. We will definitely make this one of our regulars.

This place has seriously great food. Very fresh, good portions, and fairly good prices. We have come here quite often and the service is always good, the food is always fast, and it's tasty. We have tried all the different curries, as well as the pad thai and it is very good and has a great kick because it's very spicy. The thai iced tea is also really great, probably the best I've had. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

Got a medium pepperoni pizza for three to go. It took around 15 min which was pretty reasonable. The reason why i'm giving it 4 stars is that the employees were not very nice, a worker was smoking and drinking in the little take out area. They also seemed really young, and not too interested in helping us when we walked in to get our pizza. However, the pizza was really yummy. It had lots of cheese and pepperonis. It was a little greasy, but the crust was amazing! The crust was really crispy, but also very chewy, and the crust was also very flavorful. It had lots of parmesan cheese and garlic. Yum!

This is by far the worst library I've ever been to. We came in around 4 or 5 on a weekday afternoon and we immediately noticed there was no seating. We had to wait for someone to leave just so we could sit down and do some work. The second thing we noticed was the sound. There were literally kids screaming and running around. I will bet that ANY Mcdonalds play place is quieter than here. The architecture of the building makes things echo so when people were conversing it sounded like the inside of a middle school cafeteria. It was impossible to focus and we ended up driving 10 minutes away to the Mesa red mountain library. My other complaint is that they do not offer guest passes on their computers but that wasn't a huge deal. I only gave it two stars because it is pretty big so I'm guessing they have a good assortment of books, and the lake front view was nice ( too bad there were no seats next to it). So if you only need to grab a book and leave this library will suit you. I am never coming back here and would highly not recommend this library for someone to do work at. You're way better off working at a Starbucks or even a Mcdonalds play pen.

This is a wonderful little family run Mexican restaurant. I got a fish taco and shrimp quesadilla (Learn from my mistake and don't order this much food. The quesadilla was enormous and plenty of food).  The food arrived quickly and the woman at the counter was helpful and very nice. The restaurant is very clean and has plenty of seating and a TV. They also have a great salsa bar with plenty of salsa to choose from.   The food here is fantastic. The fish taco had plenty of fish, the tortilla was fresh, and there were an assortment of grilled vegetables inside. I gave it 4 stars because it's not your run of the mill fish taco/mexican restaurant. The shrimp quesadilla also had an amazing filling that consisted of more of the normal cheese and shrimp.  The flavors were outstanding and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because my quesadilla was pretty salty. But besides that, I will definitely be back to try a lot of their other dishes.

The first time I came here, everything was great. $2 for an ice cream sandwich of my choice. This place is a replica of LAs Diddy Riese, which sells sandwiches at $1.50. The taste was good, but the sandwich was quite a bit smaller than Diddy rieses with a 25% higher price. I know it's not fair to compare it to something in LA so with my first visit I would have rated it 4stars. This time I walked in and was in a rush. I told all my friends from LA how similar this place was to Diddy Riese and everyone was eager to try some. But, when I walked in there was no one to be found. I sat around for 5 minutes and asked hello but no one came out! It was an utter disappointment and incredibly embarrassing to my eager friends. We left and got Rita's instead. So the biggest problem is the bad (completely nonexistent) service and the fact that their ice cream sandwiches are not that cheap! I dozen cookies at walmart is $3 or homemade cookies are $2 for 2 dozen. A bucket of ice cream is $3 and with two scoops on each sandwich, that comes out to around $1 a sandwich or less if you make your own cookies like they do here! Because they don't make their own icecream, save your money and stay home!

Stopped by here for a quick snack on the way to Scottsdale after hearing the rave reviews. I only ordered the gyro. It was around 4:20 so there weren't many people there, and I was the only one in line to order. It came out very quickly and I had it to go. It was delicious! The pita was the best I've ever had, it was warm, crispy, and very flavorful. The meat was very good, and juicy. And the tzatziki was fresh and just really great. Overall, everything was great and fresh. We will definitely be back here if we're ever in Fountain Hills again. Actually, it's worth the drive anyways... definitely recommended

I came here twice. The first time in the morning at 10 ish and the service was fast, the staff was incredibly nice and talkative. And I ordered a dozen assorted donuts. They were without a doubt the most amazing donuts I've ever had. Moist. Soft, and flaky( is that a bad word? Flaky like a croissant). And totally worth the $8.   The second time I came at 5:00 ish. The service was slow and the workers were unfriendly. I ordered a dozen donut holes and six donuts. The didn't really taste the same and tasted like they had been out and a little stale for a while.   Because the donuts were so good the first time I will likely come back, but they need to work on the inconsistency

$5 for a medium drink? No thank you. That was the biggest turn off for me (come on it's more expensive than Starbucks). The menu is very confusing, drinks taste average, and there is no just plain coffee. Every single drink is ridiculously sweet and because you cannot get a small coffee drink, the drinks are impossible to finish. I only gave it two stars because the staff is very nice. For anyone who lives overpriced sugary coffee, Dutch bros is great, but for anyone looking  for a cup of black coffee this is so not your place.

I take back my previous review because apparently there is black coffee but I couldn't figure it out. Dutch bros has really grown on me and the main reason for 4 stars is because of the super friendly staff. They also have really smooth coffee. I took away one star because their mixed drinks or insanely sweet

Great service and great subs. I always order an 8in with roast beef, mayo, provolone, and onions. It is always fresh and they never fail to skimp on the meat. These subs are to die for. The only reason why I knocked off a star is because as someone mentioned before, the cheesesteaks are really... Not to die for at all

Love this place! It's very clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is yummy. I'm not a huge fan of the tostados but the steak quesadilla is to DIE for. We come here often and it's always great. Also, don't forget to try the pico de gallo, it's one of my favorite things about this place

After going here more and more often, the less I like it. The food is okay, but the biggest thing is that the prices are really steep and you're going to find way better taco places elsewhere.

Came to this place after going to the  Chandler location for many years. Obviously, it's not the worlds best sushi, but it's dang cheap and I typically pay around $14 /person and I eat a lot! Like you can get super full. It's really good, and I gave it another star (I gave the Chandler location a 4) because the sashimi is way bigger and super great!!  I recommend the haru poppers, the baked scallop rolls, and the las vegas rolls. If you are a sushi fanatic and looking for some good cheap food, come here!

Pretty great food. It's really just popular for being the chain it is. It's a little chaotic and always full, but it's a great experience. I've tried quite a few of the items and been here multiple times, so here are my reviews for them. Chili cheese hotdog: Great! Chock full of cheese, chili, and onions. The hotdogs are great quality and the buns are soft, and delicious. Make sure to get the jumbo size! Definitley a lot bigger, but not too much more expensive.  Regular Hotdog: Just okay. I guess I'm not fans of any chicago dogs, but on the bright side, the thing was very full!  Italian Beef: MMMM!! What can I even say? The first bite was a little weird, but as I kept eating, it got more and more amazing!! The beef is perfectly cooked, and almost buttery tasting, and has a little kick of heat. THe flavor is seriously amazing, and bread compliments it perfectly. And for those who complain it's soggy, it's dipped in the juices! If you don't like it, ask for it "Dry"   Cheese Fries: The fries are quite generic, but they're cooked perfectly crispy, and the inside is very soft. The cheese, as always, is great.  Burgers: They're pretty great. But why would you order a burger at Portillos? Good, but not recommended unless you're not a fan of anything else here.  Chopped Salad: Pretty good. But still, not worth it.  It has a very unique flavor and a nice sweet tang. Probably not worth getting again.  Chocolate cake shake: Just okay, great for chocolate lovers, but too sweet in my taste.  Overall, if you're a hotdog fan and looking for a great hotdog in the valley, this is defintley recommended. I also recommend the italian beef. One thing about this place is that it can add up to be a bit pricey if you order a few things.

Discovered this place thanks to the yelp reviews even though I've seen it hundreds of times in Mekong. It is located in Mekong and looks like it is a part of a food court with a bunch of random tables. We ordered the dan dan noodles ($5), pork and vegetables potstickers($4.60), and the short rib soup($6)The lady at the counter was very sweet and helpful with our order and unlike a previous reviewer experienced, our food arrived in nearly 7 minutes max. It seemed like the gyoza takes the longest because that arrived last for us and another customer their ordered gyoza that arrived very slowly. The food was all fantastic. I highly recommend the dan dan noodles. The noodles are home made and the sauce is fantastic. They give you tons of it and never skimp on the meat. But the flavor alone is incredible, it's spicy, maybe a little bit sweet, fresh from green onions and cilantro, and the meat sauce packed even more flavor. The short rib soup on the other hand was not as "lively" but my mom who ordered it said the flavor was still great and it tasted like the soup her mom made. She also noted that the short ribs were cooked perfectly. I took a bite and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of brothy soups. The gyoza was also cooked very good. The skin may have been a little thicker that I prefer, but the filling is great. I could eat the meat in it by itself! I also recommend that, because Im not normally a potsticker fan! Our experience was really good and we also ended up taking 40 frozen gyoza home($10)! The vibe we got from it is that it had a Very homelike feel to it. It is truly just great home cooking! We are happy to have found this place and we will definitely be back soon.   Pros:  -Great Food -Cheap -No Msg -All homemade stuff (noodles and chili sauce are made in store!)  Cons: -The seating area is gross, so we will probably take out food from here next time -They have a jug of water that you get yourself but it's room temperature -Gyoza can take a long time from what I've gathered

Came here on a Friday night and it was not crowded at all! We ordered the beef pho. It came out really fast. It was really delicious, and very authentic. Also, the service here is AMAZING the waitress seems like she actually cares about your experience, and she's very attentive and not at all annoying. the reason I gave it 4 stars is because the portion is a little bit smaller than l'm used to, and also because it's pricier than my other place. So although it was really great, I'll probably stay with my other favorite Pho place, Thuan Thanh.

Update: Had again tonight. My party ordered the vietnamese beef over rice, the green curry, and the pho. The food was very good, Vietnamese beef over rice was cooked perfectly, and my curry was very flavorful, but also a bit spicy so be warned. They ran out of beef for the pho, unfortunatley, so my dad  got the beef chow fun. It took a while to come out and we were already there for a long time, however, the food was delicious (And on the house) so no worries there! ONce again, a lovely experience at Simis and we will be back. Also, to add again, the service here is fantastic!!! Top notch! We'd come back just because the waitress is so good at what she does!!

I ordered the shwarma based off the reviews as well as the beef and chicken plate, and falafel. Everything was quick and of course, delicious. The garlic sauce they give you ties everything together, as does the hot green sauce. I came here looking for the Phoenix equivalent to New York's "Halal Guys" (Google it, they're amazing) and this was the closest I've come. The chicken was flavorful and moist. The falafel was unbelievably light but still crispy, the rice was cooked perfectly and not sticky whatsoever, and the white sauce, like I said.. is awesome. The people working are also great even though I was not expecting service from a mall fast food establishment. I hope they do not move, or if they do, to somewhere right next to my house! The people and food here are worth the trip!

My family came here one night and it was really empty. You can tell they've redone the place but it has a very weird vibe (giant TVs with nothing playing, different  chairs at each table, etc)   We ordered the spicy noodles, pumpkin curry, pad Thai, Thai tea, and the sticky rice dessert. Food came out in a timely manner and service was great.    The food was pretty good. The noodles were flavorful and the meat was tender. My mom got the pumpkin curry and we all agreed that it was delicious, it was easily our favorite dish. The pad Thai is the reason for four stars. It was extremely sweet to the point that no one ate any of it. The Thai tea was flavorful and delicious as well as the sticky rice.   The price, ambience, and pad Thai is why Thai plates did not get five stars

This is the best Vietnamese food in the city! Definitley a hiden jewel. My family even came here two nights in a row when we first discovered it!! The pho is absolutley fantastic, probably the best I've ever had. The menu also has many other Vietnamese foods which is a pleasant change from some of our other pho places. It is all fresh (NO msg) It's also really cheap ($5 ish for a bowl of pho and other soups) or at least cheaper than some other pho places in the valley. Seriously though, if you love pho, I would definitely check this place out!! It really should get 4 stars, but the pho is THAT good.  It should get 4 stars because it takes a while to get your food, and the surface isn't the best. Also, the decor is a little random, so it's not really somewhere to go on a date.  And, the first time we went it took 30 minutes to get our food. However, the staff were very kind and apologized

I decided to update the review to point out how consistent this place is. Everything we've ever had here is amazing and incredibly cheap (pho is $5.50 and banh mis are $2). I have no idea how a previous reviewer spent $30 here because out family of four never goes over $25 dollars. It's a hole in the wall place and sometimes it does have an interesting smell/ can be dirty.... But the fact that the food is so good makes this place worth it. We come here twice a week!

Zio's is the best pizza I've had in Arizona. I ordered a white pie and cannoli pretty late at night for takeout. It was there when we got their for pickup. The pizza was the closest NYC pizza I've found in Arizona and seriously amazing. My only complaint is that the menu says that the white pie has marinara but it didn't which is fine because I prefer my white with white sauce but that could be misleading. The cannoli was also some of the best I've had but pretty over priced ($3.99 for 3 small 3 inch cannolis). We'll definitely be back!

Dropped by here for lunch and we are so glad we did!   Hometown dogs has a mom n pop feel to it and it is a small restaurant. Jr and Tee, the owners were amazing and made the experience worthwhile! The service could make this place five stars but let's talk about the food. I ordered a combo dog with chili, nacho cheese, and jalapenos with a side of the green chili pie. For $6.99 it was unbelievable! The hot dog was great, chili was great, and the toppings enhanced the whole thing (what does nacho cheese not enhance??) The green chili pie was green chili pork covered fritos with onions and cheese and was also delicious! Where else are you going to find a green chili pie as a side?? Someone said it before but I'll say it again, the sides here are AWESOME.  My sister got  mushroom and swiss dog and also liked it a lot. She got the frito pie and ate it even though she doesn't like chili. That's how good it is! There are also tons of different options that all look amazing so we will definitely be back. (and a punch card to motivate us)  Their dogs are really good and have a nice snap to them and are super filling. For $16 total, you can't beat it! They also have award winning salsa that we will also be back to try out.

I love banh mis and this place has the best ones I've had in Phoenix. Service: Fast Some staff members aren't fluent English speakers but it's never been a problem for me. I've never had any wrong orders... even the difficult ones  Ambience:  Very clean restaurant TVs  Food:  AWESOME. The bread is super soft, but chewy on the outside and always freshly baked The vegetables are incredibly fresh and there's a perfect amount of everything Pate comes on pretty much all the sandwiches-I'm not the biggest fan but it's really good as far as pate goes Meat: My favorite is the grilled pork and grilled chicken. Both are full of flavor and moist. I've found the barbecued pork to be dry (Char siu), the meatballs are mushy but I like the flavor, and the steak is a little bit chewy. That really is my only complaint...   Drink: The avocado and taro smoothies are the absolute best I've ever had! And I've had every single boba drink on Dobson...  Price: The sandwiches are great deals. They run around $3.75 each. Which is amazing. Combos come with a smoothie or tea and are around 6-7$. I wish that the drinks alone were a tad cheaper (around $4) but I can't really complain because they're so good.   Overall, I highly recommend this place. It's not perfect, but they're going to have the best banh mis and sandwiches in Mesa and Phoenix.

I haven't been to the store so this is just the review of the product I purchased when I was at the Gilbert farmers market. The man working was very nice and helpful and let me sample many items before choosing something. I finally decided on the toffee and the pecan bacon scribbles. The flavor is indescribable but both items were delicious. The toffee was the best I have ever had. We will definitely be purchasing more things here. I have if 4 stars because it cost me $10 for two little tiny pouches of food.

The service is good, which is why it deserves 2 stars, but as far as food and subs go, you're going to want to go somewhere else. I've been here twice and both subs were abysmal. I can't remember exactly what it was but it was a thin with roast beef. Basically $4 for some dense chewy bread with 1 slice of meat. It would have been $5 with 1 slice of cheese. The second time i ordered a different sub but it was still small and tasteless. Besides service, the only other nice thing about here is that their ingredients are always fresh and they bake their own bread ( I mean the bread sucks but at least it's baked in store).

Nandinis is hands down the best Indian Buffett in the valley.  the rice is perfect, mango lassi and chai come with the meal (and they are both delicious), and all the food is spectacular. I love the tandoori chicken, spinach (paneer I think?) and the paneer masala. Oh an the naan, it is uncomparable. So hot and so garlicky, it might be worth the trip just for the naan. The buffet also has dessert. I am a massive fan of their rice pudding.  So food is 5 stars.  Service is also 5 stars. We were given plenty of attention and rarely had a dirty dish on the table. The Buffett has a nice ambience and is very clean. At around $11-12 for weekends and $9-10 on weekdays, this place it is affordable but I wish it were a bit cheaper so I could come more often. That being said it is probably some of the best Indian food you will ever eat in Arizona.

Service was great and the owners are nice. We got 6 donuts consisting of maple bars, the apple crumble, jelly, and glazed. They were reasonably priced and pretty good. I have them four stars because they are good, but not as good as Bosa. I would rank them also slightly worse than Krispy kremes

Firehouse is a great place for lunch. I love the Italian sub. It has perfectly soft, yet toasted and warm bread. The lettuce is sliced thinly, as is the meat (although there is more than plenty of meat) so your sub isn't sliding around everywhere. They have their own dressing which adds great flavor.  The service is friendly and relatively quick and the place is really clean.  I also love that they have a plethora of hot sauces to choose from.  I only give it 4 stars because it's a little pricier than I'd like to pay for lunch everyday.

This is a cute little authentic Shanghai and Sichuan based restaurant.  Our family (from Shanghai) has been coming here for years and this is about as authentic as it gets! I would recommend the spongy tofu and peanuts, xiao longbao, rice cakes (patties?) and the garlic a-Choy. The service is decent, the place is clean, the food comes fast, and the prices are great!

Bistro a La Mode is basically the lower level of Stonebridge Manor. They built the restaurant into the house which is why I was so incredibly confused about this place for years! But rest assured, there are plenty of signs signaling you where to go.  The first time I went, my sister and I ordered the "Grown up Grilled Cheese" and the Beef Bourguignon. The food totaled around $12 which was not bad at all.  The food arrived very quickly and the plating was gorgeous. The food was even better. I had some of my sisters grilled cheese which had some sort of pot roast in it and swiss on sweet potato bread. I tried hers and it was amazing! I know it was "Just a grilled cheese" but it was still great. The flavors in every dish here are very nuanced. The beef had a rich borderlaise-ish sauce. And the sweet potato bread added a nice sweetness.   My pot pie was also plated beautifully and I was shocked with how great the pie was. Bistro a La Mode has a lot of French influenced dishes and I could really taste the demi-glace in the sauce-- something not a lot of restaurants do because of the price. The Pate a brisee was also wonderful and I loved the "a la mode" mashed potatoes on top.   The food was so good that my sister and I decided to still order dessert. We got the pie of the day and the pastry of the day. Again, there were a lot of nuances in flavor and I could tell that the chef had put a lot of thought into what makes up the dish. Speaking of the chef-I believe her name is Tess (?), came out to see how we were doing. She was so sweet and I could tell that she was passionate about the food she made.   Back to the food: the "baklava", while not authentic (on croissant dough, not phyllo) was still amazing and was served with a lemon curd whip. The pie was also good, and again, served beautifully.   We finished our meal with a cute receipt in a book and were amazed that two lunches (with hefty portions), two desserts, and one drink came out to around $20. I would expect to pay $40 for that quality of food!  The second time we went, I took my whole family and it was a bit more underwhelming because the potatoes needed a bit more salt, service and food were a little slower,the filet mignon had chewy, tough pieces of meat, and the tomato soup way too thick and not very flavorful. The rice pudding creme brulee and grilled cheese of the day were still delicious though, and I am still giving Bistro a La Mode 5 stars because although the second trip was inconsistent with the first, the food was still great.  Also, they let you walk around the grounds of the manor so it's really quite a nice overall experience- and because we lie so close, we will definitely be back! Even if you don't live close, try it out!   The great thing about this place is that the manor does not depend on its restaurant to keep it afloat-- meaning-- Bistro a La Mode does not sacrifice quality of food for price.

This place is brand new so the area is still really clean. Is it weird that I noticed that first? Anyway, we were seated quickly and the waitress was nice and spoke Chinese (we spoke Chinese back don't worry.. the point I'm making is that there is a high degree of authenticity here).  Food looked fresh and delicious and not like it had been sitting out for a long length of time. Everything was delicious but they get 5 stars for excellent sushi and oysters. There oysters are seriously good quality for the price. I'd expect o pay $10 for a half dozen.   So if you like fresh seafood, this is the place to go. Everything else here is just pretty good and standard buffet food but the seafood gives it 5 stars and makes it better than Pacific Buffet.

I am so happy this place is here! McDowell and Val Vista was in desperate need of some sort of restaurant and this did the trick. It is on North Val Vista and the 202.  The place is clean, only outdoor seating, walk up window, and has nice misters. It's a very laid back restaurant.   Their menu is simple with a few burritos, pulled pork, brisket, and sides. My sister and I ordered the green chili ground pork burrito, 1/4 lb brisket, Mac salad and lemonade.   The woman working was really nice but since it's so laid back, there wasn't any service beyond that. We were the only ones there so the food came out incredibly quickly which was nice.  The burrito was extremely underwhelming. It was literally just a tortilla with ground pork and green chili sauce. No guac, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese or anything. Not that I'm complaining though... That would be fine IF the filling was good enough to stand alone. It was not. It was relatively flavorless. Also, it was a bit smaller than an average burrito and not worth it on the price so we will probably pass on the burritos in the future.  The brisket sandwich on the other hand was amazing. Great, juicy brisket with a smoke ring!! Bread was soft and buttery and there was some mayo sauce that highlighted the meat beautifully. The free sauces at the table also helped pull the sandwich together. I got the 1/4 lb but should've paid the extra $2 o get a 1/2 lb. You can also order by the lb which I think we will do in the future.   Finally, the macaroni salad was really delicious. Lots of great flavor, not too much mayo, and lots of great crunch from the cabbage and carrots. I imagine that they use a similar recipe for there coleslaw and will definitely get coleslaw on my sandwich next time. But I would have liked a little more.  We paid around $18 total which was a bit pricier than we would like to. But overall the food was great and the restaurant itself has a nice vibe.   We will definitely be back, seeing as it is the closest restaurant to our house, but will pass on the burritos in the future. We will definitely be getting brisket by the pound and Mac/coleslaw by the quart! And will try the ribs and pulled pork seeing how great the smoked brisket was.   I hope they either lower their prices a little or increase portion size and hopefully make their menu bigger. I think jalapeño bucks would be a great barbecue place and offer traditional style Texas barbecue instead of just sandwiches.

I take back a part of my last review. Nothing about it was false but I think the owners of JB are really good about listening to customers. I come quite often and I've seen noticeable differences. The portions are way bigger which is why JB deserves 5 stars.   But anyways.. Jalapeno bucks is truly tex mex food. It has barbecue and burritos. The brisket is awesome, and I like the red chili burrito. It's different than any I've had before. They slow cook it all day so it's super tender and has a great heat. There's nothing else in the burrito besides the pork, unless you ask for cheese and beans which is why I say it's different, and I agree that it's kind of liquidy but it's really good. I'm not a fan of the other two burritos though but you might like it. The Mac salad is sweet, pasta is al debate, and is the best Mac salad I've ever had. Beans and rice are also great. The beans are the best I've ever had.   As for the ambience, it's all outside so i prefer taking it to go. Service is also great. The couple/owner (my guess) is so nice and they always remember me! I can tell how much they genuinely care about JB.   My complaints are that Mac salad can occasionally be too drenched in dressing and they don't have the best hours (although the lady there told me they'd be expanding to Monday's when it gets cooler!)   Overall though the food is so worth it. It's worth trying out.

I've been here twice and it's my favorite Mediterranean place in Mesa!   The first time I got the two choice plate with chicken shawarma, Kefta, rice, and spicy hummus. Everything came out quickly (pick up order) and was delicious although I found the shawarma to be a little dry. Also, the pita bread is AWESOME-warm, buttery, and not chewy at all   This time I got the chicken kabob, spicy hummus, salad, and kefta. This wasn't on the order form but thy were extremely accommodating. They even gave me veggies to go with the hummus because I didn't want pita bread. The kefta is super flavorful and probably my favorite item here. The kabob tasted just like the shawarma. They were both chicken breast which was kind of a bummer since I expected dark meat on the kabob. It was flavorful but dry. I normally don't review salads (salads are salads) but the salad here was delicious- great balance of flavors and everything was so fresh. For $10, this was an extremely filling and delicious meal, and low carb! My only complaint about this meal was that the tzaziki was not good at all. It was just off and I couldn't really eat any of it-I hope this was just a fluke.  The service is good too. I can't say much since I've only gotten pickup but everyone is extremely professional, and super nice. The cashier even gave me a free sauce. Definitely try this place out and get the kefta, pita bread, or salad!! I can't wait to try everything else on the menu!
