This is one of my favorite place to go. Its low key and fun and always full of interesting people. Could the bathrooms be cleaner- yes. Could the "dance floor" be bigger-sure. Do I want to venture elsewhere for a dance party- No way.

I love coming here for sushi, I like the location, however the noise and inefficiency of some of the staff can be a little tedious. But not so much that I'll never go back.

Firstly I would like to say that I love the food here, each time I have visited the food has been delish. However the food cannot make up for the horrid service and horrible managing. We spent well over 2 hours waiting on one pizza and one salad. The manager was not where in sight and the server was either very new or just not well trained. I do not recommend this place based solely on service.

I first started with the 21 day challenge, initially I was just looking for a few ways to spice up my work outs and put some pep in my step. I was impressed with the thorough consultation and Richelle's analysis of my needs and limitations. I am not a person that is in amazing shape, but I never feel like I can't do the work outs. She modifies them to your needs. The classes themselves are interesting and challenging. I especially love the camaraderie with the other campers. Its a lovely gaggle of women and feels very empowering. I would definitely recommend trying out the Ultimate Body Bootcamp. You, your body and your health will be thankful for it.

Finally a coffee spot! I love everything on their menu! The staff is glorious! I send their bags of coffee to family out of state to they know whats up! My only suggestion would be a nice dog friendly covered patio!

I was so excited to try Nicos!! Keely was our server and she was VERY enthusiastic! She had great suggestions! I had the italian sausage pasta and ordered the Piedmont! My friend and I shared the sticky toffee chocolate cake (OMFG) and had an espresso! I would recommend this to anyone that wants  decadence and deliciousness. If your gonna bat an eye at the prices, you don't deserve to indulge in the wonder!
