Moved here in a pinch when it was formerly Mill Pointe but they merged with the property behind them. You definitely get what you pay for. My kitchen drawers were constantly off the tracks and the kitchen was made with the shorty stuff so they couldn't repair it while I was in there. There were police there at least once a week. I got excited over a three week span when there were no cops. Turning in/out at rush hour is horrendous. I also have a dog who is 100% (not a puppy, never pat sat) house trained and they fined me for having "heavy pet urine ozone lost four years". When I moved in I commented on the smell and I had the place cleaned before I moved, also I was only there for one year. They will fine you for anything they can for shitty apartments and maintenance requests take forever to happen if they happen at all. Mine were conveniently 'lost'.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Only reason they have two stars is because the only roach I saw on move out day and that's rare in tempe. -The former resident who had never written a horrible review before

Nighttime Nosh is the best!!!!  Ice cream, cereal, and pizza at 3am after a night of celebration?! Most genius idea to ever hit Tempe area!!!! Online, phone, and an app ordering.....they couldn't make it any easier to have munchies after everything closes!!!  Try them for yourself! You won't regret it!

Absolutely great service! Had the entire place packed quickly and efficiently. Nothing was broken and they took extra care to wrap glass/mirrors. Definitely using them again the next time I move!

Super impressed! I did a Yelp search to find someone quickly I order to move out and scheduled for the next day. Got a call within 15mins of arrival and the job was done exceptionally. I'm definitely getting my deposit back. If I ever need carpets cleaned again I know who I'm calling.
