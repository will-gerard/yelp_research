I am a Realtor who has been referring Prime Roofing to my clients for over 10 years now and couldn't be happier.  My clients always give them rave reviews because of the excellent customer service and the reasonable pricing.  I appreciate having a good roofer that I can rely on for my clients.

I will never use their shoe repair services again.   I brought several pairs of shoes in to be retipped.    This is only the first or second time I have worn one of the pairs since picking them up a few weeks ago.   Both tips fell out before noon.   I just ran over there to see if they could quickly fix them and I was accused of lying! Hummmm, great customer service.   He did offer for me to leave them and I would be charged another $10!
