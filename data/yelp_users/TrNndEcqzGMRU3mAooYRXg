I've been going to Dr K for over ten years now and have referred friends, who then have referred friends because he is SO good at what he does! He's very thorough and professional but best of all he's become a friend! So going to the dentist doesn't seem like such a pain-staking experience!!! His staff is also very caring and great, they make it a priority to work around my difficult schedule too!   You da best DR. K!

This is a must for authentic Italian food and atmosphere. Happy hour all day on Sunday's. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and my boyfriend had the chicken rigatoni. Both were excellent. The bartender Alex was great. Great service, great food, good prices and a lot of choices!!!

Amazing spa! I wish I could remember the girls name that gave me the best massage I've ever had!! It was like mikala? Or something. I usually go to the phonecian but this massage was only $63. I would have happily paid $150. I will be going back.

We watched football there this past Sunday and say at the bar with Alex. She is fabulous! Great bartender and entertaining and sweet for a Scottsdale bartender. They have a pretty good happy hour and was a decent spot to watch football if you don't like big sweaty dudes yelling at the TV.

Ugh the mussels verde were disgusting. Small portion with three mussels and even delivered with one closed! Good service though. It was comped but very fishy

My first time using an airbrush studio and I loved it!! Book with Harley. She is so cute and nice. Easy experience. The tan looks great and for first timers it was only $20! I will be booking with her again :)

Wanna be Pink Taco. Bad service at the bar, the manager explained my friends meal at "beef" even though she is a vegetarian and it wasn't that taco. Juke box is a horrible idea. Had to listen to eminem and heavy metal. They send out meals according to when it's ready and prepared so it doesn't get cold in the back, yet it gets cold because you don't want to be rude and start eating without your company having their food. The place itself is very cute and could be really cool, unfortunately I was let down. Save your money and go to chipotle

I used to visit saltys back in the day when it first opened. Not the best quality food but it was the place to be. The past few years I always suggest going there for a good patio spot but not a place to get good service or food, until today. We had a great bartender named Ben. He made our drinks exactly how we asked and didn't shrug at our sorta demanding needs. He even took our picture to help celebrate our day off! Even more surprising they have a lunch special where you can choose a starter, an entree, 2 sides (sorta like a bento box) It was actually really really good. And it was only $8!!! I would def recommend that to somebody who wants a healthier easy and delicious meal in old town. With a great view and patio! Thanks for changing my option salty seniorita!!!

Horrible uncomfortable chairs, no music, bad service. I only came to meet up for drinks and we all decided on a scale of one to ten, this place is a 4. Not impressed nor will keep this on my radar

Tuna tartar and burrata was good. TERRIBLE service!!! And it wasn't even busy for hh on a Monday yet nobody wanted to help. The girls next to us were complaining too that they weren't getting service. Tried to charge me $16 for a kettle dirty martini.... Um excuse me??? It's a wanna be Yacht club with terrible club music. The owner did take off the up charge for the martini which was nice. Won't be returning though! Better places to visit
