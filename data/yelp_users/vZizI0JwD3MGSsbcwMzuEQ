Terrible! Some of the worst service and management I've ever seen! Our server said about two words to us the entire time, and checked on us one time before bringing us the check. The manager looked completely unprofessional, he was chewing gum, had blood shot eyes, and smelled like alcohol! The food was overpriced, their pancakes cost $8 without any sides. I will never go back again...

I've been to a number of gyms across the valley including LA Fitness, Gold's Gym, and LifeTime Fitness and this gym is by far the best! Everything you need without the hassle of a long term contract! Very affordable at around $25 a month. Friendly staff and personal training available as well. Definitely check it out if you're looking for a new gym!
