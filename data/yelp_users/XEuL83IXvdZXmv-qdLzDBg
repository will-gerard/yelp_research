Gentlemen, if you want to feel like a king for 45 minutes to an hour come to V's where you will undoubtedly be treated like one.  Get a hair cut and the guys here will take their time to make sure that every hair is trimmed properly, every line is perfect, and that you are looking your best when you walk out. Plus a flat razor edging that is perfect. If you want that king treatment I was talking about, after you get the haircut, get the full on flat razor beard shave and sit back and relax. First they trim up your beard to your liking so if you want to go from a full beard to just a goatee, mustache, or strap, they'll get it right. Then comes the warm lather and hot towel wrap. I swear I have fallen asleep at this part. So relaxing. Then comes the shaving itself. They take their time here. They get it right. They go over and over and make sure you have a smooth shave. Then another round of the hot towels and finished up with some after shave and you are out the door to go conquer your next battle.

My parents actually took me here when visiting. Thank god because the prices are a weeee but more than what I can easily afford. Pretty pricey. I had elk medallions. Now, that...was..amazing!!! So tender and juicy. Good flavor and sear. It was awesome. Had some potatoes and carrots on the side. Great meat but a little pricey for what we got!

Garlic stir fry with pork (medium or hot) is delicious. Comes with steamed white rice and that's all you really need. Get it to go and it comes in a bowl that you can dump the rice into and mix it all up. One tasty tasty dinner here my friends.  Friends have had the pad see ew with chicken and once with beef. Pretty tasty. A little sweeter than I personally would want it but the meat and noodles are cooked well.  Had the Thai Toast. Not a huge fan. But I have never had it before so I have nothing to compare it to. Just tasted a bit oily to me. Deep fried a bit too much.

This place is now my favorite Chinese joint in Phoenix. You walk in and the first thought is "oh no. This is not a restaurant. This is a room with chairs and tables." But then you order. And the magic begins. Great sized portions for the lunch menu. Free egg roll, cream cheese wanton, and fried rice with every lunch special. The egg roll is wonderful. A few of those alone and you have a meal. The entrees are huge portions with as much white rice as you can eat. Twice Cooked Crispy Pork=amazing. General Tso's Chicken=awesome. Complimentary Egg drop soup=hearty. I bought 2 lunch specials, 1 entree, and 2 sodas and it was less than $23. I will be back there often.
