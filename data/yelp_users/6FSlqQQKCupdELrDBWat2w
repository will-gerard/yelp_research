I first learned of this place by invite. Two of my closest friends suggested Rosita's Place as a place to meet for lunch and since my first visit, I was hooked and with any luck, you might be too.

This is by far one of the better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. It's location is not desirable for some, but it is well worth going to and enjoying some good food. The lines can get crazy at times, but it is a popular place by all.  You cannot go wrong by visiting this place and sampling the food. Take some tortillas with you, too, if you get the chance.

I am always skeptical when someone claims they have a good mechanic. I never know if there will be an attempt to upsell unnecessary repairs, include maintenance fees that are questionable, or delay in getting the car back to me. That said, I do consider a mechanic if they are reputable.  I first heard of Kobar's through a coworker. I was told the owner would complete the necessary repairs and depending on ones' budget, he would advise you what was necessary for the automobile to function properly.  Otherwise, he was not going to upsell anything.  Much to my surprise, my coworker was right. I took my vehicle this past week to have the tension pulley replaced. I met with Gene and he was extremely professional. He was able to have the repair done the same day and the price was fair. I will continue to visit Kobar's in the future and if you're in the area, I would recommend Kobar's.

Moving to the Gilbert area, I scouted the downtown area with some hope that I would find some good food. Thankfully, I read about Joe's Real BBQ, checked it out, and continue to visit every chance I get.

I am an avid shopper at Banana Republic and will likely continue shopping in the future. That said, I will not shop at the Banana Republic store in the Chandler mall. I shopped at this location a number of times since it is near my home; however, my recent visit to the store has since caused me to re-evaluate the need to shop there. The service the employees provided was extremely poor and at times, very unprofessional. I was quite surprised since there were few customers in the store and ample time to address any questions one might have. Additionally, the employees were preoccupied with their discussion rather than trying to be of assistance.  Sorry BR, I think I may drive to the Gilbert or Ahwatukee locations.

I am a big fan of Pita Jungle. I visited the Tempe location while attending ASU and was extremely happy when the Gilbert location opened. The food is great, the servers are attentive, and there are always great pieces of art work on the walls.   If you have yet to visit, I recommend the Jalapeno Cilantro or Roasted Bell Pepper Hummus. If you want to try both, be sure to ask for half n' half and ask the server for the Greek pita or cucumber slices.  There is one downside to the restaurant and that is the location on a busy Friday, Saturday, or any other busy night. Park away from the entrance so you are not circling for a spot and/or waiting to be seated.

If you are in the Phoenix area, High Noon Tattoo is worth checking out. I had a couple of tattoos done a few years ago and had hoped to return to the same tattoo artist. Unfortunately, his store closed and he moved out-of-state. So I asked around, asked friends, and searched the internet. I knew the next tattoo I wanted required someone who could do portraits well. After all, I was not going to pay $ and later ask to be on "Tattoo Nightmare."       I eventually heard about Mikey at High Noon Tattoo. From the very beginning I was extremely pleased by his artwork online. I called him up, scheduled an appointment, and during my visit, I really liked the eclectic mix of western inspired furniture and some truly wicked (wicked being good) artwork. Further, the tattoo he ultimately did was done well. Mikey was extremely attentive to detail, the portrait looked like the picture I provided him, and the price was reasonable for the amount of time needed to tattoo my right leg.      I definitely plan to visit Mikey again before the year is out and I recommend you check High Noon Tattoo, too.
