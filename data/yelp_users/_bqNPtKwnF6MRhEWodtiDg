I love this place! Its the best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh! I absolutely love the chicken tikka masala, it is sooo good!! My boyfriend and I ordered take out once and I like spicy rating of 1 and he likes a 7 and when we got home and tried it they were both sevens. So if you're really sensitive like me, make sure to double check your order. I would definitely recommend Taste of India! I also really like all the vegetarian options!

Great, cozy place to grab a beer and watch a game! They have pretty good food with reasonable pricing. I really like the chicken pesto sandwich!  The service isn't the best but if you're really into watching a game its less noticeable lol! I do prefer the Squirrel Hill location over Bloomfield. Both have on street parking, but in bloomfield its easier to find parking.   All and all this is one of my favorite sports bars!

I recently moved to Pittsburgh and was in serious need of an eye brow wax when I came across reviews about Shelly on the internet. My experience did not live up to my expectations at all.  I asked from the very beginning to keep them on the thicker side and bascially the same shape, only cleaned up a little. What I ended up with was one eyebrow that was thinner and shaped differently than the other. She rushed through the appt and the pricing is absolutely ridiculous for such a botched job. I could have gotten a better wax at a cheap nail salon. My eyebrow still hasn't grown back to its normal shape. And she uses strips which I think aren't as good as hard wax   NOT worth your money!!  Sincerely, Disappointed

I'm changing my review after a bad hair cut that was not handled correctly. I went in told her what I wanted, showed a picture and she decided to barely look at it and totally ignore everything I said. I said I wanted some short layers in the front and long layers in the back and I wanted victoria secret model hair. Instead she took the opportunity to do whatever she wanted and I ended up with chopped off layers of one length on the sides and no long layers in the back. It looked like I had 2 haircuts one that was shoulder length and the rest long. Nothing was blended, it just did not make any sense nothing about it was good. It was horrible.  When I went back to get it fixed by her she just kept trying to defend why she did the hair cut and why it looked good. Ignoring the fact that I was unhappy and I didn't like it. She just kept trying to cover her ass instead of listening to my concerns. The fix turned out ok but still not what I wanted in the first place.  I just wanted her to listen to me and stop making excuses. And I thought the manager or head stylist should have come over to talk with me but that never happened. The front desk girls were not friendly or helpful as well.  So I will never go back and I'm sorry for suggesting this place since I only got a trim the first time I went here and could have had the same cut from anywhere.

Viktoria is the best esthetician in the world!!!!!!!!!!!! I have been going to her for years but recently moved to the east coast and if I had the money I would seriously fly back every time I needed a wax just for her. Absolutely a miracle woman she takes her time and is perfection!!!! Highly highly recommend!!!!!!!

I have never been to a bar quite like this place! I really liked the cheesy decorations! I loved how there are so many places you can hang out and that there is an option for you to dance or relax at a booth or the bar with friends. It can get a little crowded but what's fun about being in an empty bar? I really liked the downstairs bar in the basement. But the poor bartender was all by herself down there so it took a while to get drinks. I will definitely be going back!

Great service! Ok food. Delicious key lime pie!  I recently moved to Pittsburgh and I don't know if its just the east side of the country or just me but it seems every time I go out to eat I always get horrible service. But this is my first restaurant experience in the burgh where the service was absolutely wonderful!! From the hostess to the server they were so friendly and did everything a person in the customer service business should do. I wish I had something better to say about the food but the truth is I have had much better at worse restaurants. But I'll definitely go back for dessert and maybe try something else on the menu.

Alright although they had a fabulous selection of beer, the food was not to my liking....  I was very intimidated by the portions which are comparable to the size of a human head, so I decided to play it safe with a salad...BIG mistake. The salad was served in the exact same bowl my family and I use to serve salad at Thanksgiving dinner NO JOKE! It was filled to the brim with salad covered in tons of cheese, too much dressing, and less than extraordinary chicken.   So basically I had 3-5 bites and was done just because I was so grossed out. I wish the server would have mentioned the salad was big enough to feed the whole table and the one next to us. But he just completely ignored the fact I didn't eat any of it. But everyone else at my table seemed to enjoy their gargantuan meals. I will not be going back to eat there.

Loved this place!  Reminds me of the clubs where I'm from (Scottsdale, AZ)! I love the set up how the bar is separate from the dance floor and the tables are on the sides or upstairs. Pretty good music, I could do without some of the top 40 songs I hear 5 times a day on the radio already but the DJ made sure to throw some house and good hip hop in there as well. Drink prices were average for a club. Probably around $6-9 depending on what you want. Highly suggest if you're looking to dance and have a good time!

Finally I found a good place to get waxed!!! Judit was fantastic! I told her exactly what I wanted and she listened!! I also thought the pricing was very fair.  Beware! The receptionist is SOO rude. For example I called and asked if Judit had anything available for Monday afternoon, thinking she would give me some options instead she sighed and said well what time and I said umm I don't like 11:00. She then laughed obnoxiously in my face for an uncomfortably long time because she thought it was the funniest thing in the world that I said I wanted afternoon but then changed my time to 11am GOD FORBID. So unprofessional.    But besides the receptionist, I really like this place.

Ahhhh I love this place!! Definitely a must if you're visiting Pittsburgh or a resident! The beer serving are huge!!! I was having a pretty good time after the first huge glass! And those soft pretzels are to die for!   We sat on the patio, such a beautiful view out there! Love the atmosphere and how freaking big the place is! Definitely perfect for big groups of people! Great if you actually want to go out and have conversation with people.   I also saw a lot of families in there so it looks like it can be enjoyable for almost everyone (maybe not young children)! Highly recommend!

This is my favorite place on Mill!!! It's super nice, classy and its the least likely place to get thrown up on. The set up is great, I love how everything is seperated. You can hang out at one of the two bars or two patios, and decently sized dance floor! I really like the watering hole bathrooms! They always play good music! Amazing tequila selection. Definitely a must if you are going to Mill.

Erin helped me design my dream wedding invitations. I found the perfect invitations on etsy but the seller couldn't change the color scheme to what I wanted. So I went to Be In Love Designs and Erin made even more perfect invitations to match my color scheme! I received so many compliments on them! She also designed custom stamps through zazzle. My only complaint was that the white background on the stamp did not match the white on the address label and I wish I went with the smaller stamps. But I'm pretty sure I was the only one that noticed that.  She also made a seating chart that matched my invitations perfectly (with only a weeks notice!). I highly recommend this company. I'm so happy with how everything turned out. Very high quality and easy to work with.
