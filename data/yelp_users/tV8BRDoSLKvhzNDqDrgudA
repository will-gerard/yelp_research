This place is amazing!  We came here to celebrate a job promotion. I called ahead and reserved a table in the basement - the best part of the restaurant.   We used the valet and walked down stairs and were sat immediately. We were given a table in the corner. I felt like I was eating in a wine cellar. The ambiance and lighting were awesome.  Service was spot on.   The timing of drinks and food was perfect.  We started off with cocktails and the fresh artichoke dip. The full flavor of the artichokes was amazing. A lot of places cover up the flavor with cheese and salt. This dip set a benchmark.  I ordered the Adovada. The pork was seasoned well and had great New Mexico flavors.  My boyfriend ordered the seafood and he loved it.  Dessert was equally flavorful.   We will definitely be back.

This place is horrible!   I had to wait at the front desk for about five minutes before anybody showed up to take my order. I called back and one of the cooks said someone be up shortly. I ordered the mini bucket of hot wings to go.  I was surprised when they said it would only take five minutes to make the wings but didn't think anything of it until I got home.  I opened the container and had some of the smallest wings I've ever eaten. There was hardly any meat on them and the meat that was was on the bones was dry as plywood. The ranch container was only half-full and even the carrots were dry and warm. There was very little sauce on the wings and it was gritty and tasted like water and chili powder.   I have been to Long Wongs in Phoenix before and it was great. This place on Stapley was NOTHING like it.

I hope today was just an off day for Blanco. I met a friend here tonight at 7 for a drink. We have been here before a couple of times but it has been a while.   We sat at the bar and I was a bit surprised that it was as empty as it was. Especially with Game 7 of the NBA finals going on.   We ordered a drink and some queso. Before the drinks arrived we both looked at each other and mentioned how warm it was. It was 120* out today and a cold drink was just what the doctor ordered. Well, the doctor must have called out sick. Along with the AC guy. Yep. We mentioned the temperature to the bartender and he kind of chuckled and said 'well, our AC is broken. That's when we asked for the check and cashed out.   My Tito's and Tonic was weak. There was only half an inch of melted ice in the top of the glass and the drink was slightly room temperature. Their ice machine must have gone out with the AC.

Ok. I'm pretty picky with 5 star reviews. Especially  when it comes to a restaurant that is more of a chain or franchise:  I just don't do it. However, this particular Mellow Mushroom feels like home. We are here almost every Friday night.   Their pizza is always consistent.  Their jerked wings are our favorite. We get them every time.  Their beer taps are always changing and they always have new beer to try.   These three things would earn them 4 stars. Consistency is key for me. Good food can be experienced at a lot of places, but having the same, consistent food, visit after visit is less common.   The reason this particular location gets 5 stars is because of the service. We ALWAYS sit at the bar. We have never actually sat in the dining room. The reason this feels like 'Home' is because we see the same three people behind the bar every time. They know our names. They know how we order. They know what we order. They recommend beers based on what they know we like. They carry on a conversation. They hustle. And they have fun!  Marlena, Kara and Dustin are there because they enjoy what they do and they do it well. That is hard to find in most restaurants. A team that works together and works for the customers is a team that creates an experience worthy of a 5 Star Review. And they are worthy of 5 Stars.

My First time there was for lunch.  The food was fantastic. The service was sub par. Waitress disappeared for a good while. I ordered my pizza without mushrooms and it came out covered in them. The waitress who took our order delivered us the food and was clueless.

As soon as we parked in the unassuming strip mall and got out of the truck, I knew by the smell of the air we were in for a treat. The onsite smoker for this barbecue joint had the air full of mouth watering flavors.   When we walked inside I was a little in shock. I expected a typical 'strip mall restaurant' but was surprised to find a restaurant that could easily be found in Scottsdale Quarters. The dining room tables, all stainless steel with steel 'patio style chairs,' were warmed up with dark tufted leather high back booths and linen wrapped silverware. The lighting was perfect and accentuated the reclaimed wood and high shelves covered in prohibition period art and decor.   I was excited to see a one page menu. Food on one side and drinks on the other. We were greeted quickly by Stacey, a server that clearly enjoyed her job and had a strong knowledge of the menu.   I started off with the Catdaddy Old Fashioned (made with moonshine instead of bourbon) which was light but full of flavor. Typically an old fashioned feels a little thicker or heavier in the mouth but this was light. My boyfriend said it felt like drinking Dr Pepper (that's not a criticism for him).   For an appetizer we had the Kitchen Sink Guacamole. It is a chunkier guac that has pieces of Avacado and nopales. I was most excited to see they provided enough chips to actually finish the appetizer. Nothing's worse than being left with a dish of guacamole and nothing to eat it with.   For dinner we took our server's suggestion and ordered the BBQ Sampler for Two which came with 5 meets and coleslaw. The coleslaw was fantastic. Perfectly and lightly dressed bite sized pieces of crisp cabbage and vegetables.  Ribs:  two ribs came with the plate and they were my favorite. The meat fell easily off the bone with each bite. Brisket:  about six slices came with the platter. The perfect amount to share. It was juicy and tender with great flavor on its own.  Hot links:  two links with the plate and the experience was a surprise. I typically don't order hot links at a bbq joint so I'm glad I got the sampler. The crisp bite and slight heat notes at the end made this a great surprise.  Pulled Pork:  this was served sauce less but was amazingly moist with slightly crisp ends. The flavor was spot on and the plate came with a generous portion of about 1 cup.  Turkey: a great way to finish off the plate. It came with four thin but meaty slices. The meat was smoked pink and very tender.  Served with the platter were three sauces: traditional, spicy and Dr Pepper. They were all great but we were both partial to the Dr Pepper sauce. It also came with fresh (what seemed to be hand made) tortillas. We suggest trying all the meats as they arrive and then getting creative and making tacos with the different meats, sauces and coleslaw. Every bite is a different and a new experience.   For sides we ordered the Smokes Sweet Corn with Chulula Lime Butter and the Mac & Cheese. The corn was crisp and flavorful, although I couldn't taste the lime. The chulula was great on the corn. The Mac & Cheese was gooey and cheesy and house made. It's a must.    Overall the experience was great. The service was good. My only complaints were, 1. My water glass sat empty for quite a while. And 2.  It would have been nice to have a warm wet linen or even a wet-nap to wash off my sticky hands from the ribs.   We look forward to sitting at the trendy but unsuspecting bar on our next visit.

We had an hour before we had to be at a Rattler's game. I've been to the place across the street at least 20 times but I've never even noticed this place. My buddy had been here once before and recommended the pizza.   The restaurant has a very 'urban' vibe. The server was very friendly but the service felt a little abrupt.   I started out with a craft beer in a bottle. No taps here. And spent some time looking over the menu. All the pizzas looked unique and different. After going back and forth between two, I took the recommendation of the server and ordered the Dolce Diavolo. I was a little worried about the honey, but the slight sweetness balanced out the spice of the Calabrian Chilis.   The toppings were used sparingly and allowed for a different flavor profile with each bite. The basil was the perfect note to finish off the slightly charred flavor of the crust.   I ended up getting the 'Sour Elder' as a cocktail and loved it!  I was expecting it to be sweeter than it was, but was pleasantly surprised at the sour notes that shone through.

It's nice to have an option so close because there's not much around this neighborhood in terms of restaurants. Unfortunately it's not a great option. The food is just OK, nothing special. The customer service is probably the biggest thing lacking at this place. Whoever came up with their operational systems was clearly high or under the influence of something. Forget about ordering food while you're in the bar. You have to walk up to the front counter yourself, order, pay for it and then walk back to the bar. They're trying to mix a fast food and dine-in restaurant - but they do it horribly.   They don't have a full bar. Just cheap wine that's overpriced, warm drought beer they poor with a three inch head and a few can options of local breweries.   Drive a few miles in either direction and you can find something better, I'm sure.

The inside of the restaurant is pretty awesome. I felt like we walked into a lodge in the Pacific NorthWest. We just went in for drinks. Steak 44 was a little too busy and we wanted something a little quieter. I have a seafood allergy so stayed away from the food, but the drinks were fantastic.  Their drinks remind me of the cocktails I like to order at The Windsor. We were there late and I've read reviews about their reverse happy hour but the bartender didn't mention it and our drinks were full price. Regardless, we will be back. The experience was great.

I was really excited to see a Mellow Mushroom going in down the street from me. I have become a regular at the Happy Valley location on Friday nights so having one close was going to be great.  Turns out, it's horrible!!  I've been 3 times now and it's been consistently a disaster and embarrassment.  The first time I went, I sat at the bar. The bar staff seemed clueless. It took 20 minutes to get my app and the bartenders were extremely inattentive. Even though there were 4 of them and about the same number of customers.  I figured it was because the restaurant was only a week old and the staff was still learning.  The second time I brought friends. They know the place is one of my favorites and we're excited to go because they have never been. I was so embarrassed. They kept looking at me and saying 'Really?  You like this place??'  (They know I'm picky).  So we sat there for about 30 minutes eating the disappointing food and watching the staff. Which seemed to all be smoking the 'mellow mushroom' and in state of bewilderment. At one point I asked the waitress for a bottle of OMission (gluten free beer) and she told me they just stopped selling it yesterday. I was shocked. I verified again that she heard me correctly. She said we do have a replacement that's great.  So I said 'I'll try it' and she brought me out a draft beer. I drank it and it tasted SUPER 'wheaty'. When she came back I asked if she was sure I had the gluten free beer and she said 'I don't know if we have any of those'. I asked for a manger. Turns out they DO have OMissiom and the waitress was just clueless. She laughed at thought it was funny. I didn't.  Third strike out. Yesterday I went in at 5:00. I asked the bartender about happy hour and she said 'all the beer and all the appetizers are half price'. Great. I found a beer I wanted and ordered it and she said 'oh. That list is from May 30th and its out of date. We don't have that beer anymore. I asked for an update list and she said that was the most up to date list they had and it wasn't very accurate but she could help. So I asked for a recommendation and she brought me a beer. It was good and I ordered wings. My favorite from the other location. They were luke warm and super 'wet'. They also came out with celery and carrots. The carrots looked like rabbit droppings. They were those small carrots that come in the bag for children and are shaved down to little finger sizes. Well these were shaved down to rabbit dropping size. The other bartender noticed I had stopped eating them and asked if they were ok.   I explained I was a little bummed out the food and experience was so different from the other location on Happy Valley and on Mill. I told him about the outdated beer list and room temp wings. He was a good guy. He attempted to make it up and brought out fresh wings. He said the beer list wasn't out of date, there was just one beer that wasn't offered anymore. He then asked if I wanted another drink and I ordered one. The wings came back out and were the same as the first batch so I just ate them, knowing what they should taste like and telling myself I wasn't coming back.  Long story short, I got my bill and both beers showed up as names other than what I ordered and were full priced. As well as the second app I ordered. He said the first drink wasn't on happy hour. And they don't actually put in the drinks that are ordered, they just put in standard drinks because that's how their computers work.   I just shook my head gave him my card and said, 'Fine. Here. I'm never coming back.'   A manager ended up coming back and she comped my apps. I explained my concerns and the difference in experiences. She said it was a new restaurant and everybody was still in training. They have been opened a month. It's unfortunate they are a disaster. I told her I fully intended on paying for what I ate and drank, I just expected happy hour prices. She said she understood and it was her call to discount my check so heavily. Her and the guy bartender said they wanted me to come back and try them again and that it would be better next time. He was a nice guy. None of my frustration was with him. I tipped him very well and said I wished he could take the full tip because the young female bartender was a disaster but I understand tip share.   Unfortunately, I don't think I can go back to this location for a long time. It's disappointing because it's so close. However, the three experiences have been consistently horrible. Good thing Chick-fil-a and In-N-Out are across the street. Ha!
