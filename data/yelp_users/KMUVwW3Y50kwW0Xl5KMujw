I love this place. The atmosphere, the food, the drink, the music...it's perfect for date night when you want a little romance, or for that after work kickback spot. It's my go to when I want to feel completely relaxed because I know they're going to take care of me.

We came here after the other Mexican place we wanted to go to was closed and ended up having a great dinner! I went in with no expectations since it was so last minute, but loved all of it. The waitress was personable and had some solid recommendations, the margarita was awesome, we loved our dishes and the atmosphere was nice for a quick little date night.  I had an enchilada and taco, my fianc√©e had a burrito and both were delicious. We will definitely be back.

In the middle of a monsoon, trying to get home from the airport, my car won't start. We get it jumped and head here where we had the most amazing service from Donald who took his time with us, provided incredible assistance and knowledge, and made sure that when we left we were not only in a safe car but also in better spirits. No one wants to deal with a dead battery but he definitely made the whole experience better. My husband and I want to personally thank Donald for what he did for us tonight. I'm not sure when I'll need to come back but knowing that he's in the Autozone brand, we will definitely be returning customers in the future. Thanks, Donald!!

Oh, darling. Let me tell you about this place. To be honest I may never have gone in (it's a bit off my path and next to a gas station) had it not been for my husband and his family. Sicilian, they want to honor everything Italian and as accountants, they've also done work for the family who owns this restaurant. When they brought it up the first time, I rolled with it. Honestly, I'm not one to turn down carbs and hot cheese, so off we went.   Delicious is an understatement. Everything I've ever had has been amazing. At this point, I ask them to bring me whatever they would want to eat and every time it gets better. We've even done large dinner parties (rehearsal dinners of 40+ people) and everything was fresh, hot, and wonderful. Most of the time though, it's our cute little date spot. We order a bottle of wine and enjoy ourselves there.   I think one of my favorite parts is that it's family owned and they all work there. Who doesn't love seeing a family work together?!   Weekend nights, there's going to be a wait. I promise it's worth it, but if you'd rather you can also call in your order to go and pick it up in the back where you don't have to wait in a crowd.   And if you're starving, get a calzone. They're the size of a dinosaur egg and will feed you for a week.

For whatever reason, the AC gods have not blessed me with the chance to live in cool temperatures during Arizona summers. Thankfully, we found Jon through a family referral and he has saved our butts on more than one last-minute occasion.   Any time we've had to call on him, he's happily come our way in a timely manner. Jon clearly takes pride in the work he does and services he offers. He works hard and with a smile on his face. We've also called through their office to schedule, and Patti has been both incredibly courteous and helpful.  We are grateful for the work he does, how knowledgable he is, how quickly he's able to resolve our cooling problems, and how easy it is to understand what he's doing. It's nice being walked through what's happening.   This is a locally owned, family business, so there is also the satisfaction knowing that you're working with people in your community. As crappy as it is to have our AC go out in the summer months, we stress less knowing Jon can, and will, fix it in no time.

Dear Jeff, you've converted me.   I have been in a makeup rut, and slightly (okay, very) homely looking lately so I went in with the hope of finding a new lip gloss or foundation, just something to make my face worthy of looking at. I was blown away with the service I got tonight. I'm really not one for sales associates in stores, in fact, I usually run in the opposite direction and pray they don't see me. Jeff caught me though and I'm happy he did.   He took his time and helped me find what I was looking for, made me feel comfortable telling him how average I was feeling, and made sure I walked out with all the tools and make up I wanted to face the world. He didn't sell me on anything I didn't need, simply made sure I had exactly what I wanted. Sephora is lucky to have him and I will definitely be back there because of him!   They use this face scanning machine thing that matched my skin tone to brands that could match my color, then he worked through my skin type and the finish I wanted and price range I wanted to stick to. Jeff tested a few options on my face before I decided on a foundation I liked and then he did my whole face. I got matched with a brand I have been walking by for years. I sure do feel pretty right now.   I've never had service at Sephora like this before and was happy I walked into this one tonight.

Well this is a fun little cluster. With no communication between employees and no system for ticketing in order to identify our items, we've now had our items lost for more than a week now. We have stopped in and called and left our contact information several times with no follow up or concern. I get it, it's just a dry cleaner and there are dozens of them around, but this one has our clothing and this one doesn't care that it's missing. Every time we call we have to reintroduce our situation as no one has heard about it yet. I have no clue how to get this resolved at this point, I just hope to be able to advise you to take your business elsewhere.

Update: a manager was supposed to call me (going on nearly two weeks) and I've received no such call. I reached out to the store again and they offered me store credit and a canned apology. Her reasoning for the manager not calling me was simply that "she probably hasn't been in." Our items are simply lost. I hate to have no resolution to this other than we're out clothing we trusted this business with but now we know. Please take your business anywhere else so you don't have to go through this.

This is our weekend morning go-to. We are always greeted with friendly service, great food, delicious coffee, and a vibe that I totally enjoy.   I really appreciate their selection of milk substitutions (almond, coconut, soy). Starbucks could learn a thing or two from the Roost.   I hope this local business sticks around for a long while.

I'm obsessed!!! I've been coming to this location for five months now and every time it gets better. There are two sides to this: the business model itself and then the trainers.   The business is great and as with anything, you get what you put in. I've gotten amazing results, using the online scheduling and booking in advance. Even when I call in for a last minutes class, they're helpful in getting me in. I've never done the same workout twice and feel fortunate to have this personal group training model in a place I can get to. Driving from North Scottsdale where I work to Gilbert where I live is a nightmare during traffic, so this location breaks that up for me. The workout is a great way to end my work day and to get out of traffic for a bit.   Then there is the staff. I've been to a few different locations now, but these guys are amazing. Every trainer I've worked with has been attentive to my shoulder injury and offers modifications when necessary. They are motivational. They remember me. The sales associates are always friendly and helpful.   I've always struggled with gyms because of how people might be perceiving me. Never here. The staff at OTF Tempe care and want to do right by me and my goals. I feel really lucky to have found this place.

This is my favorite nail salon in the east valley! the staff are professionals, who take their time, appreciate the work they do, and have always been fun to be around! For me I want to know my business is welcome at a salon, and I've always been treated as such here. The icing on the cake of course is their work; it's top quality!! every single time! Bob is my favorite technician, but I've been pleased with everyone I've had. if you're looking for a little pampering, I suggest getting one of the seasonal pedicures. They are an hour long and sooo relaxing!

I'm so excited to have amazing Thai food in Gilbert! The owner is in her business working, she is involved with her customers, and she makes each experience a personal one. The food is killer. Every dish we've tried has been delicious! It's my new go-to, I-don't-want-to-cook, Panda-Express-is-only-for-hangover restaurant.
