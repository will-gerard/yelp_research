I had a hankering for Indian food and had been meaning to try India Palace. I grabbed a friend and we headed on our way.   As others have said, the neighborhood is a bit sketchy. The restaurant is nice inside and looks recently renovated. The staff was extremely friendly and seated us right away.   The food is good. Really good. They immediately brought us papadum and a few various sauces. We ordered some garlic naan (delicious) and the Bombay fish (decent).  We ordered chicken tikka masala and Reshami chicken along with two orders of basmati rice. I ordered the tikka masala as spicy as they make it. It was spicy but, I wanted tears and didn't get any. It was still delicious. It's the best Indian food I've had in Las Vegas during the 5 years I've lived here.  Great service, great atmosphere, and great food. Go!

Durants is old school cool. The lighting, red wallpaper, and wood paneling are the perfect combination. It's not Scottsdale sheik, it's above it. If Sinatra wanted a great cocktail, he would come here.   Guys order a real drink like a martini up or a Manhattan and you won't be disappointed. They have a great wine selection and even offer the majority of it by the glass.   The food is unassuming, but good. Your steak isn't going to be overdressed or or over cooked, but just right. The oysters, when in season are almost the best in town.

Oh FEZ. If you had reproductive parts I would try to impregnate you. We rolled in early one Saturday morning still in the midst of the previous evenings drunk. We were the first customers of the day, but the staff was friendly and ready to roll.   After being seated we ordered some cocktails. I had the Bloody Mary, which was good, but a little heavy on the Worcestershire. My breakfast companion had a grapefruit vodka concoction (g-spot) that was pretty tasty. She asked for extra vodka and they willingly complied.   We went with the "best egg white omelette you'll ever have" and the "FEZ frittata". They were both outstanding. I asked our server to add some sort of meat to my omelette and it came out over flowing with bacon. He even brought an extra vodka shot to our table to top off the young ladies g-spot.....I just got that.   FEZ is too good for a one meal stand. I anxiously await our next meeting.

I just moved back to Phoenix from Las Vegas, so I get to experience the magic that is Fez whenever I want now!   I've taken to going Tuesday nights for Tini' Tuesday when they offer $3 martini's. There's not a better deal in the valley on Tuesday night. The Fez burger is an oral explosion with honey molasses BBQ sauce, cinnamon pears, and crispy onion strings!   You'll find me on the patio all summer!

I love video games. I grew up playing Atari, Nintendo, Sega. These are the devices that consumed my childhood. I had high expectations for the Pinball Hall Of Fame.   I passed the building twice on Tropicana. It's very nondescript.   Walking in transported me back in time 25 years. It reminded me of the arcades of the 80's. It is about pinball, but don't let that fool you. They have a lot of video games and the best kept air hockey table I've ever played on.   It was busy for a Thursday night and the crowd seemed to be made up of a lot of regulars. If loyalty is a sign you're doing things right, then PBHOF can check that box.   It's a fun place to pass a few hours. Completely different from anything else in Vegas and it won't break the bank. Have fun recapturing your youth.

Wow! The Olive on Monday is a happening place. The restaurant is setup with 3 different rooms. The hookah lounge is the largest and coolest of the rooms. The service was a little slow, but our waitress had just enough sass to make the experience.   We started with martinis and the appetizer sampler. The martinis had waaaay to much vermouth. We mentioned something to our server and she said it looked like the bartender over did it when she watched him make them. It made me laugh. They quickly changed our drinks with out a fuss. The food here is very casual. You're not going to find a pretentious or over dressed plate on the menu. The appetizers do seem to be a touch better than the sandwiches and plates. The food isn't what makes this place. The band and hookah are.   The hookah prices look like they've gone up a touch from some other reviews, but it's still amongst the best deals in town for hookah. We tried the Yahalla at the recommendation of our server, but saw some really interesting combos. I'm going with "The Crazy Mexican" next time. It's blueberry, pumpkin, and mint. I can't wait.   The band came on about 8:40 and really delivered. I'm not sure that they would be successful in a lot venues, but they really work at The Olive. We we're highly entertained!   I'm coming back next week with a big group to smoke hookah, snack on some appetizers, and listen to the band. I might even chat up some of the regulars.

I stayed here last week at the recommendation of a friend. I needed a place for Friday and Saturday thought it would be nice to hangout around Old Town for the weekend.   The location is good, price was great, lobby's nice, room is trendy, but you could see where they cut some corners.   I had a friend that was going to be arriving at the hotel before, so I arranged for her to be able to check in with the front desk. They had me fax over my credit card and driver's license and assured me she would be able to check in no problem. They failed to see that I had an authorization already on file and made her supply a credit card.   The walls are thin. I could very clearly hear the people in the room next door. Match this up with me getting yelled at in the elevator by the overnight front desk guy because there we're some other people riding up and down in the elevator. It sullied my overall experience.   They also authorized my card for an additional $75 on top of the room cost and incidentals.

This was a disaster from the start. My date and I met in front of the entrance to the restaurant. A customer walked out front to smoke and one of the owners/partners/managers comes out and yells at him "This isn't Tijuana." "You can't smoke and drink out here." He was holding a cigarette the entire time.   The restaurant itself doesn't set the atmosphere of a Mexican restaurant or anything remotely related to pinup culture either. The design is trying to be more like a nightclub or ultra lounge. It's a mishmash of chaos with no discernible direction. The bar is nice, but our table seemed to be the wrong shape for the booth, and you could still see uncovered electrical outlets in the wall. Not impressed at all.   There were 12 people standing behind the bar and no one was really doing anything. It almost seemed intimidating ordering at the bar. Our server was very friendly and next to the OK food was the only thing that kept this from being a 1-star review.   Our order was handled incorrectly (kitchens fault) and the busser seemed a bit over zealous to clear our plates. They were still half covered with food. The food itself was again decent, but nothing remarkable. The margarita's were good.  The holographic dancer/mariachi/dj display is strange and seems completely out of place. Then again, it might just fit right in amongst the disaster that is Lolita's Cantina.

I'm a fat kid at heart. I love food. I would eat eat cupcakes and onion rings for breakfast if I could afford the crane to move me about. Since I cannot, I'm always looking for healthy lunch spots in Henderson. Teriwoki I thought fit the bill.   I was greeted by a lovely pint sized Asian woman and an even smaller menu. They serve two things. Torn between the fried rice and teriyaki bowl, I went with the rice. I opted for brown rice ($1.50 up-charge) and chicken. She explained they use twice as much rice with the brown rice hence the up-charge. $9.50 and 10 minutes later I have leave with container packed with food. They loaded the container, but I feel like they should for the price.   I anxiously take my first bite and am soon greeted by blandness. It had all the climax of the "Cloverfield" movie. I ate my lunch and had leftovers. I opted to throw them out. It wasn't worth saving.   There are better alternatives in the neighborhood.

I kissed girls in elementary school. Junior high too. I even dated a few girls early in high school. Then one summer evening I kissed a girl at Denny Dunn Park. My world would never be the same. It was like nothing that had ever happened to me before.   I ate lunch at San Francisco Sourdough Eatery today. It's exactly 56 steps from my desk. I've had this day circled on my calendar for months. I've watched the build out take place. I stalked the website. I went as far as to commit my first order to memory. I was prepared for the life changing moment this time. I wouldn't be destiny's pawn twice.   I took a casual stroll through the front door and was warmly greeted by the scent of sourdough, fresh cookies, and fate. I recited my order from memory. This was happening. I felt the jolt from that warm summer air.   Covered in a haze of hunger and excitement, I prepared to bite in to my long awaited meal. I've never eaten unicorn, but I would imagine it tastes very similar to the turkey and salami sandwich I've just finished. The bread is soft and chewy with a nice crunch to the crust. The meats are fresh sliced and generously served. The veggies are fresh.  I'll never be able to recapture that exact moment in the park, but I'll eagerly be waiting for lunch tomorrow.

I really want to like you Wy Knot, but alas you won't let me. Your food is delicious and I appreciate that you make everything fresh and it sometimes takes a little longer. I love the baked pancakes.   Here's the deal though, your service is consistently terrible. It's pure chaos. I've been in three times now and it's always the same. It's easier to get a cup of coffee in the middle of The Sahara. While my food is taking a little longer, maybe stop back by to say "hi" or ask if I need anything. I always go with a local business whenever possible, but after three tries, I just can't let it go anymore. It's Knot me, it's you.
