Food is great for a small snack.  I wouldn't go there if you want a full dinner.  Awesome deck to hang out.

Do not buy high end appliances from this company.  I bought many from them and on one order we had 2 defective Viking appliances where they refused to do anything to help us.  They also hung up on my wife and mother in law multiple times that was trying to figure this out.  Don't be swayed by there low prices.  It is not always worth it.

Roadrunner is great!  They installed some really modern windows in a project I am working on in PV.  They found solutions while the framing for the windows weren't done correctly.  Visit their showroom they have good displays of work they have done.

Scott is a great guy and made my 1970 Bronco look great.  He came out and did the wash and wax.

This company is great.  They know how to really make a steak and there food is well priced.  I have been to other steak houses in Scottsdale and steaks cost around $50.  Here you will get the same thing for around $20 to $25.  The service is usually great too.  I have been to this restaurant 10 to 15 times over the last couple years and will continue to go.

David is great.  He knows what he is doing and has great stories.  I have been going to this salon for about a year and he knows how to cut my hair.  I have really thick and course hair so it's hard to find someone good.  The  place also looks great inside big glass garage doors that are open when it is nice out.

Do not use this company.  I own an electrical company and have been trying to collect payment for work we have done with this company month ago.  We have sent multiple email's and call to try to collect and have still not been paid in full.  BE AWARE!!!

Love the potato soup and blt.  Also have great breakfast sandwiches.  You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.

Honest company.  I am an investor and use them form some of my A/C and heating needs.  They aren't the cheapest but they are reliable and do good work.

Roger does a great job servicing my pools.  He services 8 or more pools for me at a time and I can trust him to do honest work.  I have been through 3 or more pool service companies in the last five years and Roger has been with me for 2 year and I plan on continuing to use him in the future.  Before him the pool companies I hired skipped visits, didn't use the right chemicals and even stole from my properties.

I have quite a few rentals and have really liked working with Justin.  I have used him for appliance repair for 6 months or a year.  He comes out and gives me an honest evaluation and pricing.  If it is cheaper to buy a new appliance than the repair, he is alway honest and tells me.  I have had bad luck with most appliance repair companies (crazy pricing and dishonesty).  I never worry about that with Justin.
