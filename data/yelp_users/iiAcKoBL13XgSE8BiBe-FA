Amazing... Totally amazing. The raisin bread and croissant were two of the best breads I've had. Wonderful scallops. Soup wasn't listed as cold and although the taste was good I didn't like the temperature. Service was amazing!! Desert was to die (we had ice cream in some type of bread). Only 4 stars because there were no vegan or vegetarian entree options.

Amazing pizza... Corn, veggie, avocado?! How do I choose!?!? Amazing crust. Amazing pesto. Amazing quinoa salad. Amazing !!!! Nutella gelato. 4 stars because the service. It's well known the girls on the order side don't have the best ...er...customer service. But I will eat their attitudes and lack of menu knowledge with an avocado pizza.

Oh postino... I have to limit my time here, otherwise it would be daily. I'm a vegetarian so I always get the artichoke bruschetta and the bruschetta with pesto- lucky me if corn is the seasonal. Champagne...rose....bellinis. (Insert more good things here)

gave yard house a second try and it was much improved!!!! I love how many options they have. I got the tofu lettuce wraps and the sauces were amazing. I also gave the ahi salad a second try and although I was so full, it was incredible. My favorite ahi salad around!!! I'm really happy I went back. My date also loved his chicken noodle soup. the pineapple mule was good but you have to love pineapple. It wasn't super sweet which was nice. Thanks yard house!!! Will be back

Vegan post- Came here last night and my experience was much better than usual. The waitress was wonderful which has been out of the ordinary in the past. I got the rocket man with added corn and no cheese and it was to die. The prices aren't bad considering you can split a pizza or have leftovers the next day. The drinks are okay, a little light with the bottle I think. Didn't get the gelato this time, but it's amazing!

Olive and ivy remains my favorite restaurant. Their menu changes with the season, but the ahi with snap peas and the cannelloni sweet potato pasta ..my mouth is watering as I type. Their bread and pesto is incredible. They have a few cocktails I really love, and the view is killer.

Top 3 restaurants in Phoenix, nothing else can compare. I do wish they had more vegan options -- I'm a vegan because I dislike meat and cheese, why would I want fake cheese? I can't imagine anyone wanting that. Regardless, I pick around it and smile for days

Hannys is so beautiful. They're drinks are fun, but pricey. I think it's acceptable they charge these prices, but do wish hey had a happy hour. I've never been a big fan of the pizza, but the atmosphere makes up for it.

Honestly does it get any better? I just got back from Italy from 2 weeks and nothing compared to one bite of postinos. My favorites are pesto with corn (when they have corn) and artichoke. Die hard fan and lover

This place makes me so happy I wanna burst! The owners are the sweetest, and the instructors are the bomb.com. The only thing I wish is that the studio was cooler, but everything else makes it worth it. It feels like family.

Ummmm! As a vegetarian, I'm embarrassed I hadn't been here yet and it's a mile from my house!!! I've seen it but figured it was just pastries and didn't have a full menu. I can be an espresso snob, and this was amazing! I stayed and studied for a few hours. I also got the bean, potato, and cashew cheese burrito. It was very good but carb heavy- next time I'll see if they can add greens and tofu. Overall, I'm so sad I hadn't come here before. I will definitely be back- they have alcohol too! The only thing that bothered me was that they didn't have a matcha soy latte, or at least the guy couldn't tell me exactly what was in their version (he said it had dairy). Maybe that's a really fancy drink, and I just wasn't aware.

This place is pretty good. I had a veggie sandwich about 6 months ago I really liked. More recently I came last night and got the quesadilla. It was alright- split it with my friend. Pretty average, but I think that is why you don't order a quesadilla at a sandwich place. The artichoke dip we got was AMAZING. The chips are to die. The beach bellini(sub vodka) is really good, and the beer selection is awesome. One weird thing- a fly flew in my drink and the waiter brought it back filled to around the same level? I guess that's fair, but our whole group just thought it was really weird and kind of poor judgement- like... Are you sure you didn't just take the fly out!? You really can't refill that 1/4 for customer satisfaction? Oh well, would still come back.

Vegan post- this place is the ultimate. The salsa bar is on another level, the avocado is my favorite. The quesadillas might be the best meal I've ever had. I got no cheese, add beans to quesadilla. The rice is the best rice I've ever had, easily. The nopales tacos are also amazing.

Ugh. Bad. Requested no onions or dressing and it came with both. Waitress wasn't around for 15 minutes (empty drinks) and I was too hungry to wait for her to fix it. When I finally did see her she took my order and ignored my date. Needless to say she lost money we would've spent on more drinks. The drinks were good, though.

Disliked the calamari...way too heavy on the deep fry. With mayo? I like traditional asian calamari. The spring rolls were great :)

I had never come here because I don't love this type food in comparison to the restaurants across the street. My boyfriend dragged me in and I'm so glad he did. I got the veggie burger which I wasn't thrilled with until it arrived! This had pinto beans, rice, avocado, sweet potato!! I asked for the rye bun. Best veggie burger I ever had. The drink was also one of the best I ever had. Get the mint green tea drink!!!! Our waiter was Jacob and he was phenomenal. Also....the broccoli is fabulous 10/10

Green is REALLY great for non vegans, vegans who miss meat, or transitioning vegans. Personally I would like to see more seiten and falafel on the menu. All the fried food and fake meats/mayo/fake animal product really turned me off, but that said, it is called green American food so I think it's just my bored taste buds and dislike of meat and American food. I get the peanut or curry bowl expecting thai food quality, and it's just not that. It's a substitution for real meat and at that they do a decent job, I'm just not into it.

North...another beautiful atmosphere. Get the bread, soft, with a side of pesto. The calamari salad is good, I love the amount of spinach they put, but it's really more like a salad. The calamari is always a little tough. The artichoke is creamy and amazing. I've also had the ravioli which was wonderful. I need to try the pizza next.

1st time dining at crudo. Our waiter was awesome, very knowledgable. I wish they had more vegan and vegetarian options, but I sort of expected that. Out waiter said that if we call ahead next time they could make something vegan. We both got the 3 for $35 options, started with the bread w parm oil and had 4 (amazing- get the jalape√±o or violet femme) drinks between the 2 of us. I started with the "farmer" which was a salad, sort of was hoping for more of the veggies I saw elsewhere on the menu (fingerlings, broccoli, etc) but it was fine. Next I got the albacore which was INCREDIBLE. I actually got goosebumps. Last I got the grilled squid with cannelloni beans, it was really good also, ate every bite. My date on the other hand was disappointed. He did love his first raw butterfish dish. Then he got the squid ink risotto which he disliked and felt was too heavy, I tried and and disliked it also. Last he let the waiter choose who got him bone marrow and brisket. He hated both. I'm only giving 4 starts because there was a 15 minute gap between courses, it was sort of ridiculous and awkward.

Got the ahi quinoa cakes which were to DIE for. The grilled peppers were also amazing. My coconut cream vodka was pretty good too. Really nice waitress. I couldn't order any of the entrees because I'm vegan except with ahi. I'm sure at a place this nice the chef would've made me something special but I hate to be a bug. I got the pasta and it was okay, I don't love tomato but I think anyone else would enjoy it. Would've liked some bread for the table.

DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR MONEY. I went to 13 sessions and neither tattoo is gone. Why? Because the company up and shut down their clinic in Arizona. They have offered no resolution after multiple emails and months of emailing back and fourth. Don't give them your money unless you want a half removed tattoo.

I hate to leave a review this bad but... Yikes!! Me and my friend got the kale salad w ahi. Our ahi was grey and very fishy smelling... Ahi shouldn't taste or smell fishy. We apologetically sent them back, as the fish was bad. My friend got salmon on hers and I got mine plain. Mind came with salmon (I hate it, even fishier). I felt too uncomfortable to say anything. I ate the few pieces of corn, couple nuts and 1 piece of avocado it was topped with. I paid for it because it was awkward. My friends liked their meat and cheese dishes, but I won't be back for food.

I was a little disappointed with the food here. I'm a vegetarian and didn't feel there was many exciting options for me. I got the salad with cornbread thinking there would be a piece or large chucks of cornbread...but it was a very sad iceberg lettuce and regular crouton salad, nothing special at all. We also got the broccoli with cheddar which was just that...something I could make myself. The brussel sprouts were amazing, and the rolls they give were to die for. My date got fish and he liked it a lot. I think it's overpriced for what we got. Not impressed. Service was amazing however. I'm sure if you were a meat eater you would love it. I also didn't like the teeny tables and how bright it was. It wasn't romantic and we could hear everyone else's conversations.

1000 percent obsessed with the Lee cocktail. And for that price! I've only eaten here a few times. I wish they had more exciting vegan options. The nachos a neighbor table had looked great.

Whoa... This place was a 180 from my last few visits. I had raved to friends as the best place in Phoenix for brunch, especially with all the very rare vegetarian options. I went for the sweet potato pancake, which is usually a semi sweet puffy heavenly plate of happiness. This time, they messed up and put the caramel on and had to take it back... About 10 minutes after everyone has cleaned their plates I got mine. I would've canceled it if we had been checked on more. The worst pancake arrived... A flat, sad regular pancake with chunks of sweet  potato. This was NOTHING like it has been in the past, I had two bites. The soyrizo was also horrible.. A mushy patty? The server knew that the food was bad as well as the service and apologized, but didn't offer to comp any of our uneaten food. Womp. The iced coffee is also not good, tastes like 5% coffee the rest water. It's weird because they even have a brochure about their special coffee. Anyways, I might be back because it used to be so good but definitely with low expectations. Snooze, what happened!?

This place wasn't bad but I thought it was way overpriced for what we got. 2 drinks and 2 pizzas and about $70 with tip. I prefer other selections in the area. Drinks were good, though.

The service is so good here. Beautiful drinks and beautiful bar. And beautiful food! Edamame corn fritters were amazing, loved the sauce. Avocado and tofu bao were great. Wish there was a peanut sauce! Liked the flavor of the corn ramen but don't love the consistency, I wish they had a vegan/vegetarian clear broth rather than a pur√©e type broth. Tofu chow mien was off the charts. Our server Bryce was so helpful. so veggie friendly it's almost overwhelming! Coming back always

Come here!!!!! I had never had a grilled cheese in my life, and it was amazing!!!! Cheap (in a good way) champagne. I also heard the coffee and donuts are amazing. Not my hood, but will definitely come back to try the red velvet waffles! Also, our waiter was amazing! The atmosphere was amazing! I hope this place picks up business, it really deserves it.

What!!! This place is insane. $3 margs??? Cactus tacos??? Vegans everywhere are crying in joy. I've been waiting for cactus tacos to come to Phoenix for years now- the black bean hasn't been cutting it. I really like the watermelon Marg (sub vodka), and the green salsa. The quest dip was not good, but it was free through yelp. The corn is fantastic. The service is not very good, but hopefully that will improve with time. Will come back 10/10

Had to bring this down to four stars. Went back for the third time yesterday and ... The food has only gotten better and the service has only gotten worse. It took our drinks 25 min to get to us!!! We ordered our drinks about 10 min before our food, and actually got our food before our drinks!? We ordered another drink as soon as our first arrived for fears of never getting another one. Our waters were empty non stop (this is how it always is here), and the waiter asked if we needed anything else three times... Each time we said yes the bill. I will still continue to come here because I know they are going to quick and the food is so amazing, but come on... Nearly half an hour for a pre made frozen margarita???

Not bad, not great. The fresh rolls did disappoint. I don't like the plastic wrap deal and I prefer mine with peanut sauce. The pad see ew was okay, they didn't add tofu like I asked. Good assortment of vegetables. This would be fine if it was cheaper, but for the price I won't be back.

What!!! I'm so disappointed. This was my first time at this location, and the service was top 3 worst I've ever had in my life. Only gave 2 starts not 1 because the pho was still consistently good( in line with the other location). Our drinks took about 10 min, which the waitress apologized for. I had to eye her down for everything- drinks, food, more food, the bill. Our "appetizer" of a spring roll came halfway after we had eaten our pho. What!? She left our many plates in front of us for the whole rest of our time there, and I actually had to ask her if she could take them away. There was never more than 4 or 5 individuals in the whole restaurant, I have no idea why the food or drinks took so long and why she was so inattentive. I found some weird non-food string in my pho, and was given 1 and 1/2 tofu steaks, the 1/2 looked like someone had bit off it. The whole place just felt dirty. It was surprising because the place on 7th street is soooo good and clean and has great service! Anyways, I will definitely not come back here. I felt embarrassed that I invited my friend here.

They ripped my nails off... Ripped my gel right off there was no soak or wrap. This was done with the supervision of someone who wasn't brand new. The girl next to me was having her overgrown acrylics chopped off and they say her right next to me and they repeatedly flicked me in the face. It wasn't a horrible paint job at the end but I couldn't get over the trauma or my nails being ruined. Also $30 for gel instead of the usual $25. Won't return.

The best place in Phoenix. I'm so thankful for it but so scared for it to get too trendy and busy. I wish there was even one more place similar to this.  I want to move in. Great fun bartenders. Great drinks. Fun activity nights. So many good vegetarian foods. Should add calamari

All vegetarian. Was happy to finally visit this place. Very cute little place, the waitresses are very sweet. Was super bummed we missed breakfast, but lunch was fine .. It was noon :-). I think this place is of course still figuring out a few kinks as they are new. Out of the jackfruit sliders which was a super bummer. I got the potato tacos which was a HUGE portion. It lasted me 3 meals. He got the quesadilla which was pretty thin and good, but could use some veggies inside or cabbage on top. A little thin and plain. He also got the tomato alcohol drink which was very, very tiny. I've never seen such a small amount of alcohol besides a shot. Would come back. The food is great but the alcohol is very overpriced for what you get.

Yasss! I LOVE this place. They have a dish with vegetables and tofu, for breakfast! I didn't think I would be into it, but it's so good I haven't been able to order anything else yet. I wish they had mimosas and I would be here every weekend.
