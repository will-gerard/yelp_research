We love our Desert Botanical Garden!  For a family low on cash, buying a membership was a fantastic value.  Looking for something to do with an energetic toddler?  Go hike around the trails for an hour.  Want a fun date night with your spouse?  Check out one of the special events like Bruce Munro's installation.  We also like the semi annual plant sale where we find a lot of rare species at better quality than the landscape stores.    If you go there one time and enjoy it, think about using that day's fee towards purchasing a membership on the way out.  You'll also get a free entrance to a few hundred other gardens through their reciprocal admissions program.

Let's have a cheer for an honest salesman!  Two days ago the battery died in my wife's car.  Yesterday she bought a new battery at AutoZone.  Today I go there to turn in the old one and get my $15 credit for the recyclable core, and they tell me that this battery was under warranty  and so eligible for free replacement.  I'm not sure if we bought the same battery for an old car and it had the same sku, or we actually bought this one and forgot about it, but the dude scanned the thing and found a match under wife's profile.  Instead of refunding us $15 for the used battery core, we got back $155 for the full price of the Duralast.  They have my loyalty from now on!

Nice place, nice guys.  They recommended the tougher inner tubes for my bike, which are a must in central Phoenix.

As a straight guy, Roscoes isn't my usual kind of place.  But hey, the beer is cold, the food is good, and after the first Blue Moon, I started getting into the idea of watching Michigan State football while listening to Rhianna.  The breakfast burrito yesterday was tasty and cheap, as were the Bloodys.  Straight or gay, it's a nice neighborhood place.

Love these guys, they do a fast and professional job.  I like how a real barber will use the straight razor on the neck.  I also respect how they are observant of their religion and closed on Saturdays.  Sunday's at 930 are my usual weekend hair cut.    Also check out the shoe repair next door, cheap rescue for your nice shoes.

Wife and I ate there last night and it was good but not great.  She loved the bacon wrapped filet with Brussels sprouts, and my chicken schnitzel was very good, and would have been great if I was more into capers.  I like where they went with the chocolate cake, but the ceme brûlée didn't live up to billing.  Again, pretty good but not great.    My one main irritation was all the advisories and signs about NO SPLIT CHECKS, and NO SHARED PLATES.  It's a lame way to kick off a night out having to learn all the gripes that management has about the restaurant business.  Our waiter was nice and very professional.    We don't eat out that often, and have had better meals for the same money.  Four stars.

We recently bought a house in the area, so of course have spent a lot of money here.  The good- they're a big box store, so selection is pretty good, and you can sometimes catch deals.    Beware of their service providers!!  We had our carpet installed by a Hone Depot contractor, and they had one small divot in our hallway.  This spot has come more unraveled, and now is a real eyesore.  We're considering exercising the warranty and having them cone back.  We also must had an issue with a fridge we bought.  It had a defective door, and it took half a dozen calls to get someone out to fix it, three weeks after it was delivered.    General service at this location is about what you would expect- most folks don't know enough, but sometimes you can find somebody with real expertise.    If I could provide one piece of feedback for our local Depot, take a close look at who you choose to do business with for installing the products you sell.  It doesn't matter to me who screwed up, only that the HD name is on the receipt, and our experience was bad.  Update 01/30/2016 - My wife was shopping there today, and her credit card was stolen out of her purse, which was in the shopping cart.  We cancelled it through the credit card company, so no harm no foul, just FYI.

Kids love trains!  McCormick Stillman Railroad park is a great place to take little ones.  It's safe enough they can toddle around and burn off some energy, yet small enough you can still make it home for nap time.  I think our little guy could have spent all day in the model train building.  I also checked out options for his next birthday party, and they look affordable and fun.

Dr Edwards is the Vet in Heels.  I love the staff, they are very understanding and caring.  They were very nice when I had to put my cat to sleep last year.  Choosing a good vet is a big deal, so even though I moved to North Phoenix, I still make the drive to Pecan Grove down in Tempe.

I love my local golf course!!  The best thing about this course is it is almost never busy.  I frequently take unlimited mulligans!  With only nine holes, it's perfect if you're lounging around and want to get in a quick round in the middle if the day.  Sometimes I go by myself, and it's like my own private golf course.    At $8 you can't beat the price!  The greens are well kept, and the staff is very helpful.  Only thing I wish is that I could use the driver on the driving range.  It's the perfect course for beginners and kids.

frenzy for foodies.  fiend of mine took me there and talked up the Stetson Chopped Salad so much, I thought there was no way our would actually be that good.  It was.  Better yet, it's one of those rare delicious meals that is also very healthy.

Probably not a lot new I can say about cibo except they're awesome.  Most recently wife and I went with our 13 month old son after work on Friday.  Not only are they a nice date place to go before a night out, but they also can accommodate our toddler with finger foods and friendly service.    Baby B loved his meatballs and chewy pizza crust, while momma had the Di Notti, and I had the Rustica because it has arugula on top which makes me feel I'm eating healthy.  The sparrows got a healthy dose of pizza crust too because B is a bit of a messy eater.   We always do the patio, and love sitting outside in this nice old Phoenix neighborhood.  Let the tourists go to Bianco; locals know Cibo is better, and you don't have to wait four hours for a table.

my wife and i really like the value proposition ooutIf dinner and a movie in one, and a comfy recliner to eat in.  its way cheaper than the Ipic, and the food is pretty good without being too much.  if the movie isn't any good, just have a few mojitos and you'll feel better about it.  my one gripe in case management is reading this:  they need to clean the menus more often.  They're sticky.  Edited on 08/01/2016 because I would have thought they could improve on theater cleanliness by now, but instead of getting better it's gotten worse.  If clean restrooms and clean seats are important to you, go visit the ipic in North Scottsdale.  Wife and I were there on Saturday for star trek and spent $90 on dinner, drinks, and tickets.  Though the theater wasnt busy, every surface was covered in sticky goop.  They would never get away with this in a normal, well lit restaurant, and should feel lucky they haven't had corrective action from Maricopa county environmental services.  Definitely won't take the kids there.     Try the Bistro Mac n Cheese.

delicious, and they're open early, perfect for picking up treats for the office.  i like the German chocolate cupcakes. stick with the sweets though, some of their more exotic attempts miss the mark

I started going here after our son was born at St Joe's hospital a few doors down.  I like the atmosphere and that there are some more exotic pizza options on the menu than most other places.  Probably still not as healthy as a grilled chicken salad, but the ingredients lists make me think I'm eating healthy.    We order delivery now and then, and have always been well satisfied.  My only critique is I wish there were more specials and deals.    Yesterday our family received a soggy mess of a pizza that we ordered from a well known national chain located not far from Z's Thomas Rd location.  Maybe they're not a local Arizona business, but Z's is my pizza place of choice whenever there is a location close by!  Never again will we order from those other guys.

They get very busy for lunch and as a result the food suffers.  I went there yesterday and ordered the chopped salad which is very similar to a more expensive version at Cowboy Ciao.  The corn was stale, no butter for my bread, and they were so busy it would have taken forever to get some.  I like Wildflower, but only at off peak hours.  Edited to add that the founder of Wildflower read this review, reached out to me, and sent a full refund for our meal, along with a gift card.  He was open to feedback and asked for me to dine there again.  It was a very nice gesture, and I will keep on going there for lunch.

The scallops were the perfect dish for my pregnant wife.  We had a delightful night out that didn't break the bank.  Do a search for coupons and deals online before your visit.  The service was fabulous and very helpful.

not my favorite location.  the front desk person told my wife that if she wanted to change her Billing info that a manager would have to do it, and she'd have to come back during the week, between 8 and 4 pm.  Er, she works a grownup job, hello?  So we called another location and did it over the phone.  Overall, LA Fitness is the McDonalds of gyms.  Plenty of locations, and cheap enough, but don't expect fine dining or good service.

Nice guy, and he came out same day.  It's my own fault I didn't ask UP FRONT how much he charges for labor.  Basically charged me $50 to come to my house and tell me I need to replace my washing machine.  It took less than 10 minutes.    Yeah, I didn't ask, but for good customer service, you usually would tell the person, "I have a $50 service minimum."

Wife and I had date night there a while back and had a lot of fun.  We painted Van Gogh's Sunflowers while sipping mimosas and chatting with our fellow classmates.  Very friendly atmosphere, and welcoming to the unskilled newbie painter.

It's food truck day at work!  I was excited to venture outside and see the barbecue folks set up by the curb, which is a nice change of pace from the usual stuff the cafeteria serves.  I ordered the Gangsta sandwich plus mac n cheese on the side.  The sandwich was good but not blow me away great, and didn't even make a pretense of healthy eating.  Fine, I knew it wasn't fine dining here.  I was also disappointed in my choice of sides, being chips, french fries, slaw, and mac n cheese.  It's barbecue, how about some cornbread, baked beans, corn on the cob, fruit or maybe even veggies to make things more interesting.  The mac and cheese itself was ok, but then everyone is putting bacon in things these days.    My biggest issue here was that I paid $15 for lunch at a food truck.  For that I could have had table service at my local Chilis or even a lunch special at Macaroni Grill.  I appreciate the work that went into making the meal, but asking for a gratuity on top of $15 for a sandwich and a side was a bit much.

Mother Bunch is a delightful place right off Roosevelt row.  We were delighted with the staff, and though it was mostly single twenty something's dining, our party had two babies with us and felt right at home.  Wife's burger was absolutely fabulous, though I had one all nitpick about my salad- too many onions for a goat cheese and pear combination.  The bill was cheap, beer selection was great, and I can't wait to try their own brews once they're ready.  Nice neighborhood place in central Phoenix, you should give it a shot.

My wife and I took our sick and congested toddler over to see this tonight and had a really nice time.  There was so much for him to look at, he forgot all about being sick.  We also learned that he knows the words, "Mickey Mouse" and "Train!"  I'm really glad they opened their yard to us, and that there are no HOAs in Arcadia.
