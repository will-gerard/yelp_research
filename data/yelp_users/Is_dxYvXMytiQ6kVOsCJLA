I am so horribly disappointed in Hungry Howies, and after today's services I will not be ordering from Hungry Howies and I will NEVER recommend this place unless you pick up the pizza your self.  Let me elaborate. I am a full time college student as well as work full time. I ordered a pizza for (breakfast/lunch) because I needed to work on my homework before I went to work for the night.  I placed my order in online for delivery to same time. The wait time was expected to be 40 minutes. After waiting for an hour I called to see if the delivery person was lost, since I do live in an apartment complex.  They informed me that no order for delivery was sent in... They did not offer to make my pizza and only after I was told it was my fault because I did not call in my order i received a very "whatever" apology.  If I paid online with a credit card instead of using the cash option I would have lost money. So I had no time to get food from any place else, so I will go to work with out food until midnight or later.  I do understand it was a technical problem and that it was not the managers fault, I do not blame him for any technical problems. However I am very upset in his "its unfortunate" demeanor and I am still shocked looking back that he didn't even try to make it right by sending out the new order. I feel defeated and extremely disappointed in the company that I always stood up for against others who said this company is "crap", because now I have nothing to defend. And I am STILL hungry!

I love this place! I love testing all the beers! The best time to go is during happy hour all the apps are half off and most of the drinks are too! All the people who work there are friendly and down to earth. Even if you go and it not happy hour the food is great and the price is reasonable.

I went with a large group of people to this club on a Saturday night. We had, close to about 20 people in our group, for a shared birthday party. A lot of us decided this would be the perfect place to celebrate because we could get a few hotel rooms and not have to worry about finding a designated driver, as well as being able to dance and gamble a bit. We all went straight to Degree 270, as soon as we got to the club there was a line to get in, which is standard for any club. We waited about 20 minutes before we got to the front, but one guy in our group had on a black v-neck, which is not allowed so he was told he needed to go buy a shirt from the gift shop to get in, or get a collared shirt. His shirt was nice and not in any way offensive, but they would not let him in so our entire group did not go in. Because we had a few rooms and had already spent a lot of money in the hotel, we asked to talk to a manager to see if they could do anything for us. The hostess of the club laughed at us and made us wait for 15 minutes before she even called for a manager. When the manager came out she explained the policy of the dress code, but when looking at the sign it says "refrain from wearing." While the manager explained why we could not get inside, I watched a few guys get in the club wearing v-necks. When I mentioned that, she replied "they are purple members," well am I not spending my money here also? Is a plain black v-neck so offensive that it is worth turning down 20 people from a club that had a lot of money to spend? Then she decided to prove her point and went to the line of people and told all the men who didn't have the right attire to leave, I watched half the line walk away. The most disappointing moment of the night is when we talked to the main manager, whom when we explained our dilemma walked away from a guest as they were talking and said "I HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO!" (I should also mention this man he walked away from, serves for our country.) We did not swear and we did not get out of line. The sad part is everyone I watched enter that club left less than 10 minutes they entered. I could not get a refund for the room and ended up going to old town for the time of my life, even though I wasted all that money at the casino.

I go into mint often. And have never had a problem. Tonight, I was told to mention a girl who works there, her name to get my friends in. I have Never been so humiliated.  We had 8 girls, whom I promised to get in by the name of an employee. When we arrived at Mint it was 1:30, But i promised my friends we would get in. We planned to spend a lot of money. Unfortunately, the lady who collected money the  night of 1/23/15 said she would not let us in (even tough it was my friends birthday, and there was NO line, for all females, and we had been put on a guest list for an employee). The lady at the door actually said  " I dont give a F*ck if you get in, or what you do" she was rude and when I mentioned the employee, name she would not do anything to help us. Honestly we would have paid to go in, but the front door lady (who refused to give her name) did not care or try to get our business. As a current ASU student and bartender at a local bar, I will discourage all and anyone I know from going to mint. Why would I suggest to anyone to get treated so poorly. I also work for a local new station and will not recommend your company to them. We had been treated like garbage, after we had been told by an employee we would be taken care of for bringing a large group t your club...  I am done with mint, and so will many others.

I went into this Cornish for the first time about a month ago, and just now remembered to write a review! I was not feeling very well and stopped in to get soup to-go. I ended up sitting at the bar talking to Stephanie for 45 minutes. Stephanie had many great menu recommendations and was great at picking out a beer according to my preference.  Since it was slow, she served and bartended the entire place alone. She was fun, sweet and great with everyone. Noticed she even had a couple of regulars.  I have always loved Cornish (the food is amazing), always worth the wait, the food has always been amazing. Now, I have another reason to come back!
