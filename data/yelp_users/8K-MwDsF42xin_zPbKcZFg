So, i've lived 3blocks from this place for 7yrs and never been so today i finally made the long drive over to check it out... all kinds of fun stuff here. free pool (tons of tables), shuffle board and foosball... not to mention tons of events coming up; comedy shows, concerts and wrestlng?!  They dont have a happy hr (but they do have drink specials) and the wings i ordered where more like mini wings.... probably wont go there for 'happy hr' but to play pool or check out some crazy/fun event count me in!

used to be a decent place to go play pool, watch the big game and enjoy a few beverages... has fallen hard recently- food is bad, service is worse. no thanks

I have heard great things about Harlow's and my hangover this mornining cried out for some biscuits and gravy...so, I finally gave it a shot. Harlow's did NOT let me down!!  The service was friendly, food was fast and fresh!!   I think this will be my new breakfast spot!

great food, great atmosphere. been here a few times and usually for special occasions or a nice date night. can't go wrong with lunch on the patio...dinners can get pricey but worth it.

The coffee here is oh so good and can't hurt that the coffee is roasted on site. Some comfy chairs and a couch.. who wants to go back to work after sitting down in a big comfy chair with the aroma of fresh coffee?! haha.   Some new paint on the walls and more art work, not to mention guy playing guitar and singing on Fridays (only day i see him there...) makes it a can't miss. Free WIFI too.   The breakfast sandwhichs and burrito's aren't the best but the pastries are damn good.

GREAT FOOD!!   one of my favorite places to take out of towners... small cozy place so can get packed and sometimes hard to hear yourself think let alone have a convo with someone, and might have to wait for a table. but if you go early (5pm) it's perfect.   sangria's are very good.. and i dont usually like 'em!

Lookin for a new lunch spot today decided I would check this place out after reading some great reviews. Doesnt look like much from the outside, but inside I wasnt disappointed. Got there early enough didnt have to wait, sat at the bar and had a very tasty Lamb and Mint Pasty.    I will definatly go here again - maybe for happy hr so i can enjoy a good beer with my pasty!! :)

Me and a few buddys went here last weekend after Oktoberfest and I gota say it was even better the second time around!! I had the Lamb Vindaloo, which was VERY spicey... which required more beer.  It was the first time my buddies had been here and all of them really enjoyed their food.

Great Vibe here...  tons of books can't my hands off the Jack Kerouac Collection, tons records you can listen to. Big comfy chairs and couch. not to mention WiFi.  They are starting up Open Mic nights too!!   They have a variety of teas to choose from and drinks very good!!   both the guys who own it are cool.

This place has been open for 6months or so and bunch of us at work decided to walk over and give it a try for lunch. I ordered the special - pesto chicken penne  which was good (all I was missing was the wine.. ha), heard a few complaints from those that ordered the manicotti and ravioli.    We were the only table and service was slow.  The place has a nice atmosphere and potential, the question is can they stay open long enough to find out..

so, i walked by this place a few weeks ago and noticed a sign 'closed temporarily due to family illness', ok..cool, whatever.  Yesterday walked by again and saw an eviction notice on the door, a cowrker and I decided to be nosey and looked in the windows the whole place had been gutted out.   I guess the family illness was no customers....
