I came here from a recommendation from a friend. Anyone who's ever purchased a custom suit or have rented tuxes knows how the process works. You come in, get measured, fitted, try something on, doesn't fit, do this a couple of times and eventually you find something that fits. Prices were fair. The employee there was friendly and patient which I really enjoyed because having bigger shoulders, it took quite a bit of time getting something that fit that didn't make me look like a fatty "no one wants to look like a fatty :(" If/when I have to rent a tux again, I'd come back here.

Found this place on yelp. They took a look at the issue in my vehicle, said what the issue was, gave a quote and now they're fixing the issue. I really liked the "say it like it is approach" and the fact that they didn't say 8 million things was wrong with the vehicle. Straight pricing. I'm very happy! Oh, they even offered me a ride home because they said the job would take a couple of hours :) I'll make sure to refer these guys to my friends when they need work done on their vehicles.

After watching the fourth of July hotdog eating contest, I had to get my grub on. Found this place on yelp and it's freaking legit. The cheese sauce is super delicious and so are their dogs!

Go here on Thursdays with a team and usually the owner is here at that time. It's an open area, good food, cheap beer. I'm happy :)

The employees here are really friendly and knowledgable. The facility is also very clean, which is a big plus if you've been to a couple of piercing places.

First off, I just want to say how I love the fact that the employees here are not dumb ass high school drama girls! I was visiting a couple tanning business's in Tempe and Scottsdale and the employees at those places were just jerks. The prices here are very fair. They didn't have a product I wanted but ordered it on the spot and said it'll be in two weeks. Who can argue with that?  Random update: The product I ordered did come within a week and I couldn't be more happier.

Rudest staff ever! Pretty just belittled me :( When I went in the gym I had a guess pass and everything was cool. Gave me the your and said I was a jerk for asking him questions about the cleanliness of the gym, hygiene etc. Seriously dude it's a common concern  Edit. I forgot to mention that this guy threatened to call the police on me because I asked for his full name to complain to corporate.

I didn't know what the deal was, yes I was 30 years younger than the average clientele but come on. In order to get a drink I had to show the bartender FOUR I.D's!!! And they still gave me hassle! The girl I was with, she had to show three and they still gave us a huge run around because she didn't have a credit card on her. After convincing them we was over 21 (seriously) for ten minutes, finally got my jack and coke and she got a wine ... Which both served in a plastic cup? Seriously lol. I guess this establishment is too cool for glasses even though it's not a dive. Prices were reasonable and the people there were fun I felt but the employees at the bar were real jerks to us all night :/

If you like roid heads yelling at you because of their incompetency than please join this gym! The most disrespectful ppl workout here! If you talk to the manager Zack about it, he won't do anything. He pretty much ignored me ... Time to cancel my membership. There's better gyms around anyways.

For a smoke shop I was really happy that this place smelt really clean. The employees we're real non-confrontational or pushy. The prices, which I was surprised, was just a lil cheaper then most places I've been to, not like crazy cheaper, but just competitive enough to make going here worthwhile.

This place has name brand tires for cheap! I've purchased no-name tires before for cheap and the drive is terrible and they don't last. This place uses name brand tires, install, rotate, cheap cheap cheap! Very friendly staff also. Came here to get tires for my brothers car. I'll make sure to take my personal vehicle and fleet here now!

I've been here a couple time, mainly because of the cheap beer "which is actually pretty darn good Rollin Rock". So this time I went there because, well, I was hungry. The rotisserie chicken was so delicious! Seriously, I don't wan to sound like a fatty and go into details, but ya, it's freakn great.  The fries were really fresh. I really enjoyed the dipping sauce they gave. Corn hole and the Jenga pieces and some other entertainments there are really enjoyable also. In my opinion, the management knows how to run this place very well. The food is great, beer is good, and it's just a fun place.

I love this place!!!!! Great rotating craft beers on site, a simple beer menu which gives realistic details of what the beer will taste like. The price, like 4 or 4.50 a beer, and for craft beer, that makes me very happy! Good company, great beer, great service. I haven't ever ordered food here, but the presentation from what I've seen others get is very spot on. This is going to be my go to place for sure!

In terms of quality and value I have never seen anything like this! Some serious bang for you buck here; I don't know how they are making their profit margins but whatever. Seriously, it taste fresh to me, filled me up, and was quick. It's located inside the grocery store. Quick side note, very patriotic decor so be prepared.

As a regular, I am disappointed at this location. I feel there are a lot of hidden price increases here compared to what they personally advertise. Look at the menu long enough and check your receipt and you'll often see that the prices don't match or what they advertise ... Grrrrrr   ... And apparently this location advertises the kitchen closes at midnight when clearly they close it much earlier ...

Very friendly over the phone and very knowledgable. I know a couple things about vehicles and I really appreciated that I didn't try to bully around/push added expenses. Definitely worth checking out!

Very good bar just like spokes on southern and boulders on Broadway. The beer menu has good variety, the food menu, from what I've sampled so far, was filling and delicious. Big open bar and a lot of tables.

Great and really friendly staff. Helped me pick out a new cigar. Good AC temperature inside (especially for the AZ summer). They have a decent beer selection which I enjoy a lot. Very clean and comfy on the inside.   Edit: fanciest restroom ever!

I used them for a termite job for a local business and they offered a better warranty than the competitors I called. The prices were very good, there was only one company with a lower rate, but I will pay a little more for an organic product. Very easy and pleseant to work with.
