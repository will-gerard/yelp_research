If I could give zero stars, I would. KFC offers coupons on a Retail app for or phones, but come to find out, you have to print the coupon to use it. If the app is for our phones and we use when we are out, how would we print it. Also, the fact that no where on the coupon or adp does it say it needed to be printed. The manager Mitzy was very rude and laughed at me when I questioned it. I will never walk into another KFC again and I caution everyone from going somewhere that the manager laughs at you and doesn't care.

I went here last night for the first time and it was amazing!  The people were so nice, it was so clean and they helped me find the right colors that I wanted. I have been to a lot of salons in my time, but this one is the best!  I will not go anywhere else.

Okay, brought my hubby here to try and he loved the #35.  He did say pastrami one would be good. Carol also made some amazing potato soup that was the best I had especially on this cold day. Hopefully they keep making it!

I am giving four stars, service was amazing, but the cost of the food and what you get was not that great. The hash browns not cooked enough and cold bacon didn't help the situation. Eggs and toast wee the best, I will stick with those next time.
