The pizza here, phenomenal! They have a sweeter marinara sauce, it's to die for. Their appetizer 3 meatballs in vodka cream sauce, ahh melt in your mouth amazing. I tried the spaghetti calzone in vodka cream sauce this last time, and it was great! Service is always good. If it's busy, which it always is, food can take a little while to come out, but it's worth it!! Oh and you get a free canoli on your birthday :)

i went here the other night for the first time with a date. i am pretty blown away! i had a glass of the caramel road chardonnay.. which was AMAZING!! and i got the fettuccine Alfredo.. it was honestly the best fettuccine Alfredo i have ever had! they also have this table side salad service where they make the salad in front of you and ask what you want in it which was also superb. will be coming back here and telling friends and family about this great little treasure!! oh by the way our server was GREAT too. I forget his name (very bad with names). highly recommended!

This Home Depot will not get my business again. I sent over one of my associates to get a copy of a key made. A simple copy. She comes back and we try it in the door (the key looked significantly smaller than the original).. To my surprise the key doesn't even fit in the lock. Completely different size. The next day I sent a different associate over to take it back with the receipt and by now there should be another employee working the key counter so the key SHOULD come back in perfect condition right? Wrong. The key again is way smaller yet I still decide to try it in the lock, and what do you know? Doesn't work. I then decide to pay them a visit myself to see just what is going on there. I arrive at Home Depot and while walking around for a bit (3 or 4 employees walked by without so much as a simple are you finding everything alright) and make my way to the key counter. I tell the young man that this is the third I have came here for them to make a copy of my key. He just stared at me and asked me for the key. It takes him all of 6 seconds and hands me the key. It once again looked completely different then the original so I pointed this out to him and he told me "no ma'am, it will work"..... Yep, you guessed it. Did NOT work. Home Depot I don't have time to send my employees and myself THREE times to your store for it to still not be resolved. Needless to say I went to Ace Hardware the following day and they gave me 3 copies and all were in perfect condition.

We live around the corner and come here for pizza and beer couple times a month. this one is a little family owned one with the same people always working which is nice. The pizza is always delicious, fresh, and crispy! The booths and chairs are outdated but other than that it's cute on the inside.

Ohhhh this Applebees. Well here goes...  My mom, sister, and myself came here for happy hour on a Monday. We sat at a high top in the bar which close to the door. We were sitting down for close to 10 minutes before the waitress even made an appearance. She asked what we wanted to drink.. My mom got a Long Island, I got a margarita, and my sister got sangria.   Fast forward 10 minutes, we see our drinks sitting at the bar just calling our name! Another few minutes go by and we see the waitress walking around not even checking for our drinks! Finally my mom gets up and has to ask the hostess to have our waitress please bring our drinks that have been sitting up there for 15+ minutes.  She finally brings the drinks over.. And she brings my mom a margarita instead of her Long Island. Not a big deal, these things happen. But no, the waitress decided to argue with us that my mom said she wanted a margarita... Well then.  She brings the correct drink back.. We don't see her for another 10/15 mins and we are starving!   Not once did she smile or make small talk. This Applebees is just sad. We won't be back, which is Unfortunate because my sister lives a mile away!

My sister and I come here a few times a week if not more. I will have to say that mostly the only reason i keep coming is for one of the workers here .. Mercedes ALWAYS makes my drink PERFECT. If  not for her, none of the other girls make my caramel machiatto right at all. But Mercedes is so very friendly, she remembered my name from the get-go and not too long after memorized my drink (which is pretty detailed and specific) This Starbucks is always packed (good for them). There are a few workers here who are not friendly at all and really need to take a few customer service classes (but i have found this is the came with most Starbucks.) But this is definitely my favorite Starbucks :)

This was my second time to this nail salon for a pedicure. The first time I was not impressed. I came for the second time because it is close to my house and pretty affordable. The first time I came was a few years ago, so I thought it may have gotten better right? Wrong. Very very wrong. The first thing that worried me was that I was going to have a male technician. I have ALWAYS had bad experiences with male techs. I decided to bite my tongue and pray for the best. He started off by cutting my cuticles and obviously does not know how to properly cut. He was cutting my skin and hurting me. Then we get to the massage. It was honestly the worst massage I have ever had. He basically slapped the lotion on and was talking in Vietnamese to his colleagues the entire time. It was not 10 minutes that the brochure promises. More like 6. Then comes the hot stones. Oh goodness, reliving this is painful! He put the hot stones on my foot first and I yelped! It was so incredibly hot I felt it burn my skin. I said "whoa that is way too hot!!" He chuckled, said okay, then put them back on that foot in the same spot! I had to pull my foot away and say YOU ARE BURNING ME! Even the nail tech next to him said "too hot! That's too hot fo her!!"   The color was just the basic polish but came out looking good. my mom loved her nails and that is the only reason I am giving them 2 starsDo not waste your money here. You can pay your little sister $5 to give a better foot and leg rub and she most likely won't burn you.

This is one of my fav sushi joints if not THE favorite. This one is wayyyy better than the big one off of 75th ave and bell. We always get seated right away here and drink orders taken promptly. Our food comes out quick and is so flavorful. I usually get a vegas roll and fried rice with a side of shrimp sauce My sister gets a few different rolls as well. The wine is good here too.

I love Rubio's.. I am definitely in here a few times a month. Their fish tacos are some of my favorite I have ever had! I also really love their california bowl with chicken and the green sauce (although red is good too).. My ex always raved about the burritos.. Pretty much everything here is great. All fresh ingredients and you really can taste the difference. There is always the same cashier when I go in.. I cannot remember his name but he is very friendly and always keeps up even when it gets busy.

Firstly, service here is always MEH. The price you pay for the amount of food you get is laughable. You get literally 4 pieces of veggie tempura.  Every other sushi joint I have been to I always get 8-20 pieces of tempura! I've never had a server that was very friendly or competent. If I were you, I would head to the ah-so on 6033 w bell road. A smaller location with better faster service and WAY more food that actually tastes good!

I usually go to the outback on 56th and and bell which my bf and I love.  This particular location won't be getting our business again unfortunately.  The service was extremely slow. We waited 20+ minutes for drinks and an appetizer and then another 20 minutes for our food.  My bf got steak and I got chicken. He asked for medium, and it came out so rare that I could practically hear it still mooing. They took it back for him and brought out another which was cooked properly but by then he wasn't hungry anymore.  My chicken had the absolute worst taste like it was old expired chicken that they cooked. I took 2 bites and couldn't eat anymore. I didn't send it back because I didn't want to be "that couple" who keeps sending food back.   I gave this location 2 stars because our waitress was very nice and also because they comped our appetizer for having a bad experience. Based on how slow it was and how bad the food was, I would have only given it 1 star (which I HATE doing)   Hopefully no one else has the same experience as us!

I love this Mr. goodcents. it is a few miles from my house but other than convenience of location, the owner here is awesome. Every time I come in he always gives me a compliment of some sort. one night i had just got my hair done at the salon and when i walked in he said "i love your hair!" Way to make a girl feel special :) Everyone is always courteous behind the counter, fast, and the food is great. This is the only goodcents i go to!

I have been coming to anzio's since I was a baby with my parents back when this place used to be half as big as it was and they needed to expand. The food is top notch. I highly recommend any of their normal dish pizzas and the chicken and broccoli. Also, their wings are some of the best I have ever had. I bring all of my friends here for some authentic delicious Italian food. Try it, you will not be disappointed.

I have been here many times . I got both my tragus' pierced here on 2 separate occasions. I got 2 dermal anchors done here and I then had some piercings removed because of rejection. The customer service is top notch and all the piercers actually have experience and know what they are doing. I came in here today to get one of my dermal anchors under my belly button removed because the other one rejected, and I was literally in and out in less than 10 minutes. Jacob did the removal, he was fast and knew what he was doing. They didn't charge me to remove it but I still tipped him. And a lot of piercing places charge you to get them removed.   Just an FYI.. If you have a healed dermal, it hurts like a b*^%# to get it removed LOL. But honestly this is the only place I will recommend for piercings !

This used to be our favorite spot but it has gone downhill tremendously. Myself and my sisters boyfriend both ordered the fish tacos that said they came with a few different sauces on them. What we received was a dry lump of fish sitting in a tortilla. When I asked why we didn't get any of the sauces that the menu claimed it came with, the waitresses response was "that's not on the menu.." Ummm excuse me? Ok then! Staff is not trained well, drinks are EXPENSIVE and food is low quality especially for the price. I now know why it's never packed anymore!

Love santisi brothers ! I grew up right around the corner from this place and have been coming here for years. Tons of tvs so great for games, good service, and awesome food. They have darts and pool tables which are in great condition. I would say the only downside is during the week they don't have a server that comes to the dart tables or pool tables so you have to go to the bar to get your drinks which can be a little annoying when it's busy. Other than that I love this place !

Went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary. Top notch. We both got coffee Jameson's to start out. Both of our drinks were very strong and that is NEVER a problem. I also got a vodka water and it was very strong. Drinks here are great!  As for food.. I got the Cajun chicken sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was pretty amazing! The fries are shoestring style and tasted amazing. My boyfriend got the prime rib and said it was absolutely perfect.  We got the white chocolate brownie for dessert.. Definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had! And I'm a sweet food enthusiast ;)  Our waitress was Tara and she was great! Service was a bit on the slow side, but it was Saturday so rah is to be expected.   Overall superb experience and we will definitely be back!

Love this in n out. Best customer service. I forgot my wallet once and I was in the drive thru and realized after I ordered. The lady at the window was kind enough to just let me have it! (My total was only $3.14) but they absolutely did not have to let me have it and I felt horrible for forgetting my wallet! The drive thru line is pretty much always atrociously long, but that's what you get when the food is great and everyone wants it! If you have time, just go inside :)

I LOVE this little gem. One day my sister and i went on yelp because we wanted to find a little mom and pop coffee shop. We decided to give them a try and now we are hooked! Their coffee is to die for. My favorite is the caramel bear trap. They also have homemade goodies and sandwiches. The employees are always attentive and helpful. It has such a great atmosphere. If you're looking for a new little coffee shop to call your home, this is the one.

I ordered delivery from here per a recommendation from a co-worker.  I have ordered from them twice and needless to say I am obsessed.  The first time I got their Egg sandwich with pasta salad on the side and a maple cookie to finish. Everything about the meal was amazing. The flavors were great and really had a lot of taste! I am not even a huge pasta salad fan but you HAVE to try their homemade one! It's to die for. Their cookies are made fresh and really soft.  The 2nd time I ordered breakfast and got a sausage burrito. I think I ate the whole thing in 3 bites.  Delivery has always been fast, around 20-25 minutes even when they quote you 45 minutes.   I will definitely continue to order from here. Yum!!

I've heard amazing reviews about this place so I tried it out for a gel manicure. The place is very trendy and I absolutely love how it is decorated. I was brought to a shelve with a ton of gel it's to choose from.. So that was cool. The lady who did my nails was friendly enough. The gel manicure itself wasn't done well at all. You could see through my nails and on the sides which I didn't realize until I got home. It was a little pricey as well. I'm sure ill be back, especially to try their pedicure. But I can find better service and product for cheaper when it comes to a gel maniure

I absolutely love this little gem!  I grew up about 2 miles from this sushi joint and lived there my whole young adult life. I had never even thought of trying it until my friend recommended it!   It's not that I'm a sushi snob or anything.. I guess you could just say that I judge a book by it's cover.   Knowing that area, it's not the best neighborhood and I didn't think that place could be any good. I know I know, totally misjudged! That's why you don't judge a book by it's cover.. Lesson learned!  Anyways! Best sushi in town. And I've been to many! I always get their crazy boy roll- DELICIOUS! And vegetable tempura. To die for!   Super friendly workers as well. So what are ya waiting for? Don't be so judge mental like me and try it for yourself! Oh and killer happy hour as well

I LOVE this place! I work next door and eat here at least 2 to 3 times a week. The staff here are all extremely friendly. You can tell that they genuinely like working there and like working with customers. The food is always great. I get the rice bowls or a salad and I ALWAYS get the sweet potato fries! They are to die for.

This place is one of those establishments that could flourish with the right management. Unfortunately, it seems that management is 100% incompetent. I've had so many bad experiences here that I couldn't even begin to get into them. If you sit inside, good luck. You won't get served for at least 15 minutes, if they even notice you're there. Service is always horrific. The food is below par. On one occasion I came here with a group of friends and we had to show our IDs at the door. Once inside we got our drinks and headed outside. I had a big security guy following me around and finally he came up to me and asked to see my ID. I was so confused. Didn't I just show my ID at the door? How could I have gotten in if they checked ID's at the door??? He was extremely rude and spent a good solid 60 seconds staring at my ID and turning it over and over. Then handed it back to me and walked away... What? Anyways.. This place can be fun if you want to drink with friends outside. Just don't expect decent service !

Went here on a first date and it was exceptional! The service was great, the drinks were delicious and strong, and the food was amazing. I loved the atmosphere and the fact that they had a DJ on a Thursday night. The dowstairs doll show was creepy but cool! We will definitely be back

I finally was able to get in here after wanting to for months but never finding the time. I desperately needed a gel mani. I was greeted right away by the receptionist and told me that I could actually be seen right away, yipee! Off to a good start.. Then a very pretty girl came out and called my name and introduced herself as Amber. I informed her I had old acrylics on my nails and she got to work right away. The poor girl.. Those acrylics were on there and they were on there good!!! She was absolutely amazing and took her time without hurting me. Soaked in acetone then gently filed them off. Finally they were all off and she put a gorgeous Barbie pink gel on my nails! We chatted the whole time and she was so friendly and thorough! I will definitely be coming back every few weeks to see her. The gel mani was only $35 but they did charge me an extra $10 for acrylic removal which no other salon has ever done. A little pricey for a gel mani but totally worth and it and the fill next time won't be as expensive ;) can't wait to try all of their other services here!

This loving hut it a block away from my house. The first time I came here I got the Indian Curry which I did not totally care for. But I decided to come back as my sister and mom were obsessed with the things they got.   I decided to try the Wonton soup that my mom raved about. Holy YUM! this soup is FILLED with tons of veggies and noodles with delicious broth. It comes with 3 wontons on the side that I usually put right in my soup until they are soft and delectable. The portions are so big I always have left over for the next day, and a generous amount left over at that.  I will say that the only downside is the wait time. I have been in here when there is 3 people and I have been in when it is busy.. no matter how many people are ahead of you, the wait time is always 20-30 mins. So if you are looking to get right in and out, probably not the first choice. But definitely give this place a try even if you aren't a vegan (i'm not)... you won't be disappointed.

This review is LONG OVERDUE. When you read reviews saying this is quite possibly the worst restaurant/bar, they are not exaggerating. I have been here MANY times.. Mainly because it's convenient for my friends who live on the west side, and also because it's easy to go to after the coyotes game.   Don't get me wrong, this place used to be mediocre a few years ago, and it wasn't dreadful. Now I am seriously SHOCKED when I hear it is still open.  Let me give you a little run down of the experience here...   They are DESPERATE to get people in. If you are on their "VIP" email list they will legit email you every weekend and say you have won, and you can get free drinks from 9-11.   And when you get there... They don't have the AC on and they will have all the doors open so it's 115 inside. You will be sweating and crying and wondering where your life went wrong that you had to come to mcfaddens.  The music is usually good.. That's the ONLY plus.. And I mean ONLY.   They give free shots to girls every Friday and Saturday and usually it's fireball. They will make them get on the bar and dance.. It's usually pretty entertaining to watch. The drinks are WEAK.   They have this Asian male bartender who will ALWAYS get on the bar and take his shirt off and do some sort of weird breakdancing. He thinks he is God's gift to earth. this is also very entertaining.   They like to throw hundreds of napkins in the air and scatter the entire dance floor. Not only is this extremely annoying, it's also disrespectful and wasteful. It's makes me cringe. And they get stuck to your shoe and you look like a teenager from a bad 90's movie who is coming out of the bathroom with toilet paper on her shoe.  If you have nothing to do on a Saturday night, go in and order a beer, stand in the corner and watch the shit show commence. You're welcome.

My boyfriend lives a mile away and we come here pretty often.   The food is actually really good. The Jalepeno burger is absolutely delicious.   Bloody Mary's are on point. Service is always good. Music is on point as well.   Only downside is that it's been really slow everytime we go in and we like talking to people and conversing. Would also be cool if there were some pool tables. ;)

This Dunkin Donuts can never seem to get it togehther. After reading the other reviews I have found my visits to this location similar.  There is only ever one register open at a time and a decent sized line. So if you want one item but the person in front of you is ordering 10+ items, you will have to wait the entire time to place your order and be taken care of.  Today, a young gal (who I will leave unnamed) was cashiering. Bless her heart, she was just not having a good day. Her black makeup was smeared under her eyes, she was constantly ringing up wrong orders and one of the food preps had to keep yelling at her the whole time.   When it was my turn, she didn't even muster a hello or how are you. She just stood there and stared at me. I placed my order although she was extremely confused. She said a few times during taking peoples orders "this is my cue to be off and go home." I asked if I could get almond milk in my dink instead of regular milk and she said ok.  My drink came out and I saw it wasn't marked for almond milk so I asked the barista and she screamed at Kylie who then apologized because she forgot to mark almond milk. It wasn't really a big deal because I had time to wait for them to remake it.   I get that everyone has bad days, but in general this Dunkin donuts just never has it together. They also forgot my hash rows and my sandwich was burnt. Butttt the baristas were pretty sweet and made sure I had everything before I left.  The snicker doodle iced espresso was really yummy though!

This Starbucks is one i go to ONLY when i am shopping in the deer valley amc area. I would NEVER go out of my way to come here. The staff is so unfriendly, it honestly makes me sick. There are always new people and i have come across only maybe 2 or 3 that have been somewhat friendly. This Starbucks is dirty (maybe clean the bathroom once in a while?!) My drink is never ever made right, they slop it together. Honestly, don't waste your time coming here unless you are in dire need of coffee.

this one is even worse than the other Dunkin donuts. Customer service? Non existent. Drinks made right? Hardly. Food warm and declicious? Not a chance. I go out of my way to not get coffee here.. And it's a shame since it's on my way to work. I'll stick to Dutch bros.. Better coffee and 100X better customer service.

This is by far my favorite nail salon in town. I have gone to many different nail salons and Estrella nails really blows all the others out of the water. They greet you the moment you walk in. Everyone is very sweet and professional. You really do pay for what you get here. The facility is super clean and the staff is always accommodating. I just had my first pedi here and it was exceptional! It's $24 for the basic pedicure and you get a lengthy massage as well as a free hot stone add on! You really can't beat that. I will continue to come here for both manicures and pedicures!!

I ordered my sister a $50 box of chocolate dipped fruit to be delivered that night. After I placed the order they called me from this location and said the the location that is supposed to deliver to my sister is no longer delivering???? and that I would need to come pick up my order. I explained that this is really inconveniencing me and that I cannot pick it up. She literally did not say anything on the other line she was just silent. Not offering anything to be done. So i had to call my sister and ruin the surprise and ask if she could go pick up her own gift... awkward. when she got there they hadn't even made it yet. So the girl says she is going to finish making it while my sister waits. the girl leaves the cash register wide open with all the money in it, and walks to the back. YIKES. What my sister ended up getting was a box of chocolate fruit that were literally thrown in there and looked HORRIBLE. She sent me a pic and I was pretty shocked to see it looking so disarray. I should of just cancelled my order when they said it could not be delivered. Their products are way too overpriced. This is the 2nd time I have ordered from them. Will not make that mistake again

I have been in a few times to order takeout, as I work close by. Each time service is seriously lacking. It has been someone new each time, and they make me feel like they really can't stand their job. One time I waited for almost 10 minutes at the bar to be helped, even though we made eye contact several times, she never even acknowledged me. The food is pretty decent.. but not worth the poor service in my opinion.

Love this place. Cool atmosphere.. Good crowd.. Fun music. But as said in the other reviews, service is pretty poor. Even when it is dead I stand around waiting for 15 mins to be asked my drink order. Ill be back though because it's a great little place. Drinks are expensive too (unless you stick to beer)

Boyfriend and I randomly stopped in to watch a playoff bruins game. We ordered a few drinks, watched the game and ordered some food. The buffalo chicken salad was among the best that I've had! And I am a huge buffalo *anything* fan. The staff was very attentive and the ambiance was very laid back. A great dive bar! They have pool tables as well. I will be back to try more of their tasty food!

Like everyone else, this place has made me a regular. Their drinks are top notch and they offer almond and soy milk. The food here is way above par. Their Nutella and strawberries crepe is my favorite! I posted a pic of it if you would like to check it out. I have also had their southwest chicken sandwich and a breakfast crepe. The flavor in their food is amazing and you will not be disappointed. The ambiance is very homey and chic. The staff is always friendly. Their honey latte with almond milk is my fav!

Jersey mikes used to be one of my fav sub shops. The service has REALLY gone downhill. A year or so ago they had some of the best customer service.. They would greet you upon entering and small talk with you, not to mention they would make your subs in a TIMELY manner.   I went there on Saturday and there was a mom and son in line in front me me. Great i thought! I beat the rush! ... Or not.  The gal slicing the meats who is the first person to take your order, doesn't even register that there are people standing here waiting to order. She must have been doing an online order because she was just chopping those meats up without a care in the world.  Finally after literally 6 or 7 minutes, she looks up and says "I'll be right with you".. Well ok at least she acknowledged us!   It only got worse from there.. The guy putting the condiments on the sandwiches was one of the slowest workers I have ever witnessed. He just couldn't get it together and took a few minutes to put on a few condiments on each sandwich. The lady in front of me turned around and gave me a "what the hell, this is taking so long" face.   There was now a line almost out the door and a few people left because it was taking so long.  By the time I got to the register it was about 20 minutes since I came in. 20!! That is ridiculous!  The subs are great I love the food. But for the quality of service and prices, I'll head to jimmy johns where I can be in and out freaky fast.

This place is the bomb! The prime rib is some of the best I have ever had. The fish absolutely melts in your mouth. Love the outside seating which is what we usually opt for. The one time we sat inside it was so hot we were sweating and had to ask if they could turn the air down. It is crazy packed on the weekends but that's to be expected. Give yourself enough time to get down there and wait! Service has always been really good. I love bringing people here who have never been! Yummy

Food is good. Price is high. Service is weak. I've been here a few times and each time the service is just meh. Today my boyfriend and I ordered it to go. The guy making the food was very nice and helpful. The bar staff was slow and unfriendly. We had to pay at the bar and they ignored us for 10 minutes even after we asked if we could be helped. They acted like they were extremely busy but there was hardly anyone there.. Need to train and hire better staff.

Let me start off by saying that I have been to many a nail shop in my day and I always go in to new salons with an open mind. This was by far the worst nail experience I have had. Not the worst nail salon experience but the tech herself was the worst I have had. I had old gel on my nails from a previous salon, it was the gelish. If you know anything about gel polish, then you know gelish is very thick. She started my yelling at me, not telling me, that I should have never went to the place I went to for my gels. She then put my nails in acetone to get the gel off, then taking them out to file off the gel. The issue was that she started cutting my skin with the nail file then shoving my hands back in the acetone. Then she would repeat. It started burning so bad that I was almost in tears. Once I couldn't take it anymore I took my hands out of the acetone and told her I will not put them back in there, it's burning me!!! I showed her the cuts on my fingers that she was causing and she kept saying "I don't see them" and finally she literally yelled at me "YOU NEED PUT YOUR HANDS BACK IN THERE" she was the rudest tech I have ever had. After she finished the most painful nail job, she got her lotion out and I thought, finally, a little relaxation.... Or not. She slapped the smallest dabble of lotion on each hand and rubbed it in for a few seconds. That was the great massage they explained in their pamphlet... I  am sure that there are other decent nail techs there. Unfortunately this one did not have her name on her shirt but her station is the first row to the right... If you walk in and see them heading you to that booth... RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!  I hope no one has to deal with that pain as I did. I attached a picture of the cuts on my fingers. Beware!!!

So I used to work for a European wax center for 4 years.. I wanted to try a new location that I have never been to and this one is close to my house.   While looking up yelp reviews I saw great things about Tiana and wanted to give her a try.  She is AMAZING! And I am obviously not new to waxing, have been doing it for 5 years. She did my brows and Brazilian. Brows look great. One of the best brazilians I've had! She was extremely fast but super thorough. Always asking how the temp of the wax is, and if I'm comfortable. She even tweezed the left over hairs.   We also realized we have a lot of mutual friends. She was awesome and definitely my new wax girl !

I should have read the reviews before ordering but in my defense I was pretty drunk.  Let me also mention that I LOVE pizza.. and food.. especially when intoxicated.. so it is very hard for me to not like anything pizza involved.  We ordered on a Saturday so I knew the wait time was going to be pretty lengthy. After an hour of waiting I called to check on the order and the girl who answered the phone was extremely rude. She barked at me that the order was in transit and then hung up! It really isn't my fault that you are working late on a Saturday night... but that's none of my business...  Anywho.. Another 20 mins go by and I finally get a call from the driver saying he is lost...   After an hour and a half we finally get our cold food... sweet!   The food... *cringes*.. the pizza was barely edible. It had such a weird taste I can't really describe it. The mozzarella sticks were under-cooked.   My friend who had way too much wine who was passed out when the food got there.. woke up after smelling food.. took one bite of the pizza and spit it out and yelled what is this?!!  I think you catch my drift

Unfortunately.. I want to cry even writing this review because my hair was so jacked.   I bought a groupon after a recommendation to see Natalie. Silly me, of course I won't get the experienced stylist when I buy a groupon! I was put with someone (through her own admission) that had been there for 3 weeks. Honestly this of course makes sense. Give the new clients to the new stylists.   I don't want to say her name because I really don't want to tarnish her reputation. She really was very sweet.   The hair cut... Oh the hair cut. *tear*  Chopped about 4/5 inches off when I asked for 2. My hair was underneath my breasts and now is above my shoulders. That wasn't the worst of it though.. I can handle a short hairstyle. It grows back, I am aware. The horrifying part were the layers.. The layers were so so so bad.. It looked like I have a mullet on top of my head, over my hair?? Hard to explain unless you saw it. My normal hair girl spent forever trying to fix it. I mean, my hair girl just stood there gaping at the back of my head saying "WHY GOD WHY!!!!" Before she got started on fixing it. Or, trying to fix it as well as she could. We had to chop off even more just to make it even!   I do want to say that the owner Denise is really pleasant. She checked me in and out and she was very nice. If you are a first time client, I would try to get in with Natalie (who my friend sees and her hair always looks great) or at least another stylist that has been there for a while. It just scares me that someone with that little of talent gets hired at a nicer salon.  Again, I do take responsibility because I bought the groupon and thought I would give someone else a try without any questions.  I definitely won't be straying far from my original hair girl. Ever. Again.  If she is on vacation, I will wait!   Like I said, I don't want to bash this salon by any means because I thought the owner was very sweet and I am sure they have some awesome girls. If you get a groupon make sure you ask how long the stylist has been there and get someone with some experience !!

My sister purchased a 60-minute groupon here for my birthday. I went online to schedule it, and it was very simple. I did need to reschedule so I called and like many other reviews say, you cannot get a hold of a live person. I left a message and they never returned my call. I decided to go back online and see if I could figure out how to reschedule it. I did and it was pretty simple so that was good enough.  Let's start by talking about getting to the appointment. The parking lot was EMPTY and I mean completely deserted. There were 2 other cars in the parking lot which I figure had to be the front desk girl's and my massage therapist's. This was alarming BUT understandable if there is only one massage therapist working at that time.  I arrive at 11:50 for my 12 apt and fill out paperwork. The receptionist informs me that It will just be a few minutes. 12 o'clock comes and goes and I see no therapist in sight. Finally at 12:05 someone opens a door and 2 people walked out, assuming they did a couples massage. A minute later (12:06) I get called by my therapist Laura. She is rushing me in the room (obviously she is running behind) but I get no apology as to me having to wait or to her running behind. Not good... I have worked in customer service for 10 years, this is a big no-no for me. She then asks the basic questions and leaves me be while I change.   The massage itself was good. She had adequate pressure and asked me if it was to my liking at one point which it was. She used her elbows A LOT during the massage. I am used to this procedure, I have had many massages in my life and worked at plenty of spas.. but she definitely used her elbows more than any other tech I have had. I felt like it was more of an elbow massage than a hand massage.   Either way, it was good. Not spectacular, not horrible, just good.   My issue, and it is a big one, is that she finished at 12:59. By the time I got in the room (12:06), talked to her about what I wanted, changed, got under the covers, and waited for her to get back in the room, it was easily 12:10 by the time it got started. So that means by her finishing at 12:59, I got a 49 minute massage. This REALLY grinds my gears. If a business or individual is running behind and it is NOT the client's fault, then you absolutely give them the extra 11 minutes that YOU were behind on. Again, I have worked at many spas and this is just common knowledge with not only massages but facials etc.Especially being my first time, you would think they would want to make a better impression. Unfortunately I will not be referring my friends or family here.  With everything in consideration, I just cannot give more than 2 stars. They desperately need to redecorate and clean their lobby... You can see the pics I took. The whole feel of this place is just MEH. There is absolutely nothing that stands out. The rooms are plain, the employees personalities were plain, the lotion was plain. I would say that for a $60 massage it would be decent enough, if they actually gave you the full time. Good luck !

Service here is below par. Food is always good but the customer service really needs A LOT of work. Seems like they will just hire any Joe Blow off the street. Other than that, it's your typical jimmy johns with good tasting subs

I don't have much to say (which is never a good thing).. Service was slow.. We came on a Friday night so we expect it to be busy, but for the wait staff to be able to hanled it. I was brought the wrong drink after  already waiting 20 minutes for it. Appetizer came out with food. Wings were lacking flavor all around. I don't know why we ever bother going to any of the Buffalo Wild Wings. Never a good experience. Skip this place and head over to Olive Garden next door where they at least pretend to make their food from scratch

I seriously LOVE Dutch bros. The best part about Dutch Bros (besides the awesome coffee) is that EVERYONE is always in a good mood that works here! They are extremely upbeat and happy. They always ask how you are and start small talk. The music is always fun and upbeat and it's just a great atmosphere. If the line is super long, an employee will run out to your car and take your order.. Now that's what i call service!!

So, today was my first time coming to Angelina's. I have driven by it many times and have been wanting to try it for quite a while!  Let's start off with the bad.  I walked in and there were a few people in the restaurant and only 2 people sitting at the bar. Since I was alone I decided to also dine in at the bar. I sat down and made eye contact with the man behind the bar and he did not even greet me, he just walked away. Another 5 or 6 minutes go by until I am greeted, I had to grab a menu from the hostess stand.  My order was put in and then a big group came in and I thought to myself "thank goodness I got here before the rush".....  Yeah well, no such luck. After 15 minutes go by I start to get a little annoyed.. considering there was hardly anyone in there when my order went in, it should be coming out by now.  At 20 minutes, one of the servers came up to me at the bar to tell me it should be any minute, but he looked pretty worried like they had forgot to put my order in.  At 25 minutes another server comes up to me to say it will be any minute now!  At 30 minutes I went up to tell them they will need to make it to-go now since I have to go back to work.   Perhaps the worst part about it, and when I knew for sure that they had forgot my order, was when the gentleman who ordered 10 mins after me at the bar, got his food well before me.  To their credit, they did apologize many times for the wait, and they were friendly. What irks me though is that no compensation was offered whatsoever. Hell I would have even appreciated 10% off at that point. It was clearly their fault and they dropped the ball, they should have been willing to offer SOMETHING. I literally ordered one thing.  One more thing which was really icing on the cake... when I finally got back to work ready to dive in, there was a very long black curly hair sitting right in there. Looooovely.  The good:  I got the yellow curry with chicken.. it was some of the best curry I have had. I will definitely be back to try more of their food and hopefully I have better service next time and can edit my review because I really hate leaving poor reviews. I will just make sure to never come here when I have plans after!  All in all, if you aren't miserable enough working 9 hours on a Sunday, head over to Angelina's for your 1 hour lunch break in 120 degree weather where you can spend 90% of it waiting for your food.

The lady at the information counter told my mom and I that we did not need my dad here to transfer the title into my name since it is his name on the title. We asked her if she was sure and she said yes since it was notarized. We waited 2 hours yes I repeat TWO HOURS and when we finally got called up we were told that yes we do need my dad here. We were FURIOUS. We had to call my dad and make him come up here and wait another 30 mins!!! I will never be back to the mvd on 26th ave north of the 101. The wait time, old dirty office, and poor customer service is despicable

LOVE this place! My sister moved right around the corner from them and we decided to check it out. The vibe is really fun... they play club music and have about a million different drink choices! Definitely not your spot if youre looking for a quite place to do homework. But if you are looking for some BOMB boba (see what I did there...) then you have to check this place out. Get the snickers boba... it's delic!

Let me start off by saying that I'm probably one of the few people who does NOT like pita jungle. I have tried a ton of stuff on their menu from gyros, to salads, to chicken dishes. Nothing has impressed me to make me want to eat there.   Pita cafe is right next to my work and I was actually walking to subway next door when I saw a lot of people in the pita cafe. I looked at their menu and decided to give it a try, and boy am I sure glad I did!!  I got the Mediterranean pita that has chicken, cucumbers, feta, tomatoes, onion tzatziki sauce and Greek sauce. I was absolutely blown away. The flavor is like nothing I've tasted before in a gyro. So mouth watering!   I also got a side of Greek fries that were to die for! They have some sort of meat and feta on the fries. I took them back to work and the girls ate them up!   Needless to say, this is my new lunch spot! Can't wait to try their other menu items.

Please understand that I have been to MANY a nail salon in my young life. There seems to ALWAYS be something I dislike about nail salons, I just NEVER have a good experience. Well.... That was BEFORE this nail salon! I have never ever had a better experience. May did my pedicure and Eric did my gel mani. I also have never had a positive experience with a male tech... Eric was off the charts. He was extremely funny, caring, and my nails look phenomenal. He told me I was a princess and deserve to be treated well. Really?! Where else can you go and hear that?! This salon is extremely clean!! Right when you walk in you immediately know you're going to have a great experience. May did the most phenomenal pedicure. She completely took her time and my toes look perfect!!! I cannot stop talking about this amazing experience!! I will refer all of my friends and family here!! Do yourself a favor and stop in, you will be highly glad you did. Check out my pics I uploaded :)

Let me start off by saying that I am a bit of a restaurant  snob and it takes quite a lot to impress me.   Absolutely love this gem! We found this place by accident. I live by Tempe marketplace and we came here to go to thirsty lion but there was an hour wait. We wandered around and saw stadium sports grill.. We were skeptical at first.. But once we sat down we soon realized it is not your average sports bar! we found out that they had only been open 2 weeks! Our waitress was awesome! She was super friendly and very attentive. We then decided to give it another try a few nights later. Staff was amazing again plus our food was once again delicious.   We have since made it our "spot" and come here often. Food is way above par for a sports grill, GREAT customer service! Have had nothing but amazing staff. Happy hour is awesome as well! We love to come here for a sports game for a few drinks and food then play some darts!   Give this place a try, you will NOT be disappointed!!

I am officially obsessed with this place. It came highly recommended from my sister who went with her boyfriend. Decided to go with them plus one extra. You can't go inside unless you show them the text on your phone saying your table is ready (not sure if this is every night or just on the weekends.) but the ambiance is amazing. the lights are dimmed and the tables can be romantic but it's also great for a group of friends. They have hundreds of cocktail to choose from. I tried a bunch of different ones! One thing to keep in mind: the waitress told us that the drinks in the tall glasses are less strong and the short ones with no ice are strongest. I know this is common sense but still good to know! You should definitely come here on a date or with a group of friends. It's a blast!

I brought my sister and her boyfriend here for their first time.. I had been to the deer valley location with my parents so I thought we would give this location a try. Well, our experience was not very good. Our server Damion seemed friendly enough when we first sat down.. But apparently we were mistaken. We received our food from a food runner, and he hastily set our food down and ran off... While we sat there for a few minutes with no silverware.. Damion never even came over to see if we even received the right food, let alone see that we didn't even have silverware. We had to flag him down and ask for silverware. He came back and set it down, but again never even checked up on us.. Or asked how our food was. At the end of the meal we weren't asked if we wanted dessert or if we needed anything else. We weren't asked if we beefed boxes. These are just basic duties of a server..... Anyways.. The food was good I would probably be back just hope for better service next time

So my mom went in for an eyebrow wax on 1/26. She was taken into a room and laid on a bed. A woman, who didn't say a word to her the entire time, started putting oils and creams on her eyebrows before waxing them without saying a single word as to what she was putting on them.   Now let me mention that I worked for European Wax Center for 4 years. Protocol is that the client needed to fill out paperwork where you would describe your allergies, talk about what medications you are using, and advised when a good/bad time to get waxed is. I know most of these nail salons don't do this but that is SCARY that you could go in pay $10 and get a brow wax without a single word being said. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Anyways ... It was $10 my mom paid and left. Her brows looked amazing!! My mom said the lady really took her time (and that it was really painful).. But nonetheless they looked great.  Fast forward to 24 hours later.. My mom wakes up.. Eyes swollen shut. She literally cannot see out of them. She has red swollen blisters ALL OVER her eyebrows and her eyelids are so swollen they went over her eyes. The itching and pain was unbearable. It is now 1/30 she still has extremely swollen eyes and red bumps after putting on tons of creams and medications to help.  My mother was clearly allergic to one of the oils and creams she used. This is why it is SO DANGEROUS to go to a place like this that does not ask you a single question and you still hop on that table to get waxed. The only reason my mother doesn't go to European wax center to get waxed is because she doesn't want to pay $18 for a brow wax. But SERIOUSLY if you care at all about your eyebrows and face.. Please do 1 of 2 things.. Either DONT go to a nail salon .. Or if you must.. Please ask them what oils and concoctions they are putting on your face before they even get started.   We gave it 2 stars because the brows looked great . I hope they start using better products and asking clients what meds they are on!!!

Love this place! My guy introduced me to Bahn Mi's when we are at a Vietnamese restaurant once. I decided to google bahn Mi's in my area and this place came up! I've had the classic bahn mi and the pulled pork. Both are delicious! All of the different veggies and sauces really make them unique and delicious! I got the taro milk tea with boba. It's really good! The sandwiches are big, almost footlongs. I recommend adding their chili garlic sauce that you can find by their soda machine. It really gives that extra kick! Service has been both fast and friendly each time. Inside is very clean and I love how it is decorated. Definitely give this place a try! The next one I want to try is with the fried egg. I've read great reviews about it and have seen many people ordering it both times I went. Yum!

This review is another one of mine that has been a long time coming. I have been to this dunkin donuts 20+ times. The ONLY reason is that it is directly on my way to work and convenient when I have NO time for other options.   First off... the coffee. At this dunkin donuts it is NEVER consistent. I have maybe liked my drink 3 times in total. Depending on who is making it, your drink could taste different every day! Now that is a problem. A lot of the time I go through the drive through and don't take my first sip until I am already driving away.   Today I ordered a small hot vanilla latte. HOW in the world can you mess that up?!! It was COLD.. i'm not exaggerating either. and literally tastes like old foam. I have no idea what they do back there when making drinks but it CANNOTTTT be that hard to teach your employees how to properly make drinks. People can talk all the crap about starbucks they want but at least they are fairly consistent and their coffee is drinkable.  The customer service is also hit or miss. I had a very snobby drive thru gal a few days ago but this morning the gentleman at the window was very nice. I would just steer clear of dunkin for coffee in general.

Let me start off by saying THANK YOU for opening one on the west side finally! I have been to the location in tempe and I live in the west valley, so I am beyond excited they opened one here!   I read the other reviews and thankfully my experience was nothing like theirs. The line is not confusing at all... If you have ever been to chipotle then you should know exactly what you're doing in cafe rio. You go to the far end and order just like you would at chipotle.   I got (and it is BY FAR my favorite thing to order here) the sweet pork salad. TRUST me you absolutely want to order the sweet pork. It is the perfect amount of sweet and just a TINY bit of spice. Even if you don't order a salad, get the sweet pork. Moving on... I got rice, pinto beans, lettuce, salsa, cilantro, crispy strips, guac (which isn't extra ha) and a lime wedge on the side. The tomatillo dressing is my favorite. The whole salad is on top of a giant piece of tortilla. It's mouth watering!  All 3 women who helped with my order were very friendly! The cashier gave me a punch card and explained how it worked. It was also decently busy for lunch, and as they grow, they will get busier.   Definitely worth coming here!

As a previous member of 24 hour fitness and LA fitness.. Let me just tell you.. This gym blows them clear out of the water.   Not only is the equipment new and the entire place spotless, but you get free towel service both hand towels AND shower towels!! This is so big for me because I usually shower at the gym especially if I go before work. AND they have hair dryers in the women's locker room, body lotion, and q tips. You can pay extra for the "executive lockers" where you get your own name plate on it, and can leave your stuff in there without ever having to take anything home. I may just upgrade one of these days!  The only downside is that they close early on the weekends. Some 24 hour fitnesses and LAs were open 24 hours and that was a great advantage.  I honestly am so happy I made the switch. Oh! And they have their own smoothie and protein shake bar and they are actually really good. You don't even have to bring your card they will just charge the card you have on file.   The customer service has been top notch as well.. They're always smiling and greeting me right when I walk in the door!  As with any gym, steer clear of Monday's around 5, you won't be able to move.
