Relaxing. That's the first word that comes to my mind when someone asks about Bergies. I come here to study when the weather is nice because the outdoor seating is amazing, especially in Gilbert. Even if it's sunny out, there are plenty of umbrellas and some indoor seating.   Their coffee is amazing as well, but I always order their chai latte. I just prefer the drink over coffee. That's just me. But it still tastes excellent.   I definitely recommend coming here to relax and get some work done if you have any. Or, reserve the place and hold a little private party in their beautiful like yard. Either way, can't go wrong with Bergies.

Soccer players, keep away. I've been playing soccer at this facility for six years. The location is close to me, only about a five minute drive, so convenience is the only reason I return.   This review is entirely based on soccer, I have not tried or used any of the other facilities.   First off, the $3 entry fee is a complete nuisance. The fees to play there are already greater than many of the other soccer facilities in AZ and to add insult to injury, you end up paying around $30 dollars on entry for the season. If you want to bring family and children, expect to pay $3 for each one.   Secondly, the field maintenance is horrendous. A common practice to avoid re-turfing a field is to add more rubber pellets. Big league is basically a rubber pellet turf. The turf is unforgiving and really hard on the knees due to the turf condition. Best to avoid if you're coming off a recent knee or ankle surgery.   Third, the competitiveness is dangerous. I've played in many other leagues, yet big league is the odd one out. I do not know what it is about the crowd that is attracted, but I've seen more dirty and unsportsmanlike acts at big league than any other place. I've witnessed a player break through the glass boards due to recklessness by the opponents. I've gotten hurt at big league more than any other facility and league.   The refs aren't bad. I really do not have any complaints. You'll get some missed calls, but I can't think of a soccer game that I've played that was called perfect. So I have no issues there.   Lastly, management is lackluster. You can play the same team twice in a season, but play an entirely different set of players. Roster checks are irrelevant. Sometimes I wonder why I even pay the player fee... Management will also just baffle me at times, they will promise a team a discount for next season and once that season starts, we will go about four or five games with management hassling us on paying full fees.   Overall, just be aware of what you're getting into.

Excellent experience here! First off, the location throws you off a bit; but once you get into 32 Sheas little atmosphere, you'll be surprised how nicely ambient the place really is. I ordered an iced chai latte, which is probably the best one I've had in Arizona.. Trust me, I've tried many chai lattes. I also ordered a vegetarian sandwich on ciabatta and that was excellent as well. I came here to study and its a great spot to do that. I'll definitely come back when I'm back in the area!!

This place is a vegetarians dream food truck. I ordered the cheese crisp and it's an all vegan option unless you choose the natural mozzarella. This food truck is at Agritopia on Wednesday after 4pm and on Saturday at old town gilbert.   Not much selection, but no complaints, it's a food truck, I don't expect a menu the size of Cheesecake Factory. Nevertheless, this place is definitely a try and I've recommended this to all my friends.

Love the atmosphere here! I usually come to study and drink some of there coffee/tea. I was also surprised to see bulletproof coffee on their menu, and it was definitely good!!   I can sit at this coffee place for 6-7 hours studying and not even notice the time go by. It's well worth a visit whether you're studying, catching up with a friend, or going out on a date. Parking is a little tough if it's a crowded day, but across the street there is plenty of parking.

First let me start out by saying that the bread here is phenomenal. I ordered a salmon tartine cold sandwich, by recommendation. The atmosphere is exactly as they describe, French music, the patio to people watch, and being right on mill, can't go wrong with sitting outside in the beautiful arizona winter weather. I definitely recommend the bread while sitting down outside to study! Had this place not been 40 minutes away from my home; I would come here much more frequently to study. Enjoy and take in this bistro. Well worth my time.

Where do I begin? This place is fantastic and the service is phenomenal. I had called ahead to put my name on the list for a larger party. Upon arrival, my name wasn't on the waiting list 2 hours after calling, the staff apologized and put us back next in line. We had to wait an hour extra, but the servers kept coming out to check on us and provide drinks. Once we entered to our table, Pomo had set up a variety of free appetizers for us as their way of saying sorry, not only that, the waitress that was serving us was probably one of the best that I've had in awhile! The food is incredible, the appetizers were amazing, and the desserts were fantastic. Pomo definitely showed us that they cared and I commend them on their respect and admiration towards their customers. Will definitely come back in the future!   Do not miss out on this place.

Zad Al Khair is one of those restaurants that has high potential, but struggles by cutting corners and irresponsible management.   First impressions is that Zad Al Khair is a wonderful open restaurant, perfect for entertainment, and probably provides a great nightlife. Our party (12 people) had prior reservations, but upon arrival, the staff was not prepared for us despite the restaurant being empty. We ordered a wide variety of appetizers to start off. Once the appetizers arrived, the hummus was dried (as though it was sitting out for a couple hours), and the lettuce in the fattosh was blackened on the corners. The tabouli was bland, the fresh fries were nothing special, but the baba ghanoush was actually quite good. We requested the humus be switched for a new plate, in which, when fresh, the humus is not bad.   We all ordered separate plates, mostly consisting of the mixed meat platter. After 30 minutes, 6 plates arrived, consisting of mixed meat platter, falafel, and lamb shanks. Our party waited for the other 6 dishes for the remaining people in the party for nearly 45 minutes before we approached the staff. They stated they did not have the orders in, but if we put them in at that time it would take another 30 minutes. We declined that offer. They did not take responsibility for their mistake, but instead blamed the "lack of staff available to accommodate" for our "large" 12 person party. They stated that they were not prepared for our arrival, although we reserved in advance. We ended up paying the check and walking out. Their irresponsibility cost us valuable time. There are plenty of better authentic middle eastern food nearby such as Khyber Halal, Persian Room, or Ali Baba. Save your time and money and head to one of those places.   About the orders we actually received, in summary; the falafel was greatly overcooked (blackened) and was left uneaten due to the flavor of the burns, the mixed meat platter was all cooked at well done to burnt (no real flavor or excitement), and the lamb shanks were average at best. It's disappointing that such a restaurant with the size and atmosphere it has, produces food that is clearly done by a lack of effort. Save yourself and head someplace else, at least until they make a conscience effort to change their motives and responsibilities.
