My management team came in from Dallas took me out for lunch on my 15year anniversary at work. I've always heard good things about Carolinas and wanted to try it. So Carolinas it was. It was a bit unorthodox for my managers who usually eat at much 'nicer' places. But it wasn't long before they opened up and said that this reminded them of home! I was impressed with the food, a bit disappointed that they don't have carne asada. I had to settle for machaca, which was good. My new office is located a quarter mile from here so I have a feeling that we will be visiting more often!

This place is very unassuming from the looks on the outside. BUT! Don't let that fool you!! Once you step inside, you'll see that it will be packed with patrons who know that the food is delicious! The price is right for the food and the friendly service you get here!

Ok so this is not like the swap meet in east Mesa. It has similarities like your typical swap meet merch, and seeing the same products at several booths for different prices.  That's where it changes up a bit. This place has the Mexican flare to it. The food, the music. THEY EVEN HAVE A CAR LOT SECTION! Pretty decent prices for these cars too, but you have to ask the right questions. They are used cars after all. And the main reason i come to this park and swap is because they have a resident locksmith here. I get all my keys made here. This place is a guy's shopping dream palace lol. I buy my Converse here. You can get a tattoo, work boots, work t-shirts AND TOOLS here.  A great way to spend a Saturday!

This is one of those places that you see everyday as you drive by. It's also one of those places that you kick yourself for not coming here sooner!  I ordered the Carne Asada burrito, which is my usual when I'm in a new place. It was good sized, I could tell it was going to fill me up. It had the meat, guacamole, beans and Pico de gallo. It is unusual that it came with beans inside, but the were really good so i didnt mind. But it made it a little light on thr meat. Again, i didnt mind because it was reall good. I asked for the Pico on the side. They brought green and red salsa with the burro (different from the one with the chips) I liked the green alot but not the red, I liked the chips' salsa better. The cook himself brought my plate out which was cool. But was a little put off when I asked for more chips and salsa. The server brought them. She was really nice, and the cook was probably just busy... Once I started to eat the burrito I only put it down once before I finished it, it was that good lol. The tea had a funny taste I drank my water instead. The have pepsi products  (dislike).  I'll be back, and if you haven't been here you should definitely give it a try!

I'm not a huge fan of village inn, but they are close to my house and they have a decent breakfast. The service is pretty slow. I've been sitting here with a menu for 5 minutes and no one has stopped by to even take my drink order. I could have and should have gone to Mimi's Cafe. #tookawrongturn  #lifesregrets It's kind of busy, but not that busy. 10 minutes still no service.... After finally having a server come to my table and take my order, she brought my coffee and water. I noticed the silver ware was dirty. REALLY sorry. There was something on the spoon that looked like it came from the previous patrons. GROSS! I can't come back here, sorry

Texas Roadhouse is one of my favorite places for a great rib-eye steak. They are friendly and i like how they treat veterans. They are usually pretty crowded so make sure you plan to be there a while. Sometimes longer than it takes you to eat your meal. And we actually got our meals in good timing. It's a good place to go for a family dinner.

Came here for Sunday lunch after church. I was with a 9year old, so having the new tablet with games at each table on it kept her occupied, which was nice. They were busy so our server was a little distant, and hard to get a hold of. That was a bit annoying, but the food is always good here in my opinion. Of course I will always be back, because I love the food :)

My second visit: I was looking for a good place to have breakfast that was close to where I live since I had to go to work soon. I didn't know Mimis served breakfast so I thought I would give it a try. When I arrived at 7:25 am there was only one other party. I waited a few minutes for someone to seat me. I didn't see anyone so I thoughtI would peruse the menu while I stood there. Finally a server showed up and sat me. She took my drink order and soon brought my coffee (+water even though I didn't ask for water=nice touch) and took my order right then. Another nice touch, since I was pressed for time. Then a coffee warm up right away. I'm liking this visit so far. Good coffee btw. We'll see how the breakfast is.... Wow. I ordered the corned beef hash, potatoes, toast. After I ordered I decided I wanted a croissant. It was all good.  My breakfast experience was much better than my dinner experience. I'll definitely be back!  Below was my first visit: I came here wanting to eat something different and honestly thought the appetizers looked really good. I WAS going to get like 2 or 3 of the appetizers and thats it. Against my better judgment I decided to get a ribeye steak 'medium'. I should have realized that I wasn't at a steakhouse. It was kind of tough and dry. I should have stuck with my first notion and gotten the meatballs and the artichoke hearts appetizers. The staff was nice even tho they were kind of busy. Next time. Next time. ..

This is my go to place for honey hot wings! They definitely have ANY place beat when it comes to their wings. Couple of things you'll notice tho:  1. they charge extra for using debit or credit...strike! with all the business this place does, they should be able to absorb any extra charges for using their debit/credit machine and still come out ahead. 2. if you look at the menu board, it says an order of wings is 10-12 wings (??) I don't know of any place that gives you an approximate amount of wings lol...most places in fact charge by the piece. But mind you, the wings are delicious! I'm not sure about rest of the menu, so you will have to try those out for yourself.

So I came here last Saturday and tried the Cantina chicken burrito and loved it. I came here today and ordered the same thing, and seriously thought I was eating a veggie burrito there was hardly any chicken in it. Boo... not sure what gives

A group of us came to Liberty Market for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. they were slightly busy, but not filled to capacity. They have a great selection on the menu, very unique. I found it hard to choose my entree. I ended up ordering the crab cake, with a side kale salad. After ordering we sat. I was a little disappointed when my plate arrived. The crab cake was pretty small with just a small pinch of lettuce. I thought to myself 'wow, this is small for the price.' (I'm a big guy with large appetite) I asked the server, "that's my kale salad?" he replied "yes sir." I was charged extra 4 dollars for the salad alone. Really disappointing. Then a few minutes later the server returned and apologized and said "sorry sir, THIS is your kale salad." MUCH BETTER! the lettuce on the plate was garnishment! The crab cake was delicious, and so was the salad. While it was a small portion for MY appetite, I ended up leaving satisfied. I will go back. I really like this place.

Hot Dogs don't get any better than when you get them at Ted's Dogs! They really know how to make them there. Plus they make so much more there...they have the Sea Dog, corn dogs, foot longs, hamburgers, French fries and their onion rings are delicious! I can order anything off their menu and not be disappointed!

i love filiberto's. as a hispanic American i think the good is pretty authentic for a chain restaurant. the only thing different locations vary in quality of food. this one is always busy which in my experience means the food will not be old, cold or overcooked. the only problem i've had with this location is that sometimes you can wait for a long (sometimes really long) time for your food. if you are in a hurry be aware of that...

Try the fried calamari for your appetizer and the tuna poke for your entrée yum!  Things to try here. .. The Murphy Roll,  the Lucky Roll, and the Mesa Roll, Apache Roll  we've been coming here for 6 years. we love it. I've never had a bad meal here. while its hard to find good sushi here in the desert, this place is a refreshing place to get your sushi fix

This is the first time i have actually eaten AT a Venezia's. I've had their Pizza on several occasions and it has always been good. This was no exception. Usually thin crusts are so so but theirs is flavorful and not just dry and crunchy. The place was nice and clean. The people were friendly. I was a little put off that the yelp coupon wasn't taken. But then i read that it's not good with certain items. We ordered 5 slices, 1/2 order of wings and 3 drinks $25. Not bad.

This is my second time here. I like the way they team up on my car if they have extra hands available and get it done fast. And they do a good job. I just got my car painted so I don't want the high pressure hoses used on it. They gladly accommodate by using the regular hose. They offered to bundle and save me money when I asked for a detail on the inside.

I have a blue ribbon chili that I make. One of my 'secret ingredients' is the Chorizo from Bill's Market Place! Whenever I make my chili I head over to Bill's and get the fresh chorizo (I can't say if I use the hot or mild, I would be giving my 'secret' away lol) but I love both of them. You can't go wrong when you go here! The family is super friendly too!

OK so I'm still amazed how a place can exist for so long be soooo goood, and me not know about it! This place is family owned and has been here for 30 years. The server is family, he was friendly and went out of his way to make sure I made the right choices. He explained what things were and what they tasted like. He even suggested I NOT order something and try something else. It was a perfect fit for me too! The prices are big, the food is very good, and the portions are bigger than most every other place I've been.  I will definitely be back!!

A friend told me about this place months ago. I just didn't have the opportunity to come here until now. I pulled into the parking lot and was surprised how nice the place was (because of the area I figured it may be somewhat ghetto lol) nice, older, well kept building. Service so far was nice and friendly. Smells good  :) I always have a hard time ordering at a Mexican restaurant, since I'm Mexican I've had it all and I usually end up eating the same thing lol. Well I decided to stray from that this time. That didn't make it an easy decision tho. I saw the same things I saw at every other Mexican place. I decided to look at the appetizers. I ordered Mexican Pizza, because it came with their house made chorizo on it. I wasn't sure if it would be enough to fill me up so I ordered the beef tostada. Well the Mexican Pizza was good sized and delicious. But I wanted to at least try the tostada while it was fresh. Both were really good. The pizza was awesome!  I'll definitely be back.

I haven't eaten here in years and i really don't recall how it is.  just sat down down so I'm not sure how to rate yet, but strike one no coke only pepsi products lol. The house salsa is pretty good. I'm trying something new. They have something like gorditas so we'll see.

out of all of the Filiberto's this is my favorite. they are always busy, which usually means two IMPORTANT things...1) the food is good 2) the food is fresh. another important thing to notice is that you even see hispanic folks eating here, that means it is fairly authentic. you can't beat homemade Mexican food but this is pretty darn close! i like that they play spanish music playing almost all the times i go in there too

Don't come here if you're not able to wait. A long time... from 6am to 8am they have their early bird special when haircuts are half price. It gets packed. And they allow people to call in and put their name on the board. So if you walk in and there's only 2 or 3 people waiting, the board may have 10 names on it. If they walk in after you they'll get called before you if their mane is on the board. And the list gets messed up. One time I waited an hour and a half and was next, a guy walks in and signs on the top of the second column (I was next on the bottom of the first column) the barber calls the wrong name. I just walked out at that point. The haircuts are good but not worth the aggravation

In really surprised I have left a review of this place sooner! I honestly thought I had. I guess when I get here I know that the food will be great! This is the place for great Asian food (in my opinion is the best srsly) and the prices are very reasonable. VERY. So if you're on a budget this is your place. This is not the place if you're in a hurry or wanting a nice and modern atmosphere. This place is authentic and because of that it's busy. REALLY busy. The decor is somewhat 'Sandford and Son meets Jackie Chan' I mean that in the nicest way possible lol. The people are friendly and the customers usually understand the wait times. I love this place, srsly. I highly recommend.   *The one thing that bothers me is that I wish the restrooms were cleaner. But that's what home is for right?

I cant answer about the Cheese Steaks because I've only had one here once. It was really good but I can't compare it to anywhere else cuzz I don't usually eat them. But this place has awesome wings and zucchini! The price is a little higher than other places even their combos. But you'll leave satisfied even tho your wallet will be lighter lol

You really can't go wrong eating here. Just be prepared to wait a while to be seated. Don't fret tho, they have a good bar to get a drink from while you are waiting. You just may hear the band play while you are waiting for your drink! You will usually hear bluesy and jazzy type of music here. I like the decor of the place, old, southern junkyard is what I call it for lack of a better term. Hubcaps, signs, chain link like fences separating the rooms. They have EXCELLENT beef ribs! Add their great potato salad to that and you just may experience the big O while you are there lol

I was introduced to San Tan Brewing Company by my niece and nephew. They always know where the good places are and San Tan Brewing Co. was no exception! The food was good, they had TV's and good beer. It is a good place to meet up with friends and family or to have HH with coworkers. It's located in Chandler's Town Square which just adds to the coolness. As you walk in you can see the huge tanks where they brew their own delicious beers. I also like the vintage p.o. boxes that they have converted into benches you can sit on while you wait for your table. Nice touch!

i've eaten at Pete's for 30 years...can beat their 'Pete's' sauce, it's awesome, and without the sauce the food isn't that great. the quality has gone up and down thru the years. i'm not sure why, i guess maybe management? same with the service. they have pretty much owned the corner of Mesa Dr and Main St, so i think they take for granted that people will go there no matter how rude the staff is and how bad the food is. Ok, it's not AWFUL, but it's not really seafood, it only vaguely resembles it. so here are reasons to find another place to eat: 1. they only take cash. what? really? i've eaten food from FOOD TRUCKS that accept credit cards... 2. they don't accept bills over a twenty...what if 4 people have an order of say $40? nope! better have your twenty dollah bills y'all 3. they only have outdoor seating. even when it's 115 degrees outside, or raining. 4. there are no restrooms. what restaurant doesn't have restrooms? guess you better not eat there if you have the little ones with you... 5. they EXPECT you to clean up after yourself. and they have it POSTED! (your mother doesn't work here) for this reason, i usually leave my plates, cups and napkins on the table when i leave. i know that may be rude, but how else can you ensure that those tables are being cleaned like they are supposed to be?? 6. lastly they are not open on Sundays. most places these days are open 7 days a week. i respect that they do not open on Sundays, it's family values and all...but that just gives the general public the chance to find a place to eat that is actually worth their time and money.  my summation: i only go to Pete's when i'm in a hurry, am driving thru the area, have cash in my pocket, and there isn't any other alternative. which is very, very seldom...

This place was awesome, the decor was very nice. The staff was very friendly. And the food was great. I loved the flat bread and bread loaf they brought to the table. Bruschetta Quattro appetizer was really good. I had the Pasta Pesto, but asked if I could have some alfredo sauce on the side. They obliged me on that. It's definitely a place to go for a special occasion. And we definitely go back.

Just when I think that we have enough burger joints and we need to axe 'em all, I go back and visit In-N-Out Burger! They are still tough to beat. Their fresh, never frozen burgers still keep me coming back. While all the new burger places claim some gimmick or another, In-N-Out just has good friendly service, great burgers, good fries (not my favorite, but still pretty decent) and a simple menu. They always keep the place nice and clean. The crowds speak for themselves!

I came here to see Pat Benatar in their concert venue and MAN! I'll never go to a concert in a big venue again! This place is the perfect size. You're not too far from the stage anywhere in there. And they have 2 or 3 bars there (not sure how many because I had a few shots already lol) the lines are not long at all. Then there's the casino there so you can walk off all the shots that you took at the concert! Or the hotel in case you keep taking shots! Also i like the casino because it has landmarks inside so i don't get lost haha. I'm a local and i love this place, if i was an out of state visitor this would be my choice to stay. It's super nice. And has a non smoking section

Who am I kidding. I can give Walmart a low rating but will I go back? Of course! Walmart has everything. You name it, they have it, and that's the best thing about them is that you can pick up automotive parts, electronics, toys, furniture and go grocery shopping all under the same roof! Just beware! I'm sure you've heard of the old adage: you get what you pay for. Meaning, if you skimp on price, you'll skimp on quality. Walmart is a perfect example of this! Even on their 'higher end' products that you can find at true higher end stores, Walmart must get the bottom of the barrel ones and pass the savings (ie lower quality) on to you...but if you are on a tight budget Walmart is the place for you. Just don't complain when you have to replace what you bought after a year...

i was eating lunch in this little mall when i saw this barber/beauty shop. i needed a haircut, the price was right (very reasonable). even tho the place was a bit crowded i was in and out in like 30 minutes. I asked for a shampoo and rinse AFTER my cut so i wouldn't have hair all over my neck and back itching me. the barber was happy to oblige. the actual haircut was ok. nothing that stands out in my mind, but what do you expect for $12?

i've had a big issue with their tuesday night 'wing' night prices going up so now i just go whenever i want wings since they are basically the same price as the rest of the week and usually better then too. they added a new flavor of wings 'Salt and Vinegar'! i tried and i liked! then i had a hankering for dessert so i tried the Bacon Fried sundae...yes it is BACON and ice cream! maple syrup covered then deep fried, in a cup of french vanilla ice cream...YUM!

So we all know that Chinese buffets are every where these days. But this one really is the best one I've been to. The crab legs are awesome here, seriously. The rest of the buffet has a large selection. The mongollian grill could be expanded but it passes for good. You will usually have to wait for a table, but don't fret, that just means that the food will be fresh for you! the place is bright, clean and up to date. This should be your choice for all you can eat Chinese.

I'm pretty sure the toilet overflowed right before I walked in here. I'm not being mean, it really smelled like they had plumbing issues. So if they were that's probably a freak thing, and doesn't affect the rest of my review, which wasn't very good by the way... This place is definitely not worth your time and especially your money honestly. Take it from a Hispanic who LOVES tacos, burritos etc...I can name five places within five miles that are way better for the price. The Burrito I ordered was large but hardly contained any beef (I ordered a carne asada burrito). It also had rice, guacamole, pico de gallo. and it was flimsy, burritos are not supposed to fall apart lol, the salsa was meh...the reason I think they may get a lot of business is because of the location. It's right on the corner of Rural and University. How can it not get business being located there? It's a college student hangout because they live within walking distance, close for when they are hungry... Spend a little on gas or the bus and go up the street.

I have been coming here for a couple of years now and I can't say that I have ever had a bad experience. If you want an authentic Asian experience Mekong Palace is the place. It's located in a little old fashioned mall, I call it 'the Asian mall' because all of the stores are Asian of some sort. They have a grocery store, a t-mobile store, a barber shop (which I also go to and like), an insurance agent, a travel agent, a food court, with several other restaurants that have dim sum, etc.... All serving the Asian community. My favorite is the big restaurant named after the mall itself, 'Mekong Palace Restaurant'. They also have a hot pot area, which I like too. You choose the broth and the different additional ingredients; meat, veggies, noodles etc. One thing I haven't seen is Sushi. But the variety is not lacking otherwise. So if you want the area's closest thing to a Chinatown come here. You won't be disappointed!

Recently brought here after church by my niece and nephew (they always take me different places lol) I fell in love with this place! I've never really been a fan of bbq, but this place is really good. They have 3 signature bbq sauces. 1. Regular 2. Spicy 3. Sweet, They have great beef brisket and pulled pork. Kids eat free on Sundays, that's nice for me and other families who want to have a nice lunch on Sunday without breaking their bank account. I get full with the 'Westerner' which has 2 meats and is like 8 inches long, can't beat that! Oh, Free ice cream too!!

This is a great place to get tasty Colombian cuisine. They are very friendly, they have big screens. The food is really good, and they have really good drinks. Great place to go for Latino food and have a change from Mexican food (which I love) but is so prevalent here in AZ. The food is not so spicy, but is very flavorful. It's in a small shopping center, so it has a store front feel to it, but it's worth a visit.

So basically the coupon is worthless because the cashier said that you have to buy 5 washes in order to get the $ $5 discount. And people who don't have the Yelp app get the same price. Not that yours or anyone special LOL but why have the coupon anyway? Anyway the service was okay the best thing about it was it was fast butt they only have two car washes and none of them include the interior. At least before 9 a.m. on a Sunday when the detailer comes in. I may go back if I just need a quick wash without the interior being done but I'm not sure

If I could give zero stars I would. I know that may be harsh, and I don't mean to offend anyone but this place seriously needs a visit from the health dept. The food here is mediocre at best and the best food here is the processed foods. The Mongolian cook never cleared the grill between meals and didn't cook them anywhere near in order. I saw him pick food out of the trap and put it on the dish that he served to a customer! After I saw that, I knew I had better stay away from the sushi, right next to the Mongolian grill. It didn't appear that he was even remotely trying to cook the food in any kind of order.  I was first in a line of 6 people who brought their food to him to cook, but I received my food last. LAST. The place is dark and dingy and looked mid-evil, it doesn't look like the place had been DEEP cleaned since this place was a steak house...but the last straw was when I went to use the men's room (which I had to do before I left the place considering what I had just eaten here) the only lights in the men's room were above the sinks, the toilets were in a separate area...and they were lit by BLACK lights...! Is this a reference to the food you consume here???

Bring a crowd with you,  This Place is great fun!  Went here for my birthday 2013. I'll gladly go here again for the next big occasion. Our chef was ***** great, and funny too. He made the whole group laugh and he was good at tossing and chopping the food.  The food was *** nothing specatular but good.  The whole experience was A+ if you want a memorable time for your bday or anniversary or whatever occasion it may be.   I didn't go to the sushi side, but that may be a place to go sometime for happy hour...

So I've seen this place before and heard good things about it as well. To come here is a totally different thing. You'll notice that they're friendly, the food is fresh and they are just good people.  The building is not new and not 'trendy'. But it's very clean. They seem to be concerned with getting you a fresh, hot meal with a smile. You see the cooks at the grill making your food which is always nice. I would not hesitate to come back here.

not a big fan of chain sushi restaurants, this place falls into that category. This a cookie cutter sushi place. I went here only because someone else was paying. If I'm paying I usually spring for more quality where the chef puts a little more soul into his craft.  If you want better sushi try a real sushi bar.

This place has a great menu and is also a great time too. We basically had appetizers and dessert while we listened to the band this time. But the food is delicious too!

OK so I haven't gotten my food yet but the selection looks good. These days I have to eat healthy. They have a good variety of salads with meat... even a steak salad! I ordered the garden salad replaced the turkey with grilled chicken.   So here's the nice touch...I had just picked up my dog from the groomer and was hungry. I looked up places with outdoor seating and found this place. I called ahead to see if it was ok to bring my dog Desiree. The guy said of course. When I arrived I just walked directly to the patio which is right by this pond with ducks and swans. Really cool. A couple of minutes later the host brought me a glass of water AND HE BROUGHT MY DOG A BOWL OF WATER! one of the patrons came out for a smoke and actually asked if I minded if he smoked while me and Des sat there. This place has definitely got themselves a return customer!  **edit: so I sat there and ate my healthy chicken salad which was ok sized and delicious but was still hungry so I ordered some chicken wings which I found out were discounted because of happy hour... Happy hour IS ALL day on Saturdays! *chuh-ching! I wondered what my dog was so enamored with and noticed the pond was filed with big fish and even a turtle that crawled up the rock! What an awesome dinner! (No my dog didn't eat the fish or turtles lol). ***edit 10/3/15 me and my dog came closer to 1pm this time and the food was just as delicious if not better. Service was great as usual. One of these days I'm going to have to eat indoors here. It looks awesome lol...

My niece turned me on to this place. I'm glad she did! This is great comfort food and a nice place to engage in good convo. If you're in the downtown Mesa area catching a concert, musical or hitting up first Friday, stop in here and try this place. The food is great.

This place was awesome! The hamburger was juicy and delicious. I had the, well I can't remember the one I had, but it had mushrooms and an awesome sauce on it. The Parmesan fries were delicious too. I drank their house made soda (blueberry flavor!) only like 3 refills! The staff was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely go back!

So I had an extra early am appt before work and was done quickly. Consequently I was way early for work and wanted to stop and have a sit down breakfast. Of course I turn to yelp since I was in an unfamiliar area. It's hard to find a good old fashioned diner instead of coffee joints these days. The first place I stopped was a coffee joint...*strike* the counter guy was nice but that'll be another review lol. Next I found Joe's Diner. I walked in about 0645 and there were about 4 other diners seated. It smelled slightly musty probably because they just mopped so I can't complain about that. It's nice and clean inside. The smell didn't last at all and wasn't overbearing The server was very friendly.  I received a menu, items are very well priced ($ as posted on yelp) I decided on the corn beef hash because it came with 3 eggs and 1 biscuit and gravy. When the food came I received the eggs and b&g but got a slice of ham instead of the corn beef hash. She was apologetic and took and replaced it. She left the biscuit and gravy so could start with that, which I might say was *awesome!* I asked for the chorizo gravy, and so should you :-) then the eggs and corn beef hash came and I almost passed out out was so good! I only wish I lived closer to this place so I could come here more often!!!

what can I say? this place has delicious food. I ordered a carne asada burrito and a fish taco. I sat outside next to the grill which made my experience even better. before I started my review I had already wolfed down my fish taco so I didn't get a picture of it lol. the burrito was just as good tho!  they do charge extra for debit or credit cards tho but that's the only negative I could find about this place

I actually didn't go the cubs park, I went to Riverview Park attached to Cubs park. I take my dog Desiree to the dog park there. She loves it, and of course if she loves it, I love it! there are 2 areas specifically for dogs there. The only problem is that the one  where I take Desiree has no benches to sit or fences to separate the area from the other where people like to play football or soccer. I'm not sure about the other one because I haven't actually been there. But the park itself is great. It has fishing ponds and several paths to walk, also kids play areas and a water play area. They keep the place pretty clean, and they are still building more to it.

I don't know why it took me so long to come here. They have been here for decades. My experience was really awesome. The food was delicious.  There was this older gentleman on the stage singing great tunes. Nice touch. It was my first time here and the server caught on to that and told me she would bring me samples of (3things) which i thought was awesome. From that i was able to decide what to order. I will definitely be back

I'm a former fan of 'another' chain of theaters here in the valley. Actually I really didn't care AMC at all. That is until I came here to this AMC! The atmosphere was awesome, I like being able to choose your own seat. They are fully reclining seats now too!! The sound has definitely improved in this new AMC, I'm definitely a AMC theater goer now :)

I am a HUGE fan of this place, and with good reason too. I know it's a bar, and the beer is really good, but the food menu is even better! I like the freedoms that the chef takes with the daily special. Every daily special is different from the next. One of the draws (maybe a drawBACK for some people) of this place is that they have NO TV'S. The reasoning is that they want you to talk to the people you came with, what a novel idea!

ok. so they are doing somethings right i guess. they are friendly, the place is clean. they have a pretty creative, extensive menu. that said i wasn't impressed enough to ever go back. i went there because i was walking my dog and wanted to stop for lunch they had outdoor seating so i thought i'd give it a shot. they are very chintsy (if that's even a word lol) with their dressings. my sandwich was mostly bread. i had the Count of Monte Chase-O sandwich which features ham, turkey, swiss cheese and strawberry preserves. unique huh? you couldn't tell, like i said, i tasted only the bread. if they would be even a little more generous with the lettuce, onions, meats and condiments. i like a sandwich that is as much on my face as it is in my mouth. this wasn't it. nothing fell out of this sandwich!

So I've been here before. A loooong time ago. I only come here when my coworker wants it and i fly for it. This place is so overrated.  When you come in your greeted by a glum person at the counter.  I only come here for breakfast, of course they only have 3 breakfast sandwiches. And ONE of them is vegetarian!  They have a side of potatoes, oh but only on Saturdays and after 1030. They're called welcome chicken and donuts but they have no chicken sandwiches on the breakfast menu. You have to come after 1030 for that... What are you welcome to? A soup kitchen? You can eat only what they have at that time...they serve certain things at certain times...Even though their 'claim' to fame is chicken...today they had a whole rack of chicken just sitting there behind the counter...at 855am. But they're not serving it until after 1030...

What can i say about this place? They're awesome! I had their Italian chef salad, which was very good and of ample portions. For dessert I tried a chocolate chip cookie. It tasted homemade! They are all very friendly. It's no wonder why they were busy and had many return customers (i heard a girl worker tell an older couple "good to see you, you don't usually come here on Sundays!") They know their customers:) I will definitely be back

I walked in to a calm but clean establishment. The customer flow was steady while I was there. The owner  (I think it was the owner) was doing paperwork at a table but made sure that the counter person served me right away. I ordered a beef hot bowl but couldn't decide on my choice of base so I asked if I could have half of two, the noodles and spinach. They obliged. On top of that you get four other add ins (+. 50 for each additional). Then you choose which sauce you want it cooked in. I chose the sweet and spicy.They served it up fresh and quickly. It was a little light on the beef but still really good. The bowls are usually $7.95 but for the Grand opening they are $6. Cha-ching! Great food and a great price! I'll be back

This place is actually surprisingly good. As you walk in here you might expect a shabby remodel, but it looks pretty classy. They did a great job making it look like their own instead of a cheap take over building. And the sushi is pretty good. Especially in comparison to other sushi places close by. Among their creative menu they carry Uni which is my favorite type of sushi. And most other places don't usually have it.  I've been here a couple of times and have not been disappointed.

Attention all my Arizona people! Are you sitting down? Well sit down! I'm going to brag to you about a new place i just found up the street. It's called Mv Snacks. It's all about Mexican style sushi and snacks. I saw this place last weekend and I had a hunch that it was going to be good. Man was I right! And what an understatement! The food was great and the concept is original. The place was clean and the employees were friendly. I had a chance to meet the owner. She has good business acumen and she's sharp. But lest you get the idea that she's new to the business think again. She's been catering for close to half a decade. And the proof is in the product. Check out my photos but most importantly give them a try! And remember, you heard it here first!
