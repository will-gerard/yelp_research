The Old Spaghetti Factory has such a fun atmosphere.  We've gone twice and both times were sat in these booths that were like little rooms.  I loved it!    It's a really great place for kids, especially with these little booth rooms.  The food didn't really leave an impression on me, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing though, it can't all be good.

Hands down BEST pinatas I've found in the valley.   A few years ago my favorite pinata store went out of business and I haven't been able to find a replacement up until recently. I throw lots of parties and love having a pinata for any occasion. When I'm looking for a pinata I usually visit multiple stores looking for something specific. What I find is the same old thing and more often than not- covered in dust.   When I first walked into Pico Rico I was so please with the selection. Every row I went down I saw something new. There were plenty of varieties so even if it's not for a kids birthday party you'll find something great. Whenever I go back they always have new pinatas I hadn't seen before and something special for whatever holiday is near. The Christmas pinata I bought there was beautiful and unique, I got compliments on it. Their pinatas are very well made. I stuff them with at least 15 lbs. of goodies and they always hold up. On cheaper pinatas the wire will come out when there's too much weight inside.   Other than pinatas they also have a huge selection of Mexican candy, some decorations and balloons. The staff is friendly and helpful. Even though this store is bright fuchsia it's still hard to miss so keep your eyes peeled when driving by.

5 star reviews aren't just for the fanciest places on Earth.  Oh no.  5 stars within a class.  Bandaids is in it's own class of dirty, run down, last stop stripper establishments and within that class, Bandaids is primo.    I've never had a bad time here.  Never.

It took me a while to bring myself to stop by this place.  From the outside it looks questionable.  I finally went for a splurge on my bday this year and dove into their huge apple fritter.  I go into a sugar coma afterwards but I don't care, it's way too good - so soft and crunchy and appley all at the same time.  I stop by every once in a while when I'm feeling naughty.  The only other thing I've tried was the croissant ham & egg bfast sandwich... it makes a great hangover bfast.  I'd recommend bringing cash though, they charge for using cc.  About $10 bucks covers everything the hubs and I want including drinks.

Amazing service, I'm very happy with the job Sierra did on my hardwood floors.  A sewage leak caused my hardwood floors to be torn up but instead of removing them so that they could be used again, the plumber did a total hack job on the floor.  I tried getting an estimate on repairing the floor from another company and they told me it was impossible to fix the floor but they could add another wood floor on top of the existing one, it was ridiculous.  I remember driving by Sierra Hardwood Floors - it's also in Coronado.  I've seen their truck working on homes in the neighborhood.  I gave them a call and they were there the same day.  They were able to fix the floor and the repair is seamless.

My husband lived in England and had a strong reccomendation on this place because of the food.  We didn't make it that far.    When we walked in everything look dirty- the floors, walls, booths, pool tables - and the place was dimly lit!  I could not believe this bar served food.  Nothing about it said restaurant.  The decor was everything British which may have been cute if they took a rag and wipe the dust off.  No one greeted us when we walked in so we just sat down at a table.  There was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did.  She finally came over and gave us some menus, took our drink order and that was it... we never saw her again.  While we waited we had a while to look over the menu.  All the British food sounded like some type of variation of pot roast.  I guess that's what British cuisine consists of but none of it sounded appealing.  Still waiting it gave me more time to look around and I started to get angry because I couldn't believe I was about to order food from such a dirty establishment (I could only imagine what the kitchen looked like).  I was shocked to see kids running around... I wouldn't take Bebe's kids in there.   I clocked it; for 15 minutes we sat there without food or drinks, just menus.  Our booth faced the bar and the bartenders looked at us a few times but never sent anyone over to our table. Could I have asked for our server?  Sure.  But by this point I knew I wasn't spending a dime here and wanted to see how long it would take someone to come over to us so I could tell what I thought of their service.  Finally we receded, parched and starving we got up and left the George & Dragon.  What a waste of time!

If you cut me, I'll bleed havarti and brie cheese, that's how much I love the stuff!  I stopped by Cheese 'n Stuff to find some nice wedges for a cheese plate.  The father daughter duo working the counter were seasoned pro's at working long line that forms around lunchtime.  I also ordered a sandwich for lunch and it was packed with meat and cheese, the bread was soft and doughy like all subs should have.  I'll be back for sure!

I've been hanging out with my flamboyant and fabulous gay uncle a lot lately.  His heyday was in the 80's when he rocked frayed daisy dukes with tan legs and a bare furry chest and used mascara on his mustache.  Most of our time is spent dancing to 80's songs or rummaging through sale items to find good deals.  He brought me along to his favorite record store and it was such a blast from the past.  I dig it when people are really into their record collections, it's rare.  The place is very laid back and the person working there welcomes questions and won't make you feel like a noob for not knowing about the wax.  They have a great 80's selection and my uncle ended up buying some Tina Turner to go along with his wig.

If nothing else, you should visit Pomeroy's because there works the world's best bartender, Charlie.  A master of his craft, Charlie may also be the world's best grilled cheese chef.  I've watched him make them, he gives a shit.  Happy hour has 2 for 1 domestics on tap.  You know how some uptight bars won't serve you more than one drink at a time?  Oh no, not Pomeroy's.  They hand you two picture perfect ice frosted mugs filled with your favorite brew and you realize this place isn't for amateurs.

This place is ALWAYS a great time.  They have great bands roll through and the cover charge isn't bad either.  I come here whenever I feel like dancing the night away, there's always room on the floor.  As for the d√©cor, it's a bit of a dive, it has the feel of a legion club or something along those lines.  Aside from that, the crowd is cool and everyone is quick to make friends and join in friendly, fun-loving conversations.    Drinks are stiff and they always have specials... plus $2 PBR, just sayin.

I usually only buy beauty products at a department store or Sephora but ULTA is a lot closer, I run there when I'm in a jam.  I would consider the shopping experience here a small step up from Walgreens.  It has the necessities but not the items you never knew you needed.  Very small selection of brand named make-up, skin care and perfumes.  Over priced hair care and hair accessories.  I'm always bummed out when I walk around.  As for the staff, can't stand them.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by other places that like to tell you what's new, which items come with gifts or help you pick a color.  Nope, not ULTA.  There's usually ONE girl working the register, no matter how big the line.  The rest of the staff is coagulated by this counter in between the make-up and hair salon.  I have no idea what purpose that counter serves because they're all clustered around it, putting make-up on each other and gossiping about the girl at the register - you know, the one actually working.  The one time I did actually pull one away to ask for help with liquid eye liner she handed me one of those pencil eyeliners that don't need to be sharpened.  Ugh, thanks for nuthin'.

The Swizzle Inn, a five star dive.  It's like comfort food, bad for your health but also very comforting.    If you find yourself in the position of having a designated driver and really want to tie one on without judgemental eyes holding you back - come to the Swizz!  You could fall off your bar stool and hop right back up without anyone blinking an eye.

I love bookstores in general.  Something about the smell of the printed word, leafing through books, I could spend hours in there, um, I actually do spend hours in there.    It's crazy that Bookstar is my favorite bookstore in the valley.  It's not large, there's no coffee chain attached to it, it doesn't even have comfortable chairs to sit in while I read books.  Nonetheless, it's my favorite.  I think it may be a discount bookstore, I'm not sure but the prices are always reasonable.  Most of the time I always know what book I'm going to buy when I walk in but sometimes I just want to roam around and find something unexpected.  Bookstar is the perfect size for roaming.  I've come to realize that I can't handle all the variety of the larger bookstores.  I get overwhelmed by all the options and I make rash decisions then end up loathing my purchase.  Bookstar is never crowded.  You can always find parking in one of the first couple of spots.  Sometimes less is more and Bookstar is the perfect example of that.

That's right, it is woohoo as good as it gets!  This place is perfect for a celebration dinner with some special people.  After it was over, I wanted to bring everyone I love here to have a great experience - it's that freaking good!  The food was excellent.  The table shared some mozzarella & prosciutto and caprese.  I had the scialatielli alle vongole, the handmade pasta was out of this world delicious and top it off with amazing clams *drool*.  Oh, I can't forget the wine, the wine was actually the best part believe it or not, I can't recall all the names because like I said, it was a celebration dinner, but one stuck out "CUM LAUDE" haha, it still makes me giggle.  The service was also excellent, that coupled with the romantic decor and ambiance make this a 5 star dinning establishment, well, in my opinion anyway.

I had forgotten about this place but I worked in the area in my early twenties and some coworkers and I would frequent this place for their awesome lunch specials.    I came here recently while staying  Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak at the for an alternative to the terrible frozen pizza they serve.  Call it in, 8 mins round trip from the hotel. Delicious pizza.

There is a really large selection of different plants and trees. Half of them aren't labeled or priced. So unless you know exactly what you're looking for you may need to grab a worker... if you can find one. Aside from the cashier the only worker I saw was in the parking lot. I enjoyed walking around and looking at the wide variety of plants but I couldn't help but notice that every nook and cranny was stuffed with random crap. Every turn had revealed more gardening tools and materials, it looked junkie. I went to Whitfill for flowers which I usually buy at Home Depot but I wanted nursery quality, if there is such a thing. The same flowers were 4 times the price than Home Depot. I decided I wasn't willing to pay nursery prices and left empty handed.

I've been flying out of or into this place my entire life.  Never a bad experience.    Be careful though - the north curb and south curb throw a lot of people off when you're trying to pick someone up.  Make sure you clarify.

This tile store has an amazing selection on unique tile.  While searching all over the valley for a decorative tile piece for underneath the chandelier, we happened upon this place.  The showroom was incredible.  Beautiful and unique tile lay on display.  Then there was a back room with even more creative flooring and counter solutions.  They owner happened to be working when we came in and he noticed our enthusiasm toward his awesome showroom.  He took us to the workshop and showed us these gorgeous glass counter tops, in my opinion, so much more beautiful than granite or marble.  To sweeten the pot, he gave us some sample coasters.   Unfortunately, they were unable to get in the tile piece that we wanted in time, we only had a few days to lay the tile.  Nonetheless, I will choose this place for all my tiling needs in the future.  Those counter tops have my name all over them.

I actually did a lot of research before picking this place. Having one bad experience was enough to learn my lesson and not let the hospital coordinator choose the assisted living facility. I was about to learn another huge lesson: high ratings on a website means nothing.   Life Care Center smells like urine as soon as you walk in and you better know where you're going and have a room number because you can't ever find someone that works there. This place is more rest home than rehab...what am I saying, this is a nursing home. The rehab this facility offers is a joke. They wheel out their patients into the hallway and they sit there ALL DAY never getting changed and reeking of urine. It's a pretty sad scene, I cried the first time I came to visit my loved one here and started working immediately to get them out of that horrible place. After a few days of fighting with the insurance company, they won and we had to settle in that crap hole for 4 months.  With only our sense of humor to fall back on we started calling it skid row for seniors.    The food was horrible.  The rehab was nonexistent.  I had a really bad experience in a meeting with the director, head nurse and physical therapist but it gave me a better understanding of why this facility is so mismanaged.  The nurses try to put everyone in these "protection pants", the best way I can describe them is as a cushioned chastity belt.  Apparently they are supposed to protect you from injuring yourself when you fall but I believe they use them because they keep the urine from leaking everywhere.  We declined signing the consent to wear the pants and the orderly whispered "good, these poor people are too dim witted to know what they are signing".

This review is specifically for the trail off 24th street.  I train for the Grand Canyon on this trail and I believe it's the perfect spot for training because as soon as you leave the parking lot you being to ascend the mountain.  During the week I'd hike before work and all I had time for was a mile in and a mile out.  On the weekends though was my time to explore the mountain and test my stamina.    The only downside is the mountain bikers.  Like a good little hiker I always give them the right-of-way but I've nearly been run down by these fools a couple of times.

I come here religiously to get the oil changed in my bosses Cadillac.  At this point, I know more about that car than anyone else in the world.  I know how many miles it's at and how many more miles to go until it needs the oil changed, the tires rotated, the fuel system cleaned and when it needs a new air filter - it's sure as hell not every single time I bring it in!   It never fails though that they pull out that perfectly white air filter and tell me I need a new one.   I use to quip back "it's recommend that the filter be changed every 15,000 miles, it's only been 4,500."  I'm past that point, now I just give them the "I take no bullshit" look and they say "you know on second thought, it doesn't need to be replaced."  I'm sick of these guys but my boss insists I go here and he always gets what he wants.

I have this taste in my mouth of what a margherita pizza should taste like.  I've been in search of it for years. Sadly, this place did not measure up to what I had in mind but it was still delicious pizza.  Everything taste fresh, the sauce, the dough, the toppings, yum!    I've been here twice, once for lunch and another time for a takeout order.  Everything went smoothly on the take out order, while I waited I got to see the kitchen staff in action, they really work hard!  When I came in for a sit down meal, the food and service were great.  It did take a long time to get our food though so I don't recommend coming here for lunch if you're on a time crunch.  They get very busy.

You can get all the things here cheaper on the internet.  However, sometimes you don't have anytime to waste waiting for things to arrive in the mail.  Lakeshore has great learning material and helpful aids to teach children of all ages.  They staff is friendly and helpful and they do have good sales occasionally.

I was pleasantly surprised by this place, the reviews aren't that great but I had a lot of fun here.  There was live music and dancing.  Our server was awesome and a guy came by and did a magic show for us while we waited for our food.  There was TONS of food - bread, lots of sides, there's no way you're not going home without a togo box.  To eat I had the shrimp which was pretty good.  Then complimentary cotton candy for dessert!  The view was fantastic.  This has got to be one of the best places for a family meal - it's quite an experience!

This is my favorite buffet in all of Arizona!    It's really clean bright inside, rare for buffets.  My favorite things are the little sushi bar, crab legs, and the teppan table. I've never had a bad experience at this place, really nice people work here.  It's also good for a group of people.

This place disappoints.  One time I came in and they stuffed my bagel and lox with so many capers that it inedible, I had to flick them all off.  The last time I came in (and I do mean last) there were a group of teens working... well not actually working but standing around talking and playing tricks on each other.  When they finished making my bagel they just let it sit there and didn't bother calling my name.  I had to interrupt them and ask them if I could have my bagel.  It's disappointing because I use to come in this place often and the service was quick and friendly but they must be under new management now.

I just had some windows installed for my new house and you know what they need?  Curtains!  I've searched high and low for just the right curtains that compliment my freshly painted walls.  I have had no luck.  The problem is that all the stores seem to have the same style.  I need something different and unique like Monique.    Home Fabrics has a great selection of fabric that got me excited!  Luckily, I have a sewing machine and curtains are the easiest thing to make.  My search for curtains ended here!

This is literally the best oil change experience I've ever had.  No matter where I live in the valley I vow to always make the trek to this place to get my oil changed.  Their excellent customer service and meticulous attention to detail has made me a customer for life.  I've paid three times the price for an oil change at other places and the service I received couldn't even compare to Stinky's.  The best part is that it's family owned so you can leave here feeling good about spending your money at a local business!

I'm not going to pretend to know what authentic Hawaiian food is supposed to taste like but my ex-boyfriend is from there and says this place is the real deal. He use to take me to eat here all the time and I loved it. So when I had a luau I knew I had to come here for some manapua and beef sticks. Aloha kitchen did not disappoint. I placed a large order of both and everything was delish and went smoothly.

The best first date I've ever been on - a moonlight hike around Lost Dutchman Park.  I've never hiked this area because I hike alone and Lost Dutchman always gives me an eerie feeling when I'm close by.  I think that eerie feeling combined with the fact that it was dark and we were only led by the light of the full moon gave the date much more excitement.      We took the Siphon Draw to the Green Boulder Trail and it was very long, maybe two miles and not difficult.  The weather was perfect and the moon reflecting off the jagged peaks and saguaros looked stunning, very romantic.  The smell of the desert and its sounds - they seemed to be present more so at night.  I've been on hikes at night before but nothing like this, I don't know if it was because I was in good company and he was so knowledgeable and respectful of nature that it heightened my senses or what but it was such a wonderful and unique adventure.  Fellas, if your lady likes to hike, take her here.  This sweet man said he had to wait longer than he would have liked to ask me out because he wanted there to be a full moon for our perfect first date.

The last time I went rollerskating I was 13.   So, when my friend asked me to tag along with her I jumped at the chance.  I had the best time here!  Skating is so much fun!  Not just that, people watching was great too.  We were here for a school function and watching all the little kids learn how to skate was adorable.  They provide "walkers" for new skaters and that really seemed to make a difference.  I had a smile on my face the entire time.  The music was great and pumping, a lot of the same songs from my workout playlist.  Even though the sound system was great, when the DJ hopped on the mic he sounded like Woodstock -- very entertaining when it came time to play games.  As far as the surroundings, I didn't expect much coming to this Skateland.  I mean, I'm sure there haven't been any rollerskating rinks built in the past 20 years and I doubt any of them are doing well enough to be remodeled.  So I wasn't disappointed to see everything painted neon colors and dated back to the 80's but it was clean, the skates were in good condition.  The snack bar charged $2.50 for a large soda which kinda chapped my hide but when you take into consideration how cheap the entrance and skate rentals were, I didn't mind.  I can't wait to come back!

Experiences like this one are the reason I joined Yelp - just so incredibly frustrated by service that I wanted to tell everyone "Hey, don't go here unless you have the desire to bend over and take it up the ass."  I have more than a few reviews that exclaim my love for my iphone.  If I could melt it on a silver spoon and mainline it, I would.  For various reasons I've had seven iphones over the years, three I had to purchase as replacements from the Apple store which is what brought me to this location. The first two replacements I purchased from the Apple store, one in Lancaster, PA and the other from the Apple store at San Tan, both experiences were seamless and literally took under 15 minutes, each time I remember leaving there with a smile on my face because I was so please with my service and my new phone.  Unfortunately, my iphone keeled over and died and I tried to get in to the Apple store at San Tan but they were booked until the next day.  So I decided to go to this location because I couldn't live without my phone for that long, I was starting to itch.  I made an appointment for 6:00 pm and met with Jorge rather quickly.  I brought my laptop with me so he could help me sync my phone since I could access it, he did.  He left while my phone was syncing and said he'd be back in 45 minutes to check on me.  Um, okay, I guess syncing takes 43 minutes longer at this Apple store than the rest of the world.  He went on to help other people and I waited for him - this set the tone for the rest of the evening, he would come back, look at my phone for a couple of minutes then walk off and help someone else.  Since I spent over an hour there, mainly waiting on Jorge, I had plenty of time to observe the place, this store isn't as bright an shiny as the other Apple stores I've been to, the white walls had scuff marks all over them, the place looked old and used - so did the staff.   There was one guy running around asking people if they needed help and I was like "damn, I wish I could have gotten him" but everyone else looked like they were practicing for the 2013 Zombie Walk.    Finally I get my new phone and I was like "cool, fire it up Jorge" and he hands it back to me and tells me to activate it and walks off.  This had never happened before, usually the guys are so excited to activate the phone, like they're bringing a baby unicorn into the world or something, not this dude.  I plug it in go through the prompts and no dice, it wouldn't activate.  I stand there and wait for him to come back around like I have been all evening and when he does, he tells me that I need to go home and activate my phone and that's when I hit my breaking point.  I didn't come down here and wait an hour, spend $170 bucks just to leave with a nonworking phone.  He told me they didn't set up iphones there.  I called bullshit!  So then he took my phone, walked off to supposedly activate it, came back later and told me it was working.  I grabbed it and left.  He didn't activate it,  he lied to me, I'm sure I knew that but what was I going to do, cause a big scene and tell him he's a worthless liar?  Meh  Anyway, I called Verizon when I got home and received the best possible service and they walked me through activating my phone.  You know it's a cold day in hell when you get better service from Verizon than you do from the Apple store.

You couldn't ask for a better vet than Dr. Todd, he's freaking awesome.    I noticed Greg the desert tortoise had a soft shell when I picked him up to clean out his habitat.  I freaked.  It was a Saturday evening and I called around to find somewhere to take him.  The 24 hour vet hospital doesn't take exotic animals.  I googled his symptoms and his condition sounded grave.  I turned to Yelp and found Avian and called first thing Monday morning for an appointment.  I was able to be seen the same day.  The office visit was only $55.  The receptionist and vet tech were super friendly.  Dr. Todd is a wealth of knowledge regarding desert tortoises and I'm sure all other reptiles.  He threw so many facts and information at me, my head was spinning but I was happy to listen.  He knew the answer to every single one of my questions and he even mentioned that the Arizona Game and Fish Dept. consults him for building desert tortoise habitats.   Greg is on the road to recovery and will be completely well in 4-6 weeks.  He needed more sunlight and grass in his diet.  Thanks Avian!

This place is right next to my gym and so I'll stop by and check it out. I've asked myself why I keep coming back and the only conclusion I can come up with is that I'm a woman and I can shop the hell out of any place.   I'm going to start with the parking lot. There's like 3 rows of handicapped parking spots and each row has at least 5 designated handicapped spaces. So we're talking 15 parking spaces dedicated to handicapped parking. THEN they have an additional 4 spots reserved for associates. I do not understand the logic behind giving employees the choice spots. They are going to be there for 8 hours, I'm going to be there for 15 minutes... well 30 once you take into account all the walking I have to do in the parking lot.   Once I'm finally in I head straight for the shoes. The shoe department is hit or miss. After shoes I round the corner to housewares and browse through the sale items and the I finish in the unmentionables department which is ALWAYS way over priced.   If I do buy anything, guaranteed the line will be long and there will be a lot of eye rolling going on. The staff is meh. The store could benefit from being more organized.

It's more Liberty than Market.  I was just back from vacation and hoping to buy some ready made food for my empty fridge - my options were beer and cold salads.  So instead, I sat down and had a meal there.  I ordered a salad and my partner in crime had a grilled cheese sandwich, both were tasty.    Very cool minimalist decor but the tables and soda station were messy in the rush of the lunch hour.  The service was friendly - you go up to the counter, order your food and they bring it out to you, you grab your own drinks - it's not the type of place where you're being waited on.    The restrooms were unisex and then had an outer area where the boys and girls washed their hands together, I thought that was nice because you don't have to commit to going into a restroom just to wash your hands before your meal.  The sinks don't have a mirror in front of you, it's a window that looks outside - I liked that little detail.

Best spot in Gilbert for breakfast but you will have to wait a while.    This is a small charming little restaurant with really great staff.  The food is always fresh and delicious, they make really good breakfast potatoes.   Again, be prepared for the wait.

My family and I stayed here for the Mother's Day weekend and took part in their amazing brunch.  The spread for Mothers Day was fabulous.  The staff and grounds were five stars all the way.  The wide range of children's activities offered makes this one of the most kid friendly resorts I've stayed at in Phoenix.  The dining options are five star, Deseo is the best!  The only downside was lazy river scenery was disappointing.    We'll be back for sure!

I was looking for a cocktail dress and I remembered always passing by this store with wedding dresses in the window so I thought I'd check it out.  They have a great selection of gorgeous dresses and gowns.  My mom and I were there for about an hour, trying on dresses and deciding which one to buy.  Seriously, each dress was more beautiful than the last and I just wanted to buy all of them but I only need one.  I was so surprised that we both found things we loved in a store called "Group USA" at the Mills mall.    We were there for a total of 45 minutes before we ever saw a sales rep.  Which is fine by me, I don't like to be bothered when I'm shopping.  She was very nice when ringing us up.  The items were reasonably priced, I came in wayyyy under my budget of what I planned on spending for my dress.  My mom went nuts and bought a few cute tops and bottoms along with her dress, she was also under budget.      I knocked off a star because the dressing room area could use some cleaning and a fresh coat of paint.  Also, even though I didn't mind being haggled by the sales lady, a nice warm welcome into the store is always appreciated.

The barista that's there at 5:30 am is the best, she's always cheerful and reminds me to come back in a few hours for my .55 cent refill.  I try my damnedest to get back there but I get busy and forget.  She's really nice, I try to get in her line whenever possible.  There's another barista, that rolls their eyes at me when I order an "extra large" iced coffee and they go out of their way to tell me its a "trenta" or some bullshit like that.  Look, I know you like to give your sizes cute Italian names but I was born in the good ol U S of A and last time I check, you were born in Seattle, Starbucks.  So lets not act all hoity toity when someone places an order in English.

One of the really cool things about REI is that you can rent stuff.  Another cool thing is their selection of books, specifially on Arizona.  And one more cool thing is their staff, they're pretty knowledgable yet not all up in your face and following you around everywhere.  I would say that REI is one of the more expensive stores of it's kind.  But that's also because they have quality products.  When I find something I really want there I'll check out other stores to see if they have a better price and usually, they don't even carry the product I'm looking for, REI is unique that way.  I bought some gear here for my Grand Canyon backpacking trip - everything held up and I was well prepared.

I think this place is owned and operated by a husband and wife duo because they were arguing the entire time I was getting my pedicure and it was really uncomfortable.  It wasn't even an entertaining argument like Italians but embarrassing and everyone sitting in a chair was subjected to their bickering.  Aside from having to listen to that mess, the guy doing my pedicure when to put back on my flip flops and messed up the paint on my toe.  Instead of removing the polish and doing it over, he added more nail polish to fill this gash he had just made in the paint.  This was about 3 pm on a Saturday and when I went to sleep that evening, the paint on my toe was still not dry and I got polish on my bed sheets.                                                                                About a month later a coworker told me she was going to that place to get a mani/pedi before a date.  I urged her to steer clear and suggested another place I found near work but she had already made her appointment and didn't want to reschedule.  She also had a terrible experience, so much so that she went home and had to take the polish off her toes.  In the process, she ruined her manicure and took that off too.  $50 wasted.

Ted's offers a pretty good dog.  I'm not crazy about hot dogs but this person I know couldn't shut up about them so I had to fill the craving.  Ted's did the trick.  Very friendly, quick service, delicious dog, great toppings.

Very romantic date spot.  Watching the sunset after a monsoon storm is highly recommended.  Watching it on Top of the Rock with a nice bottle of red wine is like spanish fly.

There's another Buffalo Wild Wings on Ray and McQueen that is nicer than this one.  When you walk into this location, it has the same feel as an old Denny's.  My party and I stood by the "wait to be seated" sign for a few minutes.  Servers walked by and no one acknowledged us.  It was a Sunday night, busy but there were still plenty of empty tables.  One of the people I went there with said they had to use the restroom and asked if we'd order them a beer when we finally got a table.  When he came out of the restroom we were still standing there, unacknowledged.  With plenty of other options to dine nearby, we left.

Ta hell with CVS, I pick Walgrees every time - they don't make you carry around one of those ridiculous rewards cards.    Always very friendly staff and they have a good selection of $1 candies for the movies, so I hit up this place before I head to the theater.

It's pretty tasty Japanese fast food.  I've had their sushi a few times and the fish isn't top quality but you're not paying top dollar.  I think it's definitely worth a try if you're in the area.

This is my go to place for take-out Chinese on the West side.  The chow mein has tasty noodles but they are a little stingy with the shrimp.  I appreciate that they leave the sauce of the orange chicken on the side so it doesn't get all soggy on the way home.  The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable.

I hadn't been to this hospital since my cousin had a baby here almost 10 years ago.  At that time there was a lot of construction going on.  I am happy to say that the construction is over.    Pros: Amazing M.D.s and R.N.s clean modern free covered parking plenty of quiet places to grab a moment alone  Cons: There are a few people working in the CVICU that have terrible attitudes and are fantastic at treating people like shit.

I'm native to Phoenix and have been eating this brand of tortillas my entire life.  I guess my taste buds have adapted because no other tortilla brand compares.  Red Eagle brand laughs in the face of Mission Tortillas!  So when my father-in-law came to visit from the East Coast and asked for some authentic tortillas to take home I knew where to go.  You can buy a regular pack at grocery stores but the factory sells larger quantites which is what we wanted for him to take home.  We purchase several dozen tortillas and tamales and they were a hit back in Pennsylvania!  Thanks for not disappointing Red Eagle!

I found this place via my entertainment coupon book and remembered the Challenger accident when I was small.  The museum is a great monument to the amazing astronauts that died in the crash.  It really makes a difference if you get the tour, it adds so much more to the experience.   I really enjoyed myself here and would go back again.

I miss the days when flight attendants took pride in their appearance and were over the top nice.  The flight attendants for US Airways are run down and crabby.  There was an older Indian woman on my flight who did not speak English and they were very rude to her, it was hard to watch.    It really chaps my hide that luggage is now $25 so I've made adjustments in my packing to fit everything I need into two carry-ons.  At least they make you aware of the fee though, what I did not know is that they now charge for meals on flights across the country.  For $8 I got the nastiest sandwich they could throw together.  They also make you recycle, which is really cool but I wanted to throw away my plastic drink cup, put my tray up and pass out but I had to wait 20 minutes because they weren't collecting plastic at that time.  Here's a tip US Airways, when you treat your customers like crap, it puts them in a bad mood.  It's not a good idea to put people in a bad mood when they're cramped in  a small area, surrounded by strangers and can't get out of their seat for 5 hours.

I'm so grateful that we have this lovely museum because these are some of the exhibitions that have come through here and stayed with me:  Frida Kahlo Rembrandt Passport to Europe Ansel Adams Cezanne Defining Moments - Judy and Sidney Zuber  Really great spots inside here to steal some time to just sit and reflect.  By far, one of my favorite places in Phoenix.

On my quest to visit all the yelp high star places in my hood I stopped by LoLo's today.  I would have never known this place exsisted if it wasn't for yelp.  I had the Betty Boop which is 1 breast and 1 waffle.  The hubs had Sheedah's Special - a breast a wing and a waffle.   Since I've never had chicken AND waffles before I had no basis for comparison.  The chicken was a little on the dry side but I really liked the flavor.  The first bites of the waffle kinda reminded me of a frozen waffle but I quickly got past that with the cinnamon, buttery flavors. The iced tea was super good and I love that they serve them in Kerr jars so we didn't require any refills.  Oh!  I almost forgot the grits... because they're forgettable.  I've lived in the south and grits never grew on me.  It's been so long since I tried them and the reviews were stellar; I thought I'd give them a second chance.  I'm sorry grits but if that much butter and cheese can't make you taste good, nothing can.  The service was excellent.  Very quick.  Everyone was pleasant except for the hostess.  When we told the server it was our first time there she gave us a free piece of red velvet cake.  Very moist with a cream cheese frosting and walnuts on top.

The bar is separate from the restaurant.  I was in the bar and man, did it get rowdy.  The food was good.  Great selection of booze.  Friendly service.  The place could use some serious cleaning though.

After looking around for a smaller, centrally located venue to celebrate my grandmothers 75th birthday party we settled on this location because it was pretty and reasonably priced.  Even though my folks foot the bill, I helped my mom with all the preparations so I feel justified to review.  The establishment is older and has not had any renovations but the grounds are beautiful and the garden is well kept and complete with a gazebo and koi pond.  Inside has a large kitchen to prepare food or for caters to set up in.  We had 85 guests inside and still had enough room to set up a bar, DJ and dance floor, photo booth, candy bar and a step and repeat.   The woman who runs the place is named Linda and she was incredibly helpful and accommodating throughout the entire planning process.  She gave us the name of someone who did the linens and centerpieces for the lowest price we came across.  The entire event went off perfectly without a hitch and everyone had an amazing time.    There's only one caveat.  Linda does provide security as part of the package, there was a Phoenix Police Officer there during the entire event and he was very friendly to everyone as they entered the building.  When the party was over and we started cleaning up, I was taking stuff out to my truck and I heard Linda tell the officer that we had someone that was too intoxicated to drive home and he needed to speak to him.  The officer told her that this was a family event and he was confident that the family would handle the situation but Linda still insisted that he come inside to talk to him.  I already knew who she was referring to, it was one of my uncles who always drinks too much but he never gets out of control and his wife of 30 years who doesn't drink does the driving.  So she comes inside and points out one of the bartenders who is coincidentally wearing the same clothes as my uncle, they both have the same haircut and skin color.  When that didn't go as she expected, Linda pointed out one of my cousins and told the police officer she was too intoxicated to drive home.  One of my other uncles who doesn't drink was already set to drive her home, so the officer left.  I was disappointed by Linda's actions.  If she was so concerned with the safety of the only two people who over-drank at our party, she should have approached the host to inquire about their transportation before insisting that the police officer become involved.  Neither one of them were doing anything more than acting silly and telling everyone how much they loved them.  I could see how this same situation could go horribly awry with different personalities so I felt it worth mentioning.

This is a great place to volunteer and exercise some humanity.  A friend of mine asked me to tag along with him and I'm so glad I did, we've been back a couple of times to help out with the meals and drop off some things they were in need of at the time - like tampons.  If you want to get involved and help out, start here!

There's nothing I don't LOVE about Char's.  Oh wait, they have a tiny womans bathroom and when you stand up in one of the stalls everyone can see you head... weird but when you have a few drinks in you it doesn't bother you as much.    I love the regular bands, Lady J and Bad News Blues, really great.  The wait staff is always nice and quick to bring back the drinks.  It can be a bit of a sausage fest sometimes but I the guys have always been respectful and I've never hesitated coming here alone for that reason.   The dance floor is really small but again, once you get a few in you it doesn't matter.

I used to come here often when I was married and lived in the area, my husband and I loved to play pool here with friends.  I don't know if I was looking at life through rose colored glasses back then but the Hidden House seemed so much more pleasing than it does today.    I live in the east valley and my friend lives in the west valley so when he wanted to meet up to shoot some pool I recommended the Hidden House.  When I opened the door I thought "oh shit, this was a mistake."  The place just looks sad inside, like where people go when they need to cry in their beer or contemplate suicide.

Oh Lam's, you get me every time.  Being a desert girl, I'm a little apprehensive when it comes to buying "fresh seafood" but so far, Lam's has not disappointed.  I was taught how to cook by my grandmother whose mother was French creole and a lot of their recipes call for shellfish and fish.  This market has made the cooking experience that much more enjoyable by being able to select your meat instead of just grabbing the first bag from the frozen section.  Aside from the seafood their produce selection is also on point.

That's right, I'm giving this little greasy spoon 5 stars.  The food is everything you would require from a diner - tasty, hot, cheap.    I love the atmosphere!  Think Pulp Fiction - this place makes me feel like Vincent and Jules are in the booth behind me.  It adds a fun little element when you come in hungover/still drunk for breakfast.  The service is like you'd imagine it would be - a woman passes by every 3 minutes and calls you hun while she fills your coffee cup.

Man, I'm telling you, this Dillard's is a gold mine in the west valley!  It would be a day trip for me to drive to a decent mall to go shopping.  However this Dillard's has come through for me so many times.  When I need a quick outfit and don't have all day to shop I hit up this place.   I'm always amazed at how good the sale items are and there aren't that many people shopping here so the selection is great.  There is this one rack of jewelry by the escalator that is marked at 30%  - shit needs to go or be priced to sell at 70% off.    After Christmas I scored some nice decor at 80% off,  I look forward to going back next year.  I grab my Clinque products here and the makeup counter ladies are a pain in the ass but still, I appreciate the convenience.

My car was in a shop nearby and I looked for the closest bar to wait it out.  I did meet some really friendly company in this place and ended up having a good time.    First impression: the place is really really dirty.  I didn't want to drink out of my glass.  The bartender was MIA for the first 5 minutes and wasn't to quick to give me a refill either.    I came here because the other person that reviewed this place said it was a great sports bar.  I think The Sixth Sense was on the small TV and the food... well, if I didn't feel comfortable drinking out of my pint glass, I sure as hell wouldn't eat there.

This review is for the nightlife, not the food.   Myself and two other Latinas came here on a Friday night. There was an AWESOME band playing everything from oldies to cumbias. Even though it was ridiculously packed we were always able to find a place to rest our feet while we waited out the slow songs. Man, I haven't heard a live band play cumbias this well in a while. I seriously danced all night long.   The bar was packed and it made it hard to get a drink, I wish they would have had servers.   The crowd was puro Latinos. No one bothered us, no one even asked us to dance, which pissed off one of my friends but I didn't care, that's what I love about cumbias, you can dance by yourself.   I can't wait to come back!

No cover, live band... need I say more?  Yes, it's country music but I'm a little bit country.  What's great about this place is the dancing.  I two step, waltz, west coast and east coast swing and so do the cowboys that frequent this place.  My friends and I barely had a chance to sip our drinks, we were always on the dance floor.  I've only been here twice and we danced our asses off both times.    Also, they have an enclosed smoking patio with a bar.  There seems to be an entirely different crowd out there but still a lot of fun.  The drinks are meh, I had a rum & coke that tasted like cough syrup so I just stuck to beer and shots.  Cocktail waitresses were very attentive.

When I left this place the bartender threw her fist up in the air and told me to go take on the world. How cool is that?  I was impressed by how clean it was inside.  Plus they have craft beer on tap for $3.  Need I say more?

Tortilla chips for breakfast?  Not just any tortilla chips, flour tortilla chips, fried and doused in cinnamon and sugar.  Arrive early though because once they run out, that's it.    This is a great establishment and I love coming here for breakfast.  We've had my mom and brother's birthday breakfasts here so I can also attest to their ability to serve large parties.  There's a large variety of meals to choose from on the menu and if you're a "breakfast is your favorite meal" type person (like me) then it could take you a minute to decide.  Mexican breakfast and traditional American breakfast items combine to make a tasty menu.  I've had everything and its all delicious "no frills" food; they make it like it's described.  On an occasion, the breakfast potatoes were undercooked.  Also, when grandma is joining us she gets the whole wheat pancakes and according to her they are "raw inside" but she still continues to order them so... I don't know.  I always like to mention the restrooms in my reviews because I think it is a HUGE factor in a restaurant where I am a patron.  As many times as I have been here I've never used their facilities.  If you park behind the restaurant and come in through the rear entrance you will pass the restrooms and there is always an odor as if the toilets aren't working properly.  Luckily, they are far removed from the rest of the restaurant.  Despite that, I still give this place all my stars because it has delicious food; I have never had a bad experience especially because of the awesome servers.   The servers, who seem to always be female, remind me of a time when they were called waitresses and they knew how everyone took their coffee and could juggle five plates while topping off your cup.

I was drawn to this place because of the photos they have on their windows of their bagel sandwiches.  I finally found the time to stop by for breakfast and wasn't disappointed.  The lady working the counter was super sweet and patient with me while I debated a nova lox or egg, ham and cheese... the latter won.  I wasn't disappointed.  The sandwich was moist and delish... a lot better than Einstiens.

Is there a a better sport than night golf?  Me thinks not!  Kokopelli puts on some awesome night golf parties!  I've read the reviews of people complaining about the course and the grass not being green enough but if you come at night, it won't bother you nearly as much.  The staff is kind and helpful.  I recommend everyone check this out for some fun out of the sun.

I get my dresses and coats cleaned here and they always do a good job.  If I forget to print out coupons before I go, the really cool girl at the counter will spot me one.  Once, I needed a dress cleaned for a special occasion at the last minute and they totally accommodated me.

Amazing beer selection... the mind reels!  This bar is really well hidden, I've been in this shopping center quite a few times and never knew it was there.  I didn't know what to expect walking in, some brewery's can be snobby but this one totally wasn't.  It's small but it has large tables so you can bring friends and stay awhile.  They also provide games which is always a bonus when drinking with friends.   They have this amazing wall with coolers filled with every kind of imaginable beer.  I wanted to be like Augustus Gloop in Willy Wonka and just go crazy cracking them all open and trying each one... but I controlled myself.  The hubs and I sat at the bar where they also have a great selection of beers on tap.  We were not disappointed by our selections and we were able to try a few without getting an annoying look from the bartenders.    The food was good.  We had the margarita pizza which was so yummy.  Great crust, my husband is a crust freak and it did not disappoint.  Good service; helpful bartenders, quick with the refills.  I will be back fo sho!  I've gotta try the orange blossom!

Amazing selection of deli meats!  The prosciutto sandwich is my fave, I haven't tried anything else but I just love prosciutto.  I've recently started buying the grocery store products to incorporate into my Italian cooking and my recipes have never tasted better.  I feel like a master chef now.  I will never again use Prego, I'm embarrassed to even admit that I ever used it!

There's a reason I avoided this venue for so long- because I didn't want to be pushed up against a bunch of sweaty people. But the right occasion and the right band pulled me from my comfort zone and into the Marquee Theatre. I'm not going to bitch about the parking, $5 isn't bad for an event and the lot was across the street. Once we got there they separated us into boy/girl lines. Since it was an anniversary gift for my husband, I had the cash to pay and had to jump out of line to give it to him. I tried going to the front of the line to see how we purchased tickets and they directed me back to the line. After I get searched, have by bag gone through, put my boots back on, get my drivers license scanned, get a wrist band, they finally ask for a ticket. Somewhere during that huge process you think they would have let you purchase a ticket. From the line we were standing in there was no way to see the ticket booths, never mind I had already asked some idiot working there. We finally get in and the drinks were stiff and reasonably priced. The theatre had very poor ventilation and airflow, it was like being inside a sauna. The stage is a decent size and the ground slopes down (as most theatres do) for better viewing. The sound however was not so great. I did like that they had little bars set up inside the theatre, it made the lines shorter. There's a patio with a few benches and that's all the seating in the entire place.   The Marquee was all I expected it to be except for the sound. You'd think a music venue would care more about acoustics.  Oh, from the patio you can see all the people getting pulled over by Tempe police, watching someone get a DUI always puts a nice damper on your night.

I chose to start rock climbing at this gym because its close to work.  The first timers training was very informative, I received all the info I hoped I would and even made some friends along the way.  This gym is awesome.  The rentals fees are low, the gear is in good shape and the staff is super friendly and eager to help out without making you feel like a dummy for asking.    One thing I find terribly funny is that you can get a lifetime membership for only a million dollars, I can't decide if this is a joke or a typo but it makes me laugh all of the time.

For so long I've looked for a place that delivers soup and Dilly's Deli Delivers!  The soups are creamy and delicious, I can't get enough, I've had them all.  Plus they have bread bowls which is the best soup companion.  The sandwiches are also really good, I've only had the Dilly Bird but it beats any of the other sandwich places in the area.

A few years ago I had a coworker that loved to eat here so we'd come by often but I left that job and I hadn't been back until recently.   When I used to come regularly, I'd always get the Arroz con Pollo and it was so perfect.  The chicken was slow cooked so the meat was tender with so much flavor, the cooked vegetables and rice that accompanied were also delicious on their own without the chicken, it was a perfect meal.   I was excited to come back and I naturally ordered the same thing.  When it arrived I was so disappointed.   The juicy well prepared chicken had been replaced with long skinny strips of precooked chicken, it wasn't even edible.  The medley of vegetables had been replaced with just cabbage and the rice was the only edible item so that's what I ate.  We had ordered some guacamole to share and out came this mint green pudding.  It tasted like a tub of sour cream with a small amount of avocado put into the blender.  The margaritas were good though.

The burgers remind me of Micnics, remember Micnics?  This is what I don't like about the place: 1)  standing in a long ass line and having someone yell at me to yell my order back at them 2) the buffet of fixings that allows you, flies and everyone else and their filthy fingers to make their own burger 3) its dirty 4) I smell like a grease ball when I leave   I want to kick back and relax when I eat a meal, this place is too much work for too little pay off.

I went here to get a spray tan for my company holiday party.  I have a medium skin tone but my summer tan was totally gone and I didn't want look be pasty in my cocktail dress.  I had done this totally wack spray tan from a tanning salon years ago and it ended up being a nightmare.  This time I couldn't mess around and knew I had to get it done by a professional.  I was not disappointed.    This is a really nice salon.... trendy and clean inside.  As I waited for my tan I was bummed that I wasn't getting my hair done as well.  Everyone sitting in a chair had cool color and cuts going on; I couldn't help but be jealous.  My appointment was with Danielle.  She gave me run down on what to expect as far as the tan and how to care for my skin to achieve maximum results.  She mentioned that she had been doing this for 7 years, and I could tell, she was really professional and knowledgeable.    The tan came out great.  No streaking at all, Danielle did an amazing job.  I didn't look like an umpa lumpa either, it was all very natural and I got a lot of compliments.  It's been 5 days and it still looks great.

Hell yeah!  I was on my way to buy something that costs $100 and I thought I'd stop by here and see if they had one - they did and I got it for $12.  It was in excellent condition, the stickers were still on it, I don't think it had ever been used.  Cha Ching!

I'm pretty sure this is the only gas station that I've ever eaten from. This place sells Boars Head and makes delicious sandwiches with Boars Head products.  They also sell a selection of craft beer, it's a small selection but in this neck of the woods, it's hard to find anything of higher quality than Heineken. The gas is usually priced cheaper, it's Sinclair. Those few facts allow me look over the less forgivable qualities. Like the ladies that work her are pretty ornery.  I first discovered this place in 2004 when my dad told me about their delicious potato salad they serve with their sandwiches.  From that day to this, the same lady has made the sandwiches.  I've never seen her crack a smile and she seems reluctant to write down your order but still, she makes some damn good sandwiches.  They have a ton of freshly baked goodies and a deli cooler packed with ready to go meals.

The pan dulce here is so delish.  Seriously, the cochitos here are the best I've ever had, so sweet and moist.  I love the fact that everything is made fresh daily.  I've always received great service and the store looks immaculate even though it's dated.  The store is always packed so be prepared to wait a little and the register is cash only.

Everything here is delicious, the Greek salad, gyros, baklava chicken shawirma, it's all good!  One of the times we ate here we sat next to two guys who were enjoying their food so much, they called another friend down to eat with them.  Yup it's that good.   It's located in a shady looking strip mall and the inside isn't much to talk about but the food is totally worth it.

Glendale Flowers did the floral arrangements for my dads memorial service, they did an outstanding job.  I saved a ton of money by ordering them over the phone and then picking them up instead of ordering them online and having them delivered.  Before I picked up the flowers, I regreted not buying corsages and boutianeers for my loved ones.  When my friend and I showed up to pick up the flowers, they had some in the fridge and gave me a great deal on them because they were supposed to be for a wedding the following weekend and they made them by mistake.  Score!  Thanks Glendale Flowers.

These hot dogs were gooood and I don't particularly care for hot dogs.  I had a chubby: mustard, grilled onions, peppers and fries. Damn it was good. I couldn't finish it though.  We split some onion rings and they were too greasy.  The dipping sauce for the onion rings was rare like all-the-condiments-in-the-fridge-mixed-together kind of rare.   Don't get a chubby in the car.  Don't take your chubby home. Get a chubby there and eat it there.

My dad has been bringing me to Pedro's since I was a little girl.  I always get the same thing, chicken chimichanga - it's ooohh so good.  It's not those big chunks of precooked shamrock chicken that you get at a lot of Mexican food places, it's real chicken and it's been cooked with love, you can tell.  Chips and salsa are both hot and fresh, always.  The place is small and sometimes you have to wait for a table but it's always worth the wait.  The ladies bathroom is gross, just hold it until you get somewhere safe.

Some of my friends gathered together and came to visit me during my lil stay on the westside.  Where did we go?  Max's.  All. night. long.  over and over again.    We had a ton of fun at this place.  It's quirky as fuck.  There are football helmets in glass cases that line the hallways.  Murals of screaming sport fans along the walls.  Ol codgers belly up to the bar and yell at the horses on the screen "that's it baby, right there, keep it going."  So entertaining!  The beers where ridiculously cheap.  One of the times we went, we were there all day and all night and the tab was like $12.      I haven't tried the food there.

My usual Chinese spot was closed so we ventured here.  The service was super friendly and based on that alone, I'd totally come back but the food had a funky taste to it.  I thought it was just one dish but no, it was everything.

The pancakes, waffles and muffins are all good delicious but the pancakes are some of the best - you know crisp buttery ends and all fluffy inside.  The sausage and bacon are also delicious and so are the home fries.   You can't go wrong with this place for breakfast if you're on the westside but it's also popular so be prepared to wait.

The exterior of Parsons Family Restaurant has kept me at bay for years.  Recently though, I've noticed Glendale PD eating there and I think cops and firefighters are always aware of the best hole-in-the-wall restaurants in their hood.  So I decided to give it a try and I'm glad that I did.  Breakfast is my favorite meal and I usually cook it myself unless I'm running around.   Parsons offers no frills basic breakfast for reasonable prices.  The service is lightning fast.  Really low key, you can roll just of bed and come in here on a lazy Saturday.

I really enjoy stopping by for some fresh produce.  Their selection isn't as big as a typical farmers market but their produce is consistently delicious.    I came by for their fall fear for the second time and we had a nice time on both occasions.  The pumpkins are pricey so I only got one. A really big one.

This assisted living facility is above average.  It's a combination of nursing home and rehab facility.  The staff is hit or miss depending on which nurses are working. This place could have been cleaner but it didn't smell like urine, mainly just clutter. I didn't think it was sanitary that they used the same water to mop every person's room but, that's really the biggest complaint I have.   The rehab was effective and consistent.  They also had a really nice outdoor courtyard where we spent most of our time. Inside there are some shops that include a beauty parlor and ice cream shop...it's all made to look like a little village of shops. They also provide several activities throughout the day.

Oh baby, this is my favorite lake in the entire state.  It's positively gorgeous here.  I spent my summers as a kid at Apache and to me, it's better than any staycation at any of the resorts in town.  Skiing, wake boarding, tubing - so much more fun than any lazy river!  Jet skiing all day and waking up with every body part totally sore and sunburned, frizzy hair, a tad bit of a hangover and grabbing a cold beer with breakfast, ready to do it all over again - that to me is the perfect idea of summer.    I've been here twice already this summer and I plan on spending every weekend I can here.  Typically, I'm a camping girl and love to camp.  However, I grew up on this lake with all the comforts of having a trailer until they tore them down in 2002.  So, I am accustomed to certain amenities (like A/C) when I come to the lake and I stay at the hotel instead.  The hotel is acceptable.  Ten steps up from camping.  We spend all day out on the lake, come inside for a nice cold shower, throw on a sundress and head to the bar for some drinks, meet up with old friends, laugh, dance, make out.  SO.MUCH.FUN!  **Pros  Camping RV hookups hotel restaurant that cooks the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had in my life bar store wet slips for $12 a day gorgeous scenery that makes you happy when you look at it party cove boat storage incredibly, incredibly friendly people working here It's too far away for all of the douchebags in their daddy's boats to come visit  **Cons haven't you been paying attention?  There are none!

I had an excellent margherita pizza here.  I knew this place was a hit and busy all the time but luckily I happened to be in the area when it was slow and checked it out for the first time.  The seating is a little uncomfortable but the pizza was great and so were the servers.   I thought I saw on the Yelp app that they don't do take outs but I saw people leaving with pies so I'm going to give it a try.

I've been to quite a few Diamondback games and events here over the years but the last game was by far the best ever.   The last week of April and the weather dropped down to the 60's, it felt like San Francisco or Seattle even the air smelled different, it was the most beautiful day I had seen all year.  The roof to the stadium was open with large clouds passing over throughout the game.  We sat in the "All You Can Eat Seats" and it offered free hot dogs, chips, popcorn, sodas & waters.  This was my first time on the second level and I liked it a lot more because on the first level, I'm always paranoid about getting hit in the face with a line drive when I'm not paying attention.   About the time of the 8th inning a huge gust of wind came and the sky darkened, it started to rain so they shut the roof but a lot of people had already ran out of the stadium.  Plus, the Dbacks were playing terrible so people had left due to that as well.  Since the stadium was dead so we walked around and went exploring and it's a really nice place with endless amenities.  You can have a great time here without even knowing there's a game going on.

I know this is blasphemy in my hood but I didn't like Barrio Cafe.  My husband and I had been trying to make it in there for a while now but everytime we go there it's packed so we opt for something less crowded.  We finally popped in during lunch; it's pretty cozy inside.  The server was rude, anything we said he acted like he had no idea what we were talking about and never cracked a smile.  I had the pollo poblano- the sauce was lacking in flavor, chicken was dry.  For the price I was expecting something better.  I didn't even like the margarita and I've never met a drink I didn't like.  Maybe the Chingona was out?

Oh my oh my, what a restaurant.  I did some researching before deciding on where I wanted to eat my birthday dinner and I finally settled on SW because I read a magazine article that said they were the only restaurant in the US that had the license to serve real Kobe beef from Japan.  We made reservations to sit on the patio and even though they couldn't guarantee a seat on the patio, we got one anyway.  The weather outside was perfect, our server was attentive, knowledgeable and very friendly.  For an appetizer we shared the seafood platter but we also received an assortment of breads and it seemed like every bite we took was more delicious than the last.  Then my steak arrived and it was phenomenal, I savored each succulent bite.  At some point a huge frog emerged from the waterfall and lip synced Louis Armstrong's Wonderful Life.  We stopped to enjoy the moment and take in the words of the song, it made me grateful for my surroundings.  This was one of the best dining experiences I've had in my life and it was due to the delicious food, our amazing server and a giant frog of all things.

The first time I stayed here was in 2004 - about two years after it opened so everything was still new.  I've stayed here one weekend each summer since then.  It's hard to believe that it's been 8 years since my first visit but what can I say, I LOVE this resort.    The valet, front desk and the bellhops were the nicest, respectful and most helpful people.  I can't say enough good things about them, so very friendly!  My last visit was for three days over Labor Day weekend and I was happy to see that everything inside of the resort is still in impeccable shape.  The pool area however was not as shiny as usual.  The umbrellas needed some repairs and the chairs were all sun bleached.  Another thing I didn't like was the inconsistency in the "pool rules."  In previous stays, you weren't allowed to take the inner tubes out of the lazy river but this weekend, everyone was hording their tubes by their chairs, not only making it difficult to walk around but also forcing many people inside the lazy river to walk instead of float, it looked like a zombie walk.  Also, I like to bring a cooler bag with snacks and drinks because I'm literally at the pool from sun up to sun down and I won't pay $12 for a drink every time someone gets thirsty - everyone got ONE $12 drink a day, that it!  I've never had a problem with  bringing a cooler bag before but this year, some of the staff would allow it and others would not.  I really like the packages that the resort offers, I was able to save a lot on Wi-Fi and resort fees just by going with a package - plus I got a $100 resort credit which was amazing.  I definitely recommend going with a package.  Also, if you're going to stay longer than one night, I recommend bringing a cooler - you can save a lot on drinks and snacks.  The resort offers a nice little market where you can pick up snacks but you're going to pay three times more than you would at a grocery store.  You can use ice from their ice machine to replenish the ice in your cooler.  It's easy to rack up a large bill at this resort, cutting corners helps.

Oh now I remember why this place is so popular, it's gorgeous and conveniently located.  I woke up about 4:00 am on a Sunday morning, a storm came about the same time and dumped bucket sized rain drops onto my house, it lasted for about 45 minutes.  Once it was gone I realized why I loved Arizona storms so much and that's because they are gone as quickly as they come.  I was going to go out to the White Tanks for a hike but I realized that all of the transplants who love Camelback would stay in bed due to the rain so I jumped in the car and drove over - sure enough, parking spots!  I did the Echo Canyon trail which isn't long but it is tough on the knees.  I'm going to say this hike has the best views of the city and it's obvious why it's always covered with people.  I wish it was less busy, I loved reminiscing about my mom bringing my brother and I on hikes here as kids.

Another satisfied customer!  The food is so freaking delicious and fresh.  Cibo is in a beautiful old home that makes it feel intimate and romantic - there's really not a bad seat in the house.  Service is consistently good.    Things you should know: they close from 2-5 on weekdays; they don't serve pizza for lunch and if I'm not mistaken, I believe they make fresh pasta on Tuesday's and Wednesday's.    My favorite wines: Chianti, Neprica, Aglianico   My favorite menu items: Burrata, margherita pizza

My weekly sushi hot spot was jam packed on Friday at lunch, 30 minute wait...me thinks not.  I hopped on my iphone and searched for the next closest sushi place.  As I scrolled down the list I came across Sushi Eye - a new location!  The restaurant is in a strip mall and the suite next to it is under construction and it made for a noisy lunch.  The d√©cor in Sushi Eye was pretty cool, Asian themes with lime green and brown accents.  I'm a sucker for menus that have photos of their dishes... usually found in places like Denny's.  I was surprised that Sushi Eye has photos of their rolls.  The photos looked like a beautiful, colorful collage... it made me want everything on the menu.  My friend and I ordered Nigiri hamachi, salmon and tuna.  The salmon was so good, they made my eyes roll back into my head... we had two more servings.  The rolls we ordered were "Second Climax", "Las Vegas" and "Booty Booty".  These were the most unique rolls I had ever tasted; they hit every taste bud on my tongue.  I was delighted to have some Roe floating around in my mouth after my meal to remind me of the amazing lunch.  The only downside to the meal was the restaurant was freezing cold... I hope it's this cold in the summer time because I'm going back for sure!

There's nothing bad I can say about this comfy dinning establishment.  Oh, wait.  Some of the tables are faced awkwardly towards each other so that you're forced to stare at the people in front of you and they are forced to stare right back... uncomfortable.    I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait for lunch.  We arrived at 12:00 on a Saturday and we were sat immediately.  SCORE!  The food: my girlfriend and I started with the sashimi salad. I was a little nervous about the "spicy ginger" in the description but it complimented the tuna perfectly and ended up being a very refreshing starter.  We both had burgers and they were so juicy and HUGE!  Neither one of us could finish our burgers and were happy to box them up for leftovers.

Seriously, what the fuck are you people waiting in those long ass lines for?  Did I miss something?  Are they giving handies in the restroom... wait... do they even have a restroom?  It's so small, it's impossible to not have people in your personal bubble and who wants strangers breathing on them when they're trying to eat?  The servers are these bitchy girls that argue with each other and one looked so dirty I wanted to squirt her with my hand sanitizer each time she passed by me.    The food - it's a normal breakfast.  Nothing about the meal made me think I was having something special.  Yes, the bacon was good but really, have you ever had bad bacon?  They don't have fountain drinks, just canned RC so I stuck to coffee.

Nothing like a warm chalice right out of the dishwasher to hold my Stella.  I can't stand this bar because of the consistently shitty bartenders.  Yet, it's location is prime to meet up with people and it has it's own parking lot which is also convenient.  It's got a nice little vibe going on inside but again, I've never anything but terrible service.

This is the best library in the Valley and one of my favorite places to study.  The interior design, water fall, glass elevators and many other features make this the perfect metropolitan library for our downtown.   The top level is pretty quiet and has beautiful views of the city.  Quick Tip: It seems that the southern part of the building is hotter because of the sun so I always sit on the north part of the building.

What's not to love about this place?  The veggies are so crisp and delicious, they make me want to find the source and buy some for home.  I'm not going to pretend to be an expert in the cuisine but everything I've tried here is absolutely delicious and I can't pronounce any of it.   The outside of the restaurant is adorable and kind of romantic and the inside is unassuming and seemingly clean.  I think it's very reasonably priced for such fresh and flavorful food.

I come for the books!    Last time I was here there was a large display of The Secret books.  It made me wonder if all the people that sold these books to Bookmans had ever discovered the Secret.  I love walking up and down the isles of Bookmans while pondering shit like that about the books previous owner.  I try not to get too junked out about the fact that their germs are all over a book I'm about to purchase - I mean, you have to live a little.  The only downside is that you're not guaranteed the book you want, I came in with a list of 3 books I wanted to read and none of them were there.

Whoever thought that sweet corn tamales and tilapia would go well together?  This is my favorite dish at Ticoz.  I get a craving for this unique dish and drop by every couple months.  The food here is consistently good; the service, meh, not so much.  But I don't let that deter me from coming back because the food is that delicious.  As for cocktails, I usually get the margarita but once I tried the sangria and it was gross, it tasted like flowers, weird I know.

Whoa!  What happen to Ticoz? This place use to be awesome.    As I waited for an eternity to get a drink I looked around the place and it looked like it was in desperate need of some TLC - furniture and carpets need to be cleaned, walls need to be repainted.  The plants were all dead in the women's restroom.  This place is dying a slow death.  What used to be a happening place for happy hour was dead, it was sad hour.    The service was terrible!  We were sitting in an empty bar and it still took a while to get a drink.  My friends and I were going to order apps but they never came back to ask us if we wanted food, thank god too because we would have had to stay there longer.  We chugged our drinks and bounced out.

I've been a loyal ikea fan for years so it pains me to write them a bad review.  I recently remodeled my new home and came to ikea for flooring and kitchen cabinets.  I went in to purchase the flooring first but apparently their flooring is being eliminated. They did have one pallet left of the flooring I wanted but I couldn't find it so I asked for help.  I was unimpressed by their searching methods.  Looking in the same place that I already looked and confirming it's not there isn't helpful.  About the same time I went to purchase my cabinets, ikea comes out with a new commercial that's aimed at clueless people who want a new kitchen, so I went in to buy my cabinets with confidence and measurements in hand.  I walked to the kitchen department and waited for an employee to finish up on the computer. I told him I was there to buy cabinets and he asked me if I knew which ones I wanted, I said I didn't so he hands me a booklet and tells me to pick them out and he'll put the order in for me.  I said "don't you guys do this for me" and he said "you have to pick out the cabinets."  Great.  I left and grabbed a glass of that lingadong juice from the restaurant and started figuring out measurements and hurting my head with thoughts of angles and door openings.  When I finished, I headed back to the department to give the guy my list and I saw a couple sitting at the computer with a different Ikea employee and they were living the commercial!  My heart sank.  Why were those jerks getting their entire kitchen designed on cool software and I had to pick mine out of some black and white catalog- 1950's style.  My money is just as green as theirs!  As the guy started entering my order and asking me questions about toe kicks and countertops, my blood started to boil and I let the guy have it for not giving me the same service as the other customers there.  His attitude quickly changed and he became helpful.  At first he had told me to grab the sink drains and cabinet handles on my way out but after our chat, he went and got them for me.  When I went to pay for my order they told me it had to be picked up the same day, not ideal but okay.  I called my contractor and he said he'd be there in a few hours.  I'm pretty sure I'm the first customer to ever buy cabinets but have someone else pick them up because they have no system in place for that.  I had to beg the guy at the counter to help me out but he wouldn't.  So I decide to return the next day when Harry and I can go together.  We come back the next day, I hand the cashier my order to pay and she tells me that they are out of everything.   Me: really? You're out of every single cabinet that's on my order?  IKEA cashier: yes, really.  Me: In one day you sold out of all these cabinets?That doesn't make sense, these cabinets are on 3 different displays upstairs. This sink has been sold here for years. How can you be out?  IKEA cashier: I don't know, but we're out.  Go talk to "pick-up" about ordering more.  Me: pick up? Really? Okay   The pick up guy tells me to talk to "returns" and returns tells me that because the order was placed yesterday, it's coming up as not available. He fixes it and finally I'm able to purchase the kitchen but not before growing contempt for my favorite home store.  Lastly, I get a call from my frustrated contractor because the directions are telling him to drill holes into the cabinet face but there are no marks where to make the holes. I tell him no way, ikea instructions are faultless.  After a 25 minute hold with Ikea support, I find out that guy at the kitchen department was supposed to give me templates for the holes to be made in the cabinets.  Thanks for failing me once again, careless dude.

This stadium is awesome.  I've come here for events, concerts, graduations but my favorite thing to do here is watch my Cardinals kick some ass!  The they have restrooms all over the place and each of those restrooms have a ton of stalls, I've never had to wait in line which is important when watching a live event.  My buddy and I went to the last home game of the season here and we decided to hang out after the game was over and let the madness outside die down so we'd be able to find our uber driver.  I was surprised how long they let you stay and drink for.. perhaps it was because we were at the club level but the bar stayed open for like an hour after the game and they served us 4 cocktails at last call so we could stay and hang out with all the other stragglers.  We had an AMAZING time, so much fun!

Aside from the Macy's on 34th street in NY, this one is my favorite store.  They carry all my favorite designers, especially for work clothes.  Not to mention, the shoe department always the hottest selection of pumps.  There's a tiny Ukrainian woman that works in the shoe department, I love her, she is SO patient with me and gives me her two cents as she keeps bringing out the shoes.    I wanna meet the buyer for this store and become her/his bestie.  They also have a personal shopper near the women's dressing rooms.  Not that I'd ever have the need for one but you might.  The sales people are always really nice and helpful.  On a side note: I once met this old guy who said he brought Janis Joplin to this store to buy panties when she did a show here.  I've always doubted that story but it never fails that when I go to the lingerie department I tell myself "I'm standing where the late great Janis stood."  She's one of my all times.

I love starting my day saying "morning" to a bunch of strangers while we're all hiking around Squaw Peak.  I've spent a lot of time here and it's a beautiful area.  The hike to the summit is moderate; I believe it's barely a mile.  Squaw Peak offers many different trails to choose from my favorite is the Perl Charles.  There is also a cement walking path that can be used for people that can't tolerate the rocky terrain.  I think it's cool that one of the trails goes underneath the 51 even though I always hesitate walking through the tunnel...I've watched too many movies.    Another one of my favorite things about Squaw Peak is Tammy.  She has boot camp here EVERY weekday at 5:00 AM.  I went to her camp everyday for 5 months (before I moved) and it was life changing.  Not only does Tammy push you beyond what you knew you could do physically, she also gives emotional support that helps you preserver through the hard work.  http://phxbootcamp.com/site/index.php

Croissant my love, how I adore you.  Croissants are my favorite breakfast staple.  I've had them everywhere but none as great as the ones at Essence.  I live for these, I dream about them, and since I discovered Essence I have to have them on a weekly basis.  From what I've heard, the chef (God bless her) has this special fatty butter shipped from France to make these criossants.  I don't know if that's true or some story my mind has concocted to find reasons to buy more.  Either way, I'm hooked.  The perfectly crisp crust on the outside an the airy inside make it the superb balace of yin and yang that all other croissanteers have failed to grasp.

Is it possible for anyone to NOT like this place? It's kinda like Disneyland for an outdoorsman... or in my case and outdoorswoman. Um, the gun room was like a wet dream. There's also a really nice discount section upstairs where I got some things I didn't know I needed. Actually, this place is full of stuff I didn't know I needed. I bought some hiking boots and the shoe department offers a little rough terrain ramp type thing you can try out shoes on, it's kind of a joke because it's so small but I tried it out anyway. They also have the largest selection of outdoor clothing for women that I've come across in the valley. I think special outdoor clothing is ridiculous because brands like Patagonia, Columbia and North Face are so over priced and you're going to be wearing them to get dirty anyway, why would you waste the money. That being said, I still love to browse through and see if there's anything I can't live without.

I'm so happy I stumbled upon this gem!  I had driven by a few times on my way home and decided to stop in for a drink.  The bar is small and full of life.  The same regulars have been warming the stools for years and they have the crazy dynamic going on that's so entertaining.  As soon as I sat down the bartender introduced me to everyone and they treated me like one of the gang from there on.    To eat I've had the filet mignon and burger - both were full of flavor and cooked perfectly to my specifications.  Everyone you encounter at this place is so warm and friendly, you want to keep coming back!

I'm one of those crazy people that need to visit multiple stores to complete my grocery shopping. This Sprouts has the best selection of produce for the best price. The organic section isn't bad either. I also like the quality of meat/poultry, so fresh and reasonably priced.  When I walk in I try to remember to go straight for the produce otherwise I'll get sidetracked by the "all natural" lotions, oils and body washes. Then on to the vitamins and supplements, I can spend forever reading labels and trying to find something I can't live without. Inevitably my head starts to spin and I move on but it's always an elucidating part of my visit.  To top it off the staff is really friendly. It's always an enjoyable shopping experience at Sprouts... for my wallet too!

I had the BEST time here!  To eat I had the sirloin and a baked potato.  I only had room for the steak so I bagged up the potato and all the fixings and gnawed on it the next morning when I woke up hungover.  The potato was the best I've ever had in my life but that may have something to do with the condition I was in because it was cold and from the night before.  The steak.... I was a little disappointed, I want a $40 steak to knock my socks off but it tasted like something I could have made on my grill.  The service was amazing, really, I walked in with a six pack of Stella and they put them in the fridge for me.

Staycations on the Labor Day weekend have been a tradition in my family for the past 6 years.  The most recent stay was selected by an 8 year old and based off the photos of the swimming pools in comparison to the other resorts in the Valley - Pointe Hilton at Squaw Peak won.    I am told that this resort is one of the cheaper ones in the Valley and more family oriented.  So I kept that in mind as I walked around the unimpressive grounds to get to my hotel room.   It's obvious to see the similarities between the Pointe Squaw Peak and the Arizona Grand which was originally the Pointe South Mountain.  I think that location has been kept up better than Squaw Peak.  There's nothing worth mentioning about the hotel room except that the bathroom was small and dated.   The reason for the trip revolved around the pools though.  The River Ranch has a lazy river that's incredibly narrow.  In some areas two inner tubes could not pass side by side, it hard to keep from playing footsies with strangers.  Since I was there on a holiday weekend the pool staff asked hotel guests to exit the lazy river once they reached the entrance again.  Laziness was kept to a minimum.  The swimming pools at the River Ranch were long and narrow.  One pool had a water fall but it looked cloudy as fug, I didn't go in there once.  The other pool at the River Ranch has a basket ball hoop and volleyball net.  There are two other pools outside of the River Ranch, both have bars but there are no swim up bars on the property, I checked.  My mom knows that I Yelp and she wanted me to mention that Justin, a server at the pool was rude to her and that there are no cabanas for rent.    Another reason for the low stars would be the culture that the hotel offers.  The lack of trust between the hotel and guest is so off putting that it became an annoyance.  There's a large presence of security on the grounds and they stand post in different areas.  In order to get a towel at the pool, guests have to fill out their name, room number, signature and number of towels and then be assigned a number to be written on your wrist band.  If you do not bring back your towels, you will be charged $25 per towel.  So at the end of the day, I had to carry 8 wet towels all the way to the entrance of the waterpark and wait in line to return it, so much for the resort life.  If you want to play with a ball, you have to deposit your ID.  If you want to run a tab, you need a credit card.  I wouldn't get served without an ID.  Who brings their wallet down to the hotel pool?  During my stay, I met one person who lost their ID and two people who lost their credit cards at the pool.  I blame the hotel, how is someone supposed to keep their ID and credit cards secure while swimming?  Then the more days I stayed there, it became obvious that the hotel needs these rules in effect because the quality of guests it attracts require a lot of rules to keep them in line.  It was like a prison, gaurds vs inmates.  Adults that don't know how to behave in public (screaming at and bullying kids, behaving drunk, wearing jean shorts at swimsuits) seem to frequent this resort hence the heavy security and signs that need to remind people to not put chairs in the pool. The Pointe Squaw Peak has to be the saddest property in the Hilton's range of resorts.  The only way I'd ever come back is if Hilton did a total renovation and got rid of the dated apartment complex look.  It's a beautiful location but an ugly resort.

I was surprised to find more hiking gear here than REI or Cabelas. I bought a 4L bladder here which is the largest I've come across in ANY other sporting goods store. There's a couple of other cool items I've found here that I have on mental layaway. They also have a really dope swimwear section. I bought a two piece here that was pricey but I rocked it at the river and a few lakes this summer and didn't see anyone else with the same one. There's nothing worse than showing up at party cove and someone else is wearing your same bikini.

While waiting for a show to start at the Marquee we came by La Fonda for a quick bite. Quick it was!  Walking in everything looked dirty- walls, booths- kinda cramped together. The service was good and super fast, we had our food within minutes. The downside was that everything tasted old. The chips tasted like old grease, the guac was brownish, and the tortilla from my chimichanga tasted like Mission brand.  I've had better at Filibertos. The worst part is they charge an extra $3 for beans and rice.  Hello! Beans and rice is a staple not a surcharge!

I had a hard time deciding on what to buy here.  I mean, I just wanted it all - panties with ruffles on the bottoms, pasties with tassels, a fishnet full body suit, knee high patent pleather boots, corsets, a french maid costume, garter belts, stockings with lace at the top of the thigh, a paddle and a whip - I'm getting carried away.  Lingerie Superstore has a great selection, it's a little on the pricey side, I've bought some of their stuff through online websites for less money.  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I've been back several times and always received awesome service.

I don't know why I keep eating at Panda.  I think I had good Panda once and I keep going back to repeat the experience but it's never good.    As I was leaving, I went to refill my drink and one of the employees came to the drink station and opened the bottom cabinet door where I was standing and it smacked my legs.  I gave him this look like "are you fucking kidding me" and he just stood there with the door still opened and pressing against my legs.  So then I said "are you fucking kidding me" and he acted like he had no idea what was going on, and said "what? oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there."  What a cop out.

What's not to like - discount books, comfy chairs, coffee - sounds good to me.  There are never a lot of people here so I can always grab a seat.  My only interaction with the workers are when I pay and I've never had any problems there.  This is my relaxation hot spot!

This isn't my normal grocery store but I was throwing a party for a group of kids near this Fry's.  In order to make things easier on myself, I called a week in advance and placed an order from their deli.  I ordered for a ton of kids food, 4 platters of chicken tenders, 2 platters of finger sandwiches, 2 platters of s'mores, 2 platters of deviled eggs.  When I arrived, my order was ready and I looked over everything as they brought it out.  When they brought out the finger sandwiches, I examined both trays and I was so disappointed.  The sandwiches looked like they had been just thrown onto the platter (see picture).  It looked like a sandwich salad.  I stopped the lady from ringing me up and told her to take a look at the sandwiches and tell me if she thought they were acceptable.  She admitted they were not and called over her manager.  I said "these sandwiches are unacceptable, look at how tiny some of these slices of bread are." Her response was that they were supposed to look like that because the crusts were cut off.  I explained that it looked like the sandwiches had just been thrown onto the platter and there is no way to tell where one sandwich stops and the other starts, how will kids know where to grab from?  She continued to argue with me and said that she could tell where to grab them from.  I told her I needed to speak to the store manager and she said that she would remake the sandwiches.  I said I didn't have time for that, my party starts in 20 minutes.  So, she gave me the sandwiches for free but she was not happy about it.    I let go of the sandwich fiasco and enjoyed the party.  The chicken was delicious, everyone loved the deviled eggs as well, no one touched the sandwiches.  I was sitting on a bench next to my adorable little cousin and we were chatting while he was eating a s'more.  I watched his cute little face bite into a delicious s'more with all this glory and when his mouth parted from the other half of the s'more, out came a glob of hair stuck to the marshmallow.  Epic fail x2 Fry's.    If you need to order food from a grocery store deli, do not come here.

HUGE beers, lots of big TV's, yummy apps, what more could you want in a sports bar?!  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because their beers on tap are lacking.  I've never had bad service and I really do appreciate how clean and new everything looks in there.

I had an excellent visit here for a pedi/mani!  I was seated as soon as I walked in and a nice young gentleman went to work right away on my manicure.  All of the tools were straight out of the autoclave which I really appreciate.  He did a great job.  Next we moved over to a pedicure chair and it was the nicest chair I've used in a salon - top of the line.  I changed my mind literally four times when choosing a color for my toes and he didn't mind or even roll his eyes at me.  The last time though he suggested a color and put a design on my toes.  I'm not into designs on my nails, I think they're childish but he made them look unique.  Everything about my experience was worthy of 5 stars, great decor, clean, friendly, long hand and foot massages, all of the other customers were happy with their services.  I'll be back for sure.  *Update* I came back while this review was waiting to be post and had another service worthy of five stars.

I passed by this studio after watching a movie nearby and decided I might like to paint some pottery.  The doors were open so I walked right in, it was empty except for two women working there.  As I walked towards the pottery, one older woman started quickly walking towards me with this scowl - I flashed her my pearly whites and she still approached me as if she was about to go medieval on my ass.    I have no idea why she was so cranky but hell if I was gonna drop a dime in there, I bolted.

The worst customer service ever.  I went shopping here with my little shorty and a sales clerk clearly hit her in the head with a backpack that she was carrying and just kept on walking.  I had to call the lady back and gave her a lesson in being polite to others like her momma should have done.  Then when it came time to pay we had to deal with this horrendous Snooki wannabe who didn't know how to work the register and treated me like it was my fault.  When she called someone over to help her, the two of them started fighting with each other and then Snookie pulled in a third guy and started bitching at him - no joke.  I wanted bash their heads together and walk out without paying but jail isn't really an option at this point in my life so I just put up with their crap.  I will never set foot in this store again.

What a shithole.  I came to watch some MMA fights in the parking lot of this sad establishment. The parking lot was a secret garden compared to the inside.  After a few cocktails by the ringside my girlfriends and I didn't want to use the port-a-potty so we went inside to use their restrooms. It was disgusting, everything was filthy and run down. There was a hallway you had to cross from the bingo room to the casino, the hallway wreaked of urine, like people had been pissing in there for years.  My buddy tried to get me some free stuff for my birthday from the casino and I told him to forget it, I didn't want to touch anything in there.   Never again.

I had the best carnitas breakfast burrito that I've ever had in my life at this location.   I've been back to get it several times but they've never had them again.  Do yourself a favor, if you're here in the morning and you see that they have carnitas breakfast burritos, get one! (and then PM me and tell me they're there)

You just can't be in a bad mood after you walk in here, you can't.  As soon as you walk in, the music is bumpin and your nose gets filled with all types of delicious smells, it's like a daily fiesta that everyone is invited to, I love it!  You can't beat the price of the produce and the selection has all ingredients that you need for Latin cuisine.  The same with the meat, the cuts and selection can't be found at Safeway so that makes this place my go to grocer for chile and carne.  The more American mainstream products by Kraft, Frito Lay, Coke, etc. are always higher priced and so I don't recommend stocking up on that stuff from here.

I was in a pickle and discount came through for me.  At the last minute on a Friday morning I decide to run down to Tucson to help my girlfriend move.  All of my tires are new except one, which I had already been warned to replace but I knew I could still squeeze a couple thousand miles out of that rubber.  Conundrum ensued: do I risk the drive there and back in the hottest part of the summer while driving on the death trap, also known as The Ten.  OR do I lose precious moving time by getting this tire replaced.  Visions of burning my kneecaps while changing a tire and having semi's whiz by forced me into this Discount.  I arrived by 8:00 and I was out by 8:30.  I was treated with respect and courtesy by the employees who helped me.  The women's bathroom was clean.  I'll be sure to come back here when I burn out these rubbers.

I came in here to rent some linens because the vinyl table cloths weren't going to cut it for this shindig, dahliing.  Evelyn really worked to make sure that I was getting the best deal.  Like, I wanted some skirting to go around the table but she told me how to work it so the table still looked good and I didn't have to pay for the added linens.    Also, while I was walking around I saw this huge massive fan, I can't get it out of my head.  I can't wait to find a purpose to rent that sucker.  They also seemed to have a lot of stuff for weddings, which won't help me at all but it may help you.

Thee best car wash in West Gilbert, believe me, I've tried them all for ya!  After a horrible experience at Classic Car Wash, I was forced to hop on my "around me" app and look for the next closest car wash and I found this little gem.... the one car wash I hadn't tried in a 15 mile radius.    So, what makes Francis so special you ask?  To start they give a voucher for a free carwash that can be used for up to SEVEN DAYS.  That's right, shout it from the roof top bruthas and sistahs.  No one in the valley does that!  Also, when they were cleaning my car, they took out the rubber linings for the cup holders and cleaned them!  I was in love at that point.  My husband tipped and then I double tipped, they did a really great job!

Cab Driver: which way do you want me to take you Me: The cheapest way  Thirty dollars later I arrived to The Cosmo from McCarren.  I wasn't in Vegas for long so I didn't want to waste time walking from casino to casino so we hopped in one of these cabs several times throughout the night.  Always had amazing cab drivers.  I asked one of them to charge my iphone and he did.  Then, like a pendeja, I left it in there.  The next day the driver came back to the hotel after his shift and brought me my phone!!  Totally worthy of 5 stars and then some!

Steiner's has an incredible selection of beer.  If you enjoy craft beers, this is the place for you!  The food was tasty - I got a Kobe burger and fries, the burger was huge and I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  The service was great, the decor was relaxed, comfortable and clean.  I'm jealous of anyone who gets to call this place their regular hang out.

I followed yelp reviews here and I'm so glad I did!  I'm very happy with my haircut from Jenny.  It's so hard to find someone who understands my mop because it's naturally curly but I straighten it and put larger curls in there.  If I leave it naturally curly, I look like a homegirl.  Jenny's hair is the same exact way (except its a gorgeous reddish color) so she knew how to cut my hair and gave me exactly what I wanted.    I'm going back next week to get my tips lightened, just in time for sun kissed summer hair - can't wait.

After a grueling hike on Saturday mornings I like to indulge with breakfast.  Switch's Fried Toast is a common item for such a craving.  It's very delicious and flavorful, crispy on the outside and soggy in the inside.  I think between my husband and I we've tried everything on the breakfast menu.  Nothing has been disappointing.    The service is meh.  The servers always seem like they have something better going on.  Once we ordered French press coffee and the server made fun of us because we didn't know what it was.  It's called "trying something new" you bounder!

Pratt's is more than a pet store, it's a zoo.  I saw the most beautiful turkey here and I think turkeys are hideous but this one was beautiful and all white.   Chickens. Emus. Ducks. Turtles. Snakes. Doves. Peacocks. Goats. Parakeets. Rabbits and a chinchilla.  That's all I can think of right now but there's more. Many more.  I bought some baby chicks here and they Pratts staff have all been helpful and informative with getting the coop together.  The feed is reasonably priced as well.  Next on the family pet list: finches...then the big tortoise in my pic!

I work in Tempe and whenever a co-worker asks me for a good dive bar, I direct them to Yucca.  This is a great spot for day drinking, they open at 6 am.  The drinks are cheap.  The bartenders are fast and friendly, what more could you want in a dive!

I haven't been this overwhelmed with excitement since I went to Disneyland.  Immediately upon entering I was taken back by the decor, fish tanks, waterfall and life like animals on display.  I spent two hours in here, I wanted to see every inch.    The only bad part of the experience was the lady at the fudge stand.  She was not a happy camper but the delicious fudge made up for it.  This place is way out of my budget and I would never buy any of the necessities for outdoor life here but I purchased some novelty things and will continue to come back.

This may be the nicest bowling alley I've ever been to, ever.  I usually get junked out about sticking my fingers into the bowling balls and putting my feet in used shoes.  However, the place was so nice and clean I didn't even think about it (that much).  When we grabbed our shoes I asked if we needed to place orders somewhere and they said a server would be by to take care of us.  No one ever came but now that I've read the reviews I think that was probably a good thing because it's expensive.    Can't wait to come back and grab some drinks at the bar, it looked really nice.

Pockets is the nicest bowling alley lounge evah!  My date and I went out the night before the 4th of July and we stopped at three other bars before coming here, they were all packed.  I remembered how large this bar was and how it seemed to be dead so I suggested we come here.  It turned out to be an excellent spot for a date.  Great selection of beers on tap.  Our bartender was solid!  She overheard us talking about "frickles" (fried pickles) and said they were her favorite thing on the menu so we tried them, they were surprisingly delicious.  We split a pitcher and then headed to the game room - we laughed the entire time.  So much fun!

I can't believe people can find shit to bitch about at the fair.  Carnies, questionable food, questionable rides for that matter, animals, all of those neat projects that people submit for prizes, demolition derby, B rate concerts, the list goes on of all of the cool stuff you can see at the fair.  A lot of people would like to see the fair grounds demolished and probably built up into some beige stucco bullshit - to those people I say bite your tongue!  The  Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum may look ugly as shit to you but it hold many great memories for this old broad.    I guess if you have a stick up your ass, the State Fair isn't the place for you.  But if you don't mind getting a little dirty and like to act like a kid, this place can be a lot of fun!

I happened upon this place by total accident when I pulled into it's parking lot to flip a uturn. When I saw it served coffee AND it had a drive-thru I couldn't resist. The drive-thru menu seemed sparse but I settled on a frozen latte to cure my cottonmouth. As I pulled to the window I started kicking myself for ordering a drink I knew would take time to make, I meant it to be a quick stop. While at the window I noticed more menu items taped up and peeked inside and saw a display of food which I didn't recall on the menu. Luckily the service was really quick and I was back on my way in no time. The latte was perfect not bitter or too sweet. I'll have to go back and sample their snacks too.

I love their margherita pizza, the crust is perfectly crisp, the sauce is flavorful and tangy and the basil and mozzarella are fresh just like they should be.    The inside is pretty small and the tables and chairs aren't particularly comfy.  I've driven by and seen a line down the sidewalk and although it's good, I wouldn't wait in a line to eat here.  The service is great, very sweet people working here.  I once called in to order a pizza togo and they wouldn't do it because they said the pizza would be soggy by the time I got there.  I told them that I had been forewarned and to do it anyway but they refused.  That didn't make me happy but I see their point, they want their food to be enjoyed as it supposed to taste.

CPK fell off the map for me after a few bad experiences at their Biltmore location back in the early '00's.  Well, it's back on the map!    I came in for lunch at my moms request.  I was happy to see a more versatile menu as well as the same ol' hits like the cobb salad that my mom always orders.  I had half a brie and turkey sandwich with sliced pears and it tasted like something out of trendy downtown restaurant and not like it came off the kitchen line from a chain restaurant.  Well done CPK.

This is really the only reason I venture to the Mills mall.  The home furnishings, the handbags, the jewelry, the clothes, oh my!  I came here recently in search of a cocktail dress and although I couldn't find anything I liked, they were having a 35% off sale so I scored some Father's Day loot.  I can always find something great here.  One star off for always looking dirty and disheveled - I know you're a Last Call at the Mills but you're still a Neiman Marcus.

I was really impressed by the service here, quick, friendly and awesome.    I did a quick scan of the wall of teas to choose from and settled on Yerba Mate as soon as I saw it because it reminded me of Logie and her crazy tea thread.  The tea was brewed to perfection and in three minutes I was drinking delicious iced tea.    This is a really laid back place and I always see people on their laptops here so I'm assuming they have free wifi too.  Cool decor - my new favorite coffee house.

This Costco has a weird set-up - it makes you understand that not all Costcos are alike.  It's inside of a mall which makes it less busy than the other Costco's in the area.  But the food stand is outside of the Costco and inside of the mall so the line is always impossibly long.    Also, I think the deli is lacking in comparison to the Costco's in the west valley.  This would probably be my third favorite Costco but it's still awesome.

This mountain is filled with recreational options like camping, biking, riding and hiking AND it's close to the city.  It costs $6 to get in and there is an interesting Nature Center that I think is worthwhile if you have some time to kill.  I mostly enjoy all of the hiking options.  The trails can accommodate every level of hiker and almost every distance.  The paths are very well maintained and the shorter trails provide periodic benches and stands with nature descriptions.

I would have never found this place if it hadn't been for good 'ol Yelp.  To say it's a "hidden gem" is an understatement.  Even using my GPS, I got lost.  My friend meeting me there also got lost.  I shoulda snapped a picture of the entrance for my fellow Yelpers.  Walking in I didn't really know what to expect.  The decor wasn't cohesive... pink doily place mats and a large red wall.  There was only one other person sitting in the small bistro when I walked in.  As I sat and waited for my lost friend I enjoyed some wine and delicious freshly baked bread.  The cashier/server was very attentive and helpful.    Now for the good stuff:  For starters to our main course, my friend and I both had a bowl of French Onion Soup.  Perfect combination of green and white onions with cheesy goodness and a slice of sunflower seed bread on top.  I'm not sure how they did it but the bread wasn't a total soggy mess.  There was still some crunch to the crust.  I didn't want to stop eating it but I had to make room for my main course... the Roasted Veal and Potatoes.  Let me just say that it was very hard to settle on this dish.  Everything on the menu sounded so good.  Then the server came by and said the lunch menu was also available for dinner.  I couldn't handle it - I saw a brie sandwich and knew I had to make serious decisions.  I ended up going with the veal and my friend had the mussles.  As our food came and I tasted my first bite, suddenly the pink doilies and the red wall faded.  La Vie en Rose started playing in my head and I was transported to the cobblestone streets of France.  Dare I say it was the best piece of veal I've ever had?  The yellow sauce it was laying on top of was a creamy delight.  Also underneath the meat were square cut potatoes, cooked perfectly.    The owner, or who I assumed was the owner, came by and showed us how they take the mussle out of its shell in France.  A very neat trick.  You'll have to ask him how to do it when you visit.  I wish I could say I kept room for desert but I couldn't stop eating the veal.  It will just give me another reason to go back.  Maybe I'll start with the desert first this time... live on the wild side.  I rarely give out 5 starts but any food that can take me to France with just one bite is well worth it.

Every time I go to an AMC, I kick myself for not going to a Harkins instead.  As soon as I walked in the place smelled like burnt popcorn, that should have been my first clue to leave.  I stood in line and waited my turn to get a soda and popcorn and my buddy went to go find us some seats.  When it was my turn I told the guy working the counter that I didn't want any of that burned popcorn and he said they threw it out.  Unfortunately, they have a do-it-yourself soda dispenser and so after you wait in line to get popcorn and a cup for your soda, you have to wait in another line to fill the cup.  This has got to be the worst idea ever, people struggling to balance their popcorn and snacks while working a touch screen with a 100 different soda selections, what a clusterfuck.  I finally get to my seat as the movie starts and I lean back in my chair and it gives out this loud screech so I make a mental note to sit upright the entire movie.  Then my friend starts moving around in his seat and it's also squeaking so I razz him about finding the two loudest chairs in the theater but as time passes I realize that ALL the seats in the theater are in desperate need of WD-40, it was like a symphony of squeaky seats.  Already, the experience isn't going well but then I nibbled down the top layer of popcorn and I realized that the rest of the back was small overcooked kernels.  I spent the next five minutes debating whether or not to miss part of the movie so I could go lay into these swill merchants.  I decide against it because the movie did cost more than the popcorn although they were both ridiculously overpriced.

My Favorite spa in the Valley. Words cannot describe how happy this place makes me.    I checked in for a facial and was greeted with warmth and kindness.  The wonderful smell of this place is something that I look forward to in between each visit.  I want my entire home to smell like Revive.  I was staying at the resort with family for a special occasion so I didn't make an all day event out of my visit to the spa but god knows you can - the private pool, cabanas, and women's locker room make it so comfortable that it's hard to rip myself away.    The facial was so relaxing and my skin felt wonderful for days afterwards.  The esthetician spoke in a very calming voice and gave me a step by step introduction to everything she was doing to my skin.  Everything she did felt so good, it was difficult to stay awake, very enjoyable.    Afterwards, there was no pressure to buy all of the products she used and I really appreciate that, the facial is pricey itself.  I can't wait to come back, I LOOOOOOVE this spa!

I've been craving a shrimp PoBoy since I left Louisiana, the land of tasty PoBoy's.   I drove by this place and flipped a bitch so that I could check it out for lunch. It looks a little uninviting from the outside. I was very surprised to find a quaint little bar and seating area. I thought it was going to be more of a take out place and I almost turned around and walked out because I had my puppy in the car and didn't plan on leaving him. But the woman behind the bar was very inviting and told me she could have my poboy out in five minutes. I told her I'd be in the car with my dog but I'd come back in a couple minutes to get my order. Sure enough, five minute later she comes walking out with my order. I thought it was really great customer service to bring it out to my car for me.   The poboy was satisfactory. The breading on the shrimp was too thick and the shrimp was lost in there, everything else about the sandwich was great, especially the roll. The fries were fat, long and perfectly seasoned, all fries should be made like this.   I will be back for some √âtouff√©e and this time leave the dog at home so I can enjoy a cold one at the bar.

I really love this place.  The food is just okay but there's a live band, dancing, fire pits for roasting marshmallows, pool tables, horse shoes, it goes on and on.  Feel free to dress up in western gear when you come here, you'll feel right at home.  Yeehaw!

What an adorable place to hike, so quick and easy, in and out.  It took me 45 minutes to hike up the most prominent hill and loop around back towards the parking lot.  I usually hike South Mountain and once I start I can't stop, I want to be out there all day exploring new trails.  Luckily, Thunderbird doesn't have that many options; apparently it has 15 miles worth of trails but it seems small.  This is also the cleanest place I've hiked, I didn't see once speck of trash.  If I lived in the area I would be out on these hills every morning.   The trails here are super easy and I would recommend it to beginners.

Dear Revolving Sushi inventor, I fell in love with you today, thank you for your contribution to our society.    When my coworker invited me to check out this place with her I jumped at the chance.  Although I was a little nervous that it was so cheap, I was determined to replace my qualms with a sense of adventure. Luckily, we arrived for lunch at 11:00, I know it's early but by 11:30 eager sushi eaters started coming out of the woodwork and had to wait for a seat.  As we sat down the server took our drink orders and gave us our drinks rather quickly.  That was the last time we saw her until the check came.  I can't say enough good things about what it's like to sit down at your table and already have the food in front of you.  The first thing I tried was the salmon sashimi it was honestly one of the best pieces of salmon I've ever had.  Next I tried the tuna sashimi, meh, not so much.  Everything after that was delicious.  My coworker and I just kept grabbing and grabbing.  The plates ranged from $1.00 - $2.00.  When our bill came it was $26, for both of us!  Stop what you're doing and go eat there, you will not be disappointed.

I think the produce here so cheap because F&E gets it on it's way out.  I've never bought anything here that lasted for more than a couple of days before mold consumes it.  What they undercharge for in produce they overcharge for in everything else.    This store is on my way home from work so I would pop in for the bare essentials.  Good thing too because bare essentials sums up the amount of items they carry.  Although, they do have a decent selection of cheese.  Other than that it's pretty easy shopping - clean store, self checkout, not too bad.  There's a bus stop right outside the door and coming or going I always get asked for money.  F&E used to offer $5 off coupons for every $20 you spend which was amazing to me.  When that deal expired there was no reason left for me to go there.

This is my favorite public pool in the entire valley.  It's super cheap - 2.25 for adults, 1.00 for kids.  You can bring in drinks and snacks as long as they are not in a cooler (weird).  They have a snack bar. It's very clean.  Oh and the most important part, they have a lazy river, two big water slides, a whirlpool, toddler play area with more slides, basketball, lap pool, diving boards.... I think that's it.  It's quite a drive but it's worth it.

They have a really great brunch on the weekends!  I had some crab stuffed crepes that the bartender recommended and they were better than I could have hoped for - yum!  I also tried a few signature cocktails and they were just as good.  It's nice to see something different on a drink menu.  Service was excellent, very clean, nice decor.  All around a great dinning experience.

I was on my way out of town and I swung by my dads to give him a kiss goodbye before I left.  As I pulled in, my check engine light came on.  My auto guys are in the east valley where I live so I hopped on my Yelp app and found Honest-1 Auto care.    I was in and out in less than 30 minutes.  The issue was completely benign and doesn't effect my vehicles performance.  I was relieved and delighted that they didn't tell me it was something that needed to be fixed ASAP just to make money.

I've stayed away from Yard House because its a chain however, there are virtually no other places in the area that have a decent selection of craft beer.  Holy fuckamole does this place have an amazing selection of craft beer.  I've only been a handful of times but the bartenders are awesome and know my face and call me IPA girl.

Considering 2 out of 4 of us didn't eat our meal, I'm gonna say it wasn't a good dining experience.  I had a steak that was tough but raw inside, I wanted to send it back but it was already to tough to chew, any longer on the flame wouldn't help.  Another ordered fish and it was so covered in oil that it was inedible.  The service was good and everyone working there was very friendly but even good service cant distract from the appearance.  This place is just so filthy.  Tchotchke's fill every nook and cranny and they appear to have never been dusted.  Wall to wall carpet that is stained so it adds to the unclean appearance.  It just felt gross inside.

Yay for covered parking!  I like that this library also has a cafe that serves coffee and snacks.  If you need a quite space, reserve a study room because there are always inconsiderate people who think the library is the best place to chat and make phone calls.

I love the simplicity here, the d√©cor, the menu, the staff - clean cut and to the point.  I come here with a wine drinker so I usually get wine too.  I think they have a great selection of reasonably priced wines that are also good quality.  The restrooms are fun.... walking up/down to them when you've had a few cocktails and you're wearing heels, not so much.

It's hard to believe people can have a bad experience at Montelucia.    I had a little staycation here with some friends to celebrate my birthday.  The grounds were beautiful, the rooms were spacious and luxurious - no detail was overlooked, everything was in it's place and looked like perfection. The landscape was amazing, tons of little spots to kick back and have a drink and some laughs - pools, lawns, fountain, fire pits, garden - all gorgeous areas with comfy seating.  I've been dying to go to the Joya Spa for years and it was worth the wait.  Again, it was beautifully decorated, calming and peaceful.  I received excellent spa service and was treated like a queen.  I LOVE the way spa's smell!  Ahh such a wonderful experience.  To finish off our weekend we all had the Sunday brunch, it was a nice spread, and we all agreed that the food was delicious.  The dinning room was lovely and we had great service.  We had great service from check-in to check-out, it felt like we were being treated like VIP's.

This is one of my favorite places in Vegas.  I had the absolute best time here!  The drinks are phenomenal, there are video games at the bar, I made friends with everyone sitting around me, the bartenders are awesome.  How can anyone find fault with a Tiki bar?

I've been to our State Capitol several times but the last time was the most impressive.    I had misplaced my notary stamp in a recent move and I had to get a new one in a pinch, this also required getting a copy of my license.  The Secretary of State, Ken Bennett's office handles the notary licensing so I made a mad dash for their office inside the Capitol when I got off work one day.  I had 30 minutes to get from Tempe to this office before they closed so I was very rushed and frazzled.  I left my truck in the parking lot at 4:58 and kicked off my heels so I could sprint across the street and lawn then into the building.  As soon as I opened the door, I was taken back by how "Arizona" this building is inside.  I was immediately transported back to childhood because the smell of the building and the decor was so much like the school and church buildings I went to as a child.  It's old school Arizona.  I've read the reviews and I understand how this building could come across as old and shitty but I'm telling you, if you're a native who loves our state, you'll totally get this place.  It's how Arizona was before beige stucco took over and it warmed my heart to be here.  I had been here before but I never appreciated its charm as much as I did this particular time when I was rushed and in no mood to reminisce.    There wasn't a single person in sight and so I kept my heels in my hand as I ran through the corridor.  When I could see the security guard and metal detector, I put my heels back on and told him what I was there for and he said I was too late, it was 5:00 already, I asked him to let me try anyway and he did!  When I approached the notary office, they were closed so I waited and caught two people leaving and I explained the situation and begged them to help.  It worked!  I was so grateful to them for helping me out and staying a few minutes late.  With the copy of my certificate in hand, I walked back and the security guard congratulated me on my negotiating skills.  I got a chance to look around on my way out and enjoy our State's Capitol for a bit.

You know you've got it easy when your worst nightmare is cracking your iphone screen.  The time came where it finally happened to me and my first thought was just to live with it until my upgrade was available but I couldn't tough it out.  One of my friends told me about this place and I jumped at the chance to get my iphone fixed before I went on vacation.  It took 30 minutes and  $75 bucks.  Not bad.  I also picked up a phone case while I was there to protect my little gem.  Sidenote: my iphone died a week later while on vacation and I had to buy another one anyway.  You break my heart over and over again, iphone.

The service was great we were greeted with a friendly smile and our server was quick and attentive.  We shared a caprese salad and pizza.  The caprese was good and hit the spot.  The pizza was good too.  I liked the crunchy crust but it was a little dry.    We asked for some ranch and we were lectured on the fact that "real pizza" isn't served with ranch and they don't carry it.  Look, I understand that ranch on your pizza isn't for everyone but it chaps my hide when restaurants try to dictate how patrons should eat their meals.  The first I heard of this is when steakhouses refused to serve A-1 with their steaks because it was an insult to their perfectly prepared meat.  Seriously?  I think it's a testament to your food when you offer the condiments and the meal is good enough to stand on its own, but let the person eating the meal decide on that.  What's next, ketchupless fries?

For lunch I had the Porky - it had roasted apples inside which added sweet detail.  They have Boddingtons on tap - that's my bff's favorite beer so I ordered one and sent him a pic for jealousy purposes.  It's a good beer, a little thicker than I'd prefer but being too thick is never a bad thing.    Service was friendly but slow.

Very delicious Mexican food.  I'd give it five stars except I taste two cooks in this kitchen, one makes magic happen and the other is a novice.  So it's hit or miss  but when you hit, I'm confident it's one of the best Mexican spots in the Valley.

It was 8:30 on a weeknight and even though I had some chicken defrosted and ready to cook at home, I knew I wouldn't be done with cooking and cleaning until 10:00 pm.  So I hopped on my trusty Yelp app to see what I could pick up on my way home that was not fried or greasy and this little gem popped up.  I turned off Camelback onto 23rd Ave and the dark road looked bleak, the surroundings were questionable so I wanted to turn around but I persevered to the next block and the deli appeared on the left.  When I drove up, it looked EXACTLY like a deli you would find on the street corners of the east coast, it was uncanny.  Anyway, even though they were about to close and cleaning up the kitchen, the nice woman behind the counter totally hooked me up with some delicious sandwiches.  They were packed with meat and the bread was delicious, both people working there were extremely friendly and happy for the business.  I'll be back for sure!

They have the best server here.  Seriously, if serving was a sport, there would be scouts trying to steal this guy away from this Arriba's.  I wish all servers were exactly like him.  He puts great thought and attention into his suggestions.  Aside from server of the year, Arriba's is a my favorite of the Garcia/Macayo type of Mexican food chains.  The food tastes fresh and it seems like there's some thought behind the menu, not just the typical meals.  It's not my first pick of restaurants but they have cheap margaritas!

I just completed my second month of boot camp and I'm going back for more!  I dunno, there's something about being pushed to my limits everyday that gives me such a sense of accomplishment - I can't find it anywhere else.  I had done another boot camp in the East Valley so I have some basis for comparison; that boot camp was more like social hour for cliques. This boot camp is an incredible workout! I can tell because my muscles were still getting sore up until the last day. Tammy is the instructor and she is amazing. She keeps the group motivated and is constantly encouraging. It's obvious that Tammy is well-versed in fitness, health and nutrition; she goes into detail and explains what's going on with our bodies. She's very involved and checks our form and gives tips for better performance and to prevent injury.  People from all walks life and fitness levels matriculate to this class.  As different as we are, the sweat and tears bond us during the intense one hour workout.   The down side? Now that the sun is coming out earlier it's sucks to see how many people look great at 5:30 in the morning... I look like the crypt keeper.

I was nervous about coming here during the summer but it turned out to be really lovely.  We arrived around 8:30 for a Mumford and Sons show, by the time we parked, bought a t-shirt, grabbed some craft beers and sat down, it was 9:00 - not bad.  We sat chatting for a bit and I realized that the weather was quite beautiful and I looked up and saw a few stars and thought it was pretty cool to be catching one of my favorite bands outside on such a great night, I felt positively blissful.    For an outside venue it was pretty nice.  I was excited that when I walked in I saw a huge sign for craft beer.  It was a $1 less than the jumbo beers in a can that everyone was walking around with.  The seats weren't as uncomfortable as the stadium seating at the D-Backs game.  Although I was sitting next to an obese man who's thighs took up a quarter of my chair... I felt he owed me a beer at the very least.    One thing though:  I notice this place is now called Ashley Furniture Homestore Pavilion.  That's some bullshit.  Can we all agree that whatever owners change hands of our stadiums/pavilions, we'll still call it by ONE name.

The food and the ambiance were 5 stars!  I really liked the d√©cor here, someone put a lot of thought into the design, it's sexy and sophisticated.  To drink I had a whiskey cocktail off their menu, it was tasty.  For dinner I had a duck and foie gras ravioli which was sooo yum, the picture I took doesn't do it justice.  The service was just okay.

It's a greasy spoon that I've been going to since I was a small child.  Some of the same servers are still working there and I love them, they are on top of their game.  I usually order the skillet with green chile and flour tortillas, absolutely delicious.  It's old and the booths are torn up but I don't care, I love it!

My mom and I were lured into this place by these gorgeous bar stools sitting outside. I loved everything in here, of course there are a few wacky exceptions but as we walked around it was obvious that whoever is purchasing items for this store has an eye for style.   The sales staff was great, very friendly and engaging but not the type to follow us around in an annoying way. They were knowledgeable about the pieces they had in the store. Which is refreshing because in some second hand stores there's a lot of "I don't know" and "I'm not sure."   Neither one of us left empty handed. Mom bought a huge rooster for her kitchen. As for me I got a beautiful, unique china hutch that makes me smile each time I look at it. I'm so glad I've held off on buying one because I haven't seen anything compares to the one I got from Peaceful Soul.

Whatever you do, do not come here after a few mimosas with your gay bestie.  You'll think you can tackle any home improvement project together.  Bad idea.  I always have the best experience with the staff when I come here.  From fixing my toilet to buying paint to planting flowers - these guys have helped me every step of the way.  I usually prefer Lowes to Home Depot but this store is making me change my ways.

I had tried Petite Mason before at a Yelp event and always had intentions of going there.  My friend was visiting from Hawaii and wanted to eat something she couldn't have on the island. I figured French cuisine would suit us both.  This lil spot is tucked away off Scottsdale road. We arrived just past 5:00 pm and parking was a cinch.  Walking into the patio was cozy and adorable - beautiful plants and a little fire place in the corner.  We knew right away we wanted to sit outside because it was a gorgeous evening.  Our server was attentive and pleasant. To start we shared a salad with fresh yellow tomatoes.  For the main course I ordered bouillabaisse and white wine and my friend ordered filet mignon and a red wine.  I tried my friends beef; dare I say it was better than Durant's?  Blasphemy!  I know but it was so tender and juicy, it blew me away!  The bouillabaisse was good too; I've never had it before so I don't have anything to compare it to. The shrimp tasted a little over cooked but the broth it was so flavorful, I wanted to bring the dish to my lips and tip back my head and slurp it all down.  All in all, it was a superb dining experience and I will be back for sure.

As long as I've been working in an office I've been shopping at NY&Co.  Its affordable clothing that lasts the test of time and they have really good sales.  Like the day I came here I bought dress slacks - buy one get one FREE.  I also wanted a 3/4 sleeve blazer that I found online but they didn't have it in stock so I went to the NY&Co at Chandler Fashion Square.    This store is very clean and orderly, the sales staff was great.

I love Donna's!  I drove past one early morning and saw the open sign and thought "what the heck, I should check it out."  Donna's has the most delicious looking pastries.  I recently had a party and I ordered my cake here.  It pleased the masses and everyone wanted to know where I got my cake from.  They also serve up some quick breakfast sandwiches and an assortment of readymade breakfast burritos - the potatoes are always cooked to perfection, something that must be hard for other places to grasp because I've had plenty of half cooked potatoes in my breakfast burritos.  Donna's knows what's up.

It sucks that my liquor cabinet has a huge selection of booze but they're all only about a quarter inch full.  Now enter Total Wine and More.  I get weak in the knees when I come in here.  I just want it all.  I LOVE the fact that they always have wine tasting going on when I come in and I can be counted on to buy a bottle of whatever they are serving up, gotta support the cause.  One of my favorite places to shop!

It's the bees knee's man!   We ducked into this spot on a rainy day for lunch and I'm so glad we did. My husband and I were sat right in front of the window and watch the cars splash by. I was going to order a Red Stripe (yes! they have Red Stripe) and the bartender suggested Longboard which they have on tap. This malty beer was a joy to drink, so refreshing, it hit the spot. For lunch I had the Hula's Island Cobb, very delicious. I was skeptical about the spam but it ended up being a great substitute for bacon. My only gripe is the chicken was described as "marinated" on the menu which sold me on the salad but when I had it the meat was plain. My hubs had the Luau Pork Sandwich and it's truly heaven on a bun, served with yummy sweet potato fries. Both meals were large portions and we finished every bite.   We had a really good time at Hula's, great service, delish food & beer. We will be going back fo sho! Oh, and I should also mention that the silverware is now wrapped in cloth napkins. If I would have read these reviews before my visit Amy's "fork door holder" story would have kept me away.

It's more like a shoe farm than a carnival - a lot of uninteresting shoes in large quantities.  I was really excited when this place opened up because there are not enough shoe stores in the world.  I've been in several times and it's always a let down, I think they need to get a new buyer before they go belly up.

I was without my iphone for 14 hours, 32 minutes and 57 seconds.  It was tough.  The worst part was that I didn't know what was wrong with the poor little guy, we were laying on the couch together and I picked him up and the light had left his body.  I couldn't get him on at all, he was dead.    I hopped on the laptop and made an appointment here immediately.  That's a lie.  First, I called my cell phone carrier like a pendeja and they insisted that I buy a new iphone immediately.  I did a cry/laugh THEN I made the Apple Store appointment for first thing the next morning.  Thank you so much for being open on Sundays!  Everyone here is super friendly and helpful!  They fixed my iphone in a blink of an eye and we were back in business in no time.  I love my iphone.  I wish I could have iphone babies with it, we'd call them.... iMoanz.

Meh, I've experienced better at this very same restaurant.  Twenty five years ago this restaurant was considered a great dining establishment and my family would go here for special occasions.  Every now and then we'll go here to reminisce and enjoy some BBQ.  Wow, have times changed.  I came here recently with my family and they had a new menu, not that great.  I had a BBQ sandwich which lead to an upset stomach all night long.  The restrooms were disgusting!  The only good thing I can say is that the service was and always has been great.  I can't imagine ever going back to this place again.  It's just too gross now.  Fair well!

A friend said she found this place on google under "dance clubs." Four of us showed up on a Friday night at 11:00 p.m. I'd say there were 30 people in there. They had a DJ playing meh music, smoking patio, darts, pool table, dead dance floor. The bathrooms were clean. I was acting as the designated driver for the night and they do not offer free soda for the DD's, bummer. The crowd was mainly males, really good looking ones, I remember thinking "there are some serious hotties on the West side." The bartender was attentive and nice. It's not a dance club at all, just me and another friend were the only ones that danced the entire night.   I played erotic photo hunt on the touch screen at the bar. "Moanz" is top 4 scores.

Laid back yet trendy dining spot in Old Town Scottsdale, I'm glad tried it out.    We came in on a Friday night at 8:00 and we were able to get a table right away.  We sat on the patio where they had a guy on the keyboard going to town with some jazz music, very nice ambiance.  I ordered their signature bloody Mary and it hit the spot, easy on the tomato juice, just like I like 'em.  For apps we had the tomato and basil bruschetta, the bread wasn't that great.  The menu had a nice selection of seafood, pasta and a nice steak but I settled on a burger which was cooked to perfection, very delicious.  I could only take a few bites and packed the rest to go, super huge burger.  The server was quick to bring out the drinks and food but she disappeared after that.  While we were eating our meal some random guy came up to our table and sat down.  We were both too polite to tell him to leave because he meant no harm and was obviously drunk; he just sat there talking to us while we ate... awkwarrrrd.  We kept trying to flag down the server to get our tab so we could bounce out but she never looked our direction when she was visiting the other tables.  We left as quickly as possible.

EWC offers some screaming deals for first time customers.  I loved how immaculate the place is, really great first impression.  The receptionist was a total sweetheart, she warmly greeted each customer that walked in.  Sarah did a great job on my waxing and made me feel comfortable which can't be easy when you're inflicting extreme pain on someone.

Sephora does for me what Tiffany does for Holly Golightly.  All the brightly lit walls filled with shiny, black lacquer rows of my favorite beauty products -- makes me feel like nothing bad can happen in a place like this.  Everything you need and everything you didn't know you needed, all in one stop shop.   The sales staff here are always very polite and helpful, I've never had a bad experience or felt pressured to buy anything.  One of the great things about shopping here is that Sephora stands behind their products and you can always return what you buy if it doesn't work out for you.

Wow.  This place is the epitome of Scottsdale douchyness.  They do have some great stores but try not to hang out here that much.  You don't want to lose touch with reality.

I'm such a horrible Coronado resident, I didn't even know Lisa G's closed.   Welcome Main Ingredient, it's so great to have you. This place is a really great addition to the already fabulous hot spots in the Coronado hood. But what I'm really excited about is the prices, not as steep as The Tuck Shop but the same great service and arguably food. I love the patio and decor it's a perfect neighborhood bar. I'm never in a hurry to leave once I get there.   The restrooms were tidy but I didn't like the fact that they were both communal bathrooms. The toilet seats were up in both bathrooms each time I went. C'mon! Let the ladies have their own bathroom!

Such a breeze.  I came the day after Christmas and received the document I needed in record time.  Including the walk from the parking lot, the entire visit took 8 minutes.    The inside could use a good power washing, it's dirty.  The parking can be a fiasco but if you call ahead there is a voice recording of a woman giving you 7 options on where to park nearby.

Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.  This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the "Grand Opening" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!  It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!  As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.

I've stopped by here every day this week and I get the same thing, a soda and a sandwich.  Monday it was $2.35, Tuesday $2.81, Wednesday $3.02.  I didn't come back on Thursday, at this rate of inflation I couldn't afford it.

I use Amici Catering for work functions, they never disappoint!  Either Lori, Scott or the chef will bring the food and set up.  On the ride up the elevator one day, I was chit chatting with them and discovered that they used to own Tuchetti's!  I freaking loved Tuchetti's and I never understood why they closed.  Seriously, when I worked in the Biltmore area I remember going there for lunch at like 11:00 a.m. because I couldn't wait!    Anyway, their catering services are awesome.  They do a great job in setting up, believe it or not some caterers just drop off the food and ask you to sign the invoice, but not them.  They are always well prepared and put on a nice presentation of their food.  I cannot say enough good things about how delicious their food is, from breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They offer breakfast croissant sandwiches with either egg ham and cheese OR egg mushroom and spinach, I've never had a better breakfast sandwich in my life.  The desserts are also amazing.  There's one called... the name escapes me but anyway, it's do die for -- individual cakes with chocolate gooeyness inside served with a side of whip cream, but nothing like cool whip, its the most delicious whip cream I've ever tasted, it shouldn't even be called whip cream anymore.  The rest of the food they make is just as good.   They really go out of their way to deliver top quality and I appreciate them!  I just wish they still had Tuchetti's so that I can get a fix in between work functions.

(this review is for Sephora only)  Ugh, this Sephora blows.  I didn't even know it was possible for a Sephora to suck so hard but it's completely due to the people that work here.  The only reason that I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because it's not the make ups fault that it has to be sold by people who hate the world around them.  I've been here several times because it's convenient to just pick something up but every single time, I've had to deal with their terrible customer service.  They act like you're putting them out by trying to pay for your items.  You're better off not asking them any advice or opinions on products either.   Next time I'm in a bad mood, I'm going to come here and take it out on them - return the favor.

This review is for the P.A. Mitch Bogle, I didn't see the doctor.  Mitch was great, he addressed my concerns effectively and had a pleasant demeanor.  The office staff was also very helpful and nice.  I noticed there were quite a few elderly patients in the office and they were treated respectfully and the staff never lost patience with them.  Although I went to Grand Canyon Dermatology for something very minor, I would recommend them to anyone because of their excellent service.  I will say this though, I hope they didn't add their business to Yelp.  Spelling 'dermatology' incorrectly isn't a good sign when you're in the business.

Searched for the best deal on mattresses, found them here.  The entire transaction of buying two beds took under ten minutes.  I handed the guy my money and he quickly loaded up the mattresses and box springs for me.   Beds have held up nicely so far.

My brake lights went out simultaneously.  So I figured it must be a fuse, right?  By the time I got around to opening up my fuse box and tinkering around in there, I realized that it wasn't the fuse and the bulbs burnt out.  So I whipped out my owners manual and tried to figure out how to change the bulbs - it's not hard, I've done the headlights before- but the tail lights required tools that I did not have in my possession.  I walked into AutoZone and asked them if they could change the bulbs for me and the nice gentleman working the counter told me it was a free service.  The entire process took under 10 minutes and he included some kind of bulb lube (that word makes me lol) to ensure longetivy to the bulbs.    Very quick and painless process.  Makes me wonder what else I can get these guys to do for free.

Usually I cool off from these things right away but this one really chapped my ass.  So I decided to take it a step further and get a hold of the manager and let him know about the situation, Rigo was his name.  Rigo never responded to any of my phone messages.  I took it another step further and filed a complaint with motor vehicle.    Rigo has people working for him who have no idea how to use their computer database.  This particular employee misapplied $500 cash that I paid and when I confronted her about it, she told me that I needed to take it up with motor vehicle instead of trying to fix it or ask someone for help when it was clearly her error.    I had to pay a fee that my ex had been slapped with when we owned vehicles together.  I couldn't get my car registered until I paid his $500 fee.  So when I paid the idiot working here $500 cash, she tells me that she can't register my vehicle because I still owe $500. I ask her to show me on her computer where it says that owe an additional $500 and she flips her monitor around and shows me some information that has my cars year, make and model but no $500 fee.  I told her that she didn't know what she was talking about nor did she know how to work a computer and she shouldn't be handling peoples money if she doesn't know what she's doing.  I asked for my money back so I could take it to another business, she said no. I asked to speak to the manager, she said she was the manager.  So I left.  Since it was end of business, I had to wait until the next day to get my tags from the DMV.  Of course when I go there, they tell me I owe $500.  I give them the receipt and after a while, the lady comes back and said "good thing you held onto this receipt, the person who you paid misapplied the funds and we would have never been able to find it if you didn't have this receipt."  Ha!  Well, it's a good thing to know that even really, really stupid people with careless attitudes can still find work here!  ***Kevin U. Thanks for the scolding but I gave the manager, Rigo every opportunity to rectify the situation and had he returned my phone calls, this review would never have been posted.  Other people in the area need to be aware of the business practices going on here.  I'm glad you received 4 star service but I didn't and that's what Yelp is here for, to provide insight into customers personal experience with the business at hand. In essence, this company stole $500 from me, had I not kept the receipt and followed up with DMV, I would be out $500.  A company who functions in that manner should be put on blast all day long.

This place is right next to my gym so I tried it out for convenience sake.    I love when these nail salons have nice d√©cor and big comfy pedi chairs.  But I know that doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get a good pedi.  However, Solare is nicely decorated and has top of the line pedi chairs with all the bells and whistles.  I was pleased to see they used a new tub liner for each pedicure to maintain sanitary conditions.  Also, tools were packaged up and fresh out of the sterilizer or autoclave.  It's such a great feeling of comfort when I see the salon is putting forth a huge effort to sanitize.   My pedicure was great.  Days later it's still holding up well.  I wanted a unique design on my toes and when I explained what I wanted she immediately told me how much extra it would cost.  That's never happened before!  Usually I get informed of extra charges when I pay.  All in all it was a great experience and I will be back.

Really great place to buy gifts for kids.  They have a nice selection of smaller items that can be used to fill space in a gift bag - I used them to fill a care package.  I prefer buying kiddie toys here as opposed to Toys R Us or Target.

In a pinch, I came here because my ABS light was on.  I was heading up north and wanted to make sure everything was functioning properly so I wouldn't have any problems on my trip.  I dropped off my car at 2:00 p.m. and told them I was bringing it in because of my ABS light.   They said they would call me when they figured out the problem.  Luckily, there are some shops close by so I just walked around and waited.  By 4:45 p.m. I hadn't heard back from them but they had told me they closed at 5:30 so I walked back.   As I approached the business I could see that my car was already done.  I walked inside and got my wallet out to pay and the guy told me there was no charge because they couldn't figure out what was wrong with my car.  I told him the ABS light was on, that's why I brought it in to them.  He said "Oh, yeah, but we'd have to run a diagnostic test to figure out why that's on and we don't have enough time for that because we are about to close."  I couldn't believe what I was hearing; I knew they'd never pull a stunt like this with a man.  It got ugly after that, I'm not proud of the way I behaved, spitting may have been involved.  One star is way too kind, I wish there was a blacklist option.

This hospital is surprisingly not bad at all for being in the projects.  The states best orthopedic surgeon operates here so they must be doing something right.  Doctors and nurses are great - never a problem and always readily available.  The rooms are clean and recently updated - one bed per room which is always nice. The cafeteria could use a face lift.

I've been here twice.  The first time they offered me a really good deal on a detail and I jumped on it.  The end result was mediocre.  There's a difference between detailing and elbow grease...I didn't really get either.  I came back a second time because I hadn't yet formed an opinion on whether or not I liked them.  I think I ordered the VIP wash or something like that.  The guy working there told me my headlights needed to be cleaned and he could do it for $50, I started to speak and he abruptly cut me off and said "we'll talk shop later" he continued to tell me that I couldn't purchase the cleaning kit for the head lamps for less than $20 so he would give me the deal for $20.  I told him that was a BS deal because you can get more than one cleaning out of a kit.  He raised his voice at me and told me that I didn't know what I was talking about.  Amused, I told him there's a crackhead by my cousin's house that will do each headlight for $2 and I asked him if he could beat that offer.  Not amused, he continued to yell at me and told me again that I didn't know what I was talking about and that no one else can offer me the real deal.  Usually, being yelled at by a man will make me go ape sh*t on a mofo.  However, I could tell that this small, puny, sorry excuse for a man was pathetic enough without getting verbally assaulted by me first thing in the morning.  I just laughed it off and took my business to FRANCIS & SONS CAR WASH.

I'm starting to like this Dillard's more and more.  Nice staff, great designers, very clean, it's a great place to shop.  No one ever shops here, you can always get front row parking and the shoe department kept me occupied for an hour.  Both Dillard's and Macy's at San Tan mall seem to be mini-version department stores.  Macy's use to be my go to place but Dillard's is really growing on me.

Hopefully you never have to go through the difficult process of getting someone petitioned for court ordered medical care.  But if you do, you'll have to start here and the incredible staff makes the process easier.  The staff gives the most helpful information and instructions on how to keep checking back.  The facility isn't that clean however, it's an in and out process. Plus, Pomo Pizzeria is just a few blocks away so you can wash the experience down with a Peroni and super delicious pizza.

I was expecting this shop would get rundown over time because of the location but the outside and inside is still just as clean and orderly as when it opened.  This is the only shop of this kind I would go to on the west side.  The prices are lower than Castle or Fascinations.  Although the Fascinations Superstore on Elliott has a much larger selection, I'm confident you can still find everything you need (or didn't know you need) at Secrets.

I was dreading going into this location because I thought it was inside of the hospital and I would be there forever waiting to get tested.  It was a little hard to find but it's in one of the complexes behind the hospital.  Luckily, I was in and out in no time.  The staff was super friendly.  I came in for a pre-employment drug screening and cracked jokes with the lab tech.  Good times.

My new pizza place!  The pizza here is pretty dang good. So are the wings!  The owner is great and it's obvious he takes pride in his business.  He's always close by the register and greets us patrons by our first name.   I haven't eaten inside because I order Togo but it looks like your typical pizza parlor, it's not fancy but it is very clean.

Finally!  I've found a place to buy quality bras.    Nothing makes me more irate than when I shell out $50 for a bra at VS and the under wire pokes out a month later.  I don't have that issue with Soma's bras though, they make them strong enough for a man but ph balanced for a woman.... er... something like that.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it's the best at what it is - greasy pizza at a low, low price.  I usually just get the 18 inch cheese but we've ordered subs, calzones and wings, and they were all tasty and well worth the price.  The only thing I'd steer clear of is the fried zucchini, it's a no go.

Once you've had a Sonoran Dog from El Guero Canelo in Tucson, you'll do anything to recreate the experience.  I've been looking for a good Sonoran Dog since I moved back to Phoenix 10 years ago and I came to La Pasadita in my quest.  Their Sonoran Dog was just okay, the wiener was small and overcooked.  The star of the show is definitely the creamy corn cocktail.  The service is outstanding, they make you feel their gratitude for your business.

This hotel is absolutely beautiful.  I didn't get to spend much time here as I was only in Vegas for 18 hours but when I come back I will be staying here again.  To be completely honest, I can't really remember much but I do recall the gorgeous chandelier when you walk in.  Also, when I woke up I remember the pillows and sheets being super comfy and soft.  The room was very nice, I'm certain of it.

It's been a while since I took part in the nightlife in Scottsdale, it's not my scene but I was invited to White House for a party so you know how that goes.  I arrived at 10:30 on a Saturday night.  The crowd was sparse but I didn't care because that meant that I would get my drinks quickly.  The d√©cor was minimal, everything was white and it seemed very well lit for a nightclub... less chances of ending your night with coyote ugly at this establishment.   There wasn't a cover charge and the drinks were... well I can't say if they were pricey because they were being paid for, but I can attest to their deliciousness.   I never had to wait in line for the bathrooms which were seemingly clean and also provided a bathroom attendant to hand you a towel... no toiletries though.  The staff was great, really cute bartenders that like to flirt.  The DJ was also a charmer and introduced himself to me.  He was playing a so/so music which basically consisted of top 40.  I can't really blame him though, I think it's a pretty common recipe to try to get people on the floor, which, by the way, was lifeless at this point but that didn't stop me, I grabbed a friend and danced the night away.  I would definitely recommend this place to any other Scottsdale skeptics.

I like these smaller Harkins because the parking lot and lines are easier to deal with.  The service here is always friendly and if it's busy, they will open more concession stands to accommodate everyone.  On multiple occasions they've given me the fresh hot popcorn that's falling out of popper, I love it!  Now I want to go watch a movie!

From October to April, the drive-in is the business.  Not only is it dirt cheap but you get to bring in your own food, booze, blankets and anything else your vehicle can carry.  Plus you get to watch two movies for the price of one, cha-ching!  The lines for the concession stand can get out of control so get there early or be prepared to miss some of the movie.  This has got to be one of my favorite things to do in the valley because we can all pile in the bed of my pick-up under a bunch of blankets and watch the latest flick on a huge screen.  Even though it's in a really sketchy area, I've never encountered or seen any type of violence or inappropriate behavior, just an occasional whiff of sweet stinky reefer.

Everyone that likes to eat candy should come here at least once in their life.  It's so much fun coming in here. They have a ton of candy from your childhood that you didn't think existed anymore.    On my last visit I got to meet the owner who was very friendly.  He was giving me this cautionary look as he rang up all of my candy, finally I said "don't worry, it's for a pi√±ata" and he told me to brace myself when he gave me the total.  Ha! He was great! He also informed me that they are one of the largest jelly belly sellers and they were awarded a rare huge jelly belly which hangs in the corner.

My last doctor was great and I loved her but I moved to the East Valley and had to establish a new doc closer to home.  I came to see Dr. Czerkes for a checkup and I couldn't have picked a better doctor.  He has a great bedside manner and his nurse, Maria, was friendly and makes a great first impression as far as the medical staff is concerned.     Nothing bad to report with this office, everything was clean, everyone was friendly, I'll be back next year!

My parents told me about this place and I really wanted to love it because they do, they met the owners and had a fabulous time there.  I wish I could say the same.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and asked the bartender not to put Tabasco sauce in it but she didn't really acknowledge me.  So when my drink came and it was too hot to drink, I reminded her that I had asked for it without the Tabasco.  She informed me that its not made with Tabasco, it a special blend of habenaros and other spices.  Okay, it's my fault for not specifying that I don't like my Bloodys spicy.  Whatever.  I ask her to take it back and another woman, presumably the manager, tells her to tone it down with orange juice.  So she gives me the bloody back, with OJ and asks me if I like it, I said yes because I'm a push over and I didn't want to send the drink back again.  Seriously though, it tasted like something my friends and I concocted in 5th grade from everything in my parents liquor cabinet - the worst beverage, something you'd drink as a dare.    The food wasn't much better.  The potatoes were cold, not just room temperature but literally cold.  I really want this place to make it, it has a lot of potential and I love supporting local businesses.  I hope they get their act together.

I really like how clean and friendly it is at the Smashburger.  I didn't care much for the burger itself but the fixings were good.  Shoestring fries aren't my favorite either, it's like you have to eat a mouth full to taste some potato, gimmie some big ol steak fries!  I had a really great conversation with one of my professors here so that made my meal stellar!

Is it just me or is the VIP room sexy as hell?  I love this place.  This Mamacita can hit pins, let me tell ya.  I love bowling but bowling alleys can be so disappointing.  Not this place.  I had one of the best times ever at this alley.  The service was great, everyone was helpful and attentive.  Drinks were concocted to perfection.  The music was great - we were dancing around, good times.  I can't wait to go back!

Movie night and Barro's go hand in hand at my house.  It's a much better option to the three evils - Papa Johns, Domino's and Pizza Hut.  Great service, fast delivery, good pizza, delicious wings AND they give you plenty of ranch without asking you to pay extra.  I wish they would change their specials once in a while though.

I'm in love, where have you been all my life?  No wonder you're called Charming Charlie's...you've charmed the pants right off this girl.  Since I've found this amazing, wondrous place I've been in there at least once a week, I can't get enough.  I don't have enough time in my schedule to allow me to stay at this place for as long as I need to be there.  I have never walked out of here empty handed and it's a great place to purchase a gift for any female.   Each room has a themed color full of accessories including bags, shoes, watches, jewelry, dresses and tops.  The jewelry is more unique then the stuff you'll find at For Love 21.  Super cute sandals for summertime, I've already bought 3 pairs from here.    If you need me I'll be here.

If you want Italian and you live in Glendale, this is your best bet.  The only thing I've had to eat here is the lobster ravioli and it's just so good that I can't stray and try anything else.  I wish I could eat here weekly but my waistline wouldn't agree.  They make this awesome butter to go along with the bread, it's so yum.  You should check this place out, trust me.

My mom and I came in here for some drinks and we shared a plate of mussels.  The mussels were delicious, great sauce, served with jalapeno toast. Acoustic guitar added some nice little ambience to our mother daughter time.  It's a nice spot for a low key evening.

This is the best buffet I've ever been to in Phoenix.  The food was delicious, hot and fresh - row after row of tasty selections.  Items like sushi, hand rolls, crab legs, stuffed oysters and the SHRIMP!  Shrimp for days, shrimp every way you could want it and some ways you didn't even know about.  The service was prompt and friendly.  I didn't look around at the d√©cor because I was too entranced by all of the delicious food.

I guess this place banks on selling booze to 21 year olds who are just out to get drunk and get laid so they put no attention into anything else besides meathead bouncers and drink specials that taste like candy.  The service was absolutely terrible, it can't even be called service, it should be called going into battle.  The music selection sucked, it was dark but you could still tell that everything was filthy, it's the perfect place to film a snuff film.

I found this little hot spot on Yelp and used my phone to navigate me there; I wouldn't have found it otherwise.  This small establishment is hidden in a neighborhood right off of Historic Downtown Chandler.  It's a quaint little diner with modest d√©cor.  I felt very comfortable there and the service was fast and friendly.  As I looked over the menu the first thing I saw was the Morning Monte and havarti cheese as one of the ingredients.  Cheddar isn't better; it's all about havarti folks!  I needn't look further; I knew that's what I was having.  Hawaiian bread French toast, bacon, turkey, egg and the havarti - absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to come back and bring everyone I know.

Very clean, I like clean.    I was afraid of ordering the big burger because I thought it would be something out of man vs food.  I went with the small burger and it didn't disappoint.  The guys I went to lunch with all got the big burger and I have to say, I couldn't tell the difference.  So don't let it scare you like it did me.  All in all it was a very tasty, greasy burger.  Medium fries are more than enough.  I don't particularly care for fries with skin still on though. I liked that they gave you peanuts to snack on while you wait because the wait was a little longer than I would have expected for fast food.

I mainly come to Sprouts for wine and brie.  They sell president brie they cut in wedges from a larger round.  The flavor is so much better than the smaller rounds or wedges that you can buy prepackaged.  The staff is friendly.  I've noticed they have a nice selection of organic meats but they're pricey.  The produce is fresh but a little cheaper elsewhere so I don't buy large quantities here.  Nah, when I come into Sprouts it's for a bottle of cab, a wedge of herb brie and a piece of fruit... dinner is served.

This is a maaaan's world -- in my best James Brown impression.  This is also a man's bar, I think the term "sausage-fest" was coined here.  This is an awesome cigar bar with some tasty beverages.  I tried the Macallan 25 here and fell in love, we're getting married next week.  I'm not going to give you too many details because I want you to go there yourself to check it out.  My only gripe about this place is that they have two unisex restrooms.  There is no need for this, it's a small enough place where there isn't a stampede of men running to the restroom together.  C'mon, give the ladies their own loo.  Also, toilet seat covers are a must!

I came here because I saw pictures of sushi on the Yelp app that made my mouth water.  Unfortunately, I didn't get any of those pieces but what I had was okay.  The quail eggs were delicious.    The bartender here is phenomenal!  Cute little Asian packed with personality. She made me promise to come every Thursday for ladies night.  If you're a female in the area on a Thursday, go there!  She will take care of you!

The trick is to arrive early.  If you get here past 10 am, it's like waiting in line for Space Mountain.  I'm so glad I did not wait in line because the food was pretty disappointing.  I sampled quite a few different items from the buffet and the only thing I finished was a small tomato salad.  Everything else tasted old, I know it's a buffet but still, I've had delicious buffet food so I know it's possible.  The service was great but the d√©cor could have been more Wicked.  The best part was that they serve bottomless bloody Mary's, champagne or mimosas for two hours after purchase.

Came in for lunch on a Saturday and it was busy but not packed.  The d√©cor is quite lovely, very bright and crisp, it reminded me of all the little white buildings in Greece.  The service was totally on point and everyone that came to our table was friendly and accommodating.  The lunch menu allows you to pick an appetizer, an entr√©e and a desert so I chose a crab cake, lavraki and Greek yogurt.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The entire dining experience was wonderful and left nothing to be desired.

The spam musubi is the best thing on the menu as far as I'm concerned - I haven't tried much else on the menu because I can't stray away from it.  Two pieces come as an appetizer but it's filling enough to eat as an entire meal, which I do.  The small place is always clean, service is fast, prices are cheap.  Not bad for being the only place around to find some Hawaiian(ish) food.

I had a difficult time selecting a spa to go to in Vegas, there are so many options.  I finally settled on the spa in the hotel we were staying at because a lot of spa's I looked at required that you be a hotel guest.  From what I saw online, the Sahra didn't look very lux but more natural and that was a little disappointing, however the reviews all raved about the services.  That summed up my experience as well.  I had a hydra-facial with an add on peel and it was marvelous from start to end.  The treatment room was tranquil and calming, I wanted to stay there all day, no all month, I never wanted to leave.  My esthetician did a wonderful job and she was so sweet.  After my facial, I sat in the lounge and waited for my mom while I drank some delicious infused water.  Once she finished her treatment, we toured the facilities to see what else was available to us and it was pretty disappointing - a large indoor Jacuzzi and a steam room.  We were planning on making a day out of it, I thought we'd do some yoga, lie by the pool and maybe get a salad for lunch but there was no pool, fitness room or dining options.  I highly recommend this spa for a facial but not a spa day.

I'm not even going to pretend to be a cheese steak connoisseur; I've probably had 3 in my whole life.  So no, I don't know what they're supposed to taste like but I had one here and the meat tasted like it had been chewed up already, it was a horrible texture, almost like ground beef.     Let me back up... when I went inside to order the food the three high school girls working the counter were in deep conversation and I had to wait until they were done to order.  I ordered the two sandwiches, fries to split and a soda.  When I got home there were no freaking fries!    Hopefully the other things on the menu are better because I hate seeing small businesses fail.    My one star is for the diet coke.

I'm teetering between 3 and 4 stars. In fact, I wish we were using Star Search scoring because I'd give 3 and 3 quarters stars.   Really cool decor. Like a retro, train station kinda feel. There were these ginormous beehive lamp shade light fixtures that weren't cohesive and I wish they'd take them out because they were an eyesore as well. The restrooms were splendid, very clean, nice large stalls. Aside from the snooty hostesses, the service was splendid.   My girlfriend and I came during restaurant week. It was packed when we arrived at 8:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night, I would recommend rezzies. For starters my friend had the soup and I had the cheese plate, both were delish. The cheese plate came with the cutest, tiny spoons and jars for jam and mustard... took everything I had to not put them in my purse. I can't remember what my main dish was called but it was two pieces of fried fish with a crab cake in the middle, topped with gravy and capers and a side of steamed spinach. It tasted like really good cafeteria food, nothing to write about here. For dessert I had the blueberry something or other. It tasted exactly like a pretzel torte I use to make in my early 20's, tasty but again, nothing to write home about.   I will becoming back for sure. I know they're has to be more to that kitchen that what I was served, I just know it!

Great beer paired with a delicious burger and served up by friendly staff.  Double IPA on tap, awe hell yes.  The burgers did not disappoint, great options to build your own burger or mac n cheese.  The server and bartender won me over though, great attitudes and fun to chat with.

This is the worst car wash I've ever been to!  The first time I went I hated myself for tipping the car washers after I drove off and realized what a crappy job they did.  I paid for the VIP wash and ended up getting the half assed wash.  The dashboard hadn't been wiped down, I could see a large area of dust that could have easily been cleaned with one wipe.  The outside of the car still had dirty areas on the doors and back of the car.   I'm crazy about having a clean car and this place is really convenient so I actually came back a second time.  It was worse!  Again, I paid for the VIP wash and you couldn't even tell the carpets had been vacuumed.  The exterior looked as good as it does when you go through a Circle K car wash.  Ugh, this place will never get another dime from me.

What can I say, it's the DMV. It's dirty, it's gross, the chairs are too close together and the rows all face each other so you have to stare the the people in front of you and then look away really quickly when they look at you, it's so awkward and uncomfortable. They laugh in the face of customer service and helpful information can be found more readily in the bathroom walls than from one of the people working the windows. The woman I spoke with gave me a phone number to call when I had a question about my registration for my vehicle. I tried to explain to her that she worked for the DMV, the end all be all of anything related to driving your vehicle. At this point she busted out her pencil and circled the number for me and told me to call it...thanks lady!

Yeah, I know 5 stars is a lot for a dive with dj but I always have the BEST time here and that's why I'm giving up all the stars.  The drinks are cheap and you are never without a dance partner at this place.  The music ranges from oldies, to top 40, to cumbias.  I once met a lady here that's lost 70 lbs by just going there to dance!

I never find myself dinning in this neck of the woods but I wanted to meet a girlfriend for lunch and she works at the juvenile court nearby.  Our options looked bleak until I hopped onto my Yelp app and found this gem.    I was taken back by how clean and shiny everything was.  The display of pan dulce, agua frescas and ice creams made my mouth water when I walked inside.   Tortas Paquime is great for a quick bite.  I had the paquitostitos and my friend had taquitos - yummy snacks on the menu.    Service was fast and friendly.

I can't believe I'm a native and I've never kayaked in Tempe Town Lake.  Put this on your "to do" list if you haven't already done it already, it a great way to get some exercise and take in some fresh air at the same time.  I came here on a date who received major bonus points for being creative.  We kayaked, watched the sunset and then had a little picnic at the Tempe Beach Park.    It's nice to see that they are open until 8 pm because that would be more doable during summer months, I can't imagine being on a lake that is too dirty to jump in when it's super hot but lucky we were there on a perfect Arizona day.  It would be even better if they were open a little earlier so you could hit the lake around 5:00 am and still have the rest of your day.      The kayak was clean, the service was friendly and considering this is a low-cost and unique thing to do in Phoenix, I've gotta give up 5 stars.

When I lived on the West side, I was here every Sunday washing the whip.  The attendants are super friendly and always spray down my front end and tires. With each car wash, they give you a cloth and a air freshener but I don't like the smell so I refuse the air freshener and they give me two cloths instead.

I really wanted to like Coach & Willies, it's nice inside.  The service was terrible - good looking gals with bad attitudes that move like molasses in winter, bleh.   The food?  I had a loca burger and it came with this thick layer of cheese on top of it that my steak knife could not penetrate.  The fries were shoestring fries that had been cooked way too long and were pointless to eat.  I boxed it up and then carelessly left it in my car for two days.

This place is a great addition to the little restaurants in Sheridan square.  I can't say much for the interior, I'm not a fan of exposing the bare bones of a building and calling it "d√©cor."  However, I still found it comfortable inside.  I ordered a Stella (on tap) and a margherita pizza.  The pizza was good.  I found the dough comparable to Red Devil, although, still not as good.  The sauce reminded me of this delicious spaghetti sauce that my mom learned how to make when she lived in Italy.  She uses grape tomatoes and that's what this sauce tasted like, I enjoyed it, I thought it added a nice flavor to the pizza.  By definition, a margherita pizza should have garlic, this one didn't have any.  The basil had been chopped up and again, the pizza typically calls for whole pieces.  All in all, I'd give the pie 3 stars.  I'm kicking in an extra star for the amazing service from Rizzo the bartender, he made my day.

This was where I spent every weekend this semester to study.  I love this library, the view from the large windows is better than the view from my other favorite library, Burton Barr.  Nice large tables, plenty of outlets to keep electronics charged, clean bathrooms.  My only complaint is that they don't do a very good job of monitoring the noise level in the library area.  I understand that some people out there don't have a clue about what's going on around them and allow their kids to play hide and seek and throw temper tantrums outside of the children's section but the librarians need to regulate.   I still have to give it 5 stars though because it's so tranquil to me... when the screaming kids are gone.

These meals are so huge.  I come here for lunch but the menu items I want are too big to eat for a lunchtime meal.  I usually just settle on a salad which are very delicious and tasty but they are completely devoid of any of the healthy reasons that you'd get a salad to begin with.  So I leave feeling guilty for the calories and bummed I didn't just get the Zany Ziti, Big Ol Ravioli or the Penne Pasta Bake.    Great service, always very quick during the lunch hour, clean establishment, the ambiance isn't as nice as the one in Gilbert but it's still a nice place to eat.

I demand that all Forever 21's immediately transform into huge superstores like this one. I have so much fun in here. I can spend hours looking for clothes and trying things on and then narrowing my picks once it comes time to pay. I love how they have different rooms that separate the style. Granted, F 21's clothes aren't made to stand the test of time but their apparel is priced accordingly. I've never left without buying a couple of things.

I had a delicious cappuccino here.  It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was a lot better than Starbucks.  The service was slow but it was a busy Friday morning so maybe that's why.

I hopped on my Yelp app looking for a place nearby my work where I could grab a quick sandwich and I found the Sub Factory.  As I pulled into the parking spot, I noticed the Bagel Man right next door with a Boars Head sign in the window.  No contest.  I love Boars Head so I decided to go there instead.  From the outside, it doesn't look like much, it doesn't look like much from the inside either - small and no attention to the d√©cor at all.  An incredibly friendly gentleman greeted me and he could immediately tell it was my first time there.  I told him I wanted a turkey sandwich with mozzarella and while trying to decide on what type of bread I wanted, he suggested I eat it on a bagel, he said that I can't find bagels like that anywhere else and promised me that this wouldn't be my last visit to his bagel shop.  I found him irresistible, it may have been the accent combined with the fact that I had just returned home from NYC where these little bagel shops owned by foreigners are in abundance.  Since it was late in the day, already past 2:00 by the time I was able to break away from work, the bagel options were slim so I settled on a salt bagel which I had never had before.  When I got back to my office and started eating my sandwich I realized that he was right, the bagel was delicious and he made a patron out of me.  I've been back four times and I get the same amazing service each time and I haven't veered from the salt bagel yet, it's so delicious.  When my dad wanted to meet me for breakfast we met here and he thought it was a great little bagel shop, too.  Next time there is a morning meeting at work, we're ordering from this place, forget Einstein's!

Excellent Food!  I followed Yelp reviews here and I was not disappointed.  I just discovered Fu Fu this week and I've been there twice already.  The first time I came for lunch on a break from school I had the Yassa Chicken - chicken cooked in a mustard and peanut butter sauce with onions, peppers and green olives. When the plate arrives the color of the sauce looks questionable but the first bite puts me totally at ease.   The chicken was tender and delicious but the sauce was like nothing I ever had, so unique.  The service was great, a beautiful African women and she was such a sweetheart.    I came back a second time and brought my cousin with me, I could tell she wasn't stoked about trying African food.  I desperately wanted to try some of the items on the drink menu, I got a island fruity and my cuz got a mudslide.  My drink came out first in a huge fish bowl glass, it was just as good as I hoped it would be, full of liquor and fruitiness.  The server explained that the mudslide would take a while because the ice cream was rock hard - it did take a while, maybe 15 minutes?  My cousin started getting antsy and I felt bad because she was my guest.  Soon enough the drink comes out and it's a hit, she loves it and all is good.  The food also takes a while to come out both times I've eaten there but it's okay because I can tell that it's been cooked just for me.  Even though I wanted to try everything on the menu, I went back for the Yassa chicken and it may have been better the second time around, I can't tell.  My cousin got the jerk steak and couldn't stop saying how good it was the entire time she was eating.   When the meal was over, I asked her what she would rate her experience and she said 5 stars.  I reminded her that she had to wait so long for her drink and she thought about it and said it was worth the wait.  So five stars from both of us.

This park use to have a ton of peacocks roaming around.  It's so sad to see them gone.  The grounds are maintained pretty well.  I love how large the park is, there is plenty of space to spread out and play Frisbee, or what have you.  They also have sand volleyball, dog park, soccer fields and baseball fields.  The bbq area is set up perfectly for large parties, I've been to a few here and it's always a great time.

I wouldn't typically review a place like Starbucks and I'm a little embarrassed to admit I pay almost $7 bucks for a beverage that doesn't have booze.  However, I had the best drink here and they deserve all my stars.  I get a hot, venti, chai tea latte, soy milk and 1 to 3 shots of espresso -- depending on my mood.  That's been my drink for the past 8 years and I had the best one EVER at this Starbucks recently.  It was so delish I slurped it down in under 20 minutes.

Melissa is a Starbucker after my own heart.  On a hellish day that required 3 espresso shots I met Melissa.  She schooled me on how to order my drink so that it would be a dollar cheaper and also told me that if I paid with a Starbucks card that I would eventually earn my way to free soy milk.  You rock sistah!

Shopping around TMP made me thirsty for a cocktail.  There is some type of Cantina I passed by that did not look relaxing so I went to my Yelp app to see what else was around when I saw the Thirsty Lion.  I was expecting an English pub-like atmosphere and I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in and saw the clean and modern decor.  I sat at the bar, a great thing about this place is that it has HH on the weekends!  The bartender wasn't that great.  He just threw down a drink coaster and walked off.... uh... really?  When he came back around I ordered a specialty drink - mint and cucumber cooler or something like that - I was hoping for more cucumber than mint but the mint was overwhelming, it tasted more like a mint julep.  They did have a great selection of beers on tap but I really wanted a cocktail so the next round was a jack and coke.    I wasn't planning to eat but I noticed some hard-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage on the HH menu, I had to try those, it's not often that I see something unique on a menu.  They were pretty good actually.  I can't wait to come back.

I think it's awesome that Vintage 95 only serves beers from Arizona breweries - way to support the local team!  When I found this place on my Yelp app, I naturally assumed I'd be getting some wine but I couldn't resist trying the Epicenter from San Tan Brewery, holy mackerel - is this a delicious beer!   To eat - I had the Warm Brie with apricot, hummus, grilled flat bred.  It was an appetizer but it was the perfect size for a quick lunch time bite.  I can't wait to go back and try some other menu items and hopefully try some wines as well  This beautiful gem has my full endorsement and I'll be bringing everyone I know here, well... the well-behaved ones anyway.

On my recent stay in Glendale I found this lovely wine bar.  It's a cozy little place that doesn't seat many people.  The whole place is so unlike the rest of downtown Glendale that you feel like you're somewhere else while you're inside drinking.    Nice selection of wine.  I settled on glass of chianti but they had plenty of other reds to choose from.

I came by with my family at the request of an 11 year old boy who was excited to see what Hooters was all about.  When we asked for a table they hostess/server took a glance behind her and said they were all full.  I could see that they were busy but there were several empty tables, they were just dirty.  I asked her if we could sit outside and she pointed us to a table and handed us some menus.  After we cracked open the menu a man (manager maybe) came over to us and told us that our table was needed and we'd have to move.  The server/hostess was still out there and watching the situation.  I asked her where else we could sit and she shrugged her shoulders and said "I'm sorry, we have no more tables."  If this were any other restaurant, I would expect a little more foresight from the restaurants employee like, "it will be a 15 minute wait to seat you" or "just a moment while I clear off a table for you" but it's Hooters.  Since we were asked to leave our table with no other options presented to us, we left but I was super happy that it turned out to be a win-win!  The 11 year old got an eyeful AND firsthand experience on what happens when you pick the pretty girls with big boobs and little clothes - you end up with nothing more than wasted time.

I can't get enough of these workout clothes - I could live in the Wunder Unders.  What's nice about these clothes is that they are built with the shape of a woman in mind.  You won't have to pull and tug at your clothes while in the gym to hide the muffin tops, these clothes do that for you and they stay put.  Their sports bras are reason alone for me to shop here - great support without giving me a uniboob look.      The staff at this location is friendly.  The store is immaculate.  The clothing is pricey side but if you find yourself spending a lot of time in workout clothes, they are well worth the dollah.

I noticed this place open up around the holidays.  It seemed to be dead whenever I passed it so I wanted to stop by and give them my business.   Plus, they have a %15 off sign up and that sold me getting a mani/pedi.  The decor is great, everything is clean and there's a beautiful water feature when you walk in.  Picking out nail polish was the best part of the entire experience, lots of wonderful colors and a large variety.  Even though they didn't seem to be busy, I sat and waited for about 15 minutes to be called back - most places will give you a pedi chair right away.  After I was called back I waited a total of 45 minutes soaking in the chair.  At first, I didn't mind because I was really into my book but then two ladies sitting next to me were sick of waiting so they got up and left and it made me aware of the time.  A woman on the other side of me started flipping out because a dead bug was on her foot so I started to get antsy and contemplated leaving.  Then, I realized that my water had gone cold and it was making the rest of me cold so I took that as my cue to leave.  I shoved my cold, wet feet back into my shoes and walked out.  I did get an apology as I was leaving though.

Ahhh The Little Woody, a fabulous name for a fabulous bar.  This small place is packed with a bunch of alluring qualities - great selection of beer on tap, really good looking people slinging drinks, game room, clean restrooms, dark sunken in booths perfect for getting lost in conversation with someone.  I love this bar and you will too.

I've been driving by this place for months waiting for it to open.  I'm so happy it's finally here.    It's just as awesome as all the other Postino's.  Bruschetta boards, awesome.  Wine, awesome. Ambiance, awesome.    Liberty Market and the Farmhouse are both hot spots across the street so parking will be tricky around there.  I'm not looking forward to fighting the crowds - which are inevitable but worth it!

I love how convenient this trail is to access.  I feel like it's one of the best kept secrets because the parking lot always has ample spaces, unlike Camelback down the road.  Although the trails aren't as challenging as Camelback, there are some steep hills you can charge a few times to get in extra cardio.

D'lish stands by its name.  These little sandwiches are packed with so many ingredients that make them delicious.  I love the fact that they have a drive though and their lattes are better than Starbucks.   I've been to both locations and I always get super friendly service.  This place is perfect for a quick bite.

I'm always looking for recipes that contain ricotta so I totally lucked out when I came across Crudo because so many of their dishes have ricotta.  I had an excellent meal here.  The cocktail menu did not disappoint.  Super friendly service and lovely decor. I can't wait to go back this place is 5 stars all around.

The best happy hour in downtown Phoenix.  The cocktails are delicious, the staff is eye candy, the crowd is... a little stuck up at times but that's their problem, not mine.  My Friday night's usually start here and end at Hanny's for dinner and that is the recipe for a perfect end to a work week.

Thanks Yelp for helping me find another home run!    One gentleman's cut & one crew cut for $23, great price!  These were by far the best haircuts that I've paid for in a while, perfectly clean and neat, no crooked lines.  One of the best parts is that the barber shop is located right off the 10 and it makes it so convenient to get in and out for an excellent cut.  Another great feature is the fooseball table, we could have played all day.  I won't go anywhere else now.    A word to the wise: cash only

FYI: this place delivers to the JW Marriott at Desert Ridge.    I haven't heard a lot of great things about this place and when I saw the reviews I was skeptical about ordering a pizza from here but after a long day in the lazy river, we wanted pizza so I threw caution in the wind and I'm glad I did.  The delivery was quick, even though it was a busy Friday night.  We ordered a cheese and a Hawaiian - both were absolutely delicious.  My dad even hopped over to our room after his fancy meal at the hotel restaurant and enjoyed a slice.  He pointed out that this pizza is made on a hearth, I can't think of how that's possible but I had fun trying to visualize it in my semi sober state of mind.  I'd like to visit the place and see it for myself sometime.

Great new addition to Gilbert.  I came in on a Wednesday night and there was live music, the patio was packed - large crowd for a Wednesday night.  I can tell this place is going to be a hit.  As soon as I walked in, I could smell freshly stained wood, it gave me the feeling that someone put a lot of hard work into building this place - unique and not prefabricated like most restaurants in Gilbert.  Good selection of beers on Tap, I had a Stella.  For apps, we split some ricotta balls.  They were delicious - breaded and fried to perfection and topped with a little marinara.  For dinner, I ordered the chicken caprese with fresh veggies and mashed potatoes.  I was a little disappointed.  I love caprese and make it at home often -  slices of tomatoes, basil and mozzarella - it's a great combo.  I expected the dish to have more caprese but it was basically chicken topped with a slice of mozzarella, two slices of tomato and a little basil.  Both the chicken and veggies were lacking in flavor.  The mashed potatoes however, were the best I've ever had in my life.  I want more!  I can't wait to go back and try some more items on the menu.... or maybe just get a big bowl of mashed potatoes.    The service was good.  Ambiance was very nice.  Restrooms were clean.  Although, they had a sign that said "Let us know if the restrooms need attention"  and I didn't like it, I'm not an employee, if you want me to keep you posted on stuff going on in your restaurant, give me a free beer or something.  Otherwise, make sure the staff knows to scan the restroom once an hour.  Also, this is a great place for a large party of people.  There was a separate room off to the back that would make for a great rehearsal dinner or retirement party.

This is an adorable little place with the worlds friendliest people working there.  I dropped by for lunch and ordered the salad.  Their menu changes daily but this particular salad was packed with a hodgepodge of ingredients - bell peppers, tangelos, green and red olives, jalapenos, carrots, all on a lovely bed of mixed greens.  I had the blood orange and ginger dressing which was an absolute delight for the taste buds.  I quickly googled a recipe to try and recreate the dressing at home.  To drink I had a blueberry tea which was delicious.

My first experience here was less than stellar but my love for beer is so deep that I'd sell my grandma to a sex trafficking ring for a growler of high gravity beer.  Denying myself some beer from the nitro taps at Angels has been agony so I came back in against my best judgement.  I sat at the bar for a while before the bartender acknowledged me, no biggie, I was narrowing down my selection anyway.  I started to become annoyed though when he kept pouring tasters to the people next to me without even acknowledging me.  Finally, I get my taste of the beer I want to try and it's this little tiny pour that couldn't fill a thimble much less my mouth.  I thought to myself "is this really happening, why is this guy being such a d!ck to me."  I looked over at my neighbors taste glasses and he was pouring them half way. I tell myself to let it go, it's only a taste, just get your beer and move on.  But I couldn't get my beer, no. I had to sit there and listen to the customer next to me tell the bartender about all the beers in Germany she has tried. When that long winded b!tch took a breath I stole my chance to order a beer. He looked at me very annoyed and nodded his head and continued his conversation.  Then he continues to pour more tasters for the people he is having a conversation with.  Did you get that?  A paying customer tried to order a beer and instead he poured his friends more freebies.  I walked out.  When I was leaving I saw a gentleman that looked like he was important, I asked him if he was in charge and he said he was. I informed him his bartender was a d!ck to me and he apologized for him.    Thank you for that apology, good sir.  You have a really great establishment and I want your product but their are barriers keeping me from getting it. Please get rid of your staff, hire people who know about customer service and let me tweak the decor to make it more comfortable.  Do that and you'll have a loyal customer for life.

If you are involved in any kind of sports in Gilbert, chances are you've been to these fields - they have softball, baseball, soccer and football fields. This field is called the New McQueen Park and there is one directly behind it called McQueen Park which also has fields for softball and baseball.  I often make a mistake and drive to the wrong field so you should know exactly where you're going beforehand.  These grounds are beautifully kept, very nice and clean, the grass is green and the sidewalks are swept.  I love coming here and spending time outside while cheering on my favorite players.

I first came here on a referral from my PCP for some questionable skin spots.  I became a regular because of the esthetician.  I wanted to give up going to salons for skin treatments because I had heard of a few horror stories so I was in search of a med spa, luckily Arizona Dermatology has an esthetician on staff.  This location is convenient for me, the pricing is reasonable, the staff is friendly and the office is clean.  No complaints = 5 stars!

You have to read the story on the wall.  I read the story while I waited for my zook and it made me enjoy my meal so much more.  I dunno, it really touched me, like I still think about the story weeks later.    Zookz are unique and unlike anything I've ever tasted, they're delicious though.  The strip mall is currently under construction so it wasn't easy to find but it was well worth the search!

I'd give them ten stars if I could.  I just had a really great experience here.  I arrived 30 minutes early on accident and they took me back right away.  The manager at the front desk (Jessica?) was very warm and welcoming.  As long as she was around, there wasn't a dry mouth in the house, she kept everyone's beverage full and the store immaculate.    Brittany hooked up my do, I'm positive that I would not have had such a great experience had it not been for her.  She was a total sweetheart and kept me informed step by step on what she was doing to my hair and gave me tips on how to do it myself.  She handed me a look book with about 8 different hairstyles and had me pick one.  Even though I got the "belle" she still incorporated a "mai tai" and the "cosmopolitan" into my do.  The end result was a gorgeous bounty of curls.  I'm not going to lie, I rocked that hairdo all weekend.

The bartender here was super nice and funny.  He gave me great service and kept checking in on me, he was super friendly.  For lunch I ordered a salmon sandwich.  It was kind of weird because the salmon was fat and round, like a ball.  So you can imagine how awkward it would be to eat a ball in the middle of two slices of bread.  It was good, I love salmon, I just think they could have chose a thinner cut.  They had an excellent selection of craft beers and I think I may have over heard the bartender saying at least one was a nitro beer, oh yum.    I've been back several times with friends and the servers are hit or miss.  The selection of beer is excellent though.

Oh my gosh this place is so ridiculously delicious.  A co-worker introduced me to this place and now we eat here about once a week, it's so good that we need a weekly fix.  The ordering set up is just like Chipotle, pick how you want it served then rice, meat, veggies, sauce - all the ingredients taste fresh and it's packed with spices and flavor.  I usually stick to a pita with gyro meat and load up on the nice selection of grilled veggies.  I've never had a bad experience here but we brought along another co-worker once and she hated the food and only took a few bites.  If you don't stray from typical American food you're probably not going to like this place.

I'd take my chances with a witch doctor before I came back here.    The P.A. here gave me a prescription for the wrong dosage but I didn't find that out until I already paid $200 for the Rx and later followed up with my PCP (because the meds weren't working) and she said that the dosage for this particular medication starts at 100 mg, I was given 25 mg and that's too low to be effective for anyone. Also, there's absolutely no reason to do the online check-in, the receptionist admitted that to me.  When I arrived there were three people ahead of me and I waited two hours.

Biscuits and sausage gravy.  So.  Freaking.  Yum.  I've been here twice and the service isn't that great which is surprising because these seem like career servers.  But the restaurant is clean and the biscuits and gravy are the second best I've ever had in my life.

What a great neighborhood hangout!  I'm so glad I found Bourbon Street.  I have an affinity towards all things Louisiana, especially NOLA.  I'm always in search of a good shrimp Po Boy and theirs was absolutely delicious, they use a good quality shrimp and it makes a big difference.    I was determined to have a few cocktails and the bartender did right by me.  He was fast, friendly and did a great job of keeping everyone's drinks bottomless.  They also have $1 jello shots which were hard to resist so I had a few.  The bar was clean and so were the restrooms.  A few of the chairs could stand to be recovered but other than that, I have no complaints.    While I sat there I talked to a few of the regulars and everyone was super friendly.  After I had been there I while, I realized that one of the people sitting at the bar was the owner and I was shocked, he was really nice and down to Earth and even paid his own tab.  We only found out he was the owner because we were commenting on this really awesome lion head that hangs over the bar and he gave us the background story.  I've worked in plenty of bars in college.  It's always easy to spot the owner because he's a giant asshole to his staff, never leaves his spot, orders the most expensive things on the menu and doesn't pay or tip - but this guy was the total opposite.  I really hope this place makes it!

The BBQ here is delicious!  The dishes are a little on the spicy side so check with the server if you prefer something mild.  You can't go wrong with any of the cocktails on the menu either.  Great ambience, I'm sure you'll have an excellent time if you pick this place for your next meal out.

It is so much fun for me to come in here.  There is this Charles Pollock table that I enjoy bidding on.  The seller never accepts my low offer but I'm wearing on him, I think.  In reality, the only thing I've purchased here were some utility shelves.  Other than that nothing has tempted me to bid.  Oh yeah, you have to bid on everything.  None of the items have price tags, just a six digit number that you have to look up the price on a computer and then bid.  I wish they'd just write down the prices on the tags because fo realz yo, I had to memorize a bunch of six digit numbers one day.  Gimmie a break already.  Still, I like to come in here and meander.

What a lovely bar!  I love all the decor and the attention to detail, beautiful floral arrangements, comfy seating, bartenders are friendly, its very inviting.   We came in on a Thursday night ready to dance but it was country night so we finished our drinks and left.  While we were there the owner, Stacy came around and introduced himself, he seemed very nice and it's obvious he cares about his bar.    Wednesday's sound like the best night to come.  Great drink specials and top 40 music.  We'll be back!

The pizza here is phenomenal.  The best margherita pizza in Phoenix.  I came in on a lunch break during the week and sat at the bar.  I'm not exaggerating when I say I sat there for over 10 minutes before anyone approached me.  I was quite disconsolate when I walked in and didn't feel like talking to anyone so I felt content to just sit there and watch the female (only) staff of servers walk back and forth in front of me- trying not to make eye contact because then they'd have to take my order.  As I watched them interact together, I realized that none of them liked each other.  In fact, it was like watching a commercial for the Bad Girls reality TV show but this was more entertaining.  Finally, a chef approached the bar to make himself a drink of water, feeling rather thirsty I said "hey, do you mind if I get one of those, too?"  He was more than happy to make me one and asked me what I would like to eat and I told him I wanted a margherita pizza.  Within literally minutes my hot and fresh pizza was out.  The Chefs name was Mateo and he was freaking awesome. The owner also came by and made sure I had everything I needed including a nice tall Peroni to go with my delicious pie.  I can't wait to come back in and get served by the guys while I watch the waitresses claw each others eyes out.  Dinner and a show.

The designated parking for this restaurant is an absolute nightmare.  It's a small lot with pot holes and loose gravel, an obstacle course for anyone wearing heels - you've been warned.  Loved the d√©cor both outside and inside, very relaxing.  I ordered the Raw Vegetable salad and added some shrimp.  Everything was delicious except for the cherry tomatoes, they were not fresh and didn't taste good but that was the only item my fork dodged.  They have a nice selection of teas and I settled on the black peach tea and it was very tasty however it is not allowed to cool after brewing so it melted all of my ice immediately.

If you're visiting you should know the inmates booking number and the only things you can bring with you are a key and an ID.  Also, visiting is over a black and white monitor and phone, no more in person visits.  The ideal candidate for a job with the jail is highly insecure.  The MSCO remedies this insecurity by giving them a badge on their uniform and control over a small population of people who have already been stripped of any rights or privileges- basically powerless.  When you give sad people like that any kind of power, they automatically abuse it because they don't get any respect in their pathetic real lives.  Unfortunately, when you visit someone in jail, you have to interact with these mental midgets.  I've been here to visit someone and they didn't know if they could accept a passport as acceptable identification.  A group of them had to huddle together and weigh in on it before they decided a government issued identification was acceptable.  Another time I came, they said they couldn't let me in because they couldn't find me in their "system" which I thought was a good thing.  Most recently though, the Chaplin made a special arrangement for me to see my brother in person when our father passed away.  I didn't ask, he offered.  On my way to the jail I prepared myself for some type of hullabaloo with the dum dums running the visitors station.  Sure enough, as soon as I told them the Chaplin sent me they informed me that the Chaplin doesn't run the Maricopa county sheriffs office.  I reminded him that I never suggested anything as ridiculous as the Chaplin running the sheriffs office but merely that he called me and told me to come see my brother.  After about 20 minutes of talking as slow as possible to 5 different detention officers, I gave up and walked out. It's like they all share one brain and the brain calls in sick all the time.

I'm not a fan of the gym, not because I don't like physical activity but because I prefer to do it either outdoors or in a semi-competitive setting.  I'm sorry but riding the elliptical for 30 minutes then, messing around with the weights for another 30 seems dull as shit. I wasn't finding anything in my area that piqued my interest by means of exercise and this gym is close to home so I stopped by to check it out.  I was mainly concerned with the fitness classes they offered and if the times would fit in to my schedule.  My second concern was contract, the word makes me cringe, I hate commitments.  Luckily, no contract, an even $20 per month and $10 extra for unlimited childcare - I was in baby.  I've been to every class the gym has to offer (except water aerobics) and I love it all.  The instructors are awesome and strive to make the class a challenge for all fitness levels.  The locker rooms are super clean, well the women's anyway.  My 2 year old boy loves going to the childcare and talks about his "teacher" even when we are at home.   The only downside is they have an in-house "doctor" that is there with the premise of getting you healthy, when really he's trying to sling HCG for $500.

The Outback Golf Academy is at Western Skies Golf Club.  The academy offers amazing services for women who are wanting to learn how to play or getting back into the game.  Craig Hocknell is an awesome coach and helps his players build confidence.    I was the only girl on my high school golf team and held my own from the ladies tee's but side from hitting balls at the range here and there, I hadn't played a game in about 8 years.  I found myself with some free time this summer and decided to work on my game.  This academy was absolutely perfect!  The prices were very reasonable and they put together many events (incl. ladies only events) that make it so easy to keep playing and practicing.    The course is nice and so is the rest of the staff here.  You're not going to get any judgement from people because you're not Paula Creamer.  I highly recommend this to all golfers but especially women.  "Links and Drinks" is a great way to work on your game, have some cocktails and make some new friends!

The bartender I had here was pretty dang cool.  It's so nice to talk to a female who knows about beer.  I sat at the bar and chatted with her and another server that was doing silverware at the bar, they were so friendly.  I can't remember what I had but I know it was delicious and that I should go back for more especially because it was so reasonably priced. The decor is pretty cool. Small and laid back.  Great addition to the downtown good scene!

I was here on opening day and these people worked magic that day.  They were giving away free donuts and drinks and everyone in the entire state showed up to get theirs.  The staff stayed calm and kept handing out donuts.    The donuts are good...but a few months later, the staff still seems to be struggling to get it together.

Within the restaurants of a 5 mile radius from where I work, Detriot Coney is one of the most delicious, cheapest and offers the best service.  I went there for a dog but I saw someone eating a juicy burger so I changed my mind.  Drink, fries and a delicious cheeseburger for all under $8 bucks.  The person who took my order explained that my burger order number will be called out and then they will ask me what fixings I want "like subway" he said.  I thought that was a pretty cool feature and they had a nice selection of burger toppings.  The guy who cooked my burger, served it to me at my table and then cleaned up my table when I was done, what a superstar employee.  I'm giving this place 5 stars because it was clean, the service was awesome and the food was very delicious.  For a hot dog stand this place is a cut above the rest!

No one likes going to emissions but this place isn't bad.  I've never had to wait long here.  The staff and service is great for an emissions center.  There's a third party DMV right next door so you can get your tags when you're done here!  The location is tucked away on the side street so it can be hard to find.

Since Huss Brewery is in a business complex, it makes me jealous of the people that work nearby.  I'd love to grab a beer here everyday after work! I'm currently submitting resumes to the businesses in the same complex as Huss.  So far, no one wants to hire a booze connoisseur with an affinity for online shopping during work hours but hey, when this girl dreams, she dreams big.   The beer selection was excellent and I'm excited to try the Huss beers when they come out which I hear is in the next month.  This place has free wifi and the perfect set up to get work done over some delicious beers or even a study group...if you can still focus after a few high gravity beers.  Congrats Jeff & Leah!

This is a really beautiful park with the perfect blend of amenities.  There are tons of BBQ grills - some under ramadas, some under shaded trees with large grassy areas to spread out.  They have playgrounds, sand volleyball, softball fields, dog park, soccer fields and the coolest part is that it's rich with Arizona history back to the 1800's.   I've been coming here as a child, my 7th birthday party was here and I've been to a lot of family members party's at this park, it's always a great time.

I hired Mariachi Rubor to play at my fathers funeral and they brought down the house.  I can't imagine having gone with anyone else aside from them.  They are very talented in both song and instrument.  I felt that their service was reasonably priced and would recommend them to anyone looking for mariachis.

I can't possibly say one bad thing about this place.  This bar attracts the friendliest group of people, I never leave without making a new friend.  Excellent selection of beers.  If beer isn't your thing, the owner/bartender is very knowledgeable on the wines he carries and can help you find something perfect for you.  I could sit here for hours and drink and play Cards Against Humanity all day long, if only it were open all day but it doesn't open until 3:00 pm.

The La Santisima Quesa is absolutely delicious!  I crave it all the time.  Order it, you won't be disappointed.    In my opinion, this is the best restaurant within a 10 mile radius of downtown Glendale. It has the best margaritas, tacos, salsa bar and service.  I tipped off my buddy Jason V. to this place and now he's the duke.  It's goooooood.

I really don't understand how Glendale Glitters has such low ratings.  Let's dispense with the ridiculous expectations and accept it for what it is - a free viewing of Christmas lights.  I'm grateful to the City of Glendale for taking the time to put up all these lights and incurring the electric expense at no cost to me.  I think the lights are beautiful, it's nice to walk around and feel the spirit of the season.  During the weekends they usually have carriage rides and other vendors selling food and light up toys.  Or sometimes it's a huge event with live music, a bunch of kiddie rides and hot air balloons.  Regardless of what is going on, it's still free, you don't have to pay for anything.

I was shopping up a storm one day and I needed to wet my whistle but I didn't want a soda so I came to Salsita's for a fresca pina colada.  I'm so addicted to these drinks now.  I will drive 15 miles out of my way to get one.  I've tried to get my fix at other Salsita's but this place must have a secret recipe because I'm telling you kids, its freaking delicious!  I've actually never eaten here so I can't vouch for the food - just that pina colada.

Oh Uber, I do love you and like a good lover, I will shower you with compliments.  Thank you for keeping me safe from DUI's.  Thank you for notifying me when I left my keys in one of your cars.  I love how you let me view your driver en route to come and get me so I know if I have a chance to order another beer or not.  You calculate my tips for me so I don't go overboard and tip 100% like you know I sometimes do when I'm drunk and love everyone in abundance.  Fuck Discount Cab and their ugly green cars, fuck Lyft and their pink mustaches, I only have eyes for you.

Hands down the best muthafuckin bar in Phoenix!  All around five stars!  Service, food, cleanliness, decor, COCKTAILS... the cocktails are phenomenal.  I've been here twice already in the one week I've known of its existence - both times were a great experience.  The menu is obviously well thought out and the cocktail descriptions make is so difficult to settle on just one... so you can't... you have to settle on at least five and then call Uber to come get you.    I love the bartender/owner!  He is so genuinely grateful for the customers that come to his place.  He also has an awesome Scottish accent and it doesn't matter what is coming out of his mouth, it just sounds awesome.  Seems to me this guy could have opened up shop anywhere but he chose Phoenix and I thank him for that, we were in desperate need of a place like this.

My coworkers and I came in here for lunch on the week it opened and we were all so happy to add this place to our lunch routine.   Our burgers were fresh and juicy patties and the fries were hot and seasoned perfectly.  Unfortunately, that was the last time we had a good experience.  On multiple occasions, we've been served fries that were so over seasoned that we had to spit them out.  Burgers are carelessly thrown together and falling apart. That freshness we once tasted was replaced with old wilted lettuce and cold meat grease.  Like crackheads, we were chasing that first experience but we just ended up throwing money at food too gross to swallow.  It's a great menu but really poor execution.

We came in an hour and a half before they closed for dinner and the hostess was in complete disbelief that we had shown up without reservations even though no one else was waiting for a table.  She was clearly put out by our shortsightedness and behaved like she would have to go chop wood to get us a table.  Once we were able to be seated, we walked inside the dining room and there were open tables everywhere.  We asked for one of the open tables overlooking the strip because it was my birthday and it would add to the occasion.  We were told those tables were all reserved but they were still empty when we left.  Instead we were sat in an awkward hallway.  Our server wasn't kind or attentive in any way.  I asked for a lobster roll and he said that item was no longer on the menu but the next closest thing were the pork sliders.  I failed to see the similarity so I ordered a margherita pizza instead.  My mom ordered an appetizer for us to share and a salad.  The cheese she selected for an appetizer came as a single wedge of cheese on a plate at the same time as our entrees.  It was weird, usually cheese is served paired with something but it was just a wedge by itself.  We both agreed that our entrees were delicious but we couldn't tackle that big chunk of strong cheese on its own so we asked for something to go with it but our server never brought anything.  As we sat and waited, my mom noticed that the table next to us was eating a lobster roll, you know - the ones our server told me were no longer on the menu.  Also, their server was continuously filling their ice tea while my mom's glass sat empty at the edge of the table throughout our entire meal, it was never refilled once.  We actually had a lovely time because we were enjoying each other's company but it was hard to ignore the terrible service we were receiving.  As we were leaving, the hostesses just watched us walk out, no "thank you for coming" or "have a nice day."  They were the most miserable looking women I've ever seen in Vegas.

Very friendly service, delicious food, welcoming environment. I haven't found a Mother Bunch Brew that I've been a fan of but I'll keep coming back until I find one.  In the meantime, they have a large selection of beers on taps that is sure to please anyone.

Love, love, love Elizabeth and her crew!  It's really difficult to find a barbershop that gives consistently good cuts but these folks are true professionals.  Liz is awesome and has even offered to stay open after hours to accommodate me!

I saw Whitney Cummings here and it's a pretty comfortable theater.  The acoustics are good and the rows are set up so that you're not looking directly at the back of someone's head all night.

First off, I love dive bars but this place is ten degrees below being a dive bar, it's absolutely disgusting.  It's brightly lit which is a damn good thing because the cockroaches would be more ballsy than they already are and just walk up and steal your drink out of your hand.  All of the seats are torn so don't wear shorts or the seats will poke your skin and you expose yourself to contracting disease.  Even beer goggles couldn't fix this place, it's sobering.

Downtown Glendale is in desperate need of more places like Cuff where you can get a delicious meal and cocktail in a welcoming and clean environment.  I can rave about the filet mignon I had the first time I came and then I brought a friend back and we shared some deviled eggs.  Everything I've eaten has been absolutely delicious.  Their cocktail menu is short but has everything you need - very tasty whiskey drinks.  The establishment is clean, the decor is casual and the seating is comfy, its the kind of place that you'd want to stay a while and lose track of time over great food and drinks with friends.  So why only 4 stars?  I've been three times and the staff is consistently aloof and working on their disappearing act.  They don't appear to have any career servers, but young people who may be on their first job, which is totally fine but they aren't supervised or given direction.  I think I pinpointed the manager because I hear her ask the staff to do things for her but it's obvious that she's a fish out of water and she usually has a scowl on her face.  I really hope they can get some good help because Cuff is 5 stars in everything else.

Came here for a late lunch with my mom and grandma (who are the cutest lil women you'll ever know) and the food was absolutely delicious!  I ordered the seared tuna salad and it was like a party in my mouth, so many flavors.  My mom and grandma shared the grilled cheese sliders.  I tried to get them to venture out but these weren't just any grilled cheese so they were utterly pleased with their selection.  The service was just okay.  I really enjoyed the d√©cor and the open seating but we sat in metal chairs that make it uncomfortable.  I looked at everyone sitting in cushioned seats with chair envy.

My buddy and I came here for drinks and we were both under the impression that it was just a bar but they also serve food.  He and I sat at a table for 15 minutes chatting until we finally decided that the server wasn't going to help us so we walked to the bar to order our drinks.  The entire layout of the bar was awkward.  It's divided by pool tables and TVS and the bar is off in the corner so you're either encroaching on the patrons sitting at a table or the patrons sitting at the bar, it was uncomfortable.  Even though the place wasn't busy at all we still had to wait on the bartender because he was shooting the shit with the server.  I think a friendly acknowledgement from an employee after being there for 20 minutes would have went a long way.  We finally got our drinks and walked back to our table leaving a trail of spilled tequila shots and beer because the bartender filled them to the brim.  We finished our drinks and the server never came by to see if we wanted more so we left.  I won't be back.

Thank GOD Johnny's picked up where Lobby's left off, it would have been a shame for the world to miss out such tasty eats.  Whenever I suggest a good burger joint to my mom, she one of her criteria is that the patty be seasoned which is commonly overlooked.  Well Johnny's cooks their burgers to perfection, seasoning included.  The fries are also crisp, hot and delicious.  Prices are reasonable and the shop is immaculate (restroom included).

I should have come here a lot sooner. The beer is delicious.  I had a 24k IPA and was pleasantly surprised.  I was not expecting such good beer from a small local brewery.  The staff was absolutely phenomenal, very friendly and inviting.  Kyle took us around the brewery which is tiny and then downstairs to the Goldmine- a small tasting room.  It has these large concrete tunnels that used to serve as a gun range, just a super cool place to chill with some beers but it's only open for special events.  I will most definitely be back!

The food taste like Pei Wei but Flo's doesn't make you stand in line to order which I appreciate.  My girlfriend and I came here for lunch and it was packed but the service was lightning fast.  I must say I was pretty impressed with how efficiently the staff works together to serve the customers and quickly turn over tables.  I had chicken curry and the sauce was delicious, the chicken was tender and the veggies were crisp.  I'll be back for sure!

I've heard a lot of really good things about this place but every time I come by, it's always too packed to try.  My co-worker and I noticed the drive-thru line only had 2 cars during lunch rush so we jumped at the chance to check it out.  To my amazement they had someone outside taking orders, at noon, in the hottest state in the country during the hottest month of the year with no shade.  After we turned the corner we saw a second person standing next to the menu and speaker box collecting money, again no shade or water in sight.  I was completely appalled by Portillo's inhumane treatment of their staff.  I wouldn't treat a dog like this and especially not an employee providing a service for me.  I understand that there are jobs which require individuals to work outside under the extreme conditions of an Arizona summer but the drive-thru line of a fast food restaurant isn't one of them.  So what if your customers have to sit and wait in their air conditioned car a few minutes longer for their fast food, it's no excuse to make two human beings stand outside in 110 degree heat when you have a functioning speaker box and two windows to pass money and food.  As for the food, my co-worker enjoyed his dog but my burger was in styrofoam which is well known to trap moisture so my bun was soggy and my burger fell apart.

I really wanted to like this place. The menu is mouthwatering, decisions are not easily made.  I've been here twice and the food just wasn't good at all.  One time, the hash browns were under  cooked and still hard.  The other time, the food was cold, like literally cold, there's no way it was prepared for me.  My michelada was delicious and the service was okay but not enough to bring me back.

Mycenary on tap, yeah e yeah!   I've been here quite a few times and I can vouch for the wings, salmon salad, and marg pizza...not necessarily all in the same visit though.    Solid selection of beers and liquors. Free games so you can stay awhile. Maybe my favorite Desert Rose spot, I dunno but I dig it.

Alright people of Glendale, we finally have a place that is locally owned, servers delicious food and has the best selection of beers and liquor!  I have two words for you: Angels Envy.  This is the best bourbon you're ever going to taste and Desert Rose carries it!  They actually have a pretty nice selection of whiskey, it could almost be called a whiskey bar.  The steakhouse is a part of a few other restaurants that are pulling off the same concept as the Yard.  There's a huge patio with the same kind of games and lounging areas like the Yard.  However, DesertRose has a cigar bar which neither of the yards can claim.  If you need me, I'll be at my new favorite hangout!

You can't beat a $3 wash!  I'm a regular at these self-serve car washes and this one is the best because they offer compressed air to blow water out of the nooks and crannys around my SUV.  They also have dual vacuums for both sides of your vehicle where in other car washes, you kinda have to steal your neighbors to do the passenger side.  I did notice that the air fresheners and cleaning supplies that were sold in the vending machine were priced $.50 higher than the other places that I've frequented.  I guess that compressed air isn't gonna pay for itself ;)
