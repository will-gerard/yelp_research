This is my parent's Mexican restaurant of choice. I can see why. The portions are huge and everything is hot, fresh and tasty.   Husband and I shared the crab and shrimp enchiladas, although it was a tough decision to make. Everything looked tempting. The enchiladas were quite good and definitely big enough to share. We both have big appetites but had taken advantage of the chips and salsa and ordered a quest dip for the table. The queso was rich and cheesey, served with flour tortilla chips - although I preferred the corn chips and used those to dip.   If in the area again I would like to try the pollo rico - I have a serious weakness for jalapeno cream cheese.

I visited the Swizzle Stick this past Saturday with my buddy Kevin O. and his wife. I had fond memories of this place from about a decade ago when it was located a few shops down. My memory stood true as we had a great time interacting with the locals, sipping on cheap, strong drinks. As Kevin mentioned in his review, there was a fellow that appeared to be a regular peddling religious propaganda with his cute little dog in tow, however the bartender was quick to curb his preaching and even came to check on us to make sure we weren't uncomfortable. All in all, it is a great value and the people are friendly.

If the delicious pizza and wings aren't enough to bring me back to Luckys over and over again, then the super service is. The guys that work here seem like genuinely friendly people and always greet you with a smile.   The XL pizza and 20 wings special is a steal and feeds the whole family. I love the thin crust on their pizza and the wings are always crispy and meaty.

Im obsessed with this place at the moment. Chicken bacon ranch pizza is amazing. The stuffed style meat pizza is amazing. Their wings and salads are amazing. Customer service is amazing. Stellar choice in an area that is heavily populated with independent pizza joints. My go to place from now on.

Great lunch specials for 5 - 6 bucks. Willing to customize which I love when dieting. I ask for steamed chicken and veggies with no oil.

Still the best vet around town. The staff is attentive and knowledgeable and they will get you in same day even for routine check ups. I do strongly feel that due to the vicinity that they should strongly consider renaming to "Arrowhead Animal Hospital". Works much better for me as I tend to refer to the clinic as "Arrowhead Animal Hospital" already.

I have been avoiding going here because my mom told me she liked it about 8 years ago. My assumption was that if this bar is the type of place my mom digs I will probably not like it. Anywho, after going a long day at work followed by dinner we were looking for something low key to do and decided to give it a shot. It was a Friday night around 8 or 9. Not too many people but not too few to socialize either. We didn't try any food but the drinks were strong and cheap and I recall some decent specials on shots and vodka. The crowd was very friendly and I didn't have a hard time making conversation with regulars. There was a dj in the corner and we did a little dancing and played some pool too. I would for sure go back again.

Souper Salad always leaves you slightly dissatisfied. Not that I believe the competition is much better but there are some definite improvements that could push Souper Salad up a few notches.   1. Clean plates and silverware. - we typically are left sorting through the stack of plates to look for one without cling on leftovers. This goes for silverware as well.  2. More adequate staffing. - Every time we have gone to Souper Salad (which is quite often) we are forced to wait at the register for 2 - 10 minutes while the floor attendant carries drinks to seated patrons and removes dirty trays. There is one lady who has been working here forever with long brown hair. She seems to take on the majority of the workload. This last weekend there was what appeared to be a younger lady manager who seemed very uninterested in assisting at the register or anywhere else for that matter.  3. Bread station refills - The bread is almost always empty or near empty forcing you to watch until bread is set out and then battle the other customers to get a lousy breadstick.  I noticed that Souper Salad recently attempted a minor facelift. While under "construction" the place looked a bit like a crime scene and I half expected a chalk outline on the floor. The big reveal did not do much to make up for the cosmetic disarray. There were maybe a few new pictures added (no more creepy dancing veggies) but I didnt notice many upgrades other than that. Regardless, you get what you pay for and considering you can feed a family of 3 for less than $20 you can't expect 5 star dining, but I won't be giving Souper Salad a 5 star rating either.

Pretty pricey but consistently good food. The breakfasts on Sunday morning are rather nice and they have a clown that offers balloon animals and face painting for the kiddos. Not the same old mexican food that you will get from other area restaurants, Arriba's serves more New Mexican fare than traditional tex-mex.

They have Ace on tap. Thats good enough for me. Fortunately I also dig the food. We usually get the play platter (soft pretzels, wings, mozzerella sticks and onion petals) and the french dips. The bartenders are friendly but it can be difficult to get a waitress's attention - they are busy primping and flirting with the management - so take a seat at the bar if you go.

Everything I have had at Greek Wraps is good. My personal favorite is the chicken shwarma with rice. The restaurant itself is clean and well lit and the staff are friendly. We do eat here but prefer to take food home because it can be somewhat packed in here.

Family and I had breakfast here a week ago. I remembered eating here with my parents when I was just a tot, and thought I would take a trip down memory lane.  My son was happy to see chicken and waffles on the menu and tried that. My husband and I both chose fried eggs, bacon, toast and french fries for our potato choice. We ordered aside of brown gravy to go with the fries. Everything came out quick and hot. We were satisfied with the taste, tge large portions and the value for the price. My son's chicken strips and waffle were really good and my husband and I especially enjoyed the fries and gravy.

MMMMMMM.....chicken wings. These are the best wings in town. Pizza is good too. We go for the 30 cent wing ding night on Monday. Split 30 or 40 wings a couple sodas and leave full for less than $15. The happy hour specials in the bar are pretty kick ass too. Can't beat $1 drafts and free pizza. We have turned all of our friends on to Pullano's (including some of the reviewers here).

I don't know if I am lucky or unfortunate to live so close to this Mixteca. You see, the food is just so good and cheap that it us difficult to use any self restraint. The ambiance is unique and there are regular patio events that look fun too.  Prices are on par with any valley berto's shop. Place your order, grab some chips and salsa from the bar and take a seat. Food is typically served quickly, but I have been in there when there was a crowd and wait times can increase. Worth it though, because the food is plentiful and superior to other area taco shops.

I flippin love Waffle House. Would you believe that in two different cities in Georgia that I lived in there were two waffle houses across the street from each other? Seriously! Like you could go to one Waffle House and look out the window and wave to patrons in the other Waffle House across the street! In at least two cities that I know of! That is because Waffle House is not a restaurant in Georgia - it is a way of life. Like some people are catholic, I worship at the House of Waffle.   I am not sure how they do it but it is like Waffle House breeds their own waitresses. They all look the same, talk the same, have that sassy "I don't care too much bout nothin" attitude. Plus they now have all-you-can-eat everything between 2 and 9pm. So strap on your feed bag and get ready for a load of culture. Just make sure to get your hashbrowns scattered, smothered, chunked, peppered and covered -its divine!

If I could give negative stars I would. This place is horrid. I did have a good meal here - back in '85. When I was 4. When I thought tacky, dusty lighthouse decor was hip. I went back to Taylor's on that single memory and *surprise* they have not changed the decor since then. And I am pretty sure judging by the taste that they have not changed their inventory of seafood since then either. Yes, the food was SO bad that I DO NOT think they have changed the seafood inventory out of their freezer since 1985. You (and your wallet) are better off hitting up the Long John Silver's. You read that right - BETTER OFF AT LONG JOHN SILVER's.

I really like the grilled cheese with the green chilies. Great bar food but you WILL smell like fish fry when you leave so not great for a date night unless you are already in that comfortable stage. Oh and the corned beef is stellar too.

I wanted to take my grandma out for some dinner and since this place is a block or so from her house, we decided to give it a try.   Upon arriving we could tell that it was busy, but there were still empty tables. We waited for 5 to 10 minutes to be seated and then another few for our waitress to take our drink orders (water, nothing from the bar). At this point I should have taken better notice of the patrons around us. Nobody had food in front of them and several tables looked anxious as if they had been waiting for some time. Our waitress returned to take our orders and then we started what would be the longest wait in restaurant history...  We literally waited for 35 minutes from the time we placed our order to the time we received our dinner salads. 'Oh good sign' I thought as we received our salads, thinking dinner couldn't be too far behind... well I was wrong. We sat and sat and sat for another 25 minutes. Eventually I told my hard of hearing grandma that I was going to settle up on our waters and side salads and we would go grab some Arby's. She agreed and I hunted down our waitress. When I told her I wanted to tab out, she looked at me with disbelief and stated she would have to get the manager. Then she proceeded to clean a table. I was disgusted and ready to go. And I would have too, if my sweet little grandma wasn't sitting there. Our waitress returned and asked if we could wait 2 more minutes. I looked around and mentioned there were at least 2 other tables ahead of us. She stated that they ordered pizza and it takes longer than our orders. A few more minutes passed and our plates came out.   The food was nothing fancy, but did taste alright. I had stuffed shells and grandma had manicotti.   Next time I take grandma to dinner we will make the drive to another place and avoid the excessive waits.

Chang Lee deserves some love. I've been coming here with my grandparents since I was a kid. The prices are right, always get a seat, service is great and the quality is consistent. Their style is a bit different than the other area Chinese places. I recommend the egg drop soup, house chicken and spicy shrimp. The location is a bit unlucky as the restaurant has had to deal with construction projects in one shape or another for the past couple years.  Give them a shot! I love it.

Despite living across the street, I have avoided trying New Chen Wok because the reviews since their management change are kind of rough. But tonight I happened to be at Frys and decided to give it a go.  We ordered a large chicken with string beans, a large hot lover's chicken and a wonton egg drop soup. Total came to just over $20. We paid and our to go order came out shortly after.  The hot lovers chicken was like a spicy sweet and sour, but with veggies. The chicken and green beans tasted fresh and had a light sauce. I liked the wontons in the egg drop soup. Everything was hot and not too oily like some local spots.  I'm unclear on how the recent reviews have been so low. Perhaps we caught them on a good night or maybe I'm not as picky as the other reviewers. I will try this place again. It reminded me of the quickie chinese joints i used to frequent around Army bases when I was enlisted.

This KFC is hands down the worst. They never have enough chicken cooked to fill an order without a substantial (25-45 minute) wait which I think is total bull. If you sell chicken you should make enough to fill say....a bucket of chicken. The drivethrough is a joke - it takes forever and you are probably going to drive off with only half your order. Case in point - last month I ordered a 16 piece bucket 'o' chicken for a party. I get home and find that my 16 piece bucket is in fact a 12 piece bucket , the pieces were teensy and there was a random bonus piece of yellow plastic included. So I check my receipt and call the manager to request his assistance on the matter. He tells me that chicken shrinks in the winter which is why my pieces are so small. Now I am no scientist and maybe this is true but it sounds pretty damn stupid to me. He offers me to give me the missing 4 pieces of chicken if I drive back there (keep in mind both Thunderbird and 75th ave are torn up with construction and this is rush hour on a Friday). I told him fine and that I would rather get a refund then the 4 pieces at this point because I was disgusted with his attitude. He states "Ok but you will have to return MY chicken". Seriously? Like I am trying to get one over on KFC after they shortchanged me on my $30 bucket of chicken? OK guy. You can keep your measly chicken - I will go to Fry's.

Man this was my kind of place! Our cab driver told us about this place on the way to a casino. He promised us that the 4 of us could get good and wasted on $40! And he was right!   The place looked a little seedy to some of our group when walking up but we decided it was time for a change from the expensive drinks on the strip. We walked in and the friendly girl bartender started shouting at us to buy some jager shots right off the bat ( I seem to recall them being $2 at the time). We decided to go for some well drinks instead ($1.50). Looking around there were many other great deals - some even came with a hotdog or a bratwurst! The patrons were friendly and upon discovering that we were from AZ immediately wanted to talk us up about the ongoing Jodi Arias trial.   This was a fun place and we will check it out again next time we are in Vegas!

I love El Encanto. We recently took my grandma and my kid for lunch. If you haven't been you should check it out. There is a really cool outside patio area around a large duck/turtle pond which really is the focal feature of the place.   The chips and salsa are award winning and the lunch menu is great and really affordable. I had the mole enchiladas and my husband had the fish tacos. Both were excellent.

I LOVE L&L. The saltiness of the kalua pork against the creaminess of the macaroni salad - it is soooo worth the calories. The BBQ chicken and chicken katsu are my second favorites. I have had other hawaiian BBQ in the area and this is hands down the best around metro Phoenix. The staff are super friendly, the prices are low and the place is always clean.

Best Mexican food in the valley, hands down. Excellent happy hour in the cantina after 3.   I was back about a week ago and noticed that Valle Luna has undergone a slight facelift on the restaurant side. It seems like maybe some of the menu pricing has gone up to compensate for the new decor, but not sure about that. Either way, still great food and worth the price!

Wish I could rate negative stars.... With so many bar choices this place is by far the worst.  Last Saturday a group of friends went out for a friend's birthday celebration in Scottsdale and decided if we split up that we would meet at the end of the night at Loco Patron. It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out. The friend who was celebrating his birthday waited behind at the bar until his friends left the bathroom. At this point two bouncers became extremely agitated at our friend and demanded that he put down his drink and leave. My friend started to explain his reason for not leaving (friends still in bathroom) but was quickly cut off. I watched from the patio as the two bouncers (both obviously larger in height and weight then my friend) quickly escalate from talking to both grabbing my friend under the arms and start to carry him out. As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident.   I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law.

It is difficult to find restaurants that cater to a Paleo diet. Korean BBQ may not be paleo due to the oil but we figured it was close enough for a quick weekend meal. We ordered the pork belly and ribeye which were both delicious. I like to load mine up in lettuce wraps and decorate with the little accompaniments - yum!!! I thought that this place was rather affordable and I will likely try them in the future.

The gym facilties are adequate and very clean and the classes are good. I would give Gold's Gym a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the billing practices.   My husband and I signed up almost 2 years ago and at the time were signed in to a 2 year contract paying around $17 a month as our big corporate discount. Since that time Gold's has offered a $9 month to month membership as long as you don't participate in classes which we don't. I called to see what we would need to do to switch to the reduced program and was told that we would not be able to until our original contract was up and then we would each need to pay $100 to reduce to the lower $9 month to month membership.   As a customer it feels like you are being punished for being loyal and signing up before the other month to month members. It seems to me that if I was willing to sign up for 2 years knowing I would have to pay every month that I was in for the long haul which may not be the case with your newbie month to monther's. I personally do not feel members should be penalized if they signed up before Gold's offered this new membership. I am a good customer and was considering signing up for personal training until I realized this company's billing policies. Now I don't want to hand over another penny over what I am obligated to pay and I will likely move over to YouFit or LA Fitness in the few short months when my contract is up.

Cox has super lousy customer service. From the phone reps to the techs to the supervisors. My appointment today (which was a bogus problem on their end, not mine) was for a 3 -5 pm window. So I worked to fit this time into my schedule and bargained with coworkers to get out of work early. 5:45 comes and nobody shows...So I call Cox. It is now 6:45 and I am still waiting for somebody to take me off hold. Meanwhile I am "live-chatting" with a rep named Maritza R. who cannot tell me if the tech will be arriving and tells me that if they aren't there in the window they wont come. I told her that her customer service is lousy and I would like a manager. She promptly ends the chat. So I start a new chat. I get a fellow named Federico and immediately ask for a manager without disclosing any of the previous information. Funny thing is that after a 5 minute wait "Supervisor Charlie" answers and knows all the details of my chat with Maritza. It is now 7pm. Supervisor Charlie is providing his guarantee that the tech is coming tonight and he has emailed dispatch. So that is where I am now. Putting off my dinner plans in order to accommodate this lengthy window. Not sure if the tech will show...but lets face it. Anybody who has dealt with Cox Customer Service knows that the tech will absolutely not be at my place tonight. Nope I will need to take another day off so that I can have them come out and fix their problem with my internet. Oh and did I mention I take online classes and work from home at night? So no internet = no bueno. Thanks Cox.

I love Sprouts and I feel fortunate to have one so close to my house. The quality and price of the produce make it worth the trip alone. The meat and cheese is fresh and the sausage made in house. The store is well lit and clean. Some of the supplements and health care products are expensive but still a better deal on average then Whole Foods.

I was pretty surprised at how much I liked this place. I have lived in the neighborhood for 5 years or so and never tried them. I am not sure what deterred me other than maybe the name. Ballpark just doesn't instantly trigger thoughts of great pizza for me... I will readily admit I was wrong though!  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and 20 wings. The wings were big and meaty and I thought they had a great flavor. The ranch wasn't my favorite ever, I am guessing it may have not been made in house, but I could be wrong. Ranch aside though these were some damn fine wings IMHO. The pizza came out a few minutes after the wings and I was blown away at how good it was. The crust was thin and crispy, which I absolutely love. My only complaint is that I burnt my mouth because I was not patient enough to wait for it to cool! I know, I know - that isn't Ballpark's fault so I won't dock them any stars. This place is a solid choice for some pizza and wings! I will try them again soon!

I typically do not like shoestring fries but Freddy's are very good. Everything else on the menu is pretty good too. I like that the burgers are not typical of fast food places. The thin patties remind me more of what you get from a diner. Oh and the frozen custard shakes are much better than the ones at Culvers.

Cheap eats in a laid back beachy atmosphere. You can easily feed a family of 3 for less than $20. I'm a big fan of the shrimp tacos and $1 make-your-own bloody mary bar on Sunday mornings. Fun, cheap place to hang out with a group of friends.

Hubby and I were back at Pappadeaux last Monday. Right off the bat I will say that I have never gone to Pappadeaux and not had at least a 15 minute wait. There have been times that I was quoted a 1.5 hour wait. Waiting sucks but the food is worth it. Personally a 45 minute wait is my cut off but if there is a seat at the bar I will get a few drinks while waiting.   We were seated and the waitress explained that she was training so we expected to possibly experience a couple hiccups. We ordered a dozen oysters, fried gator and shared a blackened salmon and salad. Our oysters and gator came out immediately with bread and butter. Everything was excellent. Then we waited for our entree and salad....and waited...and waited. After about 15 to 20 minutes our waitress came by and apologized and let us know that our entree was coming. I tried to play it cool and not act agitated but at this point we knew we would miss the movie that we had planned on seeing after eating. I requested that she bring out our salad while we wait for our entree.   Our waitress arrived 5 minutes later with our entree and salad in hand and once again apologized for the wait. She also explained that our there was an issue with our salmon when the chef split our meal onto two plates and that she would be bringing us out another fillet shortly. BTW, it is nice that it was split for 2 but I would have been equally happy to share from the same plate, however I do see this as an over and above service and appreciate these little efforts. She also offered to bring us a dessert at the end of our meal to make up for the wait and the problem with the salmon. The food was all delicious and as promised the waitress brought out the dessert tray and asked what we would like to try. We went for the creme brulee which did not disappoint. Our check did not include the dessert and we were given half off our oysters. This is why I adore Pappadeaux. If there is a problem they go way beyond to fix it and make it up to you.

For some reason I had some anxiety about going in here for the first time. This was several years ago. I think I was in fear of sticking out like a sore thumb in a place that was outside of my usual wheelwell. Anyway, I am glad I eventually went in. This place is a treasure and I am now a frequent shopper. The seafood is fresh and inexpensive and there are so many items you cannot find at a standard valley grocery store. Sometimes I like to grab some lunch at the little restaurant right inside the door and then maybe a thai tea boba at the little vietnamese sandwich shop and then just wander around the store finding items you never expected to find in Peoria.

I am changing my review to 5 stars. I was back in last night to buy a couple whole rainbow trout to throw on the grill. This place is the best for fresh seafood. I also think it is rad that they offer "courtesy ice" for customers making a long trek to shop at their store.

Happy to have a new Ace right by my home. Staff were super helpful and friendly. The store is well organized and has so many cool things I want to buy!

So good and soooo cheap. I love the turkey pesto or the strawberry cream cheese, but honestly everything is great. My kid orders off the menu...a pb, banana and bacon crepe. Yum!

This is a solid lunch choice. I prefer it to the other area bakery type lunch places. I was in last week and had the chopped salad and a cup of chili. Both were excellent but the salad was top notch. The friendly staff keep the tables bussed and clean. The hazelnut coffee here is very good too.

I don't get the obsession with this place. The tortillas are fresh but other than that everything is literally dripping in grease but not much flavor. Service is also slow considering it is set up as fast food. Plus any place that closes on Sunday gets an automatic loss of a star from me.

I love Dick's! Trevor in the shoe department provided A+++ customer service tonight. We left our house on a mission to buy some new running shoes and after a disappointing experience at a smaller store that advertises their custom shoe fitting we headed to Dick's. I had no idea that they will test arches and gait for a good fitting shoe. Trevor pointed out several great options after asking us a few questions and then let us try on a few pairs. He told us he was 18 and other than his appearance I would have had no idea because he was knowledgeable beyond his years. What a great kid, he is really an asset to that company. Dick's has a great selection and we will be return customers from now on.

I am rating this place a 2 because I have had Mellow Mushroom in Savannah. If I hadn't experienced Savannah's I would possibly rate this location a 3...possibly. The Mellow Mushroom in Savannah is a unique dining experience where as the Mellow Mushroom in Phoenix was just basic eats at a regular ol' run-of-the-mill franchise restaurant.   We had the gourmet white pizza, spinach artichoke dip and a Greek salad. If Applebee's served pizza this is how it would taste - very commercial. Nothing really stood out. Plus they put sun dried tomatoes on everything which just reminds me of the Broodwich.

Man this place was goooood. My husband and I shared the greek fries (he doesn't like feta but scarfed these bad boys down), then shared the Aegan club and Baklava cheesecake. Everything was very good and very filling. I would recommend to anybody that likes Greek food.

Just left this federicos.  I had a Texas burrito and hubby had the Rey burrito. Both were above average, and the restaurant was very clean. No flies on window sills and floor was freshly mopped. Staff were courteous and helpful.  Will come again.

I love Westwind drive-ins. You can pull up in your jammies with kids in tow and not have to worry about them bothering other movie-goers. Great value, excellent popcorn and concessions and good quality digital picture and sound. We literally come here every weekend. It's one of those family traditions I look forward to enjoying for years to come.

I enjoy the chicken at El Pollo Loco. I do not enjoy the wait for the chicken at El Pollo Loco and I was admittedly indifferent to the hair that I found on my chicken at my most recent visit at El Pollo Loco. I had waited for ~ 15 minutes for 3 chicken breasts and a wing (no sides, no drink) so I decided to pull the hair off my chicken, remove the portion of skin that the hair was sitting on and have at it. I will say it was still delicious albeit less than sanitary.

Awesome unique location. Drink special was strong and worth the price and food was good. I had the sriracha ceasar salad and hubby had the honey mustard chicken sandwich. His was nice as was mine but the dressing was a little on the fishy side and not overly sriracha-ey(?) as I would have preferred. Cool change from typical chains.

Great urgent care in Peoria. The PA-C and MD that I have seen here on separate occasions were both more thorough than my primary care physician. The wait to be seen is typically very short and the waiting area is comfortable and clean. The lady in the billing department is very helpful and I feel that the prices are very reasonable for the complete nature of my visits here.

I have only been to Smashburger 3 times now but I am definitely a fan! I like the black bean burger patties and the rosemary and garlic Smashfries. My husband really likes the grilled chicken and my kiddo loves the burgers and fried pickles. Everything here is good and at a reasonable price.

Great mom and pop Hawaiian joint. The people are super awesome and the food is fresh and amazing. We have  used Leos to cater 3 parties so far and it blew the guests away every time. Personally I love the lemon pepper chicken but haven't had anything I didn't like so far.

Yum! Yogurtini is delicious! I like the suggested mixes on the board. I do not like the line of contemplating customers who feel the need to sample every single flavor but that comes with the territory when you frequent yogurt shops. I love the mint flavor with some dark chocolate chips and andes mint bits.

Located in an industrial park off the 101 and I-17, this place is a perfect spot to grab some lunch. My family stopped in shortly before dinner. We were greeted immediately by a happy man who was just as cute as a button and very helpful.  I was impressed with the expansive menu, but nonetheless, went with my standard gyro and Greek salad. Husband had the Italian gyro and son had the standard gyro as well. I was happy with my selection. The meat is sliced very thin and piled high and the bread to tzatziki to meat proportions were perfect in my opinion. My salad was great, and I found myself stealing crispy fries from my son's plate as well.   My 10 year old son did not finish his gyro, but wrapped it up to take home for later. This is rare for him, so he obviously enjoyed it as much as we did.  I will make it back in soon to try the other items on the menu!

The employees were super helpful and friendly at this location inside the Fremont Hotel on Fremont Street. We purchased 3 caramel apples and received the fourth for free! The employee that helped us offered to slice our apple for us so we could snack on it while we walked around Fremont.

I was recently on the opposite side of a home inspection by White Glove. Upon completing his inspection I found that the inspector had knocked over a can of paint hard enough that it slightly opened and spilt. I also found that while in the attic he had applied enough weight over our master bathroom that the drywall split.  The inspection was submitted to the buyer who requested some minor repairs. We quickly arranged the repairs and moved to a rental house. The day after moving there was light rain. When we returned the following day we found that the ceiling in one bedroom was sagging. My husband reached up to touch the drywall and found it was saturated. We pulled down the soaked drywall and looked up to the roof to spot the leak. There was a definite leak around the vent stack.  I had a licensed roofer out the next day who explained that somebody had been recently walking on the tile roof and had cracked the tiles enough that they punctured the roof underlayment. He could tell this by the fresh sediment surrounding the cracked tile. He explained that the rain water was entering through a cracked tile, permeating the underlayment and then entering the attic through the vent stack pipe. We scheduled the repair and decided it was now time to call the owner of White Glove Inspections to discuss their careless conduct. The owner, Steve, asked if he could go inspect the damage. I provided explicit instruction on where the room was that the damage was in. The next day I called Steve to discuss, and this is where my opinion of his company went from bad to worse. He explained he had found what he believed to be sun damaged underlayment. I told him I didn't agree that the damage wasn't caused by his inspector because we have never experienced any leaks in the past, his inspector's review did not list any leaks, and my roofer told me that the roof was in good shape other than the damage by his inspector. I also explained that it was extremely telling that after having no leaks, we have a major leak less than 6 days after his guy was walking on our roof. Steve argued that the roofer was telling me what I wanted to hear and that the insulation in my attic had been wet for months if not years. He didn't realize that I never mentioned the inspector to the roofer. I also explained to Steve that I had installed drywall in the past and I know enough to know that if the insulation was wet we would have water spots at the least and sagging/separation at the worst. This is when Steve became condescending - stating that he didn't realize he was talking to a "drywall professional who had been installing drywall all my life". At this point he decided to tell me that he found "all kinds of damage that his inspector missed, and he knows that makes his company look bad, and now it was up to him to submit a second inspection report to the buyer". I recognized this immediately as a threat. I also knew that the conversation was going nowhere and invited him out to my house to discuss his findings with my roofer as they were completely conflicting. Steve stated "I will make sure to be available to put your roofer in his place" and we ended the call. I waited for Steve to submit a new inspection report to the buyers with newly "found" damages. This never happened. I did notice that Steve had let himself into my house and walked all over the basement and other rooms that were not affected by the roof leak as he left every light on in those areas. Monday morning, Steve showed up to our house to point out the damage to my roofer. My roofer had not arrived yet, so I took this opportunity to ask Steve why he needed to go into my basement seeing as I had not permitted him to do so and it didn't have any impact on the roof. He stated it was a "perk" of the job. I have my own theory that Steve looked around the house for additional items that he could submit to the buyers as leverage over my complaint. I think that Steve realized that his inspector cracked the roof tile, and decided to conduct himself dishonestly to avoid covering any repair expense. I then decided to ask him what additional damage he had submitted to the buyer on the second inspection report. He stated that he had no idea what I was talking about - despite his threat to do so on the phone. He said that he sent pictures of the leak to the buyer - something I had already done. At that point my husband and I pointed out the paint leak and the split drywall seam on the ceiling in the bathroom. He didn't have much to say about either area. I asked him to leave and explained that he could reevaluate the roof leak after my roofer completed the work. In the end, my roofer completed the repair; I paid him $1500 out of my pocket and proceeded to sell the house this past week. Bottom line - I wouldn't pick this company to give me an honest review of a home as they do not conduct themselves with honesty or integrity. There are better companies out there.

Just read the hidden reviews for this company, and I was not surprised based on my terrible experience. What a joke service. And now I am $1600 dollars in the hole for damage they made to my property walking on a tile roof and then breaking it!!! And this damage was confirmed and reported to me by a third party licensed roofing contractor.   Learn from our experiences and stay far away from this group.

Highly impressed with this company.  Long story short, we let a guy live in our carpeted basement with his husky that absolutely destroyed our carpet in the period of 2 months. We thought we were doing our due diligence by spot cleaning after we discovered spots (and kicking the guy out). Well we still could tell the carpets were nasty and decided we would have to pull them out. Had a slight change of heart realizing the cost to refloor 2000+ft and gave Sweettouch a call to see if we could salvage.  Michael came out initially to steamclean. He warned my husband that the treatment may not get through to those heavily saturated spots that went through to subfloor and reviewed options. My husband elected to add on pretreatment. At the time Michael noticed severe buckling in the carpet and mentioned it should be restretched-  a service they offer, but didn't pressure the sale. When I came home from work that night I was impressed with the improvement but did see what Michael meant about restretching. We called him back and set up an appt.  Michael returned to our house to restretch. Again, very quick and professional and we were happy with the service. At that time we decided to set up a 3rd appt to have him back out to do a deep treatment through the pad and to the subfloor to really tackle the urine spots where he flooded the spots with a solution to break up the salts and then used a water claw.   Michael was out again today to finish up our 3rd appt. He did a great job and saved our carpet. It smells great, looks new and we didn't have to spend thousands to replace our basement carpet. We are very happy with the service and the best part is that all 3 times we ended up paying less than what we were quoted.   I am picky and I really don't believe you will find a better service to take care of your floors. We plan on scheduling Sweettouch again to clean our tile and hardwood very soon. You will be pleased with this company.

This place is great for kids and adults alike! I purchased a Groupon for four entries and a $5 gift certificate to get frozen yogurt at the snack bar. My husband and I took our son and his friend for a couple hours and they had a blast.   I will say though that the teenage staff running the place are not great at monitoring the little kids safety but some parents allow their tiny toddlers to mix in with the older kids in the general jumping and dodgeball areas. There is an area that is strictly for the really little kids and the older kids should be able to jump freely without having to watch for the little kids.

Just as delicious as Tandoori II, but way fancier! We went on a Friday night and if we had been blindfolded in the way over I would have sworn we were in Scottsdale. The food was awesome, the building beautiful and the patio with firepits and heaters and hookahs are a great addition to the ambiance. If you have not tried Indian food before, this is the place to do so. The tikka masala and naan and fragrant rice are all great beginner dishes. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the service was pretty damn slow making us miss happy hour specials. I will say though, the belly dancer and music were rad but it made some of our party feel awkward as we didn't know if we were supposed to stop our conversation to watch and tip. All in all, this is a great place.

This is a nice mom and pop type restaurant. We arrived shortly after opening on a Sunday morning and were the only people in the restaurant. The waitress was friendly and offered us suggestions when we asked. We went with a green chili cheese crisp and a chicken chimichanga. Both were very good. I really liked the cheese crisp and that we were asked if we liked it soft or crispy - crispy all the way!  I like the current decor but I think that they could soften some areas by hanging curtains or valances in the doorways or from the ceiling in the back to block the server area. Otherwise everything was very good and I would be happy to try Ayala's again.

My family and I arrived 10 minutes before Snoh opened, but the guys at the counter suggested that we hang out on the couch until they were ready for us. Very cool of them.   This place was rad. I had a thai tea shaved ice with red bean, almond cookie and black sesame glaze. It was amazing. My husband had the strawberry with fresh strawberries on top and condensed milk glaze - also very good. My son had taro with sliced almonds and caramel; again it was delicious and worth the drive from Peoria.

I stayed at the newly renovated D Hotel and Casino this past weekend and I was happy to learn that there were 3 separate eateries open 24 hours. After a day and then a night of drinking our group was looking for a substantial sit down meal and D Grill fit the bill. We arrived around 1a.m. and the restaurant was mostly empty.  From what I do remember (I was pretty inebriated at this point), I was very impressed with the restaurant's decor and ambiance. Our servers were efficient, quick and polite. I felt that the menu was well balanced and that there was a good selection even this late at night. As a matter of fact, the only items that were not available at that time of night were the dinner specialties.   We started with the spinach dip which came with freshly made chips. I also had a french onion soup which was very good. My husband ordered an italian sandwich and fries and he enjoyed that. My brother had a meatball sub and was not able to finish the large portion that he received (he is a big guy too!). My sister in law had hashbrowns, bacon and an english muffin - all standard. I ordered the hudson salad. It was decent, not the best salad I have ever had and I wasn't head over heels for the hudson dressing but it wasn't terrible by any means.   The food was good, the service was exceptional and the new decor is fresh and contemporary. I would dine at the D Grill again if I am ever on Fremont.

I work for the hospital and am fortunate enough to get to eat here every day. The value blows everything else out of the water - including bringing my own lunch. Breakfast usually runs between $1 and $3 and lunch and dinner is typically between $2 and $5 and you can save even more if you ask for a Live Well punch card (free meal after 5 Live Well selections).  There are daily specials and tons of healthy options. I appreciate that the nutritional information is posted for each item so you can make smart decisions. I have worked at several valley hospitals and the food offered at Mayo Clinic is so much healthier and better tasting.

Quicktrip is always my first choice for gas and convenience items. The staff are well trained and the facilities are always spotless. I like that it takes all of 3 seconds to check out and every customer is welcomed when they enter. They have an exceptional assortment of convenience foods from hot dogs to raw almonds. They also carry a great selection of beverages.

I do not understand the great reviews of this place. If your namesake is "Biscuits", maybe you should do those exceptionally well? Or at least modestly well? The biscuits were small, terrible, expensive and slow to arrive. The rest of breakfast wasn't great either. The waitress was clueless to the menu items.

I was surprised to see that this location was not yet on Yelp, however this address is not listed on their website either so maybe it is a separate franchise(?). Anywho, I am giving a 4 out of 5 stars for this type of restaurant, not necessarily a 4 out of 5 for all mexican dining. I like that Juliobertos offers a "light" menu and wheat tortillas although I am not sure just how light these choices are. Also it seems to depend on who you order from but I have noticed that some of the staff do not know what is what when it comes to the menu. I have ordered the grilled chicken burrito off the light menu and received grilled breast one time, grilled thigh another time and shredded chicken one other time. Either way everything typically tastes great, I like that there is a salsa bar inside and the food overall is a great value as is with most 'bertos restaurants. Plus after a late night of drinking who can beat a $5 meal of carne asada fries?!!!

I was really excited to try this place. It smelled unbelievably good in here like really good barbeque or bacon or something like that. It was all we could do to sit patiently while our table was set up.  Unfortunately that is where the visit turned for the worse. Our server seemed like a nice guy but just couldn't get it together. We ordered some beers and it took well over 10 minutes for him to bring our beers and come back for our order. We asked for some recommendations and took him up on the suggestions. He suggested the Justin brussel sprout salad and stated it was his absolute favorite thing on the menu. So I ordered it and it was mediocre at best. My husband ordered the "pho" which he stated was great...it was literally ramen straight out the package with an egg and a couple veggies. My son ordered the kid's burger. It was like a burnt meatball on a dry bun with no toppings whatsoever. My friend ordered the kale salad which she picked at then turned her nose up at. My other friend ordered the fish and chips but would have been better off "trusting the Gordon's fisherman".   All the poor food aside, the server then left us alone without checking on us throughout our meal. When we finished we asked the guy bussing our table to send him back over so we could order another beer. Our server took our order then hung out with the other servers at the bar/register area for 15 minutes. Eventually we decided to ditch this place to find another that would actually bring us our beers. So I walked up to the register and asked him for our checks and told him to make sure he didnt charge us for the beers he never brought us. He brought us our checks a couple minutes later and mumbled "sorry about that"....   We won't be back.  Edited 04/30/13 at 20:10: To address owner Candy's response below. I am not surprised to see that your professionalism suits your establishment. My review was as honest as I could possibly state it. Your "pho" sucked and it was definitely ramen. I cannot tell you how the kale salad tasted because I did not try it, just stating what I observed of it. As for the back-handed insult stating "I am a mother of 3 kids- if I see a burnt meetball (sic) I would certainly not feed to my children- but I am so surprised you let your son eat it." At no point did I state I allowed my kid to eat it. In fact we stopped after we left your restaurant to get him a different dinner. All the food aside, we most likely would have overlooked the crappy food if the service was better and I would have provided more stars here. I am not sure what you intend by inviting me to "call you to contact me with your honesty". Do you want me to call you at this restaurant? You can email me directly with the best contact info if that is your intention.

This place. Seriously. Tried Pho Viet last weekend and oh my god was it good. Ordered eggrolls, rare beef pho and grilled pork bahn mi. Everything was delicious. Like the kind of delicious where you are thinking about it 5 days later.  Restaurant was very clean, server was polite and prices were fair. We will return.

Situated directly inside of my favorite grocery store (Lee Lee's) this place is hands down the best Pho I have had in the area. It is super affordable, around 5 - 6 bucks for a big, yummy, steaming bowl of Pho and about 2 bucks for a couple of the best spring rolls I have ever devoured. The staff here are friendly and fast and I will for sure be a regular!

There have been several other taco shops in this location over the past few years. None have fared well, obviously. We were happy to see that a Senor Taco was now in place and decided to give it a shot. We ordered a couple Diablo shrimp burritos, a quesadilla and a bean burrito. All were very good but the shrimp burritos are very obviously Senor Taco's claim to fame. Worth the trip.
