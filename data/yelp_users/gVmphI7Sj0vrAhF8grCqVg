The girls up at the front and the vet techs were all super friendly and sweet. The vet (never told me his name) was rude and short. He didn't seem like he wanted to be there, barely did an exam on my puppy and talked to me as if I was clueless. I work with dogs professionally and I'm no veterinarian but I'm also not an idiot. I took 1 out of my 4 dogs so I've been around the block. This is the second banfield I've went to and I was quite unimpressed again. The wait time wasn't bad, the facilities were clean and everyone was nice except the vet which is the reason I won't be returning.

I'm the first to admit that I'm pretty picky with my vet for my four dogs. We moved here about a year ago and have been to 5-6 different vets and we have finally found a home in Anasazi! Excellent staff, services, everything!

Our waitress Brandy would be the biggest reason we would come back to this place! She was an awesome server and even more fun to joke around with. Thank you for being a great server Brandy!

Best part about this place is the fact they have no breed restrictions and the fact they're open 24/7. Absolute hugest perk with a pitbull and a crazy schedule. My pup always has fun and I love the fact they post pictures and videos on their Facebook for me to see when I'm at work. Also love the fact they do packages that make it convenient when I'm in a hurry to pick up my dog and dog. 90% of the staff is knowledgable and friendly... The other 10% is inevitable anywhere you go... The biggest downfall is the smell. My dog reeks every time I pick her up from there. I've taken her to 4 other daycares and I didn't feel like I had to bathe her as soon as she got in the car. If they got the smell under control, it would be an easy 5 star rating!

Took my lab/pit mix to get shaved (as I do every summer) and the girl completely butchered it. I did it better myself last summer and I've had no experience in grooming dogs. All the male managers in this store are arrogant. The one young female manager is always sweet and helpful. The young female trainer is very condescending and thinks she knows all. Other than that, typical, average PetSmart.

Absolutely floored by the service we received tonight at this this sonic. We pulled into one of the drive in parking spaces to simply order ice cream and two of them are broken so we then pull into the drive thru. We waited over 20 minutes just to get to the window, as we were the patient customers and watched 5 other cars drive off before even reaching the window. When we get to the window, we are told "I don't know what to tell you" and that our ice cream isn't ready and they don't know when it'll be ready. We then questioned why we would have to pay for waiting so long for ICE CREAM and we were told that we would be stealing if she didn't charge us. This young lady was rude and clearly incompetent and hopefully she finds another job that isn't in the service industry.

Best Dutch Bros location I've been to. Most of the workers know me, my dogs and girlfriend by name as well as our drinks. Very personable and legitimately care about your life and how you're doing. They always take care of us and not to mention, they always have the best coffee! Love you guys!
