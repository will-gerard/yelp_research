Wasn't a great experience. Sat on the patio, service was extremely slow (wasn't busy) and inaccurate. Appetizers (ordered about 5) were underwhelming, amongst other things, calamari was very soggy. Maybe skip this location.

Food was decent (blackened fish sandwhich) but like the other reviewers, service is EXTREMELY slow. It was even difficult to order drinks... They are sorely understaffed. Happy hour prices are decent but I wouldn't come back due to the service.

Still not quite sure what's in the 5 layer brownie, might have something addictive though. I tried one and a half brownies to try to find out. It was a little soft for my taste, but that was easily solved after a few minutes in the freezer.

Absolutely love the street tacos here. Burritos, both ba√±ados and dry, are delicious too. I like the nachos too. Think I'm trying to say that I like everything here. To top it off, the people at Mi Casita are seriously the friendliest restaurant employees ever. I like this place and it likes me.

Khoury's is still the BEST Mediterranean food I have ever had. My sister used to live down the street, and what a find it is. Service is excellent and I do not mind a short wait for delicious food. There is nothing like their homemade pita bread!! I don't know what their fresh, homemade, green spicy paste is called but it is out of this world.  I still tell all my friends to try it when they go to Vegas. My only wish is that it was closer to the strip.

Decent to above average food, and great beers. Comparable to a 4 Peaks in the East Valley. Can get pretty busy but it's worth a wait.

Yeah, it's a $2 car wash. The adage "you get what you pay for" comes to mind. I sat in the car and texted while my dad vacuumed his car, it was pretty easy. Then you drive onto the tracks and 20 seconds later, voila, TWO DOLLAR car wash is done. Not bad for 2 bucks I guess; car left cleaner than it started.

If you like delicious food, then more delicious food packed into convenient burrito packaging, you love Jamburritos. The blackened catfish burrito [and all the catfish] is ridiculously great. 2 grown adults can easily fatface on a single burrito. K-Sadillas are fantastic as well. If you haven't tried this food truck, do not hesitate, the hype is 100% warranted!

Secret is great, particularly if you're staying at or happen to by at Cosmo. It's actually pretty easy to find, just follow your nose on the 3rd level. There's usually quite a line (you're better off calling ahead for a whole pie if you or your group plan on eating over 4 slices). The pricing is pretty aggressive but hey, it's Vegas, you would've spent it on worse things.

Great little place in Gilbert. Had pasole, chorizo breakfast burrito, green chile burrito, and green chile stew. All pretty good! And the staff is really nice!

I have been crossfitting in Phoenix for a few years now and I wanted to try a gym in the East Valley. Dropped in and the people at CrossFit Inernal were very friendly and the owner/coach Bonnie is awesome and very encouraging. I also noticed that her regulars there had great form during kettlebell swings which isn't the case at many gyms. Overall had a great time and I would definitely recommend them when you're in the Chandler/Gilbert area.

Rick did a great job tinting my Lexus GS with 3m crystalline film. His pricing is very competitive and for 7 windows, he was done in about 3-4 hours. He even dropped me off at my office down the street. Great guy to work with, especially if you want 3M crystalline.

Tried a few different Crossfit gyms/boxes around the Scottsdale area and I thought Magna was the best coached and everyone was incredibly nice.  A few of the classes can be geared towards more competitive Crossfitters although there is a wide range of fitness and experience amongst the people there. Brian and Katie are awesome, Ainsley is pretty good too.

This place is ridiculously good. Seriously. In my group, we had spaghetti, pizza, and calzones. The prices are very reasonable as well. My friend said it best when I asked him how his food was; ohmygoditisamazing & idonthavetimeforthespacebarimeatingthistreasure. Suffice to say, I will be back.

Big fan of Habit! Great if you're looking for more options than In-N-Out (such as delicious onion rings). Food always tastes great and the service is excellent. Also an option if you don't plan on drinking and don't want/need the whole sit-down experience

Fired is right down the street from my office and continues off the custom personal pizza concept. The pizzas taste pretty good and their gluten-free pizza crust is more doughy and doesn't have the cardboard consistency that some other places do. The service is always friendly and quick, even during the lunch rush. The reason it's 4 stars for me is because my first exposure to the concept was Pieology (-- BIG fan, their mission statement should be "making fatboy pizza dreams reality").

The luchador theme is awesome. Amongst other things, reminds me of Nacho Libre! The burritos are humongous. I'd compare to a fresher, more homemade Chipotle, which I think is great. A few of the meats are on the saltier side but it isn't too bad. Service is also great, they are extremely friendly and helpful. Will definitely go back to try some other things.

I am typically not the biggest fan of buffets as I think quality tends to take a backseat to gluttonous quantity. Akita is a great exception. The sushi and sashimi taste pretty great, especially for Arizona. And the pricing is very competitive. Lunch is $12!! Hopefully that will discourage people from feeling obligated to gorge. Try it! Service is great too.
