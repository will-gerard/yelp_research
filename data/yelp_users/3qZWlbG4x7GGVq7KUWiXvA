I'm only giving this place two stars because the customer service was great.  Overall the hotel itself is a little outdated.  The TV, phone and clock are up to date but everything else was not.  It's a very clean room, nothing majorly wrong with it.  The downside is that the walls are paper thin.  We were just having a conversation and security knocks on the door telling us to lower the volume.  Lower the volume on what? So if you are a person with a "loud" voice, don't even bother staying here because the next night around 8pm, we get a call.  I didn't even bother answering because I figured it was the asshole racist security guard.  They have pre conceived notions that African Americans can't afford places like this buuuut your the one whose a rent-a-cop! I guess he had to feel big about himself since he might lack in other areas.  I've stayed at the Ritz in downtown LA and that place was top notch, 5 stars compared to this place.  Just because your in the Biltmore area, does not mean you have class. I doubt I'll come back here because I like to have conversations and not remain silent if I'm not under arrest Mr. Rent-A-Cop!

I was helped right away since I had an appointment to get my battery in my iPhone replaced.  I even brought my laptop in because I thought I would be there for a while. Nope.  I was there for about 20-30 minutes.  The customer service was great, the turn around time was even better.

I love scholtzky's but after the experience j just had, I doubt I'll go back to this particular location.  I shoulda known the food was gonna be awful when I saw a huge ass roach on the side of the building.  Yuck.  I get home take a bite out of my sandwich and there was the most disgusting after taste.  I don't know if they didn't change or clean the surface that they cook everything on but my that's my guess.  I wanted to take it back but by the time I would get there they would have been closed.  I plan on letting management know my experience.  It was disappointing because I was really hungry and had to throw everything away.  Totally unacceptable.

I don't know what they put in their food but it's soooo addicting! I order the chow mein and potstickers all the time and it's so good!  I also love that they deliver which makes it easy when I'm really lazy to cook.

I really like this practice.  Dr. Lindsay was very pleasant and honest with me.  My blood pressure was reading higher than it normally has but I have history of high blood pressure on both sides of my family.  I'm extremely active in CrossFit and eat well so she did not jump to the conclusion of putting me on a high amount of medication.  I liked that she wanted to monitor me by putting me on a different diet.  I'm glad that I went with this practice and I plan on making this primary care.

I love this Subway. Everyone is always nice and pleasant, I've been here twice and both times the bread was soft and fresh which most of the time when you go to subway it's stale or just not good at all. I'm glad this location is near my job :)

I used to come to this church consistently but after about 3 sermons that were about the same concept---money,  I had enough.  Once they had a PowerPoint explaining how much you should be giving to "God", I was completely over it.  I shouldn't have to feel guilted into giving money to see blessings, that's not how life works.  They really need to refocus the topics because not everyone is as fortunate to give like they expect you to.

After a fun, alcohol filled night, my friends and cousins decide to hit up LoLo's.  I hadn't been here since they were just a back room to somebody's kitchen so seeing the expansion gave me high hopes because it presented itself nicely...the interior is the ONLY thing that presents itself well.  We walk in and the unenthusiastic hostess asked how many was in our party and I told her 8.  Being that the rest of the party live further, it would take them a while, so she informed us she can't seat half of our party until the full 8 showed up. Ugh yeah, right. I'm hungry and I'm not waiting so we just asked to be seated for our four. So after letting her know it would just be us for, she writes my name and instructs me to "scoot"  to the side and sit down. In slow motion, I turn around and all of the waiting benches are taken soooo where the hell am I suppose to sit, on the older ladies lap that was already sitting there?! She could have easily said "it will just be a few moments, if you'd like you can take a seat that's available behind you". Was that too difficult?! So I say whatever, they sat us within the next two minutes.  Our waiter/manager of the restaurant takes our drink orders and he seemed pretty cool cuz he was joking a lil with us.  So my cousin asks if she can put in an order for someone who was showing up a little later and then that's when things went down hill.  We were informed we couldn't do that because it would be cold by the time he came and blah blah blah.  Brotha, that's another order which results into money into your business' pocket.  So we order our food but he let's us order for our cousin who would show up late.  So we place the order and literally 5 minutes later, a different server comes out and says "UM this is for someone showing up late or somethin".  Ok, so you mean to tell me there was a discussion about this tiny little request in your kitchen amongst several servers.  Not to mention our order hadn't even come out yet, so the "complicated" order was first to come out when our orders were the smallest.  My friend asks why my cousins order came out so fast and why we haven't received ours, so that's when the title of this review comes in "ma'am we cook chicken and waffles all day, some orders will be quicker than others". Huh?! I know I didn't major in computer science but this really wasn't THAT complex.  So luckily my cousin walks in just in time to eat his food so it didn't get cold like Mr. Manager/Waiter/Host/Fry Cook (he seriously wore many hats) mentioned.   I don't wanna come to a place to eat when there's all these rules and instructions beginning with who and how many people can sit with me.  Being a California native, Roscoe's will always be THE Chicken & Waffles place that dominates any other competition.  Compared to Roscoe's, this place is amateur.  At least with Scoes they seat you no matter what time your party arrives, your food comes out within 5-10 minutes from the time you place your order, and you have a server who is just that...a server.  Not the building instructor, valet attendant or whatever our so called 'server' was to us.  This place will never get my business ever again.

This is for Lina...  Lina is the sweetest person you could ever meet and she knows what she's doing and talking about.  I fell in love with her right when I met her because she was so warm and personable.  After the facial my face felt so clean and light.  I'm definitely going back to her in 3 weeks as she recommended.  She's obviously been doing this for a very long time so I trusted her advise and expertise immediately.  You won't regret going to her, she's absolutely amazing!

I'm so glad that I picked this practice.  Not only is it down the street from my job, everyone here is so pleasant.  From the receptionist to the doctor.  I was a little worried after I was sitting in the waiting room for about 5 minutes, about 10-15 people showed up and it looked like all the appointments might have been scheduled around the same time.  Luckily I didn't have to wait too long.  The physician's assistant was so sweet and personable.  The doctor was straight to the point and perscribed me topical medications immediately, she wasted no time.  I have a follow up appointment in 2 months and I'm already looking forward to going back because of the atmosphere.  Thank you Dr. Edwards!

The food is great. I love the authenticity.  I would give them 5 stars but they need to work on customer service.  I called to place an order for 7 breakfast burrito for myself and colleagues that we do every Friday for breakfast. I simply asked if it were possible if they could cut the burritos in half and the lady's reply was "we don't cut them in half" Oh. Well excuse me. It's so sad that there's no such thing as customer service anymore because they could have made an exception.  I thought to satisfy a customer, you try to meet their expectations and accommodate them. Whatever tho, overall the food was good, just need to work on their customer service skills.

I come to this place quite a bit but I'm gonna start seeking other options because it seems like the people here get even more rude.  I walk in and the owner and her friend or employee were speaking in their language and I waited until they finished because it's rude to interrupt people when they're talking but then it's rude not to greet a potential customer.  The girl that did my pedicure was rude as ever and I hate to stereotype people but it was necessary in this situation. She did a good job but was rude as hell. I didn't wanna give her a tip but luckily I came here right after church and the sermon stuck with me. Had this been a Saturday she wouldn't have received a dime. And also if you don't mind ghetto hood boogers screaming at their kids telling them to sit they ass down then you've come to the right place. I'm done with this place for good

I will never come back to this Pei Wei. I hope the lackluster food was just at the particular location because I would dislike to ex out an entire franchise. I've only been to Pei Wei once and that was years ago. The order process is already kinda weird so when I was ready to order, the girl asked me if I was dining in or ordering to go.  I said to go and she says "well this is the dine in line but it's ok"...did she really need to tell me? There was no one else in the line so I wasn't holding anyone up AND she worked both lines so what the hell does it matter?    The food from a scale to 1 to 10 was a 0.  I've never ate food with no taste.  The chicken was dry, the noodles had absolutely no seasoning.  There was only so much soy sauce I could put, I mean I had to salvage the one pack that they gave me. Cheapness.  If I wanted noodles with no taste, I could have boiled my own for free.  Lesson learned.  You guys will never get my business again!

My review is based on the service not the food.  We walk in and there were three ladies at the front and none of them bothered to look up and greet us when we walked in.  I even said "hi" and no one looked up.  We stood there for another minute or so and finally the girl asked how many was in our party.  That should have been a red flag for me because first impressions of a business is the right impression.   We sit down and our server comes to the table.  She looks like she had a damn attitude that she had to be at work.  Whatever, not my problem, I'm just hungry.  So we order drinks and then our food. We were really hungry so we were wondering if we get chips and salsa complimentary. NOPE! They wanted $12 for a simple ass chips and salsa.  Instead of being nice about it, our server acted like we couldn't afford it so we just said forget it whatever.  Our food comes and mine was fine.  My friend asked for a side of salsa and she said it was extra and because we already had a bowl of salsa that my cousin ordered, she said there was no point of her ordering any salsa.  I'm sorry; I didn't come to a restaurant for food advice, I came to eat.  So after we finish, she comes and sets the bill ON THE CHIPS THAT WE ORDERED. REALLY????? How disgusting is that?! This girl had the worst attitude and it was noticeable.  It coulda been because we were of a different race because I noticed that she was nicer to the table next to us that were of a Caucasian descent.  Don't make it noticeable that you're a complete racist or unhappy to service people. We let the manager know afterwards about the service and he was extremely apologetic and wished that we had told him sooner but it was the matter of us being able to pay for our food that she thought we couldn't afford.  I'm probably never going to come back here after that service.

I walked in just got looked at like I wasn't suppose to walk in.  I was looking at the lipsticks with every intention to buy but no one bothered to ask me if I needed any help after standing there for 3 minutes. I definitely could afford pretty much anything in this store but because of my skin color they probably thought otherwise because that's the vibe I got. Won't be back here again!

Hood, ratchet, crowded, loud.  What's the purpose to having 56 lanes and you only keep 3 open?! I bought a fabric softener one day and apparently it was leaking and the check out girl just double bagged it.  When I got to my car the bag was halfway full.  Wouldn't a store clerk instruct you to get another? I went back in and exchanged that in a hot second.  Why would I pay for a busted fabric softener that's halfway empty?! You're not dealing with your 3.5 gpa average folks here cuz DAMN! If you ever watched he episode of breaking bad where Jesse held the two meth heads hostage, you'll see some characters just like that up in this Wal Mart on the 1st and the 15th because that's when everyone gets paid/receives that government check.  It's so sad sometimes to walk in here because you know you're gonna see the most outrageous outfits and inappropriate behavior. OH and don't bother coming here on a Sunday.  It's like chuck e cheese because people bring all 28 of their damn kids!

This place never improves.  If I didn't live close to this location, I would definitely go to the one on Shea.  I went a few weeks ago just to buy frozen fruit.  I wanted to be in and out of there within 10-15 minutes (depending on how many lanes they had open). I'm clearly on the phone and this ghetto ghetto walks up to me trying to hand me something, I don't know if it was a mixtape, flyer or business card because I DID NOT CARE! Now again, I am on the phone and trying to look for the frozen fruit I needed.  I look at him with an attitude and roll my eyes because 1.I'm on the phone, 2. I'm just trying to shop! I think its ridiculous that I cannot go into a store without being bothered with solicitation that I'm sure is illegal but these hood boogers don't care.  Go get a damn job and stop trying to hustle people who work hard everyday with your mixtape, flyer or business card.

Best customer service ever.  Our food wasn't what we expected so we sent it back and the manager was nice enough to let us order an appetizer.  They comped our food and we just had t pay for the 2 drinks we ordered.  By the way, the new order they brought out to us was perfect!   The server was such a sweetheart.  I'll be back :)

I'm done with this particular location.  Customer service is beyond rude and I feel that if I'm paying $10 for a salad, you should at least have a smile on your face, fake or not.  This rude little girl (yes, if you act an ass as an adult you are nothing but a child to me) had the worst attitude ever.  You would have thought I asked her to grow the harvest for the salad I asked for.  I always order off of the menu because I can't stand when people have complicated orders, I just asked for no bleu cheese in my Cobb salad. This girl made it seem like an inconvenience.  I'm also pleasant to people who are making my food even when I can see you making it.  I said thank you and she gave me no eye contact or a your welcome.  She just handed me the hot ass bowl and moved on.  I'm pretty sure if I was not well in the head, I would have tossed that salad right back at her burnt burgundy haired ass but I didn't.  But best believe, they won't be getting my business ever again

I'm only giving them a 1 star because I have no choice. I went to serendipity a year ago for the first time and the service was great, and the food was on point. I went a few days ago and it was the complete opposite. We sat down and didn't get greeted by our server for a good 15-20 minutes, after taking our drink orders it took about 10 minutes just to get waters. I ordered the nachos and there was absolutely no meat, just cheese. Then there was confusion with our bill and it was chaos after that. It's a shame that I never wanna go back here again because of that experience.

I've been looking for a good eyebrow threader since I moved back to AZ a month ago and I think I've found the place. I walked in and they took me after about 15 minutes.  The atmosphere is cute, clean and professional. Tori is great. She definitely made my eyebrows look a lot better than what I walked in with. I'll be back!

I cannot say how impressed I was with this place.  First of all there was no wait which was already a good sign (or because it was 9am and most of the folks that went out the night before just went to bed an hour before that)...we get seated and about 3 minutes later, our server greets us.  Nicest guy ever.  Customer service is huge for me.  My cousin told him it was my birthday and he told me happy birthday and offered me a complimentary shot of whatever I wanted.  I'm sold! I ordered the chicken and waffles and OH.EM.GEE!  BOMBdotcom...I didn't even feel guilty about all of the calories because 1. it was my birthday 2. who the hell cares when it comes to chicken and waffles and 3. ITS VEGAS #turnup.  I will definitely be coming back to this place on a regular when I go back to Vegas.  Forget the buffets, this is really all I need and its way cheaper.  We went to Ceasar's before this and the buffet was $50 (but then again, it was Thanksgiving weekend).  Thank you for the excellent service.  I hope you guys keep this type of customer service consistant but I have a good feeling about it.

My check pressure light came on after a second time so I took my car to this location since I bought my tires at another meineke out of state. I called and they told me to just bring it in. I took it in on my lunch break thinking I would probably have to call a cab to get back to work.  These guys had the best customer service. They found out there was a screw in my tire and finished the job within 35 minutes and they filled my tires back up and I didn't owe anything.  I'll definitely bring my car here for oil changes now just because the service was so amazing and every guy there greets you with a hello or goodbye.  Thanks guys!!!!

If you wanna be sold a bogus plan, come to this location.  My Mom and I had a perfectly good plan so I went in to buy one of those portable Wifi devices to use strictly for my laptop and iPhone.  Dude sees our current plan--unlimited text, data, talk, you know a PERFECTLY good plan.  I simply just wanted to buy my portable device and go along my way.  So homeboy pretty much sells me on a deal by looking at my current plan which has me, my mom and grandma.  Between my mom and I, we supposedly only used 3 gigs of data a month because we have smart phones. I'm not a tech person, I don't care about gigs or whatever so I'm like oh ok that's good right? Apparently it was and he tells me he can switch my plan for us to have 10 gigs all together a month because our bill would be cheaper and this is now including my wifi device. So I'm like ok, cool.  Get the approval from my mom since she's the primary and we good to go.  3 or 4 days later I look on the device and see we've already used 4 gigs of data.  Didn't he tell me between the two of us we only use 3 a month? At this point I'm pissed! After about a week or so, we go over our gigs but best believe we don't pay for any overages because we were lied too.  Then on top of that we were charged an activation fee and deactivation fee that he NEVER mentioned but luckily the company waived all the fees because we were duped.  On top of that, the sales guy tried to holla but totally got denied.  How unprofessional can someone be.  You sell me a  BS plan and hit on me about a week later on Facebook. You'll never see me at this location again.  I might just get a verizon device because at least I know what to expect now!  Oh and by the way, they don't close at 9:00pm, it's 7:00pm.  I was going in there for a replacement charger but nope! Closed!  I had to go to the ratchet Wal Mart and buy one for twice as much!

I didn't even eat here and probably won't because they're customer service is extremely terrible.  We went up to see how long the wait would be and before I could finish saying "hi" to the rude ass hostess, she answers the phone.  At least say "just one second please".  Then this heffa had the nerve to stay on the phone for longer than she needed to be.  I have no desire to ever go back to this place after being treated like we had no money.

This is a really chill spot especially if you are a beer drinker.  They have 60 beers to choose from and the atmosphere is super chill.  I had the time of my life with the live music.  The crowd is fun and everyone that works there is really cool.  This will definitely be my new spot Friday nights.

I don't know if I was extremely hungry or what but my burrito was bomb dot com. I went during lunch and of course the line was long but it moved quickly.  The customer service was great.  The chicken was fresh and hot, the portions were perfect because some other Chipotle's put more rice than meat which makes it less appetizing. Good job

I don't know what it is, but I've driven into the shopping center and driven right back out because the line is pretty much out the door EVERY time I go.  I don't even bother getting out of my car because its a total waste of time.  Please get it together, because when I'm craving Chipotle and its extremely crowded, that becomes very annoying.

They have the best Caesar salad I've ever had.  The chicken is freshly grilled and the pita chips they use in it makes it so bomb.  I always order online because the line is always so long so I'm glad that they have that feature.

I'm so glad there's a place like this that exists! I went there for the first time today and it was so good. The place is clean and the customer service was great. I wish I got the young ladies name that helped me. She took the time to tell me how everything worked as well as a bit of background to how the meals are prepared which I appreciate.  You know your getting nothing but the best when the food is fresh. You can either heat the food there or if you work or live nearby you can just take it home.  I'll definitely be back again since I work down the street.  Thank you for the great customer service :)

I'm giving my rating based on the customer service.  I start ordering and automatically realize that the asshole making the food was exactly that...an asshole.  I felt that I was inconveniencing him when ordering my food.  I was flustered because of his negative ass energy.  He didn't crack a smile and looked like he hated his job.  That's not my damn problem, hunger is.  He just rushed me to order and it shouldn't be like that.  Next time if he's there, I'll walk out.

I went here for the first time today because it's close to my house and it seems to always be crowded.  I'm not a huge burger fan so I get a craving once every blue moon.  It took about 15 minutes to get thru the drive thru, but I figured its worth it since its alway packed.  The only thing I liked were the fries and the Stand Sauce. The burger had zero seasoning so I had to keep putting ketchup on it for every bite. I think I'll just go back for the fries and the Shakes, because they look good.  In&Out is way better and quicker.  Too bad there are none in my area -_-

I'm only giving this place a 1 star because we have to and the location is nice.  We sat down outside at 6:55 before the happy hour ended.  Our server comes up and we want to order the HH special but she tells us it's 7:00 and we can't order the specials due to the automated systems. Ok well we tried right?   I order a drink because I wasn't too hungry.  My cousin and her friend were looking at the menu to see what they wanted to order.  So our waitress comes back to the table and only asks my cousins friend if she was ready to order, takes her order and walks away.  Then she comes back to ask for my cousins order but in the most awkward and rude way.  So my cousin order like the crab wontons or something, and they turned out to be really salty.  So of course, our waitress doesn't come back to see how everything is, we have to wave her down.  She comes to the table, and my cousin tells her the wontons are really salty.  You can clearly see the salt chunks on top so she asks her if thats normal and all the waitress says is "yup".  Really?  Yup? Oh I already know what my tip is going to be after I get the bill, learn your manners girlfriend.  So once we're done, we are ready to pay buuuut our waitress is nowhere insight.  So we're noticing how super awkward she is and she makes us feel really uncomfortable.  I have to remember that I'm not longer in California and that racism is pretty huge in Arizona but geeze, why work with PEOPLE if you have some sort of prejudice?!  I'm just assuming but I got that vibe that she does not like too much diversity in one sitting.  So there was another waiter near and we ask what's her problem and he's like "I'm not really sure", so we tell him we're ready to pay.  It looks like he goes to the back to find her and a few moments later she comes back says "I heard you were looking for me..' What?! WHAT!!! Giiiiirl you seriously have an attitude problem for no reason at all.  We give her our money to pay, because you know, we surprisingly can afford it.  So we ask if we can validate with her and she says yes.  I was digging in my purse to find my ticket but I couldn't but she stood there just staring and waiting like I was inconveniencing her.  Mind you this is the longest she's ever stood at our table the entire night because she walks away super quick when she had to bring the food to the table.  I tell her nevermind, I'll get the lady at the front desk to validate, because she was making me feel very uncomfortable.  We filled out our feedback cards and let them know right away that her service was beyond unacceptable.  I don't know if I could ever give this place another chance.  I was so disappointed with the way we were treated but who knows, maybe one day.  The food overall, eh.  Maybe if it wasn't for the lackluster service, it would have been better, but homegirl ruined everyones appetite.

I love this place because they take you right away and your out of there within 5-10 minutes.  My brows looked amazing after I left and almost 2 weeks later they're still looking bomb.  This place is on the way home so it's convenient and the price is right. I hope that lady never leaves because she's the best!

DTP is the place to be.  I've been doing crossfit for two years and had to stop for a few months because I injured myself (NOT crossfit related btw). I moved back from California to Arizona and was bored with the going to the regular gym and after I felt like my shoulder was semi-ready, I needed to find a CrossFit gym that would be willing to help me into transitioning back.  I hit up DTP on Facebook and they invited me in for a workout.  I couldn't believe how sweet and encouraging everyone was to me--both the coaches and it's members.  One thing I've learned about doing CrossFit is that you don't compete against others, you compete with yourself and the others are there to cheer you on to finish no matter how crucial the workout. After my first workout, I knew I was in, just had to think about it. The homie Tom (one of the coaches) reached out after about a month and asked if I was ready.  The fact that he was nice enough to reach back out and not forget about me showed that this was the place for me.  I've been at it for almost two months and I'm getting stronger than ever.  Ali is the bomb dot com, she'll get you in line which I definitely like, I don't want someone to just tell me what I wanna hear.  All in all even if your new to crossfit, DTP is THE place to start your journey!!!  You definitely will feel like you have another family when you come here!

I really needed my hair done so I went on Craigslist trying to find a good stylist, not one that was gonna be doing hair from out of their house.  Came up on Javon's styles and loved them.  I'm from California where there is a hair stylist on every corner.  So I sent her a text asking if I could book an appointment and she was very adamant about the time for me to show up which I liked because that meant she wasn't about wasting time.  So I showed up to my appointment and Jovan is seriously the sweetest and funniest person. She knows what she's doing, she understands and keeps it real on hair care.  I sat in her chair at 10, I was out of there by 12:30 and she did a weave.  She will now be my permanent stylist to go to from now on.  I love that she's about her business and most of all, a timely person like myself.  Thank you Javon!!!!

I would give this place 5 stars but when they get more threaders in here I'll change it up.  I don't like having to wait too long but you really have no choice when you come here.  I really like the girl that normally works here, I just wish she had more help because it's pretty ridiculous to have to wait almost 20-30 minutes for something that takes less than 5 minutes.  I went two weeks ago and there was a girl before me and she ended up getting her lashes done.  Really?!  I almost asked her if I could go before her because I just needed my brows threaded but the looks of her mom, she would have definitely said no.    If this place had more threaders, they would do excellent business.

I think I found a permanent massage place.  I probably have received two great massages and this one is now added to the list. After receiving a very average massage a few weeks ago, New Serenity was my redemption. Corinna was amazing. She knew exactly which areas to trigger and which ones needed the most attention. She even worked a bit on my shoulder that I injured a few months ago and it feels great. The entire establishment is well kept, quiet and clean.  I'll definitely be back in the next few weeks!

Not one of my favorites.  The flavors were mediocre.  The only thing good were the toppings and it's way over priced.

I'd give this place no stars if I could. From the service to the food.  We came in on a Sunday afternoon, so all the day drinking crowd had already left so there weren't that many people in the restaurant.  We get seated and order drinks on their happy hour special.  The margarita had zero taste and we couldn't even get our waitress to take it back for us, we had to go up to the bartender and ask him to make a new one.  How inconvenient is that?  So then we order our food and once we get it, our waitress never came back to see how we were doing, nothing!  We had to track down a different waitress to pay our bill.  I'll never go back to this place.

I am completely happy with the installation that Justin did in my living room.  He quoted me a very reasonable price and was easy to work with as far as scheduling.    Justin is very humble and knows his stuff.  During the process of drilling, the dust from the wall ended up on the floor and his partner was sure to clean every last thing that was on the floor. It wasn't a big deal to me but the fact that they don't want to leave any mess behind was a huge plus.  I really thought it would take about an hour for him to put up my TV, before I knew it, he was done within about 25-30 minutes.  He's all about the business and honest.    I'll be using him again soon to rehang my bedroom TV and install a soundbar.  Thanks again Justin!  I could say it 100 times and I will be referring everyone I know!

Another job well done!! I needed to get one of my TVs re-hanged and another one installed in my second bedroom, and install my sound bar in my living room.  Sent an e-mail to Justin, received a quote really quick and he was out within the next few days.  He is very professional and got the job done in a timely manner.  I'm so happy with his work and will always use him for any A/V needs!  Thanks again Justin!

I'm not a huge crawfish person but this place is good.  I got the 1 pound of shrimp and that's seriously enough for one person because I couldn't finish it.  The service was good I was just confused to why their trash cans are located right outside of their entry way.  I think that's pretty gross considering they having people sitting outside and walking in.  I understand you have to dispose of everything for the guests seated out on the patio but don't place it directly in the front where everyone can see it.  Also, the beer on tap was warm which is not too pleasant so hopefully they figure it out soon since they only have been open for a few months.  Other than that, the food was bomb. Greg is a dope server.  He's personable, polite and has a positive attitude which I value in a business.  I'll be back again!

I'm so disappointed.  Me and one of my best friends come here at least 2 times a month.  Today we went and I walked out extremely disappointed.  The service was fine, our hostess is always great.  I always get the shrimp and I probably ate about 5-6 shrimp and noticed the tip of the shrimp was raw.  Usually when I break the head off its red that comes out but this time it was brown which indicated the shrimp was undercooked.  I never send food back, ever!  I let the hostess know that shrimp was not cooked all the way so she asked me if I wanted another pound, I said yes.  10 minutes go by, then 15 minutes go by.  At this point, I'm over it and let her know to cancel the order.  I walked out still hungry and just irritated.  The food has gone down and by the other recent reviews saying that their food was undercooked should be a red flag to the business!  Please fix this, or I will just have to give Angry Crab another try as well as my business!

I had to come and update my review from my last experience.  It went a lot better and the food was so good that I almost couldn't finish what I had left.  The service is always great and when we were finished, Emily took care of us and made sure we were completely satisfied with the food.  I commend them for trying to redeem themselves to make sure we left happy.  I told Emily we don't want to go to the competitor because we love Hot N Juicy way too much.  I know we'll be back in a few weeks!  Thanks again Emily!!!

This will definitely be my go to when I'm in the area. Frost gelato was fresh and delicious.  Right when I walked in, I was greeted immediately by the nicest young ladies.  Amanda was a sweetheart and extremely helpful with letting me sample flavors and telling me which ones were her favorites.  She was so polite and personable, I was sure to leave her and the other girl a tip.  The ambiance is bright and clean.    I'll be back soon! Thanks again Amanda for your outstanding customer service!!

Just because they're sweet and so nice to you, doesn't reflect they're business one bit.  I purchased my first home last year and wanted to save money as far as buying a refrigerator.  I was driving around one day and I couldn't find what I was looking for and then I passed Mi Casa.  I went in, was treated nicely and ended up buying a refrigerator for a decent price.  Had it delivered that same day, but I didn't know that I would have to help with getting the unit up my stairs.  Thank goodness I do CrossFit because idk how the refridge would have got into my condo.  So the refridge turned out to be a good fit for my kitchen and I was so impressed with how nice the people were here, decided to give them more of my business and purchase a front load washer and dryer.  Purchased these and had them delivered.  Did my first load of laundry.  After about a month and a half, the dryer goes out.  It was making a buzzing noise so I had to unplug it.  Called these folks and let them know that the dryer went out and it was under the 90 day guarantee.  They came out, brought another dryer, few weeks later, I check my clothes after about 40 minutes, they're damp as ever.  This dryer kept going out in the middle of every cycle. It was the most frustrating thing ever. I'm sorry, but just because this stuff is used doesn't mean you should sell people junk.  Had them bring a THIRD dryer out and so far, it works ok but let me knock on wood.  NOW the stupid washer goes out in the middle of the cycle.  At first, I thought it was my electricity.  Luckily I know an electrician so he came out and looked at the wiring and found nothing.  Pretty much I've been sold junk.  Sooooo guess what happened recently, my refridge went out not even after 1 year!  I'm sorry but this isn't how you run a business.  I've spent over $1,000 with this business and the fact that it was a waste makes me furious.  Since it's my first home, I try to save as much as I could but I'm fortunate enough to afford new appliances now, so today I purchased a brand new refrigerator from Best Buy.  It's useless to go thru second, third or fourth hand shit that doesn't work after a few months.  I don't have the time, money or energy for this so for any future customers, consider these factors before you purchase anything.  I'm all about supporting local businesses but I now have second thoughts.

I went here for the first time this past weekend and wow.  My eyebrows are on point!  I've been going to a certain threading place and it's always been crowded lately which means once the person gets to my eyebrows, they feel rushed and leads to not the best job.  I contacted Farida and she instantly texted me back with a time and day to come by.  She probably took 5 minutes on me and her price is so reasonable.  My eyebrows look great, she kept my shape because you know how important that is! I will continue to go to her now on. Thank you, Farida!

I love the food here because its freshly made.  I ordered online for lunch and when I got there to pick it up, they hadn't made it yet but I was offered a drink on the house.  This is how you do business and this is why this place is successful.  I love the new location and I'm glad they didn't move far at all.
