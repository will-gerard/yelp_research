As much as I love their pizza, I'm very irritated with them today.  I visited the Gilbert location last Thursday for an early birthday dinner with my children.  I was informed that they were cleaning their ovens and it would be an hour and a half wait.  We did not want to wait that long so I thanked them and said we'd be back in a couple days.  We went back today, only this time we went for lunch so as to avoid the "oven cleaning" that apparently happens every day starting at 4:00 pm.  Today however, we were greeting by the hostess only to be told that they are closed to replace the oven.  Really???  I wasted my gas again for this?  You should have told me on Thursday that you were closing to replace the oven.

Normally I love So Cal for fish tacos! Today they were very unprepared for the lunch crowd!!  Never have I waited so long for service! Someone simply stopping by our dirty table, introducing themselves and letting us know it would be a few minutes was obviously too much to ask for. We walked out and walked across the street to Joyride Taco House where we were greeted with a smile, and impeccable service even though they have a packed house as well.
