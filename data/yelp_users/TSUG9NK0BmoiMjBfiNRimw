Wow! After landing in Phoenix, AZ I was incredibly un-impressed by the dry, plain, boring looking atmosphere. Honestly, it was a bit of a disappointment at first site...but, Phoenix might be one of those places that grows on you after a while. And, I think it's because of these unassuming gems like Barrio Cafe. I was so impressed by the professionalism, kindness, and knowledge of the staff. They know their food!   When it comes to food, let's just get to the best - Cochinita Pibil A.K.A. pork taco greatness! This juicy pork is slow roasted overnight and marinated in achiote and sour orange and you know what, even though it says that on the menu they really don't have to describe it. You can taste every spice in such a clear way. I can tell they take great care of every ingredient, and if anyone can get me to actually enjoy pickled onions they must be a genius. Yes, it's true...the chef at Barrio Cafe is a genius!  Other recommended items include:  Horchata (not your average Horchata either, this one's special) The Camaron - Shrimp Taco, was really good too  Listen, if you're in AZ this weekend because of the Superbowl or another sporting event, you'd really be doing yourself a disservice if you don't come by Barrio Cafe and give their food a try. You'll be really satisified with the truly authentic Mexican food

I'd like to title this review: "The Power of Taking Ownership"  My wife and I recently got married in Charlotte, NC. Our Wedding Planner booked the Crowne Plaza for their Honey Moon Suites package. (We needed somewhere local to stay for the night before our honey moon trip).  The night of our wedding, after an EXTREMELY long day, beautiful wedding, and hours of dancing/partying...we arrive in Crowne Plaza me in my tuxedo and my wife still in her wedding dress. When I gave them our names at the front desk, they did not have either of us in the system for a room that night.  We spoke with the manager and had her check with our credit cards and no reservation was to be found. After 20 minutes of exhausting research...nothing came up and I started calling my wedding planner (by now, my wedding planner was asleep after an exhausting 350 person wedding she helped to execute).   Luckily, our wedding planner had all email correspondence with Crowne Plaza's sales rep on file. She began to forward these emails as evidence to Crowne Plaza's manager who was searching for our reservation. By this time, my wife was sleeping in the car, I was exhausted standing on my feet in front of this woman who I was starting to get very irritated with.  However, due to my exhaustion I did something I normally do not do - I stayed quiet & patient.  All of a sudden, I noticed the look on the Hotel Manager's face change...her attitude changed instantly as she read the emails and realized that the Hotel's Sales Rep confirmed our reservation but never put it into the system.  INSTANTLY - Crowne Plaza's Manager (or supervisor whoever this woman was) apologized multiple times, took full ownership for the error, and made our stay at Crowne Plaza on the house!!!!  :)  Not only that but she threw in a few extras that I will not mention so that I don't get anyone in trouble...our stay at the Crowne Plaza was the first of many blessings & gifts in our marriage! :)  Something that had the potential to ruin our evening actually blessed us tremendously. Not just the saved $$$...but the respect, professinoalism, and superior maturity that the hotel manager exercised when she took ownership. I am more than impressed.  A review that would have been 1 or 2 star is 5 stars because of one honorable hotel manager who had the common sense to make no excuses, take ownership, and treat a customer the way they deserve to be treated.   Both me and my wife travel often on business, we both have family in Charlotte, NC and because of that hotel manager we will stay at one hotel and one hotel only - the Crowne Plaza Charlotte!  I look forward to staying at a hotel managed by professional, mature leaders!

Ugh...why didn't I just check Yelp first? Clearly I'm exhausted and my filter was lowered. In this vulnerable state I found myself wandering over to Lolo's and it's just not good. Very simple, plain, flavorless food. I've had chicken and waffles in about 10 states and never had it this poorly seasoned. The only reason they got two stars is because I appreciate that they cook to order and the collards are decent and the chicken is juicy, but you know what so is water and it pretty much tastes the same.   Who knows maybe the non-airport version of Lolo's is better
