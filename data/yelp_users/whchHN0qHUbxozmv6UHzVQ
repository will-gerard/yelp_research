I have very high standards when it comes to my nails and waxing maintenance. I heard about this salon when I noticed how perfect my co workers nails always were, As soon as I knew the name and number I was booking an appointment. My first visit was with Emily (for a shellac manicure, her specialty) who did not disappoint. I have seen a few other people there when Emily is not available and they all do an amazing job. Each have their own technic but the finish product is nothing less then perfect. If you are looking for a cheap wax (price not quality) then this is your spot as well. I'm always scared to get my underarms waxed but decided to give at shot...the esthetician did such a great job in causing minimal pain (it's your armpit so...it's not gonna feel great) and was sure to get every last hair. If you go there tell the person at the desk what your preferences are and they will make sure to match you up with a nail tech or esthetician that meets your requirements!

I came to this office in December of last year. It had been a few years since I had seen a dentist, so I anticipated a cavity or TWO and definitely a cleaning. Well my name was called i went in..with the ASSISTANT ...not the hygienist(which I thought was weird) she proceeded to look over my teeth using a machine that basically tells them where you have cavities or potential ones. The dentist came in for about 30 seconds was very unfriendly, he began to look at my teeth very quickly and not gentle. By the end of this appointment I needed 6 fillings and a procedure called an SRP which is what someone with gum disease would need. I was devastated that my teeth were that bad. It had been awhile but I didn't think I neglected my mouth that much. This visit made me so upset that i couldnt bring myself to go back, besides the fact i couldnt afford what they recommended.  Recently I went to another dentist for an actual cleaning and a 2nd opinion. There I was told that no SRP was needed, just a cleaning and I had ONE cavity. I have always loved going to the dentist and this place almost ruined that for me. They are only about making money and have zero concern for the patient needs or their bank account. Worst experience ever! They don't even deserve a star.

I heard about Arizona Airbrush from a friend who dances with the Suns. I figured if a professional dance team uses them, then I could trust my tan would look great. I'm glad I did, my tan is always perfectly even, the color is great and last longer then other sprays I have had. I never have a problem getting an appointment due to the super convenient hours! They staff is also super friendly and professional. Love this place!
