I have been bringing my cars to get serviced at this location for years and I have always gotten great service.  Today was no exception, friendly employees and fast service!  Thanks for all your help, Albert!

I called to order delivery and this adorable raspy voiced lady kept me chatting while she pulled someone's pie out of the oven and boxed it.  I ordered the 18" meat lovers pizza, 2 dozen wings, antipasti salad and a couple cannolis for my husband and myself.  We've barely made a dent in all this food!  The pizza crust is perfect, they were super generous with the meat.  The wings were a perfect extra crispy as I requested.  The salad was fresh, cold and crisp.  The cannoli was complete heaven.  The delivery time was about 50 minutes, which I was informed of when I placed my order.  It was all well worth the wait!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!!

Discount Tire is the ONLY place I will EVER get tires!!  I only wish I could give more stars.   Fast and friendly service.  Very knowledgeable staff that goes above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction.  No pressure to buy more than you can afford.  They helped me stay within budget and when I got a flat, it was replaced for free.  That replacement coverage is priceless.

We were at the Hilton just down the street for Mother's Day weekend.  We enjoyed dinner here so much on Saturday night that we went the next day for mother's day brunch!  The food, service and atmosphere were all on point.  Tiffany helped us so much by moving our table to a shadier spot for brunch.  Just a small thing, but greatly appreciated! We were especially impressed by their head chef proudly carving the prime rib and pork loin for brunch.  He was super  nice!  Thank you for helping us have an amazing mother's day weekend!!

We got an overnight package for the Mad Monster Convention here on Mother's Day weekend.  Every staff member I came in contact with was oh so gracious and accommodating!  Requests for more coffee for our suite were almost instantly fulfilled, and we are coffee fiends!  Checking in was quick and painless.  We live in Phoenix but plan on booking many more staycations here in the future.  And BIG KUDOS to your night front desk supervisor, (I think his name is Rob), for reassuring this worry wart that my little surprise staycation for my mother in law would go smoothly.  Thank you for one of the best Mother's Days ever!

If I could give TEN stars, I would.  I had a little overnight birthday staycation/sleepover for my niece and a few of her friends here.  We just lost my sister to pancreatic cancer in March and I wanted to make sure everything was perfect and special for my niece's birthday, so I called a few days ahead with questions.  The girl I spoke to on the phone was so nice (sorry, I really need to write names down!!) and patient with me.  I was on a very limited budget and I wanted to make sure there wouldn't be any glitches because I reserved a suite through a third party. Check in was smooth and the front desk clerk was so friendly!  The pool was great, love the fresh warm towels by the cabanas!  We were short on pillows and a blanket for the sofa bed and our request was filled in literally the blink of an eye!  The complimentary breakfast was awesome.  Above and beyond my expectation of cereal dispensers and stale pastries.  Loved the omelette station and french toast! We had a few hours between check out and the kids being picked up by my brother in law so THANK YOU for having your shuttle drop us off at the mall!    Side note: I was informed by my girlfriend that helped me set up: the suite we were in was the exact same suite where my bachelorette party took place TWO YEARS AGO.  That just tickles me.    Great experience, great staff.  Can't wait for my next staycation!

Found a Groupon ($20 for $10) and decided to eat here before a gaming night with friends.  My husband and I split the wings as an appetizer and split a medium pizza.  The wings are described as crispy baked wings on the menu, but they are just baked.  No crisp to them BUT they ARE quite tasty (we got BBQ).  For the pizza my husband got the house special on his half, and I got the "philosopher's" something on mine.  The pizza crust was amazingly buttery crispy and chewy.  The house special side was awesome.  I didn't care for the philosophers side.  I think it was more personal than any mistake of the kitchen.  My husband loved it all.    Why five stars if the food wasn't perfect?  I don't blame the restaurant because I tried and didn't like something I have never tried before.  Also, the service was above and beyond, even though our server knew we had a Groupon from the moment we sat down.  I have been greeted with horrible attitudes and contempt in the past when it has been made known that I have a Groupon.   This guy wasn't phased at all,  he didn't treat us any differently from the large group next to us.  I'm terribly with names, but he was a bartender and we were in there on Monday 8/31 right after the storm.  We will be in there again this Monday, hopefully I will find a pizza combo I like this visit!

Girls weekend in Vegas definitely required some recovery time at our resort and I found this restaurant through Bite Squad food delivery service.  My roomie is vegetarian and the food was delicious and beautifully seasoned.  This was our first time having Indian food.  The vegetable fritters and garlic naan were our favorites!  The  vegetable Manchurian was delicious, too.  I'm not vegetarian but I had it that way for my friend and the food was very filling and satisfying.  The option of heat level when ordering is a good thing, too.

I was so happy to see a Jimmy Johns close to my home! My first few times, no problem because I called in or stopped by as the store is less than two miles from me and I was in the area anyway. The problem lies in delivery. I've been in all day and didn't feel like leaving the house so I called to get sandwiches delivered. I was so annoyed by having to repeat my address FIVE TIMES to two different people I cancelled the whole process. It's not a complicated street name and these people had no problem understanding what I said when I was ordering. OH and how long ago did you take sprouts off your menu JJ's? I know it's been over a year so STOP PRINTING THAT YOU HAVE THEM! I apologize but I get a little cranky when I'm hungry, help is on the way thanks to the chinese delivery man who can write down an address! Bottom line for this place, stop in or pick up because their ears stop working when you try to give them an address.....

Update:  The four stars is for the quality and consistent quality of the sandwiches.  I waited over an hour for two sandwiches last week.  I'd already paid online for them so I had two free meals on file, I'm guessing through my phone number so I decided to redeem today.  The free sandwiches were at my door in less than 15 minutes, which is a good thing.  At least I now know this location is capable of finding my address within a reasonable amount of time.  I have had 100% positive experiences with another Jimmy John's location downtown which is why I keep giving this location closer to home chances.  The sandwiches have always been fresh and tasty, the employees just need a little more training on GPS and customer service.

My favorite place for Snoh in Phoenix!  The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable.  My favorite flavor is honeydew!  I tried the dairy free pistachio tonight and it was fantastic!  Loving the new combo menu too!  Keep up the good work!  Love this place!

I had my first acai bowl in Hawaii and I was thrilled to find this place on groupon AND on my way to work!  I have been going once (maybe twice) a week for the last month.  Around my third visit,  the guy at the counter actually remembered how I order my bowl (granola on the side).  I like the straight acai sorbet bowl with bee pollen, goji berries and cacao nibs, my hubby loved the  PB Chocolate!  The service is consistently friendly, there is usually a small wait for your bowl, but it is worth it!  The fresh juices are quite tasty, too!  Warning: acai bowls are addictive!

Fast greets both at the door and the table.  Our server Marion was quick and knowledgeable, which helped us because we were starving and wanted everything on the menu.  The coffee braised beef and the spicy pork tacos were our faves!  And the street corn...AMAZING.  Can't wait to go try more tacos!  Loved it.

This will be the second AC location I have had the pleasure of visiting.  We went on a Monday and it was packed for their "Mixed Bag" Monday special, which we didn't really know about, but were out of at dinner time.  Our server was great.  Very helpful to my friends and my husband who had never been to Angry Crab.  I don't remember his name, but when my friend's blue crab took almost a half hour longer than the rest of the table's food, our server expressed genuine concern and strived to make our experience  positive for the rest of the meal.  Management never visited the table, but he said management took care of it.  My two pounds of snow crab legs were perfectly cooked and delicious.  My husband's shrimp were way over cooked but he was okay with it.    Service:  5 STARS.  Food:  3 STARS.    I will consider visiting this location again someday and give their kitchen another chance because I have had such consistently great meals at the Indian School Road location.  Until then, I prefer the atmosphere and food in their  (larger) Arcadia location that also has barbeque!

We had a party of twelve and Kristen handled our meal and took care of us with a contagious smile and gracious attitude.  The food was delicious and timely with generous portions!  Everyone in our party raved about the whole experience.  I can't thank Kristen enough for keeping up with us constantly changing seats to catch up since most of us hadn't seen each other in a few months.  I had the beef tartare hot stone rice bowl (bibimbap) and I can't believe I ate the whole thing!  Can't wait to go back, which is more than I can say for Gelato 64, two doors down.

If I could give zero stars, I would.  I think the day I went, someone mistook the sugar for salt.  The pulled pork tasted like candied sawdust.  I only tasted sweet, dry and porky.  And my roll was hard and stale.  When I asked for a new one, the guy literally molested my roll looking for a soft spot on it before giving me a new roll that was EVEN WORSE.    Grossed.   Out.      Joes Farm Grille and the Joe's in Gilbert should know how grossly their food is being misrepresented.

I decided to treat myself to lunch after a grueling six-day work week at my bartending job.  Immediate greet from smiling faces was great!  My server, Dwayne, was attentive and took his time explaining the menu as it was my first time here.  I decided to go with the BBQ side of the menu and had the big BBQ platter.  I had the pulled pork, pulled chicken and ribs.  Pork and chicken were tender and delicious, baked beans and slaw were tasty but the ribs were a little dry and over done (good flavor, though).  Definitely invest an extra dollar in your meal for their fresh baked bread!  Crusty warm goodness! Five stars for the outstanding service.  And  I will definitely be back to give the ribs another chance and to try the seafood.  Two thumbs up!!

This will be my second review of this restaurant and they get five stars, AGAIN.  Consistent level of great service!  Immediate greet both at the door and at my table.  My server (WILL) was very knowledgeable and offered great suggestions.  I had the snow crab with the trifecta seasoning and I added potatoes, corn and sausage.  It was a beautiful mess and I  can't wait to come back.  I also decided to give the ribs a second chance so I ordered some to go for my husband.  They look much more appetizing than my last visit. Keep it up, Angry Crab!  One of my new favorites!!

My husband and I come to Endgame every Monday to meet with friends and play tabletop games.  I have to be honest, when we first started coming, the kitchen was not that great.  BUT it has come a long way in the many months we've been coming (every Monday night for almost a year).  The hand cut fries are awesome (try them Cajun style!).  FRESH chicken fingers breaded and cooked to order, unique sauces for the wings, quesadillas overloaded with cheese!  They use REAL cheese for the burgers, not nasty process cheese food singles, my hubby loves the pepper jack and bacon.  My absolute favorite thing is the fried pickles.  They use spicy dill spears and the crust they get on them is PERFECTION.  There are homemade cookies and baked treats for cheap at the order station most of the time!  Okay, enough about the food.  The staff is always courteous and happy to see our group.  Some weeks we all get food and drinks, some weeks we are all broke and don't spend so much but the level of great service doesn't falter.    There are TV's with every gaming console EVER, and couches, and a full bar surrounded with TV's and with an amazing selection of craft beers.  Aaron is usually our bartender and he's always very friendly!    I don't know how business is  the rest of the week at Endgame, but I always look forward to Monday nights because of this bar.  Thanks for being here!!

So yes, I am one of THOSE people that searches Groupon for new restaurants to try.  And I found one for Stufrageous.  We walked in, and I was immediately  impressed with the cleanliness, the atmosphere and the smile from the cook.  When the girl at the counter realized it was our first time here, she gave us a couple of fries with their special sauce to taste.  Delish!  My husband got the mac & cheese burger (stuffed with m&c, bacon and jalapeño), fries and a shake.  I built my own burger:  stuffed with spinach, bacon, swiss, mushrooms and onions.  We both upgraded to the 8oz patties, too.   We got tempura green beans and mac & cheese bites (my fave!) as an appetizer.  The food came out quickly, it was hot and fresh.  WOW!  Just.  WOW.    Great burgers, great service.  The manager stopped by and checked on our food quality.  We ended up taking half our food home, which will make an awesome lunch tomorrow!    We will definitely be back, whether we have a groupon or not!   Ten stars!  Seven thumbs up!  Loved it!!

Okay, I have eaten wings from here four times, so I guess it is review time.  This review is only from a TAKE OUT viewpoint.  Bad news first?  Okay then....  First, two stars for the yelp listing saying "yes" under delivery.  You have to download a second party delivery app.  Luckily this place is less than five minutes from me.    Next, two stars for service.  I have called in orders as well as walked in and ordered four times in the last 3 weeks.  The clerk (same lady all four times) has yet to crack a smile or even act appreciative of anyone's business, let alone remember someone's face that has tipped them.  Maybe she is just working long hours?  Someone needs a spa day, maybe?      Wait.  It gets better, I promise.  I am torn between 3 & 5 stars for the food.  As I have ordered pretty much the same flavors, (citrus Chipotle & medium) pretty much the same way (EXTRA CRISPY) every time.  Twice they got it right, twice my wings were just regular, soggy skinned wings. (My husband ate them so not a HUGE deal, except I was disappointed) So I'm torn because I don't know if it was the cooks disregarding my request,  or if it was the person taking my order completely omitting my request for extra crispy wings.  Tonight, I found a couple of wings that I could eat in the two dozen that I got.    And the five stars goes to......  Flavors!  Flavors!  Flavors!  The wing sauces have been consistent every time. When my wings were done right, I didn't even share with my husband!!  Delicious!  Outstanding!!  The amazing fresh cut fries kept me from driving back and returning my soggy wings tonight.  The kool aid takes me back to childhood in augusta GA....just like Mama used to make!  The cooks are very friendly and quick to say hello, too.    Final tally:  three and a half stars, because I believe in this place and I have a feeling this place will make me change  my rating to five stars in the future.   I will just have to walk in and wait for my order, then check it before I go instead of calling it in and just grabbing it.  I really REALLY loved the wings when they got them crispy like I like them!

I said in a previous review that I hoped this place would give me a reason to give them five stars.  And they did not disappoint!  FIVE STARS ACROSS THE BOARD.  I had a sleepover/staycation at a Scottsdale resort for my niece and four of her friends and decided I would make some side dishes and pick up wings for dinner.  Went in a few hours before I needed to pick up to place the order and pay for everything.  It was tricky since I was ordering for teenagers plus ordering some for my husband who took the 10 year old nephew for the night.   Sorry, I am horrible with names but they were younger-- (aged mid twenties?)--the girls that helped me we so accommodating when I explained what I needed.  They let me taste sauces and helped me guess what a teenage palate would like.  I got a mix of plain boneless wings with dipping sauces and bone-in medium and honey habanero.  (120 wings total) They were kind enough to package some separately for the boys.  My order was hot and ready at the exact time I asked for it to be ready.  AND my bone-in wings were the perfect extra well done way that I asked for!  Thank you so much.  Everyone loved the wings!

The menu looked amazing and my husband and I were super excited to try this new place.  After ordering waters to drink, and practically memorizing the menu while waiting for our server to come back, we walked out after attempting to get the attention of the two bartenders, the manager and two servers (maybe hosts?)  hovering at the bar. Two stars for decor and concept, unfortunately I have no desire to go back and try the amazing looking menu.
