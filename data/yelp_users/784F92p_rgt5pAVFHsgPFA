Not impressed at all. Matter a fact disappointed in not only the school but he entire ata organization. We have attended different schools in the state and even schools in other states, and every school is different. Different philosophy and different disciplines.  The school in Laveen seems to be more worried about increasing their number of students then actually teaching the art of taekwondo.   My son has been doing taekwondo for over four years, wtf and ata. I sit and watch kids graduating to a higher rank that can't do the simple kicks and punches. Classes are way to big! No good instructions and it seems that the instructors have no control of the classes.   When did this become more about the money and enrollment numbers, than the technique and discipline of taekwondo?
