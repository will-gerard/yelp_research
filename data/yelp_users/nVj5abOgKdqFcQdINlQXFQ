I took my Suburban into the Brake Shop after reading the reviews on Yelp.  I am always nervous about taking my cars to mechanics, I've been ripped off before and I don't know enough about cars to know if I'm being treated fairly.  The assistant manager, Carl checked out my car free of charge and determined that I needed just my rear brakes changed.  I had dragged my feet about going to get my brakes repaired because I knew it was going to cost a lot, and there's not a lot of extra money during Christmas time.  The cost was about half of what I expected and only took about an hour.  I will not only recommend the Brake Shop to everyone I know, I'm also sending my husband in there this week to have his truck checked out.  It's not often you find a mechanic you feel you can trust, but you can definitely trust these guys, and we're driving all the way from Queen Creek for our repairs.

Last night was my second time going to Blue Wasabi, although it's been 3 years since the last.  I actually went there with a group of business associates and when I had called to reserve a table for 10 I was told that I couldn't reserve one.  I showed up about an hour earlier than my coworkers in order to save a table and informed the hostesses that the rest of my party would be about an hour.  They did not have a problem with it and quickly sat me.  About an hour later the manager came up to me and told me, very rudely, that I'd been there for an hour and a half (actually, it was just one hour) and that my party would need to show up soon or he'd have to give my table away.  He acted like I had planned it this way and had not informed the hostesses, which is not what happened.  Five minutes later my party started arriving but the manager chose to seat part of my table anyway with another party.  He was beyond rude and condescending.  I'm with a medical practice, the group I was meeting with are all surgeons and doctors.  It's difficult for us to show up at a scheduled time because surgeries sometimes go longer than expected.  We had hoped to make it in time for happy hour and in fact, everybody did, but the waiter did not take their orders on time so they missed the happy hour prices.  I ordered two martinis, a small salad and one of the light entrees, everything but the salad was happy hour price or half price and my bill was $29.  The drinks were weak, but overpriced and the food was very small portions.  This place is way overpriced and not a place I'd ever go to to meet up with friends again.  They seem to care more about getting people in and out as quickly as possible and discourage you from enjoying a meal with friends.  Needless to say none of us will be back.

Stopped by to have labs and there were 4 people waiting. 30 minutes after I signed in I asked how much longer, they hadn't even taken my lab form. The lady at the desk said 'we'll do you have an appointment' I didn't but the lady sitting next to me said 'I had an appointment 30 minutes ago'. Unbelievably SLOW and rude!!!!!!

Had the best time EVER!!!  So much fun.  We did the apartment and had 8 players with us.  We were able to escape.  Was a great team/friend building experience.  The staff was very friendly and excited about our group.  Such a great experience!!  I can't wait to try another 'escape'!!!  It was money well spent and a nice change for a night out with friends!  I'd recommend this to anyone!!

I decided to try this place after reading all of the fantastic reviews! I'm always looking for really good BBQ and I live just down the street, so it was a win-win situation. We ordered an assortment of the meals so that we could eat "family style" at home and then added on cornbread and cornbread cake.  The lady who took our order on the phone was as nice as could be and beyond helpful. When we picked up our food which was ready right on time, the owner had written the contents on each box and gave us an assortment of BBQ sauces on the side to try, since we were going to be eating family style and everyone has different likes.  The ride home was difficult due to the fabulous smells coming from the bags, and the food lived up to the reviews!! The Rib tips were amazing and didn't even make it to any plates, they disappeared right out of the box, without even BBQ sauce! We'd also ordered the shredded beef,  chopped pork and St. Louis Style ribs!  The ribs were so tender they just fell off the bone, all the meat was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of smokiness in the taste and with the BBQ sauce added, everything was amazing!! The sides were Caribbean rice, fries and mac and cheese, all just as good as expected.  The cornbread and cornbread cake were amazing, and I don't really like cornbread (I'd bought it for my father-in-law to try) I'm so happy to have found this gem in Queen Creek, we'll definitely be making this a regular dining experience!!
