MORE STAFF NEEDED!!!!!!! The staff here do 5 star work, but it seems that there are more cars then staff so the wait is super long. The cars are drying in the sun before they can really wipe them down. Again, 5 STARSHIP to the STAFF, 2 STARS TO THE MANAGERS!!

Great food and great service. I will definitely be coming back here in the future. Although, you have to watch your step, but its not a deal breaker.

Although the staff was friendly and they were very quick. I would have rather waited a little while longer and had them actually clean the car. I had some spilled soda on the driver side door panel and in the cup holder. They didn't even bother to clean it. Now I think I should have not left a tip. No wonder they have on 3 full stars on here.

I was very disappointed in the atmospher of this Chili's location. My server was very monotone and really didnt even seem to care untill it came to the end when we needed checks. I told the hosts that we were there with some friends for a Birthday, she told us that she would let our server know. About 15 min afyer we staryed eating, I went to remind him. He told me, "We can give her ice cream, but they could not sing becaise they got comolaint." WTF is that about. The Chili's on litchfield sing to there birthday guests all the time. He said they would bring ice cream, but that never happened either. I guess that another resturant on Bell I will not be going to.

GREAT FOOD!! But how the hell does a Chinese food restraint run out of chow mein on a weekday at lunch time. Get your shit together. I don't see any managers. Must be nice.

The people here are really friendly. Great job!!! Keep up the good work. I didn't wait for very long at all. I would recommended this Urgent Care to anyone on the West side.

So lets start with the bad. I asked for my eggs to be over medium and the came over medium/hard. Ok, now that that's out of the way......WOW!!! The food was amazing. I got "The Chop & Chick". The pork rib chop was cooked perfectly. Great seasoning blend, I did add salt, but then I add salt to everything. The homefries were delicious. And the eggs, even though they weren't as runny as I like, were good as well. I also had white toast which you could tell was made from scratch and came with a blueberry preserve, which was also delicious. 5 Star restaurant. I will definitely be talking about Matt's Big Breakfast to all my friends. Keep up the good work.

Great bar tenders, good prices. You just can't go wrong. The Friday night DJ seems to be still training, I give him a B-. Great atmosphere as well.

Simply delicious. But what would expect with fresh ingredients. I loved the "Special Import" Pepsi from Mexico. Its been to long since I've had Pepsi from a glass bottle. I will definitely be coming back here and letting everyone know about it.

RUDE! DISRESPECTFUL! ARROGANT!   I wish I could have better words to describe this "new" establishment. Most of the bartenders and bar backs were nice, but one in particularly semi bald and doesn't know what a simple drink like a Bay Breeze is. Plus over priced for a bar that is competing with many Many MANY other gay and straight bars with 1000x better personal. It's kind of sad really. But if the owner wants to higher rude bartenders far be it for me to stop her.
