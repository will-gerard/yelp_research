Perverts and drunks   I have been hashing almost every Monday for over a year now and I must say its a total waste of time.. Well it's better than sitting on your fat ass but, seriously what kind of idiot wants to run in 115deg weather and drink shitty beer.  If Stupid songs and dancing like a new born horse are your thing you will probably fit in just fine. But it's not all bad there is the chance of drinking out of a sweaty shoe or end up with a nickname your mother would disown you of she heard.. My advice would be to skip this group of hooligans and stay at home in our air conditioning watching Jersey shore or what ever you hip kids are into these days.

overpriced, underseasoned  $6.25 for a basic cheese quesadilla steak was grissly and greasy with no seasonings  we gave it a try but won't retun, Chipotle is just across the parking lot.
