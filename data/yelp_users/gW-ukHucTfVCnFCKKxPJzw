It's really awesome to have this locally owned micro-brewery right on Central. What's even better is that they have really awesome food to go along with the beer that's brewed right on site.   I've loved all the beers that they brew. My personal favorite is the Stinger IPA. Food wise, the Kobe beef burger is awesome. I did order the steak and shrimp here once and it was very good as well. This is one of my favorite places to do day drinking when I get the chance. The outdoor patio in the middle should be very nice to sit at and enjoy one of their finely crafted brews in the next couple of months. The mural on the back is awesome too.

This is the only reliable Mongolian bbq place I've found locally. This is a great place to go for a quick lunch that's not fast food and not overpriced. For about $7.50, you can get a huge bowl of food, a cup of soup, a drink, and a to go box to take your leftovers with you. I usually get two meals out of one visit here.   The dining area is always clean. Nice outdoor patio.

We ended up at this place when we tried to hit Over Easy at 11:45 on a Sunday morning and were told they were closed. Bummer!   Didn't want to wait in line at Matt's and had been wanting to try this place for awhile. Took the trip down Camelback Rd. to The Breakfast Club.   The wait was pretty decent for a Sunday morning in the middle of old town Scottsdale. The host was friendly and helpful and seated us at a communal table with plenty of room between us and the other couple that was seated there.  I started off with a cup of coffee and my girlfriend went with a glass of fresh pineapple juice. Our drinks came quickly. The coffee was pretty great at this place. Hit the spot nicely. My girlfriend's pineapple juice was perfectly chilled and crisp.   She came back to take our order. I went with the Mignon Benedict and my girlfriend went with the roasted turkey benedict. The food arrived pretty quickly, and my glass of coffee was refilled a few times in the meantime. Atmosphere was nice and relaxing, despite the expected ridiculousness of some of the people that hang out in Old Town.   My food was fantastic. The steak was still red in the center. At $13 for the sandwich, I wasn't expecting the quality of steak I got. My girlfriend's dish was actually even better than mine. Our waitress was fantastic. Definitely hitting this spot again.

This place is overly trendy and the sushi isn't very good at all. Two stars for the sake bomber happy hour specials.

This place is pretty trashy, I'd rather smoke my hookah at home.

I enjoy hanging out on the patio at this place. Diverse crowd, cheap drinks, always something going on. I don't live in Tempe, so I don't hit this place very often, but I always enjoy myself when I do.

This is one of my favorite bars in the world to spend time at. The crowd is always a great mix of people. The drinks are always cheap and come quick. I always run into a friend or two that I haven't seen for awhile, and wasn't expecting to see here.   It does get overly crowded sometimes, but that is definitely part of the charm.

This is the best Mexican food restaurant in town. Hands down. Don't skimp on the guac and make sure to get a margarita. The wait is well worth it.

Let's just get this out of the way first, this place makes one serious steak. As in, I have trouble getting out of my seat to walk to my car after finishing one. Richardson's is real southwestern food. Southwestern food with a lot of original ingredients and some serious kick.   there's always good music playing. The decor is awesome at this place. It's real dark and relaxing. Big booths with pillows in them as well.  Combine that with the bar serving out some awesome drinks, and it's pretty hard to pry me out of my booth. Even without the huge steak mentioned before.

I'm going to go ahead and say this place sucks.   This place claims to be a "Seattle style coffee shop". After living in Seattle for a few years, and hitting every coffee spot in the city at least once, I think I can fairly comment on that. First off, the coffee is pretty good. It's definitely Seattle style coffee, though realistically not up to Seattle standards at all. That's alright, this is a coffee shop in Phoenix, where there are few (if any) shops that actually hold up to the quality of Seattle coffee.   What really rubs me the wrong way, and definitely doesn't fit in with the Seattle element, is the service and staff at this place. I don't want to say this is the case with everyone that works here, as Ben and DJentrification (sorry I don't know your real name) have always been awesome whenever I've gone in, but the majority of people that work here are really stuck up. Maybe this should be stated another time and another place, but:  Dear Phoenix hipster:  You really aren't that cool. You just got into riding fixed gear bikes six months ago when anyone that lives in a real city knows it's been the only way to go for years. You just got into "anarchist folk punk" and "psychadelic freak folk" when all the cool kids have moved on to snorting coke and dancing naked in clubs to Yelle. You are behind. You really are not hip. If you lived in a real city (which hopefully Phoenix will become) you would not be considered hip. You would be considered what you are, a stuck up prick.  Sorry for the rant, but that leads me to the reason this is NOT a Seattle style coffee shop. In Seattle, there will be actual "hip" people working at the shop. These people will actually respect culture, art, fashion, design, music, and all the other "cool kid" shit. However, these people do not act above you. I get service when I get coffee in Seattle. In this place, I get treated like I'm not worthy of standing in the shitty old house that looks/smells like the staff cleans it once every six months.  I brought my mom here once after spending a day with her at the art gallery. We wanted to get a quick cup of coffee before I headed back to my apartment and she headed back to Mesa. While ordering the guy working the corner had a stupid smirk on his face the whole time and was rude to my mom and was way too pushy with trying to get her to decide what she wanted. He was making some comments to the girl that was working with him and they would look over at her and I and laugh. Look guys, I'm really sorry I'm not still stuck in teenage-angst mode and working for the local shitty coffee shop at 25. I value my moms time and will not put up with you treating her like shit.   If this was an isolated incident, I wouldn't even take the time to post this review. But this is the consistent attitude of the people that work at this place. I don't know if the management or owners are aware of this (or even worse, are the same way), but they should probably take a look at who they're hiring and the image it promotes about their business. I'm not shocked at all that this place moved to a far shittier location. A place that provides this level of service doesn't belong in such a beautiful neighborhood. Hopefully the historic house can be used for something other than housing a punch of pricks jerking eachother off over their latest 7" scores.   Two stars for the coffee being pretty good whenever I've gone. The coffee is far better at Lux and Drip anyways.

The new store is smaller than the previous one. But it's still a reliable digging source for records. I wish there was a better selection of dance tracks, but that isn't really their thing. They did have the new Chromatics and Glass Candy 12" singles when I was in there last, which was nice.  Great selection of hip hop vinyl, some awesome indie records, etc. Definitely recommend this if you're in the Tempe area.

The 2 Go section of Delux has me going back here after a long time away. I live right across the street now and don't seem to come to Delux as often as I used to when I lived way out in Mesa. The sandwhiches at this place are really awesome, especially the Tuna one. A little overpriced, but always a reliable standby.

One of the better local sushi places. Service is spot on at this place. It's a little small, but there's always a lot of attention paid to every customer in the room. They have a nice small sushi bar you can sit at and watch the chefs prepare your food.  They have a lot of interesting rolls and the sashimi is top quality as well. The prices are pretty low considering the quality of the food here. The dining area is pleasant and well designed. It isn't too loud in here even when the room is relatively full. It's also a nice spot to sit at the bar and have a Kirin and watch whatever game is on behind the bar.   Overall, I can't think of another sushi place that's more reliable in town.

This spot is calm and inviting, hip and moder, and lacking the pretension that can so often ruin a coffee shop. The coffee is fantastic and it's a good spot to spend a couple of hours on a rainy day, as my girlfriend and I did recently. This little stretch of 7th Ave. has become quite the hip little haven for Phoenix.

I decided to go ahead and review this bar again. I'm upping my initial rating of three stars to four. Since the initial review, this bar has gone to great lengths to bring something interesting to do in my neck of the woods each night of the week. I love the live jazz music on Sunday nights. I love the events on First Friday. And most of all, I love the crowd and community that is building in downtown Phoenix that spots like this are helping to foster  I recently took a friend here that lives in Tempe and doesn't venture to Phoenix much.. We tend to go to Casey Moore's often when we're out in Tempe. He compared the Lost Lead to a more sophisticated Casey Moore's. I'd say that's a pretty accurate description. It's inviting and free of pretension, while at the same time bringing that smart and edgy flavor that Phoenix is all about. I love this bar!

This has been a long time coming and is one more huge step in the development of Phoenix as an urban center of the United States.   I have a stop three blocks from my house at Central & Thomas. I have ridden from there to Tempe and it only took about 20 minutes to get there. The stops at each station are very quick and efficient. Everyone is in and out and the train is on it's way again. The ride across the lake is a beautiful way to enter Tempe. From there, it's just a short walk to Casey Moore's and all the other spots I enjoy in Tempe.  The last star is missing from this review because service ends far too early on the weekends. I understand not wanting to deal with the after 2 am crowd, but could we get at least 1:00 am or 1:30 am on the weekends!?

Pizza here is delicious and service is awesome. My favorite pie is the Casablanca minus the mushrooms and add sausage. Delicious!  My food was ready to go when I was told to pick it up, which is something most pizza places can't seem to get right.

This is a great place to see a movie. Big screen, big sound, high quality service and an experience that is lacking at most theaters. Obviously only huge movies can play on this screen, but that goes hand in hand with the costs of running an operation like this. I saw I Am Legend there and was more than happy. It's no Cinerama, but it's close.

This is the new place to be every 1st & 3rd Sunday of the month! Hot Mess begins February 3rd. Two live bands and two dj's each time. No cover and great drink specials.

My new favorite local record store.   They have a great vinyl selection, especially the $1 12" singles. I've picked up a lot of good classic disco 12" releases from West End, etc here on the cheap. The new vinyl is decently priced. I just picked up the new Radiohead record for I believe $12. Another really awesome thing about this record store is the punch card they give you. 1 punch for each $10 you spend, 10 punches gets you $10 worth of free music. A record store certainly doesn't have to give you free music for buying music, you're going to do it anyways. Pretty awesome!  I heard they're going to start hosting shows here on Friday nights. Sounds like I'll definitely have to come in a check this out. If you're a dj, this is essential for the 12" finds. If you just love music, it's essential for everything else. Staff is awesome and friendly as well.
