I was desperately in need of mexican food one day at lunch or else I was going to rip someone's face off... it was just one of those days and luckily I drove by this place.  Definitely 5 stars for Maria, who I gather owns this place, as she was really nice and inviting. I needed to get my food to go, which wasn't a problem and I ordered a carne asade burrito which came with a side of beans and rice - oh I also got a bag of chips and salsa too! That was a plus, especially since I wasn't expecting it.  When I finally got to sit down and eat my food it totally appeased the burrito beast inside me. There was a lot of food and the rice was delicious too. I think I spent around ten bucks...not too bad. Also, just a note - they only accept cards with a $15 minimum so if you plan to spend less than that, bring cash!

Seriously, you might be a little weary coming here but for the love of all things good just go inside and try it! If you can find somewhere to park that is.  You can definitely tell the crowd here is diverse and there are some regular patrons. This place was packed around lunch time and the staff here did an excellent job of keeping the line moving.   I ordered some random combo that came with a taco and enchilada and tried a bit of the chicken quesadilla... freaking delicious. I now know why people come here. Not sure what they're putting in the food to make it so good - could it be love? Haha.

I'm a frequent traveler as well, and I must say - the layout and ease of Phoenix Sky Harbor is far better than most airports I've been to. At first, driving through the terminals were kind of confusing to me but then you get used to it and find out that it's just a big loop. Anyway, I've never had a problem going through security which is a big plus for me. Other airports I've been to (*cough, LAX) could give a rat's ass if people are taking too long or holding up the security line.  The food and entertainment chocies are kind of meh, but all in all - FREE WiFi! If anything, that should be enough to give this place at least 3 stars. Nothing worse than getting stuck at the airport with nothing to do! Sure, I could read a book...but that's not as fun as watching a cool movie on your laptop or phone and have people trying to peek over your shoulder...

Not bad! Anthem Outlets have made some nice improvements over the years I've been coming here. Decent selection of stores, clean bathrooms, food court, and covered parking! I'm really sad that Quicksilver is gone though...oh well!

Don't get me wrong, it's a cute place for families and kids but the parking was a bit unorganized and the prices were a little steep for entrance and all the extras inside. We went for the Pumpkin & Chili party and I couldn't believe what they were charging for the food. I will say that I had a nice evening with the friends I went with even though we seriously almost got lost in the corn maze! It wouldn't hurt to try this place for another event to update my review... until then it gets a 2.5 stars from me!

This is my favorite Chipotle to go to because it's the closest one to my work. I call in orders all the time and the staff always has it ready to go. Even when I don't have a pick up order they always move quickly to get everyone through the line, which is great because when I'm hungry I want everyone out of my way!

Golden Rice Express has become my favorite go-to Chinese restaurant! I was referred here a couple of years ago, and have been going ever since.   It's a small place great for grabbing a quick bite or ordering take out and the food is always ready within 10 - 15 minutes. They also do delivery, but I've never experienced their delivery service since I live close by and am not lazy.   Portions are large, food is really good and authentic, and the prices are cheap. They also get 5 stars from me for their excellent service - the guy who is always there (who I think is the owner) is super nice. I'd recommend trying their chicken with garlic sauce or sesame chicken.

I love this location because it's right on my way to work... I had a breakfast sandwich here once that I wasn't too fond of  so now I just get the regular bagels - the spinach florentine is my fave.   The lines can get kind of long here in the morning, but the staff so far has done a good job not making everyone wait too long. Nothing worse than having employees who don't give a rat's ass, so I'm glad it's not the case here. In fact, everyone has been really nice here always saying good morning and smiling...at least every time I've been here.

I like having a village in close to where I live for times when I'm in the mood for breakfast, but don't feel like cooking it. They've recently updated the place to have kind of a retro/modern feel...new paint, new pictures, new booths - I like it! I don't really like their new logo, but I'm not there to eat their logo so I'll get used to it eventually. Also, they have free wi-fi here if that's important to you.   Food is always good, love their pancakes, and a lot of menu items to choose from. I tried the new chicken ranch sandwich - yums! This place was pretty busy around Saturday 11am. I've heard they have a free slice of pie on Weds type deal, so maybe one of these days I'll check that out.

I've been taking my cars to Purcell for oil changes and check-up for a few years now and I recommend them to anyone in the area. These guys are really good about getting the work done quickly and at a fair price. I like being able to take my car to a place that doesn't try to upsell you at every opportunity or sell you services you don't need.   Also, the last time I went in they were offering a discount program to Banner employees... I don't work there, but I thought it was a pretty good incentive for them!

Always passed this place and finally got around to trying it. Got the white pizza with spinach and it definitely appeased my pizza appetite. Slices are huge and it was made fresh.   Walked in with some friends late one night to order for take out, the guys were cool and had our pizza out in no time. Especially recommended for drunk food.

Oh man the kids that work here crack me up... just because they seem so thrilled to be here (not really). But nonetheless, they're cool kids when you talk to them. It's a small Subway so it can get kinda busy sometimes - especially since it's right across Banner Thunderbird hospital, so you'll see a lot of people in scrubs.  My sandwiches are always consistent here and I haven't encountered any problems yet as far as food quality goes. There are two Subways near me that are the same distance from each other, but I definitely prefer this one over the other location.

I'm a total Starbucks... hell, coffee junkie! I like that this place is small and not too busy. The parking situation can be a bear sometimes since it shares spaces with Einstein Bagels and Blockbuster, but you can park a little across the way if it was really full so it's not extremely bad. Most of the time Starbucks is Starbucks, however I find that sometimes they don't make the drinks here consistently - at times they'll taste really sweet, sometimes too bitter. I guess it depends on how the barista was trained to make the drink. But as long as I get my coffee it's cool...

I only went here because I really wanted Thai food and I live kind of close. This place is in an older strip mall with very kitschy decor which influenced my decision to order my food to go.   The food was good but not enough to keep me coming back, I ordered the pork fried rice and captain rolls. I probably won't try this place again and will just have to plan accordingly the next time I need my Thai food fix.

I really have to base my review on the customer service I received the two times I've been here. The employees were really helpful! I thought the store was really clean and neat... not at all what I was expecting. I'll definitely come back here to shop and I LOVE the sales prices too!

I didn't come here for authentic mexican food, so I was pretty satisfied with my meal. I like hitting up Macayo's everyone once in a while because they have a decent lunch special. It's nice to be able to spend under $10 and have a sit down lunch with friends or coworkers.  I really liked the lunch burro and cisco wrap - I had them at two different times, not all in one sitting...but it's enough to keep me coming back. Ugh, this review is making hungry. I'm done.

So I was too lazy to make dinner and I needed an excuse to have a drink right after work and I decided to go to Outback since I haven't been here in years. I wanted to sit at the bar since it was just a party of two and they have TVs there . The bar area isn't that big but it's a fairly decent size and they have a few booths if you want to order food as well.   Looking at the menu, I noticed that there was some new items and portion options, which was just right because I was hungry but not gluttonous-hungry. And well what do you know? The drinks were pretty cheap too! I don't even think it was happy hour either... awesome.   I ended up ordering one of their 6oz steaks that came with two sides of your choosing (I had a huge bleu cheese wedge salad and garlic mashed potatoes) for under $10. Not bad at all for the portion and the price! Outback, I shall see you again when I feel too lazy again to cook!

Do you know why I like this Subway? No. You don't. So let me tell you... Every time I come in here for lunch it's never busy! And it's not that people don't come in here, it's that the employees are really good about serving their customers. Some Subway locations are pretty hit and miss, but so far this one has been the most consistent.

I...do not...get...it. Why is this place so hyped up? Did I go on an off day? I went here to see what all the buzz was about and I guess I'm still looking for it.  I tried the maguro, shrimp tempura, and the tempura eel roll. It was okay, didn't take me on a mind blowing sushi adventure like I was expecting... and I even had a few sake bombs to start with! Not even that could lift my expectations.   While it wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, it wasn't the worst so I'll give Tokyo Lobby that. I also wasn't too happy that I left still hungry and paid around $40 for my meal.   *siiigh* I promise I'll come back and update my review, I don't want one experience to ruin my opinion of a place that fellow yelpers hold in such high regard...

OKAY. It's official. I went here for lunch yesterday to give this place another try. I don't like to completely write off a place unless I get extremely bad service, but never again Tokyo Lobby! I must be living in crazy town or have the best luck ever going on the two crappiest days for Tokyo Lobby. I'm seriously not understanding what there is to like here.   I ordered a few rolls, one of them were so big in diameter I thought it was a frisbee (not very conducive for dipping or eating for that matter since one bite made everything fall apart) and the sauces on the rolls were way too sweet...I thought maybe they were glazed with candy. And probably the worst roll was one that had too much cream cheese in it! The salmon to cream cheese ratio was out of control! I literally bit into a chunk of cream cheese. I had to drown everything out with wasabi because the water I had tasted weird too. The sad part is I couldn't even finish the meal, not because I was full but because I didn't want to.   The meal was also very overpriced, especially for the quality of food. It's not like I blindly ordered without knowing what I was going to have to pay, but I don't mind paying a bit more for good food -  however this was the nail in the coffin. $45 for a subpar lunch for two people? They can have my money for the last time.

Ugh I didn't go here because of Guy Fieri either, I was actually dragged against my will... and just to let everyone know up front, my review won't be about bbq. I'll save that for an update if I ever feel like coming back here.  Waitress, slow and absolutely hating life. Chili, not that great and too much of a smoky flavor for me personally. And last but certainly not least - the Mac & Cheese. It was awful...just straight from the Kraft box!  And not even made well - too watery, hardly any flavor. To the waitress's credit, she did offer me another type of Mac & Cheese but said that it would take about 30 minutes to make. I would have taken her up on the offer, but I was already hungry and not about to wait a half an hour just to be potentially disappointed again.  So if I ever come back here (big IF) then I will be happy to update my review and I'll even try some of their bbq...it would only be appropriate since this is a bbq place.

My mother and I stopped in to price out rings for her 30th anniversary gift. We were greeted upon walking in and offered water or a cappucino. The customer service was excellent and the salespeople were really nice. If I am ever needing to buy jewelry I'll definitely come back again!

I LOVE SAKANA!   Okay, now that I've gotten that out of the way...this is my absolute favorite sushi spot here in the valley so I'm going to do a little yelp break down on this mofo:  FOOD/DRINK - Excellent sushi! It's fresh, it's tasty, and they've got a nice variety to choose from. Everything from raw to not so raw, and don't forget to look at the specials they have on the board by the bar! Some of my faves are the shrimp tempura rolls & the salmon dynamite. And if you come Sunday - Thursday, they run a customer appreciation special which is some of the specialty rolls except they're smaller & cheaper. I also love going here for the sake bombs - awesome price for the sake & beer you get, and they have a 50 cent appetizer special when you order it with Kirin. (man that sounds so good right about now...) Best of all, you can't really beat the amount of food you get for the price.  SERVICE - The ladies that serve you here are so friendly and they're good at remembering faces when you come back. Yoshie is super nice and you can usually find her walking around to check on everyone, occasionally stopping to chat. I'm always sure to leave a nice tip for the wonderful service.  CUSTOMERS - Weird, right? That I'd be adding a break down for the customers... But  I think they're pretty awesome too! Every single time I come here, I see a lot of regulars enjoying their food & having conversations with the staff. In a time where sushi joints try to be over the top & trendy, it's nice to come to a place that's low-key & you can have an actual conversation. Some people complain about having to wait for a table here, but obviously Sakana is doing something right if they've got people lined up by the door before they are even open! I will continue to come back again & again :)  **On another note - they've recently expanded! Although, this is still a fairly small restaurant at least adding a few more tables will cut the wait time a little more :)

I really like that this place is always busy, but not busy enough for the staff to accommodate you. Every time I've eaten here I've gotten excellent service... and food!   I've mostly tried their pasta dishes and haven't disappointed with any of them so far. If I'm on a (rare) healthy kick I'll order their flank steak salad, which is still awesome. Also love their Italian sodas - Hurricane is my fave.   This is my new place to go for Italian and a definite must-try!

I really like coming to this theater! It's clean, you don't have to wait in super long lines when getting your tickets and the employees are generally pretty helpful. Just make sure that you have your ID handy when watching popular rated R movies... sometimes they card you when you get your tickets and again when you are entering the theater. It's a little inconvenient but I appreciate the discouragement of obnoxious underage teens sneaking in.

This place was...okay. Just okay. Waitress was friendly, nice little place inside. I really have nothing else special to say - the only thing I remember was that my caesar salad was better than most caesar salad's I've had.   I really expected more out of the food - breaded mozarella, fish, artichoke dip...it was all just regular!! Probably won't come back here by choice, especially since there are a handful of other better Italian restaurants that are in the vicinity. Oh well...at least I left full.

I'll start from the beginning... When this place is busy (for some unknown reason) the parking is a nightmare due to the lack of space and the inexperienced drivers. The absolute WORST thing was me witnessing the valet girl stalling someone's car. I really couldn't help but laugh - why would you be valeting cars if you didn't know how to drive stick?!  When you walk in everything is kind of new and trendy looking. I noticed a lot of younger people like to go here so if that's not your crowd then this isn't where you want to be after 7pm. I personally don't like "trendy-young-and-cool" sushi spots. I've only gone for dinner time so I can't speak for what it's like at lunch.   The few times I've been here the sushi wasn't all that great - and I feel I'm a pretty good judge when it comes to the sushi department. I try to give new places a chance so I've been here maybe 3 times. Sushi still wasn't all that, our service always left something to be desired, and the last straw....  I COULD NOT BELIEVE after mediocre borderline poor service, our waitress had THE NERVE to hand me our bill and circle the suggested tip she wrote down. Seriously? I always tip my servers well and accordingly, and a whole lot more when the service is excellent. I rounded out my bill to the next dollar and will never come back here again.

Wow...just thinking about this place and writing a review is making me hungry. I went in here wanting to try something different and ended up getting something amazing! There are a lot of great menu options and I like that they give you a choice to have pita or wrap for your meals.   The interior is actually really nice and it seems like they've got a lot of regular patrons. I can see why since this place is always clean and the staff is always friendly. I'm just glad that I've got another food option when it comes to lunch. I'm even thinking I might go again today :D

The first time I walked in I felt very comfortable but a little nervous - since the reason for my visit was the result of a previous night's drunk bet. I am SO glad that Dana was my piercer that day. He talked me into getting a dermal anchor instead of a surface piercing and explained the pros and cons. The facility was neat and clean and I ended up with shiny new jewelry.   The only reason why I'm taking off a star is because I went back to get another anchor done by another piercer...can't remember his name but he was no where near as friendly as Dana and he hardly said anything to me. I mean, I'm not expecting a whole conversation but he could have at least cracked a smile. I compared this anchor to the one that Dana did the first time and noticed that the post was sticking out of my skin a lot more than it should have. I figured this guy knew what he was doing and thought it would eventually settle in to my skin when it healed.  Nope. It actually came out a couple months later and I had to get it redone. So I went back again to HTC and this time I got CJ. He was awesome! Not only did he redo my anchor properly, but he gave me a discount for having to come back and get it done again. Even though I had that one experience, I still trust the guys at HTC and will come back again.

Went here for a bachelor party last week. I came here with a group of guys, expecting that I had to pay to get in too but they let me in for free so that was nice. It didn't matter cause my cover charge went to one of the girls on the floor anyway. I'd have to agree with the other yelpers and say they definitely have all types of girls here. I'm not lez but some of these chicks were crazy hot.  I'd really recommend getting your pre-game on and drinking before hand, but if there's a large group you might as well buy a table with a couple bottles and have the chickies come to you. I mean they already come to you, though it seemed like they gravitated toward the groups.  I had such a good time here and got the meanest lap dance from a girl... next thing I know I have no money left.

I went here with some friends at 4 odd something o'clock in the morning and ordered the Lucky 7.  And because I remember bits and pieces, I'll focus on the parts I actually do remember.  The service was pretty good, there were lots of people there but we were seated right away. We all pretty much knew what we wanted so they got crackin' on it right away. Probably had one of the best salads with ranch I've ever had in my life...I'm not sure how that is possible, but hey I'm telling you it was an awesome salad. Everything else tasted really good, the only thing was I asked for a medium rare steak and it was a bit too much on the rare side. But at any rate I still left full and happy!  I'm going to make it a point to come back here (sober) the next time I'm in Las Vegas to try out the food again.

The food was really good and the portions were nice for a $12 meal. This place is definitely a dive so I wouldn't suggest taking anyone that is a little "uppity" here. Chino's definitely has some history and wear to it's building, but I have no doubt that the way they handle and prepare their food is clean.  I'm not that adventurous of an eater so it was nice try some samples before deciding what I wanted. The lady was really patient with everyone requesting samples and took the time to show everyone how to "order the Chino way". I ended up getting the emerald chicken, steamed rice, machaca beef, and black beans. Overall, the meal was filling, service was great, and the free cookie certainly helped.

I really wanted to like you Golden Buddha... and not that I didn't enjoy the food (because I enjoyed the hell out of the food), but I have to give you two stars for the service.   It's really a shame because we had about three or four people wait on us since we were a fairly large party and they all were really nice. But one guy messed it up for everyone. Long story short we were gathering the money for the bill, but we didn't want to leave the tip on the table until we were getting ready to leave...however, this guy was really insistent that we give him the tip now. Slighty put off, but still being polite we wanted to make sure we left an appropriate tip - yet he stood there almost demanding that we give him the tip now. *sigh  Anyway, if it wasn't for the awful waiter at the end I probably would have given this place four stars.

I'd like to hug this buffet... It's definitely one of my fave stops when coming to Vegas. I usually go for dinner, but this time I miraculously made it over for brunch after a typical friday night in the city of sin.   I almost wept when I ate the bacon, it was so good...it was either that or I was glad just to be eating. I may even consider coming to brunch - excuse me, attempt to come to brunch - from now on. And do you know what is the beauty of brunch? Breakfast & Lunch! With all the benefits of being able to get dessert after.  I've been coming to this buffet for several years and I'm glad to see they're keeping it looking nice and the food is still really good.

This is basically the closest you can get to have local hawaiian food without actually being in Hawaii. They make everything the way it's supposed to taste like back home - and they even have laulau! A total menu must have if you're going to claim to be a "Hawaiian" restaurant, but since L&L is a Hawaii based chain I wasn't too worried about that!  The regular plate lunch sizes are really big so I always end up getting the mini. Among my favorites are the chicken katsu, roast pork with gravy, manapua, and the saimin.   And as a side note - you might not want to come here if you're trying to watch your weight, Hawaiian food in general is high calorie-laden goodness which is why I always leave this place full and happy!

After many pleas to try  Famous Dave's I finally caved in (sorry but I'm not really a BBQ type of girl). I was pleasantly surprised. We walked in and it look really busy but we were seated right away, so that was really nice. I ordered their bleu cheese burger and it was probably the best bleu I've had! Their wings were pretty good and I loved the different sauces they had at the table - Devil's Spit was my favorite! It was a little tangy, sweet, and spicy with just enough kick. Our server and the staff were very nice so that just added to our positive experience. The next time I come back I'll definitely try some of the BBQ.

This is such a beautiful park! I won't reiterate the amenities most of the other reviews have pointed out, but the rec center is really clean and there's a lot of activities inside as well.

I've been going here for a couple of years now and the doctor and staff here are as nice as can be. I also like that I see the same people every time I come in.  I've never had a problem with ordering my glasses or contacts and the staff is really good at answering any questions you have regarding your plan.  I'm really glad this place is close to me... it sucks driving when your eyes are dilated.

I scheduled a tire install here the other day and could not have been more happy with the service! I originally bought tires somewhere else since a few years ago an employee told me that Discount Tire doesn't match competitor prices. I was helped by Patrick who was genuinely concerned with why I was told that when they in fact DO match prices. Everyone here was really friendly and I got my tires changed out in about 30 minutes. If I ever need to buy new tires again I will come back.

FROZEN CUSTARD? HOLY CRAP THIS TASTES LIKE ICE CREAM!  Actually...I dareth say, it was better than ice cream. Though I also heard a nasty rumor that it is healthier too. Anyway, down to the review - I had the Dirt n' Worms - vanilla frozen custard with oreos and gummi worms. The custard was so good, you don't even realize you're not eating ice cream! I'm definitely coming back to try the food.

These guys did a really excellent job on tinting my car windows. I almost couldn't believe how easy the whole process was. It was also a big plus that they were open on Saturdays. I'd say the hardest part of getting my car tinted was choosing which tint I wanted (and paying). Even so, the price wasn't that bad either.   I basically told them the make and model of my car, set up an appointment and brought my car in. After choosing my tint, the lady told me that it'd take about an hour or so and they would call me. So I left to eat breakfast and what do you know? They called me right as an hour passed. Came back and everything looked great.  It's been a few months since I've had the tint done and I'm still extremely happy with the job they did... I'll probably be a lot more thankful when summer comes around :)

I've been going to "Pac Sea" (that's what the cool kids call it...not really) for a long time, and even though it's quite a trek to go there from Glendale it's always been well worth the trip.  There is such a wide variety to choose from, and the food is always fresh. The short ribs are really good and they make the best cheese wontons I've ever had so far... Also, the staff is really nice too - I've never had bad service the numerous times I've been there. I wish I lived closer!

This is my go to Thai place so far on the west side. Cute little place inside, people are always friendly, and the food is delicious!  Please don't go here looking for Chinese food... There have been a couple times I've overheard people asking them for items you'd see at a Chinese food place - I'm sure they get it all the time and surprisingly they were nice about recommending dishes.   The food is super authentic and so far I've liked everything I ordered. The pork fried rice never disappoints and the larb gai was really good too. Even better is that the bill never hurts my wallet and I usually walk out with my extras I couldn't finish.

#31 steak and brisket pho has been haunting my dreams! I seriously can't stop thinking about it and am constantly craving it. I've tried their other pho combinations and have to say this one is by far my favorite.   I used to come here when this restaurant was super tiny and it always felt so cramped and congested since there was usually a lot of people coming and going either trying to get a seat or picking up orders. This is the first time I've come in after their expansion and it has a little bit of a different feel but the additional space is really nice.   #31, I'm coming back for you!!! (drool)

So this place is a ways away from where I'm at... but the food here was well worth the trip!   I ordered a farm burger with blue cheese and garlic fries... more like awesome burger with awesome fries! I heard that all of the food here was fresh from the farm (hence farm grill) and you can really taste it in their ingredients.   I love the look and feel of the place too - I wish it wasn't so hot outside though, but it was cool to eat at the picnic tables they have set up outdoors. This place is a MUST GO if I am ever near this neck of the woods again.

Personally, I think this place is more hype than anything... I've been here about three times to try different flavors. Let's see - red velvet, chocolate marshmallow, and carrot... all of them were just "meh" to me.   I like how the place looks and how the cupcakes were displayed, also the dog cookies were cute. I probably liked the packaging more than anything.

China Grill made me sad... I was hankering for some good Chinese food and decided to try something new, and I was sadly let down. I will say this - the lady that greeted me at the front was extremely welcoming and nice.  I ordered the crazy hot chicken (which was not so crazy hot), it just had a few jalapenos in it...not that it tasted bad, but it wasn't great and borderline plain. Also was not impressed with the sesame chicken or the super small sides of rice that came with our meal. I really don't mean to sound harsh, but I feel that there are a handful of other Chinese places where you can get better tasting food at a cheaper price.

Super cool place for laid back types... you can tell this place has it's regulars. I loved that it had a diverse crowd and a welcoming environment. The staff was definitely on it's toes for lunch time and they didn't miss a beat!   I heard this was the place to go for breakfast, but since I came here for lunch I ordered the chicken fried chicken sandwich and it hit the spot. I love that this place is tucked away yet seems to not have any trouble getting business. It's pretty close to work so I'm sure I've got a new place to hit up for grabbing a bite to eat.

Due to the abundance of reviews, I will keep mine brief. The service was excellent and I appreciated that the owner personally came by to check on our table. Ordered the famous spaghetti and meatballs and found it to be just okay and wishing I ordered the lasagna, however, everyone else in my party was very happy with what they had. Aiello's is a little far from me, but I wouldn't mind giving this place another try or visiting their other location.

Oh Cracker Barrel I am so upset at how close I live to you! I think it's cute to see the older folks sitting outside on the rocking chairs and playing with their awesome oversize checkers. The little store inside is wonderfully nostalgic and a great distraction for when you're super hungry and waiting. I love getting their pot roast dinner, as for breakfast their pancakes are amazing! They give you a hot bottle of syrup and don't forget to ask for some apple butter!

Just wanted to get my pre-game on and grab some drinks after picking someone up from the airport so we came here... seemed okay at first, then it went downhill after our server started talking.  Not that he was rude or anything, he looked like he came into work hungover and he really didn't seem to know what he was doing anyway. I asked him for some hefeweizen and he told me he didn't know what that was. Chips and salsa weren't that great either. Uh...next.

Not bad... I admit I had some preconceived notions, but happy hour and a couple rounds of sake bombs certainly helped with that. I'm reviewing this on my drinking and entertainment experience since I didn't really order food.   I really liked the setup of this place and the indoor/outdoor layout, there was a nice size crowd on a Thursday night too. I was actually surprised that this place was a lot smaller than it looked in the pictures on their website, but I didn't feel crowded or anything so it wasn't much of an issue. I've gotta agree with Erin G. though, I'm sure that random rock in the middle is there to trip up the drunkies!  Also, I wasn't planning on doing karaoke at first, but if you're going with a good size group of friends, throw down some money to get a room. They had a huge book of song selections and it comes complete with a disco ball and pole, which means good times are to be had for all!  I'm not usually in this area, but it seems like a cool place to meet up with people and have a few drinks...it'll definitely give me an excuse to try the food if I'm ever back here.

I love this place! Especially since they added the Hawaiian section. Most people would be skeptical, but the meat selection and quality here is really good and their produce prices are awesome.  I'd also have to say that their alcohol selection is wonderful - more often than not, alcohol (especially beer) ends up being cheaper here. The thing I like most is the nice ladies that work here at the cash register... there's always a lane open or a short wait, and I'm not sure if they do it all the time but usually they give a 10% discount even when you don't show them your Lee Lee's card. And if anything else, just come here to try something new - like mochi ice cream (freezer section)!

I'm so mad at myself for being so close to this place, but never had the opportunity to check it out until just recently. I absolutely LOVE coming here for their lunch specials. $8.99 for miso soup, spicy tuna roll, and shrimp tempura roll? Heck yes! It's such a great alternative to eating fast food for lunch when you are essentially paying the same price. I've already been here 3 times within a couple weeks of my first visit!

So I'm not usually an urban-pizzeria+wine-bar type of girl, BUT I really  enjoyed La Bocca! It's a nice laid back spot for meeting friends, dinner dates, girls night outs, and those sort of things that dimly lit atmospheres usually foster.   I tried a few of their appetizers with a couple of glasses of sangria and liked it all. I'd definitely come here if I lived closer. This place is pretty busy so make sure you prepare accordingly if you're coming with a sizable group.

I admit I was a tad nervous to try this place out since I read a few of the recent reviews. I always take yelper opinions into account, but I do like to give a business the benefit of the doubt - and in this case I'm glad I did!  Now I'm no pho expert, but I just wanted pho SO badly the other day and said F@#! IT let's try a new place! I ordered the pho with rare beef slices and brisket. OH. MY. Not only did it satisfy my pho craving, it instantly became my new favorite pho place so far. I can't wait to try more menu items and will certainly come back with an update!

This place really surprised me... I normally don't like hipster sushi restaurants but I came here the first time on a recommendation and wasn't disappointed. The food was actually a lot better than I expected.  It's really nice inside, I love the lighting and decor plus the view of the Westgate fountains is kind of cool. As Faith A. mentioned in her review, I expected to pay a lot more than what I did for my dinner + alcohol...that's a plus!  Last year I celebrated my birthday here with a party of 20 people (originally invited 12) which kind of worried me because they don't accept reservations on the weekend, but they had no problem accommodating us when the tables became available. The servers were really cool with our large party and even gave me some birthday drinks on the house! Then after that I couldn't really remember... OH and like everyone says - the bathrooms are cool and disorienting... but not fun after you've had a few sake bombs.

Met some old coworkers here to have a few drinks and appetizers for happy hour - it was my first time coming here and I was pleasantly surprised! It had a great atmosphere, beautiful interior, and it wasn't too busy like I thought it would be for happy hour.   At first I was a little disappointed that they didn't have any hefeweizen, but our server suggested I try hoegaarden (I childishly giggled at the name) - and ended up loving it. Also tried both of their combo platters which was enough for 4 people to share and be full. I'm not too sure what I ate but it was all really good!      Definitely a place to try when you want to switch things up. I'm sure I'll be back here soon.

I love the hell out of some steak! That being said, I'm giving this place 4 stars for their food and the extra star by itself for their service.   I went here with a group of friends for their birthday dinner (a party of 10) which was not a problem at all. The restaurant was very nice and at the risk of being cliche and corny - had a great dinner ambiance. It's not too dimly lit and tables are far away enough for you to have some space with your party. I've been cursed with excellent hearing and being easily distracted with background noise, which means I can usually pick up on couples fighting at their dinner table right away. Though it can be quite entertaining, it is also very annoying.   The food was excellent and our entire party enjoyed their meals as well. I ordered a bruschetta appetizer, caesar salad, and the top sirlion with garlic mash. Our server was excellent and very attentive to our party...then to top it off they gave the birthday guest free dessert along with a birthday card from the staff. It was a small gesture, but certainly appreciated! I will definitely come back here.

Took someone here this weekend for a birthday dinner on saturday - it was pretty busy, but we were fortunate to find an open seat at the bar. This BJ's seemed a little smaller than the Chandler location, but that didn't really bother me. Our service was good and the bartender was really chatty though I didn't mind.   Started off with some Hefeweizen, clam chowder sourdough bowl for appetizers, and some BJ's deep dish pizza for dinner. Food was really good, servers were nice, so I'd definitely come back again.

My first experience here wasn't bad at all, but we were just having beers and watching "the game". It was pretty busy, but we found a place to sit at the bar. Lots of TVs. Girls are really nice. Cool. Solid 3 stars.   However, this last visit was really irritating! The food was not that great - the french dip was pretty bland, and the garlic fries were just soggy but at least had some flavor. The worst part is that the service was waaaay too slow and there were maybe 15 - 20 people dining in the restaurant at the time. So this time around, they are averaging a 2 for me. If I ever come back, it'll just be drinks and the TVs!

I almost passed up this gem while picking someone up from getting their car worked on in a shop right across from Rainbow Donuts... yes it is in an odd location, but do not let that deter you! I swear, I think my donut radar was going off because it was early in the morning and I caught the slightest glimpse of the word DONUTS...actually I only saw the D & the O and just went from there. So I busted out my handy Yelp app and found out this place had a couple of 5 star ratings - yes!  The nice lady behind the counter informed me that I had just missed the huge morning rush so all of the "good" donuts may be taken... fortunately, I'm a plain glazed donut kind of chick. You can get a dozen of the donut holes for a buck and some change so I grabbed a couple of those, some coffee, and I was good to go!   Good donuts and awesome price. Next time I stop by...Ninja Bowl, I'm coming for you!

I almost cried when I left... #1 - I was full and couldn't eat anymore and #2 I was full and couldn't drink anymore.  I've been to many a buffet in my lifetime and this was one of the best. The main reason was the beer and wine was INCLUDED with the buffet, one drink at a time of course!   I went for dinner time and paid what I expected for a vegas buffet, somewhere around $30. The place is beautiful and new, the setup was fairly maneuverable, and the food was freakin good.   Studio B had an excellent range of dishes - from american, sushi, soups, italian, and even...hawaiian food! And as a hawaiian person, I approved of the poke and kalua pig. I ate so much food that I didn't even have room for dessert...what a shame.   This place is officially my new buffet spot! Now I just need an excuse to go back to Vegas...

Dos Gringos was a pretty cool place to grab a beer with and chill with some friends. It wasn't packed or anything but there was still a lot of people inside - which was okay because the place was big enough to where you weren't bumping against people while trying to get around.  Lots of TV's inside and plenty of tables and places to sit. I liked that the music was loud, but not blasting so you were able to carry on a conversation on the outside patio if you wanted. I didn't get to eat here, so this review is based solely on the establishment and atmosphere!

I'm usually skittish about trying new chinese food places, but we decided to try it out and grab some take out since we were in the area. I'm happy to report this place was a great choice!  We ordered the curry chicken, sesame chicken, and the mongolian beef - all were very delicious! I really liked the flavors, portions were more than enough so that we had a lot of leftovers. (I LOVE leftover chinese food!) I'd order here again!

Carolina's West is as every bit as good as the original Carolina's! Including the price for the amount of food you get, and you can actually find a parking spot at this location...  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they had a west side location, especially after trying the original spot. I questioned myself if the food was really that good for how far I'd have to drive. The answer was a resounding YES, and I almost flipped a table over when I discovered Carolina's accommodated the west side! Yay!

My review is based strictly on this place as a bar, as I've never eaten here.  It's usually crowded on the weekends and for some odd reason they (staff/bar dancers) like to throw tons of napkins in the air, which is probably cool to the many intoxicated dancers on the floor.The problem is the napkins get all over the floor and mixed in with the spilled drinks, so now everyone is stepping on the napkins and they're getting stuck to everyone's shoes. Music is okay, the layout is pretty cramped... I don't ever go here by choice, only when a group of people I'm with want to.

I noticed this cupcake shop by chance, as it is kind of off to the side on the bottom floor by the two-story Forever 21. The shop is really small but there's a big pink sign you can't miss. First off, the service was excellent and my boyfriend and I were greeted right away by the two guys who were there and they were awesome.   Sugar Daddy's has a nice selection of flavors, though the two that really caught our eye were the Captain Crunch and Red Velvet. I loved how the cupcakes were decorated and even got to see one of the guys frosting a couple. We decided to buy both of the flavors we were looking at and they were amazing. I also agree that this place is way better than Sprinkles. The cupcakes are moderately priced and really big. I'm so happy to have such an awesome cupcake place on the west side. I highly suggest everyone to give this place a try!

I've made it my sole mission to bring all of my friends & family to Sugar Daddy Cupcakes! I've even taken these babies all the way to Vegas on a special request...although half of what I bought didn't survive the drive there.   I'm telling you, this place is that GOOD & the dudes are awesome! Of course, so are their cupcakes. My default is always the red velvet, and when it is available, the captain crunch one is a fave too!   For you healthy jerks out there, they've got really good tea as well...but really stop flaunting your healthiness and just try one of their cupcakes. It's well worth the guilt. Just remember that this place is on the first floor near the Forever 21 - I'd hate for you to get exercise and walk all over the mall just trying to find this place.

For some unexplained reason, I was really hungry and just had to stop by the nearest place to eat. I haven't been to an IHOP in almost ten years so I figured, why not? I really wanted pancakes since it IS the International House of Pancakes, but it was close to dinner time and wanted something really filling.  I'm not sure if this location is new, but it sure looks like it the way everything was kept and clean. Everyone was really nice - from the host to the server. I ordered the pot roast sandwich which ended up being a really good choice, however I wasn't a fan of their french vanilla coffee. But all in all, I left full and my hunger was appeased.

I went in here for dinner just to check it out since it was new. I must say, it really felt like a family bistro. The inside was nicely decorated in an Italian theme with painted walls... almost like a mini, more intimate Olive Garden. Their motto is "A bit Italian with a Mediterranean twist".  I ordered the calamari, which was thick and juicy, along with their garlic fries. The fries were just regular steak fries with chopped garlic, but nonetheless good. I also tried a bolognese pasta with sausage in it - overall I'd say the food was good but not mind-blowingly over the top. They had a nice selection of entrees as well as a little wine bar, so I'd like to come back and try more. Dinner for two only cost me about $25 including tip...and I tip well.   I'd recommend coming here for lunch or dinner when you're in the mood for Italian food in an intimate family type atmosphere. Most importantly, I would really like to give it up for their EXCELLENT customer service! There was a young guy going around and talking to everyone to see how their meal was and we made some small talk and he handed me a little card that was good for a free appetizer the next time I come in. Better believe I will be coming back for my free appetizer.

Cheap. Fast. Good. It's Filiberto's! The only downside is coming here late at night when all the drunk idiots hold up the line. Even though it's funny to hear you slur your order it's not funny when you and the 4 people plus the one that's not wearing a seat belt take too damn long to order.

They shut down the old Krispy Kreme in this area and for a while I mourned the loss... though my arteries thanked me.   *sigh.. SO I guess they decided to open one up a new one in an even more convenient location (right across the movie theaters) - so now when you come out of a movie and you haven't gotten enough over-priced popcorn, soda, and movie nachos, you can just walk across and buy a dozen donuts you don't need. Because you will buy a dozen. Like I did...  But whether you just got out of a movie or are actually planning to get donuts, it's worth it to stop in and hang out for a bit. You can see the people behind the counter making the donuts and there is actually a little milk/coffee bar. Oh, and be sure to pick up a Krispy Kreme hat for the kiddies.

Went here for my first time with a coworker for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered off their value menu which ranged from $1 to just under $2. I got a salad, chicken leg, and a small taco for around $3 - not a bad price, especially if you're low on funds or just cheap.  The people were really friendly and had our orders out right away. I liked that they had a little salsa bar with lemons and peppers that you could take to go... not a bad option for a nice quick lunch!

This Taco Bell/Long John Silvers is awesome! My coworkers and I frequent this location pretty often and we always get good service, our food is made quickly, and the workers here are nice. I'd have to say this is probably the cleanest Taco Bell I've ever been to. If I'm going to eat food that's kinda bad for me, I'd at least like to have a pleasant experience doing so...

I've never had bad service here and I actually enjoy eating here for lunch because the only wait is the line. My sandwich is always ready within 2-4 minutes of when I order it.   I like the staff cause they always seem to be in a good mood and they normally play good rock/alternative music. Although, one day they were playing that annoying Friday song by Rebecca Black and some teeny pop crap... manager must have been out that day. Whatever, food was still good!

Yay! Now I don't have to go all the way down to Chandler for Pacific Seafood! I'm a little late with this review....but let me tell you, I was ecstatic when I drove by on Bell and saw the "Opening Soon" sign on the building. I loved the Chandler location, but hated making the trek!  Glendale Pac Seafood has everything the Chandler one does, except this one is nicer, newer, and super clean! Be careful on going on Friday evenings...this place gets packed, so I'd recommend getting take-out if you're just wanting to grab a quick meal.

I love coming here when it comes to party planning and decorating. It's a nice size store so they have quite a bit of stuff to choose from. Most of it is organized into different sections according to event type, holiday, etc. The employees are pretty cool and the few times I've been in here they add extra staff to help out around the holidays when it gets busy. I really like that this place is kept neat and fairly organized so that you aren't stepping over things or rummaging through different sections to find what you need.  I recently came here looking for little toys and pencils for kids gift bags I was making and was happy to find everything I needed and more! Party City has tons of cool little toys and favors as low as .25 a piece. A nice feature they have is to email your receipts - it's good to have, especially if you're picking up items for work that have to be submitted for reimbursement. Can't wait to come here for the next party I have!

Rocket Fizz is an awesomely nostalgic candy/soda store! I just went in there to browse around but ended up getting a whole bunch of candy that I used to eat as kid. I even saw a pack of Big League Chew...wth, I thought they stopped making that? They also have a huge assortment of bottled soda, so be sure to ask the super nice person at the register for soda punch card.   This is a great place to pick up novelty candies or even just to have a look around. Even more awesome, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was playing on the TV.

This is a great alternative to your "regular" sub sandwiches if you're in the mood for something else. My favorite is the roast beef. It can get a little busy in here around lunch time so I always get mine to go in case there isn't available seating. I'd recommend any to try it at least once, though I've been back here a few times!

This is a nice park and I agree with the previous reviewer that the grounds are very well maintained. I attended a wedding here in their rose garden. The rose garden was a lot smaller than what I expected, but the overall area was a great place to do a wedding. I like that they have chickens roaming around, we got to see a mother hen and her chicks following her around... very cute!

YESSIR! It's a shame (or a blessing) this place isn't close to me... The people here are super friendly and the food is on point!  Had the mac and cheese bites... pretty much made me want to slap someone in the face because of the fried cheesy goodness. My favorite flavors so far are the seasoned and parmesan garlic wings!

I HATE THIS PLACE...  because I can't resist it. It's bad enough that I f-ing love coffee, they go and make it taste super good - wtf. Every single damn time I pull up to this place every one is smiling and happy and always asking you how you're doing...unheard of! Seriously though these kids are awesome and always make me leave in a happier mood (plus having the coffee in hand).  I swear to you, one time they gave me the wrong drink (unbeknownst to me) and I got all the way to the stoplight to see one of the baristas full on running to my car like he was getting chased by a bear just to give me the correct drink. Ah-maz-ing.   They have a ton of specials, great customer service, fantastic drinks, and if you don't know what to get they'll be more than happy to find one you'll be sure to like. 5 stars hands down.

I'm happy to have more boba options on this side of town! I ordered the ice blended taro boba and it was just what I needed. I know I'll be coming back, especially when it gets hotter outside with the summer coming up! I'll be interested to see how some of their other flavors taste.

Combination chicken fast food joint and gas station? Yessss! It's so convenient when I need to fill my car and my stomach! Joking aside this Popeye's isn't bad. Pretty much what you expect if you like their chicken. All of the workers seem really nice here too, they normally let you know if they have any specials but I would be sure to ask them just in case. And while you're waiting for your food you can just pop in the gas station store (they're connected). If not, they also have a drive-thru.

So one of the downsides to owning a place... you pay for anything that breaks! I had (what ended up NOT to be an emergency) for the kitchen sink. Right in the middle of cooking dinner, water starts coming out from the cabinets underneath. Great. I'm hungry and now I'm irritated...  We actually called another handyman for a referral and he suggested we call these guys - specifically Howard. I wasn't too sure if I'd be able to get someone out right away, but Howard was the man and made it happen! We called him around 6pm and he showed up shortly after.   He was very knowledgeable and really upfront about how much everything would cost. All around nice guy :) I'm very sure I'll be calling him if we ever need any other plumbing services... hopefully not any time soon!
