We had Exceptional service by a young lady named Jess, she did a Great job when all else around her seemed to be going haywire! The Burgers were good, I had the Blue Ribbon burger & my lady had the Whiskey river burger, I can say they were outstanding!  We went to the one off of Chandler Blvd, our table was clean, service was excellent, food hot and on time. Also I like the new table gadget where you can order your food, pay your check and write a good or bad review. We wrote a good one, if you are looking for a good burger and excellent service when you get to Red Robin ask for Jess, she will hook you up!

Been here several times in the past & it feels like it suddenly fell off a cliff. This is not the place to eat anymore.  Ordered one fish taco & 2 beef tacos, drive thru rep was abrupt & very Short when ordering. I know it is not a nice place but a hello and how can I help you would be nice. So, lets get to the food, fish tacos, under cooked & not tasty, beef tacos totally skimpy on the beef & full of lettuce. Next time I will check Yelp for reviews, they have always pointed us in the right direction!

My Lady & I were looking for a good place to grab some pizza. We stopped in to Barros & were amazed by the service. The building is very nice & atmosphere was great! Ordered the all meat pizza, switched out the bacon for chicken & let me tell you it was awesome, we ate till our hearts where content. Woke the next morning n ate cold pizza straight out the fridge, now that is when you know you got some good pizza! Keep up the good work Barros!
