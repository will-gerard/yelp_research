At about 12 o'clock this afternoon I was thinking to myself "I want some pizza for lunch where should I go?"  "Barro's!" I screamed outloud in reply to my own question. So I borrowed $5 from my old lady and off I went.  I got the lunch special. Two slices of pepperoni pizza and a drink. I threw down the extra cash to get a side of ranch for dipping. Best decision of the day.  This location is a little far away from where I stay but it's worth the drive. Super clean place. Friendly staff. The girl at front counter is always nice. I don't know her name but she has a tattoo on the back of her neck. Thanks, neck tattoo girl! I'll be back tomorrow.

Man, I love baseball. Sometimes going to a game can get expensive so I stick to the value menu. A buck fifty for a hot dog? I'll take five please.  Kettle corn, pretzels, nachos, and frozen yogurt helmet sundaes. At Chase Field they've got it all but bring some cash because a lot of the vendors are prehistoric and don't take plastic.  During the 4th inning, I always head to the upper deck to get an autograph from the D-Backs mascot, Baxter. They say it's just for kids but he doesn't seem to mind.

Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember.  I'll always remember lunch at Chino Bandido. I got the carnitas burrito, you got the Chinese BBQ pork quesadilla. We shared a fountain drink with no ice. The whole experience was really nice.  Then we stood at your car door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it.

As soon I found out we would be staying at the Mirage, I had my heart set on hitting up the Carnegie Deli.  Right after we arrived, I walked up to the to go counter and ordered the Woody Allen. This sandwhich was HUGE! After carrying it back to my room, I felt like I had just done some high intensity reps at the gym.  Don't let the $20 price tag scare you. It was worth every penny.  Service was a little slow and rude but hey it's a New York-style deli. What else would you expect?

When the only thing that will satisfy my hunger is a really good salad, I go to Paradise Bakery. My only complaint with this location is that if you order your salad to go, expect the plastic container to only be half full. This doesn't happen at the other locations I've been to. On the plus side, the cookies are buy one get one free.

I've been taking the lil dude here since he got his first haircut. He picks out a movie, sits right down, and gets to business. The girls who work here are nice and efficient. It makes for a pleasant experience all around. Way better than Fantastic Sam's or some other corporate chain. Stay away from the suits and support this place.

Don't tell anyone but I have a weakness for McDonalds Chicken McNuggets. Today I ordered myself a ten piece and a large order of french fries. After I paid, the guy at the second drive thru window said I needed to park and wait for the fries. I said no thank you and left.

Open your mouth and say hello to my brand new favorite pizza.  I've been going to Uncle Sam's at least once a week lately. Sometimes I get the wings. Sometimes I get a cheese steak. Sometimes I get pizza. Thanks to the bailout menu, sometimes I just go ahead and get all three.  Five stars for the friendly staff and the Ms. Pac-Man machine in the lobby.

Wednesday night is kids night. Great time to pick up on single moms. Plus I love their lemonade.

Do you like waffles? Yah we like waffles!  Do you like chicken? Yah we like chicken!  But this place was uninspiring. I just felt like I could have accomplished the same thing by getting a box of Eggos and some KFC. Didn't live up to the hype at all. The waffles were too mushy and were served to us luke warm. The chicken tasted no better than what you get from the grocery store deli.  Bon app√©tit!

Josef was very confrontational when I didn't accept his offer on detailing. I didn't let nobody stare me down in jail, homeboy. You think I'm going to let it fly at a car wash?  I won't be coming back.

Sometimes I put on my best Hawaiian shirt and go to Leo's. I get their lemon pepper chicken and dip it in the katsu sauce. It's not really a traditional move but I play by my own set of rules. The staff is super friendly. If you ask nicely they might even let you substitute the cabbage for an extra side of macaroni salad. It's a risky move but if it pays off, you'll be in pasta heaven.

I was stoked to check this thing out. We bought the VIP package for Sunday and got to hang out with Adam Richman from Man V Food. Each ticket included 6 free alcoholic drinks, $20 worth of food tickets, and free appetizers. I ate so much pizza from Pizza People I couldn't stand up. Maybe it was the alcohol and not the pizza. My memory is a little hazy.

I'm not sure when Planet Hollywood shot glasses and VHS tapes became antiques. If that's what you are looking for than this is the place for you.

Yep, I had a salad for lunch today. A nice manly, Southwest Chicken Caesar salad. I threw the girls at this new Paradise Bakery location a curveball and ordered the large with two chocolate chip cookies to go. They hit it out of the park. My plastic salad container was filled to the max. Plus it had tons of spicy, chipotle caesar dressing. Just the way I like it.

Dude! This place is now open! No more taking the bus down to Camelback just to get a pizza cookie. I could eat their thin crust all day. Now that it's close, I'll probably do that tomorrow.
