I wasn't completely sure what to expect when I went to the Heard Museum, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed myself.  We were there for almost 2.5 hours and the time flew by.  The permanent exhibit was laid out nicely and I truly learned quite a bit that I did not know previously about Native Americans.  In fact, I had no clue how many different tribes call Arizona and New Mexico home and reading the history and how they are now was quite fascinating, but I am a history nerd. The Remix contemporary exhibt was well-done and was my favorite portion of the whole museum, but I'm a sucker for contemporary art and installations.  We even wondered about the "children's area" and that was also well done with a variety of hands on crafts and activities for little peanuts (heck, my husband and I even did some of them! hehe).   The boarding school exhibit on the second floor was very nicely done and well laid out...the testimonials that played while you walked around were quite touching and at times I felt myself tearing up.  Adult admission is $10 and students are only $5. My husband forgot his ASU student ID and when he mentioned it to the cashier, the guy was like, "oh that's OK" and gave us the student admission anyway. Very nice.  There were quite a few people at Heard while we were there, but I never felt rushed or that I was in someone's way, which I think speaks highly of the layout.  I definitely recommend the museum if you have an afternoon you are looking to fill and/or just want to learn more about Native Americans.

I've never been to Majerle's before a game, so this is purely a review based on numerous weekday lunch experiences. First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.  Other than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.  Prices are decent considering the proximity to US Airways Arena and Chase Field.  Overall a good lunch spot to grab a beer and get my sports fix, but not somewhere that warrants a special trip. I'll have to check it out before a game sometime to get the full effect.

Paisley Violin has been on my list of places to try for lunch for awhile and finally I made it there last week with some co-workers. Like many places in Phoenix, it is small with limited parking. However, there is ample street parking and from the looks of it, tables and chairs on a patio which my group would have been fine with had it not been a yucky day out. As soon as we walked in, I knew I was going to love Paisley Violin. The exposed brick walls, the random pieces for sale, a small bar, and posters for live music and movie nights all give Paisley Violin a cute atmosphere and vibe.  We had the pesto brie as an appetizer and I was shocked to learn that one of my dining companions had never had such a combination before! The bread had seasoning on it which gave the cheese and pesto a nice kick when all three combined in your mouth. The portion size was perfect for the four of us to share and left us plenty of room for our lunch. As my main meal, I had the Mediterranean eggwich which was tasty; however the only disappointing factor was that I had asked for no red onions and when my sandwich came out, it had red onions on it. Two of my other dining companions both had the BLT with a side of potato salad and they both were raving over the sandwich and potato salad when we left. As one of my coworkers said, the chipotle mayo took what would have been an ordinary BLT to another level. Drinks are served in plastic cups and remind me of the glasses my parents would have bought when we were kids. It was quirky and an interesting touch. If you order a soda, it comes out in an old fashioned bottle, so there are no free refills. That is fine with me because it actually limits how much I drink!  Our bill was approximately $10-12 per person (before tip) which is pretty much on par with most places we frequent for lunch. Future trips to Paisley Violin are definitely in store!

For me, Paradise Bakery is a poor man's Panera. I don't think it's nearly as organized, friendly or tasty as Panera, although the price is much better at Paradise.  Paradise Bakery is disappointing in a few ways. First, I really really hate when places just have pictures of sandwiches on the display board and provide absolutely zero written description. Oh, I see I'm just supposed to guess what is on that sandwich that has a picture in the most inconvenient spot in the whole freaking place. Wonderful. Second, the caesar salad is horrible. I took my first bite yesterday and instantly remembered why I swore I would never order another one from Paradise again. I managed to choke most of it down, but seriously what is wrong with their caesar dressing??? It has a very funny, and not in a good way, taste to it. Also the croutons are not very tasty either. Third, they completely use too much dressing on their salads. Excuse me, but can I have some lettuce to go with that dressing?? And finally, for a bakery, I don't particularly find the cookies and pastries I have tried to be all that amazing. The chocolate/white chocolate chip cookie I tried yesterday was a bit on the dry side and not very chewy/soft at all. Boo.  The two bright spots are 1) the price...my salad and medium drink was $6.23 which isn't a bad deal at all and 2)the number of tables outside this location where you can escape the office to enjoy a nice, leisurely lunch on a beautiful Arizona day. But if you are craving a salad or sandwich, there are better options in the downtown area.

I've ate at OSF twice now and it was two times too many. Both times service has been horrible. I get that working the lunch shift may not be lucrative, but yesterday I was with a group of approximately 15 and our waiter was incredibly rude and disinterested in serving us. He was banking on the fact that he would get an automatic 18% from each of us, which is unfortunate because for good service I will tip more. Beyond the lousy service, the food is not good. I had the fettucini alfredo the first time I ate at OSF and it was drowning in alfredo sauce...yuck. The salad looks like something you get from a bag. Yesterday I ordered a caesar salad as my entree. First, it had tomatoes in it. I really don't like tomatoes in caesar salad. Second, our waiter brought it out with the other salads. So that meant that when my group got their entrees, I had nothing and basically had to watch them eat. Since when were entree salads brought out with starter salads??? Lastly the wine selection is pathetic. There are only two white wines by the glass and the Riesling I had yesterday was much too sweet.   For generic Italian food, go to the Olive Garden. At least their salad and breadsticks are decent.

I am in love...with Zoe's grilled feta sandwich. Everytime my co-workers and I go for lunch, I always tell myself I am going to try something else on the menu...and then I don't because I don't want to cheat on the grilled feta. My sandwich is always toasted perfectly and the tomato on the sandwich helps tone down the feta just a touch. The pasta salad is my favorite of the sides to get. I tried the potato salad once and was not wowed by it at all. For almost $9 which buys a drink, sandwich, side and chips, I always leave contently full.  As a warning, if you don't like feta cheese, this may not be the place for you. About 99% of the items on the menu contain it.

The search is over...I have found my favorite wine bar in the Valley!   Comfortably situated on Central Avenue slightly south of McDowell, it's a quiet, chic space that I think will be tremendously helped out once light rail opens in a few months. The wine list is nice and covers a wide range of palattes. I've had the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc before which was good, and also had a glass of another white whose name escapes me. The second white I had was poured for me by the very friendly bartender Jeff...I told him what kind of wine I liked and he hand-selected one for me to try. It's not on the "wine by the glass" menu, so he opened the bottle and poured me a glass. I love when places do that!  The beer list while small has all of my favorite imports, so thumbs up on that as well.  The first time I dined at Cheuvront was for dinner and my friend and I started with the Brillat Savarin which was creamy and very much like brie...it was delicious. I loved how the server asked if we wanted more baguette when she saw we were running low because we still had a lot of cheese left.  I felt that the one cheese plate was a perfect size for two people to split as an appetizer. For dinner I had the caesar salad which was light and the perfect meal for a warm spring day.  I took a bite of my friend's Pizza Chevre which was really good and hearty.    I most recently dined at Cheuvront for lunch today with a group of friends. Our waiter was incredibly pleasant and even though the menu said they do not split checks, he was very nice about running two credit cards and breaking cash to make change.  Everyone at the table seemed very pleased by what they ordered. I had the macaroni and cheese which comes with a side salad. The mac and cheese was the perfect lunch sized portion and the salad was light and crispy.  Prices are very reasonable for both wine and food.  Cheuvront is a great spot for lunch, dinner, or just to sit at the bar and try a new wine or two.  I know I will be there in the future especially with Kristin S. moving so close to it!

Very similar to the Hard Rock Cafe in terms of atmosphere and types of food served but without the Hard Rock prices and better food.  Plus, like Hard Rock, you can buy t-shirts and souvenirs.    A group of co-workers and I decided to go there for lunch since four of the five of us hadn't been there before. It seemed like quite a popular lunch destination as almost the entire inside was full. We were seated promptly and had a very nice server.  The menu includes your standard sports bar appetizers, wings, salads, and sandwiches.  There is even a small "low carb" section, with some very tasty sounding wraps.  I ordered the BLT and my bacon came out pretty crispy for the most part, as I requested. I liked how the bread wasn't toasted, but grilled, and my crispy fries were delicious.  I appreciated how the sandwich size was reasonable (you know, so it actually fit in my mouth) and I received a nice side of fries, but not too many. Portions appeared to be very reasonable.  With the sandwiches and burgers, you get a choice of two sides, but I only got the fries. Smart move on my part, as two sides would have been too much food for me.  My one co-worker ordered off the kids menu and our waitress was totally fine with that.  For the five of us, our bill came to $52, which is very very reasonable.  I can see how this is a popular destination before Diamondback or Suns games...plenty of TVs dot the restaurant so regardless of where you are sitting, you have an easy view of at least one TV.  Service was quick despite a pretty full restaurant (we were in and out in well under an hour). Street parking was a tad tricky as most of the meters this afternoon were unavailable to park at (not sure why). But if you are going before a game, parking won't be an issue.  The heavy eyeliner on the servers and hostesses was a bit much for me, but fits in the overall theme of the restaurant I suppose.  All and all a good choice if you work downtown and are looking for a lunch place or before a sporting event.  Not sure I would make a special trip to eat here though.  UPDATE (4/20/08):  I have been to Coopers Town a few times since my initial review, most recently today before a Diamondbacks home game. Based on my subsequent experiences after my initial review, I have bumped up my star rating to 4 stars. I have tried a few more things on the menu and I highly recommend the crispy chicken wrap...it is delicious! The atmosphere at Coopers Town before a game is awesome and is a great spot to hit before a game. Plus how can you go wrong with $3 Bud, Bud Light, and Amber Bock drafts on home game days for the Suns and Diamondbacks?

My husband and I met some friends at Coronado Cafe today for lunch before venturing to the Heard Museum. I'd driven by Coronado quite a few times on my way to Lisa G's for lunch and had been wanting to try it, and boy am I glad we finally did! It was a great lunch place...quite a nice selection of salads and sandwiches.  Plus, any place that has $5 glasses of wine is A-OK in my book. I ordered the half chicken caesar sandwich and a small field salad...both were delicious...my half sandwich was huge, so I was glad I hadn't ordered the full one.  The chicken was nice and moist and the caesar dressing had a hint of spice, which was a nice surprise.  My husband ordered a burger and thought it was delicious...he said it's the best burger he has had in quite a while.  It was a tad small inside, but it was a cute and charming restaurant, so I barely noticed how close we were to the tables next to us.  I'm definitely telling my co-workers about Coronado, so we can add it to our lunch rotation. Coronado Cafe is 10 times better than Lisa G's (a place one of my co-workers insists on going frequently), which is right down the street.  The brunch menu looks quite good, so I'm going to drag my husband back on a Saturday morning sometime to try it out.

Another place that is really serene and makes you forget you are in a large city! I really liked the Desert Botanical Gardens and I am totally not into flowers or botany!  We had been to DBG once before for Luminarias, but it was so dark that we couldn't see much. I'm glad we returned in the daylight.  We took my inlaws yesterday after brunch and they absolutely loved DBG. My father-in-law is totally into photography, so DBG was awesome for him. We saw tons of people with cameras, so it is a photographer's haven.  I really had no clue there were so many types of cactus. There are hands on activities scattered throughout (probably for kids on field trips) and boards with information, which comes in handy on the Sonoran Desert Trail when you want to figure out which mountain in the distance is Camelback, Piestewa, Four Peaks, etc.  We saw little lizards, hummingbirds, quail, and ground squirrels while wondering around as well.  There is much to see and you can get through the gardens as quickly or as leisurely as you would like. We spent about two and a half hours there, which I think is a perfect amount of time. You see everything and are ready to leave by the end.  A very nice place to take visitors on a nice day.

My husband and I decided to check out George and Dragon last Sunday because it was such a nice day out and we wanted to do some day drinking at a place we hadn't been before. George and Dragon it was. The patio is long but narrow with only a handful of round tables on it. However, it's still a nice place to sit with a beer and chat. After a drink on the patio, we headed inside for our next round and decided to just cozy up to the bar. The inside decor is not going to wow you at all, but I appreciate the amount of TVs they have near the bar, showing everything from women's college basketball to English Premier League soccer. I'm also a big fan of bar sports, so the pool table and dart boards in the back get a thumbs up from me as well.  The draft beer selection is large...probably the largest of any of the pubs I have visited in the Valley. I believe it was about $4.75 for a pint, which is slightly cheaper than pubs like Rula Bula. The menu runs the gammet from traditional British fare to very Americanized food with very very moderate prices. Chris had a fish sandwich which he enjoyed and I had a BLT which I requested with no mayo. However, more than half way into the sandwich I realized there was mayo on it! This shocked me because normally I can always detect mayo on sandwiches as I hate it so much...so I'm not sure what G&D did, but they snuck mayo past me and I still loved the sandwich! The fries that came with the sandwiches were tasty. Our bill  (before tip) after five pints of beer, an appetizer, and two sandwiches came to $40.  The two bartenders that waited on us were incredibly friendly and quick. From the signs I saw inside, it looks like Sunday-Thursday, they do a reverse happy hour starting at 11 pm with 2 for 1 well drinks. I love the laid back vibe of G&D and the booths look comfy, so I will be back.

I went with two friends to China Chili for lunch this afternoon. It was very meh. I had the chicken salad (chicken breast, lettuce, cilantro with hot mustard and sesame oil) and a side of white rice. It was very bland. If it had hot mustard and sesame oil on it, I totally missed it. The rice wasn't cooked well at all...seriously, WTF? The soup that came out beforehand was nothing to write home about. My two dining companions had the tofu and said it was not very filling at all and that is was just OK.    The lunch menu is not very large and to me seems to be quite lacking in some staple Chinese dishes that you would expect. The prices were pretty standard for a Chinese restaurant. Thankfully service was fast and pleasant.

We went to Apollo's Saturday night with a group that included Kristin S., Christine O., and their significant others. Apparently on the weekends there is karaoke, and let me tell you, this is not your average karaoke experience! I mean, karaoke where 3/4 of the people that sing actually have decent to really good voices?? Geez, where are the horrible screeching renditions of "Total Eclipse of the Heart" or "Fergalicious"??? Oh wait...that's right my husband was there and sang the latter...and he was awful, but in a funny way. If you do go to participate in karaoke, there are plenty of TV screens with the words. I really liked that a few TVs were reserved to show football and Sportscenter!  Apollo's itself is a moderately sized establishment with an outdoor patio. I only saw the ladies bathroom, cleverly marked with a "Goddesses" sign, but it was tiny; however, there was never a line as most of the crowd was of the male persuasion. My husband and I had beer, so I can't comment on the prices for mixed drinks or shots, but beer was cheaper than most places I have been to in the Valley. Bud light drafts were $2.75 and Fat Tire drafts were $3. Since I was the designated driver that evening, I switched to soda halfway through the night, which was $2 and included free refills. The bartenders were extremely friendly and very prompt in service. There is also a waiter that floats throughout the space if you don't want to go up to the bar.  The crowd ebbed and flowed throughout the evening, but it never got so full of people where I was getting knocked into or where it was impossible to move. All and all, a very laid back place where you can just hang out, chat, and enjoy singing along with "Sweet Caroline".

I loved this place. My husband and I met another couple for dinner at Rokerij on Saturday night. From 4-6 pm, the small plates are $5 each. It is such a great deal. The catch: you have to be sitting at the bar. Not in the booths next to the bar, but at the bar. Each couple ordered 4 small plates and then we all shared. Pretty much everything I tasted, I liked. The brie toasts were by far my favorite...I could have ate the whole plate myself.  The bacon wrapped scallops were really good as well; the calamari was delicious especially because the breading wasn't very heavy and it was quite tasty as well (we consider ourselves calamari snobs). The crab tostadas were good but I don't enjoy cold crabmeat too much.  My husband tried the shrimp scampi and he liked it, but said that if hadn't come with the rice, it would have been bland. He said the rice added flavor to the dish.  With the small plates, it seems that most of the plates come with six of that particular item.   Drink prices were really good...for 8 small plates and 9-10 drinks between the four of us, our bill came to $84. I was shocked when the bill came because it was so cheap, considering all we ate and drank.  The decor in the downstairs bar area is really cool...it's very dim and dark, but it is really cozy. There was a real fire in the fireplace which gave it a log cabin type of feel.  I will definitely be back.

What a delightful little place! The atmosphere is laid back (my husband was in shorts and flip flops and didn't feel out of place), the lighting was dim and our group had a table at the couches, so it gave it almost a loungey feel. Plus the night we were there, the doors were open which allowed an open, airy feel. The wine list isn't huge, which is surprising for a wine bar...I didn't sample any of the wines (I'm waiting to go back for lunch one day for the $5 glasses), but the beer list was good. You can't go wrong with a place that serves Stella Artois, one of my favorite beers.  We had the bruschetta and it was filling enough for dinner. We had a double order of the brie, green apple and fig spread (absolutely delicious); tomato, mozzarella and basil (my least favorite of the third we tried...not enough mozzarella for me); and the roasted peppers and goat cheese (I didn't try it because my husband hogged it, so obviously it was a winner with him).  Our bill was $40 which included the bruschetta, 4 drinks, tax and tip. Not bad at all!  Yes the parking lot is super small, so most likely you'll have to valet for $3. It didn't bother me since I was expecting it, and when our car had to be brought around, it was fast.

We've been twice now for Sunday brunch, most recently yesterday when we took my in-laws, and both times have been fabulous. It's amazing that a place so serene and beautiful exists in the middle of a metropolitan area.  Both times we have had to wait, but nothing too long. Yesterday there were some vendors set up outside Morning Glory Cafe, so my inlaws shopped a bit while waiting.  The food is absolutely delicious! I love how they use fresh and seasonal products, which I think makes it even better.  The American breakfast is standard breakfast but enough food to make me full without being stuffed. My husband had the belgian waffle yesterday and let me have a bite...it was awesome. Plus the whipped cream they give you with it is so light and refreshing...needless to say I ate the rest of it when he was done!  My mother-in-law loved her eggs benedict and had to give half to my father-in-law because the portions were so large. My father-in-law had the chicken enchalidas...delicious! Everyone at the table snagged some...the tomatillo sauce was so flavorful.  I love how they give you your own mini champagne bottle for mimosas.  I'm not sure what the final bill was because my father-in-law paid, but the first time we went for brunch, I think it was around $50 for my husband and I with tip.  After eating, make sure to wander around the property. The Artist's Studio and The Cottage are very cute and full of art and jewelry for sale.  We met the artist in residence yesterday and she was super nice. The artists in residence change every so often, so each time you go, you'll likely see something new.

Since moving to Arizona this fall, I decided that I should be more outdoorsy, especially as AZ boasts to have over 300 days of sunshine a year.  My idea of roughing it is staying at a Super 8 Motel, so hiking seems as outdoorsy as my husband can get me right now.  So far, we've been to South Mountain Park twice to hike.  Now, I won't say that I'm becoming one with nature quite yet, but I actually enjoy myself when we are out hiking!   I like South Mountain Park because there are quite a few trails to pick from, and they range from easy to difficult, so there is something for every level of fitness.  We've hiked Beverly Canyon, which is an easy to moderate trail. Nothing super special about it.  There is parking at the trailhead (44th Street south of Baseline), although the parking lot is not super big.  It was definitely a good first trail to break me in to South Mountain.  On Christmas afternoon, we took our dog and hiked the Mormon Trail.  There is a nice size parking lot available at the trailhead (24th Street and Valley View, which is south of Baseline).  What we thought was going to be about an hour and twenty-ish minute adventure turned into two and a half hours! So, when you get to the top of the Mormon Trail, there is an option to take the Mormon Loop. But, beware, this is not a loop! Eventually, the Mormon Loop deadends and you have to get on the National Trail for a while until you meet back up with the Mormon Trail.  Despite the adventure, it was a great hike and definitely by the end I was sore and tired.  The views were nice and I definitely can't believe places exist like South Mountain and Camelback here in a metropolis area like Phoenix.  I do prefer the views at Camelback more though.  Next time we go to South Mountain, we are definitely printing out one of the maps so we don't get confused like we did yesterday!

I took Sophie this morning to Saguaro Vet Clinic for a checkup and rabies shot. It was recommended to me by a friend who takes her animals there, and despite living in Tempe, I made the drive for the vet. I am so glad I did.  All of the office staff is extremely friendly and does a great job with the patients. The girl who weighed Sophie and did some preliminary checking of her was great - she handled Sophie well and chatted with me while she took Sophie's heartrate and weight. Dr. Ketchmark finished Sophie's physical and gave her the rabies shot (I couldn't look...I know I am a pathetic mommy) and just kept complimenting me on how healthy and great she looks. Plus he clipped her nails for free...I think she was showing up for him because she doesn't let us do that at home!  During the week, they only take appointments from 7 until noon, but they are open on Saturdays as well which is nice for the working folk. Sophie's appointment was 7:30 am and we were out of there a few minutes before 8 am. The prices were extremely reasonable - $60 for the physical; $20 for the rabies show - as well. If you are looking for a good vet for your pets, I would definitely recommend Saguaro.

I love this place. It reminds me of the salon I went to back in Columbus which I absolutely loved. Even though I live in Tempe, I drive the 25 minutes or so up to DC Ranch to go to this place. Right from when you walk in the door, they are very attentive and catering. Both times I have been there, I have never waited more than 3 minutes to be seen, which is an improvement over the salon I went to in Columbus where I might wait 15 minutes after checking in.  The one haircut I have gotten so far was wonderful. I saw Bernadette who is at the stylist level. She is a transplant from the midwest as well, so we had fun chatting while she cut my hair. She did exactly what I wanted and I was in and out in less than an hour.  Plus, for $45 I was extremely happy. I used to pay $55 for a cut and blowdry back in Columbus.   I also have gotten my eyebrows waxed at Par Exsalonce. My experience was fabulous. I was in and out of the salon in less than 15 minutes, which is perfect for a waxing. Jeanette did the waxing and was awesome. She was quick which is what I like. I really like the fact that they use something like baby powder to put on your eyebrows after waxing instead of lotion.  I love this salon and will definitely keep making the 25 minute drive up there in the future.  UPDATE-January 26, 2008  I went for another haircut today and saw Nicole. She is awesome! She is the level above a stylist, so my haircut and style was $55, but that's what I paid in Columbus, so no biggie to me. Nicole was wonderful...I asked for advice and she was very honest and gave me an awesome haircut.  I will definitely be seeing her in the future. She was also very friendly and we chatted like we were old friends the entire 40 minutes or so it took for her to shampoo, cut, dry and style my hair.

My husband and I don't eat at chain restaurants very frequently...we try to avoid them when possible.  Saturday night when trying to decide where to go out for dinner (we are running out of food in our house), I had a list of places I want to try. However, my husband didn't want to spend more than $30 on dinner (no clue why), so all of my ideas were out the window.  We decided on Applebee's since I had a slight craving for a mucho mudslide.  The only highlight of our trip to Applebee's was my mucho mudslide (it was yummy).  My fried chicken salad was large for a half-size and was pretty good.  I'd be concerned if a place could really mess something up as simple as that. My husband got the ultimate trio (basically he got to pick three appetizers)...he ordered the mozzarella sticks (blah...they were barely hot and not as good as they used to be back in the day); the sliders (what is up with every place, not fancy and fancy, having sliders on the menu nowadays??), and chicken wraps (Chris said they were OK).    Our service was worse than the food. It took over 10 minutes after we placed our drink order for our drinks to appear on the table. No clue why it took that long because the bar area wasn't busy and the bartender didn't look backed up.  Second, it took our food forever to come out...we have no clue why.  A mother and daughter walked in after we placed our dinner order and when I glanced over wondering where our food was, I noticed they were eating! They got food before we did!!! GRRRRRRR.  Our bill came to $28, but it was hardly worth it.  On our drive home, we said we should have just gone to Wendy's for dinner...better quality food at a much much cheaper price.

We have taken dry cleaning to Apollo's twice now. The first time we went we took 3 dresses, one silk shirt, and 4 button down shirts. Everything came back perfectly and they were ready the day after my husband dropped them off. The bill was about $45 for all of that.  On Saturday morning, I dropped off 2 dresses, one suit jacket, and 1 button up shirt. One of the dresses required a rip to be sewn up which they were able to take care of. All of the items except for the ripped dress were available for pickup on Monday and the ripped dress was fixed and ready for pickup on Wednesday. I couldn't be happier that my one dress was able to be repaired and Apollo's did a fantastic job. The total for those four items came to $38.  The woman who is always working when I go in is very friendly and lovely to chat with. I haven't been to other dry cleaners here in the Valley, so I don't know how the prices compare, but Apollo's is quick, has good hours, and is convenient to where we live. It's located in the shopping center across from the Safeway on the corner of Broadway and Rural Roads. They are open Monday-Saturday, closed on Sundays. During the week they are open until 7 pm and on Saturdays from 9-5.

Before I went to Vegas this past weekend, a pedicure was a necessity. I decided to check out Magen Nail in Tempe since it's close to where I live and they were open until 7 pm on Friday. You can either make an appointment or just walk-in...I made an appointment but it wasn't necessary. The interior is very simple and clean which is fine with me since I didn'tt need anything fancy.   The staff is very friendly and the technician who gave me my pedicure was very sweet. We chatted the whole time in fact. She did a great job especially with the salt scrub and calf massage (work that day had been stressful and busy so I was in desperate need of relaxation). My pedicure was $19 and the salt scrub was an extra $5, but was totally worth it to me.   A great experience and I will definitely return in the future for manicures and pedicures.

Holy moly, I have found the near perfect sandwich place in downtown Phoenix! Two co-workers and I went last week for lunch because we were craving good sandwiches. Parking was a breeze with a free parking garage right there, and there are plenty of spots, so it alleviates one headache that usually comes with dining in downtown at lunch during the week. The decor is modest and the grocery section is pretty limited, but the products they did have for sale would make for a good meal or two. There is a very limited number of tables inside and out, so make sure to beat the lunch crowd. I've only sampled one sandwich so far which was the caprese. The bread was so fresh and soft and was the perfect compliment to the fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. I forgot to order it without red onions, but luckily there weren't many on the sandwich and most bits were easy enough to pick off. The thing that impressed me the most about the sandwich was that the tomatoes were cut in little bites which is the way I prefer to eat them. I was able to get a burst of cheese and tomato in every bite, which I find isn't always the case with caprese sandwiches at either places. For my sandwich and bottled soft drink, it cost me approximately $8.50. The sandwich menu left me drooling, so I know I will be back in the not too distant future to try another one!  The one negative is that they have a minimum $25 credit card purchase requirement. While they do have an ATM right inside the front door, I can only assume the fees are not very cheap. So remember to have cash or, if you go with a small group, order everything together and use one card.

There aren't many lunch options around the State Capitol, especially when you have to eat fast. Joni's Capitol Cafe is a great option, considering it's in the basement of the building I work in! I have hopped in the elevator plenty of times when I have needed a quick lunch.   The food is much better than your average cafeteria food. There are daily specials, soup, a very nice sized salad bar, desserts, chips, a soda fountain, and even an ice cream machine. Prices are incredibly reasonable...I think one day I purchased a salad and french fries and it was $3.30 and almost every daily special is less than $5. Also, because it is in the basement of the Executive Tower, it's a "who's who" at lunchtime, so if you want some political gossip, it's a great place to be! My only negative is that it is cash only.  Unfortunately, I just received an email today that Joni's Capitol Cafe is closing permanently on May 29th. This makes me sad especially for those of us that work at or around the Capitol, the closest "fast food" option is the cafeteria at the Department of Economic Security.  UPDATE (6/2/08):  While Joni's might be gone, someone else has taken over so we still have food in the Executive Tower! Woo hoo. It's basically the same as it was when it was Joni's so nothing changed except for ownership.

I am giving La Canasta 4 stars mainly because of location and their chips.    I work in the Executive Tower at the Capitol and if you have been in that area, then you know that there are like no options for lunch other than the cafeteria at the DES building or the cafeteria in the basement of the Executive Tower. Frankly, there are some days where we want to escape the building but don't want to risk going downtown, which makes La Canasta a great option for those days.  Also, if you want political gossip, La Canasta is a great place because you can see the whos-who in politics at lunch and possibly overhear some good tidbits. Or you'll just hear staffers like myself and co-workers complaining about our jobs!  As I mentioned previously, the chips and salsa are delicious at La Canasta, but the rest of the food is just OK. It's nothing spectacular that warrants a special trip.  Soda and iced tea are $2.25 (unlimited refills) which is a tad high in my book.  The patio is nice to sit on especially when your office has no windows.  However, today upon leaving, we saw three birds on a table eating off some plates that were sitting on an empty table. I could have done without seeing that.

Nice, simple pizza place on Thomas near Central...makes for a good lunch for those of us that work downtown and need to get out of the office occasionally for lunch. The inside is bigger than I thought it would be and it's very simple, which is fine.  There are a few tables outside as well.  The parking lot out front is TINY, but supposedly you can park around back as well. We parked in front of the CPA's office next door with no problems.  Although I didn't see it advertised anywhere and it's not listed in the menu I took with me, you can buy pizza by the slice, which is very important for me to rate a place as a good pizza joint.  Secondly, my slice of cheese was under $2...another plus.  The slice was large, greasy without being too greasy, and had a healthy ratio of cheese to sauce.  I also ordered a caesar salad...it was large enough so that I could have ate just that for lunch. The only negative was that for the size of the salad, it didn't have enough dressing.  The speciality salad for the day looked delicious and my two co-workers who ordered it really enjoyed it.  For my salad, slice of cheese pizza, and soda, my bill was $10.  Service was quick and Pino's offers call ahead and delivery for those that can't enjoy a leisurely lunch.

When a friend called on Saturday morning asking if I wanted to go to brunch, I suggested The Breakfast Club in Old Town since I had been wanting to go there for some time. I'm really glad I suggested it because it was delicious. I arrived around 1 pm (they close at 3 pm) on a gorgeous Saturday, so I wasn't upset when I was told I couldn't be seated until my dining companion joined me. There are chairs outside to sit in while you wait and it was so nice out, I relished the opportunity to bask in the sunshine. When I mentioned my friend had just arrived and was parking her car, the hostess sat me in a cozy booth inside. Definitely make sure everyone in your party is there so you can be seated right away. Our waitress was really nice and helpful and paid just the right amount of attention to us.  I do wish The Breakfast Club had alcohol because a mimosa on a sunny Saturday would have made the day perfect, but alas they do not have alcohol. My friend enjoyed her green iced tea and my black hot tea was fine. My friend had the Nutty Belgian Waffle (she added berries on the recommendation of our waitress), which filled the entire plate and looked quite yummy. I had the four cheese omelet which was divine! None of the four cheeses overpowered the other and when I cut into the omelet, the cheeses were hot and gooey...yum! The potatoes and peppers that came on the side were good and I left feeling contently full.  For our two drinks, two entrees, and a side of bacon, our bill came to $30 before tip which I thought was very reasonable for a breakfast establishment. I can't wait to go back to try some more items, although hopefully next time I can score a table on the patio.

Crown Room is a gem among the Scottsdale clubs and bars. It's not in the main area of the clubs and bars, so it's a nice place when you want to getaway from that scene.  I always appreciate places with no cover for men and women. Even though we got there after 11 pm on a Friday night, we had our pick of tables. Our waitresses were friendly, prompt and incredibly attentive. I'm not sure if that was because it wasn't overly crowded that night or they were just good waitresses, but either way it's always nice to have friendly service.  The ambience was chic yet casual.  The DJ that night was playing good music for the most part, mainly hip-hop with some house music thrown in for good measure.  My husband and I only had beer that night, so I can't comment too much on drink prices. My Stella Artois was $5 which is pretty standard at most places, so I appreciated that it wasn't more expensive at Crown Room just because we were in Scottsdale. I'm not sure how much Chris' Bud Light was, but I think it was around $3-4.  Bathrooms were unisex and single stalls which normally is a pet peeve of mine, but Crown Room has five bathrooms, so the single stall is acceptable.  I could have done without the chick straddling her boyfriend and making out with him, but heck it wouldn't have been Scottsdale without it!  I will most definitely be returning to Crown Room in the future.

I was made aware of Mickey's Hangover in Scottsdale when I first moved out here because my husband and I are both Ohio State alums, and Mickey's is THE bar to watch Ohio State games on Saturdays.  It's almost like being in Columbus, but with blue skies and warm weather.  The waitstaff is very pleasant during the games, but not extremely fast or attentive. The food is just OK and pretty greasy.  I do enjoy the onion rings, as it compliments my $8 buckets of Bud Light very well.  I 100% do not recommend the sampler platter...we made the mistake of ordering it the first tiime we went to Mickey's. I do believe they have the grossiest mozzarella sticks this side of the Mississippi River. Sorry, but I don't want my mozzarella sticks to come shaped like an eggroll.  And I don't think I've seen anyone drink PBR since my days at Ohio State, but it flows aplenty at Mickey's.  The decor is laid back with comfy couches up front. The catch during Ohio State games we learned is that you have to reserve the couches. Seriously that is lame.  Our experience at Mickey's during the Ohio State/Michigan game completely turned us off to the establishment and I am not really sure we will be returning in the future.

My husband and I ventured to Suede Saturday evening after dinner with Kristin S., Ashley A., their husbands, and another couple. I had so much fun...so much in fact that I remember leaving Suede and walking to the car, but don't remember actually getting into the car or getting home :)  Suede is across the street from Axis-Radius and has a great outdoor patio area. Getting in was a bit disorganized...people were just crowded around with no clear line which was a little annoying especially since we were all ready to get inside, get drinks, listen to music and hang out.  There is no cover for ladies and it's $10 for guys. There are two bars inside which is a nice touch and service at the bar was incredibly quick each time I went up there. The music is great and there were tons of songs played that I love and got us dancing...unfortunately they only played the first part of each song and then changed it mid-song to the next....very annoying after awhile.  Drinks were reasonably priced as a rum and coke was $7 and domestic beer bottles were $4.   Of course, as it is in Scottsdale, the people watching is awesome especially on the patio.  I will definitely return to Suede.

Disappointing is the best summary of our dining experience at Furio last night. The highlights of my meal were the free bread and pesto and the chocolate smore martini I ordered for dessert. I had a caesar salad before my meal which was the perfect size and it was tasty, but seriously salad shouldn't be hard to pull off. For my entree I had the chicken and rock shrimp fettucini...holy cream! The entire dish was smothered in cream which made it much too heavy for me to eat more than 1/4 of the entree. My husband had the mac and cheese with pancetta before his meal and I tried a bite...wow, Furio really has a heavy hand with cream. It wasn't an exceptional dish and Chris only ate about half. He had the pan seared sea scallops for an entree which he also let me try. My two bites were really gritty and they were not perfectly cooked. No melt in your mouth quality. The chocolate smore martini was really good especially since it comes with a cooked marshmellow and a graham cracker coated rim. I can't really say it was worth the $12 price tag, but it was tasty. Chris ordered the chocolate tort for dessert which was soooo rich. Rich to the point of being inedible. For 1 beer, 1 glass of Albarino, 1 martini, 1 salad, 1 mac and cheese side dish, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert, our bill came to $103 before tip. It was definitely not worth what we paid at all.  Furio itself is located in a great location in Old Town with plenty of public parking nearby. The inside is chic and trendy...Chris commented when we sat down that it reminded him of a place that the people on "The Hills" would dine at. The funny thing about that is that literally twenty or so minutes later a couple sat down at the table next to us and the guy said exactly the same thing! We sat in the dining room which has a flat screen TV on one wall where you can watch what is happening in the lounge/bar area...so weird.   I would go back to Furio to sit in the lounge/bar area and enjoy some martinis, but I will not be going back to eat dinner.

Everything people told me about this place being hard to find were true. Thank goodness I was with Kristin S. and she had been there before so she knew where to go. If I had tried to find it by myself, I think I'd still be walking the streets of Scottsdale.  It's really cozy inside, but definitely a place you could have a romantic evening or just a nice dinner with friends. I had the three cheese fondue and it was delicious. The amount of bread and apples on the plate were just enough, so that I was pleasantly content after eating it all, but not stuffed. For three glasses of wine, a flatbread pizza (which I didn't try, but it looked delicious), and my three cheese fondue, our bill was around $45.   Now that I know where this place is, I will definitely be back.

We decided to check out Coach House last night for a few drinks to celebrate my husband's 27th birthday. We love dive to slighty dive-ish bars as they usually have cheap drinks, interesting character and personality, and a good jukebox.  Coach House fits all three of those criteria.   The bartenders were extremely friendly and chit-chatted with us a bit. The clientele is quite mixed, but it was great to see tons of people singing along to the jukebox without a care in the world. Someone definitely loaded up on the Michael Jackson selections that the jukebox offers, as we heard a couple of MJ songs from back in the day (you know, when he was black and had a nose).   It definitely looks like Christmas threw up inside Coach House, but it gives it character and personality, which I appreciate. I know I will definitely be back to Coach House because any bar that opens at 6 am gets an A in my book!

Wow. From start to finish, our experience at Elements on Friday night was awesome. When I made our reservation, I mentioned that we would be there to celebrate our two year wedding anniversary and asked for a booth by the window.  When we were seated Friday night, we got a booth by the window as requested which made me happy.  Although we missed the sunset (we did see it at Jade Bar though), it was still a great seat as we could see the twinking lights of homes in the distance set against the dark mountain outline.  My one and only complaint about our seats was that there were several large groups behind us that were extremely loud. So loud in fact that it made it hard to hear my husband talk. Thankfully we only had to endure that for about 30 minutes.  Service was prompt and attentive without being in your face.  Our waiter quietly checked on us, but also gave us our privacy which we appreciated. We each had a glass of wine with our meal...I had a delicious Albarino and my husband had a Riesling which was good. We started with the crab and shrimp stuffed peppers for an appetizer. While they were good, I wish it had been a hot dish instead of cold. Also, a tad more crabmeat would have made me happier as well.  For entrees, I had the chicken which came with a potato cake. Wow, my dish was awesome. I only wish there had been more potato cake because I practically had to fight Chris for it. The chicken was cooked perfectly and had a nice sauce that came with it.  My husband had the pacific halibut which came with pasta in a basil sauce. The pasta was delicious and I kept sneaking bites of it.  Normally if we get an appetizer, we don't indulge in dessert, but as we were there for our anniversary, we thought we'd splurge and get two desserts.  The chocolate peanut decadence was...decadent! The peanut butter pie was a little too rich for my taste, but luckily the chocolate ice cream almost balanced it out.  The rum butter almond lemon cake was also really delicious...I loved how the whip cream was light and had a hint of an almond taste to it.  The best part was that both dessert plates came out with "Happy Anniversary" written on them in chocolate and they were free!  Our bill came to $105 (before tip) which included two glasses of wine; one appetizer, and two entrees. If our desserts hadn't been comped, it would have been closer to $130 before tip.  Elements is really a 4.5 star restaurant; however, I am knocking a .5 star off because of the noise factor which takes away from the romantic atmosphere that my husband and I were looking for. Great for special occasions or just when you want a really good dining experience from start to finish.

We ended up at Elements Friday night with my in-laws on their last night in Phoenix, as we thought it would be a nice way to end their trip. Our server was absolutely fantastic - she did a good job of answering questions, helping with selections, and making sure we had everything we needed without being in our face. Since we had a later reservation (8:45 pm), the restaurant was pretty full when we arrived, but as the night progressed, it emptied out. This time, noise was not a factor which was a relief.  My father-in-law ordered the special that evening which was similar to ahi tuna...he loved it. The rest of us ordered the scallop dish...it left us a bit underwhelmed. The scallops were on the bland side, although they were cooked pretty well. They could have used some seasoning to make them really good. Our desserts (chocolate torte and chocolate peanut butter decadence) were delicious and totally redeemed the meal in my mind. A bottle of wine, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts, set my in-laws back $230.  I still think Elements is a great place, but my husband and I were a bit let down that it wasn't as phenomenal as last year when we went for dinner.

To quickly summarize my feelings of our experience at Ruth Chris's: Thank goodness we had a giftcard that paid for part of our meal! If we had paid full price, my husband and I would have felt more ripped off than we did when we left.  Now, we don't mind dropping $145 for a dinner if the food is really good and the atmosphere is amazing. Sadly, neither was true at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  My husband had the petit filet and shrimp combo for dinner. While he said the shrimp were very good, he said the steak was just OK. Definitely not the most amazing steak he has ever ate.  I had the crab cake entree, which was three lump crab cakes. Was it worth the almost $30 pricetag? Heck no! I appreciated that there was really no filling and it was lump crab meat, it was way way too moist for me.  I don't like my crabcakes bone dry, but I don't like them overly moist. McCormick and Schmick's are way too dry, but Ruth Chris's are way too moist. Blah. Also, there was too much horseradish or something like along those lines for my taste.  I can't wait to visit my parents in Maryland this summer to actually get some good crabcakes.  Our mashed potato side that we ordered was large enough for the two of us, but the potatos were meh.  The $1 instant potatoes we buy at Fry's are better and have more flavor.  For dessert, we had the cheesecake. I'm sorry to say that the cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory is 10x better than what I ate at Ruth Chris's.  Our waiter was very nice...attentive but not overbearing or pushy. The atmosphere was just OK.  We had reservations, but still had to wait almost 20 minutes to be seated...WTF? And for an "upscale" restaurant, I was shocked to see people roll in with jeans and sweatshirts on! Yuck.  My husband and I said that it is highly unlikely we will ever go back to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  High prices do not equal good food.

I visited Lon's last night for Restaurant Week with Kristin S. If you don't know where you are going, it is definitely a tricky place to find. It does add to the appeal because it gives the feeling of seclusion which would be appreciated if you were dining on the patio. We decided to sit inside because there was a wait for the patio, but it looked very relaxing and romantic with soft candlelight. The inside is large with many different dining rooms and the decor is all Southwestern. I'm not really into the Southwest as a decorating style, so it was a bit much for me.  For my starter, I had the cucumber, tomato and blue cheese salad...the tomatoes were very fresh and the blue cheese was a nice compliment and did not overpower the salad at all. I had the sea scallop entree. It was a very generous portion as the three scallops that came on the plate were really large. They were not the best scallops I have had (they didn't have that melt in your mouth quality), but they were cooked perfectly and were not gritty. The chocolate truffle tort was a perfectly sized as a dessert, but I didn't eat more than four bites of it because it was much much too rich for me.  Our server Chris was very nice and provided good service. We did sit for awhile while they ran our credit cards, but we found out that was because their credit card machine broke. It would have been nice if they had come over and said it was taking awhile because of machine problems, but that's just a minor complaint. There is complimentary valet which was very quick and polite. Overall I enjoyed Lon's and would go back to sit on the patio and try the regular menu with my husband on a special occasion, like our anniversary.

This is a solid four star establishment if you are coming for the beer selection and atmosphere. I have to minus 1/2 star for confusing service...we had three different people wait on us and at one point the one waitress forgot that we had placed an order with her (luckily she had rang it in, but still). I also have to minus 1/2 star for the food that we ordered. We had the chicken quesadillas and bruschetta. The chicken quesadillas were good in the fact that they had a lot of chicken meat, which was tasty. Other than that, they were incredibly blah. There was barely any cheese on them and some green chiles. The plate didn't even have lettuce or tomatoes on it. The bruschetta was not spectacular at all...in fact it had way too much garlic on it which overpowered everything else.  Onto the good stuff...great beer selection! There are tons of beers on tap from a nice variety of breweries, but the main attraction seems to be the enormous selection of bottled beer. You can pick one out to drink there or you can take it to go. We didn't try any of the bottled beers this time, but next time we definitely plan to. Since I was driving, I was boring and just had an 8th Street Ale. My husband tried two different beers, but unfortunately I don't remember the names. One was a stout that he enjoyed very much...it was really smooth and had a really nice creamy aftertaste. The other beer he tried was an Irish ale, but it was not very enjoyable at all, which disappointed us.  Prices were incredibly moderate and for three beers and the two appetizers, our bill without tip was $29.  There is nothing flashy about Papago Brewing Co...it's in a strip mall like everything else seems to be in Arizona and the sign on the front is pretty small, so you may drive by it while looking for it like I did. The inside is wood and dimly lit with a large TV screen and two smaller TVs (thankfully they had basketball on!). The jukebox has a very large selection (bonus points for having Dropkick Murphys) and has a great mix of the cheesy songs you love to sing along to, as well as current artists and songs.  There is also a selection of board games that you can play while drinking and hanging out, which is a nice touch.

Best.drunk.food.ever.  I fell in love with Pita Pit as a student at Ohio State (we had one near campus) and when we moved out here last year, I thought I was going to have to break up with Pita Pit. But luckily, I didn't have to because there is one here! My husband and I have had it delivered to our apartment since it reopened and it was very quick and arrived about 20 minutes after we placed our order. On our walk home from Mill Avenue after watching the ASU-Georgia game at Tavern on Mill, I got a craving for Pita Pit and since we had to pass it to get home, we stopped in. We were the only customers, so service was so quick. I got the BLT pita (so original I know) and it was delicious as always, although I would have liked if they had cooked the bacon just a minute longer, but it was crispy so I was mostly happy. The pita was $5.95 which for the size is a fair price.  Since it's open until the wee hours of the morning, it's the perfect pit stop after a night of drinking.

Chris H and I ended up at the Vine on Friday night after hitting a few bars on Mill since it's stumbling distance from where we live. He had been there once before for happy hour, but I had never been. I think we found our new neighborhood dive bar hang out spot!  The building itself on the outside is pretty non-descript, so you would probably drive by and not even notice it. The inside is large with a main bar area with tables and then a back room with pool tables. The back room also has a breathalyzer that you can use for $1...first time I ever saw that at a bar. There are also a ton of TVs scattered throughout the space. Oh, and did I mention there was a very large deer's head mounted on the wall?   Normally we hate bars, especially dive bars, that have a cover. I mean a $4 cover before 10 pm?? But, we quickly learned that the special that evening was $1 you call its, so that made up for the cover. We sat at the bar and the bartender, although kinda creepy looking, was super nice and informed us that there was only like 1 or 2 drinks that weren't $1. Sweet! Our draft beers came in plastic cups, which fit in with the dive bar atmosphere. We got to that intoxicated stage where fried food sounds really good although you know you will regret it the next day, so Chris ordered mozzarella sticks which were pretty good because the batter was light...they reminded me of the ones you can get at Casey Moores.   We'll definitely be going back to the Vine due to proximity and good drink specials.

After living in Tempe for 18 months and making more trips to Rula Bula than I can count on one hand, I figured it was time for an update. I'm still not wowed by the food - baked brie and the chips w/Killarney Sauce are the only two items I will order because they are both really good.   The outdoor patio is awesome. I've always had fast service and even though it does get crowded at night, I never feel super cramped. The only thing I didn't appreciate was before an ASU football game a few months ago, I wasn't allowed to order two drinks at the outdoor bar because they were both going to be for me. Apparently that wasn't allowed - lame. Indoors is still a lot of fun especially due to the live music. Bar service inside is fast for me, but that's probably because some of the bartenders recognize me from how much I frequent Rula Bula.  I'm bumping Rula Bula up to four stars because I always have a good time drinking there with my husband and friends. Plus we always meet interesting people and have fun stories when we leave. Go for the drinking and music, not for the food.

My first impression when walking into the Gammage Auditorium earlier this week was, "WOW, it's huge!". I found it a little confusing at first to find exactly where my "Portal" was, but once I realized that odd numbered sections were on one side of the lobby and evens were on the other side, I found it much easier to navigate. Once you get past the initial ushers who scan your tickets, I didn't see many people helping find your seat. In fact once I got to Portal 10, there was no one outside the door to help direct you to your seat, which I found slightly odd, but perhaps they don't feel like it is necessary since it's a pretty easy theatre to get around. The lobby is large and there were drinks/snacks for sale as well as merchandise.  I bought a ticket for opening night of "A Chorus Line", part of the "Broadway Across America" series, last minute and not knowing the theatre decided to go cheap and sit in the balcony. I was in row 2 toward the center, so my seat wasn't horrible and I had a good view of the stage. However, since the theatre is so large, I felt very removed from the action. I've sat in balconies in other theatres and have never felt so far away from the stage. Next time I go to the Gammage, I plan to sit in one of the lower sections and recommend that for anyone planning to see a show there. I did hear the people in front of me complain about the first row seats and they looked like they were sitting on the edge of their seats to see better as there was a railing in front of them.  I think the Gammage is the most attractive building on the ASU campus and feel fortunate that such a place exists in Tempe and the Valley.

For my inlaws last evening here in the Valley, we went to House of Tricks in Tempe because they wanted to try it based on a recommendation of one of their friends back in Ohio.  The patio area is really pretty and we were lucky to get a table toward the back of the patio because it was a tad more secluded and we had better views of the beautiful flowers in the garden. The only bad thing about the location was there was not a light overhead like other tables on the patio so you had to hold your menu up to the candlelight to read it.  The wine list is quite extensive, but we decided to go simple and had the Columbia Valley Riesling which was crisp and smooth. For appetizers we had the cheese plate and the mushroom flan.  My inlaws loved the flan and said it had good flavor. The cheese plate was delicious...their was blue cheese, brie, and two other cheeses.  All were very nice and there was a nice amount of apples, grapes, and strawberries as well.  For dinner, I had a caesar salad and the scallop appetizer. The salad was a perfect size and the dressing was really nice and had a good garlic kick without being overpowering.  The scallops were fine...not to die for or worth ordering again, but not bad. There was a little broth on the plate that was very tasty. I could have done without the lima beans that accompanied it.  My husband had the sea bass (it comes de-boned for you) which he enjoyed; my father in law had the salmon based on their friend's recommendation which he liked a lot; and my mother in law had the duck which she liked, but she did not enjoy the blackberry vinagrette that came with it.  We tried two desserts, the apple crisp and the triple mousse tower, and both were excellent.  For two appetizers, four meals, two desserts, and 2 bottles of wine, our bill came to $195 before tip.  Our waitress was very nice but service was very slow and not up to par with what you would expect at a place with the level of prices that House of Tricks has.  My other negative about HOT is that it is loud when you sit outside. Between the mosque music, the traffic on the streets around HOT, and some other random noises from the immediate area, it is very distracting and takes away from the atmosphere and sereneness of the restaurant.

I like Caffe Boa. It just suprises me that such a place exists on Mill Avenue.  The inside is really nice with dim lights that give it a slightly romantic yet swanky atmosphere.  I don't like how the bar area is kinda small, so especially if you are going for happy hour, go early!  Service at the bar is really good, and the bartenders are very nice.  My husband and I checked out dinner one Saturday night when we wanted to stay close to home, but have a good dinner at a nice establishment. Caffe Boa definitely provided that. I had the Tortellini Brigantino (tricolor cheese tortellini) and my husband had the Voodoo Pasta (he substituted the chicken for shrimp)...we both loved our dinners. I really liked how the portions were the perfect size-not too small, not too big. I really hate places that have huge portions where you know you are not even going to eat like 1/4 of what is on your plate (ahem, Cheesecake Factory). Our two entrees, 3 glasses of wine, and 1 beer plus tip came to around $75. Not bad at all!  Our waiter was extremely nice and while, the restaurant was loud especially since there was live music outside, conversation was not impossible.  I checked out Caffe Boa's happy hour last night after hearing good things about it.  Anytime you can go someplace for happy hour and leave with a $16 bill after ordering three glasses of wine and a bruchetta appetizer, you know it's a good place.  I know I will definitely be back for many more happy hours there!

So for my 100th review I decided to write about Casey Moore's. It is a delightful combination of two bars at Ohio State that my husband and I frequented quite often during our years in Columbus, so it brings back fond memories of nights of heavy drinking and chilling on outdoor patios during the few precious months of warmth we have in the Midwest.  Casey's is a great spot if you want a laid back bar, especially on a Friday afternoon when you skip out of work early.  My husband and I are big fans of places where we can sit outside, have a few glasses of beer, and catch up since during the week we are occasionally too busy to really see each other much.  The other great thing is the cross section of people Casey's attracts...undergrads, grad students, professors, young professionals like myself, and other folks who live in or around the neighborhood.  Service has always been friendly and prompt each time we've been there, whether it be a Friday afternoon at happy hour or a Wednesday or Thursday night at 10 pm.  The only food we've ate at Casey's has been the mozzarella sticks (the perfect fried food companion to beer) and they are delicious...I really enjoy the light battering because it doesn't sit so heavy in my stomach.  My only small gripe with Casey's is their parking lot which gets full pretty quickly and you can't park on some of the streets until a certain point in the evening.  But I guess that really means that my husband and I shouldn't be so lazy and should just ride our bikes.

Anyone who knows me well knows that I hate grocery shopping. Hate it. Recently I was introduced to Trader Joe's and this past weekend, I took my husband there for the first time. While I can't say I have fallen in love with grocery shopping, I have found that I can at least go to TJ's when need be.  The layout of the store is fabulous. It's just a big enough store to give you variety and some choices, but not big enough to overwhelm you, especially if you are not a seasoned grocery store veteran. The staff is very friendly and always willing to help you find something, and the check out clerks are chatty without being annoying. I really can't compare TJ's prices to those you would find at a regular big box grocery store, but according to my husband who does all of our grocery shopping and knows which stores are the best for certain items, he says that TJ's prices are comparable if not lower than other grocery stores.  I like the pre-packaged salads, sandwiches, and wraps, which are perfect to take to work for lunch. In fact, I had a TJ's chicken caesar wrap for lunch today and it was delicious! Do make sure to check the dates before purchasing to ensure that if you aren't going to eat it that day that it will last for a few more days. The organic pesto pizza that can be found in the frozen section is also very good and just the right size for two people. I was a little disappointed in the Red Delicious apples that I bought (nicely priced at 49 cents each)...they didn't have the crunch to them that I appreciate, but I'm not sure if it was the quality of their selection or that I just did a crappy job of picking two apples.  This TJ's does seem to be quite popular especially given it's location in the same shopping center as Changing Hands and Wildflower, so if you go on a Saturday, I would suggest going early. We arrived at 11 am and it was quite busy and the parking lot was almost full.

My husband and I went to the Coyotes/Blue Jackets game on Saturday evening, and despite the Blue Jackets losing, we had a really good time! Entrance into the arena was very quick and we all received a fleece blanket as the free giveaway, which came in very handy during the game. Our seats were in section 228, row A, and provided a very nice view of the game. Despite being on the second level, I didn't feel far removed from the action at all; plus we had some very entertaining fans around us, so my yelling seemed tame! The most surprising part of our game experience at was how freaking cold it was!! OK, I know, you're thinking that we were at a hockey game so what did we expect? But my husband played ice hockey for a number of years and we have been to NHL games before when we lived in Ohio, and seriously, I have never been to an ice rink as cold as this one. Thank goodness for the free fleece blanket!  Unfortunately the concession stand closest to our section only sold Coors Light (very low down on the beer totem pole if you ask me), but later in the game, my husband trekked down to a concession stand a few sections over and found that they were selling Miller Lite drafts, which although not ideal, was much much better. I really didn't understand the purpose of the promotion/cheerleader girls that the team employs and I could have done without all the jumbotron closeups of them throughout the game. Call me crazy, but I just don't get promotion/cheerleader chicks for professional sports teams.  I love that there is free parking and many pre and post game dining and drinking options. Even though I feel like we are driving to the other side of the earth to get to Glendale, we'll return for future hockey games and concerts.

I don't make it over to the west side very often, but Friday night I found myself in that area since my husband and I had dinner with Melissa H and her husband Matt H. After dinner in Glendale, we decided to check out The Deli as we wanted a laid back place to have some drinks. The Deli delivered.  Pool, darts, a DJ (basically a guy with a laptop), a scratcher machine (yes, my husband got a ticket to try to win it big) and plenty of TVs to watch sports are all available. This is a very casual place, so there is definitely no need to dress up at all. Even in jeans, sandals, and a halter top, I was overdressed. Jeans and a t-shirt would be a much more appropriate outfit for this establishment. The highlight of The Deli is the people watching. We witnessed a fight that resulted in one guy getting kicked out, an older gentleman playing pool and in between turns dancing to the music, and some cougars on the prowl.   Pitchers of beer were $6.75 and were served with frosted glasses (thank you...I love when bars do that). There were also $1 drafts and $2 you call it vodka drinks available as well. You can definitely get drunk for cheap, which is exactly what Melissa H and I did. If I lived over  in the area, this would be my go-to dive bar spot.

My husband and I went to Onda for dinner...unfortunately it did not live up to expectations.  The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and has a great atmosphere. We had a booth tucked in a corner and there was no one next to us (we had 6 pm reservations), so it was romantic and cozy.  Our server was very nice...attentive without being pushy.  The best thing that we ate was the bread and dipping mix that other reviews have raved about...it was delicious.  If we had just stopped with that, Onda would get at least 4 stars from me...unfortunately, we had an appetizer and dinner.  For an appetizer, we had the calamari.  It ranks as some of the worst calamari we have had...the breading was overpowering and I am not sure the calamari was cooked perfectly.  I ordered the capellini and scallops...big mistake.  The pasta flavor was incredibly bland and the scallops were super rubbery and did not have a good flavor at all.  They were so poor that I could barely force myself to eat two of them.  My husband ordered the garlic crusted sea bass which he said was just OK and there was nothing special to it.  We certainly did not feel that the quality of the food lived up to the amount we paid, which is why Onda only gets 2 stars from me.

Let me just preface this review by saying, I really really didn't want to like Pizzeria Bianco because of all the hype I have heard about it. Unfortunately (or fortunately I suppose), I actually did like Pizzeria Bianco. While I cannot say it was the best pizza I have ever ate, it was good and I walked away a pleasantly full and happy gal.  To avoid having my opinion of Pizzeria Bianco swayed one way or the other by a potential 3 hour wait, and since I don't feel like any food is worthy of a 3 hour wait, I went with a group of 6 friends and made a reservation. My biggest advice if you are going to make a reservation, make it way before the date you want to go! It took three times calling for a reservation before I got one...last night the hostess shed some light on why...they only take one reservation for each time slot. If you do decide to go without a reservation, take advantage of drinks and apps beforehand at either Bar Bianco or Rose and Crown!  Pizzeria Bianco is small and tables are very close together, so if you don't like dining almost on top of the table next to you, I suggest skipping this place. Our waiter was friendly and provided good service most of the night. Coke comes in the old fashioned bottles and the alcohol selection is a bit small, but I guess the focus is really the food. Our group started with an order of the spiedini (fontina wrapped in prosciutto) and an order of the tomato and mozzarella as appetizers. Definitely if you are with a group, order at least two of the spiedini, as it only comes with two skewers which only affords each person a very small bite. The tomato and mozzarella fed our group easily, so one order for a group of 6 should be fine. The tomatoes were so fresh and juicy, and the mozzarella was super fresh as well...all and all, it was probably the best caprese I have had. Both appetizers were winners with our group. We also went through two plates of the bread and olive oil before our pizzas arrived...my only complaint was that I prefer when restaurants put a bit of seasoning in the olive oil to kick the flavor up a bit.  We ordered five pizzas...2 Biancoverdes, 1 Margherita, 1 Rosa, and 1 Sonny Boy. We probably should have just gone with four pizzas, but with five, we had leftovers for some people to take home. I really enjoyed the Biancoverde and the Margherita, although the Biancoverde was by far the heaviest of the pizzas and had intense flavors. It had a bit too much argula for my liking, but it was very good. The margherita was simple, yet tasted very fresh and had a good cheese to tomato ratio, which is very important in my book for a quality Margherita. The Rosa and Sonny Boy were hits with our group as well, although I think the Sonny Boy was probably the least favorite of the four kinds we ordered. For the two appetizers, five pizzas, a glass of wine, a coke, double expresso, and a cappucino, our bill came to $111...when we added in the tip, each person in our party of 6 paid $22. I thought that was incredibly reasonable and actually much less than I had been planning to spend.  There were a few negatives about my Pizzeria Bianco experience: 1. Parking - the lot for PB customers was full when I arrived at 5:30 pm, so I was directed to the garage on 5th Street which was fine. However, even after getting my ticket validated at PB, it still cost me $3 to park. Not a huge thing, but I think that people turned away from the lot (which is free) should be told that they will still have to pay to park at the garage, just at a discounted rate.  2. When we arrived at 6:30 (time of our reservation), we had to wait for 15 minutes for a table. Granted, not a three hour wait, but it just irks me a bit when you have reservations for a specific time and then are still made to wait.  3. The table of two guys next to us were asked to leave by the hostess...she told them they could finish their beers outside or next door, but they had to leave so a party of two could be seated at their table. I have never heard of something like that happening before. Our group was a bit shocked and as my friend said, "I guess to be a hostess here you need to have quite a pair".   4. After we got our check, we waited over 15 minutes for someone to take it and bring the change (we paid in cash). Our waiter never actually came and got it...the hostess overheard us wondering when someone was going to come and get our money, so she picked it up and handled it for us. The funny thing was that there was a group waiting for our table outside!   Overall, I would say Pizzeria Bianco is a 3.5 star establishment, but I'm giving it 4 stars (Yelp really needs half stars!) because the food exceeded my expectations in terms of quality and freshness, and our group walked away quite happy with our dining experience despite a few hiccups.

This past Saturday night I was in Vegas with a group for a girls weekend and we needed a place for a birthday celebration. We decided on Body English since we got a freaking sweet deal for a table...needless to say the whole night was perfect starting with our arrival at the Hard Rock. We passed time in the area outside the club since there was a drink stand and chatted with some guys that were hanging out there as well. We met our host Mike outside BE and got right in. Working with a host and having a table is definitely the way to go at Body English...I'm not sure I would have loved it as much if we had just waited in line. From what I remember, the music was really good and got us all up and dancing for the whole night. It is really dark inside but I think that adds to the atmosphere and ambiance. Plus isn't it better sometimes to not be able to see the guys hitting on you and your friends??  Our table was in the corner on the second floor. We had plenty of room to get up and dance which we did. There are tables near the dance floor downstairs but I actually think the second floor tables are better. I left my purse at our table accidentally and ran back up to get it before doing a shot at the bar and it was still sitting there with nothing missing (whew!). And since I apparently lose things after drinking heavily, I lost my phone at some point and somehow a random guy at BE (probably at the table next to us) found it and returned it to my friend.  For six girls, our table ended up costing us around $95 each (my friend who set up everything took care of the host's tip by herself as a present to the birthday girl), but like I said we got a really sweet deal so I would count on around $150 per person normally.  We had a great night at Body English and I would go there again with a group of friends when I am in Vegas the next time.

When my plane landed in Vegas this past Friday morning, I had two emails from Brian, a host at Body English, that I had spoken with previously. He offered my group buy one bottle, get one free, for that night which I promptly took him up on. Brian met us outside Body English at 10:45 pm and walked us to our table. We had a great corner table on the second floor. My only complaint about getting a table at BE is that they are really close together so you don't really get the super intimate feel that you do at other clubs. However, this definitely encourages a social environment as we talked and danced with the guys at the table next to us and another table gave some of my girls shots from their bottle.  Our waitress was really nice and paid really good attention to us all night long. Bottle prices are actually a bit lower than at some other Vegas clubs I have been to (bottles start at $400). BE played good music all night long, although I could have done without hearing two Lady Gaga songs back to back.  BE is definitely a fun club if you want to venture off the strip, although if you aren't doing table service, be prepared for a clusterf*ck of a line to get in.

Scottsdale Fashion Square has just about every store I could possibly want while I am shopping. I love that it has the basic mall stores that I shop in, but it also has designer stores and more high-end shops that I occasionally want or need to shop in.  I also love that SFS has Neiman Marcus! Yippee! I think the only Neiman Marcus in Ohio was in Cleveland, so two hours from where I lived in Columbus. Now I have a Neiman Marcus 10 minutes from my house.    I braved Christmas shopping there this year and it actually wasn't bad. I went on a Tuesday night about two weeks before Christmas and it wasn't super crowded at all. I've gone other times during the week at night, and it's a great time to go.  Saturday afternoons on the other hand...watch out! SFS is super crowded and you have to fight the crowds both walking around and in the stores.  For such a major mall, I appreciate how easy it is to park and find a spot. I always park in the garage next to Nordstroms and never have a problem finding a spot on the first or second level.  I'm not a huge fan of the Nordstroms at SFS...it's not the best one I have ever been to, although the shoe department is amazing.  Also, the BCBG store has a pretty lackluster selection of dresses and always has that picked over feel that a store like Old Navy is famous for.

We ventured up Scottsdale Road on Monday night because my inlaws wanted to take us out for dinner and they wanted Mexican. The sign for the restaurant out front is not that big, so definitely pay attention. The patio is really cute, but we opted to sit inside. Inside is small and cozy with exposed brick. I felt instantly at home.  My mother-in-law and I had the House Special margaritas which we both liked, although I have to say that the margaritas my mother-in-law makes at home are way better. For appetizer, we tried the queso fundido with crab which we all loved. Nice pieces of lump crabmeat and a nice manageable size for an appetizer. For dinner, I had the chicken tacos which were delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of it in the tacos. Even though it's listed as an appetizer, it was more than enough food for me for dinner especially after eating the queso fundido. My mother-in-law had the goat cheese and blue cheese crepes with pomegranate sauce; I snagged a bite...delicious! My father-in-law had the seafood tacos which he really liked (I didn't get to sample them). My husband had the crab enchiladas which I also snagged a bite of...they were good and the tomato chipotle sauce gave the dish a nice kick. We did however both taste a bit of shell which was unfortunate.  Our server was really nice and paid just the right amount of attention to us. I didn't get a chance to see the final bill since my father-in-law was paying, but the prices were very reasonable considering the amount of food you received. I think the most expensive entree I saw was about $20 which includes two sides. Definitely a place we will return to especially when it's nice out to sit on the patio.

I stayed at the Mirage this past weekend with two girlfriends. Because my friend had vouchers to use for an MGM property, we each paid next to nothing for a deluxe strip view room on the 19th floor. The view was awesome and I snapped some good pics. The room itself is a very standard hotel room and the bathroom is pretty small. We had a problem with some of the outlets in the room not charging our cell phones very well. The self park area is a bit hidden, but allows you to enter the hotel near JET. This was lucky for us because we had barely taken ten steps in the Mirage when we were approached by a JET host who put us on the guestlist and gave us wristbands for free drinks until midnight. Normally I am skeptical of such an offer, but it actually worked out really well and we had a fun night.  Check-in was quick; the concierge was very helpful in assisting us obtain dinner reservations at Japonais; and our floor was very quiet. The pool area is a nice little oasis, although the drink waitresses did not come around very often. Are there better rooms in Vegas? Yep. But if you are looking for a room in a good location on the Strip with a manageable sized casino and lots of dining/nightlife options, the Mirage is a good choice.

I chose the MGM Grand for my visit to Vegas last weekend because of price and location. It's not a far walk to the center of the Strip (although construction makes it more frustrating now) and from the airport, it's about $13. I booked two of the standard rooms online through the MGM website in February and got a great deal...two rooms for three nights for a total of $580!  I like that you can check in to an MGM property at the airport, although unfortunately they messed up and gave me the wrong rooms which we discovered when we got to the hotel. However, the front desk fixed it immediately and within minutes, I had the correct rooms. While one of the rooms had a kinda crappy view, the room I stayed in had a great view of the Strip. The rooms are pretty basic and not as impressive as some of the other rooms at other hotels in Vegas that I have stayed at (for example, there are no flat screen TVs in the room and it's a generic shower/tub combo in the bathroom). But if you just want a basic room with comfortable beds, MGM is a good choice.  I was initially hestitant to book MGM due to the sheer size of the property, but I have to say it was very easy to get around. The trek to the pool is a big long from the room elevators, but it's a good chance to work off food and alcohol from the night before! There are plenty of restaurants to choose from and a small food court area if you want something quick.  I used the concierge for a few things and they were very helpful, although I did have to sit on hold for five minutes one day. Checkout was quick and easy. Even if the taxi line looks long, it moves very quickly; additionally if you are just going to the airport, consider the hotel's airport shuttle which is only $6 per person.  MGM is a 3.5 star hotel, but I'll be generous and round up because it was exactly what my group needed and was a very good price.

I stayed at the MGM Grand from September 27 - October 2 with my husband. My husband was in town for a conference which was being held at the MGM Conference Center, so that is why we stayed here. We stayed in a standard room with two queen beds (we had friends who came up for a night) that was more than adequately sized. The bathroom is pretty average for a hotel - I must prefer the bathrooms at Aria and Palazzo.  The hotel is still a maze to get around and you will walk...a lot! The trek from the room elevators to the conference center is long; the walk from the elevators to the pool is long; and the walk to the sports book (especially if you are going from the pool) is long. But it's a good chance to work off all the food and booze!   The MGM pool complex remains one of my favorite pool areas in Vegas, even if cocktail service is sporadic and slow. At the end of September at 10:30 am it was not hard for me to snag a chair mere steps from the pool. We did not dine at any of the MGM restaurants, but we did have drinks more than once at Whiskey Down (I had several very friendly waitresses there), watched Sunday football at Centrifuge (buckets of beer for $25 and much more comfy than the sports book), and watched several sporting events at the sports book (again I had several nice waitresses there). Taxi lines were non-existent so you walked out the door and into a cab. Plus getting to and from the airport is super easy and around $10-13 depending on traffic.   As a tip, if you are heading out to walk the Strip or just want to buy cheap beer without paying $8+ for it or gambling, walk to the sports book, make a right, and go out the doors in that area. There is a convenience store when you walk out where you can get $3.50 24 oz cans of beer to take with you while walking. Also it's a good shortcut to get directly onto the Strip.

After a disappointing experience at Onda the night before, we were hoping Mon Ami Gabi would live up to our expectations and it certainly did! We had a great dinner and would definitely go back next time we are in Vegas. We went with a group of 13 on a Saturday night and had 6 pm reservations. Our server was really nice and joked around with us. Plus the fact that at the end of the night he was willing to do seperate checks and split it anyway we wanted was really cool of him.  My husband and I split the cheese plate for an appetizer...the St. Andre triple cream was by far my favorite of the three cheeses on the plate.  The Fleur de Marquis was OK and the blue cheese was probably my least favorite.  For dinner, I just had the crab cake appetizer. The crab cake was full of jumbo lump crabmeat and did not have much filler at all...in short, it was delicious.  The only part about the crab cake appetizer I did not like was the celery root remoulade.  I didn't care for the flavor and didn't feel that it complimented the crabcake well at all.  My husband had the seared sea scallops which he graciously let me try.  They were awesome...cooked perfectly as opposed to the disgusting ones I had at Onda the night before.  For dessert we had the chocolate mousse which was good and a perfect way to end the meal.  My only real negative is that if you have to use the restroom, you have to leave the restaurant and go around the corner back near the sports book to the bathroom there.

I've been to Mon Ami Gabi three more times since my initial review and this has definitely become my go-to restaurant when I'm in Vegas and I want a guaranteed good meal for a moderate price. If you can, I highly recommend dining on the patio - you can't request it when you make a reservation, but when you check in, they will ask.   My favorite dish is the sea scallop dinner - I've had it twice and it has not disappointed. The scallops are always cooked perfectly and you get six. The scallop appetizer was fine, but the entree is by far the better choice. The baked cheese appetizer which I had this past weekend when I dined at Mon Ami Gabi with two friends was a big winner with our group, but how can you go wrong with goat cheese and tomato sauce? I am not a big dessert person, but the chocolate mousse is amazing.  Service is always very friendly and attentive. When my friend's steak on Saturday night wasn't cooked exactly how she wanted, our server got it taken care of right away. Before tip, I always seem to spend around $40 which includes wine (either a glass or a portion of a bottle), my meal, and maybe a portion of dessert. I never leave disappointed and will go back to Mon Ami Gabi on another trip.

I am upgrading V Bar to four stars after my visit on Saturday evening with my sister. This lounge was better than I remembered. After dinner at Lavo and some gambling at the Palazzo, we walked over to V Bar for some drinks. It was a little after 9 pm when we arrived and walked right in and settled down at the bar. Service was quick and really friendly for the couple of hours we were there, and our five drinks cost me $51 after tip (3 cocktails and 2 beers). This is a great lounge for couples and groups since there is plenty of seating at the bar and at their U-shaped tables. The music mix was great and not loud enough where you had to yell to be heard.  I don't remember V Bar having hookah last time I was there a few years ago, but they have it now and have quite a list of flavors. My sister is a not a smoker so no hookah for me this trip, but I will definitely keep it in mind for my next trip out to Vegas.

My husband and I ended up at Bungalow tonight because we wanted to watch both the Giants/Pats game and the Alamo Bowl (Penn St/Texas A&M), and after attempting to watch the games at Upper Deck (apparently there was a PSU alum event there and quite a contingent of Kansas bball fans...WTF??), we decided to head over to Bungalow. It was a great happy accident!  Our waitress was incredibly attentive, very friendly, and not pushy at all. The beer list was pretty small for a bar, but whatever...our Bud Light bottles were only $3 so that was good to us.  The menu wasn't huge, but almost all of it (minus the burgers as I don't eat red meat) sounded yummy to me.  My chicken caesar wrap was pretty good, although I would have liked a little more dressing on it.  The fries were delicious...they were crispy with a slight hint of seasoning.  My husband had the Kamikaze burger and he thought it was pretty decent.  Like Kristin S., I was expecting a "Tiki" like atmosphere (a la Drift) but was pleasantly surprised.  It definitely has a lounge type atmosphere, but luckily for us there was plenty of TVs for sports watching :)  I will definitely go back, especially as a first stop in a night of Old Town bar hopping.

For my first Vegas club experience, TAO was great.  We went for a friend's birthday, so our group of 11 did bottle service. I don't think I would go to TAO without bottle service because the dance floor was packed all night long and I couldn't imagine waiting in line to get in or at the bar.  Our table was tucked in the corner which made it intimate and at times I forgot we were in a very crowded Vegas club...plus the fact that we had a security guy who would escort us to the bathroom was awesome.  Our server was really nice and incredibly attentive and took very good care of our group.  The birthday girl and I were on the guest list so we went before the rest of the group...we got in line at a little before 10 and it didn't take long for us to get in.  The rest of our group when they arrived had no problems getting in and we were seated at our table by about 10:30ish.  Considering parts of the night are a little fuzzy, I am sure that it was a very good night :)

Last Friday night after drinking at Blush, the group I was with headed to Tryst before it opened. My friend and I were on the guestlist and left our husbands and our other male friend to their own devices to get in. We were waiting in line chatting with the two guys behind us who happened to be from Phoenix as well, when this guy with a clipboard came up to us and led my friend and I to the front of the line. We were practically the first two people in the club. Our husbands and male friend had no problem getting in, and my husband didn't take any cash from me, but he was able to use our debit card to pay his $30 cover.  Now with all the drinking in the room, drinking at dinner, and drinking at Blush, the night at Tryst is a tad fuzzy for me. The inside was really swank and I could totally picture doing bottle service there the next time I am in Vegas. We spent most of our night on the outdoor patio which I am glad we did. I don't remember buying drinks, although from the pictures I always had one in my hand, so I can't comment on prices. We did leave around midnight or 1 am when Tryst was incredibly packed. The music was good, but not great from what I remember, but the group I was with made the night so fun.

I ventured up to North Scottsdale for the UYE because I like hanging out with Yelpers and I've been wanting to try Tapino. Like Gabi said, since we sat in Vino Lounge, I'll post my review here.  It's so cozy and relaxing on the outside patio and the light, airy curtains give an illusion of privacy and seclusion which is a nice touch.  Our server January was incredibly sweet and attentive, and made us feel right at home.  The $5, $5, $5 happy hour special is good for wines and martinis, but not so great for tapas. I found the $5 tapas selections a tad luckluster as I believe there were only about five choices, none of which appealed to me.    I had the sauvignon blanc which was delicious and my husband tried both a pinot grigio and a wild berry martini. He thought the pinot grigio was just OK, but really enjoyed the martini, which he let me sample (it was good). For food, my husband had the duck confit tostadas (part of the $5 tapas deal), which he described as average.  I had the fromage d'affinois, which was really creamy and extremely delicious! I only wish they gave you more bread because I ran out before finishing the cheese.  Gabi let us try some of her scallops and they were very good as well...incredibly tender and moist. My bite literally melted in my mouth.  For dessert, we tried the chocolate debauchery (chocolate creme brulee, lava cake, smore, and truffles). Most of what I sampled was good (not too rich), but I found the lava cake a tad on the dry side. I would have preferred it to be more moist and gooey.  I give it 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up to 4 because of the relaxing atmosphere and good service.

I've only hiked the Cholla Trail because the two times we have gone to Camelback, we have not been able to find parking in the super small lot at the Echo Canyon trailhead.  For the Cholla Trail, you have to park on Invergordon and then walk to the trailhead.  The first time we went to Camelback, we only had an hour...definitely not enough time so we barely made it halfway before having to turn around.  Today, we conquered Camelback and made it to the top!   Lessons learned from hiking Camelback: *Wear good hiking shoes...they will come in handy *Bring lots of water...one water bottle is not enough *Bring snacks to munch on while you enjoy the view when you reach the top *Going down is just as tough as going up...your knees will feel it *As you get closer to the top, it becomes less hiking and more climbing *If you like people watching, you will love Camelback. I swear we saw all different kinds of people, and quite enjoyed overhearing a couple of guys trying to pick up some girls at the top.   *According to some hussy at the top, Barry Sanders girlfriend is a bitch. Good to know. (She was bragging to some guys how she's met NFL players before) *Enjoy the view from the top. You worked hard to get there, so take some time and relax. *I will never never never be the woman who gets to the top of Camelback and then drops and does 25 pushups. Not.Going.To.Happen.Ever. *Somebody should open a beer stand at the top of Camelback. I think they would make a lot of money.  I know as soon as we reached the top, I said, "I want a beer." *I feel grateful that I have good genes that graced me with long legs. They came in handy. *Being thin does not equal being in shape. I'm getting my ass to the ASU gym and signing up for a membership this week!  It's amazing that a place like Camelback exists in a major metropolitan area, but it does.  I plan to take advantage of it as much as possible while we live out here!

What more can be said about Fez? In short it's a fantastic restaurant in Central Phoenix with yummy-looking waiters, attentive bartenders, delicious food, and the magnificant Thomas S.!  A few Saturday nights ago, my husband and I stopped in Fez for dinner. I had the rosemary chicken sandwich and the rosemary and garlic fries (instead of the side salad)...I am still dreaming about my meal. The portion size was right-on (just the right number of fries) and I liked how the sandwich wasn't super thick. My husband had a few bites and he loved it as well. He had the the lemon caper tilapia and the sweet potato fries. He ate every bite and gave it his seal of approval. I've also tried the pesto caesar salad for lunch and it was really good as well. The half size was perfect for me.  Fez has a great atmosphere and is a great place to pop into just for a drink or two. We've sat at the bar a few times and the bartender remembered us from the first time and even remembered what beer I had been drinking. Little things like that really impress me and why Fez gets five stars from this girl.

Have to write a quick update because this week I visited FEZ twice with my in-laws since they are in town. After picking them up from the airport, I took them to FEZ for brunch - this was my first time trying the brunch and I can say for certain that I will be back. Loved my breakfast panini and it was just the right amount of food. My in-laws loved the frittata and eggs benedict.  After being wowed by brunch, my in-laws insisted on going back for dinner. The $5 martinis on Tuesday night were awesome - my mother in law is determined to figure out the apricot martini so she can make them at home! As always the FEZ burger, the rosemary chicken sandwich, and sweet potato fries were delish. According to my inlaws the lamb kisra was great and heated up well the next day for lunch.  FEZ is still the go-to place for good food, good atmosphere, and good people.

Since my husband was out of town for Thanksgiving and because I don't like turkey or most other Thankgiving food, a girlfriend and I decided to go out to dinner for Thankgiving. We chose Bobby's because it was one of the few places we found that in addition to a special Thanksgiving menu, they were also offering their regular menu. Apparently quite a few other people had the same idea as us because when we arrived for our 4 pm reservations, both the downstairs and upstairs had significant crowds.  We were seated upstairs which is the lounge. The lighting was perfect and my friend and I both enjoyed the metal chain curtains that surround the space. The piano player was amazing and set a great tone for the space and our meal. Plus anytime I get to hear good Billy Joel covers, I am happy! Service was good - when we asked a busboy for olive oil as our table didn't have any, he was quick to get it for us and our waitress was very sweet and did a great job despite being double or triple sat.  On to the food...my friend and I both started with the caesar salad which was a good way to start our meal. My only complaint is that it came with anchovies on it - now I have ate many a caesar salad in my day and most places that serve it with anchovies list that they do in the menu, so it was quite a surprise when our salads came out with anchovies since it wasn't stated in the menu. Being one not to complain over something so minor, I picked them off and ate every bite of the salad - I especially like the seasoned croutons. For my dinner, I had the pesto chicken sandwich which was really good. The chicken was perfect and the sandwich was quite thick, so I wasn't able to finish it all. I especially liked how they used mozzarella on the sandwich which I think gave it just that little extra umph to make it really good. My girlfriend enjoyed her scallops that she ordered - she said they were cooked well and were not too chewy at all. For dessert we shared a slice of yellow cake with a cheesecake type filling. DELICIOUS! Despite being a tad full from our dinners, we still managed to eat every bite. Our bill came to $88 before tip (we also each had a glass of wine) which we did not think was bad at all.  If you are in the Kierland area, Bobby's is a nice choice for a meal or even just to stop in to have a drink or two. I would recommend sitting upstairs as I liked the atmosphere up there quite a bit, and if you were downstairs, I think you would just be a bit too separated from the music and ambiance the establishment is trying to project.

After a disappointing outing to The Bank, my husband and I decided we weren't ready to head back to our hotel, so at my suggestion we headed to Caesar's to check out Shadow Bar. This saved our night!   Sure, the girls dancing behind the screens are a bit kitschy, but it's Vegas! There is a ton of seating - probably the most I have seen at a Vegas lounge/bar. The music was awesome the two hours we were there...lots of r&b, rap and pop; way better than what we had heard earlier that night at The Bank. Our server was awesome and kept coming back to check on us even though it was pretty crowded most of the time we were there. My husband's beer was $7 and my rum and coke was $12.75, so prices are a bit better than clubs and some other lounges.  Great place for a few drinks in a relaxing atmosphere. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the vicinity or on my way to or from Pure, I will definitely pop in Shadow Bar again.

It may have taken fifteen months for my husband and I to make it back over to Chelsea's Kitchen, but it was definitely worth the wait. We brought some friends visiting from Ohio to Chelsea's Saturday night for dinner and all four of us left full and happy. When we arrived, we were told if we wanted to sit on the patio, we could be seated immediately, but for inside there was about a 10 minute wait. We decided to wait and sure enough about ten minutes later we were sat at a table.   We skipped appetizers to save room for dessert after reading the menu. The beer selection is small as a warning. For dinner, our friends had the salmon special and the ribeye tacos. They both enjoyed their meals, although the salmon special was just a piece of salmon and a small spinach salad. No rice or anything else with it. That was a bit disappointing. My husband had the halibut special which came with rice and a vegetable - a much more substantial plate than the salmon special. He really liked his choice. I had the fried chicken and mashed potatoes - yum! The chicken was moist and delicious, and the breading was not over powering or greasy as sometimes it can be with fried chicken. The potatoes could have been a bit more whipped, but they still were amazing. On my previous visit to Chelsea's, I had the caesar salad which was good.   The four of us decided to split two desserts so we had the chocolate destruction (chocolate mousse cake with an oreo crust) and the ice cream sundae. For the sundae, they basically brought you a sundae bar to the table - you get a side of caramel, side of hot fudge, sprinkles, chocolate and peanut butter chips, crushed oreos, and nuts - which I think is a great idea. The chocolate mousse cake was heavenly and I'm so glad we all split it or I would have devoured it myself.  Parking at Chelsea's is complimentary valet. The food is good and when it's a reasonable temperature out, the patio is nice to sit on (we ate on the patio the first time we visited Chelsea's). Definitely a solid restaurant - I just wish we made it over to that area more.

After dinner at SW, our group decided to have some drinks at Parasol Down (located conveniently steps away from SW) before heading to Blush. What a great little lounge. The view of the waterfall and outdoors is comforting and a nice backdrop for some casual drinks with another person or a group. Our waitress was nice and very prompt. If you are in the Wynn and want to unwind, this is a great place to do so. Although we only drank and relaxed at Parasol Down, I would definitely return to visit its upstairs sister, Parasol Up, the next time I am in Vegas and want a chic lounge.

Food-meh Beer-good Atmosphere and music-awesome  I will go back to Rosie's for the music and beer, but not the food. My husband tried the "award-winning" fish and chips and said they were a 7 out of 10 and that he has had better at other Irish pubs.  The area where the bands play is pretty small and cramped, so go a bit early to get a seat at the bar or one of the tables near the stage area. It does give it the intimacy of the pubs in Ireland which is nice, but I wish it would have had a small dance floor area because some Irish tunes definitely get you up wanting to dance a jig :)

Sleek and sexy were the two words that sprang into my head when my  husband and I went to Caramel. We went the night before 4th of July at around midnight and it wasn't very crowded. We sat at the bar, even though there was plenty of seating throughout the space. The interior is dark and well decorated and arranged with a variety of seating options. There was definitely enough room to dance if the mood struck  you. I ordered an expresso martini which was delicious and my husband stuck with beer. The music was spot on, and while it was loud, it wasn't loud enough where we couldn't carry on a conversation.  Caramel is a nice alternative when you want a chic, upscale spot to drink without the craziness of the clubs. I will definitely be back my next trip to Vegas.

Zuma is our go-to place on Mill when we want a cheap dinner and drinks. The food is decent for bar food and the menu is quite varied with burgers, salads, wraps, sandwiches and appetizers.  Service is always good, especially if you get there before 9 pm, as it is never crowded even on a Saturday night before then.  The thing my husband and I like best about Zuma are the cheap drink prices. $2 Miller Lite, $3 Sam Adams, and then they have a "power hour" on Friday and Saturday nights from 9-10 pm where you can get 2 for 1 drinks and $4 appetizers.  Last night we had 7 beers and dinner and our bill was $28. Holy crap, that is awesome.

Maybe I like Zuma because we go early and leave early and are never there for the annoying crowds. But seriously, this is still our go-to place on Mill for cheap drinks. It was the first place our group hit up on Saturday for the pub crawl and it did not disappoint in the cheap category. $2 Miller Lite bottles and $3 Zuma Juice were the drinks enjoyed by my husband and I. Chris said the Zuma Juice (vanilla vodka, cherry vodka, cherry juice, sprite and redbull) was like drinking Kool-Aid. Also on special were $4 Skyy and RedBull and $5 Jagerbombs.  So for $13 (before tip) Chris and I enjoyed five drinks. Also, service at Zuma whether you are at the bar or a table is always fast if you go early. Even though it was logical on how our group was split (three couples), our waitress still took the time to keep everything seperate and gave each couple a bill instead of having us have to figure it out. Not a bad daytime/early evening option on Mill, but I definitely wouldn't go late at night.

My husband and I met some friends up in Las Vegas this past weekend and we decided Saturday night was going to be our "club" night. Our friend really wanted to go to The Bank...this wasn't our first choice, but since he had traveled further than us, we obliged. We were all sorry we had wasted our time and money here.  First, it's a clusterf*ck to get in. I've been to other clubs in LV and some are super organized with actual lines. Not The Bank. It's just a hoarde of people waiting to get picked to be let in pushing their way to the rope. Thankfully, I'm pushy so I worked my way up to the front, and since we had a 1 to 1 guy to girl ratio, we got in within 10 minutes of the club opening. When you get in, you go up the escalator and walk down a bit of a hallway to the bars and the main area. I quickly noticed a sign about a bar on the other side, so I directed my three companions to it. It was a great idea because not many people were over there (guess they missed the sign). Service the whole time we were at the club was super quick at that bar. Drinks were typical LV prices - $9 for beer and $14+ for mixed drinks.  Now the main reason my husband and I like to go to clubs is to dance. Haha, good luck at The Bank. The dance floor is barely existant and was super crowded by 11:30. We gave up trying to dance and hung out upstairs along the railing for a little bit. The music left a lot to be desired - house to start and then crappy r&b and rap.   Between the bad music and not being able to dance, we left The Bank about 90 minutes after we got in. There are much much better clubs in Las Vegas.

On my recent trip to Vegas, I made sure to carve time to go down to the Wynn to visit the Manolo Blahnik store. Like most other girls my age, I have been lusting for a pair of Manolos since Carrie Bradshaw made them popular on Sex and the City. While you can buy Manolo Blahnik shoes at Neiman Marcus, Saks, and a few other stores, there are only two MB stores in the country - one in New York City and the one at the Wynn.  The store is not hard to find - if you get dropped off by a cab at the Wynn, walk toward the Esplanade and make a left when you get to Chanel. The store will be a few down on the left. Hamid was the sales associate working the morning I was there and he was excellent. Exactly what I want in a sales associate - greets me when I enter, lets me walk around the store slowly while deciding which pair of shoes to try on, and then is extremely helpful once I make that all important decision. He really took the time to make sure that the shoes I was going to buy fit properly which I really appreciated.  When I left the store I was extremely happy and about $600 poorer thanks to the gorgeous gunmetal heels I bought. I will definitely be visiting this store on a future visit to Vegas!

I love that even though Ticoz-Fez-Switch are owned by the same person, each has a distinctive style and atmosphere. After our visit to Ticoz on Saturday evening, I would say that Ticoz is FEZ's sexy Latin sister! Loved the dark amber tones that decorated the interior, and even though we sat in the main dining room, we peeked in the bar area and it looked very inviting. Our server was super nice and pleasant, and paid us just right amount of attention. We arrived a little after 7 on the Saturday night and were seated right away. The only real negative about Ticoz is that you can miss it if you don't know exactly where it is because it's not in a well lit area and, even though there is one sign near the street, you can easily miss it.  I had the watermelon sangria to drink and it was delicious! It was like drinking a watermelon jolly rancher, and I liked that it came with a slice of watermelon which I enjoyed after I finished my drink. We split the calamari appetizer...while it was not to die for, it was still better than what I imagined getting in the desert; plus the breading was very light and the appetizer was only the rings and no yucky tenticles, so kudos to that! I had the chicken torta sandwich with waffle fries as my entree. The sandwich was a great size and the chicken was so tender. Their were two things I didn't like: one was that the sandwich came on grilled flatbread - I would have preferred another bread option and second, with the fries and cole slaw, it was just way too much food. It barely looked like I ate anything even though I ate the whole sandwich and quite a number of fries, which were tasty. Chris had the chicken tamales which he really enjoyed.  Our bill came to $49 before tip. We used the $10 gift certifcate Chris won at the Fez UYE so after that was deducted and we added tip, our total was $50. Not too shabby at all. We'll definitely be back in the future to sit at the bar and enjoy some more good food.

I've been a member at Planet Fitness since April and I love it. It's small so you see the same people there everytime you go if you have a consistent schedule, and there are very few meatheads grunting and trying to impress everyone with how much they can lift. The staff is super friendly and always willing to help people out by showing them how to use a specific machine...although I'm not sure why people need a tutorial on how to use an elliptical or treadmill, but that is just me.  I pay $15/month and it is automatically debited from my account mid-month. There is nothing fancy about this gym...just cardio machines with a box that you can plug your headphones into so you can get the sound from whichever TV you select, free weights, and weight machines. No pool, sauna, classes, etc. It's just a gym which is all I need and want.  Even when it's "crowded", there is never a wait for machines or cardio equipment. Weekend mornings are pretty quiet, as are the days near the holidays. I've also noticed it's less crowded when ASU is not in session. All and all, a great place to workout especially since it within walking distance of my apartment.

Both times I have been to U of P Stadium it has been for college football games and both times Ohio State lost (I'm thinking the Buckeyes are cursed there). Despite that, I have had good experiences at this stadium. We sat down low (100 level) on the 40 yard line and had excellent views of the entire field and the large scoreboard during the BCS Championship. During the Fiesta Bowl on January 5, 2009, we sat in section 403, row 15 on the aisle and again had great seats. We had an amazing view of the entire field, which I was surprised by being in a corner section. Also, while we were in the 400 level, we were not that high up at all. The only negative about section 403 is that you can not see the large scoreboard and have to rely on the very small screen at the opposite end. Parking last night for the Fiesta Bowl was 1000% better than during the National Championship game - it feels like they figured out how to get cars out of the Blue lots within minutes, which is great. We were out of the lot within two minutes of arriving back at the car.  Security lines were pretty long an hour before the game, but they moved quickly. The escalators are not that well marked when you walk in, but once you find them, it's pretty quick to get to your seats. When my sister and I went to get concessions prior to the start of the game, we walked right up and were back in our seats within five minutes. Plus the cashier only charged me for my beer ($8.25) and not the fries, so that was sweet! For both games I attended, I found the bathroom lines to be short which I attribute to the fact that there are numerous facilites spread around the stadium.  I'm anti-football and baseball in domed stadiums and U of P stadium does not change that opinion. However, that does not take away the fact, that they seem to do a good job hosting events. I was quite taken aback both times on how chilly U of P stadium is being a domed stadium though. I hope to return next season for a Cardinals game to get a true sense of the atmosphere in the stadium.

On Sunday, my friends and I were at the Bellagio searching for a casual place to grab lunch - we ended up at Cafe Bellagio due to a recommendation by an employee of the hotel. After waiting twenty minutes for a table when there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant, we were about to give up, but stuck it out. I wish we hadn't.  Service was extremely slow and I thought the prices were too high for the quality of food you received. My BLT sandwich was practically inedible due to the type of bread used for the sandwich. The fries were super greasy and you could taste the oil and greasy - and not in that good way. My friends were not overly impressed with their meals and we all left feeling like we would have just been better off to going to Subway.  I would not recommend eating here at all. There are so much better places on the Strip for a casual lunch.

Wow, what a hike! Like Camelback, Piestewa Peak is a workout! And like Camelback, it is as hard going down as it was going up.  The top provides a perfect 360 view of the Valley, but yesterday it was pretty smoggy, so seeing downtown was a tad hard. Even still, a great view. I found Piestewa to be much more peaceful at the top than Camelback...probably because there weren't a ton of people up there when we made it to the top. However, my peaceful thinking at the summit was interrupted by a man who decided this was the best time to make a speech about his best friend...who just happened to be Jesus.  We hiked the Summit Trail and while there were definitely a lot of people there since it was gorgeous out yesterday, it didn't feel as crowded as Camelback and there were times where it was just me and my husband. Close to the summit are handrails, which come in handy on the way down.  Parking was 100% better than Camelback...plenty of spots and the turnover was pretty quick at the lot at the Summit Trail trailhead. It looked like there were other lots nearby, so parking is not a chore like it is at Camelback.

I stopped in Sauce today for lunch to take a break from shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square...it was a great choice.  Sauce is a good place if you want lunch while you are out shopping, but don't want typical mall food court options.  It's similar to a place like Pei Wei, where you place your order at the counter and your food is brought to you at a table.  I ordered the grilled cheese panini (mozzarella, fontina and cheddar), a slice of cheesecake, and a glass of Riesling.  My total was $15 for those three items, so not too bad at all.  The sandwich was delicious...the cheeses were melted together perfectly and they all complimented each other very well.  The cheesecake was nothing spectacular...not bad, but not amazing.  My friend's salad looked delicious, so much so that a woman came over and asked her about it.    My only two negatives about Sauce are: *the wine list was a bit lacking for a place that says it's a pizza and wine place...I think there was only like six choices or so for wine. *you can't take your wine outside, according to the guys behind the counter. So if you want to eat outside, don't order any wine.  We saw people outside drinking beer, so I'm not sure what the complete story is.

We met some friends who just moved to the Valley at Olive and Ivy last Tuesday night for some drinks and food. For a Tuesday night it was really crowded, but I attribute that to the Insight Bowl being the next day which prompted an event nearby that brought many people to the SFS area. We were the last in our group to arrive and we were at a small table near the bar area - definitely if you have more than three to four people, get a larger table! It was still cozy and chic...loved the ambiance and feel of Olive and Ivy. One negative is that it does get very loud, so hearing the person across the table from you can be a challenge at some points.  Our server was very nice and helped us make some drink selections. The sauvignon blanc she recommended I get was excellent. I had the pesto flatbread which was delicious...it was the perfect size I thought. Chris had the proscutto and fig flatbread and he liked it, although he said he could have preferred a little more goat cheese and a little less fig. I also had a caesar salad, which was average - nothing to rave over. Our other dining companions enjoyed their flatbreads as well. Our group's only complaint was that the timing of the service of the food was off...our friends had ordered the calamari appetizer and I asked for my salad to be brought out first and our flatbreads arrived first! A minute later, the calamari and salad were brought out...it was entirely too much food for our little table, but due to our ingenuity we made it work. Our group of five's bill came to about $160 which included four flatbreads, a salad, calamari and a handful of drinks.  They do offer valet, but with the parking garage at Nordstrom's so close as well as the Waterfront parking garage, I am not sure what the point is of the valet. Olive and Ivy is definitely a place I see myself returning to meet some girlfriends for drinks or a place to eat lunch while out shopping at SFS.

Ditto Mr. K on his review. I can't get over how nice, friendly and accommodating our two servers were...I'm pretty sure the kitchen stayed open a little later just for our group which was so nice. Not very many places will do that.  Plus, the fact our waitress was super cool with us canceling a wing platter was really nice.  I probably shaved a few years off my life expectancy with the amount of greasy and fried food, especially those yummy onion rings, I put in my body but oh well. My pesto cheese bread was good, although I would have liked a little more pesto. I'm looking forward to eating it for dinner tonight.  The decor and look of the restaurant didn't really fit the type of food they serve, but oh well. 4 stars for really friendly service and fried food as that is what we were searching for.

Since my two girlfriends and I were staying at the Mirage and had walked by Japonais quite a few times over the weekend, we decided to give it a try and we are so glad we did. The concierge made us reservations for Saturday night at 7:30 pm. The restaurant was not overly busy which allowed us to experience first class service and impeccable food in a chic space. I loved the waterfall in the far corner and thought the lighting was perfect, although one table near us did complain about a spotlight.  We tried:  Crispy Shrimp and Salmon Roll - enjoyed by my dining companions very much (I skipped it as I don't enjoy sushi)  Calamari - loved the flavor and thought it was very interesting that it came out in rectangles and not the rings and tentacles that I am used to seeing in other restaurants  The Rock - it's steak cooked on a hot rock. I've seen presentations in other restaurants like it, but maybe I'm easy to please, but it always amazes me. The rock only stays hot for about 6-7 min, so cook and eat fast. I don't even like steak very much and I really liked this dish due to the flavor of the marinate.  Crab cakes - my least favorite dish which makes me sad as I am a huge crab cake fan. My biggest complaint is that they cakes were a bit too "soft" for me...I prefer them to be a tad crispy. But it's personal preference I am sure.  Chicken robata - loved the rub on the chicken and thought the dish was moist and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The skewers were a tad hard to remove though!  Randolph Muller Riesling - nice flavor without being overly sweet. Perfect compliment to the all the dishes we tried.  Our bill came to $150 before tip; it would have been less but we sent the lobster spring roll dish to a table of four gentlemen at a table near us. Our waiter didn't think our request to do so was odd (we figured he had done it before!) and the guys said the spring rolls were delicious. Plus they ordered a bottle of red wine to share with us, so it worked out to our advantage.  Great choice for dinner, although next time I think I would like to sit in the lounge.

My husband and I frequent sports bars since we are both sports nuts and sometimes watching a game at home by ourselves is a little dull. Saturday afternoon we were starting to go a bit stir crazy at home, so we decided to check out Upper Deck Sports Grill to watch the Jag/Pats playoff game.   The only reason I am not giving this place one star is that there were tons of TVs with a variety of sporting events playing and I liked the two level idea. We sat on the second level at this mini bar that lines the balcony so we would have a great view of the two huge projection screens that were showing the football game.  Other than that, I have nothing positive to say about Upper Deck.  The service was horrific...my husband actually had to go to the bar on the second level to get our drinks and order our food because while there were waitresses walking around, they never came over to us.  The food was incredibly mediocre...I ordered the "kickin chicken wrap"...I am still trying to figure out what was kicking about it.  My husband got the chicken burrito and he didn't care for it.  The menu is really lackluster and not much about it envokes the sports bar idea.  The beer prices were a tad high for the most part, but our 64 oz. Bud Lite pitchers were $8.50 which we didn't think was too bad.  One of the most odd things about Upper Deck is the hodge podge assortment of universities or teams that claim the bar as their "viewing" place for games...Georgia Tech, Kansas, Virginia Tech, Michigan State, and the Philadelphia Eagles all had banners hanging up...weird.  What the common bond between them all is, I have no clue.  Needless to say, I will not be making a trip back to Upper Deck anytime in the future.

We ended up at dinner at StripSteak on Saturday night because of the Yelp reviews (thanks for not steering us wrong!), prix fixe menu options, and because StripSteak accepts restaurant.com gift certificates (we got a $50 gc for $6). When I made the reservation, I mentioned we would be celebrating a friend's birthday - while this didn't result in a free dessert, there was a card on the table when we sat down reading "Happy birthday" (handwritten).  Here is what we had:  *Duck fat fries with trio of dipping sauces (complimentary) - seriously we could have stopped here because they were really really freaking delicious. All four of us loved the truffle aioli dipping sauce the best. *Rosemary bread (complimentary) - soft and very good, but perhaps a little unncessary because of the fries *Maryland blue crab chowder - course 1 of the prix fixe for 2 of the 4 *Bibb Wedge salad - my prix fixe first course. It was the perfect size and had a good blue cheese flavor without entirely overpowering the whole dish. *Ribeye - course 2 of the prix fixe for two of the four of my group *Organic half chicken - my entree. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the truffle mac and cheese the chicken sat on was the perfect side, and the onion au jus gave the entire dish a good flavor. *Potato puree trio - order this for the lobster mash alone. You will thank me. *Beignets - 2 of us got the chocolate pot de creme and one got the creme brulee. The beignets were a good, light dessert to end an indulgent meal.  Service was outstanding. Our waitress was phenomenal - super friendly, helpful, and the right amount of attentive. Prices are what you would expect to pay at a good, upscale, fine dining restaurant. Our bill after using the $50 gc came to $313. It was worth every single penny.  I highly recommend checking out StripSteak when in Vegas.

This theatre is a great place to go catch a movie if you want to have dinner and drinks afterward on Mill Avenue. If not, you should go to another theatre. Also, if you don't like to fight crowds to watch a movie, then this would be a good theatre. It never seems very crowded.  First, no stadium seating. I think I'm spoiled because back in Ohio, all of our AMC theatres had stadium seating. The chairs were nice and comfy and made you want to snuggle in them especially if the movie was going to be 2+ hours. The Harkins on Mill has the old movie theatre seats, and I had to move around quite a bit during our 1 hour and 40 minute movie so my butt wouldn't fall asleep.  Second, only one concession stand was open and the selection was pretty limited. Prices were standard movie theatre prices...my medium drink was $4.00.  The worst part of this theatre is that because it is located so close to ASU, it means that annoying frat-tastic douchebags go to this theatre to watch movies. You know, the really annoying guys who a) feel that they are the only person there so they talk super loud before the movie starts, as if I really care about their sex life, b) talk incessently through the movie, as if I really care about their feelings on what is going on, and c) get up constantly during the movie because they probably snuck beer into the theatre and now have to go to the bathroom. The few times I have gone here to watch a movie, I have been stuck with these kind of guys in the theatre and it makes the experience horrible. I mean, if I'm already watching a crappy movie (ahem, Spiderman 3), I don't want to have it worsened with jerks chit-chatting through the movie.

After checking into the MGM, four of my friends and I decided to have a casual lunch at the hotel at the Wolfgang Puck Bar and Grill. It's an open restaurant on the casino floor and is easy to find. Service was quick and attentive which is always good, especially when four of your dining companions had been awake since 3 am EST and were dying for food.  We shared the truffled potato chips with Maytag blue cheese as an appetizer which were heavenly. For lunch, I had the caesar salad which was really good, especially because it came with a piece of bruschetta. The pizzas are big enough to share between two people, which is what two of my friends did. They actually got a half tomato, basil, and mozzarella and half pepperoni - needless to say every bite was eaten. The other big hit at the table were the ricotta gnocchi which everyone who tasted them enjoyed.  Prices are very reasonable; food was good; and overall it has a good atmosphere for a nice, casual lunch if you are at or near the MGM Grand.

As a beer lover and a person who likes to try different beers any chance I can, I totally dig The Lost Leaf. It's such a laid back place where you can go to sip on some beer, chat with whoever you are there with, and listen to some live music. Even with the live music, it's still possible to carry on a conversation which I appreciate. Beer prices seem to range from $3 to $10 just depending on what you get. The beer menu is quite lengthy, but beware that they may be out of what you want (I found this out this past Saturday night when we were there). However, the bartenders are super friendly and will offer up some other suggestions for you if they are out of what you initially wanted.   On Saturday night, I saw some people drinking wine, so you don't have to be a beer person to enjoy the LL atmosphere. But if you do love beer, LL is a must to check out.

We've been to Hail Mary's quite a few times this fall because it is an Ohio bar...Saturdays, they show the Buckeye games and then on Sunday, it's time for the Browns. In fact, it's one of the meeting places for the Browns Backers club out here. My husband is a huge Browns fan, so you'll find us almost every Sunday at Hail Mary's.  The food is pretty much typical bar food, but they serve Cincinnati chili which is another reason my husband likes this place. The chicken nachos is one of our favorite things to order, and with some beer, it makes the perfect lunch during a Sunday game.  Pitchers of beer are a bit pricey at $10, but they also have 32 oz beers for $5.  The owners are incredibly friendly and they socialize with the customers frequently.  Nice wait staff, although because of the crowds and small staff, the wait for service can be a bit long at times.  The restaurant, bar and patio have tons of TVs, so watching the games isn't a problem.  In the bar area, they will typically show one or two other games besides the Browns. The staff is very accommodating about turning on the game you want, which is nice.

$4 32 oz beers-check! $5 appetizers-check!  If those two things appeal to you, check out Boston's in Tempe during happy hour or anytime on a Sunday. There are quite a few TV's so watching the sporting event du jour is not a problem.  On Sundays, they play most, if not all, of the NFL games on so finding your favorite team won't be a problem.  And if they don't have the game you want on, they are extemely accomodating about changing a TV for you.  I've been to Boston's on Sundays to watch the NFL a couple of times now, and after almost 6 hours, you can't complain when your bill is less than $30.  The staff is very friendly and the clientele, especially on a Sunday, is quite lively and entertaining.    My husband and I had the chicken quesadillas as we watched one of the NFL games...wow, they were awesome.  Probably some of the best we have had at a sports bar.  The potato skins were numerous, but not overly impressive.  We haven't sampled the pizza yet...we'll save that for another trip.

It's been over two years since my initial Boston's review, so I figured it was time for an update. Boston's has been our go-to place to watch Sunday football for the past three football seasons. We always sit at the bar and have gotten to know the bartenders and waitresses that work Sundays. We have also gotten to know the other Sunday regulars. I guess you could say Boston's is our Cheers. Everyone knows our name.  32 oz Bud Lights are now $3 and appetizers are still $5 all day on Sunday (this is also their HH special during the week). Starting this year, doors now open at 10 am on Sundays during the first part of the football season. Of the food I have tried, I recommend the mozzamia, potato skins, baked cheese fries (a new addition to the menu), and Boston's Chicken salad with fried chicken (you can either get grilled or fried chicken).   Plenty of TVs dot the interior of the space so there is no excuse not to watch your game. In Tempe, I can't think of a better spot to watch sports.

I knew I was going to like Monkey Pants before I walked in the door when I saw the sign: "Today-free reacharounds for anyone wearing Suns gear." Sweet.  You will like Monkey Pants if:  *you want a multitude of TVs to watch various sporting events *you appreciate friendly bartenders *you want cheap drinks (my Stella drafts were $4.50 which isn't bad at all and my Bud Light draft was $2.50) *you like bar games (pool, shuffleboard, and board games are all available to play) *you like places with mixed crowds *you don't want to dress up to go to a bar (I'm pretty sure I could have rolled up in a hoodie, jeans, and flip flops and still have been overdressed) *you like obscure songs from the '80s (for some reason that dominated the jukebox selections last night) *you want to chill on a couch with a drink in front of a faux fireplace  Overall, Monkey Pants is not a place that takes itself seriously. It has a loyal clientele from what I could tell as the bartender seemed to know a lot of the folks who wandered in.  My husband and I will definitely be returning when we are in the mood for a few drinks, sports, and shuffleboard.

Nothing cures a hangover like indulging in more alcohol. After a late night of heavy drinking at Body English the night before, some of us were not doing so well but we had reserved chairs at Tao Beach, so we headed over there early in the morning. We sat at the bar for awhile and chatted with the bartenders who were very sweet and attentive. Drink prices were typical of most other bars in Vegas...the beers I drank were $7 and mixed drinks were around $12. There are cocktail waitresses who walk around to the chairs, but everytime I needed a drink I just went up to the bar as I was in the pool most of the day. The only food I tried was the french fries but they were delicious. However, I think I loved them a lot because I was hungover and needed something with a bit of grease to it to sop up the remaining alcohol that hadn't processed my body yet.  Most of the morning Tao Beach was pretty quiet but it really picked up in the early afternoon. Having reserved chairs was really nice and made the experience even better as they were in a really good location.  The pool isn't huge and got pretty crowded by the late afternoon, so definitely go early.  There was a DJ spinning music and the stuff he was playing ranged from old school to current hits. You can have alcohol around the pool, but don't wander away from the steps or edge of the pool with your drink because I saw quite a few people get yelled at for having their drink in the center of the pool.  All and all, Tao Beach was a blast. We were there for about six or seven hours and it was so hard to leave as we were having a blast.  The only negative is that if you have to go to the bathroom, you have to leave Tao Beach. You do get to skip the line when you come back though which makes it not as annoying.

Having lived in Tempe and walking distance from two light rail stations, I have ridden the light rail more times than I can count. I've ridden it to work, to the airport and home from Sky Harbor, to and from events at Chase Field and US Airways arena, and to go downtown or Central Phoenix for Friday or Saturday nights out with my husband and/or friends. The trains are always clean and I've never had to wait too long at any of the stations for the next train. The ticket machines are for the most part quick and easy to use; however, I have had a few problems with them not accepting the cash I have tried to put in even though it's not wrinkly or crumpled at all. This caused me to miss a few trains which at the time really ticked me off.  I don't mind the honor system that light rail employs, but is it really necessary to check tickets twice within two stops? Also, why check tickets when the trains are filled to the max before and after a baseball game? I know the trains are public, but I actually found being solicited on the train for petition signatures really annoying. As a woman who rode the train alone at night at times, I find light rail to be safe as the stations are well lit and there are never too many people on late at night. For the summer, can I put a request in now for misters??   The speed of light rail doesn't bother me either, as I really enjoyed using the time on the train to read or catch up on emails/ESPN/the news on my Blackberry. Thee ride from Tempe to the airport is about fifteen minutes and from Tempe to downtown (Central and Van Buren station) is about 35 minutes or so. Sure I could have driven in half the time, but the convenience of not having to drive and park at sporting events, work, the airport, etc, well makes up for the time. Additonally with the light rail running until 2 am on weekends, it's nice for when you want to have a few drinks and don't want to risk a DUI.  I hope that light rail eventually expands throughout the Valley as I think it's a great addition to the Valley. Plus anything that affords such fantastic people watching (both at the stations and on the train) is A-OK in my book!

I love how Kierland Commons is an outdoor mall...on a nice January day, it's so refreshing that when I want to go shopping, I can walk around outside and enjoy the beautiful weather instead of being trapped inside a mall.  Kierland has the stores I like to shop in, so it's easier to go there than have to deal with the Chandler Mall or Scottsdale Fashion Square.  On a Saturday morning, parking was extremely easy at Kierland and all of the stores were pretty empty.  I hate shopping where I feel as if I am tripping over people.  The Barnes and Noble is two stories and is quite large...the layout was kind of annoying to me though.  There are a few cute boutiques that are worth checking out, plus Banana Republic, Coach, Crate and Barrel, BCBG, J Crew, Victorias Secret, etc.  Even though Kierland is about a 20-25 minute drive for me, I will most definitely be shopping there when I want fresh air and the basic stores.

Success! BCBG is the go-to place for party dresses, no doubt about it.  The BCBG at Kierland is quite large...not quite the largest I have been in, but much larger than the one at BCBG. The store is neatly organized and easy to move around.  The party dress and more formal dress section is in the back and it is a bit cramped, so when a few people get back there groing through the racks, it's not super enjoyable.  The sales associate, Crystal, who helped me today was very nice.  I found a dress I really liked but needed a smaller size which was not on the racks.  I asked her if they had the smaller size in the back and she was happy to check for me.  Luckily they did have the size I needed and I walked away with a super fab party dress for Vegas.  The shoe and purse section is probably the largest of any BCBG I have been in.  The best thing about BCBG is that they run sales quite frequently, especially at the end of the season and you can find items up to 70% off.  I found quite a few casual dresses and tops while I was there that I am hoping to go back for in the near future.  If you are in the market for a cute dress or a party dress, make the BCBG at Kierland a stop. You will not be disappointed.

Thankfully Kristin S. gave me directions on where Uncorked was because it is hidden...heck, if she hadn't told me where to go, I might still be trying to find it.  The decor is very nice and the seating is really comfy.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful and after we were done eating and drinking, she didn't rush our group out which was nice.  However, I did feel that she could have come over a bit sooner to see if we wanted our bill, but perhaps I was just restless as I was starting to feel a cold coming on.  My Riesling flight was really good (OK, two of the three were really good) and it was reasonably priced.  I'm kinda glad I ate a late snack at work so that I wasn't super hungry because my cheese plate was just OK.  I ordered the white wine cheese plate, and two of the cheeses were good, but one of them (the name is escaping me currently) was disgusting. I love cheese so it makes me sad when I find a cheese I can't stomach.  I did appreciate the amount of bread, nuts and apples that came with the cheese.  Thankfully the company I was with made my trip to Uncorked well worth it.  I will definitely go back for a glass of wine or two, but not sure how eager I am to eat the food.

If Sol y Sombra were a person, I would marry it.  I would have to break out my thesaurus to come up with enough adjectives to say how simply awesome it is.  The inside is sleek, sophisticated, and sexy. The outdoor patio is a little oasis offering a view of DC Ranch. Service is impeccable...the waiters and bartenders are so friendly and very good at helping to make drink recommendations. My husband and I arrived a few minutes early for our group's 5 pm dinner reservation this past Saturday and didn't realize they didn't open until 5 pm. A staff member had ridden up in the elevator with us and said it was OK for us to come in, so we sat at the bar and saw the staff put the finishing touches before opening (it took me back to my waitress days). My husband ordered a beer while we waited and when we went to pay when our dining companions arrived, he was only charged $2.50 which was so nice.  The food and drinks are out of this world.  The wine list is comprehensive and offers something for everyone.  The Albarino is delicious...so delicious in fact that my clutch purse wanted some (I accidentally spilled some when I was there with friends...too many mojitos at the pool beforehand I suppose). There is a good beer selection, ranging from domestics to imports...they even have a Spanish beer made in Germany (Estrella).  The champagne I have tried is really good as well, as was this "Aqua" shot I tried.  The food itself is heavenly, although some things I liked one time were not as good this past time, and vice versa. By not as good, I mean only 4.5 stars as opposed to 5!  The dishes I have tried and loved include: tortilla espanola, pollo colonial (better the first time I had it), soft lettuce with manchego cheese and rioja vinaigrette (the vinaigrette gave the dish a great flavor), pan con tomate, calamari (I liked how there weren't many squidy pieces since those aren't my favorite), and the patatas bravas (better the second time I had them). My husband also tried the asparagus (really liked the romesco sauce that came with it) and the shrimp.  We had the poached apple for dessert this past Saturday and even though I swore I wouldn't have a bite, I caved...it was so good!  Even if gas gets to $6/gallon, I will still drive up to DC Ranch to eat at Sol. That is how good it is.

Yesterday I met three girlfriends at Sol y Sombra for brunch at noon. I had made a reservation, but when we arrived, it was apparent it was not necessary because the entire inside was empty and there was only one couple on the patio. By the time we left at 2 pm, only one other table on the patio was sat. I'm thinking that many people may not know Sol has brunch since they are only open for dinner every other night of the week.  The only disappointing part of Sol's brunch is that there are only two "breakfast" choices on the menu - almond french toast served with a side of maple syrup and a side of chocolate sauce and a egg, cheese and chorizo sandwich. We ordered both, as well as Sol favorites tortilla espagnola, artichokes, patatas bravas, gambas, and scallops. I liked the egg sandwich because it did not have a ton of chorizo on it, nor a very chorizo-like flavor (can you tell I'm not a fan of chorizo?). The almond french toast was really good and a hit with our group, although we all decided we preferred it with the maple syrup rather than the chocolate sauce. One of my dining companions had never been to Sol before (the other three of us had), but now she can't wait to go back for dinner.  The two best parts of brunch (other than the fabulous food) were $5 mimosas and the fact that we had a coupon for half off our brunch (my friend received it when she dined at Sol for NYE), so our total bill came to $57.

I had been wanting to check out Mix Lounge for a long time and finally got the chance this past weekend. The elevator up to the lounge is a bit hidden since it's tucked in a corner of THEhotel, but once you find it, it's a quick trip up to the 64th floor. Since we arrived about 6:45 for some pre-dinner drinks, Mix Lounge wasn't busy at all. We snagged a table nearest the windows facing the Strip and enjoyed some mixed drinks and beers while taking in the amazing view of the Strip lit up. Needless to say we got some amazing pictures. Service at the bar was quick and friendly and drink prices were typically of the other lounges and clubs on the Strip. The lighting and atmosphere of Mix Lounge, along with the stunning view, makes this my favorite lounge in Vegas. This is definitely a must to check out.

Two years after my first visit to MIX Lounge, I returned this past weekend with my sister. I knew I had to take her here on her first visit to Vegas for the incredible view of the Strip lit up at night. Luckily for us the balcony was open, so we were able to snag seats outside near the heat lamps to enjoy our drinks. Service at the bar was prompt and friendly, however, I did find the waitress service outside to be a bit on the slow side. Plus our waitress disappeared for long periods of time. But I can overlook that because I was too busy talking to my sister, people watching, rocking out to the eclectic mix of music they were playing that night (it ranged from 80s music to The Cupid Shuffle), and admiring the view. Before we left, I made sure that my sister checked out the bathrooms. It's quite funny to go to the bathroom while looking out at the Strip! MIX Lounge remains on my "must-do" list for friends that ask me for Vegas recommendations.

I have been to the lounge two more times since my last update. It has firmly solidified its place as my favorite place to have a few cocktails while in Las Vegas. The best part is that if you go see the Michael Jackson ONE show at Mandalay Bay, the elevator for MIX is only a few steps from the theater. How could you not go have a drink before or after the show then???  Service at the bar still remains quicker than sitting at a table, but definitely grab a table outside on the patio or just inside near the windows for the incredible view of the Strip lit up and all the photo ops it presents. Music remains a great mix that gets you signing along...well maybe just me singing along after a few rum and cokes :)  Enjoy the elevator ride up - it's a great preview for what awaits on you on the 64th floor!

I was in Vegas a few days before the 4th and staying at the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. After an afternoon by the pool, I decided to get a quick shopping trip in before dinner. I wandered down to the Miracle Mile shops and into the BCBG store. The store is very clean and well laid out....party dresses to the left and other clothes/shoes/handbags to the right. I did find there was a lot of wasted space in the store and it didn't have as much merchandise as I have seen at other stores I have been in.  If you shop at BCBG, then you know the stores are good at having awesome sales. The Miracle Mile store is no different...most items were marked down anywhere from 30-70% off. The summer dresses and party dresses were an additional 15% off the markdown price...sweet! The party dress selection was extensive, but finding my size was impossible. I did find a cute navy blue summer dress that ended up being 65% off, which made it an easier sell to my husband when I got back up to the room with my purchases.   The customer service was extremely lacking...after I finally was able to get someone to open a door to a dressing room, no one came to check on me or see if I needed a different size, which I did. I literally walked in the first dress to get a smaller size myself. Finally when I needed a smaller size again, a customer service rep helped me out and then rang up my purchase. She was very sweet and gave me lots of compliments. It was the worst service I have ever gotten at a BCBG store.  This is really a 3.5 star BCBG store, but since I walked away with a cute find at a really reasonable price, I'll bump it up to 4 stars. Not a bad store to pop in if you are looking for a cute dress to wear to a club that evening, but not the best I have been to.

We wanted a casual, yet fun, bar to chill at the Wednesday night before the 4th of July, which Nine Fine Irishmen fit. The space is mostly made up of tables with a small awkward space where you can stand and/or dance. We ended up standing, which was fine and allowed for easier bar access, which is always key.  The Irish band, with accompanying Irish step dancer, playing that evening was awesome. They played all my favorite Irish songs and I think did a few covers as the evening progressed. The crowd was mixed in age and, as I always find at Irish pubs, they were quite friendly. We chatted with some people around us and my brother-in-law did some shots with a bachelorette party that wandered in. We drank Harp and Smithwick that evening and I think each beer was about $6.50.   Nine Fine Irishmen is an upbeat and casual alternative to the lounge/club scene. My husband and I will definitely go back on a future Vegas trip when that is what we are looking for.

I hadn't been to this place in over five years, but ended up here on the last night of my most recent trip to Vegas. My husband and I were hanging out with two British guys I had met at the pool and convinced them that Coyote Ugly was not worth the money. They are glad we did because they loved Nine Fine Irishmen! We all had a great time dancing to the live band who did covers and classic Irish songs, as well as chatting with the other patrons in the bar that night (it was not super crowded since it was a Tuesday). I really do believe that people who go to Irish pubs are some of the friendliest people around! A round of four beers with tax and tip ran me about $40 which was not too bad in my eyes since we were getting Guinness, Harp, and Smithwicks.  This is a great stop if you are at or near the NY-NY Hotel and want a casual, laidback evening in a bar with live music.

I have had the pleasure of purchasing three pairs of shoes from this Jimmy Choo store. My first purchase was in March 2013 when I was in town with my sister and her best friend for a girls weekend. I needed a pair of silver strappy heels for our Saturday night out and I fell in love with the Lance shoe. One try on and $800 later, I was a happy girl.   In early October 2013 I purchased two pairs of shoes from this store. Originally I was at the JC store in Palazzo, but they did not have my size. One track-down and phone call later by Jessica (see my review for the Palazzo store) and I was on my way to the JC store at the Forum Shops. The burgundy Dane peeptoe booties that had been set aside for me fit like a charm. Of course while I was there, I spotted the black and silver Anouk heels that I had been coveting since seeing them online (they were not at either of the stores in Crystals or Palazzo). Twenty-ish minutes and $1800 later, I walked out with both pairs of shoes that I had been drooling over lately.   Customer service at this store is phenomenal. Jason helped me on my most recent visit and he was an absolute delight to work with. If he is working, make sure to have him help you! All the girls who rang me up on both visits were very friendly and made me forget how much I was spending. Also I have found the selection at this store to be superior to the one at Crystals and just slightly better than the one at Palazzo, even though its smaller than the Palazzo location.  If you are coming from the casino, this store is almost immediately on the right when you enter the Forum Shops area. You won't have to walk far which makes it so incredibly hard to resist!

LEMON PEPPER IS BACK! I don't know when it got re-introduced on the menu, but this seriously made my day.  Just for that, I am bumping this Pei Wei up to 4 stars. Quick service even when the line is out the door; friendly service; and delicious lemon pepper chicken. Pei Wei can now officially be added back to our lunch rotation.

An oasis in the desert. That is exactly what I thought of Jade Bar when I walked in and took a seat at the bar.  If I couldn't see the mountains in the distance or the cacti that are on the property, I wouldn't even realize I was in the middle of the desert.  The only unfortunate thing was that there were no seats available outside when we arrived a little after 6 pm on Friday night.  However, we were able to grab two seats at the bar which was fine with us.  All three bartenders working that evening were extremely friendly and we experienced very prompt service.  The specialty cocktails are $15 which normally would see expensive, but it's a swanky resort bar, so it makes sense that drink prices would be higher than your normal run of the mill bar in other parts of the Valley.  I had the "Hemingway special" which was rum, marischino liqueur, grapefruit juice and lime juice. It was delicious and perfectly made. The beer selection is nice and ranges from average domestic to my favorite imports. After my Hemingway special, I had a Stella Artois which was around $6.50 I believe. My husband had two Sam Smith drafts which he really enjoyed. Total for three beers and the Hemingway Special, our bill came to $37 without tip.  Of course, since this is a resort bar, there is awesome people watching to be done as well. We definitely enjoyed watching the guy at the end of the bar hit on two girls that sat down next to him. Jade Bar is a great spot if you are going to Elements for dinner, and is even a great spot on its own. I definitely see this as a place I will return to with my husband when we just want a low key night out or a group of girlfriends when we just want a relaxing environment to sit and chat.

After almost a year since my first trip to Jade Bar, I returned before dining at Elements. This time my husband and I brought my in-laws on their last night in Phoenix.  Jade Bar did not disappoint. Our server was incredibly friendly and even went searching for a fourth chair so that no one in our group had to stand. We all stuck to pretty basic drinks, but man, were the mixed drinks STRONG. I think there was just enough coke in my rum and coke to give the drink color. 4 drinks totaled $41.  Jade Bar is a nice pre-dinner spot or just a good place to relax while enjoying the views.

I met a group of girlfriends at Armitage last night for dinner and drinks. The space was charming and cozy and for most of the night, it was pretty empty, which was nice. Our server was nice enough, but I got the feeling from her that waiting on a group of 6 women was not her idea of a fun night.  Tuesday nights are half off wines after 8 pm, which is a good deal.  We had two bottles of the "Catching Venus" Sauvignon Blanc, which was a good wine...and when we ordered it half price, it was $22 for the bottle.  The menu looked divine, so I will definitely be going back to try everything I couldn't last night.  I had the cheese plate and there is an adequate selection of cheeses to pick from (for the small plate, you get your choice of three).  I chose the sharp cheddar (basic but delicious), brie, and chevre (my favorite of the three). The plate comes with a large amount of bread, some green apples, and a bowl of grapes.  I tried some of a friend's green apple and brie bruschetta, and I definitely did not enjoy it as much as the bruschetta at Postino.  The apple and brie bruschetta at Armitage didn't have enough brie on it for my liking and the flavor was a bit bland.    A great spot at DC Ranch and I can imagine on weekends it is quite the scene. I would recommend this spot during the week, but not sure I would trek up there on a Saturday night.

I met a group of women at Su Vino on Friday night for gossiping and wine...a great combination.  The inside is nice...a few high-top tables that can seat groups and a decent sized bar.  There are a few tables on the patio as well.  Friday is ladies night at Su Vino, so appetizers are half off, as is the 5 wine tasting (normally $10, but Fridays for ladies it is $5). If you do the tasting, you get a souvenir wine glass.  Bottles are also available for purchase.  Like Ashley A. said, if you are looking for dinner, Su Vino is not the place...there are a few appetizers and sweet desserts on the menu.  The dipping oil and bread was delicious....I liked how it was olive oil and vinegar and the caprese was tasty as well.  The cheese plate, on the other hand, was just OK. While I can't remember most of the names, the one cheese that had nuts in it was my favorite.  I did not enjoy the Irish Cheddar at all; the green apple cheese was interesting but I didn't enjoy it all that much; and the fourth cheese was just alright.  The five wines I sampled in my tasting were the fruity chardonnay (good); riesling (my least favorite of my five, which makes me sad because I love riesling); gewurztraminer (smooth and good); sauvignon blanc (my favorite of the five...it was delicious); and almond champagne (very interesting...I really liked it and it was my second favorite of the five I tasted).  Travis waited on us, and I thought he did a pretty good job, considering there were 7 of us partaking in the 5 wine tasting and most of the time we all ordered a different wine.  There is a sign off Main Street directing you to Su Vino and parking on Main on Friday night around 5:45 pm was not a problem at all.  You could definitely tell Friday night is ladies night because there was only one male customer sitting at the bar; the rest of the place was filled with groups of women.

I was with a group in Vegas last weekend to celebrate three friends' birthdays and both nights we ended up at the Wynn and started our nights of drinking at Blush. We went both nights right when it opened at 9 pm, so we were practically the first ones there on Friday and Saturday night. We were able to just walk in and not pay any sort of cover (I imagine there is a cover, but I am not 100% sure on that). The space is dark, sophisticated and sexy with the bar to the left and a large seating/dance area to the right. The outdoor patio was really nice as we were able to sit down and relax in the cool outdoor weather. Drink prices were typically Vegas...$10 for mixed drinks. Arriving right when Blush opened meant fast bar service and the bartenders we encountered were quick and pleasant.  I recommend going right when it opens to enjoy the space before it gets crowded. As much as I liked Blush, I couldn't imagine spending my whole night there.

Again, as a place to start an evening out in Las Vegas, Blush did not disappoint. Five of my group of eight decided to go to Blush before heading over to Body English and since we arrived a few minutes after 9, we were the first ones there and didn't pay cover. Mixed drinks will run you about $11 and beers around $9 - standard Vegas pricing.  If you go early in the night, they let you sit at any of the tables which we took advantage of by sitting outside. The outside area is definitely my favorite part of Blush. We stayed at Blush for about an hour and twenty minutes before heading over to Body English and when we left, there were maybe twenty people in the whole venue.   Again, not a place I would spend a whole night, but it's a great place to start a night out especially if you are over near the Wynn.

The reviews of the new C4 have done a really good job, so I will make this short.  I had never been there before, so I can't compare it to how it used to be.  My experience on Valentine's Day with a group of 10 was wonderful...very friendly server who did not mind answering all of our questions and knew quite a bit about the new menu; nice decor (loved the hanging crystal pieces); and, for the most part, good food. My husband and I split three of the appetizers for our main meal-crabcakes, sliders, and chicken quesadillas. I liked the quesadillas quite a bit and my husband enjoyed the sliders. However, I didn't like the crabcakes at all...I'm a very very picky crabcake girl and unfortunately I am still looking for good ones out here in the Valley.  There was no lump crabmeat in either of my cakes and they were too flat...I prefer fat and small cakes to big, flat ones. Plus the filler to crab ratio was much much too high.  I will say that I did enjoy the remoulade quite a bit though.  The desserts that I tried were delicious...the Mexican flourless cake was divine and I really liked the pop of spice.  The seven layer chocolate cake was moist and not too rich at all.   My husband and I found the prices very reasonable for the most part...the appetizers we ordered were all under $8 and it's hard to find that in most places nowadays.  We ventured up to the rooftop before dinner and it was beautiful. I will definitely be going back when it gets a little warmer out to enjoy music, the view and drinks up there with friends.

Imagine this: You are sitting at your desk at work and have just finished editing a document, so you hit "Print". You get up from behind your desk, realize your foot has fallen asleep and before you realize it, you are falling to the ground because you decided to wear cute heels that day. Thankfully no one was in the hallway so you are able to quickly crawl behind your desk and writh in pain.  Yes, that scenerio actually happened to me yesterday afternoon at work...who knew working in state government was so hazardous to your  health? After a night of elevating my ankle and icing it, the swelling still hadn't gone down and the pain had increased, so I decided to visit the NextCare just to make sure it wasn't broken. I filled out the check-in form online which was super convenient...I highly recommend doing this as it will save a lot of time. Within five minutes of submitting it, I received a phone call from a customer service rep asking which location I would be visiting and she also told me what documentation I needed (insurance card and photo ID).   I got there tonight and there was only one other person there. I got called back a few minutes after arriving and had my vitals taken by a very pleasant girl named Casey. The doctor who saw me (I didn't catch his name) was very nice as well and he checked my obviously swollen ankle and foot before ordering some X-rays. The tech who took my X-rays, Mark, was a very nice guy who was quick, efficient, and he apologized when he made me turn my ankle in a painful way. After the doctor confirmed my ankle wasn't broken, he gave me some instructions and sent me on my merry way.  So a $20 co-pay, 40 minutes, and a few X-rays later, I am happy to report my ankle is wrapped with hope the swelling will go down in a few days. I have to take 1 star off because there was no good people watching!!! I mean, part of the reason you go to places like NextCare is because typically you know you will see some "interesting" people. Darn you NextCare in Tempe for having a slow night with only normal people in there!!  Hopefully I will have no more walking incidents, but if I were in need again, I would return to NextCare in Tempe.

My sister and I had headed over to Planet Hollywood to try Earl of Sandwich on Saturday afternoon as we wanted something close by and not terribly expensive. Despite the massive line that greeted us when we arrived, it actually moved quickly and we waited for no more than 10-15 minutes before we were able to place our order.   My caprese sandwich was really good. I wasn't sure about it being classified as a "hot sandwich" on the menu when I ordered it (not really a fan of warm tomatoes) but it was really tasty. It was warmed just enough to crisp the bread and make the mozzarella even more tender. My sister loved her Earl's Club (turkey, bacon, cheese) as well. For the two sandwiches, two cookies, and two sodas, our bill was $21 which is not a bad price at all, especially since we left satisfied and full.   Since this is such a popular place, seating can be tricky to find, so be patient. Thankfully it's just a sandwich place, so turnover at the tables is pretty good as long as people don't linger once they are done. For a reasonable priced and good lunch in Vegas, Earl of Sandwich is a great option.

I finally went to Canal on Saturday night with two girlfriends for a girls night out in Old Town. Canal was a great choice for dinner and drinks to start the evening. We sat inside in a booth and during the night some ladies in another group decided to strut their stuff on the catwalk...ahhhh, only in Scottsdale! I loved the fashion shows being shown on three screens.  Our waitress was awesome on Saturday evening. She answered all of our questions, was very knowledgable about the menu and drinks, and paid the perfect amount of attention to our table. Our group of three split the scallop trio and the parmesan fries. Both were huge hits with the three of us. I thought the amount of fries we received was very generous, considering they were only $5. The scallops were cooked perfectly and it was a nice way to start our meal. I had the caesar salad as my dinner and it was the perfect size. My two friends both had the mahi-mahi tacos which they both really liked, especially since the fish was not fried. We all also really liked the cornbread that came in the bread basket because it had a bit of a kick to it.  The sauvignon blanc wine I tried was really good and reasonably priced at $8 for the glass. I also tried the Fuji Apple Martini which tasted incredibly fresh (our waitress informed us that they only use fresh fruit for their cocktails...no sugar or syrup additives thankfully) and was priced at $10. One of my friends tried the Strawberry Smash Martini which she really liked. Our bill was $128 which I thought was reasonable given the fact we had 6 alcoholic beverages, 2 small plates, a salad, and 2 entrees.  Canal was a chic space and we really enjoyed our dinner there. It is definitely a place I would go for dinner or drinks with my girlfriends.

If I were an undergraduate at ASU and/or under the age of 21, I would probably love Tempe Marketplace. It's got a lot of stores that those groups would love to shop in...GAP, Buckle, Pac Sun, Old Navy and Charlotte Russe just to name a few.  Plus there are a lot of restaurants and places to eat, which would be appealing I suppose.  The only reason I go to Tempe Marketplace is for Target and Best Buy because they are the closest to my house.  We tried the movie theatre over there last night...big mistake. Not only were there tons of teeny-boppers just walking around and "hanging out" (remember when you went to the mall and movie theatre in middle school and high school just to hang out?? god, I can't believe I ever did that), but parking was horrible, as it is ever time I go to the Marketplace.  Lastly, I don't find Tempe Marketplace walkable for such an "outdoor destination". Old Navy, Pier 1, Target, Famous Footwear are over here and the movie theater, restaurants, and mall type stores are way over there. It is way too spread out to just park once and then walk everywhere you might want to go.

On a recent girls trip to Vegas, I had the pleasure of seeing my first Cirque show in Vegas after 15 previous trips to Sin City. My friend's husband surprised her a few days before we left with tickets to LOVE since she is a huge Beatles fan, and figured that the rest of us would enjoy it, especially since it was free for us. We were very excited when we picked up the tickets at Will Call that we were in the fifth row!  I would recommend picking up your tickets during the day instead of right before the show to avoid the lines. Additionally get in line at least 30 minutes before the show starts so once they start letting people in, you can get a drink (they have some "themed" mix drinks for $17) and find your seat before the show begins.  The highlight of the show is definitely the music, and they incorporate all of the Beatles greatest hits. The costumes, staging, creativity, and choreography are all first-class as you would expect at a Cirque show; however, the reason people go to Cirque shows - the acrobatics - left something to be desired. Sure some of the stunts were truly breathtaking, but there was not enough acrobatics, and what there was got to be repetitive at times. I have seen better acrobatics in the traveling Cirque shows. However the atmosphere and use of music in LOVE is what separates this show from other traditional shows.  Nevertheless, the three of us had a great time at the 90 minute show. For Beatles fans, this is a great show to see; for those wanting a bit more pure "Cirque" I would probably steer them toward another show.

We stayed at the Palazzo this past weekend and had a great experience.  We have not stayed at the Venetian or the Wynn before, so I am not sure how it compares to them.  We booked the Palazzo through Priceline and only paid $140 per night when rooms were retailing on the Palazzo's website for $350 per night.  Check-in was incredibly smooth...we checked in a little after 3 and it took less than 10 minutes from the time we parked the car until we had a room key.  The room was incredibly spacious....the only negative was our view. We were on the back and had a rather unpleasant view of alleyways and service entrances for the different surrounding businesses and hotels.  Checkout went very smoothly as well, and the morning we were leaving, we arranged for late checkout which was not a problem at all.  The casino at the Palazzo is small and pretty basic, so it wouldn't warrant a stop unless you were staying there.  It's nice that it is connected to the Venetian, and there is elevator access to the Canal Shops and the Canyon Ranch spa.  My huge negative about the Palazzo is it was impossible to get a taxi on Saturday night a little before 6 pm.  In fact, we had to get a towncar because the taxi line moved incredibly slow and I think for 10 minutes, I did not see one cab pull up.  We had to spend more money than we wanted for towncar service, but it was necessary to make sure we weren't super late to dinner.  I would recommend that if you need a taxi, just walk over to the Venetian because your luck will probably be better there.  UPDATE (6/3/08): I was in Vegas this past weekend with some girlfriends and we booked the Palazzo via Priceline for $207/night.  Again, a very nice experience especially as we were able to get early check-in.  Upon arriving, we decided to check out the pool. Blah. Bad idea. It took us almost 45 minutes to finally get a cocktail waitress to come over despite asking five different employees to send one over. I understand it's a big area, but we never even saw a waitress walk around until she finally came over. Once we got her over to us once, she was good about checking on us continually.  There is a little cafe outside of the pool area where you can order food to go, but I did not find the menu very impressive at all. I think if you have a cabana, you must have a different menu (I think the same one as Tao Beach).  Personally I would skip the Palazzo pool and just head over to the Venetian for Tao Beach.

I'm sorry, I just can't take a wine and martini bar seriously that has something as gimmicky as pop rocks around the rim of the glass. Really? I also really don't like judgey bartenders. It's not your job to evaluate and critcize my drink choice...yes, I want an apple martini; no, I do not want your stupid cherry vodka, cherry juice, and pop rock rimmed martini that is $12.  Thankfully, once we got a table in the back, our waitress was really really friendly and accommodating. She mentioned that they were expecting a private party in about an hour and that we would have to move, but that she would make sure we got a table in the front area. We were there for over two hours and the private party didn't materialize.  The best part about sitting in the back area was that we were close to the bathrooms, which allowed for some stellar people watching.  The clientele is quite mixed, and some people made some interesting outfit selections for their night out.  The single bathrooms are a freaking joke...why do bars insist on having only one or two stalls in a bathroom when you know you are going to be busy? It's really frustrating. The music was quite interesting...I've never been to a bar where there were electric fiddle players and I used to live in Ohio!  Overall, Silver was just OK. I definitely wouldn't make a special trip downtown just to go there. I'm not even sure it would be on my top 5 list of places to check out after a sporting event, the theatre, or any other reason why I was downtown on a Friday or Saturday evening.

Great place downtown for lunch! The inside is very simple, but the menu is really good. You order at the counter and they call your number and you pick up the food. Prices are very reasonable...I believe my caesar salad and soft drink run about $7.  I would be interested in checking it out after work for happy hour sometime.  Plus, how can I not love a place owned by an Ohio State alumnus? :)

Great addition to Scottsdale shopping! I checked out the Mix Shops this afternoon...I liked how the little boutiques were connected, so I didn't have to walk outside between them (even though it was a gorgeous day out, so it wouldn't have been bad).  Plus, it's a very easy walk from the Fashion Square, so you can shop at the mall and then walk over to the Mix Shops, or vice versa.  Great selection of women's clothes...everything from casual to party dresses. The salesgirl who was helping me was very nice...helpful but not pushy or breathing down my neck.  I tried on four party dresses and unfortunately none of them worked out. The designers with clothes in the boutiques are exactly who I want, so I will most definitely be back to shop at the Mix Shops in the future.

I've been to Red Bar a few times now and really enjoy it. I find it to be a good spot if you are just with one other person or are out with a group. The outside patio is my favorite place to lounge with a drink. This past Saturday night when we were there with friends, the fireplace was on which gave a cozy vibe as we relaxed on the oversize beds with our drinks. I have never had a problem going to the inside bar and getting drinks...in fact, service has always been quick for me and the bartenders are really friendly. Rum and cokes cost about $9 and beers are $6. So if you are out for a night of drinking, you can expect to drop a pretty penny. If you arrive before 10 pm (I think), there is no cover. Red Bar isn't a place I could go every weekend, but every once in a while it's a nice destination.  My one negative about Red Bar is that the bathrooms are outside the lounge in the hotel. If you have to go to the bathroom, you need to get a hand stamp so you can get back in. Normally this is something I could probably overlook, but this past Saturday, we arrived before anyone was even checking IDs at the door, so we walked right in. I opened a tab at the bar and was required to leave my ID with my debit card. When I tried to leave to go to the bathroom and asked for a handstamp, I was told I had to show them my ID. I explained I arrived before they started IDing at the door and that my license was currently at the bar with my tab. They wouldn't give me a hand stamp!!!! So I was stuck not going to the bathroom the whole evening. It didn't ruin my evening but left a slightly bad taste in my mouth.  Despite that, I'll go back to Red Bar. You can't beat the upscale relaxed atmosphere and the people watching that abounds!

So I decided after living in Arizona for almost three months, it was probably time to go register my car and get a driver's license. I went the day after Thanksgiving at about 3 pm. I had to have an out-of-state inspection...this was quick and easy and I got to stay sitting in my car. Sweet!   I brought a book and was prepared to wait a long time once I got inside, but was pleasantly surprised when I was immediately given a number and it was called before I could even sit down. I was done with registering my car in about less than 10 minutes, which was awesome. Too bad it cost me a freaking arm and leg to register it...$286 for one year?? I vowed right there to never complain about Ohio's $55 annual fee ever again.  Unfortunately, the computers were down that day and I couldn't get my license.  I will say that all of the workers I encountered were very nice and helpful, which was nice because I work in state government myself, so I know it can make you bitter and jaded.  The two strikes against the Tempe MVD are:  *the guy who registered my car called me "Sweetie" numerous times. He was probably around 37, so it creeped me out.  *No Saturday hours. WTF? Thank goodness I bailed out of work early so I could take car of this little matter and still make it home in time to see the end of the LSU game.

I really really wanted to like Luminarias the Desert Botanical Gardens. I thought it was going to get me in the holiday spirit. Unfortunately, that didn't completely happen. What I imagined it was going to be like was definitely not what I encountered.    You couldn't see any of the plants because they weren't lit up.  The luminarias only gave off enough light so that you could make out the outline of trees and plants.  Also, only like four or five trees had lights on them and none of the cacti or other plants had lights on them. The only lights were the luminarias that lined the pathways. Boo.  Also, there was live music...I was expecting holiday music. You know, "Walking in a Winter Wonderland" and stuff like that. Oh no, that wasn't the case. Instead, there was "Just the Way You Look Tonight". We looked at each other and wondered if we were at a wedding.  Overall, it was definitely not worth the $25 admission fee for the Luminarias event. There was really nothing special about the event that made it seem worth that price. Plus, if you wanted any drinks (beer, wine, cider, etc), you had to pay for it at normal bar-type prices. For $25, I would have expected free hot chocolate and cookies at the bare minimum.

We have taken our dog, Sophie, a few times now to the dog park at the Tempe Sports Complex. It is absolutely fabulous once you find it! The Complex is huge, so the first time we went, we parked on the opposite side where the dog park is located since we didn't know better. My only problem is that there are no signs directing you at the Complex where everything is.  Since then we have figured out exactly where the dog park is and the best place to park (hint: turn onto Carver Rd and you can park in the lot right in front of the dog park. The Tempe Police substation is on the corner).  The dog park itself is absolutely huge-much, much bigger than the one we used to go to in Ohio. The times we have been to the park, there have been about 15-20 dogs which is a good amount. There are benches for the owners to sit on, as well as some picnic tables. Additionally, there are bags for dog poop and faucets for water, so if you forget bottled water it's no problem.  All of the dogs and owners we have met at the park are very friendly and nice.  We have not yet encountered an aggressive dog, and all of the owners watch their dogs very well.  Sophie has so much fun running around and playing and is always worn out by the time we get in the car to come home. She even found the last remaining puddle from the rain last week and managed to get muddy :)

We stopped in Munchies on Saturday night after a few hours of bar hopping on Mill Avenue. It was nearly 7 pm and we had been drinking for a few hours by that point, so food was critical. Some in the group went next door to Slices and the other members of our party went to Munchies. The menu is mainly Greek, but after four hours of drinking, I opted for a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries. The fries were salty and delicious...I'm a huge french fry fan (it's my main unhealthy food guilty pleasure) and I would love these fries sober or intoxicated. The grilled cheese was on pita bread which was interesting, but seriously can you really mess up grilled cheese?   I presume the gentleman working that evening was the owner and he was awesome. Not only did he not care that the other members of our group brought in their pizza from Slices, but when we were leaving he insisted that we leave our trash on the table and told us he would take care of it. He was very nice to our group and seemed like a very genuine owner that cares about customer service. Plus I presume he is use to dealing with drunk people!  Munchies is probably a 3 normally, but I'm giving it four stars because the owner was so nice, the food served it's purpose, and it's a good option after hitting up the Mill Avenue bars. I foresee future trips to Munchies in my future.

What a find in a strip mall! The inside is warm and cozy, and I love the open air dining room and patio. Like Ashley A. and Kristin S. said, the live music, while good, was much too loud. Carrying on a conversation, while possible, was hampered due to the music.  Our server was very nice and let three of us who arrived before happy hour ended at 7 to put a last minute drink order in for us; attentive and patient while waiting on six women.  Plus, she was very nice to run 5 different credit cards to pay the bill.  The menu was diverse and included small plates, entrees, and pizza. Everyone at the table tried a pizza and the consensus was that they were all very good.  I tried the bruschetta pizza and it was delicious, and I'm not even a huge gourmet pizza fan. My husband ate my leftovers for dinner on Friday night, and he said it was delicious as well and it heated up nicely (you never know with leftovers how they will taste the next day!). I thought some of the prices of the small plates were a tad high, but not sure the size of them.    I'm taking one star off because I didn't find the happy hour price of my wine very much of a deal.  $7.50 for a glass of Riesling at happy hour? Maybe I'm spoiled by Caffe Boa's happy hour, but I don't find $7.50 much of a happy hour deal (the glass normally was $9.50). Maybe $2 off during happy hour is a deal at a place like Javino's, but I've seen better happy hour specials other places.

(I have not ate at this Saddle Ranch. This review is for SR on weekend nights after 10 pm).  You will like Saddle Ranch in Old Town Scottsdale if you are:  A creepy middle aged guy A creepy douchebag OR An attention seeking skank of a female who likes to ride mechanical bulls in super short dresses  Seeing as how I am none of those, I dislike Saddle Ranch as a bar/late night destination. Plus the bar service sucks and you can get cheaper beer at other places.

We don't have H&M in Phoenix, so I have to get my fix when I travel somewhere where there is a store. I decided to make a quick trip down to the H&M store at the Miracle Mile shops since I was staying in the Planet Hollywood hotel. Thank goodness I didn't have to go far because it was a really unimpressive store.  To start, it's not that big. Second, the selection is incredibly lacking. Except for what I bought, most everything was not cute. Third, where were the summer dresses??? All I saw were shirts, shirts, and more shirts. I saw one...yes one...summer dress in the whole store and it was hideous. Fourth, what store doesn't take American Express??? When the cashier told me they didn't accept AmEx, I was stunned. I mean, I know AmEx has high fees, but I think it's the first store in three years that I have been in that doesn't take it. Fifth, the layout sucks.   I appreciate that it was a clean store (I had visions that it would resemble Old Navy...picked over and messy), but the merchandise selection was disappointing. It's a 1.5 star H&M, but I'm rounding up to two since I walked away with three cute shirts. If you need your H&M fix while in Vegas, go to the one down the street.

A small group of co-workers and I recently tried Thai Elephant for lunch one day. Wow, what a great find.  We're always looking for places that offer decent to good food at a reasonable price where we can get in and out quickly if need be.  Thai Elephant fit all three of those criteria.  Lunch cost about $10 each (that includes tip), so not bad at all, considering the portions were a good size.  When you order, the waitress asks how spicy you want your food...another check for Thai Elephant! I admit I am not a huge fan of super spicy food, so I asked for them to go pretty mild on the spices, and it came out perfectly for me. I ordered the Siamese Basil with chicken and it was delicious. The chicken was cooked very nicely and was still moist, which I prefer (I am not a fan of dry chicken at all). The vegetables and rice sides were good as well...I left perfectly content but not super full.  Thai Elephant is really small inside and the tables are practically on top of each other, so if you are claustrophobic or don't want people to potentially overhear your conversation, this isn't the place for you.  Service is fast and we were in and out in about 40 minutes.  Parking is available on the street, although sometimes finding a spot can be a challenge.  Great option for those of us that work downtown and are looking for a new, quick lunch joint.

I love the Tempe Orbit. The best part is that it is free! Since moving here six months ago, we have taken the Orbit numerous times as it runs right past our condo complex to Mill Avenue.  It runs about every 15 minutes, give or take a few minutes...I think we waited once for 20 minutes but it wasn't a big deal.  Even if you aren't standing at one of the bus stops, you can flag the bus down if you are walking and it will pick you up.  Of course since it is public transportation, it offers awesome (and I do mean awesome) opportunities for people watching.  In fact, we have even started to notice some "regulars" who are quite the characters.  Minus one star for not running past 10 pm.

My husband and I went to The Estate House on Saturday evening to celebrate his graduation from ASU. I had been to the Upstairs lounge twice previously with friends, but had never ate there. We thought a graduation celebration was a good excuse to try the food.  Our reservation was at 7:30 pm, and when we arrived, perhaps half the restaurant was full. The space is cozy and warm feeling. The wine list is long and varied - it was nice to see they offered so many wine by the glass choices as sometimes I feel like this is lacking at a lot of restaurants. However, my husband and I decided to share a bottle of sauvignon blanc (it's their only bottle from New Zealand - the exact name escapes me) which was delicious and a great compliment to our meals.  The amuse bouche (halibut ceviche on a dried pear slice) was very enjoyable and light. The complimentary bread was so soft with a crisp edge which is exactly how I like my bread. We skipped salads and appetizers, but I'm kicking myself now for not getting the heirloom tomatoes with burrata because the table next to us got that and it looked fresh, delicious and beautiful. For dinner, I had the fettucine with herb crema, mushrooms, and truffle oil - the portion size was perfect and the pasta was cooked perfectly. My husband had the halibut entree and he let me sneak a bite - the fish was very well cooked which was good because we've had some rather disappointing fish dishes other places in the Valley. We also got a side of the grilled garlic potatoes, which are basically oversized steak fries. I never got the garlic taste, so I feel like calling them grilled garlic potatoes was a bit of a misnomer. However, they were good, although if you are sharing this side, I would recommend getting two because you only get four potatoes with a side. Since when I made our reservation, I said we would be celebrating Chris' graduation, we received a complimentary bread pudding dessert - we devoured it within minutes so I think that speaks to how amazing it was. After tax and tip our bill was $122 which we thought was very reasonable given what we ordered and the solidness of all the dishes we ordered.  After dinner, we went up to the Upstairs lounge for a post-dinner drink. (Note: If you dine downstairs, they will take your drinks upstairs for you after you are done with your meal if you want them to.) From my three visits now to the Upstairs lounge, I would really recommend sitting outside. While the inside is cozy, I think the outdoor patio is the real highlight of the space. The live band I have seen twice on Saturday nights there is really good and entertaining. I have tried the rose mojito which while a touch on the gimmicky side is actually really good.  The Estate House was a great choice for our date night. The Upstairs lounge is a nice place to have drinks at the beginning of the evening before going out to other places in Scottsdale or as a destination if you just want a relaxing evening with a few people. I enjoy having this more sophisticated option in Old Town.

I don't get this place. Exposed brick, exposed HVAC pipes, servers in concert t-shirts, and stripper poles make me one confused girl on what the heck Digestif is going for and I am sure it wasn't because I had a few glasses of wine at Kaz beforehand.  Plus I understand it's a restaurant, but places with a single stall bathroom for each sex irk me.  The food I tried was all completely underwhelming. I had the Sicilian caesar salad which was basically just watery lettuce. Although it looked like there was dressing on it, I couldn't taste any. Plus a good amount of the lettuce was brown. Needless to say I didn't eat the whole thing.  The chevre I ordered was delicious as it is really hard to screw up cheese, but I wish they gave you more than two little pieces of bread.  I tried Ashley A's pasta which was extremely salty, and I also tried Kristin S.'s scallops which were incrediby overcooked.  I shouldn't have to chew for like two minutes to eat scallops...they should just melt in your mouth.  My sauvignon blanc was just OK, nothing spectacular or worth raving over.  Service was very spotty and by the time we were done eating, I was completely over Digestif. When the server asked about dessert, I practically screamed (just so he could hear me because it was very very loud in the restaurant), "No we'll just take the check!".  For the 8 of us, our bill was around $240 which did not include gratituity, which confused us. Most restaurants will automatically add tip for a group of our size but our server did not. The only bright spot in the evening was when Ashley A and I decided to take a picture with the stripper pole at the end of the night before we left!

I went to Digestif Saturday night with two friends for the Yelp Eats menu...I was a bit skeptical about going after my previous Digestif visit last year, but figured since they were in a new space, why not give them a second chance. I am very glad I did.  I love the new space so much more than where they were located previously. It's small and intimate, and if you have a chance to sit at the counter like we did, you get to watch all the cooking happen and interact with the chefs. The only hiccup in our two hour dining experience was service - I understand there is only one waitress (who was quite friendly) handling all the tables and everyone at the counter, but it took us quite a while to place our order and then receive refills on our drinks.   Thankfully the food more than made up for any delay in service we experienced. All three of us had the watermelon and crab salad which was sooo fresh and tasty. Then all three of us had the burrata and peppers (it was supposed to be mozzarella, but they had just gotten burrata that day so it was a last minute change) which was excellent, although I could have done with about half the amount of peppers. My friend Brad and I had the scallops which were cooked perfectly and were seasoned well. My other friend has the confit fried chicken which she loved...I tried the blue cheese slaw that came with the chicken and it was awesome.  Overall, a marked improvement from my previous Digestif experience. Located conveniently between Cowboy Ciao and Kaz, it's a nice option if you are in Old Town.

On Friday, some co-workers wanted pizza for lunch, but we knew we needed to go somewhere quick. We ventured to Carmine's Little Italy...I wish we hadn't. While service was quick and we had our food within minutes of ordering, the pizza was bad. I'm not sure if they are trying to go for NY pizza, but if they are, they have missed the mark. My slice of cheese was barely hot and the cheese was starting to congeal. I prefer my pizza slices to be a little bit greasy and this slice lacked grease entirely. Thankfully, I had also ordered a caesar side salad, which was a nice size and very tasty.   For a fountain soda, slice pizza, and side salad, the total was $7.25. There is plenty of seating inside and out, and for as unappealing as the pizza was, there was quite a line when we left. This is definitely a disappointing lunch destination in downtown Phoenix.

As a happy hour destination, La Bocca is a very good option on Mill. Wine by the glass, draft beer and well liquor (listed in the drink menu) is all half off, as are Bud Light and Coors Light bottles. The bar is nice and service is friendly and attentive. As a dinner option, however, I think you can do better. I am not super impressed with the food I have tried at La Bocca...the caesar salad was just OK and I've had better caprese sandwiches other places (note: the caprese sandwich is no longer on the menu...there is a caprese salad though).   Three stars as a dinner option and four stars as a happy hour destination, giving La Bocca 3. 5 stars. However, I'll round up to four because I value places with good happy hour specials; plus La Bocca is a nice addition to Mill Avenue and a good place to escape when you want a more grown up night out on Mill.

Nothing beats sitting by pool and drinking after a long night of drinking at the club. The MGM pools did not disappoint my group this past weekend. Even though we didn't get down to the pool until close to 1 pm, we were still able to snag two chairs together in one spot and three together a few feet away.  Drink service was a bit slow and the cocktail waitresses were not overly friendly. However, $25 for a bucket of beer made up for it with my group. Despite how many people were out at the pool area, none of the pools or lazy river were ever that crowded which was nice.   If you don't want to search for chairs, go early in the morning (Sunday morning around 10:45 am wasn't very crowded at all) or later in the afternoon because chairs started freeing up more and more the closer it got to 5 pm. My group spent both days at the Academy pool which is close to the entrance and near the Cabana Grill.  My only frustrating experience with the MGM pool was trying to rent a cabana. When I called the week before (per instructions), I was told I could only be put on a list. When I checked again Saturday (I was trying to get a cabana for Sunday), I was told that again they couldn't rent me one then but that I would get a phone call to let me know if I would get it. It was very frustrating especially since I didn't get a cabana in the end. I wish they would make the policy and reservation process more clear.  The number of pools (including a lazy river) and the layout of the pool area impressed me. MGM definitely has one of the better pool areas in Vegas.

When we were in Vegas in November, we decided to dine at Sushi Samba one night since we were staying at the Palazzo. The restaurant is tucked away in the corner and has a dark sexy vibe to it. We had 6:30 pm reservations on a Friday night and since it was a little early, the restaurant was not overly busy which allowed us to receive a lot of attention from Mike, our waiter. He was one of the best waiters I have had in a restaurant in a long time...he was very helpful in helping us select a bottle of sake and made recommendations on the food and how many plates to order for our group of 5. Plus he checked on us often enough so we didn't sit with empty glasses, but not too much where it was annoying.  The food was amazing for the most part. The scallops and chicken robota were my two favorite things that we ordered that evening. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were not gritty at all. They didn't quite have that melt in my mouth feeling, but were some of the best I have had since moving to the Southwest. My husband sampled some of the sushi that our group ordered, and even as a sushi newcomer, he was not blown away by it. It was probably the most disappointing of the dishes that our group ordered. Our group received three complimentary desserts (we were celebrating 3 birthdays that evening) of which the chocolate hazelnut dish was my favorite. It was absolutely heavenly.  Our group's bill came to approximately $200, which I thought was reasonable given the number of dishes we ordered, plus we also had a bottle of sake ($62 itself), and several other alcoholic beverages. Sushi Samba is definitely a great restaurant for those dining in a group because the circular booths are large and perfectly designed for chatting with the person next to you or across the table. I will definitely dine again at Sushi Samba on a future trip to Vegas.

Three girlfriends and I decided to go to PHX Friday night because we were in the mood for dancing and hip hop. It was so much fun and I'm already thinking about when I will be able to go back next! It's in a good location located on the same block as Silver and Bar Smith, and Hanny's is around the corner.  First, when you walk up, there is a red carpet. Then before you walk in you have to be patted down (if you are a guy) and have your purse searched even if it's itty bitty and only has room enough for ID, money, and cell phone (if you are a girl). So before you get it, you know this has the makings of an interesting night! WARNING: Cover is $10 which is really my only big negative for PHX.  The space is actually pretty small when you get inside - there is a large bar to the left, a large seating area right when you walk in, and then a few booths to your right that are raised from the dance floor. The dance floor itself is a pretty good size, although it does get crowded as the night goes on. Dress was definitely fashionable club wear, so any place that gives me an excuse to wear a party dress is cool with me!  Service at the bar was always really quick, and it didn't hurt there were some hottie bartenders! Beer was $3 which was awesome. Music alternated between r&b and hip hop, and I would say 98% of the time, it was great. There were a few times when the DJ played way too slow r&b music which me and my friends were not feeling. But then the next song would be a great hip hop song, so I can't hate too much on the music. As in any other club in America, PHX does provide some amazing people watching.  If you don't mind getting searched to get into a club (I will say it was a first for me) and a commanding police presence when you leave, and want good hip hop to dance to, PHX is definitely a place to check out.

Bar North left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I don't think it was entirely due to the chlorine flavored water or lemon infused cannoli.  For a bar in North Scottsdale, I was expecting more.  When you walk in, Bar North has a good sophisticated feel to it and I really liked the open air feel.    We initially started out sitting at the bar while we hawked a table outside to open up. Personally I think the drink choices are incredibly lacking for a place with the word "Bar" in its name. There were only 5 or 6 beer choices and the wine list was pretty meager as well.  A person next to us asked if they had Red Bull and they didn't...again as a "bar" even an upscale one at that, I was a bit surprised they didn't have Red Bull.   The two desserts that our group tried during the evening weren't very good at all...the cannolis were disgusting, but thankfully were only $4. The hazelnut cake did not get good reviews either from those in our group that tried it.  I could have gotten over a lackluster drink selection and disappointing desserts if the service had been awesome.  However, service, to be frank, sucks.  The girl behind the bar was awful (not friendly at all...it seemed like we were inconveniencing her) and when I tried to close our tab because we were moving outside, it took forever to finally get someone's attention.  Once we moved outside and had a waiter, it didn't get better.  He clearly walked by a few times and never asked how we were doing and if we wanted/needed more drinks. Once we got the bill, he never came and picked it up, so Kristin S. had to take it inside to the bar to pay.  To top the whole night off, the outside of Bar North faces the fountains. So we were treated to children screaming and running through the fountains at 10 pm. Later we saw one child sitting at a table in Bar North eating dessert...at like 10:30 pm. Awesome.

I'd been meaning to check in Pitaya for awhile especially since everytime I'm on Mill, I see it and remind myself that I need to go there. Last night on my way home from work, I decided to stop and see what it was all about.   My quick summary is that it's pretty much Mill's version of H&M only organized and neatly arranged. Everything is seperated by color which I actually like. The prices are very much on par with H&M and some of the clothes have that H&M quality feel to them. So basically don't be surprised when the $12 shirt you bought falls apart in the washing machine after a few washes. But really, when you walk away with a cute shirt for a fraction of what you would have paid at a department store, you have to be happy! The salesgirls are friendly and willing to help, but also give you space to just peruse the merchandise and make your choices.  My only two negatives about Pitaya are: 1) They have a "no bags" policy for the dressing rooms which includes purses. I felt really funny giving the salesgirl my purse to hold while I tried on a shirt. But I guess they are on Mill and people might want to shoplift...and 2) They don't carry extra smalls!!! In anything!!! Seriously? No extra smalls? They are lucky the shirt I tried on works on me as a small, but I would have appreciated an extra small to give it a more snug fit.  I feel like Pitaya is one of those hit or miss stores...sometimes you walk in and come out a winner (like I did last night) and sometimes you don't find anything. But since it's close, I know I'll be stopping in again to try my luck.

While my husband was at his conference, I was left to my own devices and decided to indulge in some retail therapy one morning. I stopped in the Jimmy Choo store inside Palazzo to get a pair or two of new shoes.   On a Tuesday morning around 10:45 am, the store was not too busy so I had the sales associate Jessica to myself. Unfortunately the store did not have the burgundy Dane peep toe booties (these are a pair of the shoes Nicole Kidman wears in one of the ads...I have been wanting them since getting the Jimmy Choo catalogue in the mail two months ago) in my size. Jessica offered to order them for me, but I am highly hesitant to spend money, especially $$$$, on shoes without trying them on.  I left disappointed and went over to Christian Louboutin to try and cheer up. I was in the store for about 10 minutes and, somehow and I am still not sure how, Jessica from Jimmy Choo shows up and tells me that she was doing some looking around and that the store at Caesar's has the Danes in my size! She called and had them put on hold for me!   Personally I really appreciated this level of customer service which she did not have to do. I will definitely be going back to this Jimmy Choo store on a future trip to Vegas.

I dig Maizie's. It's cozy without being cramped; the patio is great to sit on after a long day at work; the couches are really comfy so beware if you go for lunch because you will not want to get up; and there are a few TVs scattered throughout the inside so if you are by yourself you have something to do besides "look busy" on your Blackberry.  Happy hour runs until 6 and includes $5 appetizers, $3 beer and mixed drinks, and $2 off glasses of wine. I wish the happy hour ran later because getting somewhere by 6 can be challenging after work. The basil bruschetta was delicious and the spinach dip was also really good. I love the groovy grilled cheese because it leaves me full without being stuffed. The french fries are really good, although I did notice a few were a bit too well done today when I was there for lunch. However, I did not care for the potato pancakes at all...to me they were just mashed potatoes that were every so slightly deep fried. I guess I just have a different perception of what a potato pancake is.  Maizie's is a cute neighborhood spot located conveniently on the light rail line. There is limited parking out front, but I have found that a few doors down you can park quite easily in another lot. I can't wait to go back and try brunch because I hear they have $3 mimosas!

Maizie's, I will miss you. I had my last meal today there since I will be moving from the Valley next week. Of course I had to get my two favorite items on the menu one last time: basil pesto bruschetta and the groovy grilled cheese. The bread for the bruschetta is always perfectly toasted and the groovy grilled cheese found the perfect blend of brie, apple and bacon.  I only got to go to Maizie's once for brunch, but it was delicious. I really enjoyed my omelet with feta, cheddar and black olives. It's actually making my mouth water now thinking about it. I guess I better learn to cook so I can make it for myself. Mimosas are $3 and I have heard that they even have pitchers of mimosa during brunch!  This is a great neighborhood spot and I am going to miss it!

I have a confession to make before I go any further with this review: My husband and I occasionally visit chain restaurants when we really don't want to put much effort into going out to eat.  OK now that is out of my system, I can continue. We've been to Buca before (visited the location in Columbus probably about 8-10 times with friends for group dinners) so we know the concept and that it's about sharing and all that jazz. We ended up at this location on Sunday night when we were trying to find *gasp* TGI Fridays. Well let me save you a drive to this part of town and tell you that Fridays is no longer there. Anyway, we saw Buca and decided to suck it up and eat there. We had about a five minute wait and then were led back through the kitchen (as you are at any Buca) to our table. We had some confusion with our service because at one point we were told our waitress got a big party and wouldn't be handling our table anymore, and then she did for the rest of our night. Weird.  Unfortunately the food was not as good as we remembered. The cheese garlic bread was cut into squares and wasn't served in a pie shaped. The caesar salad was under-dressed, but as a plus it held up nicely as a leftover for me to have the next night for dinner. Chris thought the chicken parm was not as good as it used to be (we think they changed the recipe or something). My side of fettucini alfredo was good thankfully and heated up nicely on Tuesday night as my dinner. All and all, the food was a major disappointment even for chain restaurant standards!  The bright spot was that for $69 (includes tip) we got four meals out of the food we ordered. Buca was a 2.5 star experience for us, but I'm rounding down to 2 due to not living up to our standards.

After seeing a movie late Saturday afternoon, the husband and I decided to try D'Arcy McGees since we were in the area. Big mistake. It's the Disney World version of an Irish pub. The hostesses and waitresses are dressed in short plaid skirts and knee highs. The menus are super glossy and remind me of the ones you get at Ruby Tuesdays. Not much on the menu appealed to us, which made selecting something to eat hard. There isn't much on the menu that screams Irish pub to me at all except for boxtys.  We had the "Blarney Chips" as an appetizer which were waffle fries, cheese, tomatoes and jalapeno peppers. They were not good at all. The "nippy cheese" was Cheez-Whiz! It also made the fries soggy. We left quite a bit on the plate. For dinner, Chris had the Yorkshire pudding appetizer, which he said was reasonably good. I had the Warm Goat Cheese salad...mistake. The goat cheese was mixed with herbs and something else that Chris and I can't put our fingers on, but whatever it was, it did not taste good. The spring mix was good, but if you mess up lettuce, then you should not be in business. For 2 beers, 2 appetizers, and 1 salad, our bill came to $42. Prices were definitely on the high side for the quality of food.  D'Arcy McGees has no atmosphere at all and could really be helped by having live bands. It really is a restaurant and has no pub feel to it at all. As Chris said, this wouldn't be a place you would just go and drink like you would at other pubs in the Valley like Rosie's or Rula Bula. To sum up our experience at D'Arcy McGees, when we were waiting to pay the bill, Chris looked at me and said, "I wish we had just gone to Chipotle instead."

On Saturday night after some drinking at the Wynn, our group decided to head over to the Mirage for some dancing at Jet. Now this was my very first time going to a Vegas club without having a table or being on the guestlist, so I was a bit nervous about the whole wait in line business. However, thankfully we were good and toasty at that point, the group I was with is hilarious, and we met some awesome people in line. Not sure exactly how long we waited in line, but I would estimate 30 minutes at least. When we got in, the ladies got in free and the guys paid $30 cover each. So typically Vegas.  The inside has a main room with a dance floor and tables for bottle service, as well as a stage with poles for those girls feeling frisky. There are some other rooms off the main room, which I enjoyed more when we made our way to one of them. Much less crowded and easier to get drinks. In the main room, our group was able to find an area off to the side that had a small bar in the wall where we could put drinks down and dance. The music was awesome...lots of hip hop with some classic rock thrown in. My husband and I had a great time dancing on the main dance floor even if we did get bumped into a few times.  I definitely wouldn't get a table at Jet in the main room...they were practically on the dance floor. I prefer getting tables at clubs that are set a bit away from the main area so you can have privacy if you want it or a retreat from the craziness of the dance floor. However, I would definitely go back to Jet in the future because the ambiance was cool, the music was good, and the people watching was awesome.

Within seconds of arriving at the Mirage for a weekend stay, a host at JET came up to my two girlfriends and I asking if we wanted to be on the "VIP Guest List" as the promotion they were running that night was free drinks for ladies until midnight. Free drinks always sounds good so we were down, plus I had fun at JET on a previous trip to Vegas, so why not? The host we worked with, Ronald, was really nice and texted me numerous times before we arrived at the club with all the instructions we needed. We were escorted into the club when it opened and took advantage of the free drinks (they gave drink tickets). The only negative about this experience was that we were never told the free drinks were only good for Skyy vodka. Oh well, cranberry and vodka was fine with my group of three.   During the night, waitresses walked around with free pineapple upside down shots...you could tell they were free because they were gross. The main dance floor got super crowded as the night went, so we escaped to the back room. In both rooms, the music was awesome. We did meet some British guys who paid for some of our drinks, although at one point each of us bought a Bud Light which was $9.

I was in Vegas this past weekend for a joint bachelorette party and I arranged bottle service at JET for Saturday night through Dave, one of the hosts. He was super easy to work with and responded within seconds it seemed like to any email I sent. He even hooked my group of 8 ladies up with buy one bottle, get one free. Sweet! When we arrived at the club at 11 pm, we only had to wait for about two minutes in the table line before we were escorted back to our table.  Our table (table 60) was in the back room which is my favorite room in JET so I was pumped. Plus we our table was in the corner near the DJ and we really felt like we had the intimate space we were paying for. The ledge above the table to dance on was definitely utilized by my group. Our waitress was super sweet and super hot and definitely put up with our group's drunkenness with grace!  Any night where you lose a phone and one of your friends gets kicked out for throwing up in the bathroom is one crazy night! However, in both cases, the security guys were very nice (they looked for my phone and let my friend come back to the table to get her purse before they escorted her out). Thanks JET for another fun experience!

Serenity Skin Spa opened a few weeks ago by Jeanette Rebeske inside the Valencia Salon Studios on Shea Boulevard between Scottsdale Road and 74th Street. Jeanette previously was at Par Exsalonce which is how I met her...she was the esthetian I saw at Par and when she told me she was leaving to open her own small studio, I followed her. I mean, let's face it ladies, it's hard to find a good waxer!  Jeanette's one room studio is peaceful, relaxing, and incredibly well put together. She is such a warm person who makes you feel at ease as soon as you meet her and we end up chatting the whole time I am getting waxed. I can't say enough good things about how good she is at her job and I wouldn't trust my eyebrows or other delicate areas to anyone else around here.  Jeanette also does facials, peels and brow/lash tinting in addition to waxing. Prices depend on the service (for waxing, area of the body), but looking at the brochure I picked up last week, they are incredibly reasonable ($15 for brow waxing; $70 for a 50 min facial; etc). If you are looking for a good esthetian, I highly recommend Jeanette.

On Friday night, we checked out the LAVO lounge and then later in the night made our way up to the nightclub. Upon arriving around 12:30ish at the lounge, all the tables that would accomodate our group of four were taken so we snagged two chairs and a small side table which we made work. The bar was crowded, but being a girl and a bit assertive, I got service at the bar very quickly. I am always impressed at bars that are busy when the bartender remembers my name and what I am drinking, which is what occured on Friday night at LAVO's lounge. You can hear the music from the nightclub upstairs which is really nice - plus the music all night was exactly what you want to hear.  After our friends headed back to our hotel, my husband and I decided on a whim to check out LAVO's nightclub. We had already started to walk elsewhere in the Palazzo, but turned the corner and went to the nightclub entrance. At 1:45ish at night, there was no line and no cover for my husband. When you enter the nightclub you walk up the stairs and down a hallway lined with marble (or maybe they were ceramic - I didn't inspect them closely) fountains on either side. The dance floor is to the right once you are in the main part of the club. The dance floor is moderate size, and despite arriving at 1:45 at night, we were able to find a good area to dance in. The dance floor had a lot of people on it, but it wasn't shoulder to shoulder making it impossible to dance. We didn't get any drinks, but danced for about an hour to the good mix of hip-hop and rap the DJ had going.  I enjoyed the lounge at LAVO more than the nightclub - you got the music from the club without the crowd and you had the ability to carry on a conversation with the people you were with. Plus the lounge didn't have any creepy guys which clubs always seem to attract! I will definitely go back to LAVO on a future trip to Vegas.

My sister and I ate dinner at LAVO on Saturday night. We had 7:15 pm reservations and even though it was a tad early to eat by Vegas standards, the restaurant was pretty full. The tables for two are a little close together, but you still feel as if you have your own space and I really didn't overhear either of our neighbor's conversations.  Our meal started with two glasses of sauvignon blanc and complimentary garlic bread. The garlic bread portion was huge and a great side for our meals. For entrees, my sister had the chicken parmigiano, I had the chilean sea bass, and we split a sea salt baked potato. Our waitress graciously mentioned to my sister that her meal did not include pasta in case she wanted to add that (she didn't). Once we saw the size of the chicken parm, I can see why it doesn't come with pasta! Her piece of chicken was the size of her plate! Needless to say she wasn't able to eat the whole thing, but she loved every bite that she did have. My sea bass, which was a nice thick slice, was cooked to perfection - it was flaky and just melted in my mouth. The baked potato was a great size (thank goodness we shared it), but could have used just a touch more salt. For dessert, we shared the chocolate cake roll. In keeping with the theme of our meal, it was gigantic. Easily four people could have shared that dessert. The cake was delicious and light which was good since we were pretty full from our entrees.  Our waitress was very nice and did a great job of checking on us through the night. She also didn't rush us as we took our time with dessert and finishing our wine. The food does come out rather quickly - it couldn't have been more than ten minutes from the time we ordered until the time food appeared at our table. LAVO does a great job with table turnover, so even if you walk in without a reservation, you probably won't have to wait too long. Prices are actually really reasonable - after tax and tip, my share of the bill was $82.  I would definitely eat at LAVO on a future visit and will be recommending it to friends who are traveling to Vegas in the near future.

4 stars for the nightclub.  In March 2013, I traveled to Vegas with my sister and one of her friends for a girls weekend in Vegas. They had never done table service at a nightclub before, so I decided to be generous and spring for a table on the Saturday night we would be there. I decided on LAVO because the host, Matthew Goodman, was incredibly responsive. Literally within 10 minutes of sending my inquiry email, I had texts from Matt to help set up my reservation (this was opposed to some other clubs that either never responded or took days to respond). He also offered to get us into the brunch, but we decided against it as we wanted to do other things during the day.   The entrance to the nightclub is on the side and not a far walk from the door that the taxis drop you off at. There was no wait to check in (we arrived around 11 pm) and Matt walked us to our table. Throughout the night he checked on us a few times which I thought was great customer service. Our cocktail server at the table was totally on point, and we were never without drinks. I managed to get us a free bottle of champagne which we had first before moving on to the Ketel One vodka bottle I bought.  The negative about table service at LAVO is that while we had a table right off the dance floor (I cannot complain about the location) is that we were squished in between two other tables with groups. When you get a table, you are expecting to get space to spread out and relax. We were kind of on top of each other which is the reason I give the nightclub 4 stars. But if you want a table, I highly recommend getting ahold of Matt. He is the best host I have worked with in Vegas.

I appreciate grocery stores that are small because I get overwhelmed in the big box grocery stores (Frys and Safeway I'm looking at you). I decided to venture to Fresh and Easy because a co-worker told me that she really liked their pesto and since I am a pesto nut, I thought I would give it a whirl.   F&E is set up like a multitude of other grocery stores...produce on the right immediately when you walk in and frozen items all the way to the right with everything else in between. I had heard about the produce pre-packaging so I was prepared for it. I absolutely hate it. Maybe I'm odd but I like to touch the produce and pick out what I want. Now granted the fact that two green peppers were in the pre-packaging doesn't offend me because I always buy two peppers at a time. But it took me forever to find a package that had 2 good peppers in it. The selection of wraps/sandwiches/salads is smaller and not as varied as Trader Joe's. The chicken caesar wrap I bought was not very good at all...first the dressing came on the wrap and not in a container on the side; second, it barely had any dressing on it; and third, it had almost 400 calories in it! I nearly fell over when I saw that. There are only two items that I bought that I see myself returning to Fresh and Easy for in the future: pesto (much better and less oily than the TJ's version) and chocolate pudding cups (49 cents and a tasty, yet slightly indulgent, lunch snack).   I imagine F&E has to have very low overhead costs due to the paltry amount of staff working and the fact that every checkout lane is self service. Also there is not a lot of choice among items or very many of any one item on the shelves. I found it odd that there would be Ragu red sauce, but no Ragu alfredo sauce; then there would be Classico alfredo sauce, but no Classico red sauce. It was little things like that I noticed that turned me off. There is no way I could do all of my shopping at F&E that is for sure. Thank goodness my husband does 99% of our grocery shopping!

What a horrible sportsbook! Sure there are plenty of places to sit with a mixture of couches, bar stools, and ottomons, but that is about the only good thing I can say. First, the main area of couches on the tiered steps faces a very large TV screen that shows...one game! One freaking game! No other TVs around the main screen, nothing. So let me get this straight, I can sit in super comfy seats but I can only watch one game? Wow, the sports bars I go to in Phoenix, Arizona, are way better than that...at least those bars have a lot of TVs showing multiple games. I mean, this is the worst sportsbook for a person with sports ADD.  Also finding a TV with the game you actually want to watch...impossible. The Rams had a better chance of beating the Jets last Sunday than I did actually finding a TV carrying that game! Finally I found one TV at the bar carrying that game. The only good thing about snagging this particular seat was that I could watch 3 games. Thank goodness. I left at halftime because the bar seat was incredibly uncomfortable and the food looked hideous. If you're a sports fan, don't waste your time at this sportsbook. There are better ones to be found.

My husband and I ventured up to BLT Steak at Camelback Inn on Friday evening to celebrate our third wedding anniversary, which was two days earlier. We sat inside and our corner table gave us a perfect view of Camelback Mountain at night.   Our waiter was super nice and did a great job of suggesting items and answering questions when we had them. There was a seperate server who kept our water glasses full all night - we couldn't take more than two sips without having them refilled it seemed like. My only negative about our waiter was that when it was time for a new glass of wine for me, he didn't check with me first to see if I wanted another glass of the same wine. I think we all know the common saying about assuming things...  On to the food...here's what we sampled:  Popovers - delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the butter and sea salt, especially since I don't like butter very much, but it was great!   Caesar salad - good size and it was one of the best caesar salads I have had in awhile.   Crabcake - my least favorite part of the meal. While it wasn't horrible, there was a bit too much celery for my taste and not enough crab meat.  Cowboy Ribeye - since it was 22 oz, I graciously told my husband that I would have some of it so he could order it. Now those that know me know that I don't eat red meat because I don't like the taste. But I sucked it up and had some...holy crap, I had a few bites and said, "Wow, this is really good". So that should say something about how good it was. However, my husband did think the outside was a tad too well done, although the meat itself was cooked perfectly. While he liked the ribeye, he did think his steak at SW Steakhouse in Las Vegas was better.  Mashed potatoes - is it possible to get divorced over mashed potatoes? I thought we were going to throw it down because one side of the potatoes was just not enough!! They were sooo creamy and delicious.   Chocolate peanut butter mousse - we got our dessert for free since when I made the reservation I indicated we were celebrating our anniversary. The dessert was a nice way to end the meal, although the chocolate on top was just a touch too rich for my taste.  With tip, our bill came to $162 which we did not think was bad at all for as much as we ordered. Unfortunately we didn't get to sit on the patio or enjoy the view at sunset, but I guess that means we'll have to go back which isn't a bad thing at all!

I dig Hanny's. It's a great addition to the downtown Phoenix scene, both for during the day and at night. There is plenty of parking around Hanny's, albeit at meters, but if you go at night the meters turn off at 8 pm. The space is open, so you can definitely tell it was a department store in its previous life. The elevator shaft still freaks me out everytime I go and I am still confused a bit by the bathrooms, although I am not sure if it's because they are trendy or if because I usually have been drinking when I need to go upstairs for the bathroom.  I've had lunch twice now at Hanny's and have sampled both one of the sandwiches - the BLT Supremo (it is a BLT with hard boiled egg and cheese)- and a pizza - Bianco. While I loved my sandwich, I was very underwhelmed by the pizza. However, I am not a fan of thin crust pizza, so that is probably the reason why. The sandwich was a nice size and they cooked the bacon perfectly for me. The sandwich came with some onion straws, so that satisfied my fried food guilty pleasure.   Prices at Hanny's are, for the most part, really reasonable. The pizza, which is a nice size, was $11, and the sandwich was around $8 or so. I've only bought beer to drink, but my Stella Artois on Friday night was $5. Domestic beers looked to run around $3-4. I have found the service at the bar to be fast, but table service during lunch to be pretty slow and non-attentive. It's definitely a good spot to check out when you are downtown!

Tempe Butte, also known as "A" Mountain, is located next to Sun Devil Stadium and is accessible from either Rio Salado, Veterans Way or Mill Ave. While it doesn't take as long to walk/hike up as Camelback or Piestewa, it is nothing to scoff at. My husband and I quickly found out when we ventured over to "A" Mountain a few weekends ago how deceiving it was! The walk up is pretty steep and will give your legs a great workout. At the steepest point, there are handrails to hold onto if you need them. There are two areas along the way to/from the summit with benches where you can stop and rest or just sit to enjoy the view. Off to the left before you get to the top, there is an area where you can sit on rocks to reflect, eat a snack, or rest before heading back down. Along the way up and at the top, there are nice views of Tempe and downtown Phoenix, but not as spectacular as the ones you can find at the summits of Camelback or Piestewa.  "A" Mountain seems popular with walkers/runners who make a few trips up and down the trails to get an extra good workout in. It's also a good place to bring a dog for a walk (Sophie quite enjoyed herself when we took her) and there are doggy bags conveniently located at the trailheads. Parking is easy and there are a few light rail stations nearby.

Located on the fifth floor at the Phoencian resort, J&G Steakhouse is a dark, open, sophisticated space. If your schedule is flexible, I would recommend dining around sunset to get that extra ambiance. However, even at 8 pm (that is the time we had reservations), the twinkling lights in the distance gave an extra romantic feel.  My husband and I decided to have a date night on Friday night, and we chose J&G since it was Restaurant Week and we had been wanting to try it. As most other reviews have said, the service is incredibly lacking and is only 2 stars. Luckily the food is exceptional and pretty much makes you forget how poor the service is that you are receiving.   We both ordered the RW menu - I had the caesar salad, parmesan crusted chicken, and the chocolate cake with caramel ice cream. The caesar salad was very fresh and for an appetizer was quite large. The chicken was the highlight for me. You get two nice sized chicken breasts (I could only eat 3/4 of one because they were so large)...the chicken was so incredibly moist. Plus the parmesan crust on the chicken gave it an upscale fried chicken feel and had a hint of saltiness to it which I loved. The chocolate cake was sinful - once you broke into the cake, there was molten chocolate inside which was complimented perfectly by the ice cream. My husband loved all of his food (tomato soup, hanger steak with fries, apple tart) and even shared the french fries that came with his steak with me (the fries were salty and delicious). With our entrees, we also ordered a side of the mashed potatoes which were amazing. They were so smooth and had just the right amount of butter in them. I only wish the side had been bigger because we argued over who got the last scoop!  For a beer, two RW menus, and a side of mashed potatoes, our bill before tip came to $79 which we thought was great. For a nice, resort steakhouse, the prices on the regular J&G menu are incredibly reasonable and we are already planning another trip back to try more items on the menu!

I think the fact that... A) my boobs are real B) my style is very untrashy/un-stripperish C) I don't have nappy hair extensions D) my IQ is higher than my cup size  ...equates to why I did not care for American Junkie. My friend and I got there around 10:30 on Saturday night and the line was pretty long. Luckily because we were just two girls (the rest of our group was already inside), we got to go to special "girls only" line. Ooooo, how VIP. Luckily one of our friends inside didn't want to stay, so I got my friend and I each a mixed drink to wash down quickly. Mixed drinks are $7 which is typical of OTS.  All told, I was at American Junkie for about 20 minutes, but in those 20 minutes...wow, did I do some amazing people watching. The people watching is the only reason I could see to come to this place. I do have three suggestions as a result of said fantastic people watching:  1) Guys - put the hair gel down! Seriously most girls think spiked hair is...well...douchey.  2) Girls - if you have fake boobs, please don't concave your back to stick your fake boobs out more. We all know they are fake just by looking at them. Sticking them out and then looking at them all night does not make them appear more real.  3) Girls - if you are wearing short shorts or a barely there jean skirt, wear a more modest top. We don't need to see boobs and butt; just one is more than enough thanks.

I was a workout class virgin until I took the class at Karve on Tuesday evening. While it didn't make me a convert to studio classes, it was a very intense, challenging, and different kind of workout for me. The studio is located along the Waterfront and is right across from Canal. The entire staff I interacted with last night from the girl at the front desk to our instructor Kendra to the class helpers were all very nice and helpful. The website is really good and you can even schedule classes online which is a great feature.  The Karve class combines ballet barre work, yoga, pilates and free weights to work your entire body...last night I discovered muscles I didn't even know I had! Even though I work out 4-5 times a week (weights and cardio), I still had to take a few second break once or twice during the one hour class because of the intensity and the fact it was a completely new way of working out for me. Breaks are encouraged if you need them and I saw others in the class stop for a few seconds when it got to be too much for them. I really liked the  fact there are class helpers and was not insulted at all when they came over to me once or twice (ok maybe more like five or six times) to correct what I was doing. I am glad they fixed it so I would be working the muscle or area I should have been. I did learn last night that if your legs start shaking uncontrollably, that's a good thing!   I agree with Amber that I would have liked if the instructor had demonstrated all the moves because I am very much a visual learner. Overall, Karve was a great workout and I am definitely feeling it this morning! I plan to go back and take classes occasionally to mix my workout up.

Myself and two friends stayed at the Aria for three nights at the beginning of March for a girls weekend in Vegas. I picked the Aria because of its location and the fact that none of us had stayed there before. Overall, we had a nice stay.  Check-in and check-out were really easy; upon arrival on Friday night at 9:30 pm, there was no one in line, so I was able to be helped immediately. A few minutes later and I would have been in a 10 person deep line which is still not that bad by Vegas standards. Check-out can be done from the room, or by dropping keys off at the front desk. The guest room elevators are not a far walk from the front desk and not that hard to find - do make sure to have your room key ready to show to the security near the elevators.  Upon entering the room, be ready for the lights to come on, curtains to open, soft music to play, and for the TV to have your name on it. They are all nice little touches, especially at night when you see the Strip light up as the curtains open. Our room, 14006, was a little hike from the elevators, but by the end of the our stay, it didn't seem that bad. The beds in the room were super comfortable and we melted into them at the end of every night. The bathroom is a good size, complete with double sinks, shower with soaking tub, and a toilet behind a frosted door. The shower was huge which made little things like shaving my legs really easy since I had plenty of room to spread out.  During our stay at the Aria, we had dinner at Julian Serrano (see separate review), partied for a few hours at Haze (see separate review), had drinks at The Deuce Lounge, and of course gambled. The Jean Philippe Patisserie (located right outside the guest elevators) looked amazing, but I resisted temptation and didn't indulge in any sweets.  Be warned that the Aria is huge, so we definitely got turned around a few times. Also the taxi stand is not right outside the doors  near the front desk - you actually need to walk about 180 degrees on the sidewalk to the taxi stand. It was a tad confusing at first and, personally, not the best design. Also there is nothing that really just wowed me about the property while walking around like The Cosmopolitan does. I wasn't blown away by the Aria which is why it only gets 4 stars from me. If I couldn't stay at the Cosmopolitan on a future Vegas trip, Aria would be one of my next choices.

My co-worker and I were both in desperate need of a pedicure because we are going to Florida this weekend for another co-workers wedding and we decided we didn't want whack looking feet since we'll be on the beach. Since we are both busy girls, we decided a pedicure during lunch would work the best and my co-worker suggested Pretty Nails and Spa. I am totally glad she did!  The basic pedicure is going to run you $20. That is completely reasonable and pretty darn cheap. Second, they give you a menu so you can choose to add on services (salt scrub for $5, callus remover for $5, etc) or you can go with the Pedi Plus for $32 which includes soothing gel rub, salt scrub, and the callus remover. My co-worker and I both did the Pedi Plus and we left feeling completely refreshed and with the best feeling and looking feet.   The techs were really nice - not too chatty, but fast working and would engage in conversation if you wanted them to. The chairs were some of the most comfortable I have sat in at a salon, and there were plenty of stations so unless you go when they are completely slammed, you get right in. Color selection was really big and diverse. Oh, and as my co-worker pointed out when we left, the salon didn't have that overwhelming nail polish and nail polish remover smell...so no getting high on fumes while you are sitting there!  Just a warning: they only take tips in cash. You can use a credit card (Visa or Mastercard) to pay for your services though.

Normally I wouldn't review a place like McDonald's since we all know that the food is fried, greasy, and all around bad for you. However, this McDonald's warrants a review because it is a people watching mecca. If you work anywhere in the area, go once...you will thank me.  You know you are going to a klassy McDonald's establishment when the first thing you see is a sign on the door that says "No large bags and no bedrolls". My co-workers and I have seen such interesting people as a guy with a gun in his waistband eating with his family; a woman in a bikini top talking to herself; and most recently on Saturday night, my co-worker and I saw a guy just released from county jail trying to get a "refill" of soda with a Circle K cup. This location is also quite the popular day laborer pickup spot.  Service isn't the best, but where is it outstanding when it comes to fast food? My co-workers and I have been to this McDonald's about four times in two years, but it always delivers on seeing "interesting" people. And for that reason, this McDonald's gets two stars.

I met Kristin S. at 98 South last night for drinks and appetizers. What a cute little place! I don't venture down to Chandler too often, but I will in the future for 98 South. The inside is really nice and modern.  I'm a sucker for dimly lit restaurants.  I arrived before Kristin, so I got the only seat left at the bar and ordered a drink while I waited.  The bartenders were very friendly and not pushy at all.  Once Kristin arrived, we got a table in the main dining room area.  Even though I didn't do it, I like how you can create your own wine flight.    We had the cheese plate which was a nice size for $11.  We got french bread, apples, olives, and 5 cheeses. All 5 cheeses were delicious...I think it's the first cheese plate I have ordered out here in the Valley where I loved every cheese. There is usually one cheese that I don't like, but not here. Normally, I'm not a fan of cheddar cheese on cheese plates, but the German cheddar on the 98 South cheese plate was really good and didn't taste like conventional cheddar.  I also tried the crabcake appetizer for $10.  On the plate was two crabcakes...unfortunately they were not that good.  I don't like crispy breading on my crabcakes and I hate filler!!! There was no lump crabmeat in these crabcakes and they were very dry and bland.  The breading and filler was about 95% of the crabcakes with what I guess I could call crabmeat making up the other 5%. I may be being generous with that crabmeat percentage in fact.  I liked 98 South, even though the crabcakes are gross and the wine selection was a tad lacking.  I will still go back and try other stuff on the menu as the overall menu looked pretty good.

I have been to the Parlor twice now for dinner - the first time was on a Thursday night with a group of eight and the second time was with a friend this past Saturday night. This past Saturday night, the restaurant and bar area were packed - luckily my friend and I were able to grab two seats at the bar which is where we dined rather than face a 40 minute wait for a table either inside or outside. The feel of The Parlor is modern but inviting. I love the exposed brick in the bar area.  The pesto pizza (minus the tomatoes) is delicious - it's big enough to share if you want, but not so big that if you ate it yourself you would feel like a pig. The caesar salad is a nice size and would suffice as a meal if you wanted to. The pesto chiatarra pasta is really good. It's the perfect portion size (it also comes with a piece of toasted bread that is great to soak up pesto after you are done with the pasta) and is really flavorful. The tiramisu is the best I have ever tried - it was so light tasting and I would have ate the whole thing if my friend had let me! A single scoop of gelato (I tried the chocolate) is a perfect light dessert.  Not only is the food delicious, but it's perfectly portioned and very reasonably priced. You won't break the bank dining here. On my first trip, my bill came to $20 (after tax and tip) for a salad, beer, and half a 12" pizza. On Saturday night, our bill came to $33 before tip (2 entrees and 2 desserts). Our drinks were paid for by a nice gentleman in the bar area who felt bad about intruding our space when going up to order drinks. If we had paid for our beers, they would have ranged in price from $3.50 to $5. The draft selection is much better than most restaurants and even some bars!  I definitely recommend this place and hope to be back in the near future.

For the past five-ish weeks that I have been a temporary Surprise resident, I have been to the Irish Wolfhound numerous times. It's almost like I am a regular there. I guess I needed a new Irish pub since I am on the other side of the Valley from Rula Bula now.  Everytime I have been to the Wolfhound, it has been busy. Doesn't matter whether it has been a Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, or Monday. It's been busy. It's a sign that a)it has a good atmosphere (love the patio with the firepit); b) the drinks and food are really reasonably priced; and c) the food is way better than you would expect at an Irish pub in Surprise. The cheesecake with Bailey's is so much better than I could have hoped for. Is it NY Cheesecake OMG I want to die good? No, but it is still really tasty while drinking a Harp and playing bar trivia on a Wednesday night. The seafood chowder is a great soup and I don't even like soup!  Service is really speedy and friendly. The Irish Wolfhound hosts Team Trivia on Wednesday evenings which is when you can catch me and some friends defending our nerdiness. If you ever find yourself in Surprise, this is a good spot to check out.

OK, this review is for happy hour only. I plan on trying Marcella's for lunch and/or dinner in the near future, so I'll update once I do.  When I heard Marcella's was opening at Fashion Square, I was so excited. Marcella's originated in Columbus, Ohio, and there are two locations there. My Ohio friends rave all the time about Marcella's -now that it is here in Scottsdale, I finally could find out what all the buzz was about.  Marcella's is located next to Modern Steak and is in the new Barney's wing. Parking is available in the lot across from Grand Lux, and if there are no open spots, in the evening you can park in the underground garage. I met a friend who moved here from Columbus for happy hour last Wednesday night. I arrived first and secured us two spots at the outside bar. Our bartender, Josh (I am pretty sure that was his name), was a sweetheart and chatted with us quite a bit and provided excellent service.  My friend had the red sangria which she really enjoyed while I stuck with Stella Artois. As a note, the beers on draft are Peroni or Stella. No cheapo American beers here on draft thankfully. For food, we had the zucchini, garlic cheese bread, and the pesto shrimp pizza. All the food was really good, especially the pizza. The food was great, but what is even better are the happy hour prices! The appetizers range from $2.25 to $4.95, while the pizzas will run you from $4.95 to $6.50. Beer and sangria are $3, wine by the glass is half off, and martinis and specialty cocktails are $5. Plus happy hour runs from 3-7 pm, so working people can actually make it and enjoy a few drinks. Marcella's definitely has the best happy hour deal in town now that it is open!  I can't wait to go back to try more of the appetizers and to have a full meal. Thank you Cameron Mitchell for expanding Marcella's from Columbus to Scottsdale. You have made this Ohio transplant very happy!

Time for an update - my husband and I went to Marcella's Saturday night for dinner. Wow, what a bummer because we were hoping for so much better.  We started with the calamari...agghhhh, it was so salty. Salty to the point of almost being inedible. However, we ate it because once dipped in the aioli sauce, some of the saltiness was tempered. Barely. I had the caesar salad (quite a steal at $3.95) which was fresh and probably the best part about the meal. My husband had the chicken parm - to sum up his feelings, "I have had better chicken parm at Olive Garden." YIKES!! I stuck with a basic pasta with alfredo sauce...nothing special but not bad. The one good thing about that dish is that they don't try to drown you in pasta - it was quite a reasonable and manageable size dish to eat. For our two drinks, appetizer, salad, and two entrees, our bill came to $64 after tip. Definitely not bad for dinner, but we still left feeling underwhelmed.  I think Marcella's is a good happy hour spot, but not a place I would have another full dinner meal at. Five stars for happy hour, 2.75-3 stars for dinner, hence my ultimate rating of four stars.

I visited the new H&M last Saturday because I needed to get out of the house to allow my husband to grade in peace and because I like H&M and had been needing to get a fix. I left majorly disappointed - not only did I find nothing I liked, but the experience had been majorly frustrating.  I only saw the first level (not having kids or being pregnant I felt no need or desire to go to the second level) and the selection was disheartening. Not only did I see nothing in the men's section that my husband would even consider wearing, but the women's section, while large, had very little I liked. The accessories section, always a favorite of mine in H&Ms, was tiny and extremely lacking in good items.  Apparently a requirement of the girls working at this H&M location is that they a) wear UGG boots and b) look and act completely apathetic. The line for the fitting room was extremely long. Having only two items I should have not even bothered, but for some reason, I stood in line for almost 30 minutes to try on two things that once on I absolutely hated. The worst thing about this H&M is the ten item limit for the dressing rooms! Holy crap that is a high limit. Not only that, if you take back say 30 items, you can leave the other twenty with the girls running the fitting room, try on the first ten and then come back out for the next ten items. Basically one person could hog a dressing room for well over 30 minutes. This is ridiculous especially given the long line for the fitting rooms.  Needless to say, I will wait to get my next H&M fix when I am somewhere else. I don't think I have the patience to drive up to Kierland or deal with this store.

I ate dinner here with two other ladies during a girls weekend to Vegas. We were staying at the Aria and wanted a nice dinner, so we decided to try Julian Serrano before heading to a show and club. I am a huge tapas fan so I was happy to try this place out. Located near the check-in desk and not too far off the casino floor, it is not a hard place to find. Additionally even though we did not have reservations, they sat us right away at 6:30 pm, most likely since we were dining a tad early by Vegas standards.  I'm still getting use to restaurants being hi-tech, so I was surprised when our waiter handed us an IPAD instead of a wine menu. However I didn't need to scroll too far once I saw they had an Albarino (my favorite kind of wine) on the menu. My two dining companions left the ordering to me which was really nice. Thankfully at the end of the meal they thought I did a good job or it could have been disasterous!  For food we got the seared scallop (3 come with the order), pan manchego, bravas potatoes, stuffed piquillo peppers, and the traditional spanish chicken croquetas, topped off with the molten chocolate cake for dessert. The scallops were cooked to perfection (they melted in my mouth) and the peppers had a little kick due to the goat cheese that oozed out of them. I have had better bravas potatoes at other tapas restaurants, but my dining companions really enjoyed them along with the pan manchego. The chicken croquetas were all of our least favorite dish - something about the texture just turned me personally off. The chocolate cake was a nice way to cap the meal and, needless to say, not one bite was left of it.  If Yelp had half stars, I would give it a 3.5, but am rounding up to four because we had very good service, really liked the atmosphere/ambiance of the restaurant, and pretty much all the food we tried was solid. It just didn't blow me away like other tapas places I have been to. On a future Vegas visit, I would come back with more people to try more of the menu as there were plenty of dishes that appealed to me.

On my recent trip to Vegas, I brought my husband to Julian Serrano for their happy hour. The happy hour runs Sunday - Thursday from 4-5:30 pm. Yes it's a bit early, but completely worth it. We went on Sunday and got there slightly after 4 pm. The restaurant was pretty empty, so it was no problem getting two seats at the bar.  We enjoyed the white sangria for $4.50 per glass (red and sparkling sangria will run you $5) as well as a ton of food that cost between $3.50 - $7.00. We enjoyed the spanish tortilla, brava potatoes, pan tomate, fried calamari, and the stuffed dates from the happy hour menu. We also ordered the scallops from the regular menu. Just like my last visit to Julian Serrano, our scallops were cooked to absolute perfection and melted in my mouth. It was truly the highlight of our meal. Everything else was good, although none of it was better than what I have had at other tapas restaurants.  If you don't want to blow your wallet on eating and drinking, I highly recommend checking out this happy hour!

I can't think of a better place to review for my 400th review. I stayed at The Cosmopolitan for three nights this past weekend and it absolutely exceeded my expectations. Not only have I found my new favorite hotel in Vegas, but I think I have found my favorite hotel that I have ever stayed at!  I booked directly via the hotel website and was able to snag a City Room with two queen beds for three nights for $483 which included all taxes and fees. While the City Room is the basic level, it didn't feel basic at all. The best part about our room (5541) was that it had a partial Strip view and overlooked the Bellagio fountains. I don't think there is much that is better than getting ready for a night in Vegas while being able to watch the fountain show.  Overall the room was huge and I imagine if there had only been one bed in the room, it would have felt even bigger. I loved that the bathroom had a separate toilet, so someone could go to the bathroom while another person continued to get ready at the sink and mirror. The shower stall was huge which I appreciated. As a warning, the shower looks out into the room, so if you are sharing a room with someone other than your significant other, make sure to lower the shade! The only negative about the room was that the shower water never got really hot - it got warm and was fine for showering, but as a person who loves a hot shower, it never quite got there.  The whole hotel is sparkly, glitzy, classy, and...well, cosmopolitan. There is a lot of crystals and bling, but it's done in such a modern and beautiful way that is comes across as classy, not cheap or gaudy. There are a ton of bars to sip drinks at with the best one being the multi-level and beautiful Chandelier Bar. Our bartender on Saturday night at Chandelier Bar was really friendly, fast, and chatted with us despite it being pretty busy. This bar/lounge was quickly added to my "must visit" list for Vegas and I will be recommending it to all my friends.  Other little things that I really liked about my stay:  1. It didn't feel like it took forever to walk from one end of the hotel/casino to the other. In some of the other Vegas Strip properties, I feel like I am walking forever to get anywhere.  2. Great location - it's a quick walk to Crystals and Aria on one side, Bellagio on the other, and Planet Hollywood and the Paris across the street.   3. Very friendly service - from the front desk to the guys at the taxi stand, every staff member we encountered during our three night stay was incredibly friendly and really seemed to like their job.   The only real complaint I have was about the elevators - you have to use your room key to access your floor and it took multiple tries on some occasions for it to actually read the card. We heard complaints from fellow elevator passengers about this same issue, including some from people who have stayed at the hotel multiple times since it has opened. Hopefully The Cosmopolitan will fix this issue soon.   I will definitely be staying here on my next visit to Vegas so I can check out the restaurants, pool, spa, and Marquee.

Two of my favorite words are happy hour. Happy hour twice a day every day makes me really happy! Happy hour at Todd English P.U.B. runs from 3-6 pm and then from 10 pm - midnight.   On our first evening in Vegas, my husband and I walked down to this pub for the afternoon/early evening happy hour. We found two seats at the bar, and after a slight wait for service, were helped by an incredibly friendly bartender. This place has an incredible beer list, including one of my favorite beers, the Double Jack. We enjoyed our time at P.U.B. so much that Friday, we returned for the late night happy hour on Saturday with two of our friends. It was much less crowded so getting four seats at the bar was no problem. Again we had super friendly service (much quicker this time too) and our friends were successful in the "7 Second Challenge" (chug a pint of beer in seven seconds or less) so they got their first drinks for free!  The only food I tried was the grilled cheese with brie and bacon. The bacon completely overwhelmed the sandwich and there was just too little brie cheese. I wouldn't order it again, but I would go back and try more of the food.   I will definitely be back at this place on my next visit to Vegas because of the really good happy hour. Check their FB page for the deals!

This is easily the most beautiful bar/lounge I have had the pleasure of having drinks at, not just in Vegas but anywhere I have traveled to. This multi-story lounge inside of a chandelier is such a fresh and modern concept. My sister and I had drinks there on Saturday night after having drinks at some other lounges beforehand since we were staying at The Cosmopolitan.   We cozied up to the bar on the second level and were served by an incredibly friendly and attentive bartender. Despite it being busy, he spent a few minutes chatting with us and even gave us a flower to chew on that numbs your mouth and makes it tingle. Drink prices were typically of most other Vegas lounges. I think the best part about this lounge is that is plenty of seating areas so small and big groups will be able to settle in with some killer drinks in a fabulous setting. This is definitely a must visit when on the Strip.

I ventured over to the Verizon Wireless store on Sunday afternoon because I was eligible for the "new every two" deal that Verizon runs. I wanted to upgrade my phone and ask some questions about plans for smartphones because the Verizon wireless website wasn't very clear.  The store is very clean and laid out well with so many different phones on display that you can try out. There is an area to "check-in" when you enter the store. I didn't check in since when I got to the store, I was the only customer there; later when the store got busy, the check-in kiosk becomes important as it puts you in queue to be helped by a salesperson, customer service rep, or technician.  I was helped by Katie (I think that was her name) and she answered all of my and my husband's questions. She explained the plans very well and made it much easier to understand than how it was presented on the Verizon website. She was so polite and helpful and even set up my email on the Blackberry Curve so I wouldn't have to figure it out.  This is probably the best Verizon store I have been in, and I have been to 5 different stores in 3 states. By far this had the nicest layout, the most organized system to help customers, and the shortest wait time to process a transaction from sale to set up of device of any of the 4 previous Verizon stores I had visited.

I went to Hyde on my last trip to Vegas at the end of September with my husband. I knew it had a view of the Bellagio Fountains, so I convinced the husband to grab some drinks there. Before 10 pm, there is no cover and no line to get in (this was especially great since it was a Friday night). While we didn't get seats, we did have a great standing location near the tables closest to the fountains. Drinks are pricey - we paid $17 each for rum and cokes, but I understand the markup since it's Vegas and because you are getting a great view of the fountain shows.  The space is beautiful and I would not hesitate coming here again on a future Vegas trip for a drink and an upclose view of the famous Bellagio Fountain show!

My husband and I were in Vegas recently and when I heard this show had opened, I knew we had to go (I'm a huge MJ fan). We went on a Monday evening to the 7 pm show. Ordering tickets online was easy and I was able to get us front seats on the aisle. Aisle seats in the lower section is the best way to see this show! The dancers come into the aisle so you can see the amazing costumes and makeup up close. Since we were in the front row, we got to see everything so clearly and at the end of the show got to high-five most of the performers.   The show has great dancing, the amazing Cirque tricks everyone goes to these shows to see and awe at, and all the Michael Jackson hits you want to hear. The hologram MJ is awesome, but my favorite part of the show is the finale with "Black and White". I was literally dancing on my way out of the theater.  For MJ fans, and even non-fans, I highly recommend this show. It was the highlight of my Vegas trip!

It didn't take my husband much to convince me to pop into O'Sheas for a bit during our last trip to Vegas when he said two magic words: "Beer pong". I might have looked a bit out of place in my short party dress and strappy heels when we rolled up to the beer pong tables, but once we got cups and ping pong balls, I was in my element. The pitcher of beer we ended up with was $10, but hey it's Vegas and for a dive casino, I thought it was a good price. I'd hate to see what a pitcher of beer at say the Bellagio would go for. The floors were sticky with beer, so it gave it that frat house feel...well that and the leering guys watching me chase after a ping pong ball.  After a few rounds, we decided to meet up with my brother in law and played slots for a bit. The slots were loose and the cocktail waitress totally fit with what you imagine a cocktail waitress in a dive casino would look like. She was great about coming around very frequently and we never went without a full drink in our hands.   If you want to escape the big name casinos but don't want to leave the Strip, O'Sheas is a fun, low key place.
