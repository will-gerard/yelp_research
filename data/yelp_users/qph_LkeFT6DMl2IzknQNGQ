Yes, I agree this place is a gem.  I have always had terrific food here (the gyros and salad's  are awesome).  ALWAYS fresh.  A little expensive considering it's a dive (a very clean one though).  And i have had co-workers complain they don't give you enough food.  But giving 5 stars based on the quality of the food

This very cozy cute cafe is a little hard to find, even though it's right off 1-10 and 40th st.  If you are a fan of independent unique restaurants, you should like this place.  The food is good, the atmosphere is even better.  All wood, very cozy and quaint.  I usually get the chicken sandwich which comes with avocado and bacon, and their fries are fresh cut.  It is comfort food at its best.    I have heard their breakfast is great, but i believe they are open only M-F 6:00 am - 2pm (closed weekends).   If this is close to you for lunch/breakfast during the week, you shoudn't be disappointed .

They must be reading these post that they are 'affordable' - I got talked into an upcharge of $30 for what seems like a standard pedicure anywhere else.   Right when my pedicure was finished I was rushed out of my seat and into my sandals(not even time for the polish to dry).  Not coming here again.

I usually order (and love) their shrimp burrito (i always order with avocado)...most time it is very good sometimes just good.  I went there today, and would rate 3 stars based on today's experience  (the flour tortilla was a little hard, generally didn't taste as fresh).  I am giving a 4 because it is usually much better.  The service is always great too - I believe 3 sisters own the place.   Last time we went on 10/23,  the Food Network was filming there- the film crew mentioned they would be profiling this place (showing in the spring) along with Matt's Big Breakfest in the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show.

4.5 stars.  I had their Bombero Burrito with green chile for the first time today...was SOOOO good.  I disagree with Shaun C.  I love the sauce they have in this burrito....

I went here based on the other yelp reviews.   The lemon chicken bowl I had was tasty and cheap, and yes, like the other reviewers the Japanese owner put a smile on my face!  He just seems genuinely interested in every customer :).

I'm really happy with this gym.  Would highly recommend it to anyone, the group fitness classes alone are worth the membership costs even if you only go a few times a month.  I also like the LifeCafe restaurant inside...I love the pesto chicken salad (if you need extra protein after your workout tell them to throw in some spicy peanuts ...sooo good with that salad.)

Wow!  This place also knocked my socks off....I had the Green Flannel Hash - Extremly Delicious, and a side Jalapeno Pecan pancake as my fellow yelpers recommended...both were incredible (although I am not a big pancake/sweet fan so only had a few bites of the pancake before I grew tired of it).  I went both times on a weekday, so not too busy but still took a good 1/2 hour to get the food...Well Worth the Wait.

Last night, after deciding Four Peaks was too busy for after hike beers, we headed to Dos Gringos which was much less busy...  Not sure why it was not more busy, the layout of this place is great (as Amber W. notes half inside/half outside).    The bartenders were extremely attentive and kept filling out water glasses  without asking as well as our cheap ($2) coronas (thirsty from the hike :)).  The clientele was diverse even though right by ASU (not just college kids).  Definitely a fan!  Very impressed!

I need to go to more places like this...the mushroom portobello sandwich I ordered was awesome and seemed healthy (called EAST on the menu).  My only complaint about the food was the Focaicca bread seemed slightly stale - I hate that. The night we went they were swamped so the service wasn't smooth (they forgot our reservations!!)...but grateful that the waitress recommended that sandwich!  Love the location in Old Town Scottsdale

I have been here twice and both times have been in awe of the food and the place in general.  I came here specifically to try the open face steak sandwich mentioned by Stevey P, but both my sister and I were so bummed when we arrived because they said they were out...I perused the menu for an althernative and the server recommended the special which was the grass-fed hamburger. It did not sound appealing and I try to avoid eating red meat in general... but I was amazed at the freshness of the hamburger, the toppings, the sauce and everything is so fresh, you don't that icky feeling at all after eating here...also the portions are not too large...perfect size for me.   I will definitely be a regular here..

Still a fan...But the 5 stars was for what  the server told me was the special every Friday --  the grass fed hamburger - This was incredible and everything else i have had here so far as been good, but not the perfection that the hamburger was ( I know, I should wait a few times before reviewing a place)

So good!  4.5 stars.  Like the others said bring cash.  We had the short ribs and barbeque chicken.....awesome.  They offer double meat option...would recommend that because portions are small otherwise.

My dog came in with what they told me was a  fractured toe (he is all better now) ...It was very expensive (Over $1200 and all he really needed was a splint- not sure he even needed that).     The surroundings are impressive - like a real hospital, extremely clean and spacious.  The bill was astronomical, they have a huge billing staff  that  seemed ready to calculate all the costs...I definitely will not be going back.

I will not recommend this place...  I ended up here because a friend chose to have her B-Day get-together here, and after reading the other reviews, I decided to stick with drinks only.  I had the red Sangria and loved it.  In fact, I went the very next day with another friend to order that  drink again, but this time the drink was flavorless and did not taste the same.  When I questioned the bartender, he was kind of un- gracious and mumbled something like I probably got the end of a batch or something..... I usually don't notice bad service but this time I did (even before I tasted the bad Sangria).

Fast food sushi -- I introduced this place to my sister and brother-in-law and they love it....interesting atmosphere with the revolving belt (great if your attention deficient), decent to good sushi, and downright cheap - I think they lowered their prices since Sarah G. reviewed (range is $1-2 a plate).  I agree not to expect fine-dining but will give you the sushi-fix at a great price.  Also with the revolving sushi - bar concept you get instant gratification (My advice is to wait until something looks really good before picking up - they have some really good stuff but also alot of mediocre sushi on the line. We also noticed that a lot of Japanese frequent the place - always a good sign.

This place recently opened, it is clear Pan Asia knows what they are doing... I have only been here once, but so far the only thing i question is how they can offer such great quality/quantity for the prices on the menu (low).  It doesn't seem like that can last...hopefully they don't read this and come to their senses...  I had the lunch special sushi roll (it's simply called 'A' on the menu) with eel roll, salmon and spicy tuna roll which  came with soup and ginger salad with great dressing, it was ALOT of food, and everything was great.

I'm very busy at work today but wanted to take a quick couple minutes to yelp about this place...  The carne asada burrito was great - alot of flavor, juicy, did not make my stomach hurt (like places like Filibertos sometimes do).  I'm confused at some of the reviews that call it pricey....My lunch companion mentioned it was extremely cheap (and he always complains about high prices so that is saying something!).  The place is very cute and just a perfect little place to grab a simple, delicious lunch (if you like carne asada like I do).

I also love this place!   My sister mentioned a "pizza place" she saw on yelp, this place is so much more than just a pizza place though ... very well-rounded ....great food, reasonable prices, nice ambience.   We had the duck sandwich and spagetti bolognese....they nailed both dishes....we left very happy.  Go here before it gets too busy (we went on a weekday at 12 and got seated right away..i can see this place becoming over-crowded soon).

5 stars...This place made my day!  I live near Tukee, therefore I am warped right, but I think the space is great, cool atmosphere, and delicious food.   I had the pork sandwich which had tangy coleslaw,  mustard seeds, and apple slices among other unique fillings.   I like that it was not too barbequey like most pork sandwiches i have had.   It has the feel of being a more established restaurant though i learned they opened up December 2009.  I thought the layout/ design had a modern industrial feel and lots of light.  I agree this place is a relief to the area (:  Go check it out!

Still love Hillside Spot.  The management seem to do one thing particularly well besides quality yum food- they seem keep their employees happy.  Many of the staff are have been employed there for years and are very professional, friendly and laid back group. Just a unique feature of this restaurant vs. others in this area.

This place is not in my hood but would definitely make the drive to this place over and over if it stays as good as today!  I felt immediately welcome by the cook and cashier when i walked in...I asked what they recommened and both said the chicken shawarma...I ordered the sandwich with the new garlic sauce for lunch today.....WOW.   The chicken was perfectly spiced and fresh along with the pita and other vegetables.  The prices are low too.    This was my first time, and since it's an independant shop i'm hoping will stay consistent.

I have been lacking in Yelp Reviews lately, but after the 10th time my sister and I have been here after discovering this place a couple of months ago.....she said outloud, "Yelp this place, I would be so upset if it closed!!"  I believe it has been opened for less than a year, the only drawback is although the place is nicely decorated it is maybe a bit depressing inside and no patio dining, so I suggest takeout if this is important to you.  I recommed the Chicken Pumpkin Curry and House Peanut Salad....So Fresh and So Good.

I just talked to Ron on the phone and gave him a list of things I needed done.  They fell outside his specialty, but he took the time to tell me the services I needed done that might be better suited to handyman work vs. plumber (to possibly save money).   Always appreciate advice on saving money!

I love this place!!!  They are very hard working therapists that offer massage for extremely reasonable prices.  I can afford to be a regular here because of the low cost.

Not a 5 star experience for me - the greek salad and meatloaf sandwich i ordered were average (zero culinary expertise with either of these) and it was  pricey!!  The bread that came with the salad was good, as was the cookie , but I can not see myself coming back here.  Not a neighborhood 'gem' for me.

I definitely get the 5 star reviews for Stell Roofing.  Here is our experience.  We bought our house in early 2013 and the home inspector at that time noted the roof needed to be replaced within a couple of years.  Fast-forward to 2015, we started to put this on the priority to get done.  Stell Roofing was the fifth and final quote  - he stated it was his opinion that the roof had a few years of life left and did not currently need replacement.  We will definitely be using Mike in our future roof replacement but glad we have a couple more years to prepare for this large expense!!

YUM!!  I had the steak schwarma pita today and it was awesome - the steak was super flavorful and the dill sauce was great.  I would definitely give it 5 starts, but I went here months ago and it wasn't nearly as good.  I'll update this review if it stays consistent.

We just enrolled our son in this daycare.   So far, we are very happy with what we have experienced.  We were not really looking to switch daycare, but my sister mentioned Maple Bear to us because they offer bilingual education.  Our son is only 6 months old,  so we researched this daycare for future enrollment only.    We then opted for this daycare because we saw they offer a 3:1 infant to teacher ratio for a comparable cost of what we were paying at our previous daycare for a 5:1 ratio. Also,  the staff seem very engaged with the children and they have a nice facility and outdoor area.   This is a brand new daycare center so they don't have alot of kids yet (a plus in our book because our son is so young, more attention for him!)   I'm hoping the enrollment numbers go up so they stay in business - I think they offer a much higher quality product for a comparable cost of what you would pay at other daycares.  I recommend checking them out!!

I am so grateful for Maple Bear!  Compared to our previous daycare, Maple Bear is a night/day difference.  He gets  better care here - the infant teachers (Belinda and Rosalva) are excellent -- caring, personable and knowledgable.  I normally don't write updates to reviews but they have really provided my husband and I with piece of mind for our little one :).

This is the first restaurant in my recent experiences that the food truly felt like someone's personal effort.  Both my husband and I were extremely impressed with the quality and uniqueness of our dishes (also the pricing which is low!).  When ordering I asked what was recommended and girl at register suggested the "Shepard's Biscuit" and "Mushroom Crepe".  Both sounded too heavy but we ordered anyway.   It turned out to be fresh, flavorful and much lighter than I expected.  Extremely happy with our experience,  and we are already recommending to our friends.  The only small flaw was the patio had some flies which was a tad annoying but won't prevent us from returning very soon.
