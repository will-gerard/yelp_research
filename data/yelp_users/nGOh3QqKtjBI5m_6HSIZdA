My husband and I were invited to a Phoenix Suns game, this one versus the Sacramento Kings.  Not being an advid fan of basketball, this was my first time to a basketball arena to see a game up close and personal.    The US Airways Center was a great sight to be seen.  Even though I felt I was being advertised to the whole night (I need Coke, not wait Jack in the Box,  ooo a Toyota, I need it now!), they definitely keep you entertained.  It was The Gorilla's birthday that night complete with visiting mascots, cupcakes for fans, and a former American Gladiator v. mascot showdown.  Although the most exciting thing to watch was all the Kings players that would run into Shaq, almost fall down and Shaq would just stand there, like a brick wall.  That and after the dancers performed to an Aerosmith song, the stadium played Aerosmith's "Dude Looks Like a Lady," as they exited!  HA!  There's a good variety of food, I had Caesar salad with flat bread in a cup, a nice change of pace compared to ballpark food.  The hubby had Subway. Good times were had by all and the Suns trounced the Kings.

Umm, who took the flavor from my food?  Bland, bland and more bland.  Apparently they only flavor things here by throwing cheese on it.    Ordered the Tacos Morongo, which sounded a lot like the tacos I've enjoyed at roadside taco carts in Mexico, with avocado puree in little corn tortillas.  Great in theory, poor in execution.  The steak was tough and it didn't even taste like they salt and peppered it for flavor. The other ingrdients faded into nothing.  The hubby's Machaca platter, which the server couldn't decide if it was spicy beef or pork, we're pretty sure it was unspicy pork.    Portions are large.  Chips and salsa are endless but canned crushed tomatoes, onions and cilantro do not a good salsa make.  Anyone heard of garlic? Jalapenos? Fresh ingredients?  Bah, two stars for being atleast edible and because I feel bad for my friends who like coming here.

Simple math:  1 Pint Hop Knot + 2 Hot Bavarian Pretzels with Spicy Mustard = 21 hours of being awake totally worth it

Mi Cocina Mi Pais is the reason I love Yelp:  finding authentic hole-in-the-wall restaurants, that are family run and leave you curious to try more.  Thanks Yelpers!    We stopped off here on our way to the Surprise Stadium for our last spring training game of the weekend.  They offered authentic South American beers: I had the Quilmes, which the server accurately described as similar to a Hennekin, and the hubby tried the dark beer but the name escapes me now.  I ordered the fish in banana leaf served with rice and plantain chips and the hubby got the pork tamales.  Both were delicious!  The fish was firm, served in a smoky paprika veggie sauce and the tamales were amazing!  They were moist and flavorful. I kept stealing from my husband and I don't even care that much for tamales.  They served chips and fresh salsa, none of that canned tomato stuff.  I would love to try one of their ceviches but I guess I'll have to wait until 2009 Spring Training.  Dang it.

Still a delightful little South American restaurant! We went back again this year and I got my Peruvian ceviche as I promised myself on last year's spring training trip.  A large pile of citrus cured white fish with celery, red onion boiled yam and potato.  It had a good amount of heat to it, though I couldn't tell what it was coming from.  I got the tamale sampler and it was great.  If I had to choose I'd pick the Ecuadorian tamales hands down.  Hubby ordered a pork empanada, which was really good.  Light, flaky crust, and not thick or oily.  The couple that owns it are really sweet and the wife, who apparently is the head chef, also came out to our table to check on us and thanked us for coming.  Oh, and hubby had the Xangu beer again, the one I couldn't remember from last time.

Nice field and very appropriate home for the Giants, very metropolitan (turn the corner and you're there, right in Old Town Scottsdale).  Go a few blocks up from the stadium and you can park on the street for free.  Please drive past the $20 parking lot, that's just ridiculous.    The food looked great, although we didn't partake.  Would've definitely gotten those wok fried noodles though.  The lawn seats were completely full and I love the look and feel of them.  The outfield seemed a little cluttered with makeshift stands and advertisements or maybe that was because we were sitting straight across from the Dos Gringos hut and it was all I could see from right field.  We're not fans of the Giants, but hey we wanted to see all we could during our first spring training trip.  Angels trounced them anyway.

The only way I was able to visit this well to do, upscale country club was a wedding the hubby and I attended this weekend.  Ancala is a beautiful country club with a great views of the golf course from the outdoor patio and bar.  The ceremony was held outside in the heat but luckily the planners were wise enough to place the multiuse outdoor patio on the east side of the main clubhouse to provide ample shade in the late afternoon.  You Arizoinans know your sundials.    We did get a sneak peak at the wedding coordinator's style and professionalism since we did some extra work for our friend the groom.  Dawn and her team were right on cue and nothing but accomodating and thorough with both the ceremony and reception.  She even carried a orange clipboard to match the wedding colors.  Dinner was decent for wedding food and their house wine wasn't bad either.  As a guest we had an enjoyable time at Ancala.

Yum!  Despite enduring the inevitable pasty v. pastee conversations (with my own party as well as the one that sat next to us), I have nothing but kind words for Cornish Pasty Co.    My Pepper Steak Pasty was delicious with Stilton blue cheese, zucchini, leeks, and big chunks of steak.  All of my favorite flavors in a nice, cute little package!  Boddington's on tap!   Please, tell me, when are you coming to San Francisco?

For my 200th review I want to send my love to my ever changing, unpredictable, everybody-wants-to-count-you-out Oakland A's and their spring training venue.  Being it my first time to spring training and the fact that I am an A's fan who regularly attends games in the great concrete jungle, I'm not hard to impress.    The field was all that baseball needs to be: hot dogs, beer, eager fans, and a green field.  We saw two games here, one of which was free thanks to the nice guy who bought too many tickets and gave two to us.  Thanks baseball fans, you guys are the best!

Oh, why oh why didn't I just order the falafel platter?!?  I would have just liked, and not loved, Sabuddy Israeli had it not been for the $.50 falafel I had on the side of my shawarma sandwich.  The pita sandwich was good, but not having shawarma before I discovered it is not my favorite Israeli cuisine.  It was well seasoned with yellow curry all the way through the chicken, not overpowering but I just don't seem to care for yellow curry.  The pita also had tomato, an israeli pickle, lettuce (with a touch of lemon) and tahini.     I ended up ordering four falafel balls total, in addition to my sandwich. They are the perfect combination of hand ground garbanzo beans, garlic and a hint of cumin.  They are crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  All other falafels fail in comparison.  Next time I visit I solemnly vow to order the falafel platter complete with tabboulah, hummus and babaganooj.

Oh how sad!  My husband has been talking and talking and talking about coming back for their falafels when we go back to Scottsdale for Spring Training in March.  Now I have to tell him the bed news...*tear.

In the chaos that was downtown Tempe on St. Patrick's Day, we stumbled upon this recently opened pizza and wine bar.  A few parties were scattered across the restaurant around 6:30pm, but filled in quite nicely as we finished our meal.  The interior is upscale without being stuffy.  Floor to ceiling curtains hide the kitchen, exposed brick walls and mirrored dividers contribute to the intimate setting.  The bar has a large mural of a 16th century woman which somehow remains the focal point of the restaurant without being creepy.    Our server was friendly and gave us plenty of time to be indecisive.  We finally ordered the bruschetta starter ($12) which allows you to pick four out of eight different offerings.  My group settled on prosciutto, goat cheese and spinach, kalamata olive with basil ricotta, caprese, and sausage with eggplant babaganoush.  It's served on a wood cutting board with pitted olives.  This is one of the best starters I've had in a while.  Big thick pieces of toasted bread, cut in two, perfect for sharing over a glass of wine.  The prosciutto and caprese were my personal favorites but all were a definite hit!    We also ordered a couple of Caesar salads ($7 each), which were decent but nothing extraordinary and a little over dressed, and three pizzas ($12-13 each): Prosciutto, fungi and sausage.  The pizzas were good, each combination carefully selected with complimenting flavors.  My favorite was the sausage, served with roasted fennel.   The prosciutto had the right balance of crisp prosciutto, artichokes and capers. These two were a little heavy on sauce for my taste, but it didn't overwhelm the toppings. The mushroom pizza, a white pizza, could have been better by less white mushrooms and more crimini and maybe some chantrels.   The wine list is not extensive but carefully chosen and our Paso Robles Cab went well with all our selections.  They were out of the Argentinian Malbec, sigh, it's my favorite.    La Bocca was a delightful change from the rowdy college scene of Mill Avenue, but at a price point comfortable enough for anyone to enjoy.  We'll definitely make a point of stopping in next time we're in Arizona.

Surprise was definitely the prettiest stop along our Spring Training tour this year. Parking was free.  The ticket lines (despite having 9 functioning windows) were slow.  Luckily we got to the window to find out they had just opened up seats right behind home plate for only $22!   I was however, completely turned around by entering from the ticket windows to the outflield.    This stadium is still crisp and clean and have the most seats in the shade out of the three we visited.  We are definitely ready for the season to begin!

If I could have a bistro style restaurant on beck and call I think it would be The Spoon Cafe.  We ventured out to the Northeast Scottsdale for breakfast on Sunday morning.  It's located across the street from Mastro's, at Pinnacle Peak and North Pima.    It was definitely a quiet Sunday morning, only a few tables filled, but fit our relaxed, we're-not-completely-awake-give-me-coffee mood. The server was very friendly and knowledgable about the food.  I ordered the Spanish Frittata and the hubby ordered the Croque Madame.  The frittata was perfectly baked with green pepper, onion, tomato, cheese and a delicious garlicly basil pesto.  I wanted to ask for a cup of the pesto on the side to eat with a spoon.  The Croque Madame was basically an open face breakfast sandwich: grilled ciabata, grilled deli-sliced ham, cheese, tomato and topped with two sunny side up eggs.  Every bite had a little of everything.  Both were served with ranch potatoes and the frittata came with toast.  Coffee was smooth and way better than any diner coffee I've had.  The rest of the menu from lunch to dinner looked intriging and something we will be back for. Dinner looked to have a good amount of Italian options including a Veal Ossobucco as well as specials like New York Strip and Coq a Vin. They have lunch box specials during the week with grilled paninis for $5.99.    The outdoor seating and bar looked like a great place to hang out on a pleasant evening with the front of store tarp rolled up, music playing and locals conversing.  The decor is modern but comfortable.  We can't wait to come back!

Great beverage depot with a large selection of wines, beer and spirits.  We spent a good amount of time and money here this past weekend going to various dinner parties with friends around Phoenix. The layout is really easy to work and we found quite a few of our favorite wines at very reasonale prices, including the Bodega Norton Reserve Malbec 2006.  Not the 2005, but still a darn good wine! They carried some familiar Livermore Valley wines and we even took a chance on a Sav Blanc from Chile called Anekena.  At $8 a bottle it was tough to beat.  They offer wine tastings in the center of the store on the weekends too.

Happy hour here did the job.  It wasn't anything amazing but our group was having trouble deciding.  We ordered rolled tacos, the sampler platter and chili cheese dip. The chili cheese dip was actually the highlight, made with green chilis and real cheese. Unfortunately their tableside guacamole and any of the seafood appetizers, like ceviche, are not included in happy hour prices.  We had six drinks total between the four of us, although my friend's fruit margarita didn't taste like it had any tequila.  For all the food and drinks we got away with only spending $40 for the four of us.

Unfortunately you can only get in here if you are a member, or if you know a member, which we did.  There was nothing quite like our visit to the Whisky society with a couple of Leithians during our stay in Edinburgh.  The basic premise of the Whiskey Society is that they are a group that purchase barrels of whisky from distilleries and bottle it untouched, cask strength, no mixing involved.  Most major distilleries are expected to produce a signature flavor and so they mix their barrels to achieve this for bottling.  So even if you knew which distillery the whisky came from (all whiskies are numbered rather than include the name of the distillery) it doesn't taste like what you would normally expect.  The Whisky Society bottles up the barrel sells them to their members and once it's gone, it's gone.    We came on a quiet weekday night. They have a full dinner menu which was really good.  I tried the venison burger and hubby had the bangers and mash complete with the Whisky Society's signature sauce, Hotscotch.  We tried about 10 samples of whisky through out dinner, complete with tasting notes and then my husband went to the bar and tried a couple more before coming away with a prized bottle.    If you ever have the opportunity to visit and sample this fine selection of whiskies you must!

Nice, neat and new! We made our way out to Camelback Ranch last week to check out the newness and the sideshow act that is Manny Ramirez.  It's a beautiful facility devoid of advertising cluttering the outfield with Salty Senorita signs, for now anyway.  Really good beer selection, make sure you look for the indiscrete little cart behind the bleachers on the thrid base side: $6.25 for Pyramid, Fat Tire and another microbrew I can't remember, but worth the money when Miller Lite is like $6.  Parking tip: Yes it is $5-6 for parking but make sure you drive past the first entrance and take the Ballpark Blvd entrance.  The parking lot puts you right at the home plate entrance and right behind player parking.  Easy in, easy out.

We ventured to Maryvale twice during our Spring Training adventures.  It was #1 and #5 of our 6 games last week, seeing the Brewers play the Rangers and A's respectively.  And yes, I too have not seen that many bathrooms in one place either. It is something to be commented on.  We bought bleacher seats the first game but wandered around and sat on the grass on both sides of the stadium. The second game we bought lawn seats but sat toward the end of the bleachers near the third base bull pen.  The attendants didn't look at tickets, unless of course you were trying to sit behind home plate.  That might change as more fans make their way to Maryvale.   They bring out the Sausage Race before the 7th inning stretch and have the sausages available for autographs after the race in right field.  I'd only ever seen them in the highlight reels, so it was fun! Be sure to get there quickly though, the volunteers will cut off the line because, as we were told, "They can't stay in those suits all day!" We even saw one of Brewers hit a home run right through the open square in the hitter's wall in center field.  Hoped he would get an extra point or at least win a stuffed animal as he crossed home plate.    Beer selection is minimal and food is pretty basic, although there is a BBQ stand in the patio behind home plate along with funnel cake and kettle corn.
