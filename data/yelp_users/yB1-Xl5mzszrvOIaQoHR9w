It's my favorite sushi place in the east valley. The roll selection is amazing and unique. And, if you ask him, Saki will make you something not on he menu. The ginger bomb roll is a new creation that is not on the menu, and it has just been added to my favorite list. Best place for rolls in all of Phoenix.

This is my FAVORITE yoga studio. The teachers have the spirit of yoga. It is a welcoming place, non-competitive, and true to the true practice of yoga teaching several kinds of yoga. I appreciate this place so much. Many yoga studios are just exercise classes or they seem competitive or elitist or do not teach to "honor your body." Gilbert yoga is true to The TRUE PRACTICE OF YOGA. I love it! After going to India and experiencing amazing gurus, I returned to realize that this studio really had the spirit of yoga.  Sidenote: I went to a class with a friend at another studio I used to attend years ago. The teacher was irresponsible as a teacher and encouraged discomfort, encouraged being at the edge ... of injury, I think. And shivasana was just a few minutes, which was a shame.

This place is legit. I read an article about it having authentic food from the shaanxi (?) province, and I wanted authentic food. I asked about recommendations that are authentic and specific to the province. The lady recommended the biang biang noodles, which are handmade noodles, long and wide, with pork in a little broth. Oh yum! This dish is delicious and so flavorful. The other thing I tried was the pita bread lamb soup. Who knew lamb was a regular dish in Chinese cuisine? Not me. So, since this it is an authentic dish, I tried it. Very flavorful and almost rich in flavor. It was very good and also a bit interesting. The biang biang noodles were my favorite. Next time I will return with friends so we can sample more.

Excellent Peruvian food. I've been to Peru and frequent Peruvian restaurants in AZ. The ceviche mixto is magnificent! The saltado is still my favorite dish. I ordered to go, so I missed the beautiful presentation, but the quality was amazing. The chicha morada was good, slightly less sweet than others I've had, which made it even better. We aso ordered the fish with pisco sauce and cheese topped with crab and shrimp, which was a large portion making me feel like it was worth the cost. I would recommend this restaurant. High quality meat and fish were used. Clearly high quality ingredients. The saltiness was as should be of saltado.

I will not return. I got the ceviche special. They should NOT call it ceviche.The ceviche tostadas had no fish and barely a piece of shrimp on each one. It was tomato and onion and was more like salsa or pico de gallo. Also, the inside smells bad, unappetizing bad, so I sat outside.

Absolutely delicious. I had a chicken roti. It was super meaty and tender. The crust was delicious. I am full halfway through, but I am pretty sure I will keep eating since it's so darn good.

Tim was very professional and explained everything very well. I researched and found the A+ BBB rating and that they have been in business for over 25 years. I did not feel pressured or sold to, and I even cancelled another company as I found better service and professionalism with Wolff. He even gave me a sheet that compared systems in columns and broke down the cost. It helped me make my decision and not feel taken advantage of and helped me compare. In the end, I felt like I was making a more educated decision. They install tomorrow. I will update then.

Three men all very nice, professional amd efficient. I am pleased with the heating system. It blows much better than what I had. It is quiet. Also, because it blows well, I think I will be able to have the heat set to lower temp (and hopefully in summer the AC set higher temp). They explained how to use my new thermostat. They used booties when in the house and then put canvas down to cover the carper foe hauling stuff in and out. They even vacuumed up afterwards.  Great experience.

I felt like they were trying to get more money out of me. My dog threw up when he walked in and they took him right back. He got bit by something and was getting swollen, which is why we went to the vet after I gave him 50mg benedryl.  It was $345 for critical care less than five minutes after we walked in the door. I was glad they took him back right away. That was great. Clinical care was good. Less than 25 minutes later, the vet was trying to get me to agree to let them keep my dog there to monitor. I just paid $345 for iv fluids, benedryl and steroids, blood work and the exam. That had not been completed, and they already wanted more money. The vet seemed purposefully vague. I do clinical evaluations in hospitals for work. I expected an assessment and plan, which is standard medical practice. The vet was not giving it to me and was just pushing for him to stay. She was trying to get me to say yea to them keeping him and and I had to ask if it would cost more, was not stated, and she said yes but did not say how much. (Found out later would have been $298 more)  I said I wanted to see my dog first before agreeing to anything. An hour later I saw him. He was very dehydrated, and the iv bag was not even halfway through. I said I wanted the iv bag completed since I already paid for it. They said it would take too long and agreed to give it subcutaneously. (So, I paid $345 for critical care including that iv and you won't finish it? But he was bad enough you wanted to keep him to monitor?)  I clarified that it was an anaphylactic reaction, which the vet had been shying away from saying in her very vague statements earlier, which they said it probably was. I said that provided the steroids were working, which they clearly were, then the hypersensitive immune reaction, which is what allergic reactions are, was taken care of and he did not need to stay.   My baby is home safe and sound. They did a great job with the clinical care, but I had to be pushy to get any questions answered and to get my dog home. They tried to get me to drop money while I was a nervous mom. I should not have had to feel pushy to say no to more observation fees when it was less than 25 minutes since our arrival and ivs were just started. I have decent medical awareness. If I didn't I am sure I would have paid that additional $298 plus observation fees (over the $345 initial fee) to make sure my dog was ok. Not cool.

I haven't had Hong Kong style pot pot since I lived in Manila, so I was so excited to hear about Tien Wong Hot Pot. It was delicious. It's also fun to eat as a family putting different foods into the broth. It's a great experience for a meal to share and talk. Very cute and chic ambiance. Professional and attentive service. I will go back again and again.

I am so grateful for Becky's help and guidance. I am achieving my goals. Tonight was my fourth session, and I have  given her my complete trust and confidence. With Becky's help, my stress has gone away, the pounds are going away, and my motivation is up.   I am a successful person with a good career. I am a take charge kind of person, and I finally reached out for help when I did not have results on my own and realized I needed help. That was the first step. The next step was building trust, which I was not going to give without qualifying her. She is very ethical and honorable and has produced amazing results. I gave her my trust, and since then she has been leading me to my potential.

David was awesome, informative and very professional. I will use Plumbing Medic again when I need any help. He was also able to tell me more about home water filters, which I am interested in having in the future. I have hot water in my guest bath again, and it was a pleasant experience. He even cleaned the drain.  Highly recommended.

Best Chinese food in Gilbert/Mesa and at great prices. They have authentic dishes found only at authentic places. The mei fun is awesome. You MUST try the fried dumplings for am old standard, which are the best I have ever had. Yummy.

Yummy. The street tacos are delicious and they are not skimpy with them. Good price point. Friendly people working there. Solid place for a meal. I am pretty sure this will become a regular lunch spot for me.

Sadly, the sauce was terrible last time I went. I don't know what happened to their quality control. I take clients there regularly. This location is SO NOISY and constant whistles and sirens is annoying. I will not go to this location again. Also, the location on Alma School has better sauce and better service as well as atmosphere.

I went to First Watch with a friend for breakfast. The waitress was not friendly. She never brought me the water I asked for. She gave me the coffee my friend ordered. She said they do not have gluten free items. I asked if they at least had gluten free bread and she said no. She did not even try to be helpful.  So, my friend and I left. Poor service. Not a place to go if you are gluten sensitive. Definitey NOT the same service as First Watch in Phoenix, which I frequent for lunch. I will not go again.
