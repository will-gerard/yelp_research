As someone on a gluten-free diet, I was very excited to hear that Streets of New York is offering gluten-free pizza crust. If you have ever had Amy's or any other common g/f rice crust pizza, I would say stick with that.  The gluten free pizza was upwards of $12 before toppings, and each additional topping was a ridiculous $2+. I'm sorry, but toppings don't cost that much even in Vegas and Disney World (two expensive places I've been to recently).  I do not recommend this restaurant one iota if you are going for the g/f pizza. The frozen pizza from Fry's natural food section is just as good if not better, because it's considerably cheaper and you can buy your own toppings for the cost of just one at this restaurant.

I believe that if Pets Inc. advertised that they catered more to just reptile and aquarium enthusiasts, they wouldn't receive such negative reviews from dog/cat owners. I am a dog owner myself, and was surprised when I first went there and found that they didn't carry many dog or cat items. I really do find their selection of reptile and aquarium supplies to be top-notch and would not hesitate to recommend Pets Inc. to any reptile or aquarium owner.

I absolutely adore this place! The food is very traditional, and is delicious. Their lunch buffet is a great deal, but usually I take the sit-down-and-order route. Their lamb korma is the best I've had to date, and their naan is delicious. Their daal leave something to be desired, but I am not a big fan of daal to begin with, so don't take my word for it. Their raita, on the other hand, is ambrosial. I would highly recommend Priya for lunch or dinner. The only drawback is that the service can be just a little cold at times.

If you're tired of canned soda that have more salt than REAL sugar, you should definitely take a little field trip to Pop the Soda Shop. They have any and all kinds of soda. My personal favorite is Birch Beer, of which they easily have 10+ varieties. They have anything you could imagine, and you can make your own 6 packs. They also have most of their sodas chilling in cases in the back so you can drink one on your way out! Amazing place.

First I would like to say that Pho is overrated. It is pretty much the same everywhere, and it is delicious everywhere. I am not going to try to convince you to try Pho, because I never order it myself.  I usually order Bun, which is a dish of room-temperature vermicelli rice noodles on a bed of cucumbers, greens, and basil. On the top of all of this deliciousness is usually some sort of meat, usually pork or beef. I personally like the combination of spring rolls, shrimp, and pork/beef. Over all of this is what is called a fish sauce, but doesn't have a fishy taste and is rather sweet and savory.  The Bun at Khai Hoan is comparable to all the other Bun dishes I've had in the past. I feel that Bun and Pho are two Thai dishes that are difficult for restaurants to screw up.  Before you leave, don't forget to get a Thai iced or hot tea. It's inexpensive, delicious, and they have to-go cups.

Three words: gluten free pizza.   At a reasonable price, too!  I have eaten at Spinato's many times before, but it has been a few years as I have given up gluten (protein in wheat). Mentioning that I miss pizza at dinner yesterday, a new friend noted that Spinato's had gluten-free pizza! I was so happy to hear they added it to their menu.   Tonight for dinner, I ordered a 10" gluten free pizza with pepperoni, feta cheese, and diced garlic for $12.90 (pick up). It was bigger than 10" and was so delicious! Much better than the pathetic excuse for a pizza they serve at Streets of New York. I am definitely coming back here soon to order all the pizza I've missed out on these last few years.

I've always wanted to stay here, and finally my man and I got to this past January for our 3rd anniversary. It is definitely a beautiful and very nice hotel. Its rooms are very clean and upscale, and the beds are comfortable.   The gaming floor is expansive and easier to navigate than most. As a 1 cent slot machine player, I cannot attest to any other games, but their payout is great here. It's not as good as the Monte Carlo's, but what are you going to do? It's not as nice a hotel, therefore it has not as good payout.  I would definitely stay here again.

By far and away one of the best Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurants in Tempe, Efe's has been one of my favorite dinner and lunch spots for years. Everything I have ordered there has been delicious, but the dish I would recommend the most is the Iskender Donnner. It is lamb that has been cooked (to my knowledge) on a spit and then  placed on a bed of tomato yogurt-soaked flatbread. It is amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant to those who enjoy a great atmosphere and even better food.

Having recently discovered they have an extensive gluten-free menu (and baking day), I have fallen in love with this place. I've only been there once, but the cinnamon chip bread I got was incredible! I toast it and put cream cheese and cinnamon sugar on the top, but that's beside the point. They have an extensive menu of gluten-free items and bake all of them fresh on Tuesday afternoons. I will most likely update this review as my gluten-free bread bliss here develops.

I really love this place. It never fails to be high quality and delicious. My only complaint would be the amount/type of seating, but that is just a mere location issue. And as far as cheese wiz vs. provolone or whatever people use on their cheese steaks, I think it's however you prefer it, and I know people from Philly that take it both ways.

Papago Park is by far and away my favorite easy-level hike within 15 minutes drive (my criterion for most activities). It is a great retreat for those who are tired of looking at endless cactus and brownness. it is split into three main areas. There is the Lo Piano habitat and canal area which takes up the space north of Tempe Town Lake and the 202 freeway that has a beautiful riparian area (look it up) and well-kept trails through groves of Palo Verde, Oak, and Beech trees.   North of the canal (it's Hohokam and one of the oldest canals in the Valley btw) is the red rock hiking area for which Papago is known best. There are formations that have been carved out by the elements that you can explore, per say, by climbing to the top of one of the largest formations and stand in the window/hole that the park is famous for.  The north side of the park (accessible from Curry), is a regular park with large old trees, picnic areas, a small pond, a playground, and a large dog park area. I do not recommend entering the hiking area from this side (especially with your dog), as there is a lot of broken glass on the hillside (you can see it glimmer in the afternoon sun).  All in all, I would recommend this as a regular hiking spot for anyone living in the south Scottsdale or north Tempe areas.

Being on the lookout for gluten-free things since I "converted" last summer, I am still kicking myself for not knowing that Chompie's, a Tempe favorite and practically a historic landmark at this point, has a bakery which makes gluten-free cookies! But that's all they make. I Googled "gluten-free tempe, az" and came up with a website compilation of G/F places nearby. Chompie's was one of them, so I investigated.  I asked the kid behind the counter if they had gluten-free things, and he said yes. I asked what they had, and he pointed to a stack of unlabeled cookies in plastic containers. That was the first oddity--that they were unlabeled. G/F things should be labeled (for allergy purposes). The second was that was ALL they had, aside from a frozen hamburger bun (see Fry's frozen food department for better and cheaper buns). The ONLY good thing about the cookies were that it was $2.50 for 8 of them. They were mediocre at best. (again, see Fry's for better cookies). I am disappointed that there is no one in north Tempe/south Scottsdale/east Mesa that has cornered the gluten-free bakery market. Otherwise, I have to drive to south Tempe to get a decent cinnamon roll.

Three words: creamy poblano soup. Even if this place did not have a liquor license I would still drive all the way to Old Town just for the soup. It's seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten. I don't just throw that around, either. It's perfectly balanced and I crave it like I do sushi.  But thank the Lord it DOES have a liquor license, otherwise it would just be called "Tacos." They hand-squeeze fresh limes for every single margarita. It makes for sore hands and more work for the bartender, but it is certainly worth it. It is honestly the best margarita I have ever had (aside from my own homemade ones, of course). The best thing about it is it's $3.50 during happy hour (3-7pm everyday), and happy hour lasts ALL DAY on Sunday during football season. Pretty awesome. I'm pretty in love with this place.  Also on Tuesdays, tinga tacos (chicken) are $1.50 and shredded beef tacos are $1.00 (if I remember correctly, don't quote me on that). Regardless, they're cheap. Also some cheap $2-3 beer deals, but beer is the same everywhere unless you're at a brewery, so whatever about that.  All in all, I love this place. OPEN A TEMPE LOCATION PLEASETHANKS!

I have had Vietnamese may times, and this place is easily one of the best. Pho is a bit overrated for my taste (plus soup is not something I go out for), so I wanted to try something with noodles.  I'm gluten-free so I can't eat anything wheat-based, but I can have rice, potatoes, and corn. Their rice vermicelli noodles are so good. I got the #32 which is a combo of a spring roll, marinated pork, and shrimp on a bed of room-temperature noodles (sounds weird, tastes amazing) on another bed of shredded cucumber, lettuce, mint, and basil. It comes with aside of what I believe is a fish sauce, but does not taste like fish. It's more of a sweet and savory sauce. I really liked this place, and cannot wait to go back.

This is by far my favorite sushi restaurant I've been to yet. I'm sure there are considerably better places in the area, but I have yet to go there. The happy hour, however, is relatively non-existent. I strive for happy hours with sushi discounts, and sadly this is not one of those places. The drink specials on happy hour are pretty non-existent as well, so for me, the food better be damn good if I'm going to go there.   I'm OBSESSED with the Lotus Roll. It's 6 California Rolls arranged in a star pattern topped with baked lobster and smelt roe. Seriously incredible. I would recommend it to anyone who likes lobster. This is also the roll that introduced me to roe and I haven't been able to get enough of it since. This roll is particularly good with roe because the baked lobster is hot and warms up the roe so it's not so cold which can make it taste fishy. If you don't know what roe is, it's fish eggs. It sounds weird, I know. But please do not not get a roll because of it! The sushi chefs at Kabuki really know how to use it artfully.

This is my place. So much so that I fear they will soon engrave my name on the outside patio bar.   I love their happy hour, first of all. Incredible drink specials. $3 margaritas and half off all appetizers from 3-7 every day. I love this place.  There are four things you NEED to eat here before you die, in this order:  1. Bacon Won Tons - cream cheese won tons with bacon drizzled in maple chili sauce. In-credible.  2. Calamari - comes with a lemon aioli. Don't know what that is? It's a delicious mayonnaise-type sauce.  3. Queso dip - not your grandma's cheese whiz. Delicious white queso (no idea what kind, but obviously not from a can) with small slivers of a mild pepper in it. Delicious!  4. Southwest Chicken Egg Rolls - self-explanatory  This place is great and I don't usually say that about franchise/chain outfits.

I was so sad to find out that Tipp's 88 Thai restaurant at Dorsey and University was closed, so my quest for a new Thai place was on. I found this place through Yelp (like most restaurants), and was happy with my results. I'm also out to sample the massamun curry (cinnamon and clove-based curry with potatoes and onions) at each Thai restaurant in the area. Their's is by far the best I've had (as of yet). So rich and delicious with just the right amount of spices that you want.

I am a regular of this establishment. I have tried all the main yogurt places in the area (Yogurtini, Yogurtland, and Mojo) and this is by far the best overall. Although they do not consistently have my favorite flavor, peanut butter, my boyfriend says their tart/original yogurt is the best.   Topping selection is great, and they even have peanut butter sauce. I just wish they had more flavor choices.

I was really intrigued when my girlfriends told me about this place, and how it worked. First you get your cup and fill it with as much or as little frozen yogurt you want. They have all the normal flavors (chocolate, vanilla, etc.) plus some odd or seasonal ones like plain (tastes like unflavored yogurt; great with fruit or really sweet mix-ins) or fruit flavors like strawberry or pomegranate. Once you have your frozen yogurt, you walk over to a self-serve mix-in station where you can add in everything from pieces of chocolate candy, nuts, fruit, and even little Japanese mochi (which I would highly recommend adding). Once you are ready to check out, the cashier weighs your cup and you are charged based on that instead of cup size. This is one of two drawbacks I have found to this restaurant. I found that the pricing was not as definitive as I would have liked, as my half-full cup was $8+ after being weighed. I feel like if they went by size instead of weight prices would be much more reasonable. Also, there is barely any seating inside. I have been to both locations (this one and Mill Ave.) and noticed that there were 3-4 tables inside with 1-2 chairs at each. They could easily fit twice that many seats, and the empty space in the middle of the restaurant does not invite people in. Other than that, it is a great place for a delicious and healthy dessert.

I'm a huge fan of this place. This is one of my go-tos in the North Tempe area.   Happy Hour: Their happy hour is pretty good, getting a 4/5. They do 1/2 off all drinks and appetizers 4-7pm on weeknights. There are also pretty good daily specials such as Taco Tuesday and Pizza...Thursday? Regardless, their food is pretty good for the price and their bartenders do not skimp on the liquor in well drinks, regardless of whether it's happy hour. Thursdays beginning at 9 is buy one get one all well drinks, too.  The service is okay, but you can't be TOO expectant since they usually seem staffed pretty thin and the place is pretty much always busy. The staff is attentive, though, however infrequent they may be able to get to your table.  The ambience is awesome. They have leather armchairs at the bar and the entire place is done in wood and bookshelves. Its mostly a sports bar, but it's also a great college hangout spot. I've had some great nights here.  When it's cold, they have heaters out on the patio along with two fire pits in a seating area/lounge. They allow smoking outside on the patio too.

If you really want flavorless, salty broth with flavorless vegetables and meats, this is the place for you. For some reason, everyone I know and their mother loves this place. I honestly do not understand the appeal. If you have ever been to a place like Wagamama, you know there is a right way and a wrong way to do a noodle soup restaurant. This is the wrong way. First, every single soup I have ordered there (and I've been more than 3 times) tasted the same. I could not remember what I had the times before I went, they were that unmemorable. The misconception that this place is healthy also is kind humorous to me. I'm sure I'm getting my weekly value of sodium every time I go there.   I do have to mention, however, how great their squid salad, kimchee, and other small plates are. Whether they are from a jar or pre-prepared is another story, but regardless, they are good. The boba tea seems to be the thing to get here if you're not into ramen or just passing through. I'm not a connoisseur of boba teas so I will not pretend I know what I'm talking about with that, albeit I'm sure it's good.

If you know me at all, you know I love tequila and I love margaritas. Since turning 21, I have been on a mission to seek out and find the best tequila and margarita spots in the East Valley and Central Phoenix areas.  This place is the epitome of "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" as the 5 stars I gave this restaurant suggests. I am also a happy hour hound, and this place also gets 5 stars for that.  To begin, they have 100+ tequilas on the menu, all half off (except like 2) during happy hour. For $2 more, you can make any tequila on the menu a margarita (during HH, of course). They have blanco, joven, reposado, anejo, extra anejo, sotol, mezcal, and a couple other obscure agave-based liquors. They also have cheap beer if you're lame. (WHY DID YOU COME TO A TEQUILA BAR?!)  Anyway, their house margaritas are their only half-off drink during happy hour, but I'm not complaining. That's the only thing worth drinking there, unless you like your tequila straight in a sifter (my hero!).  4 of their 6 varieties of delicious street tacos are half off ($4) during happy hour along with their guacamole and salsa trio, both delicious choices. They also have a couple of appetizers half off that are pretty good, too.  WARNING: DO NOT GO HERE AFTER 10 PM  ......unless you want to see and partake in a complete and utter a sh*t show. The poor serving staff is way overloaded at night and it causes a ton of bad reviews for this place. It's really unfortunate, because during the day and early evenings this place is calm, relaxing and has wonderfully attentive and sociable service.

Not knowing much (or anything, really) about Peruvian food, going here was a completely new experience for me. I absolutely love yucca (potato-like plant eaten in Peru) and Inka Fest does it right. Since it has been awhile since I ate here, I do not recall the specific dishes. However, I do recall the Pisco Sour being absolutely delicious. It's made with pisco (liquor), lemon or lime juice, egg whites, and bitters. So delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try Peruvian food. I really enjoyed it.

Gotta love the literal "Mom and Pop" place, especially when it's something delicious like sushi. Prices are pretty good, and service was exceptional. Both the husband and wife (I'm assuming) who own the place were very attentive and friendly. I really enjoyed my meal.   The sushi was alright. I give it 3/5, 5 being Benihana and 1 being grocery store California rolls. Maybe it is because I got an eel roll and was not expecting it to be as fishy as it was, but in hindsight all eel rolls are very fishy, so that's more of a criticism of my own tastes than anything else.   Regardless, the sushi was fair and the drinks were well-poured. The owner was also very kind to us and took 20% off all of our bills instead of just one (because I only had one coupon). I miss the Thai place that used to be in this space, so I want to see a business succeed here. It is important to eat locally!

Alright, so I should preface this review with the fact that I read almost all the other reviews on here before going to this place as well as writing this review, so I had a few pre-conceived notions about what my experience was going to be like.  1. Games, games, games! This place is great if you enjoy console gaming from the classics (SNES) to the newer stuff like Wii U and XBone. As a mainly PC gamer, I spent my whole time there watching people play, but they had more or less anything you could want for consoles. THIS is what this place has going for it. THIS is why people come here rather than any other bar.  2. Drinks! Our bartender was a really cool person, and we sat at the bar. I was expecting to get ignored by the staff because that's what half the reviews I read said, but there were 2 staff members for every 1 customer in there so there was little chance of that (we went on a Thursday at 5pm). The bartender was friendly, let us try out a few beers and ciders they had on-tap and even made a mini beer cocktail for my boyfriend which he ended up ordering another of. They said they are revamping their cocktail menu to be less confusing so if you want a fancy cocktail, talk up the bartender and ask what they recommend for the time being.   3. Food? So I am a huge fan of throwing things in deep fryers. Always have. It's American. However, when every single thing on your menu minus three very simple salads is deep fried, it does not bode well for my next day experience (if you know what I mean). We ordered the Mac and Cheese bites which were pretty good but I think they need more flavor, like adding jalapeno bits or maybe even bacon (everyone loves bacon, and it's also very American). We also got the spinach and cheese rangoons which were about as expected: spinach dip crab puffs. These were pretty good. After those we were still hungry so we ordered a chili dog and fries. It was worrying that they had "ran out" of chili previously, which means they don't make it in-house. The fries had a strange smell/aftertaste that was vaguely chemical but it could have been anything from not changing the fry oil or just the way the fries come from wherever they are ordered from. I think this kitchen could do with some fresher, less obviously pre-made food items. I would really love to be able to come to this place for 3 hours in the evening and get dinner there while gaming but as of now I would not want to eat more than just some happy hour snacks here.  I gave this place 4 stars because it has an AMAZING concept and they pull-off the gaming bar aspect very, very well and I was impressed by the bartender and our drinking experience.  Suggestions for ownership/management: get better food, whether it's ordering it from a higher-quality food supply place or just asking your customers what they'd like to see on the menu... Also, please note that greasy food + game controllers = not very sanitary.
