Everything went better than expected!  We went here for lunch the other day after the original place we picked was too busy. By the looks of it I thought it would be a fast food style Mexican restaurant similar to el pollo loco or something like that so my expectations were not high. I was presently surprised.   Walking in there was lots of room but not very busy. The menu was well displayed. I went with the Achiote chicken salad which was quite good. I spiced it up a little with some salsa from their well equipped salsa bar. Although the salad was good I soon regretted my decision as I sampled my friend's baja fish tacos. I love fish tacos. I REALLY love fish tacos. If my life was a video game their would definitely be a side mission that entailed trying fish tacos at every restaurant in the game. Anyway, the fish tacos were delicious. Everything I could've hoped for. A very classic fried fish taco.   Now I can't stop thinking about fish tacos. Review over. I'm going to lunch.

I do love this bar, BUT a few months ago they changed the cheese that came with the pretzels and that is just not okay.

I mean, the ice cream was delicious and there are certainly a variety of flavors but what is up with all the questions. Is this an interrogation or and ice cream order. It's a banana split, that's what I want, a normal banana split. Ok sure, people like to be able to customize, I get that but it was a menu item. It could have at least been delivered better, like maybe ask all the questions as you take my order rather than intermittently throughout the banana split creation process or, even better, would be to ask (yep, I'm suggesting adding even another question) straight out do you want the standard toppings. I would've said yes, had a much more enjoyable banana split experience, and saved a lot of time ranting about it on the internet.  I don't know, maybe it's just that people bug me. But yeah. The banana split was exceptional.

Just the thought of eating Ticoz enchiladas gets me excited. Although a little pricey for lunch, the chicken enchiladas are so amazing I keep going back. The 2-dollar taco Tuesday special is a good deal. I usually just stick to the enchiladas through -  nothing beats them.   The ambience and service is great as well. We usually sit on the patio. There are cute little couches along the side and it's partially shaded. The inside is nice too, but I would recommend it as a good choice if you're looking to eat outside.

Great place. Their house shots are unique.  Lunch menu is good. And it's unusual to say a tuna sandwich is amazing, but it really was. You should try it. But the greatest thing is that the service is great!  And props to the new owner,(forgot his name),  who checked up on our meal. And props to the cool, pink arm-casted, bartender who played some really chill music.  Update: since we had such a great experience the first few times we kept coming back. Unfortunately, the subsequent times we went we did not have such a great experience. Between the bad music (random as fuck pandora stations), inexperienced bartenders(what's in a mojito), dead atmosphere, and expensive drinks I don't think We will be giving this place another chance to get back in our good graces.

Decent fish tacos. Ask for extra hot sauce, they use the tiniest cups ever.

All around good bar.  Lot's of bike parking and they have a  huge out door patio. It's not covered so is nice if you want to get some sun when the weather is nice. There are misters out there for when it's hot. They have a great selection of beer and I've liked every food item I've ordered. The staff is also great.    I recently started going to team trivia. It's a lot of fun. They start promptly at 630. Punctuality is not our strong suit so our group ends up trickling in during the first few questions but still a fun time. We do not win.   Couple things though I cannot forget to bring up but will not effect my rating.  1) Get that beer menu back on the chalkboard. Like seriously, it was amazingly useful. We all agree that it is a tragedy it is not there.  2) They don't have cherries.This practically made my friend cry. I do not support this.  **shout out to our awesome server last week Lauren. Great food recommendations as well!

Dog parks are really about the dog aren't they? So I'm gonna hand this one over to Brutus.    o0-wijwplw nxv wkwklnb  ms,.2.,ujk   Now that we've established my dog is absolutely adorable when typing on a computer I'll go ahead and translate that. He basically said, I love the dog park -I love going outside and playing with other dogs - exercise is good for dogs - I love running -my owner is awesome for taking me to the dog park- I love dog parks.

Everything I consumed was pure deliciousness.  I will probably have occasional day naps where I dream about my meal. We got the small beef kabob,  gyro combo, and hummus platter. I tried all of it and every item was great (even the rice).  The beef kabob also had a little spice too itn the perfect kick.  I will definitely be back. Yum yum in my tum tum!

Great nom noms in my tom toms. I got the gyro. It was loaded with meat and very delicious. Not like some places where the meat is dry and lacking in flavor.  One of the best gyros I've had. Added plus, its a small, locally owned business and the owners are quite friendly.

One of my favorite lunch places. It's within walking distance from my office and has great burgers for a good price. I usually get the bacon cheeseburger combo. For 5 bucks (including tax) you get a generously sized burger, fries and a can of soda. They even have mushroom burgers for my vegetarian lunch friends. The owner is very friendly and definitely makes you feel welcome. The only downside is the inside dining area is a little small (they also don't have alcohol so I guess there are two downsides). It seems to be hit or miss on the line- some days you might wait 10 minutes for the food but typically, it's out very quick. Love this place and it's especially good when you're low on cash and want a big meal. Highly recommend.

Great burritos. Good price. I usually go here for lunch but that is not to say the breakfast burritos aren't delicious. Added bonus: they have those little machines you put a quarter in and get a piece of jewelry. Now I have an awesome double heart ring that turns my finger green!

I wouldn't say there is anything particularly special about this froyo establishment but the boba topping option adds something a little unique I suppose.   The employees are friendly, the ingredients are fresh, and the hours are good.

This place is descent. There aren't many Chinese food places in the area and does it job when Chinese is on the mind. Although the ambience is far from delightful it makes a nice in and out place for take out on the way home and the service ,although lacking in the friendliness category, is quite fast. The first time I ordered here it did not make a memorable impression but while craving Chinese I gave it another shot, that and it's just so darn convenient. I have found something I like and stick to that, chicken and broccoli and crab Rangoon..  I've had better crab puffs butt I've also had worse, they are a little sweet but the ratio is perfect. The chicken and broccoli is a little to saucy but no bad enough to make me never come back and the broccoli is always cooked perfectly. Egg rolls are sub par. I don't even bother with them anymore.   Bottom line Decent take out, not bad enough to never go back but I will be far from loyal if another new decently priced place in the area opens up.

I've gone to various America's Taco Shop locations before and have never been that impressed. I'd say the same for this experience.   1st things, we ordered this for a school lunch meeting the other day. We put in the order the night before but no one ever saw it. It was packaged in a hurry and very difficult to distribute. We certainly wold not order it for a group event again.   That being said I went back today because I was craving tacos and could bike there in between classes. I was happy to see they gave me napkins in my to go order but that was about the only good thing.  The tacos were meh, as I had expected, but the worst things was this entire place smelled like a bathroom. So if you think America is a bathroom I guess the title is for you. I personally love America and do not care for this place.   I'd take a pass.

My pursuit of finding a reliable place I can always find the elusive powdered donut is complete. As my fellow powdered jelly donut afficiendos may know, they are not as commonplace as you might think. Well look no further, not only does Bosa have a plentiful stock but they are superb. The other donuts are good too, but that powdered jelly. #allaboutthatpowderedjelly.  The drive thru is 24 hours and I will admit,  on one late night donut quest, they only had one powdered jelly donut left. Sad for anyone who came after me, but I was first.

I picked this place using my usual method; imputing "fish tacos" into the Yelp Find bar and venturing to the closest place I haven't been too. I was pleasantly surprised. The hot sauce was amazing. I'm very glad I enjoyed the fish tacos but if I hadn't, I would've gone back just for the hot sauce.

Update: I went back here a few days later because I love fish tacos. I can confidently conclude,  after two visits, this place is great for more than just the tacos. The employees are so personable.  I got this vibe the first time I went as the customers and staff exchanged friendly banter while the staff diligently executed their taco making duties. But it wasn't just a fluke; the people that work here are awesome. It is definitely a business I want to support. They in exchange can support my frequent appetite for fish tacos. I may even go so far as to explore other menu options and diverse my taco experience.

When I worked in the area I would occasionally go here for lunch.Although I do eat some vegetarian foods, have not objection to a non-vegetarian meal and was a little leary the first time I went. But for realz. Shout out to the Black Jack Pita. It's super delicious and the texture is just amazing (something that can be a fatal downfall of vegetarian foods).  One of my other favorite foods is the hummus. I like to order it and put it in my tummus....  Anyway... If you have that one vegetarian person in the office let them have this one, it won't kill you eating one meat free lunch and it is not bad food. Just don't let them pick all the time, after all, we can't let the minority over step their bounds....

Food is great. I wish they'd throw in some rice and beans to fill out the meal.   I always get the green chile chicken enchiladas with habenero on top. They are quite delicious. There are also good vegetarian options available.   I also wish there was a good enchilada and soup combo meal.  It's more of a pick one entree either or kinda thing. I mean the name is enchiladas AND soup, not OR.    Also, the sneeze guard is awkwardly placed making it very difficult to hear the employees.  I guess I feel a little overly critical especially in light of the o so many positive reviews but  guess I can't help how I feel.   One more thing. TIP: make sure you get the sour cream on the side unless you want a big white pool of melted liquid sour cream engulfing your enchilada. The enchiladas are cooked in their plate leaving the plates very hot and they instantly transform a hearty clump of sour cream into liquid.  Update 7/29/2014: Seems as though they've worked out the kinks. There is still quite a bit of a lunch rush so If you are pressed for time it might not be the best place to go but otherwise it's worth the wait.

Me and my boyfriend are avid hummus fans and have thus made it our mission to try hummus at every restaurant we can. This place is freaking amazing. Everything is delicious and full of flavor.   Now, this place definitely has some inefficiency issues, especially when it comes to making the pita. There point of sale system is also kind of slow (and I have my suspicious about the staff).  This can be upsetting when getting to-go orders as it effects the temperature of the food. But this is my only complaint and will certainly not keep me from coming here.   Their set up is that of a chipotle style, they press the pita at the beginning (or at least that is the intention, if you get something with pita on the side, they wait until the end which slows down the process) and you pick your sides, meat, hummus and toppings. Everything ends up being kinda mixed together but is still good. I even liked the rice, which I don't typically like but I'm having suspicions that I just inherently like Mediterranean style rice.   *Gyro meat- great Falafel - pretty good  *potatoes - fantastic *Jalapeno/Cilantro hummus - amazeballs, very spicy *Classic hummus - Great ( I like it topped with onion, pickles and tomatoes) Rice - delicious Lemon-garlic hummus - a little spicy but pretty good chipotle hummus- pretty good *chili .. something sauce - spicy and delicious tzaiki - great  *favorite items   ***forgive spelling, since I'm writing this review in lieu of doing my homework, I'm not gonna take the extra time to look them up

We went here for a work lunch. I loved the vibe.   I had the chicken burrito. Its quite a different flavor but it was very delicious. We received unlimited chips and salsa before our food arrived. I mixed the salsa with the habenero chile sauce to make it spicier and it was delicious. I actually made the sauce too spicy but it was soo good I kept eating it.

So delicious. One of the best things about this place is that it's a very easy lunch spot to agree on. They have salads and pizzas and the ability to customize makes it so almost anyone can build a meal they enjoy.        This is an assembly line type place. There has been a line every time I've gone but it moves along quickly. The doughs are already ready on pans and you get to the front, tell them what sauce and cheese you want, they pass the pizza tray down and you add your toppings. Pizza goes in the oven and comes out super quick (I could guess an apprx wait time but I'm usually chatting away so it would probably be inaccurate).  The finished product is a personal sized, crispy, thin crust pizza. For those who are watching their carbs you can also get a salad, assembly works the same way minus the baking part. That would be weird.        The best thing about his is they do not charge for toppings so you can always expect to pay around 9 bucks... I retract... The best thing is the delicious food; the second best thing is the price.               My pick is a  pesto pizza topped with mozzarella cheese and tomatoes. If I'm feeling adventurous I may add some chicken. If you are reading reviews to try and figure out if you want to go here I highly recommend you stop contemplating, close your yelp app and experience life... by eating this pizza.   ***almost forgot. The restaurant also attracts a lunch crowd from the surrounding offices/business and there is not a lack of handsome well dressed men. I do not object to this.

The decor is nice but that's about the only thing this panda express has going for them. The staff is neutral-unfriendly, far from superior customer service. I've come here appx four times since they opened and have had to wait for the side I wanted each time. This time, I get here at 11, when the store is supposed to open, its been 20 minutes, all the sides are not out, and the steamed rice and mixed veggies are not prepared. To be honest, I will probably still come here because its close and there aren't a lot of other restaraunts in walking distance, but I'm ashamed.

Went here after work with some friends.  The staff was friendly and the drinks delicious.  There were a few hiccups with service but It was the grand opening and the issues were mainly due to technology problems. Hopefully they will get it worked out.    The meat and cheese platter was delicious.  I'm still thinking about it. We also got the smash chips which were quite enjoyable.    I'll definitely be back. Hopefully all the hiccups will be smoothed out and I can change my review to 5 stars.

Chairs are super amazingly comfy. They have controls on the side for reclining and you can put up the center arm for easy food sharing ( or, ya know, whatever else ;-) )  The seats are assigned which I thought was a little strange but I whatever.  Also, tons of fountain drink options and the refills are free ....SAY WHAT!  Conclusion : why would I go to another theater that charges the same just to sit in their crap chairs and get ripped off on my soda? Well, I wouldn't.

Wow. This place is open until 4am on the weekends and is right across the street from me. Seriously life changing. I chatted with the staff for a while. They were very friendly and thus I will not be adverse to coming back here.  This place is absolutely adorable inside. A drastic improvement from the last place that was there. It even looked clean... weird.  There are also some outdoor tables;. I can picture it now, me, my dog, and a pizza, sitting in the nice fall weather enjoying some delicious pizza in the sunlight. Or more likely, a nice study spot I can go to for a quick bite while my dog randomly barks at passerby.  As for the food, I didn't take to much of a risk here. I mean, it's right across the street from me and having a negative first experience would just be bad for everyone. They had a pretty diverse menu and I look forward to trying some of the Mediterranean items on my next visit. For this time, I went totally boring status and ordered a peperoni pizza and fried zucchini. The fried zucchini was up to standards, which is good, I don't expect anything different from my fried zucchini. The pizza was quite tasty. I'd eat it a lot. I mean, quite probably, I will eat it a lot.

Update: I mean, they have tried to improve. People say their coffee has gotten a little better. We were also very harsh on them when we first started the yelp. I'll award them an additional star but it is mostly out of pity.    Original review:  The customer service here is not that bad. The coffee on the other hand is lacking in quality. Actually, it's some of the worst coffee I've ever had. Some of the sandwich options are tolerable , but it's a coffee shop... and the coffee is awful. Also,  there is a fee to use your card if under 5 dollars. Pfft

The wait is finally over. A small sign said Thai Restaurant opening soon in a small strip mall in my neighborhood. Aside from this small tidbit of information (which indicated that a Thai restaurant was opening) I had no information but today I noticed the new sign which said OPEN! I immediately texted my friends and planned a dinner outing to take place promptly at 6:30 PM. We were not disappointing.   All of the food was very well presented and delicious. We started with some Thai Iced teas and coffees that were absolutely delicious. Then onto the house sampler which included Two veggie egg roles, chicken stay, fried shrimp rolls, crap puffs, shrimp tempura, and curry puffs. It came with three sauces, peanut sauce, sweet and sour, ... and some other thing that was also good. The hot sauce was extremely fiery and pleasing/burning. There were lots of vegetarian options which were great for the vegetarians in our group! Basically everything was great.   Although we were all skeptical if we could eat anymore we were seriously considering trying the Fried Banana with Ice Cream dessert. Then the wonderful news came; they were giving free desert. We split the fried banana desert that came with three scoops of ice cream, green tea, coconut and vanilla. In the midst of our excitement I forgot to take a picture but as we promptly devoured the tasty treat the opportunity was quickly lost. It too was delicious and I was quite pleased with a strong finish to our first visit to Smile Lao Thai. I will definitely be back and am excited to have a new dining option right in my neighborhood!
