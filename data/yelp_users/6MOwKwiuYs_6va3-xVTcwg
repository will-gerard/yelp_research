I've come here 2 days in a row for lunch! The fact I came back speaks for itself. Tempe has many choices, but this is now my go to Indian place.   I've always been a bit wary of buffets worried about quality, but the food here tastes totally fresh. All the items were loaded with flavor. The 1 star reviews without much substance frustrate me, because I believe this deserves a 5 star rating.   They seem to have some different options daily. The Mango chutney with the vegetable fritters was amazing. The service was subdued and polite as I would expect in Indian culture. I believe there may be room for a bit more proactive engagement. I think many people are unfamiliar with Indian cuisine, and that engagement could help those individuals feel more comfortable.   The decor is nice. There was definitely an effort made to give it a feel that I would call classy Indian.  Without hesitation I can say I will be back!

This was my first visit to Totts, and I was so impressed with the service at the counter. Honestly it was more inviting than most sit down experiences.

The cheese crisp is simply awesome! This truck is a must try in Phoenix metro whether you eat vegetarian or just like good food.

Originally we went in due to a positive yelp rating. Went for lunch on a Sunday. Both my girlfriend and I were very disappointed. Here is the story:  Downtown Scottsdale was super busy. There was hardly anywhere to park, yet we were the only ones in this place. We both felt uneasy walking in when we saw the place was empty, but decided to take the risk.   The place looks cool, and it might be fine for drinks at night. It has a New Orleans feel to it. However, the server was more focused on keeping the empty, already clean bar pristine than anything else. We had to initiate the greeting after waiting about a minute for her attention. During our stay another couple walked in, hung around for 30 seconds and left because no one acknowledged them.   There didn't seem to be any pride in the food. While the menu seemed okay, and the food appeared modern in its plating the taste was very bland. I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done. The veggies were definitely not sourced well, because they had nearly no flavor.   Amanda's Catfish po'boy was 1 color between the fish, the bread and even the veggies; Again, very dull in flavor. After leaving we discovered there was a happy hour that no one bothered to tell us about.   Shame on us for going into an empty place. We drove home feeling like we missed an opportunity. My guess is that this place has some investors, but no investment in a chef. If they did they would be hustling to get people in the door on a very busy Sunday instead of sweeping already clean floors.
