After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.  Went at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.  They started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?  We decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.  I thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill.   Overall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.

I know a lot of my friends really like this place, but I just can't get over the bad service and the food really isn't that great. It's really close to my house, so I go a lot to hang out and listen to the music that they have come through. Seriously though, I have stopped eating there because I realized after the 4th time that I have had "digestive issues" EVERY time I eat there. No joke.   When I did eat there, the food really wasn't that great. Usually a bite or two is good, then it just gets really gross. I've tried about every side item that they offer with there entree's and they are all pretty gross to me as well. The potato salad was the only thing that I actually thought was okay. And one time I went there and she listed off my choices for sides, I said "chips" her: "oh, we're actually out of chips" me: "soup" her: "we're out of that too now" me: "so really, what are my actual choices?" her: "salad".   Sorry to all my friends who like it, but it's really not that great. I think people come in and are charmed by the homey, inner-city art dive feel it has.

I like the idea of Zoes, but they just don't really execute it properly. Everything is pretty bland, and I think their only flavor profile is Feta cheese. Don't get me wrong, I like Feta...but on everything? I've been there 3 times, always hoping for the best, but I always end up having to load everything with salt and pepper to even taste it. It's overpriced for just getting a simple sandwich on store bought bread with a bag of potato chips.

Well...I'm super excited to be the first to review because I freaking love my dentist. How many of you can say that?   Super clean office, friendliest staff ever at the front desk, and dental hygienists are all nice and most cute. Not to mention Dr. Scott is one of the nicest people I have ever met. He's a good dentist too.   About 5 years ago one of my front teeth got chipped when my dog decided to bash his head into my teeth. I've had perfect teeth my whole life, and when that happened I was a poor, uninsured student that couldn't afford cosmetic dental work. 5 years later, I get insurance and during my first check up he says what a shame it is to have that chip...so he fixes it! He said there was some insurance work around and it cost me $0.00. You would never even know that my tooth was once chipped.   I love Dr. Scott and everyone else in this office, don't have a single complaint.

Three words: Best Mocha Ever. Oh, and five more words: Best Peanut Butter Brownie Ever. Now that we know I like Lux, let's talk about some peoples complaints.  Those who know me know I'm not trendy or a "hipster", but I've never had anyone at Lux "scoff" at my Target clothes or un-trendy shoes. And for the most part, everyone I know who goes to Lux really does work while they're there...they aren't just pretending to be on their computer! And if they aren't working, it's probably because the internet is down (which happens a lot more than it should at Lux).   Overall, I really like this place but I can see how one who isn't super trendy or artsy might be intimidated when they first show up. My advice is to go again, a lot of different types of people go there and are really friendly. Plus, the different groups of people will come in cycles...at a certain time it might be inundated with twenty-something hippies with dreads, and another time it might be taken over by 30-something slightly overweight workaholics.   Don't let people scare you from a good place.

Even though they don't serve Sake, they do a great job as a bring your own place. The location is small, so if you have a large group you might have to wait a little while to be seated. It's definitely worth it though.   As I look at the reviews of other Yelpers, I can't help but think that they're just ordering the wrong things. I mean, good sushi is about good fish. It really kind of bothers me when people say "I love sushi" and then either pick the fish off the roll, order something without fish entirely, or order something that's going to be drenched in some American sauce.   The waiters have always been really knowledgeable and educated about the flavor profiles of their fish and are usually really good about letting you know what is going to be best that day and what is the freshest.   I have yet to find a sushi place in Phoenix that has fish as good as theirs, it's not the best, but it's the best I've had in the valley. And, I don't know what Jenn H. (review below) ordered to get something covered in mayo? We always get a variety of different things and I have yet to have anything with any weird sauce on it.  I mean, I've probably been there 5 or 6 times, and I can't remember any sauce on anything. When my dad and stepmom came to visit from L.A., they liked this place so much that they actually wanted to go two nights in a row.

Think In-N-Out burger on steroids before it became a chain. That's this place. I officially 'heart' Lucky Boy Burger Shop.   I really can't imagine anything bad to say about the food, prices, or service at Lucky Boy. Some people might be offended by the location or the decor, they definitely didn't splurg on interior design. But, it's part of the charm and it keeps prices low. Where else can you get a 1 lb burger and fried mushrooms for less than $5?   I just wish they were open on Sundays.

I had no idea this place existed even though I've driven past it a ton of times. It didn't really catch my attention. When my husband suggested we go there, I said "Huh? Where?" Been there once, definitely crave it again.  The carne asada burrito was delicious, and it was the perfect serving size. I was able to eat it all but I wasn't left hungry or unsatisfied either. They could definitely use some help in the service/usability department though. When I first walked in, I had no idea where the menu was (it's written in chalk on the walls in very large print...so large I didn't even think to look at it as a menu).   Mmmm...I want a burrito now.

"Meh" is exactly right for this place. After reading all the 4-5 star reviews on opening night, I was really excited to finally have a sushi place downtown. Needless to say, I was very underwhelmed by the whole experience.   Miso soup was sub-par at best. You'll get much better Miso at Hana (7th Ave & Missouri) or Yasu (near PV mall). Miso is my favorite part of the whole sushi experience, and they did just about everything wrong with it.   Prices were what you would expect for good sushi, but definitely over-priced for the quality that was served here.   Good sushi is about fresh fish, so my husband and I like to ask the chef's for their recommendation for the night. The chef here sent us out toro (it's the fatty part of the tuna, good toro is like biting through butter) which also happened to be the most expensive fish they had. I couldn't even chew through this toro, if this was the freshest fish they had then I am seriously concerned about the quality of their fish. It was like chewing a tough piece of steak and very unpleasant.   The chef came out to ask us if we liked the toro, and when we told him it wasn't good he got very offended and insulted us (basically said that it was because we couldn't tell good fish from bad fish).   Wait staff was also slow (we were the only people there) and didn't know anything about their menu or sushi. Chairs were uncomfortable (they were wire frames, kinda like shopping carts). Tables were too small (every plate and glass on our table was literally touching everything else b/c there was no room).   I could go on and on with the things they did wrong...but I think you get the idea.
