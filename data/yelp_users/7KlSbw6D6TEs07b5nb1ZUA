Love love this place! I grew up in Salt Lake and they are all over, sad that there is only one here in AZ but I do make the drive! I love the pork burrito and the queso is amazing!

Great mani/pedi spot! I have been hooked to their shellac and they do an amazing job. I don't live close to them anymore but they are worth the drive. Shawn and all the staff is lovely!

Cannot go wrong at this salon! I get my hair done by the fabulous Chelsea and recently I have found another hair gem there names Jessica. I get spray tans, massages, facials and my pedi's here! Also i have just converted to their DoCo foundation, it's awesome. Keep up the good work Dolce!!

The views from the patio are amazing! We came here for brunch and the food was great! I especially loved the bread basket! Service was great with no complaints!

Sorry but a one star is all this place deserves. Overall was not a good experience. Sad to walk out of a place paying for services that you would have rather done yourself. Worst blow out I have ever had, who lets someone leave the salon with partially wet hair??

Oh Ann why did it take this long for you to come into my life??! I was told about Phoenix Glow by a friend and thought nothing of it. Fast forward to the best spray tan of my life, good bye spray tan booths! Ann is amazing at making you feel comfortable and knowing exactly what would look good for your skin. Never have I had so many compliments on my tan, I cannot wait to come back!  Thanks Ann!!

Where do I begin?! I was able to stumble upon Chelsea after moving to Arizona. We all know how scary it is to move to a new place and leave an amazing hair stylist behind. Well Chelsea has replaced that hair void in my life! I cannot say enough great things about her and the work that she does. I truly enjoying my appointments and look forward to the time that I get to spend with her. I highly recommend Chelsea!!
