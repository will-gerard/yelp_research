There is a lot of pretty good Meixcan food.  Other wise I would have given it one stars.  The service 9 out of 10 times is not good.  In fact  I have been there and gotten an attitude more than once. My main complaint is this place closing early.  Today they closed early for Easter.  One hour early I think is a pretty bad excuse.   If this was the first time I went all the way over there and they closed early that would be one thing but this is the second time this has happened.  Think I have eatten there for the last time.

I really love this place but tonight not just the salsa but also the hot sauce was sour. Maybe it was because of xmas I assume theu closed. We asked for the manager and he brought out fresh salsa that was also sour. I cant think of any reason that would be acceptable. I know for a fact this placw jas a clean kitchen but maybe they need to revisit the inventory and product rotation. We got 10 percent off. But so me one please give me a reason why I should go back? Thank fully I did not get sick. Also let me add I love their crispy chicken tacos.  Tonight is just wasnt good.  Let me add that I have provably ate 100 of them over The last 15 years.

I'm going with 2 stars because I like the biscuit.  And the service was good.  But I feel like I just ate a 20 dollar plate of McDonald's. Meaning how many chemicals did I consume over the course of the meal.  It could be my nutty mind but that's how I felt.  And I don't remember reading or seeing Ads claiming the food is healthy or all natural.

Terrible service at night Aug 16. Usually the service is great.  But thanks Jersey Shore dude for ignoring us and not checking on how the piZza Was. It was raw.  And thanks for cooking it more and not bothering to making a fresh one.  And thanks for not checking if it was better the second time.  And the manager who we flagged down to fix it.  Thanks for not chomping the meal. You served raw dough pizza.   In his defense he at least got the order right.  And this place usually has great service and very good food. But thats pathetic serving raw pizza. Get it together.   I wish I refuse to pay and wish I stiffed the server. Enjoy your one star review. And guess what I won't be back.

I am from jersey and I can tell you the calzone I just ate was as good as the pizza place ramonos by my childhood home. Honestly this was my second trip here and I don't remember what got last time. I don't remember being impressed. But today was awesome. Ny style calzone. Ill go back and report back on the pizza.  I didn't think the water in az was right for real ny style.  But I was wrong. If you want ny calzone run don't walk to this place. Outstanding. probably then best diet coke and calzone in Arizona.  they are moving down the street to quadalupe in may.

Drinking water cause they got the pepsi.  Food came out uncooked,  slow service. Server tried to tell me thats how it is.  really you serve mexican food with cheese that isn't melted?  No visit from a manager or anything. this is a place in need of a visit from restaurant impossible.  I won't be going back.

I'm going to be honest here.  This is my third terrible experience this week eatting out. And this is one of my FAVORITE places. Its one of the few great locally owned restaurants that has diet coke. The baked spag and pizza muffins are amazing. 2 of my all time favorite foods that I can only get here.    But I feel the need to report a problem.  This is the second time this has happened sour cucumbers in the salad. I know I'm a pain in the ass  because I always ask for extra.  And the service is great in this place. One of the best in the city. But this is the second time this has happened.  Once I can understand but twice.  There is simply no excuse.  And too top it off tonight our eggplant was raw. I know it was busy and accidents happen but the cucumber thing really angers me its gonna be a long time until I go back.   I feel very guilty giving this place one star but I'm upset.

Thanks for serving me rotten artichoke.  Thanks for not chomping the meal.  This place is either great or horrible.  It could possibly be most inconsistent restaurant I have ever gone too.  The manager comes over and apologies but doesn't comp the meal. And doesnt assure me it will never happen again.  I believe he said I checked and didnt see any more rotten ones.  No kidding they are not all rotten.  Rotate your food to ensure its always fresh.  Restarant 101. Obviously I have to continue to expext more of the same.

Attaching picture. Cut was not even and there is a black edge on the bagel. The amount of cream cheese is extremely tiny. Would it kill them to put more than a tiny thin layer of creamcheese on the bagel. And cut it down the center straight. What else does a bagel place really have to do

what can I say besides this is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  Authentic New Mexican food. I get the#1 combo and I try to not eat it all so I have room for the sopapia.  Only complaint is they serve pepsi.

One word YUMMY.  loved the rice and beans tasted home made.  Great service.  They even have diet coke.  CarnAsada tacos very good.  nice and fresh. The salsa and chips comes if you order dinner.  Really good slightly salty but it is mexican food.  They brought out green and red hot sauce for the tacos.  Which excited me but neither of them had anything amazing.  But I like spicy and it was mild.  Not saying bad just that I expected them to knock my shoes off because everything else about this place did. I have a feeling there are a few other menu items to try that would make me want to give them 5 stars.

I love this place but the ac is broken and my icy cream was melted by the time I got out the door.  No joke more of it on my hands than my mouth. Sucks its hot in az and the ac broke but they shouldn't have been selling ice cream.  I just feel bad for the employees working in that heat

Noticed a few reviews complaining about cold French onion soup so I brought that up with the Waiter he assured me it would be hot so I tried it off course it came out cold.  Didnt think the flavor was to good.  Ordered chicken salad  sandwich and it was whole wheet croissant. Why would some want a healthy croissant that makes no sense and why would the menu not explain that.

I always thought this was kind of a Hawain place and I love that kind of thing but every time I went I ended up at the sushi happy hour.  I like sushi but it's not my favorite.  Anyway this weekend we went for diner and had some of the entrees.  Simply outstanding.  I'm like wow.  And I'm very picky. I had some Cajun dish but it was with seafood.  Which I loved. So I would recommend giving this place another try like I did and try something off the menu instead of the happy hour.

As you know from reading my other reviews. Im a picky mofo. And not much of a meat eater. But I do like prime rib. So when I saw this was the specialty I rushed right over. It was great. Cooked perfect. Loved the twice baked pot. Server was sweet and recommended a nice wine. Bread very fresh. Manager even checked on us. I always appreciate that. A really great experience.

I'm from NY and the quest for good pizza in AZ has been a mission I have always lost. But maybe the solution is Chicago style.  I have to be honest I really loved the pizza I had yesterday so much so I'm having trouble resisting going again today.  I found the service a little annoying. Not to say it was bad.  The pizza didn't take very long like it does for deep dish at Oregons.  What I liked the best was it wasn't greasy.  And it really did have a nice flavor compared to the junk pizza I normally eat in AZ.

My bad luck continues they burned our buritos.  And the guy across has burned food too I'm watching the cowboy eat it burned. And the cook gave me a mean look. Why send out bruned food.  I love this place. The bean burittos are great but you have to wonder if they are that careless is the food sanitary

Hongkong shrimp medium spicy was probably my favorite chinese meal I have had in a very long time. I like this place. Everything is clean and the food is very fresh.  Even the diet coke was tasty. They just do things right. A real gem.  Counter service but the food comes out fast. Always very hot. Try this place you will be happy you did

I'm disappointed.  I  saw this place on a top 10 best in the country list. It's more French than mexican. When you sir down yoy get bread and something that looks like olive paste.  I loved the spread but the bread was slightly stale. But eatable.  I was in the more for chips so u got guac it said award winning. It was more of a avocado salad.  Are you staying to see a grand.  But I did like the guacamole it was different with cran raisins.  I ordered carne tacos because the chillrenno sauces scared me.  The meat was high end trays like a roast. Not like asada. The problem wad it was very beefy. I have to say it was gross I should have sent it back.  I know what your thinking beef is beefy. But this was bad. If you want new types of recipes and don't mind paying twenty dollars plate fire a dumpy place with white table clothes go try. There is a lot to like about this place

I want to like this place. But the stromboli aka calzone had no flavor. I think what I dont like is the sauce. It had a weird flavor to it. The gf said too much basil but that was not it.  The fresh bread was wonderful. They have a very cool patio. I will have to try again something different. But I thought the stromboli was terrible. Kind of soggy after the water drained all over the bottom of the plate.  Why it has water is curious. I should have got a pizza I guesss. But the sauce scares me. Next time I will try homemade pasta.

This place is amazing.  Great service.  Love how the manager always checks on you.  They have a few things that rock my world.  I recommend trying.  Mac and cheeseis the best I have had.  The baked potatoe is the best I have had.  I know it seems weird to pick or rate a place for that but I love them.  I also love the fresh baked bread.  Ten times better than cheese cake factory. We had a Ribeye last night that simply rocked my world.  Two things I don't like but are popular the spinach and the medallions.  I recommend going for the filet instead.  Best restarant by fashion square mall.  You have to try it

I have a few issues with tonights meal. First I wish on sat night when I'm taking out the girl, they would get it right. Also this particular outback has consistently been terrible. I honest love outback and the manager was nice about things and comped the meal. But I didn't get the impression they are going to fix the issues. Or even capible of fixing things. Service was slow. Not terrible just subpare to start with. Salad had almost no dressing.  Soda was very good and bread was fresh. The baked patato was obviously in a steamer for at least four hours. That's just wrong. Can I please have a fresh one with my steak. The crab was the worst I have ever eatten.  The crab was dried out. My steak was so dry I almost chocked on it. I had beef jerky that was more tender. My girlfriend ordered her steak med well and it came out rare. This is the problem. We finally chased down the server who was not good about checking on the food and he had it cooked properly.  You got a second chance do it right?  No it tasted like they cleaned the grill with grill cleaner and scrapped all the old junk off the grill and then recooked it on there. That's just wrong. I felt like it was my fault for not ordering a rare steak.  Seriously I'm not sure how they could have made the meal any worse.  Shame on you.

I'm being grumpy because I have had far worse food. I drank water that tasted like my swimming pool. Chips obviously not fresh. Salsa tasted like canned tomatoes.  my Chili renno was not bad. Rice and beans not bad. Overall I enjoyed the meal. But for Arizona this place is lame. Also server had the personality of a cartel thug

Birthday signup we got the $30 gift card and went over mid week.  Another one of my favorite places.  The service was terrible.  The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours.  I don't think it's supposed to take that long.  I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help.  Nothing changed.  I don't think the manager cared because I didn't see him helping.   But the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems.  The cook who I think was also new.  And it could have been the server. But he didn't make enough.  And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person.  Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday.  And I think the first person took a taste of it.  Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there wasn't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl.  Pretty sad I had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade.

I love it. Always fresh. Food always great unlike paradise bakery. And they have diet coke. My only issies if they read this. A small beverage is way too small. Its annoying to get a refill every third sip. Im cheap sorry. The internet is free wifi bit but almost never works.  And the counter people could be better. More than once I have stood there for a few minutes before someone came over. They never seem to be knowlegable about the menu.

I see my old review referenced eggplant parm with tough skin. I do love the calzone here. But what I hate is old pizza slices. To me it was worse than frozen pizza. I'm mad at my self for not sending it back. I lied to the guy when he asked me when I was leaving sad it was good. I will never go back. Enjoy your Caffeine free diet coke I won't drink that again

I love this brand but this particular location is terrible.  Todau I had a mango smoothy that had hard things in it. I can only hope it was from a mango pit. The blenders are so load I couldnt place an order.  I had to repeat my order three tomes between blender cycles. And this isnt the first bad experience I have had at this location. The francjise o wner should take a little pride in ownership is my suggestion. Hire some employees wh o arent miserable everytime I go in there.

Not yelping the food cause its panda express. Everyone knows what the food is. Ot would ne like a nogmac review. There is no need to review the food.  but the girlfriend is very mad because the lady behind the counter was rude then screwed up her order. and then had an attitude when I tried to get it corrected. then the people after us had to wait. no hi welcome or anything like that. then she proceeds to screw up that order as well. god thing its counter servi ce. then the drive in window clerk has to correct her also.  I really have never seen anything like this. if you cant hear customers im sure there are easier jobs that pay the same.

I have a lot issues with this place. I want to like it. Prob good as a bar.  The food concept interesting obviously why it was on ddd. But no excuse to have cold sliders. And three dollars for an 8 ounce diet coke that was warm. After waiting half hour for the food I obviously drank it all.  I could go on. They need to work on how the place is run.  Also no ac its basically outside so avoid in summer. I'll leave my complaints here I don't want to be too harsh I just didn't enjoy my experience at all.

Asked for glazed they are out. So I get apple. Walk out and notice they gave bear claw. So I go in as they bring out glazed. Really you didn't know the glazed was coming in 60 seconds.  And just rude. Why be in service business and give customers attitude. I will say the donuts are fresh but I say this all the time if you just don't care how sanitary is the food your serving.

Gotta leave another review. I like this place. This time I ordered clam sauce trying to avoid meat.  Had 2 small clams. I searched and searched.  Taste bad. Not sure how its made but tasted like it came out bag with processed or powered mix.  Sent it back got my fav meatballs. That tasted great. But as soon as I walked in the door I had upset belly and ran for the bathroom.  Who knows what causes that but it seemed like strange occurance so soon after the meal. Draw you own conclusions

I ate at the one in austin a million times and it was always great.  But this was my second time to this location and I'm not going back.  Burned pizza is not acceptable. Flat soda sucks. And server not checking to be sure everything is ok just makes me mad. So I had to post on yelp. Maybe they can fix this place should be great.

while I have had worse pizza I really disliked my pizza. almost no cheese. the wood fired oven burns parts of the pizza.  good if you like extra crispy pizza. I do not. it was more like cardboard. and burning pizza doesnt help keeping it from tasting like cardboard.  I looked at the table next to us and the one behind and their pizza was burned also. then I remember seeing the place on the morning news and it coming out burned and I said remind me not to go there. so my mistake I went to try it.  why this place is on national best pizza lists confuses me. I have had pizza in ten places in nyc that are far better. I am guessing they use real moz.  but most of the pizza had no cheese. so yeah im very disapoointed. my budy warned me that it wasnt that great. and I posted this on facebook asking. no one I know likes this place. so do not be fooled by it making best of lists. and the service. never came back to ask how the food was. so I didnt bother telling them it burned.  they have soda bottles like mexico.and today out of diet coke. What kinda pizzeria doesnt have a soda fountain. the one meal that soda really is required along with mexican. and the old chair I was sitting in was rock hard. the problem was that it wobbled.  terrible restaunt. avoid it please. dont say I didnt warn you

The guy in front of me had a coupon for a sampler which isn't on the menu. You need coupon to get that. Not sure why the ratings are so low. I like this place.

As some who grew up in NY. I take it as an insult to call this NY style. Its little caeser style. That being said its not bad for generic run of the mill Arizona pizza.I use the word generic because I saw it in someone else's review. In NY almost no pizzarea would serve Pepsi.  I have had far worse pizza in az just never worse in jersey. Let me say its much better than little Caesars its just not NY style. They put parm on the crust so that alone should prove the point. I really didn't enjoy my meal. I feel bad because they were nice and the food isn't uneatable its just not for me

The gf likes to take me here because she says I'm a little piggy. I guess that's better than being a big piggy. But truth is this is one of phx best eating establishments. Think French class and care but in a BBQ joint. The quality and freshness of the food is simply amazing. Everything about this place is wonderful from the host at the door who is always sweet to the music to the diet coke. One of my favorite foods is apply crisp. They have some amazing desert save room

This place is like I designed it as my own restaurant.  Cool beachy theme. The sweetest servers in Scottsdale. Not just one server helps you they all make sure you get good service.  The food is cool too.  Burgers with hatch peppers my personal favorite.  And then sweet potato tatortots.  Who ever thought of something so cool.  And too top it off home made fresh pretzel rolls for your burger.  Now all I need is a banana shake.  Which they probably have with rum. I just didn't ask. They have dietcoke which is hard to find is most phoenix restaurants so I just had one of those. Which I think they filled twenty times.

My chicken tasted raw. It didn't look pink . I kept trying to strain my eyes to be sure. And the rice was also kind of cruncky like it wasn't finished cooking. Someone train the new guy how to do it properly cause it had been fine in the past. Internet worked good enough for me to leave this review.

I went to the website first to  contact them and wasn't going to yelp them.  I live close by and have been here a few times.  Every single time something is messed up.  My honest opinion is that its the management.  They need to train their employees.  Some things are not common sense.  For example during todays breakfast the waitress think her name is Michelle came over and asked the girlfriend if she wanted a refill.  Because she had basically been slow the entire meal I asked for one also mine was half full.  On the way to fill it up she stops and takes an order.  Setting out drinking on a resting table.  Common sense is that when I'm eating my meal I want to have a beverage at the same time.  And I do not want to wait for you to take an order from silver hairs which predictably  took a long time to place the order so I got up and took my drink back.  No apology.  No recognition that a mistake had been made.  Maybe she didn't realize that is not the proper way to serve a table.  Tip.  When someone flags you down while you are doing a refill tell them you just have to refill the drink and you will be right back.  So maybe things aren't common sense like when you serve potatoes.  You can't mix two batches together.  One that is crispy and another one that is raw.  You actually want to try to have your food come out consistent.  They should always be cooked the same.  Customers are not very crazy about having a few raw potatoes in every bite.  This is not the first time I have had issues at this place.  It is a cute place and they do have the best Jelly I have ever had ever. So at some point in time some one knew what they where doing.  But maybe when they setup shop in Arizona they sent out someone who was not qualified to train and open new restaurants.  I would like to believe if you go to Oregon they operate better.  I wish I could remember what some of the previous issues were. But I know it has been 6 months and mistake I tried it again.  Thing is if they cared about doing things properly they would have feedback forms in the restaurant.  And maybe a way on the website to send a message.  I'm not going to send snail mail to the corporate office to complain.  So hopefully they read this review get better management and train their employees cooks and servers.  This could be a great restaurant with a little care and TLC.  So you are warned. It's a roll of the dice if you will have a good or bad experience.

This place is great. I coyly I'm not the only one who lives it because it's busy.  I was getting tacos and the girl there told me about this place she was craving it.  So the word is spreading.  So why did I deduct a star.  Dirty tables.  Not one table was clean.  Soda machine broken.  All the tea s empty.  The employees are sweet but very carefree.  They are yapping behind the counter having a good time while things are going Un done. Even in a counter place it would be nice if someone went around and checked on things.  Would it hurt for the manager to ask every table how the meal is?  But if you want healthy fresh tummy did.   Try this place.  I had bowl with brown rice and shrimp.  It was so good.  Grilled vegis cooked perfect.  I even likes the brown rice

I'm not a fan I'm trying to figure or what I didnt like.  Could be the quality of the ingredients. Maybe not the freshest. Like chipolte it tasted very salty.  I think I prefer chipolte.  I had a beef burrito. Maybe I like fresh carne asada.  Even filbertos has better flavor beef. The diet coke was very good.  I hated the hot salsa.

I hate to give you guys such a low score cause the food is fresh. Service was good. But I just don't like your tacos. Guess I like simpler flavors. I don't get the salsa. At first I was excited to have 4 kinds. Two kinds tasted like tabaco. The corn on the cob was interesting. I didnt love the sauces on it but I didnt enjoy the corn.  Now on the other hand if you like gastro pubs this place is cool. If you want tacos not great. If you want an adult beverage this is a very good place to hang. Sorry for the low stars. Cool bar. Not great for tacos.  Some I am sure will disagree with my review. I recommend trying for you self.

I thought both the chili plate and beef fajitas had little flavor. Salsa and diet coke was great. Guess I expect more chili when I order a chili plate. I thoight it tasted dry. Beef fajita had a very strong beef flavor not ideal. I ate here year ago when they first opened and I remember liking it. Note to self always yelp picture so I remember what to order

I'm torn on 4 stars but the employees are so nice so I'm gonna give them 4.  I had a carne asada ques.  It was great.  My problem is it comes with green stuff which I hate.  And like others have said  it was extremely tiny. Like mini appetizer.  So yeah this is the most expensive fast food I ever had. Two mini things and a drink is gonna run about $15.  They gave me a taste of the pastor.  Its not my thing but I'm sure some will love it.  Quality food here. Fresh and clean.  You get what you pay for. I just wish the menu was more clear on the sizes.  Just know it's going to be expensive if you are hungry.  My quesadilla was the size of a street taco to give you an idea.

Good simple fresh. Not ny style. Be careful cause it looks wood fired and that tends to make very crispy pizza. I asked to make mine not too crispy. Comes o ut qu I c k.  Worth a try

I have to admit in general I tend to not love brick oven pizza. I like my pizza ny style. But this place is great.  Basically its subway but for pizza. Same processes. Thry make you a personal pizza as you watch. Pizza artists. Really good quality. They are always extremely n ice. The place is always clean. If you love pizza like me you have to try this place. The diet coke is great. But I also like the free brew green ice tea. I always ask the guy to not make my pizza crispy.  They smile and hook you up. Pizza how ever you want it.

Pretty sad. I can honestly say this is top ten worst burger joint I have been to. The bread stale. Fries are tiny shoe string greaseballs. Burger grease is unbarable. Banana milk shake is awefull just artificial flavoring.

They put way to much dressing on my sandwich.  I tried rating it. Tried removing it but it didn't work. So the girlfriend went up and asked them to make a new sandwich.  I asked the guy should i toss my sandwich he says yes.  Then he tries to charge me for a new sandwich.  Why would i pay for a sandwich th ey messed up.  Why would you drench a sandwich in dressing.  The bread was soggy.  All i taste is dressing.  Guess i go to subway for now on

Outstanding. You can pick you own blend for less than five dollats. And they juice it fresh. No wonder the line is longer than chipolte. One of my favorite joints of all time.
