I brought my cat here for a second opinion after treating her for a persistent eye infection through a different vet.  Dr. Grant was immediately able to provide a diagnosis and treatment plan that was correct, effective, and affordable.  You can tell as soon as you walk in the door they love cats here and it truly is much less stressful for cats without the dog riffraff roaming about.  I love the doctors, the staff, the whole place - and I would highly recommend it to anyone searching for the "right" vet for their cat.  They truly care about their patients and their owners and will always do their best to take care of you quickly, fairly and kindly.

Very weird service.  Good soups.  Terrible pad thai.  Delicious sticky rice with mangos.  Consistency is definitely a problem here.  Eccentricity is not.

All I have to say is order the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish.  It's mindblowingly delicious.  It literally melts in your mouth.  Also, the service is polite, knowledgeable and friendly.  I really like this place for something different.  It's fusion done right.

Simple hole in the wall place.  We ordered Bibimbap, Fried Dumpings and Tofu & KimChi Soup.  Soup was hands down the best part.  Served in a stone cauldron - bubbling hot and spicy with a fresh egg cracked into it table-side.  Fantastic!

Incompetent and rude staff.  They make you wait 5 minutes just to take your order (without even acknowledging your presence).  Then they make your bagel wrong.  The last thing anyone who orders an everything bagel with chive cream cheese is an everything bagel with honey almond cream cheese.  Gross.  They argue with you that the incorrectly made bagel is correct.  They make you wait longer for the new one.  They do not even offer the common courtesy of a simple apology for wasting your time.  That was my first experience.  The second experience, I asked for my bagel to be toasted twice.  I saw the girl toast it once.  When I asked whether she toasted it twice, she yelled the toaster is broken-I can't toast it twice.  What?  Why is it my problem the toaster is broken?  And she had not toasted it twice.  The gentleman in front of me advised me to leave if I had not already paid because he had been waiting 20 minutes for 3 bagels.  These people should not be working with the public and even worse, probably could not answer - what is 2+2.  There is nothing complicated about toasting a bagel and treating customers with common courtesy.  This comes from someone who spent 10 years working in the restaurant industry.

Last time I went it was lunchtime on a weekday.  Our server was very quick and attentive.  The sushi lunch deal was *amazing.*  Piping hot miso, delicate seaweed salad, crisp cucumber salad, flavorful sauteed veggies, fresh orange slices and the main attraction - tuna, yellowtail and salmon all absolutely fresh and perfectly prepared.  I left totally stuffed and happy.  One caveat - they should turn down the music a little during lunch; happy hour should be one level of noise and lunch should be several octaves below that.

I'm surprised this place got such mixed reviews.  I went and all the food we ate was dee-lish.  We took the advice of our wonderful server, Jill (definitely ask for her - she's great!).  She recommended Fire Rock Pale Ale, the Spicy Ahi Tempura Roll, Jewelled Beef Noodles and the Surf and Turf with Vegetable Fried Rice.  Everything was perfectly spiced and sauced; the beef was very tender and veggies were fresh.  It can be a little pricey, but check out their daily specials.  I'll definitely pop in here again!

This place is great!  Guacamole is fresh and tasty, tortillas are warm and soft - they even have horchatas - and its totally affordable.  WAY better (and more authentic) than Baja Fresh and other such chains.  Very friendly service.  Next time I want to try the chiles rellenos.

Deplorable really.  The food made me sick.  I would rather have Taco Bell.

I almost hate to tell anyone about this because I want it all to myself.  The owner is a food artist.  The ingredients are of the utmost quality and the way they are paired is totally elegant.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  Try the Kensington pizza.  A white pizza with goat cheese, figs,arugula - add prosciutto - and you have it all.  Sweet, spicy, creamy, salty, bitter, chewy - really phenomenal.  They have Zucchini Cakes!  They have adult milkshakes!  They have great service!  They have a cool interior!  Better than Pizzeria Bianco.  There I said it.

Listen - a lot of the pastas are homemade and even the ones that are not are perfectly cooked and the sauces are savory and delicious.  The bread is light and chewy at the same time and served with olive oil.  Salads are fresh and perfectly dressed.  Ambiance is very nice - mellow music, tasteful art.  Service is impeccable.  Only regret I had was not saving room for dessert.  We'll definitely be back.
