Their drum sticks are WAY over priced here. Obviously this place relies on music lessons as a huge part of their business. I had to stop by to grab sticks in a pinch, and I will never make that mistake again. $16.99 for a pair of Promark 5B's!! Amazon has them for $10.  UPDATE: After seeing my post, one of the owners Bruce B messaged me to tell me that they would like to give me a free pair of sticks because they wanted to take care of me their customer. Instead of ignoring my post, or getting upset they went above and beyond to remedy the situation. He told me that they are going to start working on getting their prices for sticks at a more competitive level. I know they cannot compete with a huge company like Amazon, and I shouldn't have mentioned them against a small company like this. Thank you, Bruce for taking care of me!

WARNING!! Don't waste your time with this company! This guy is too overwhelmed to even provide common courtesy and return your calls. American Home Shield is the only reason we got connected with this company in the first place. He came out, said it was too hot to go into the attic, so he would come out in the morning. Understandable. Well he never showed up the next day, AC still isn't working, and now AHS is trying to find another technician. This company should not be in business!
