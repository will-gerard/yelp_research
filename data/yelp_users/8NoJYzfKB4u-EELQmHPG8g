We love Dr Curran and his office!  They have been so wonderful over the years with our daughters.  My oldest actually looks forward to visiting.  Excellent bedside manner and always takes the time to explain any questions you have.  He never makes you feel like you're asking something stupid.   The office staff is well organized and we never have to wait very long to get in.  We moved a bit of a distance from his office now, but we will continue to see him for as long as we live in Arizona!!!

The delivery is insanely fast!  And the food is delicious!  My daughter loves the chicken lo mein and I really like the General Tso's chicken and the crab puffs.

Couldn't tell you if the food is any good or not- Just called to place an order for delivery and the person who answered was incredibly rude! She said they couldn't deliver for an hour and a half, I said that's fine, could I just place my order now.  She said "no, you give me your number, I call back in an hour and a half." I said, "I can't leave my order with you?" She yelled at me, and said "no! I have other customer on the phone." Apparently, they don't need curtesy or customers, so probably won't call them again.

Oh my!! So delicious!  Everything we ordered was wonderful!  The kids' meal was great- and the Toffee dip with the apples is a new household craving! Good portion size and good value for the money.  When we went it was pretty quiet.  A nice place for a family lunch.  I'm looking forward to coming back here with my friends!

We recently had my daughter's birthday party here, and I was blown away.  Initially, it was a little chaotic, trying to sort out the shoe situation, but once the kids had their correct shoes, they started bowling and had a blast!  Every member of the staff from Melisa (the event manager) to Michael (our server) to the mechanics and servers and support staff we met truly provided excellence in customer service.  They all really wanted to make sure we were happy and having fun!  Melisa went out of her way to be accommodating with me and making it special for our birthday girl.  I loved that her primary concern was that my daughter had a great time.  She was so pleasant to work with!  The pizza was really good!  I mean, when I think of bowling alleys I typically don't think of great pizza.  I remember greasy triangles where the cheese slides off the slice.  But this was high quality- we will probably return for the pizza very soon!  One tip I would have for you is be aware that if you have small children, the mini golf area might be a little frightening (we lost a few golfers that way) but the kids seemed to really enjoy it!  Overall, we were told several times over this place was the best party they had been to in a long while.  Our guests loved it, we loved it. We are already looking forward to our next visit!
