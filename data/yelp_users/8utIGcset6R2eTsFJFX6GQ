Don't you dare call the Coffe Lady Cafe a "coffee shop," and NEVER compare it to starbuck's (corporate yuck.)  This is a restaurant with a full breakfast/lunch/brunch menu. They just also happen to be able to accommodate your routine morning cup, if that's all you have time for.  And that morning cup is great, the BEST cup of coffee going.  One more thing no other coffee shop can offer? Marie, the owner and "lady" behind the Coffee Lady Cafe name. This is the sweetest, friendliest person I've met in a long time. And she knows the meaning of "customer service."  The Coffee Lady Cafe is so good, they'll get you to change your morning routine.

I think this place is great, especially since the new owners took over.  Maria and Albino are almost always around to greet you and they're warm and friendly.  Good drink (GREAT MARGARITAS!) and very good traditional food. Big portions too for those of us getting tired a restaurants that treat Mexican food like it's nouvelle cuisine.  Great place.  Thanks guys.

This place blows. The service is slow and grumpy. The pizza is thin and chewy and WAY OVERPRICED.  The rest of the menu is small portions and, again, WAY OVERPRICED.  Nothing special tasting about anything served here either. Most of it tastes like Stouffers Frozen Food.  My Italian Gramma wouldve hit these guys in the head with a meatball. If any real Italian restaurants opened in the area, this place would sink like a brick. Just like the brick they put in my stomach.

Did i really just pay 13.29 for this pathetic sandwich? the "prime rib dip" looked so good on the menu, but what showed up at my table was a weak, dried up little sandwich, with no flavor, chewy overcooked meat, and served on what was nothing more than a tiny, hard oversized breadstick.  our waitress annie, while pleasant enough, seemed unconcerned with the fact that i only took one bite out of this sandwich before pushing it aside, and DID NOT want a to go container. i dine out a lot, and this was possibly the worst most overpriced thing i've been served in a long time.  The "game day nachos" were almost equally sad. at 8.99 they came with just a handful of chips and the same gross "cheez-whiz" style sauce you squirt on your nachos at the local 7-11. disgusting  the rest of my party seemed ok with their burgers, even though my son ate less than half of his, and also did not want a to go container.  at $65 for 3 people ($78 with tip) this was a completely dissatisfying and overpriced meal.

SORRY, but it's time for the LOVEFEST to end.  Of course this place is beautiful. They spent zillions to make it so. That's not the point. You don't go to a venue to look at the walls. You go for the show.  We saw Lewis Black at the Orpheum last night, and all I can do is give honest impressions.  When we first walked in, the entire place smelled like a fart. You get used to it, but it doesn't go away.  Although the bathroom facility was clean and somewhat spacious, there is ONE MEN'S ROOM & ONE LADIES ROOM, woefully inadequate for the size of the crowd. In fact, unless you have fortunate seating or sprint to the bathroom at the intermission, the line forms so quickly, you risk not making it back to your seat for the main event. We saw several people being ushered to their seats after Lewis Black hit the stage.  $7 for a 12oz can (Yes, CAN poured into a plastic cup), of Budweiser is just ridiculous. I understand you pay a premium price for refreshments at entertainment venues, but even the D-Backs, Cardinals, and trendy Scottsdale Night Clubs don't charge that much.  We sat in the 14th row of the orchestra section, what would be considered pretty good seats by most people's standards. We probably missed out on 1/3 of what was said due to horrible acoustics. If you know Lewis Black, you know that being able to hear him should never be a problem. Suffice to say, I have perfect hearing, and it wasn't just us. Throughout the show I could hear people asking their companions, "what did he say?" Only to be answered with a shoulder shrug. I don't know if they sound check an empty theatre, or at all for a comedian, and I'd bet things are different for amplified music, but it sure was frustrating struggling to hear one of my favorite comedians.  I'm glad the Orpheum is back and enjoying it's run, and things like the restroom situation can obviously never be changed (Gammage is waaaay worse, by the way), but if the sound thing isn't at least tweeked a little, they will only ever be an "ALSO RAN" venue in the Valley.

not a good meal.  this is just another in the increasingly disturbing trend of restaurants that, striving for "originality," think that all they need to do is come with something weird, give small portions and overcharge for it, and they can get get the trendy, hip & cool crowd.  i mean honestly, $7 for their "special fries? $12 for bruschetta? $12!!  their whole menu ranges from "not worth it" to "are you f**king kidding me?!?".  just look down at that ridiculously anemic fruit plate. that's $8!!  people who really want to eat and have an appetite, will hate this place. snobby people or people who are trying to impress each other with how easily they can throw away money, will love it.  I'm in the first group.

With nearly a thousand reviews of PIZZERIA BIANCO the polarity between love & hate is amazing. HERE IS THE ONLY REVIEW YOU'LL EVER NEED TO READ.  On one side of the aisle, you have the idiot trendoids who love bragging about how long they'll wait in line for restaurants, and how they were eating there before anybody else. They'll gladly report, "THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA EVER, WELL WORTH THE 3 HOUR WAIT!!!!" They also don't mind overpaying to be underfed. These people are easily recognized by their ability to spend $300 on an outfit that makes them look homeless and by their incessant need to always be sporting at least one Apple product.  The other camp is the folks who hate this place on a near personal level. They act as insulted by the food or wait time as they would be by a Nazi-sympathizer or a spit in the face. These are people who hate most everything that has proven to be popular with other people, and they hate Pizzeria Bianco, even though there's nothing hatable here.  Both groups are generously represented here. Both groups are full of shit. HERE'S THE TRUTH.  Best Pizza Ever? Hell no. You'd have to be functionally retarded to call this the "BEST" pizza you've ever eaten. In a lot of books, what is being served here wouldn't even qualify as pizza. An overly simple menu offers only 6 pie choices, 3 of which offer no tomato sauce and 2 offering no cheese. Pizzeria Bianco is really more of a Lavash than a pizza in that the crust is more of a toasted cracker than a pizza crust. This will lead to a soggy mess only minutes after your pie comes out of the oven. Is there any way, honestly, you can call something a pizza when your ingredient menu EXCLUDES PEPPERONI, MEATBALLS (ground beef of any kind), & GREEN PEPPERS. That's right, none of these exists on the premises. BEST PIZZA EVER?!? C'mon Corky, Life Goes On Without Pizzeria Bianco.  Worst Pizza Ever? Seriously? You never had a Totino's or a Lil Caesar's $5 crap pie? I truly believe the people who hate Pizzeria Bianco are really just hating on the people stupid enough to proclaim undying love for this place. This pizza(?) is not offensive in the least, even if it isn't really pizza. We actually liked the flavor of our WISE GUY. Again, we questioned whether of not it should even be classified as a pizza, but it was none-the-less tasty. Had I waited 2-3 hours, would I have been pissed off? Yep. Not to the point where I'm pissed off for life at everybody involved with the joint, like they shot my dog. Then again I'm not stupid enough to wait 2-3 hours at a place like this.  There's the rub with Pizzeria Bianco....the people who are claiming it to be the "best ever" and "well worth the hours wait" are absolute idiots, full of shit to the point of turning their eyes brown. Those who hate Pizzeria Bianco and it's fans like they contribute to Al Qaeda, have no real basis for their hatred and are way too over-reactive.  So judge for yourself.  Go down on a Saturday between 11am & noon to avoid the notorious wait times, drink a cold one and have lunch. You'll discover what we did; Pizzeria Bianco is simply a charming little place with nice people serving what may or may not be pizza. But that ain't so bad.

This review is a long time coming.  I've lived in Ahwatukee for 15 years, and Loretta's is the only place I would even think of buying any kind of jewelry.  From the first time i walked through the door, Loretta, the owner, has known my first name and treated me like a friend/family member.  She always has a good selection for whatever my budget, and she seems to be capable of giving the perfect advice, based not just on budget, but also on personal likes and dislikes.  She never tries to force a product on me, but instead listens to what i tell her and presents options.  Whether it be for my wife, my daughters, my mom, my dad, etc, I've never been disappointed.  You can go in to spend thousands, or less than a hundred, and she will treat you exactly the same; with the dignity, humor, and respect that has long fallen by the customer service wayside for a lot of businesses.  Now, she's buying gold and paying cash at a good rate, and she has converted half her showroom into a very nice upscale boutique.  Heck, she's even added an onsite psychic for your entertainment. Now, for a fee, you can have your furture foretold or your tarot cards read by Cheri, a true intuitive.  I love Loretta's Ahwatukee Jewelers!

How the hell you gonna trust a place to be authentic when they don't even know the difference between "parmesan" and "parmagiana," so they just combine them into a made up word. (WHAT THE HELL IS PARMASANA?)  "Parmagiana" is a style of cooking. "Parmesan" is the cheese you sprinkle on your spaghetti.  God! People can be so stupid.

You can some up the "SPRINKLES" experience in one word: RIDICULOUS! 1) Ridiculous Line. 2) Ridiculously overpriced. 3) Ridiculously tiny, tiny, TINY cupcakes. 4) Ridiculously bad taste. 5) Ridiculous to go to SPRINKLES instead of just buying from your local grocery store bakery.  RIDICULOUS!!!

I could barely roll out of bed in the morning. Then i started massage therapy with Pamela. She is so much more than just a spa massage. She works using massage to channel your bodies energy and create a whole body healthy experience.  I feel so much better now.  Thanks, Pamela.

Not a big guy for designer bakeries. Most of the time, your local grocery store will offer up something just as tasty, twice the size and half the price. And, after a very disappointing trip to SCOTTSDALE'S UBER-TRENDY "SPRINKLES," I was ok never venturing to another special order bakery again.  In fact, I didn't.  My wife picked up half a dozen assorted for my birthday recently. Boy, are they great The best, without a doubt was the "24 KARAT," a carrot cake and cream cheese frosting that was so amazing I WANTED TO HAVE SEX WITH IT.  I can't comment on décor, service, or any of the other reviewables I'm reading here, but for sheer yumminess, MIND OVER BATTER scores huge!!

Diggin' this place. Friendly staff, including the owner, Doug, who is always happy to see you. Nice & clean, and one of the best cheesesteaks in the east valley.  Great place.

Man, I guess I just don't get it. I've tried this place twice now, and was unimpressed both times. I really don't understand the excitement over this place.  Just another example of how Eastern transplants to the Phoenix area clamor for anything from "BACK HOME." Plus, this place is way too expensive for an "Order at the Counter" burger joint.  Went in last time with a buddy: 2 REG burgers, 1 REG order of fries to split, NO DRINKS - $17.02 WOW! Not to mention (but I will), that it took over 15 minutes to get my order, when this place was nearly empty!!!  The burger was bland and overcooked. The bacon was burnt and crumbled, not even in strips, but looked like somebody just put some charred bac-o-bits on it. High marks for the freshness of the toppings, but so what. After all, it's not called "5 Guys Toppings," is it.  And the fries couldn't be worse if you were actually trying to make them BAD. Just a bland, greasy mess. Yuck.  Maybe, if somebody offers to buy me lunch and insists on 5 Guys, I'll give them another shot. Otherwise; NO WAY!

Anytime a new trend develops, you can count on the hipster trendoids loving everything about said trend, paying ridiculously overpriced tabs, and bragging how they got there first.  One of the latest trends is, in a need to pretend to be eating healthy, eating some really weird stuff, that is marketed and wrapped in words like ORGANIC, WHOLE and TRUE.  "YUMMERS! The Clarified Tibetin Yak Feces on Mandarin Chiffonade Soil Wafers with Escargot Infused Pablano Aioli is the best thing I've ever had."  Yeah, Ok. For the trendsetters, trendoid wanna-bes, and lemming followers, this sounds great. There are a few of us, however, who understand that you're just eating YAK SHIT, ON A DIRT CRACKER, WITH SNAILS AND MAYONNAISE.  Cut to True Food Kitchen in Scottsdale. With delights on the menu such as TUSCAN KALE SALAD, BUTTERNUT SQUASH PIZZA, "INSIDE OUT" QUINOA BURGER,  and SHITAKE & TOFU LETTUCE CUPS, made from quality ingredients like SULTANA, FARRO, COCONUT SHELLFISH BROTH, & TELEGGIO, Yak Shit lovers must be cartwheeling.  I made the mistake of ordering a Turkey Burger from True Food Kitchen at the behest of a Yak Shit eating co-worker who "just had to have" a Bison Burger.  For $12 you get the following; Turkey Burger, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato, Avocado, Mayo & Flax Seed Bun. Seems harmless enough, even almost tasty.  Nope.  It's hard to imagine screwing up a turkey burger this badly. Soggy, greasy, slimy....JUST PLAIN BAD. REALLY BAD!!  The patty was dry. The bun was a soaky soggy. The worst, from a place that boasts "Honest food that tastes really good," is the terrible condition of the produce on this burger; slimy to the point of being gelatinous. Just plain gross. I took one bite and threw the rest away.  Sorry, True Food Kitchen. I won't be back.  Enjoy the KALE-ADE, THE SPAGHETTI SQUASH CASSEROLE & THE GRASS-FED BISON. To me, It's all just Yak Shit.

WARNING: GIANT BLACK HAIR IN FOOD!!!  I wish could give this place negative stars, not just for the disgustingness of the above statement, but for the handling of the situation afterward.  We ordered Yogi's for takeout for our family of 3 fairly good eaters. I was only a few bites into my large Teriyaki chicken/beef combo, when my fork produced a THICK, 10-INCH LONG BLACK HAIR. Nothing is quite as awe-inspiring as a LONG BLACK HAIR, DRIPPING TERIYAKI SAUCE, on the fork you had been putting into your mouth. Yum. So impressive was this sight, in fact, that it inspired my entire family to throw their food away and eat PBJs for the night.  I'm not unreasonable. And I get that, even in this age of Health Compliance, Hairnets, and Ponytails, sh*t happens. Just be a little more careful next time and give me my money back. NOPE!  I called YOGI's to let them know I wasn't interested in their hair products. A polite, yet ineffective kid answered the phone. After telling me the manager, Brian, was gone for the evening he asked why I needed the manager, and "MAYBE" he could help. He couldn't, but that didn't stop him from wanting to hear the whole story before letting me know that.  He told me to call back the next day at 5PM.  NOPE! "Sorry, you just missed him. Try again this time tomorrow."  NOPE! "sorry."  The day after that I called at 2:30 just to give Brian a little well-deserved nap time.  NOPE! "Wow, he never leaves this early." Truly a fascinating oddity.  Next day, 11:30AM, "dees bryn." F**KING GREAT!! You see, Brian apparently doesn't speak English very well. I have absolutely no problem with other cultures or people seeking their pot of gold in America. In fact, I think it's great. It's just difficult to communicate OVER THE PHONE, with somebody who knows 12 words of English.  Next thing I know, the kid is back on the phone, acting as Brian's semi-translator. They let me know that, if I can get there before 5pm (this is a work day), and produce my receipt from 4 days ago, BRIAN WILL LOOK AT IT. Not provide me with a fee meal, or give me back my money. LOOK AT IT.  F*CK the ranger, Boo Boo? NO F*CK YOU, YOGI's. I won't be back.

Ok....so it's official...this place blows. I went a second time to be sure. Yep; BLOWS! Bad sign when a good number of the reviews on Yelp reference THE OLIVE GARDEN (the quintessential example of mediocrity) as a better option.  We tried to ignore our first trip to Babbo, because they were the new kid on the block, which meant they were busy and likely prone to a mistake or two.1) We ignored the fact that there were empty tables, but we were still told we'd have to wait for a table or sit at the bar (we sat at the bar). 2) We tried to ignore that it took forever for our food to come. 3) We tried to ignore that the PASTA PUGLIA had less flavor than a wet dishrag. 4) We even tried to ignore that our server/bartender's take on our crappy food came 20 minutes after delivery and was literally, "I didn't notice you weren't eating your food. You should've said something."  We waited a year to return....MISTAKE.  This time it was take-out, and we ordered a lot, to be sure; BRUSCHETTA ROMANA, PISATCHIO MOZZARELLA, MUSHROOM-PEPPERONI-SAUSAGE PIZZA, ALFREDO SUPREMO W/CHICKEN, & BABBO'S BOWL O BOLGNESE.  Our online order told us 20 minutes, which is exactly when we arrived, only to be told by a polite young man, named Raphael, that everything was done but our pasta dishes. REALLY?!? 15 minutes later (yep) we were heading home. The timing undoubtedly contributed to some of the earlier dishes being less than great, but really probably not so much as they're just not very good to start with.  BRUSHETTA ROMANA - We appreciate that the Tomato/Basil mixture was separated from the toasted bread for travel, but it didn't matter. The topping mix felt pre-made, soggy, soupy and gross. FAIL!  PISTACHIO MOZZARELLA - Interesting choice, mixing pistachio nuts with your traditional Caprese Salad, and it would have worked, if it WAS a traditional Caprese Salad. It Isn't. This dish isn't what you're expecting in that it really scrimps on the Mozzarella, choosing to drop a few cubes on top, instead of matching the tomatoes slice for slice. Also, drenched in balsamic, the entire dish turned into a soggy mess.  MUSHROOM-PEPPERONI-SAUSAGE PIZZA - Gross, Gross GROSS!!! The crust was flavorless and chewy. The sauce was non-existent. The ingredients were sparse to the point of wondering where they were, including cheese. I'm not sure what they're going for here, but, if it isn't "REPULSE THE CUSTOMER," They're falling miserably short.  ALFREDO SUPREMO W/CHICKEN & BOWL O BOLGNESE - We can combine the pasta dishes because our review is the same for both. The portions are ridiculously small (c'mon guys, it's pasta), and the flavor is unremarkable. A frozen MARIE CALLENDAR'S DINNER would provide a more satisfying dining experience.  It's difficult, in this part of Chandler, to find decent Italian food. I guess, for now, countless reviewers are right; OLIVE GARDEN is a better option.

One of the irritating inevitabilities about living in The Valley is eventually being unable to escape some douchebag who migrated here from ANY OTHER METROPOLITAN AREA, and drones on incessantly about how much better things are "BACK HOME."  Chicagoans might very well be the worst.  Enter Portillo's.  Know somebody from Chicago? (Who doesn't? They're everywhere. Like cockroaches.) Ask them about Portillo's, and you'll never get them to shut up. "Dis is da gratess hot dug effer." "you kain't git hot dugs like dis in Feenix." "I'd keel yoo for a Portillo's"  On and on.  It's a hot dog guys, nothing more, nothing less. You'd do just as well from a CART GUY ON A DOWNTOWN STREET CORNER.  We arrived at the new Tempe location and parking situation was a clusterf**k-zoo, which I can't see getting any better any time soon. Portillo's DID have staff poised in the lot to assist, but they seemed just as confused as most of the drivers.  Inside? Holy Crap. Cavernous and full. Very busy, very loud and very colorful. Portillo's has a standard walk up counter for ordering, but today we were greeted by order takers who would then hand back our written orders to give to the people behind the counter. After paying, you are given a number and guided to the other end of the restaurant to wait at an "order up" counter. BTW, the lady working the mike and calling order numbers was extremely irritating, sounding like a carnival barker and, for some reason, feeling it was necessary to add a rhyming quip to every number called.  I think this Portillo's was purposely over-staffed because it was grand-opening week, and they were still working out the kinks.  ONE KINK IN SERIOUS NEED OF A WORK OUT was delivery and presentation. we ordered 2 JUMBO CHILI DOGS, 1 LARGE CHEESE FRY AND A LARGE ROOT BEER. We waited 20 minutes and what we got was a soggy lukewarm mess. We were confused as to why were asked "for here, or to go" when we ordered, as, even though we clearly stated we were dining in, we were handed a paper sack of food and a drink TO GO.  Chili dogs don't wrap in paper very well. So what we unwrapped was a couple of smashed, room temperature messes with half the chili sticking to the paper wrapping. The dog was only ok, the chili generic, and they were a little too generous with the onions, but like I said before, "HEY IT'S JUST A HOT DOG." In this instance, a hot dog with absolutely nothing special going on.   The cheese fries were hot and tasty with the cheese served on the side (again, in a to go cup). Not nearly enough cheese to satisfy the large order of spuds though, and I later noticed it was the same sized cup of cheese that came with the small order of fries too.  I would discount this place as just another not worth it FRANCHISE OF THE "BACK-HOMERS," and the parking situation really does need a fix. But just as we were finishing up, I spied a rather frail elderly lady hoisting a ITALIAN BEEF, and man, did she look happy. Happy enough, in fact, to make me want to go back to Portillo's and give it another shot, this time with the ITALIAN BEEF.  However, if you're just looking for a hot dog to throw down for lunch, see the guy on the street corner and avoid the Portillo's hassle.  After all, IT'S JUST A HOT DOG.  *********************************************************************** UPDATE ALERT!!! ***********************************************************************  9/21/13  Ok....went back and tried that Italian Beef I referred to earlier. Nope. Nothing special. Not bad, not great. There are a lot of "CHICAGO JOINTS" in The Valley. So far, none can hold a candle to LUKE'S Italian Beef.  Just as many employees as the first time, but, even though Portillo's was much less crowded than the first time I went (is the luster really wearing off that fast?), the employees seemed even less organized  Once again, our food took a little too long to come, and was, once again packed TO GO even though we specifically, ONCE AGAIN, said we were dining in.  Overall, after 2 trips to Portillo's, nothing special or worth the crowd, wait time, or parking hassle.
