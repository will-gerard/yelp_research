My daughter Alexa is in Second Grade at Broadmor. I absolutely love this school!   Alexa has been attending this school since Kindergarten. Her Kindergarten teacher was Ms. Lieber. We love Ms Lieber, she is such an amazing teacher... I really do not have enough time to describe how wonderful and amazing it was to have her as our daughter's Kindergarten teacher. We are definitely looking forward to having our Twin Girls in her class starting in Aug 2012. Ms Bowdren was Alexa's first grade teacher, another amazing teacher but she unfortunately no longer teaches at Broadmor. Alexa's teacher this year is Mrs Inman, a teacher just as wonderful as Ms. Lieber. All of the teachers that we have had the opportunity to interact with have been amazing. The teachers are all very caring and very attentive to our child's academic needs.   This school honestly has an amazing PTA. Although admittedly I don't participate in as many event as I would like, they are always very welcoming of us when we do come to participate. Broadmor is not a Title 1 school, so without the PTA and all of the effort they put into fundraising and the amount of parent involvement in general, this school would probably not be as amazing as it is.  This school is just great. I really can't imagine that any of the other elementary schools in Tempe could compare.

We have 3 Broadmor students. I really just can't imagine having our kids in any other school.   Our oldest child is in PACE and the academic standards for the entire school are not too far behind.   We have loved nearly all of the teachers that have had the honor of teaching our children. For the ones we didn't quite love as much, well, you win some, you lose some. Some people just don't get along with each other. I can not say anything bad about their skills as teachers because my children are all coming along fine. Their personalities just weren't for us as I'm sure our personalities weren't for them.  The Learning Patch is awesome and I truly wish I had more time to volunteer and be a more active part of the PTA. The garden is completely volunteer run, so if you have some extra time on a scheduled workday, please stop by. If you have things to donate: plants, seeds, gardening tools, etc... those things are all happily accepted as well.  The PTA: without question or argument, this school would not be what it is without the immense amount of parent involvement. I have heard several people make mention of the the PTA being "cliquish" but I have not personally experienced that type of behavior. I admittedly do not participate as often as I would like to but any time that I have stopped in, I have felt welcomed.  I can not recommend this school enough. It has an amazing community.

I stopped by this McDonalds yesterday before work. I knew I wanted some nuggets and maybe fries. I got to the window and ordered nuggets. I wanted a second to decide if I wanted the full meal or anything else but the girl in the drive thru rushed me so I decided not to get anything other than the nuggets. I know it's "fast" food and ideally I should come through the drive thru and already know what I want to buy, but I wasn't going to spend more than 2 minutes looking at the menu and deciding. It wasn't even busy, there was no one behind me and this location has two speakers. Even when I went to pay she was in too much of a hurry and practically threw my change at me. I won't go out of my way to come here again. I ended up going to Burger King for a whopper and fries a few hours later. If  the girl at the window had been a little more patient then I probably would have just gotten a full meal and drink from McDonalds.  2 Stars because the girl at the second window was nice and the nuggets weren't bad.

Best Sangria I have ever had!  I was with a friend and we were in the area and hungry so I used yelp to search something nearby and ended up here.  Pricey? Yes, quite so... I'm never really in the habit of checking the price rating for Mexican food places but I will definitely do so from now on. The price is the reason for the four star rating. I feel they should have larger portions for the price.  The food was great. I had chicken soup, it was tasty. We shared a chef's special which that night was lamb. It was very good as well. We had the pastel de tres leches and it was fantastic.   The service was great! The server was right on top of everything and took some time to explain the menu items and give us recommendations. We got there just before their closing time and they didn't rush us at all the entire time we were there.  This a great date place. Look forward to coming here next time with husband.

I come here often in the evening/night. The customer service is always top notch. The staff are super courteous and they get the orders correct all of the time. It's always timely as well. I have only come through here once and had a bit of a wait time. At that time they apologized and offered a free drink. This is my favorite Jack in the Box by far.

If I had reviewed this place after only eating their food a few times, I would probably have given them 5 stars.. I've ordered delivery from them about 8 times total between the middle of march and now. The first 4 times we had food from them they were excellent! The food was delicious the delivery didn't take very long, the delivery guy was great. Overall, those first 4 experiences were awesome. Since then their service has gone downhill consistently. The last time that we ordered from them our order was entirely screwed up and we had waited 1hr & 50 mins for chile relleno, 2 tacos, 2 horchatas, and a taco salad. All of our food was cold and we only got 1 horchata because the delivery driver dropped the other one. Their tacos are usually great but these were just bad. Anyway, I'm not sure what's been going on at Moreno's in Tempe, but everytime we've ordered from them it's gotten worse. I hope this is temporary because when we first had their food, I loved it.

$0.50 drinks for ladies on Weds nights. I have only gone twice, but both times I have had a great time with cheap drinks. The dance floor is huge and even if you've come alone, it's not hard to find a dance partner. I didn't have any creepy guy experiences there either. There is nothing worse than when you're trying to enjoy some drinks with the girls and some random scumbag starts grabbing your ass.  I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 stars because the last time I was there, they were out of sour, sprite and few other things that I liked mixed with my liquor.  All around pretty nice place for a night of dancing and drinks.

I really like the Wash Wizard. The owner, Sam, takes a lot of pride in his business and strives to make sure that his employees are providing the best service possible. I have only ever had an issue here once (employee in the car wash was texting instead of washing my van... Kids these days!) and Sam was quick to resolve it and it has never been an issue since. Their prices are very reasonable. They always do a great job with the interior cleaning. If you're looking for excellent service at a reasonable price then the Wash Wizard is definitely for you.

I had lunch here with my sister. We shared some hummus. My sister had the Greek salad and I had the Caf√© 8 Omelette. The food was super delicious. Honestly if I lived on that side of the valley, I would eat here often.  It was really busy when we first arrived. The place is small so if you have a party larger than 2, I would suggest calling ahead to make sure that they have space unless you don't mind waiting.  I'm giving them 4 Stars instead of 5 because the owner was upset with the guy that was working the counter and scolded him in front of everyone. He also sent him over to apologize to both my sister and I for not seating us more promptly... This kind of confused me, while I appreciate the fact that the owner was trying to be proactive, we honestly had not thought anything of the almost 10 minutes that we waited. It was busy and we had a baby car seat with us, so we needed to find a place to fit both of us and the car seat. I felt like it was a little harsh to send an employee to offer an apology for some imagined slight. I feel that the situation with the employee could have been handled with a little more tact. I would not have appreciated that treatment if I were that employee.  I will definitely go there again when I'm in the area.

Chips and Salsa were delicious!  Enchiladas were fantastic.  I am so happy to have found this little gem. I work down the street and am definitely looking forward to coming here again. The owner was so nice.   We have been there several times now. Each time the service has been wonderful. There are a few TVs for watching sports. I haven't had a chance to try any of their margaritas, but I'm looking forward to my next trip there.

Try the Dana it's Delicious.  The drinks are fabulous! I really like stopping by here while I'm waiting for my car to get cleaned at Wash Wizard. Every time that I have been here the staff are super friendly and seem to genuinely enjoy what they're doing.   Looking forward to being a long-time customer. :D

I'm giving them 2 stars because the last time, I came here the staff were very courteous and helpful. The woman working the counter today was the opposite. I get it, you looked tired, you probably want to go home. I just got off of a hard day of work as well so I understand. What I don't understand however, is the sighing and the condescending tone. Will not be coming back again.

Stopped in with a co-worker. Walked up to order and let the cashier know that it would be a moment because it was our first time. They were super friendly and offered us some of the outrageous sauce and some fries to try it out. I found the outrageous sauce to be a little too spicy but it had a nice taste. Burgers were delicious, I will definitely go back again.

Overall, my experience with Speedy has been great. I am sad that I will no longer be able to stop in for my regular breakfast tacos, since they have changed their hours. I used to stop in right before work, but now they open too late. :(  I usually order carne asada tacos or quesadilla. I ordered a chicken breakfast taco once, the chicken looked to be under cooked. When I returned it and asked for a beef taco instead, they were very apologetic and made sure to get me another taco asap. This is the reason, for the 4 stars instead 5. Raw chicken is usually a deal breaker for me, but I had been there so many times before and had great tacos, that I didn't feel it would be fair to bash them for this one mistake. None of us are perfect, right?   Their jamaica is usually really good. :D
