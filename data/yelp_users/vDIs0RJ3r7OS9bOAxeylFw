Some people might be scared of the surrounding business or the looks but this place is great for a quick lunch. I review things for what they are not comparing to other restaurants that are in different prices ranges and experiences.     I work nearby and walked over for a slice and salad. It was quick, crispy with some old fashioned over burns like I want it. It's clean and the clientele were all normal people just like me. The owner seemed to know people by name and by eating here I'm supporting the local economy and a small family owned business. Very affordable combos starting at around $5.

I've heard a lot about this place over the ten years I've lived in the valley. I've always wanted to try it and see what all the fuss is about. I've heard several times that they have the best Mexican food in the valley.   I went for lunch during the week and ordered a green chile burrito and a red tamale. The burrito was runny and soggy and the inside was almost like a can if Dinty Moore, the tamale was dry, very little meat, too much masa and didn't taste very good. It was a complete let down after hearing so much over the years and I would say that any local Filabertos has better food after my first visit. I'll give it another shot and that might change my review some.  The other reviews mention it's legacy and the dive location so I'll let them cover that as well as the butter tortillas.

In 2004 Bobs took $1,500 from me as a college student. I entered a contract with them for a Honda 900rr for $5,000 that I would pay in monthly while they store the bike. Two months in they sold the bike and refused to give me my money back and only in store credit for their sparse and crappy inventory. Being young and in college I didn't use the courts like I should have but I can save others a headache by utilizing Yelp.

Some of the best street tacos in Phoenix.There are several factors here including the price. You can pay upwards of $7 for a street taco in Scottsdale that will be overly complicated and not as good as these which 1/3 the price. The carne asada, carnitas and marinated pork tacos are both flavorful and tender, I suggest using some of the green and red sauce they provide to add flavor with a squeeze of lemon. If you haven't ever tried Lengua (cow tongue) this is the place to try it but I prefer the others mentioned above. The homemade tortillas are always soft yet don't fall apart. Love this place for street tacos.

Fuddruckers is a burger place. Unfortunately you pay $30 for two people to have a combo and the burgers are flavorless. I don't understand why most burger places don't create their won meat mix of different cuts, mix their beef with ingredients or at least season their meat. The toppings on top are great but they don't add flavor to the actual hamburger patty. My wife got the Kobe burger..of course a $9 Kobe burger isn't really Kobe beef but it was flavorless as well.

This is the best Mexican restaurant chain in AZ. They always have provided good quality food, proportions and prices. My favorite thing to order there is the Grande Plate Three enchiladas, one beef, one cheese, and one sour cream chicken, chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco, and guacamole and beans/papas. Get the "papas" versus the beans they are crudely mashed with spices and skins. They also have great drinks and the margaritas are pretty good. The atmosphere feels like upscale dining with great architecture, art, music and professional wait staff.

I found this place on Yelp and based on the reviews I had great expectations. I liked that it was a locally owned business and that it was rather simple. Everyone on Yelp recommended the Philly Cheese steak. It definitely wasn't anything special, the meat was a little dry, the bread wasn't authentic cheese steak break but rather what you would find on any sub. I haven't had a cheese steak I like that uses provolone instead of whiz. The one awesome thing that came out of the experience was their homemade dog biscuits. My dog loved them and they were made of all natural ingredients.

Love this place, great bistro Mexican food and good proportions and prices. My favorite thing to order there is the Grande Plate with comes with everything. If you have the choice get the "papas" versus the beans.

This is an extremely nice rec center with the best of everything. It has a beautiful full sized basketball court and indoor track on the second floor and an Olympic sized indoor pool. Along with their regular classes and activities they also provide child care for the busy adult.

This is the best used tire place in the east valley. They are trustworthy and will fill your tires for free. They've never given me a bad tire and their prices are fair with great customer service. If you checkin at the location they will rotate your tires for free and fill them up!

I love this place and have been going here for almost 6 years. As noted by other reviews don't expect a fancy experience this is simple, clean, non-greasy food without the gobs of cheese littering most Arizona Mexican food. This is not Tex Mex with Tina of sour cream, guacamole, sauce and extras. It's good old fashion Mexican that your family would make. It's fast, the service is great and I personally love their salsa. I'll be there again as soon as possible!

The Vig is a great place to stop in for a good lunch during the day. I love the fact that it has outdoor seating yet blocks out the busy streets of Phoenix. Their Ruben is delicious especially the pretzel bun version, they also have great posole and tacos. During happy hour they have decent drink specials and appetizers plus you can play "corn hole" aka bag toss.

I've been going here for 3 years now and it is one of my favorite places to eat in the Phoenix Metro. Now that they have expanded the restaurant I don't really have anything negative to say about the place at all. Their food is fantastic, the atmosphere is laid back and the prices are very reasonable. I've tried several of the Pasties and while they are all fantastic my favorite is the Lamb vindaloo. If you haven't been here yet it is a must try!

I visited D'vine for dinner during the week. The location is convenient off the 202 and it does offer a nice atmosphere with patio and occasional live music. Beyond those qualities is where the experience was lacking.  The prices are a little high for the food quality which must be priced for the affluent Las Sendas neighborhood nearby. I ordered the pasty and my wife ordered the bistro chicken. The pasty was disappointing and was like pot roast in an empanada, Cornish Pasty is much better and half the cost. My wife's chicken was bland all around. The service was a little slow as well rounding off a fair 3 star rating. Not sure if ill go back.

They have the most counter employees I've seen at a post office. Not only are they fast and courteous but they have gone through several boxes from the back to find something that my item will fit in and be economical to mail. This location has a lot of semi-truck traffic, safety deposit boxes and is located in a less than stellar neighborhood. It is still an awesome example of our postal service at work.

This place is the cleanest, largest and most friendly dog park in the east valley. My Dog absolutely loves this pace and there are dog lovers who show up regularly. Look for a huge dog the size of a bear named Sneakers, he's a lovable giant who can fit six tennis balls in his mouth at once!

I love Tasty Joes! This place is a wonderful little Thai place for takeout during the week. It's fresh, fast and can be extremely flavorful if you ask for the right hotness. I see some reviews on here comparing it to Thai restaurants, let's not compare apple to oranges. This is in the same category as Panda Express but is higher quality, better tasting, fresher and is cooked in front of you to your preferences. Delicious.

This place has the best Philly cheese steaks in the Phoenix metro area. I have one thing to say and that is get it "whiz wit" the cheese and onion combination makes it heavenly. The second best thing is their fries which are always crisp and not too greasy. I recommended this a foodie from New York who's husband is from Philly and they both commented that this place is "legit".

Dishonest thieves. This place is terrible. I left a pair of $150 Oakley's here during the day. I called an hour later and they said they found them. By the time I made it down there to pick them up they were gone, despite being stored where only employees have access.   I sent numerous complaints to corporate and to the manager. Corporate completely ignored me. The manager said he would ask the employees but never would respond back to me. They didn't even offer to pay for the sunglasses their employees stole. Not an offer for free food. Terrible, dishonest business.

I wanted to like this place and have it become my sweets destination with my co-workers. However the last time we went in one coworker and I grabbed cups and started making our yogurt using the self service machines. The other two coworkers within asked for a sample and were in the fence about ordering. When they decided not to buy the owner confronted them and chastised them "uh hello? You're leaving? Ask for a sample and leave, I'm trying to run a business here!" This all happened as we were at the register and was awkward and inappropriate. The yogurt is pretty standard just like all the other places in town.

Genghis grill rocks. If you like YCs then you will love this place. I prefer it because they have larger bowls, the meats aren't frozen and their selection is better. I so like the fact that hey have predetermined recipes that you can follow on some cards before you enter the line.

I went here for lunch with co-workers. The decor is pretty out dated and the blue chairs had cracking and torn vinyl and weren't very comfortable. I'm not sure why but halfway through lunch they opened the doors and left them open, flies started buzzing around our food and table.  Their food is typical Arizona Mexican food with bland flavor and no authenticity. If you are looking for a Mexican dining experience this isn't the place. We started off with guacamole, chips and salsa. The guacamole was tasteless and didn't have enough cilantro, onions or tomatoes it also didn't have any chopped serranos/jalapenos plus it needed salt. I ordered the carne asada tacos which had very dry corn tortillas, they had to be at least a few days old and left out uncovered. The meat was dry, a little chewy and lacked in flavor as well. The butter rice was good and the bean were good but lets be honest how can you mess those up.

This has to be the best buffer in the Phoenix Metro. If you can make it through the smoke stink lobby you'll be surprised by the level of elegance in the buffet room and how excellent the service is. The employees are attentive, helpful and courteous. The food is much better than a Golden Corral type buffet and better than some Vegas hotels as well. For $20 you can eat yourself into a coma and know you ate good clean food. If you go here for lunch be prepared to take a nap in your car around 3 PM.

This place is absolutely terrible. I dropped off my car and was told it would be done in an 1-1.5 hours and to come back. They didn't have me fill out paperwork or ask for my number. Matter of fact they didn't even acknowledge my presence until I started going toward the entity office which was vacant.  I came back and my car had the door panel resting on the convertible top, which no convertible owner wants to see, and I was told that I would be done in half an hour. I live 30 minutes away. I came back 45 minutes later and it was still not done, this is where asking me for my phone number would have come in handy so they could notify me.   Four hours later it was done. The window doesn't lock into the door seal like it should, they broke the interior panel of my side mirror, the door's foam insulation was in my back seat. I'm not sure if they replaced it or just decided not to use it because they ripped it - to replace it will be $30-$60. If they can't do a window regulator right who in their right mind would let them do their windshield.  Cons: crappy service, crappy workmanship, no respect for your time, terrible environment, unprofessional, no standards, no communication, they damage your car, probably no bonded.  Pros: cheap if you don't mind the above and paying for repairing your car right or paying to repair damage they do.

I don't want to spend a whole lot of time reviewing this place. It could be nice because of the location, vibe and drinks but the food is mediocre. The service is also slow and I feel like they should invest in full sized tables for the patio and misters.

I got an alignment at the Tempe location on Scottsdale Road and the mechanic exited my vehicle and handed me my keys with greasy hands and clothes. My seats were not covered with the normal plastic cover or the floor covered with the standard paper. I got in my car and noticed there was what appeared like a large dirt ring on my passenger seat where something was obviously placed and at the time I wasn't sure if I saw scuff. As I drove off I noticed the steering wheel was a little off to the left. Upon returning they were open to driving and making sure it was correct. I have no gripes out their friendliness, customer service or repairs in that regard.  When receiving my car the second time I noticed there was a screw driver sitting in my passenger seat I realized there were thin scratches on my bolster which were not there and all I could think about was that screw driver. Further into the drive I looked at my steering wheel and noticed that it was scratched and chipped as well, being meticulous about my car I know these damages weren't there before. I am left with 3-4 scratches in my bolster ($30-$100 depending on the service), the steering wheel damage ($107.00 plus shipping) and would love to complain but am afraid my car would be damaged more in the process of them fixing it. It is the small things you do to make sure you customer's car is taken car of that complete the experience and my experience has left me holding a bill for repairs that could have been avoided with some care and the right precautions.

This is a great little breakfast place. It's now called Mike's Cafe but it is virtually the same place. I love supporting local businesses over chains so I go here for my weekend brunches.

I heard about Binks from a coworker who had been to Binkley's so I figured I would try it for Mother's Day. Much like another reviewer I hate valet but they were very courteous. Once in the restaurant I how quaint the place was and the decor, several people asked if we had been helped or if we needed anything but that is where the good service stopped.  We waited 5 minutes for our table to be prepped, we had a reservation so I'm not sure why it wasn't done already. It then took 10 minutes before some came to our table to give us water, yet another 10-15 minutes before our server came to our table. The drinks took another 15 minutes to get. It was around 5:00pm, there were only about four tables with people so the slow service was inexcusable. Once we ordered the food was delivered in a flash I was lured into the all you can eat pork, salad, bread and potatoes (more on this later), while my wife had the flat iron steak. They has roasted a pig and it sounded like a great special. The food was very good overall, the pork had great flavor and small gristly pieces in it like pork grinds, it made it unique. The steak was phenomenal, cooked to perfection and very tender. Some of the side dishes seem to be over thought and forced.  The service is where the experience fell apart, in the 90 minutes we were there the waiter never came back. They never asked if I wanted another drink, how I was doing, refilled the water, nothing. I wanted more of the all you can eat pork special mentioned above but never had the opportunity, the bus boys came and cleared everything but my waiter was nowhere to be seen. After 20 minutes of sitting around with a empty table like I was squatting he finally comes and at that point I was frustrated with the experience and quickly asked for the bill disregarding that I wanted another serving. For the price I expect more from the service industry part of the business. It turned would should have been an excellent dining experience into a less than average, I would gladly go to a place with lower caliber food but better service so I can get more than one drink and actually get more of the food I paid for as part of the advertised special.

We came here for a typical date night because all the other restaurants in north east Mesa has long waits.   The positives are it wasn't busy and they have good beers on tap. They have plenty of TVs for sports watching and the bar can make any drink. Their wings were good and they have some good flavored available.   The bad is the service was inattentive. The wings were the best part. It went down hill after that. We ordered nachos as an appetizer and they were absolutely terrible. The guacamole was old and bitter, the cheese was shredded cheese that was melted in the microwave. The ground beef appeared to be a frozen hamburger and overall they had to be the worst nachos I've ever had. This place could be a great spot but they need to work on their food and service quality. They had items that were not available but still on the menu.

Desert Schools is the best financial institution in the Phoenix Valley. Their customer service is top notch and their friendly staff always makes me feel welcome. Because they are a credit union I know they won't fee me to death will all kinda of crazy hidden scenarios like a big bank. If you have lived in the valley for awhile you know that they are also a huge presence as far as community service and volunteering.
