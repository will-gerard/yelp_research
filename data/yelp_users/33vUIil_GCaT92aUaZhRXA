My mom & I came here on Sunday to see Hairspray. We got an awesome deal on Groupon, two tickets for $45. This theatre is very tiny, pretty sure it's smaller than most school's auditoriums but that didn't take away from the production. Lighting & sound was great. We loved the show, too cute & great songs. It was pretty long too; started at 6:30pm, at 8:00pm had a 10-15 minute intermission, then ended around 9:00pm. The only negatives were that the seats weren't too comfy & the bathrooms were a lil dirty & smelled horrible. But besides that, I definitely recommend seeing Hairspray!  P.S. They announced that this was their 90th year, congrats!

I had to bump Zoe's up a star! Their hummus & pita plate is delish & I love the spinach roll ups, I think they're better than the chicken ones. I also bought a refillable cup that I can bring back for 99 cent refills. I usually come here to get a light, healthy lunch, but if you're feeling like some dessert their chocolate cake is freaking amazing!

I've been to the AZ Science Center a handful of times in the past, but Sunday was my 1st time going to an exhibit. Groupon ran a deal for Body Worlds & The Brain, 2 tickets for the price of 1, so I was all over that. I should have known better than to go on the last day, it was packed! I had purchased our tickets for the 3pm showing, we were 20 minutes late, but luckily we were able to get in with the 3:30pm group. Body Worlds & The Brain was so interesting! We took our time & read every single description next to each display piece. Before we knew it we had gone through the entire exhibit in less than an hour. What bothered me though was the set up, there were so many people jammed into the space it was a complete clusterfuck. Either they need to let less people in at a time, or have a walkway roped off so you aren't squeezing your way through people to see all the displays. We were able to walk around the science center after the exhibit, but we have been in the past & didn't feel like dealing with all the kids running around & screaming. I'd love to come back for another exhibit, an IMAX showing & "Adults Night Out"!

I had to downgrade my rating after last night's delivery. I received a free delivery coupon from Delicious Deliveries so we used it for dinner. There weren't a lot of options in my zip code so we settled on Macayo's.   We started out with the green corn tamale bites. I didn't care for them but my hubby seemed to enjoy them. They also gave us a big bag of chips with sides of salsa, pretty good as I stated in my previous review. For our entrees, my hubby ordered the steak fajitas & I ordered the carne asada burrito (with rice & beans added). Hubby said his fajitas were pretty good but my burro was gross. The bottom was so soggy I couldn't eat it as a whole, just picked at it & threw a lot away. For dessert I ordered the flan & since our order was over $30 we got a free dessert as well so I chose the mini chocolate chimis. The flan was ok & the chocolate chimis with ice cream were pretty good.   Total with tip & free delivery was about $50. We won't be ordering here again...I'm pretty much just done with the whole food delivery service thing after 2 expensive, not so great meals.

My mom wanted to go here for lunch last Friday & I was actually kinda excited, because it's been a few years since I last came here. Parking was a bitch & that was a task in itself! Any way, we made our way back to the hostess stand & was told there would be a 30 minute wait. For lunch, really?! We decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait.   Lindsey was our server & she was so sweet, checked on us often too. For starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip. I forgot how big the portions are, what were we thinking ordering 2 apps?! The boom dip was yummy but the calamari was just ok, way too much breading/coating! For our entree we decided to split the 14" aunt margherita pizza (thin crust) & added artichokes. My mom only had a bite since she ate a lot of the apps, I had a slice & it was ok. Pretty bland in flavor, barely any cheese & the crust had a similar texture to cardboard. I took the leftovers home & my hubby agreed, he wasn't diggin the pizza either.   Total (not including tip) was about $40. While the food was just ok the service was great! I'd like to come back & sooner than a few years, because I know I've had good food here in the past. I think next time I need to order some pasta & definitely the pizza cookie!

I have been to Cherryblossom countless times for lunch over the past few years. I have to say the location kinda sucks, but that's because of all the traffic. Are they ever going to finish construction on Camelback?!   Any way, I decided to get a to go lunch order today. Since it was actually chilly out, I ordered the cha-shu ramen noodles with a couple of their yummy bread rolls & also picked up a slice of their amazing blueberry bread. The rolls were yummy as usual & I ate half of the cha-shu, so good & a big enough portion for me to have it again for lunch tomorrow.   Service can be slow there sometimes, it's best to go at 11am or after 1pm, to beat the lunch crowd. Other tasty items I have enjoyed here are: cali crunchy roll, double shrimp crunchy roll, grilled chicken salad (w/ginger dressing instead), calamari, edamame & I have tried a couple different pasta dishes which were surprisingly good!

I heart Tokyo Express. I have been coming here ever since I was a little girl, when I would come to work with my parents. Now that I am a big girl, I still come here about twice a month for lunch, sometimes 3-4.  I always order the same thing, teriyaki lite bowl with egg rolls. But today I decided to switch it up & I ordered bento box a. It was ok, the best parts were the teriyaki chicken & eggroll so I think I will just stick to my usual.  The 2 girls up front who take orders are always smiling & super sweet. I have never had to wait more than 5 mins for my order.  Like I said, I heart Tokyo Express!

For my 2nd birthday dinner I chose the Rokerij. My hubby & I met my parents there at 6:30pm this past Sunday. I was kinda bummed we didn't eat down stairs but the main dinning room was very cool so I wasn't too disappointed. Even though we had reservations, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Once seated, we had a big, comfy booth with throw pillows, next to the fire place. & I know some people don't care for it but I loved the dim lighting!   For starters we ordered the beef tenderloin toasts & calamari. The calamari was good but I didn't like the dipping sauce. It was too sweet, I prefer cocktail sauce. I'm pretty sure I said the beef toasts, not brie, but she brought out the brie. Still delicious but would have loved to try it with the beef. I would have said something but the service was so slow & our server disappeared for 10-20 minutes at a time. She seemed...high...on life maybe? Hmmm...   Any way, for our entrees: my mom ordered the chimayo chicken (Richardson's menu), my dad the prime rib (Rokerij menu), my hubby the garlic shrimp pasta (Richardson's menu) & I ordered one of the specials-a trio of fish: salmon, mahi mahi & swordfish. For sides: 2 meals came with a salad, 3 meals came with their famous green chile potato, 2 meals opted for asparagus & 1 opted for zucchini. My mom did not like her chicken at all but loved the salad & asparagus that came with. My dad liked how rare his steak was cooked but said the horseradish sauce on top ruined the taste for him, loved his zucchini though. My hubby loved his garlic shrimp pasta & salad. I loved my trio of fish & asparagus, so yummy! Those of us who got the GCP did not really care for it, we must be a group of wimps because we found it to be too spicy. Very creative side dish though!   Our total came to about $185, not including tip. We did have about 5-6 cocktails, plus 2 apps & 4 entrees. So I guess it wasn't too bad price-wise but my dad thought it was way too expensive. Maybe because he was footing the bill? Well, I think my hubs & I will come back for happy hour perhaps & I really want to check out the down stairs!

We came here today for lunch for my brother James' Bday.  The lighting is very dim inside which I liked. The decor is modern cowboy, not my style but the chairs we sat in were comfy.  There were 6 of us at the table & we all ordered the iced tea, expect my mom who always orders a sprite. We all agreed their iced tea was delicious. For our entrees: 3 ordered the Famous French Dip Au Jus, 2 ordered the Fresh Fish Sandwich & I ordered the Club Sandwich. All came with a side of "shoestring" cut fries. The French Dip was overall liked except one said his was a bit dry. The Fish Sandwich was the favorite among the entrees. My Club Sandwich was mediocre at best, nothing special. I'm not sure what the others thought (well besides my mom) but I loved the fries. I ate all of mine!  Overall this place is nice but the food is way over-priced. I think I would have enjoyed my meal more if I had ordered a steak or even a burger but I don't think I will be coming back to find out.

My Hubby & I have ordered take out from FP at least 20-30 times since we moved nearby about 2 years ago. We have yet to actually go inside, maybe 1 day, but honestly when we are craving Chinese food it's usually because we are too lazy to cook/go out so delivery is always our go to option. Plus they have free delivery!   We have ordered a variety of items from their menu but our favs are: cashew chicken (w/extra cashews), flamingo special chicken, egg fried rice, veggie chow mein, beef & broccoli & their egg rolls. You can't go wrong if you order any of them, yummy!!   Love you long time FP! :)

I came here for a mani/pedi several months ago because I had a coupon & then kinda forgot about it. Not because there was anything wrong with the place, I just stopped getting mani/pedis done so frequently.   A month ago I decided to try out a "Rock Star" mani/pedi from another nail salon & what I didn't realize beforehand was that I would need to keep getting fills. I stopped getting acrylics in high school because of the maintenance. Even though the gels I got are a lot better than acrylics, I just can't justify spending $ on my nails & toes every 2 weeks, when my natural nails look just fine.   So I went to Tammy's yesterday & had them remove the gels from my nails & toes & also got a pedi. I stopped by the night before to ask about removal & pricing (btw-it was $10 for removal) & the owner was nice enough to tell me about coupons they have on savvyshopper.com. I printed out a coupon for my pedi, awesome deal at only $16.99. I'm not sure if they forgot or if it is included with their pedis, but I wasn't charged extra for getting black tips & rhinestones across my big toes. Major bonus points!  Rosa was my nail tech & I thought she was very good, so much so that I made an appointment with her for next weekend to get a mani.  Oh & the salon, almost forgot to describe it. Well it's not much, VERY tiny space with about 5 spa chairs & about 5 nail stations. It is nice though & clean.

I never get any clothes dry cleaned, so this was my 1st experience at the cleaners.   I bought a new king sized comforter for our bed, but it was way too big for our washer & dryer so I decided to take it to the cleaners.   I believe this place is called $2.25 cleaners now, at least that's what the sign says. Any way, I decided to just do the regular laundry washing as opposed to dry cleaning, & it cost me $15. I dropped it off on a Saturday & was told it would be ready on Wednesday.   Our comforter was all pretty & clean & folded nicely in a plastic bag. It's black so there were still some fuzzies on it but with black that's hard to avoid. I might get it dry cleaned next time to see if there's a major difference, it would be an extra $7 to do so.

The hubby & I came here randomly on Sunday afternoon for some pizza & games. We placed an order for a large "werx" pizza, breadsticks, 2 drinks & $20 worth of tokens. Total was around $43 for everything. About 15 mins. later our food was ready. The pizza was tasty & piled high w/toppings. The breadsticks were yummy w/lots of garlic & butter. Even though we don't have kids we had a good time playing games. The "motion" game was so lame for 4 tokens, but I could def. see why kids would love it. We won about 570 tickets & got some candy w/them. Probably less than $5 worth, but hey it was fun!

I usually throw away those value pack coupon envelopes you get in the mail, but decided to look at them this time & see if I'd use any. I pulled out ones for the dry cleaners, zoo, a burger/hot dog joint & Red Devil.   Most of them were for dine in only but a couple were for delivery as well, so I used the one that was for a 16" cheese (toppings were an additional $1.25 each) & 20 wings for $21.95. I had looked at their website before ordering & the combo (pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers-but we skipped the onions) sounded delish so we got that with the NY mild wings. They don't have their desserts listed on their website so I asked the guy who placed our order & decided on the cannolis (1 for me, 1 for hubs). He said it would be a lil over an hour & to my surprise it arrived in 45 minutes.  The pizza was good, not Mamma Mia's good, but good! The wings were bomb; crispy, the right amount of sauce & they smelled amazing! The cannolis were pretty good but we didn't really prefer their "style". Instead of chocolate chips inside with the filling, the entire cannoli was dipped in chocolate.   Total with coupon, $3 delivery fee & tip was $47. Not bad at all considering we will each be getting 2 or more meals out of it. We're fans & would definitely order from them again...maybe even dine in eventually!

The 1st reviewer pretty much said it all, but here's my personal take. My hubby & I love It's All Goodz, our fav place to go piece shopping! We've bought multiple pieces over the years, which are all resting in pieces now, except our amazing bubbler from the "middle case" that we barely use in fear of it breaking like the rest eventually do. Any how, we stopped in this past Tuesday night for a new piece. It's been over a year since we last came here because we moved out of the area & had been checking out other places near us. We've always had good experiences but the guy we dealt with this time was a dick! He was so rude & made us feel like we were bothering him when we asked to look at a few different ones, sorry to make you get off the computer dude! That didn't affect my rating though, since this was the 1st time we encountered a douche bag employee. We ended up getting a pretty sweet piece that I should have taken a pic of! We'll be back for sure, just hope we don't have to deal with that guy again.

This place always smells so good walking by! Bath & Body Works is my go to gift spot when I don't know what to get someone. By someone I mean a woman, what girl doesn't love yummy scented bath products? They are a bit pricey, but usually have good deals where you can stock up, especially around the holidays. My fav items are the lil hand sanitizers, lil hand lotions (both good for my purse), candles & their hand soaps that look great in my kitchen. They have the best scents too, with warm vanilla sugar, vanilla noel (holiday special), coconut lime & country apple being some of my favs. I've been going here since HS, so I'm sure I'll be going here till I'm an old lady!

I came here Saturday at noon with my girl Brooke. I've been here once before, but over 5 years ago. It's a smaller nail salon, with about 5 or 6 pedi spa chairs & about 5 or 6 nail stations. I usually bring my own polish but this time I didn't because I wanted green & didn't have that color. Selection was decent but a lot of the bottles looked old, still found the color I was looking for though! My pedi was awesome & a good deal at $19 (plus $5 for colored tips & $5 for flowers, so $29 total). Brooke got a full set of acrylics with pretty, pink glitter tips for I believe $30-35. Wish I took a pic of her nails. FYI- If you're paying with a card you have to tip in cash. I'd definitely come here again!

I agree with Kirstin's entire review! I too followed them from their old location & have been going here for about 8 years now. The current location is very nice & clean. The girls up front are nice but Rosie is by far the sweetest. I used to see Dr. Silvia Castro for my annual but I think she has been pretty busy with her new baby & other patients, so for the past 2 years I have seen Gretchen. She is amazing! Such a sweetheart & really does take the time to listen to any questions or concerns you may have. My only gripe with my last appt on 1/4/11 was that I had to wait 45 minutes before I was seen. I understand things can get busy, especially at the beginning of the year, but it can get annoying to wait 3 times as long as your actual appt time itself.

I feel bad for the low rating b/c the lady who works the drive thru late nights has been there since my hubby & I were in HS & she is super sweet but ugh, I GOT FOOD POISONING HERE! It was 1am Christmas day, or the day after if you wanna get technical, and we were all hungry after some drinking & other 'festivities". Jack in the crack is 1 of the only places by us open 24 hours, so the boys went on a food run. That morning at about 5am I got so sick. I thought maybe it was the alcohol but I only had 2 glasses of wine & 1 glass of champagne, nothing crazy. When I couldn't stop throwing up that entire day, had the chills & body aches, my husband said it had to be food poisoning. I will never eat here again, or at least for a long time, no matter how hungry at 1am I am. All the pain I was in was not worth it!

I LOVE Victoria's Secret, I've been going to this location since high school. I haven't really had any major size issues like the other girls have stated. I do think that some of the girls that work here are bitches though. There are a couple who are nice & helpful but a majority are just rude & that does get super annoying.   I was here this past Saturday & bought 2 body by victoria push up bras, 1 in white stars & 1 in black. I got hooked on these bras when I bought 1 in nude dot a few months back, they are the most comfy push ups EVER! I had received a lil coupon card for $10 off any bra + a free panty (they send these cards like every couple months). Luckily the bras I got were buy 1 get 1 50% off, so I scored 2 for about $58. The free panty has me a lil worried though, it's a 1 size fits all thong, ugh. It was free though so I guess I can't complain. There were tons of colors to chose from & I picked the multicolored leopard.   It's the Holiday season, so they had their secret reward card worth up to $500, that you can start using Dec. 1st. I usually get the $10 one but hey I'll take it, any excuse to go shopping at VS!

I do not have any children but have shopped here for baby shower gifts several times over the years. Most recently I went this Saturday to get a gift for my girlfriend who is having her 2nd child, a girl this time. The registry print out machine wasn't working so the sweet lady working there printed it out for me. They make things easy to find by listing the aisle # next to the item. I got her these adorable monkey receiving blankets, a soft pink daisy blanket & a pack n play set in pink of course. My mom is someone who loves wrapping gifts so she wrapped them for me at their complimentary gift wrapping station. I could easily spend hours in this store, can you say baby fever?! I can't wait to be able to shop here for my lil one :)

I guess my review is sort of biased since my husband & I got married here last year, but here it goes!   About 2 weeks ago I contacted Allison (catering manager) about our complimentary room for our 1st anniversary. She booked the room & said it was all set, yay! We arrived at 4pm sharp this past Sunday. I love their lobby with it's automatic doors. The cookies they give you upon check-in are so good & warm too! I love that they have free parking also. We drove around to our room which was located on the 1st floor, I would have preferred the 2nd floor so our balcony was private, but oh well.   The rooms are nice & spacious. We love the wood beam ceilings. The counter tops at the wet bar & bathroom sink are nice, as well as the big, black framed mirrors. The beds were not my favorite because the mattress & pillows were "squishy" feeling, I like it more firm. My hubby however loved them. There is a decent sized flat screen tv & connection to wifi, although my husband tried to hook up his laptop & wasn't able to get on the internet. Maybe it's an extra charge? My only issue was with the shower, it's a rather tight fit, especially for 2 people & the hot water took a lil while to get going.   We ordered room service the night before for breakfast the next morning. I ordered a feast to say the least & with the $3 delivery charge, 21% gratuity & additional $4 tip I left, our breakFEAST was about $60. Holy shit...but what the hell it was our anniversary & the room was FREE!   When we checked out (at NOON!) the lovely gentleman at the front desk gave us 2 more cookies for the road, yum. We love the DoubleTree!

*This review is based on a quick styling appt only.*   I was at MAC getting my makeup done & told my artist, Chanel, that I really wanted someone to backcomb my hair so I had some volume & to put a flower clip in for me. She called Toni & Guy 1st but they were giving her a hard time, probably because it was so last minute, so she tried Regis next. They told her I could come in as soon as my makeup appt was done, score!   I raced over & saw Shayanne. She was a total sweetheart with rockin hair herself, so I knew I was in good hands. Less than 20 minutes later, a whole lot of hairspray & bobby pins, she was finished! I loved the volume & she placed the flower perfectly. The best part, she only charged me $10! I gave her a $10 tip & she more than deserved it. I would definitely see her again for any styling needs if I'm in the area!

For my dad's birthday last night my mom got all my siblings together for dinner. We had 9 in our party so we got our own table. About half of us started off with cocktails, I personally got their signature punch which was so delicious & very reasonable during hh for $5 (only at the bar though, not at the table). I don't know why they did, but my bro & mom ordered some apps for everyone, an assortment of tempura (shrimp, scallops & veggies) & edamame. Both were ok but cold, blech. Shortly after we received our soups & salads. The soup was pretty tasty but the salad was drenched in dressing. Everyone ordered something from the teppanyaki menu, except my sis who opted for sashimi & a couple sushi rolls, which she enjoyed. I can't recall what everyone else ordered but my hubby got rocky's choice (steak & chicken) & I got samurai treat (steak & shrimp).   Our chef Julio was nice enough but messed up on the tricks quite a few times, isn't that what we're paying for here? Regardless, we all had some laughs & it was fun. The food was ok. I ordered my steak med-rare & some parts were rare while others were pretty well done, not very consistent. They use so much oil & butter yet the food was flavorless, we had to use a lot of extra soy sauce & salt. I'd say the best food item was probably the fried rice, but again it needed extra soy sauce added. A couple of us ordered dessert after dinner, green tea & chocolate ice cream & banana tempura. The ice creams were ok, definitely store bought & seemed a lil old. I didn't try the banana tempura but those who had it said it was ok also. I almost forgot to mention, since it was my dad's birthday they sang to him (which he hated) & took a pic for him to take home (nice touch).  I didn't foot the bill but was informed that it was over $500 with tip! There were a few people in our party who had never been before so I'm glad they got to experience it, but when you compare the quality of the food to the price it just doesn't add up. Yes you get a show, but I care more about my food tasting good than some tricks. I would maybe come back for some of their punch during hh & fried rice, but that's about it.

I had bought the Groupon for 2 games plus shoe rental earlier last week & decided to use them towards cosmic bowling Saturday night (it stated on the Groupon that you could do so). I called Thursday to verify that all of us (4 ppl total) could each use a Groupon & the employee I spoke to said yes, I also reserved a lane just in case they were busy that night.  We got there around 9:30pm & thank goodness we reserved a lane because it was packed. I presented my Groupons & was told we couldn't use them towards cosmic bowling, WTF?! The manager came over & explained that they cannot use the Groupon coupon code with cosmic prices, I was pretty annoyed so he gave us a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free games. We bought 2 extra games & then headed over to our lane.   They had pretty good music playing & cool lighting. Idk if we just took our sweet ass time but we only got to play 3 of the 4 games. We had a lot of fun though! One thing that did kind of suck was that they closed at midnight, I am used to playing till 1am or later when we do cosmic. I almost forgot to mention the food/drinks. The soft pretzels with cheese were actually really good, as were the fries. The chicken fingers & grilled cheese were not as good, way too greasy. But it's bowling food so whatev! The pitchers of beer were $2 off so we got 2 for a lil under $15.   All in all it was a good time so we'd definitely return!

After we bought our 1st puppy together in 06, the groomer suggested we come to Sunburst for all her shots/check-ups. We also started bringing our 2nd puppy when we got him in 07. The staff here is great & they're always so happy to see our pups. I can't compare anything price-wise, since they're the only vets we've ever used, but to me they're fair. For example, we took both dogs for their annual shots this past Saturday & it was $108 for both, $54 each. It's a lil bit of a drive for us but we will continue to go to Sunburst because they really care about our doggies!

I hated KFC for the longest time. But a few months ago I needed to grab a quick lunch & went to the drive thru. I have been here 4 times total & I get the same thing every time, mashed potato bowl. I also get a biscuit & yesterday I got a lil parfait, strawberry. The cheese on top of the chicken pieces, corn, gravy & mashed potatoes was barely melted, yuck. The biscuit was pretty good & so was the parfait. Why only 2 stars? I've definitely experienced better!

I have been to Mi Patio a couple times in the past, but it has been a few years since then. After seeing so many positive reviews & recs on the place I knew I had to come back & refresh my memory of Mi Patio.   My dad & I came here for lunch this past Wednesday around noon. The parking lot was packed, that's always a good sign! I have to agree with Rand H, that the restaurant does have an odd shape to it. We were seated at a table that had a chair on one side & a booth on the other, I sat at the booth spot. Our table was kinda wobbly, definitely needed to stick a book or something under the table leg.   Chips & salsa were immediately brought out & soon after came our drink orders. The chips & salsa were pretty damn good & our server was very on top of refills. For our entrees: my dad ordered a bean & cheese burro & I ordered the baja spinach & feta cheese chimi, both came with a side of rice. Dad enjoyed his burro & ate about 3/4 of it, he didn't eat the rice though because he's more of a beans guys & is watching his carbs. I also enjoyed my chimi, very unique flavors, the rice was yummy & I finished it all. I had about half of my chimi left so I took it home to hubby, along with the rest of my dad's burro & his rice. Hubby said chimi was ok, rice was good & burro was his fav.   My next visit will for sure be sooner than a few years!

Over 3 weeks ago I was in a minor car accident. My mom had given me her 02' RX-300 Lexus a few months back & so my dad suggested I call the dealership to see if I could get an estimate done there or if they had any good recs. They suggested Scott's Coach Works, so I called them right away. I brought my car in the next day & was given a quick estimate by Matt. After speaking with the other person's insurance company, I dropped my car off at Scott's to start the repair work.  Fast forward to yesterday when I picked my baby up. She looked so pretty! They did an excellent job fixing up the scratches & dents on my passenger side door. The paint looked amazing as well, I was told metallic was a harder color to do & they did a great job. Another thing, they detailed & washed my car before I came to get it, how awesome. They also give you a brochure/paperwork with their warranty, very classy & appreciated.  There are a couple repairs I need to make on my car & I will not hesitate to use Scott's again!

I love Discount Tire! My dad has been a loyal customer of this location for over 10 years, so naturally whenever my parents, siblings or I need new tires we go here. Yesterday a coworker noticed that I had a nail in my tire. I went straight to DT & they removed the 3 nails in my tire, patched it up & made sure none of my other tires had any nails. ALL FOR FREE! I was in & out within an hour, with about 4 people ahead of me. They have excellent customer service here which keeps my family & I coming back!

I was looking for something quick & cheap for lunch today. I saw a sign for Little Caeser's & stopped inside. I got a large hot & ready pepperoni pizza with an order of crazy bread & dipping sauce for only $8. The pizza wasn't bad, I've definitely had worse. The crazy bread was awesome. I'd come here again for lunch if I was in a hurry & didn't want to spend much.

I have been to Fuddruckers a million times since I was a kid. My dad loves it, so when I come here it's usually with him.  Their burgers are pretty damn good. I have tried the buffalo & it was ok but I will stick with beef. I have also had the grilled chicken sandwich & the salmon filet sandwich. The grilled chicken is bomb but the salmon filet was nasty. Their regular fries & onion rings are great but the sweet potato fries suck, if you want yummy sweet potato fries go to Fez! They also have some delicious shakes & baked treats if you still have room.  This isn't the cleanest location I've been to, but the staff is friendly & I love the condiment & toppings station.

My hubby likes it here for some reason. I prefer Tokyo Express for a chicken teriyaki bowl any day! Not that the bowls we got here last Saturday afternoon were bad, they just weren't very good.

After some shopping at Norterra my husband was in the mood for a sub. He saw a sign for Jersey Mike's & headed over. When we got closer we saw the "coming soon" part. Haha, he was bummed. Then I used my handy Yelp app on my phone & found Mr. Goodcents, which is only a couple miles from our house. We got there a lil after 7 & there were a couple people ahead of us in line. I decided on the Nickle sub which had capicola ham, pepperoni & salami. I got the 8 inch on white & added  provolone cheese, lettuce, pickles & mustard. Hubby ordered the Penny sub which had turkey, ham & roast beef. He got the 12 inch on white & added swiss cheese, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pepperoncinis & oil & vinegar. We both got combos with drinks, but I got a cookie & he got chips. Total for both meals was a lil over $15. The subs were very fresh & tasty, we'll definitely be back!

I had been craving a bean & cheese burrito all weekend, so on Monday come lunch time I searched my Yelp app for a Mexican food place on the way home (I was meeting up w/my hubs). Caramba was the 1st place to pop up so I decided to check it out. After looking over the menu I ordered the following for us to try: bean & cheese burrito, chicken pollo fundido, beef fajita combo plate & a cheese quesadilla w/a side of sour cream. Since I was taking it to go I forgot to grab some salsa from the salsa bar, next time!  I had half of the bean & cheese burro & about a third of the pollo fundido for my lunch, I can't decide which was better as they were both so good! My hubby split the bean & cheese burro w/me & ate the cheese quesadilla w/sour cream, he also loved the burro & said the quesadilla was good too, not greasy like most places. That night for dinner I finished my pollo fundido & my hubby had his fajita plate, he said everything was very tasty! Total for all that food was about $25, not bad.   Next visit I'd like to dine in & order their famous stuffed quesadilla & the cinnamon crisps dessert. They also have beer & margaritas & serve breakfast burritos all day. So glad I found this place!

I have been going here for about 2 years now. The staff is friendly & Dr. Yohannes is a really great guy. The office is very clean & nicely decorated, with flat screens in every room. I believe they are even open on weekends & will open their doors after hours if you have an emergency. I really like it here & will continue to go here as long as I can. It also helps that they are a block away from my house, so I leave literally a minute before my appointment time.

I bought a Groupon for Sunday brunch a while back & decided to finally use it for Mother's day. I made reservations a couple days prior for my parents, hubby & myself at noon. Surprisingly we arrived before my parents & were seated at a table in the open dining area.  I started off with a glass of milk (skim) while my hubby opted for dr. pepper. FYI- they only have bottled sodas, cute but at $6 a pop too damn expensive! My parents arrived & my dad started off with a bloody mary & my mom got her usual sprite, hers may have been a tad cheaper at $4 but still ridiculous. They really should invest in a soda fountain, just sayin. For apps we ordered the quesadilla (which had bacon, onions, potatoes & cheese with a delicious drizzle) & the bruschetta. The quesadilla was amazing, I wish I ordered 2 more for my entree! The bruschetta was just ok. For our entrees: dad & hubs ordered the breakfast enchiladas, mom ordered their signature mushroom dish & I ordered the fried egg & bacon sandwich. The boys enjoyed their enchiladas, mom didn't care for her mushroom dish & my sandwich was just ok. Disappointed with my entree I wanted to order dessert, but no one else did so I opted for a bag of their chocolate & bacon caramel popcorn to take home. I loved the popcorn, the sweet with a lil bit of salt from the bacon was such a yummy combo.  What annoyed me about this place were the prices, even with my $30 coupon our total came out to $87 (not including tip). Not too bad, about $30 per person, but my dad was the only person who got cocktails (2) & the food was pretty average at best. I'm glad I finally tried this place out but I don't think I'll be returning.

MY 100TH REVIEW-WOOHOO!   I was a lil excited there haha, but I saved this particular review for my 100th because my husband & I went here to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary! So it's pretty special, to me. Any way...   We arrived on Sunday, December 12th, at 8pm. We were seated in a booth overlooking Camelback mountain, it was gorgeous! I loved the whole look & feel of the restaurant, just an overall great ambiance & atmosphere.   We started out with the braised mussels & chorizo in spiced moroccan lobster broth, an amazing app! We then decided to order a couple cocktails, hubs ordered the jaded pear & I ordered the strawberry lavender royale. Very pretty drinks but we didn't care for either. For our entrees; my husband ordered the slow braised beef short ribs that came with anson mills aged cheddar grits, asparagus & mushroom ragu & I ordered the pan roasted free range chicken that came with roasted garlic mash, creamed spinach & sweet onion pancetta jus. Both meals were absolutely phenomenal! We were much too full for dessert so we passed, but a few minutes later our sweet server brought us a yummy chocolate/peanut butter dessert & wished us a happy anniversary. I wish I knew the name of it, but I can assure you, it was decadent & divine.   Total with tip was about $145. Pricey, but completely worth it in my opinion. I would love to return for our 2nd anniversary!

I went here about a month ago with my dad after seeing someone suggest this place on good old facebook.  It has a modern, funky vibe to it. My work is very casual so I wear a t-shirt & jeans everyday, I felt a bit underdressed with all the business attire I saw around me.   I ordered the shrimp kisra, it was AMAZING!! This thing was huge, about 10-12 slices so I only ate half, maybe less, & brought the rest home for dinner. My hubby loved it also! My dad ordered the rosemary chicken sandwich with a side salad, he said it was just ok. I brought his leftovers home also & my hubs said it was pretty good.  I definitely will be coming back to this place, especially to try the sweet potatoe fries everyone on here raves about!

I had to boost my rating up to 5 stars, Fez is the shiznit!  I took my childhood friend, Jacinthe, here today for lunch because she was in town from Vegas for a couple days & had never been here, which surprised me because she's from Phoenix.  We got there around 12:30 & it was packed! Our sweet & bubbly waitress took our drink order right away while we looked over the menu. I was tempted to get the shrimp kisra again but I thought "no, I must try something different"! I got the half order of the strawberry/blueberry cashew salad with chicken & Jac got the half order of the tomato taza salad with salmon. We also shared a basket of the cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries. The salads were amazing, so fresh & tasty & the chicken/salmon were grilled perfectly. The sweet potato fries; OH EM GEE-hands down the best I've ever had!! Oh & the aioli dipping sauce that came with, delish!  Our total came to $34 & some change, seems a bit high for lunch but it really is worth it for the quality of food. I can't wait to come back for dinner/cocktails & even though I never go out for it, their brunch menu sounds awesome. I love you Fez!!!

I know, I know. This is my 2nd update, but I tried pretty much all new menu items so I had to share!   I came here Wednesday night for dinner with my sister (not actually my sis but have been friends since we were 2 years old so pretty much!) & we arrived a lil before 8. Michelle was our server & what a doll! She chatted with us, recommended her favs & was all around one of the sweetest girls I've ever met.   We started off with a basket of fries, half sweet potato & half garlic & rosemary. So delicious! I ordered a G Spot cocktail & Jacinthe opted for a glass of the Screw Kappa Napa Cabernet Sauvignon. The G Spot was easily my new fav & Jac loved the wine & it's cute name. For our entrees I ordered the apricot salmon & Jac ordered the lemon caper tilapia. We tried each others meals & agreed we liked the tilapia better, we didn't really care for the sweet glaze on the salmon. The pistachio cous cous that came w/the salmon & the sauteed organic spinach that came w/the tilapia were the winners for the sides. Being the good wifey that I am, I ordered my hubby a burger to go. I chose the all american, hold the spreads, & added bacon & an order of fries. He loved the burger but said the fries were just ok, which was fine w/me because I finished them the next day for him. Finally, we had to get dessert. We both love creme brulee so we got the flavor of the day which was vanilla. It was a pretty big serving, enough for the 2 of us, and we devoured the entire thing.   Our total came to $95 & some change, not including tip. It was a bit more than we expected, but we did order 3 drinks total, an app, 3 entrees & dessert, so I'd say that it was worth it for the amazingness that is Fez!

I've been to Sierra Bonita a couple times in the past, but most recently last week for lunch. My bro & dad go here once a week for lunch & I happened to join them on their weekly visit. They both ordered the smoked turkey club sandwich, 1 with a side of beans & 1 with a side of asparagus. I opted for the buttermilk chicken which comes with sides of mashed chipotle sweet potatoes & asparagus. My dad & bro enjoyed their sandwiches & all was devoured. My chicken & sides were very tasty & at a smaller lunch portion I almost cleaned my plate. I can't comment on the total since I didn't foot the bill, but I believe it was under $50, including drinks but not including tip.

My hubby & I aren't the biggest BBQ fans but Bobby Q is definitely a fav of ours! I have been here a few times for lunch with my dad & the engineering company I used to work for would always order it in for lunch meetings. Last night I wasn't in the mood to cook dinner so I called in a to go order & used my $50 gc I got for my bday, thx bro!  I ordered the following for the Mr. & I: q-rolls (app), smokehouse burger (no bbq sauce-add mustard) with shoestring fries, half rack of back baby ribs with mac & cheese & potato salad & for dessert their homemade mud pie. Oh & it also came with 4 pieces of cornbread & I bought a bottle of their BBQ sauce.   The q-rolls were so freakin good, the chipotle dip that comes with is delish! My hubs said his burger was just ok but loved the fries. My ribs were fall off the bone tender & the mac & cheese was yummy. I didn't have room for the potato salad, but I've had it before & it's always good. I have to say their cornbread is so amazing, possibly the best I've ever had! The mud pie was just ok, the cookie crust had a weird taste & they used vanilla & chocolate ice cream, I prefer it with mocha. My hubby however, thought it was very good.   We'll definitely be back whenever we have a craving for some delicious BBQ!

My sister wanted to have a girls night out this past Saturday so I decided this was the perfect opportunity to try out Ticoz. We were seated at a high top table across from the bar. Our server was a sweet & patient dude, wish I remembered his name!   For starters we each ordered a margarita & the calamari rings. I thought the margs were tasty (I ordered a passion fruit & a strawberry) but my sis thought otherwise, she didn't even finish hers, bummer. However, we both agreed that the calamari rings were amazing. The best part: the jalapeno lime sauce that came with! After chatting for probably over an hour (my sis is a talker!), we finally decided on our entrees. Traci ordered the grilled peach salad with chicken & I ordered the RPM kitchen bowl with chicken (RPM= rice, pinto beans & meat). Traci loved her salad & devoured the entire thing! I too loved my entree, all the flavors went together so well! We were both stuffed but being the dessert junkie I am I had to order dessert to go. I went with the creme brulee, flavor of the day was butterscotch. When I got home later that night I dug in & it was just ok. I didn't really get a strong butterscotch flavor, which is what I was looking for.   I would definitely come back again, specifically for happy hour!

My hubby & I came her for lunch about 2 weeks ago.  I could tell from the building that this place had been around for a while. The tables had random business advertisements on them. Definitely different, but kinda cool.  I ordered the grilled cheese & opted for both the bacon & ham on sourdough bread with fries. My hubs got  the turkey melt on sourdough bread with fries. My sandwich was pretty yummy, hubs not so much. The fries were ok, nothing above average.  The other lunch options didn't look too exciting so I don't think I would come here for lunch again but from the other reviews maybe for breakfast? We shall see!

After some shopping at Smeeks, I stopped by here just to browse. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday afternoon but Christmas is only 4 days away! They have some really cute & unique jewelry, that's where I spent most of my time browsing. I ended up finding an adorable necklace that would match these earrings I bought a couple days ago. I then thought I should find something for my mama, but wasn't having any luck. A sales associate asked if I needed any help & I told her I was looking for jewelry for my mom & that she was really into purple right now. She showed me these really pretty purple & gold bracelets that could go with so many different outfits. I bought 2 purple & 1 gold, I hope she likes them! Just as I was about to ring up my items, I saw the cutest headband with a beautiful rhinestone applique. I had to have it! Total for 3 bracelets, necklace & headband was $109...pretty freakin pricey but such cute stuff! Oh & I almost forgot to mention, they put my mama's bracelets in a cute lil box with red ribbon, love it!

I took my Hubby here for his 25th Birthday last night & we were both blown away by Ocean Club. Hands down, one of the best meals we've ever had, period.   We made reservations for 5:30pm because Entourage was premiering at 7:30pm & we couldn't miss it. It was nice having the place pretty much to ourselves, there were only about 3 or 4 other parties around us. I liked the dim lighting & the chairs were comfy. Our server Eric was very friendly & answered any questions we had regarding the menu/food.   The bread basket was promptly brought out with our glasses of water. Most of the breads were hard as rocks but were pretty good. The best bread (& softest) was the pretzel bread, I wish we got a basket of only that, it was so good! We aren't fancy drinkers so we didn't order martinis (although I kinda wish I did). Hubs ordered a couple Captain & cokes & I ordered a Vodka (Grey Goose) cranberry. You definitely get your alcohol's worth here, more than 3/4 of the drinks were pure alcohol. For an appetizer we ordered the Vanilla battered shrimp. It was only 3 pieces, but they were HUGE. The outside coating reminded me of funnel cake you get at the fair. Sounds gross with shrimp but it was so delicious, & the dipping sauce it came with was so tasty! For our entrees, my Hubs ordered the Alaskan King crab legs & I ordered the Ivory salmon. For our sides we ordered the sauteed asparagus & Mastro's mashed potatoes. The crab legs were so fresh & they even cracked them for him. The meat was so sweet & tender, my Hubby polished off the whole pound! The salmon was just as good, so fresh & cooked perfectly. This was my 1st experience with white salmon & I must say I might like it even more than pink. The sides were delicious as well, the asparagus were cooked & seasoned perfectly & the mashed potatoes were just right with all the bacon goodness! We were both stuffed beyond belief but being the dessert junkie I am I had to order the Butter cake that everyone raves about. WOW, so sinfully good! It was so moist with the perfect little crunch on top.   Like others have stated, it is pretty pricey. Our total came to about $180 (I think they threw in the Butter cake for free since it was Hub's Bday-nice!) but it was more than worth it! We will definitely come back for a special occasion & most likely my Hubby's 26th Birthday!!

I bought a few restaurant.com gc's & Feeney's was one of them. I have never been here, let alone heard of this place, but I checked it out on Yelp & the reviews were positive so I thought why not?!   We arrived at about 8pm this past Saturday. It wasn't busy but it wasn't dead either, I would say there were about 10 other parties there maybe more. From the looks of the building & decor it seemed that Feeney's had been around for quite some time, definitely had character.   For starters we ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms & I ordered a couple cocktails (strawberry vodka w/cranberry juice-yum!). The app was pretty good but it lacked flavor. I have to say Red Lobster's version is better. For our entrees, my hubby ordered the king crab legs & I ordered the filet medalions. You can't really go wrong w/crab legs, hubby loved them! I had a bite & the meat was sweet & very fresh. I am never one to clean my plate, but I finished my entire entree! The meat was cooked perfectly (medium-rare) & the mashed potatoes/asparagus were delicious as well. I wish I had received more asparagus though, only 2 pieces were given. Oh & I almost forgot, our meals came with their famous salad bar. Our salads were pretty good but kinda boring. I thought there would be more of a wow factor there but it wasn't a disappointment or anything since I am not really a "salad person". After devouring our meals we were stuffed but I wanted dessert for later so I ordered their mud pie to go. It was pretty standard but damn it was good. Chocolate cookie crust, mocha ice cream & chocolate ganache-freakin delish!   With the $25 gc our total came to about $70 (including tip). Not cheap, especially for the area, but I have to say it was pretty good! We would definitely come back, I am curious to try their $4 burger special on Mondays.

Have been here several times in the past few years. Most recent trip was Friday night with a couple girlfriends. I had a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com & decided to use it, such an awesome deal!   We started out with some drinks. I had a strawberry Patron margarita & it was tasty. Jessica had some cocktail with Sweet Tea vodka & it was so good. Vanessa had a Michelob Ultra, can't go wrong there. Their chips & salsa are standard but pretty good. We all ordered way too much food, I think we were more in the mood to drink than eat (we were heading out to the bars afterwards). For dinner: Vanessa ordered their cheese crisp with chicken, Jessica ordered their bean & cheese burrito & I ordered their chicken chimichanga. The portions were HUGE so we left with 3 FULL to go containers. Oh & I forgot her name, but our server was so sweet & not at all bitchy about me using the g.c.   Overall, I like Valle Luna & will continue to come here for some yummy Mexican food!

I went with my Hubby today for lunch & had to write my review as soon as I got back to work.  I have to admit, this place intrigued me because of the "mention Yelp & receive 20% off" offer. And I am so glad I decided to try it out!  Fuego Bistro is hidden away inside an older looking complex. The inside is very small but they do have additional space in the patio out front.  Our waitress, Suzie I believe, was very sweet! She was very good about refilling our drinks & asked how everything was.  For my entree I ordered their Signature Empanadas & for my Hubby's entree he ordered the Fuego Enchiladas, both came with a side of rice & black beans. The empanadas were so delicious, there were so many flavors going on it was amazing. Hubs said his enchiladas were delicious as well, some of the best he's ever had. I had to order the Captain Morgan Banana Burrito for dessert even though it was lunch time. I am SO glad I did, it was one of the BEST desserts I've ever had & I am a dessert junkie.  They have a rather large bar for such a small space so I definitely want to come back for happy hour & dinner sometime. This is my new favorite place!

We have been here once before over 5 years ago, so I thought it would be nice to come here for my birthday dinner. We had reservations for this past Saturday at 8pm. When we arrived we were promptly seated at a two-person booth, kinda small but just right for the two of us.  For an app we ordered the grilled artichokes. They were good but not great, would have preferred less leaves & more hearts. I also ordered a cocktail, the Flirtini, it was so tasty! For our entrees my hubs ordered the stacked chicken enchiladas with a side of rice & I ordered the ruby red trout with a side of mashed potatoes. My hubby liked his enchiladas but said he's had better. I loved my trout & so did my hubby because he helped me finish my plate. The herb goddess sauce that came with it was delish as well. The mashed potatoes were ok, definitely not "freshly mashed"-more like from a box! But the "good gravy" that came with it was indeed good. For dessert I ordered the bread pudding with ice cream. This thing was HUGE & oh so yummy! I took it home & bought some more ice cream & devoured it.   Our total came to about $85 (including tip), not bad at all! We would definitely come back.

We stayed at the Valley Ho 3 years ago for my hubby's birthday, when I saw a special they were running back in May I knew I had to book a room for his birthday this year. I booked a studio room, which is a bit larger than the signature room & also has an amazing bathtub. I discovered that they allow dogs, so we had to bring our lil maltese Angel with us! Upon entering our room I noticed a doggy bowl with food & water & lil pink bags to pick up her you know what, I thought that was a nice touch. We had dinner reservations, but not for another couple hours, so we ordered some food. From Cafe ZuZu we got the grilled cheese that came with house made chips, onion rings & 2 cokes. The grilled cheese was yummy, as were the chips. The onion rings were more like onion strings & not something I'd order again. Total (including a 20% tip) was about $27, not too bad for room service. The beds & pillows are so comfy, as are the over sized robes! We love the retro feel with some modern twists, such as the sink & lighting fixtures. The shower & tub are great & big enough for 2 (or 3 if you're into that). The bathroom amenities are nice too, red flower brand. The flat screen tvs are nice as well with free (?) wi-fi. The balconies are nice & big too with a padded lounge chair & small table with 2 chairs. I have had dinner twice at Trader Vic's in the past & enjoyed it. I would like to try out their spa next time. I look forward to future staycations at the Ho!

After picking up my car from the body shop, I decided to get myself a lil treat. Urban Cookies came to mind since it has been one of my bookmarks for a few months now. Since this was my 1st visit here I tried a lil bit of everything; cookies- simple (chocolate chip), snickerdoodle & the April special peanut butter, a bag of 6 perfectly sized brownies & a brown velvet cupcake. I sampled the simple & snickerdoodle & both were delish, I had the entire pb cookie & it was so yummy. I also had a brownie & it was super soft but almost too rich. The winner of the bunch was definitely the brown velvet, OMG was that cupcake amazing! I am not a big frosting fan, but I could have ate this cream cheese frosting by the spoonful. Total for 3 cookies, bag of brownies & 1 cupcake was about $19. Next time I am getting a dozen brown velvet cupcakes, that I may or may not be sharing...

I am a big fan of Edible Arrangements! They are just as pretty as flowers, but you get to eat them too. I've ordered a few bouquets in the past, both chocolate covered & plain fruit (see photos). Last week was national dipped fruit week & all stores were selling boxes normally priced $25 for $10, so I got 2. I would prefer just strawberries & green apples, but got a variety of fruits in my boxes (see photo). Delivery can be a bit pricey, I'm glad they are so close to my house, that way I can just pick them up myself. With my last order I got a couple $5 off coupons, I think I'll order my mom a bouquet for her birthday next month!

I like Pei Wei. I have been to this location about 10 times & the down town location about 3 times. I usually order the honey seared chicken with white rice, it's yummy! Their edamame isn't bad either. My hubby likes their pork egg rolls & mongolian chicken. One item I did not care for were the crab wontons, I also didn't care for their sweet & sour sauce that came with them. Last night when I picked up a to go order, the manager informed me they were out of chocolate chip cookies, I had ordered one with my online order. So he kindly gave me a $10 gc & told me to come back for a chocolate chip cookie on the house, now that is awesome customer service! I will definitely keep returning.

I have been to this CVS like a million times, it's literally a 30 sec drive from mi casa. I think most of the cashiers know me & my hubby since we go here so much, for anything & everything from Captain Morgan/Sailor Jerry's for him to yummy scented body wash for me. I like how they have coupons at the end of each receipt & the occasional extra bucks-woohoo!   They are affiliated with J C Penney, so I use my Penney's card here 90% of the time & the other 10 is actually at J C Penney.

My mom was raving about the grilled artichoke app she had here & said my hubby & I had to join her & my dad for dinner sometime. We went on Friday night at 7:30. The place wasn't busy but it wasn't dead either. The decor is pretty dated & not really my style, but I did like the taller booths for added privacy.   My dad started off with a martini (which is so unlike him), my hubby opted for an appletini, I decided to try the cowboy sangria & my mom got a virgin pina colada. The boys enjoyed their martinis (hard to mess those up), mom also enjoyed her pina colada & my sangria was pretty good (too many seeds from the blackberries though). My hubby & I also tried their cranberry iced tea, he didn't like it but I did & drank both of ours. The bread & butter they bring out is yummy, I believe it was a pumpernickel. For an app we tried the grilled artichokes my mom kept talking up (she even ordered 1 to have with her entree, so that's 3 total!). 3 halves came on 1 order with a couple mayo-based dipping sauces, all I tasted was the mayo so I didn't care for them. The artichokes were pretty good but the server who brought them out told us that they grill them ahead of time & then microwave them before they bring them out, ew. My parents shared the steak & lobster special, dad chose the 8oz top sirloin (med-rare) & upgraded to the 9-10oz lobster tail for $3 more. For sides they chose the wedge salad & baked potato. Hubby went with the steak & seafood & had the filet mignon (med) with fried shrimp, for sides he chose the wild rice & broccoli. I decided on the 6oz bacon wrapped filet mignon (med-rare), with the garlic mashed potatoes & broccoli. The lobster was bland & needed seasoning, the sides were all generic tasting & my steak was very rare (dad's was also but he enjoys bloody red, I prefer more of a pink). For dessert we all split the chocolate fudge cake. It was seriously enough for 6 people it was huge, but pretty good.   Total (not including tip) was about $160, which isn't bad considering all the food & drinks we ordered, but the food was boring & tasteless. Service was great though, which is why I gave 2 stars, the food deserved only 1!

How are there no reviews for the MAC store yet?!   I have had my makeup done at 3 different locations: here (twice), Nordstroms & at PV mall. This by far is my fav location. Most recently, I had my makeup done for our 1st wedding anniversary. My appt was at 5pm & the talented Chanel was my artist. She asked what I was wearing that night for dinner & if I'd like to incorporate those colors into my look. I told her I wanted purple to be the main hue & that I wanted to focus on my eyes with dramatic lashes & go with just a light gloss on my lips.   I swear every artist, & even some customers, who saw me while she was working her magic said it looked amazing! I am not a big makeup girl so I was a lil shocked at 1st but after a couple minutes, & getting used to all the makeup, I LOVED how it turned out!   For a makeup application you have to buy $50 worth of product. I'm lucky if I spend that much, it's usual around $100 for me. I bought the lashes, lipgloss, blush, a set of 5 brushes & she even threw in blot powder for me for FREE because mine broke. Such an awesome chic! To top it off, I was wanting someone to do my hair, nothing over-the-top like an updo, just a lil backcombing & add my flower clip for me. Well Chanel called Regis & got me in right after my appt with her. What AMAZING customer service!  Whenever I want/need my makeup professionally done, there's no doubt I will make an appt with MAC!

This was my 3rd time coming to this location in about a year. I came with my friend Jess after a movie. We both got the caramel brulee frappucino. She got the chocolate croissant & I wanted to try the vanilla bean scones but they were out, again. So I got the marshmallow dream bar & iced lemon pound cake. This was my 1st time eating outside though. The tables were all a bit dirty but it was a nice day to sit outside & chat for a lil.   I docked a star for being out of stuff & the outside tables being dirty.

I am not a coffee person at all, but their passion fruit tea with lemonade is so freakin good! Every couple months or so me & my hair stylist come here while my hair color is setting, so yes I have come here more than once with foils all over, I'm cool like that. Besides that yummy drink mentioned above they have awesome treats like these mini birthday cake donuts, marshmallow dream bar, iced lemon pound cake & the cashier lady told us their vanilla bean scones were to die for. If I am in the mood for them, I also do enjoy the caramel & vanilla bean frappucinos.

I had my car washed here over the weekend & I was pleasantly surprised.   I was confused on how to get in exactly & an employee came over to me & pointed me in the right direction, thanks dude! Once I got my car in I let the dude know I had been on a couple road trips so there was a bug graveyard on the front of my car. There was a special going on for their full wash & interior cleaning plus a tire shine for about $25. Sweet deal & he didn't even push for me to get an extended package, unlike Cobblestone employees who push way too much of that shit on you.   The waiting area was pretty small but it has some high top tables & chairs & the ac was blasting. There was a good amount of people there but my car was ready in about 20-30 minutes.   I will definitely be back & more often than every 6 months...because my car sure does look pretty when she's all nice & clean! :)

I have been wanting to go to St. Francis ever since I heard about it, on the radio of all places, a few months back. I decided it was the perfect day to check it out, my hubby offered to take me out to lunch today for my birthday (he's a keeper!), so this was my choice.   I LOVE the architecture of the building, so much eye candy! We asked our server what used to be in this building & she told us it was an old Dentist office. The bathrooms were so cool! I love that the toilet paper roll was on a rod coming out of a safe on the wall & the flat sink was so interesting.   We arrived right at noon & the place was almost full, with about 2-3 tables available. The hostess promptly sat us & we gazed over the menu. Hubs ordered his usual Dr. Pepper, since it was my bday I ordered a cocktail. My 1st ever mojito! It was made with mint of course, lime & pineapple rum. Not a drink I would order often but I liked it, very refreshing! For an app we ordered the baguette with olive oil. It came out sliced, about 7 pieces, with a tiny cup of olive oil. Tasty! For our entrees hubby ordered the turkey & avocado sandwich & I ordered the pork chile verde. He said his sandwich was just ok but I loved my stew! It had so much yummy flavor & the cornbread that came on the side was fabulous!! Using the bday card again, I decided to order some dessert. I ordered the chocolate cake; which came with peanut butter gelato, caramel & caramel corn. It was delicious! The only reason i couldn't finish it was because I was already full from lunch & I ran out of gelato, I always mess up the cake to ice cream ratio!   The hostess came by to ask how our meal was & I told her it was excellent & that I was glad to have finally tried it out on my bday. She then told our server it was my bday so she took the dessert off of our tab. That was so sweet of them! So total with tip & minus dessert was about $45. A little pricey for lunch but totally & completely worth it in my opinion! We will definitely be back for dinner sometime :)

I freakin love Costco! Since moving to this area over 2 years ago, I am very familiar with this location. My mom & I come here once every 2-3 months & stock up. They have an awesome meat selection! Love getting toilet paper & paper towels in bulk, as well as any cleaning supplies or personal hygiene items. Usually always get water bottles & a case of Dr. Pepper too. The alcohol is a bit cheaper as well so whenever we have a party or get-together we stop by Costco for the booze & sandwich trays/pizza. It's so hard not to spend a ton here though, yesterday we walked out with a $350 total! SOOO worth it though.

Our friend's girlfriend wanted to surprise him by having a few of us meet them & their kids here for his bday this past Saturday. We decided to meet at the bowling alley & bowl for a couple hours.   It was pretty early, around 5:30pm, so we skipped ordering food & went straight for drinks. The kids (there were 6 total, ages 2-8) all got their sodas & chocolate milk, while the adults all got beer. Well except me, I tried their candy shop cocktail, it was yummy but I could barely taste any alcohol, so I went with double vodka cranberries instead. These lanes sucked! I am by no means a pro, but I was shittier than usual here. The things that come down after you roll your ball down the lane would do so before my ball even reached the pins, causing some pins that should have been knocked over to stay up. Pretty annoying! The cost is $25 per hour & $3 for shoes, you can fit up to 12 people in 1 lane so it's a fair deal.   After bowling we went up stairs to the arcade area to let the kiddies play some more. My hubby & I were the only ones there without any little ones so we were bored pretty quickly. We were getting hungry so I ordered him a philly cheese steak (came with fries) & myself the soft pretzel bites. Hubs said his sandwich was ok, fries were good & my pretzel bites were pretty good, the dipping sauces sucked though.   Overall, I'm sure this is a fun place to take your kids but for us it was just ok & way overpriced. I'd rather eat somewhere else in the future & come here for games (not bowling though) only, especially on Wednesdays when they have half priced games & during happy hour would help too.

My mom & I stopped in here for lunch Saturday afternoon. This place kind of reminded me of Chipotle, very industrial looking. After scanning the menus posted on the wall, she went for the balsamic portabella sandwich & I got the special which was a slice of pizza (I went with pepperoni) & a side salad. My mom loved her sandwich & my salad/pizza combo was delish, I also loved their berry green tea. Total for our meals plus drinks was about $20, not bad. We will definitely be back!

I have been wanting to try this place out for a few months now, so finally last Friday my mom & I decided to come here for lunch.   When you walk in your eyes are immediately drawn to all the goodies in the bakery case. But we were here for lunch so we brought our attention back to that. We were seated in the dining room that was pretty empty, there were only 3 other parties. After scanning the menu we ordered the following to share: lumpia (crunchy pork eggrolls), pancit (rice noodles w/veggies & chicken that came w/puto-a sweet rice bread) & ginatang sitao kalabasa (string beans, squash & shrimp sauteed in coconut milk w/rice). The lumpia was amazing, so yummy! The pancit was delicious as well, great flavor. The veggie dish was my least favorite, however my mom loved it. Oh I also did not care for the puto.   After we finished lunch we looked at all the treats again & decided to order some to go. I can't recall what my mom got but I got the following: cannoli, flan, cheese roll & siopao (steamed bbq bun). The cannoli was for my hubby & he enjoyed it. The flan was yummy but had a much thicker consistency than I am used to. I did not care for the cheese roll at all, I think if the cream cheese had some sugar added to it it would be much better. I had the siopao for lunch today & it was pretty good.   After chatting with the owners (very sweet, husband & wife) we found out they offer line dancing every Saturday for $8. My mom loves to dance & is going to check it out this Saturday with a couple girlfriends. If she has fun I might even join her next time!

I have been to Sushi Brokers twice now. My 2nd time was today for their 4-6:30pm happy hour.  My girl Jessica & I got there around 5:15. I think we just beat the dinner rush because by the time we left around 7:30 it was pretty packed.  Our server Jessica was a sweetheart & good about checking on us. We had all our rolls on the table in about 10-15 mintues.  We started off with bombers. Yum! For our rolls we ordered: crunchy, philly, vegas & chimichanga. We also ordered a piece each of the yellowtail hamachi. Everything was so yummy, we almost finished it all.  For happy hour it was still a little pricey but not too bad. Our total was $59 not including tip.   Definitely will be back for more sushi dates with my girls!

The hubs & I loved Barro's back when we 1st started dating & it was pretty much the only place we would get pizza from. After a while we got kinda burnt out on it & didn't order from them for quite some time. Last weekend I was in the mood for pizza & decided to call Barro's. I ordered us 2 large pizzas, 1 w/pepperoni & 1 w/ham & double pineapple, I also got 2 sides of ranch & a 2 liter of dr. pepper. About 45 minutes later our pizzas arrived hot & fresh. I usually prefer a thin NY style crust, but sometimes I crave their thicker crust which is delish. Total for everything was super reasonable at about $28 (not including tip). We'll definitely be throwing Barro's back into the pizza rotation!

After reading Rand's review about a month ago, I just I knew had to check this place out! I stopped by Monday after work with a list of items I'd like to try (I looked at their menu online before coming in). I ordered way too much for my husband & I, but it was my 1st time so I had to try a lil bit of everything. I got the following: shrimp ceviche tostada, carne asada burrito, carne asada tacos w/a side of rice & beans, cheese quesadilla (flour tortilla), carne asada quesadilla (corn tortilla, handmade!) "estilo del rey" style (meaning it's topped with cheese, sour cream & cilantro) & lastly a slice of chocoflan for dessert.   I had the tostada, burrito & carne asada quesadilla (over the course of 3 meals, btw) & all were excellent! Although, instead of shrimp I received chicken. It was still delicious but I was excited to try the shrimp, next time. The burrito had a lil kick to it & the meat was seasoned perfectly. The quesadilla was beyond amazing, I don't think I can ever eat a quesadilla again w/out getting it "estilo del rey" style, freakin yum! My hubby had the tacos, cheese quesadilla & half of my burrito. He thoroughly enjoyed everything & made 2 meals out of it. The chocoflan was chocolate cake topped w/a thick layer of flan. I didn't really care for the flan topping but the cake was tasty, super moist!   Total for all that food was about $33, which I find totally reasonable. I can say that this is one of the top places for Mexican in Phoenix. I can't wait to return & try all the other yummy things they have to offer!

I have been to Pappadeaux a couple times, but yesterday for lunch was the most recent.  My dad & bro like to eat lunch early to beat the "lunch crowd" so when we got there around 11:15 it was pretty dead, probably only about 10 other parties there. Sounds like a lot but this place is huge inside.  I don't remember her name but our server was a sweet girl & always made sure our glasses were full. And when I couldn't finish my meal she offered to box it up & even threw in an entire loaf of bread, nice!  My dad & bro are one in the same & ordered the blackened catfish with broccoli instead of rice & I ordered the mardi gras pasta. I sampled the catfish & it was delicious, literally melts in your mouth. My pasta dish was very good but also very rich/filling. I ate about a third of it & took the rest home for hubby. He loved it! If it wasn't lunch time & I wasn't so full already, I would have ordered dessert. Their bread pudding & creme brulee are amazing!!  If you have never been to Pappadeaux you must try it, you won't regret it.

My girl Vanessa & I were in the mood for sushi Saturday night & we decided that Roka Akor was going to be our destination!   I loved the modern look of everything about this place, from the dim lighting to the stylish furnishings. I can't believe we never checked out the bathrooms though, 2 girls sipping drinks & no restroom trip? Boo us!   We opted to sit at the bar & took 2 seats facing the restaurant. I started off with a Kirin light ($5 for a 12 oz bottle) & V got a glass of white wine. Off of the Izakaya (aka happy hour) menu we ordered: the Kobe beef & Kimchi dumplings (3 pieces for $5), their signature Hamachi Serrano Chili roll (6 pieces for $5), their signature Butterfish Tataki (3 pieces for $5) & the Cremini mushroom with soy garlic butter skewer (3 pieces for $2). Loved them all except the roll, I guess we are wimps because we thought it was too hot. I hate doing so but V sent it back, they were cool about it & didn't charge us for it. Disappointed with our sushi (the main reason for going out!), we decided to try a couple other rolls off of the regular menu. We ordered the Spicy tuna & their signature Soft Shell crab rolls. The tuna was delicious but we've both had better else where. I thought the soft shell was ok but V hated it, the warm crab just rubbed her the wrong way I guess. She wanted to return that roll as well but I stopped her, I felt bad! Still feeling hungry, (we must sound like major fatties w/all the food we ordered but I swear, small portions!) we couldn't resist & ordered the Prime beef filet w/chili ginger sauce (medium rare). OH EM GEE!!! This was definitely the favorite of the night, it was so tender it melted in our mouths! The sauce was tasty as well. Oh & we also shared their signature Blood orange margarita, one of the best cocktails I've had in a while!   With all that food & drink our total came to about $100 (including tip), not bad at all for the location & quality of food. So our dinner didn't go exactly as planned but we had a great time & would definitely come back again, just not for the sushi!

I have been here at least 10 times since my Hubby & I bought our 1st house in the summer of 08. We could walk here, we live 3 blocks away. Although, we have yet to do that. We've only ate inside 2 or 3 times, we usually just carry out because they close pretty early at 8pm, 6pm on Sundays. But its a cute little spot & like others have already stated its really clean.  We usually get the same thing every time, he gets the chicken pita with a greek salad & I get the gyros pita (with an extra side of tzatziki sauce) with fries. He'll switch it up sometimes & get the gyros pita & I have tried the hot dog & pizza puff. I also love their hummus, its so good! I have also tried the spanakopita, it was good but the flavor was too rich for me. We got a to go order tonight for dinner & for the 1st time I tried their baklava. It was pretty yummy but a tad too sweet for me. I have tried their cheesecake once before & it was awful, still frozen in the center! They also have pibb xtra in their soda fountain, our fav!  Love this place!!

One of my best friends, Renee, has been in town for a few days & I still hadn't seen her so I knew I had to meet up w/her for dinner last night, or else I'd be the world's shittiest friend. Any way, I hate Scottsdale (no offense) so I had a lil trouble getting there & parked kinda far from the restaurant. Fashion Square is such a nice mall though, I don't think I've been there for at least 2 years!  Renee & a couple of her friends were sitting on the patio outside. Since I live 25 minutes away I was way late & they were already done eating. Thankfully, they were in no hurry & sat w/me while I ordered some grub & they ordered more drinks. I decided to order 2 apps instead of an entree, I got the catfish beignets & leo's street tacos, both signature dishes. They were both so yummy, I really can't decide which one I liked better! I really wanted a marg but since I had such a long drive decided not to. I did try Amy's chambord marg though & it was delish! I hear there's a 3 drink limit w/them & I can see why-super strong!  I would love to go to the Tatum & Shea location (much closer to home) & have an actual entree & a DD so I can have a tasty marg (or 3)!

I love Macy's! My mom & I can spend some serious dough here on just a few tops, but it's so worth it! They have sales often, but it's funny how we always like the ones that are full price. Aside from the women's section, their men's section is decent (bought my hubby some denim shorts on clearance for $20 each), shoe section is just ok, Coach bags are to die for & we love their jewelry section (particularly Betsey Johnson stuff!). My mom has a Macy's card so there are usually great savings when she uses it & they send her coupons all the time!

Last December I got married at the DoubleTree & included in their wedding package was a custom designed cake from Piece of Cake Desserts.   My fiance (at the time) & I met with one of the owners, Kevin, at their cute lil shop in Mesa. We sampled 3 different cake flavors & frostings & also tried their fondant which was way better than I had anticipated. We then looked through their picture book to get an idea of what we wanted. Being the super organized girl that I am, I also brought 4 pics of what I liked. We pulled aspects from 3 different cakes & made it into 1 super cake!  Now for the best part, the flavors: bottom tier- white cake infused with almond flavor with almond cream cheese & strawberry fillings, 2nd tier- devil's food cake with caramel buttercream filling, 3rd tier- devil's food again with peanut butter filling (almost like in a Reese's) & top tier-marble cake with cookies & cream filling. YUMMM!!!   On our upcoming 1 year anniversary Piece of Cake will recreate our top tier free of charge! I am so excited for that :)

I called about 2 weeks before our 1 year anniversary, regarding the top tier of our cake. Kevin said no problem & that we could pick it up Saturday, our anniversary was on Sunday & they're closed. We couldn't decide which flavor to chose so I told him to pick it for us. I also asked if it could just be covered in buttercream instead of fondant.  The top tier looked so cute! They chose the white cake infused with almond flavor with almond cream cheese & strawberry fillings & it was AMAZING! The random dots of fondant were a nice touch & the cake was so moist & delicious. Can't wait to get our 5th anniversary top tier!

What girl doesn't love shoes?! My mama & I have been to this DSW over a dozen times & always leave with the cutest shoes & sometimes the occasional purse or scarf. My mom has their rewards card so whenever she gets a new coupon we head on over for some retail therapy.

After a talk thread about pizza & all the recommendations for Mamma Mia's I knew I had to try it.   On their yelp page they offer 15% off if you order online so I did. I ordered: the 14" cheese pizza w/pepperoni, the cheese calzone w/black olives & sausage & 2 cannolis. The pizza was freaking AMAZING! Seriously it was so damn good, I only wish I ordered the 18". I didn't try the calzone but my hubby assured me that it was delish. The cannolis, fuhgetbout it! So creamy & crunchy at the same time, yummm.  They are close to my work so I will definitely be back for lunch during the week & possibly carry out after work for those nights I don't feel like cooking.  BEST PIZZA EVER!

Tried the wings last night, pretty good but I am not much of a wings fan. Pizza was delicious as usual & the cannolis leave us wishing we ordered more.  I think it should be made more clear that the 15% off is for 1st time customers only. Before I placed my order online I called to ask what code I use to get the 15% off & the guy on the phone informed me that it was a 1 time deal. He did however give me a code for $5 off a $30 purchase. When I entered in the code it gave me $15 off! Was that a mistake? Not sure but I got a 16" pizza w/pepperoni, 12 wings, 2 extra ranches, a 2 liter of Sierra Mist & 2 cannolis, plus tax, delivery fee & tip for under $20. Amazing deal!

I'll make this quick since it's my 2nd update. We tried the meatballs a couple nights ago & they were really good! Although, on their website it said there would be 6 ($2.95 I believe) & we only received 5. Their salads however weren't the greatest, we got a caesar ($4.95) & a greek ($6.95). The caesar was pretty good, but the greek was definitely lacking. Their pizza is the best though & that's why we continue to come here!

Thanks to all the positive reviews on Yelp, my girl Danielle & I tried this place out last night.  For a Wednesday night this place was packed! There were 2 parties ahead of us waiting for a table so we opted to sit at the bar.  We started off with sake bombers. Only $5 each! I think we got a good 4-5 shots from it, so good!! I don't have too much experience with sushi so I let D order everything. From the happy hour menu she ordered the crazy boy roll & the philly roll, both only $5 each. From the regular menu she ordered the dragon roll & the yellowtail. These were all a 1st for me. The crazy boy was so yummy, I like it better than crunchy rolls which I used to always get. The philly roll was delicious, all the flavors went together perfectly! I didn't really care for the dragon roll, the eel on top was not appealing to me at all & I spilled some sake on it lol. The yellowtail was by far my favorite, even though it looked really scary when they 1st brought it out! I can't believe how good it was, so simple yet so amazing! I am definitely getting more than 1 order of it next visit.   Our total came out to $42 & some change, what a deal! We will definitely be back, during happy hour of course!!

I usually shop online when buying products from Sephora, but I have been to this location about 5 times. They have the BEST ish from nailpolish to perfume to bodywash. I also love their primers & eyeshadows. My foundation of choice is the matte bare minerals, have yet to find a concealer that I love though. If you shop here enough, they will enroll you in their VIB (very important beauty insider) program. They email you specials/discounts, send you a lil somethin on your bday & have products to chose from when you hit 100 & 500 points (on every purchase $1=1 pt).   They are affiliated with J C Penney, so I get to use my Penney's card here. Although, I can only do so online, I tried to use it the 1st time I went to the actual store & they said they don't accept them. Weird but whatev that's why I like going online better!

My Hubby loves Dippin' Dots! In high school, we used to get the vending machine packs at the movies all the time.  I ran in to get a to go order last night after dinner. In the large containers I got birthday cake & mint chocolate.   It was as yummy as we remembered! I definitely agree on the frost bite thing though, this stuff is so cold!!  We'll be back to try the other flavors such as peanut butter chip, cotton candy, & watermelon ice! They even do cakes, I'm tempted to order one for an upcoming birthday.

The hubs & I have been coming here for a couple years now. We usually hit the drive thru. Always get the same thing, butterburgers w/fries/onion rings & a concrete mixer. The employees are always super friendly & always offer our doggy a treat. Definitely our go to spot when we're in the mood for burgers & frozen custard.

My pops & I have been to Maizie's for lunch about 5-7 times in the past couple of years. Everytime it's been packed, but we've never had to wait. On our most recent trip we were seated at the tables with a chair on one side & a couch on the the other. The couches were comfy for lounging but not eating. Luckily, they were nice enough to move us to a table with two chairs where I could eat comfortably. Parking can sometimes suck but what can you do? That's down town Phoenix for ya!  My pops gets the same sandwich everytime, their signature club. It is an awesome sandwich & he is just not one for change. I have tried the club, the tuna and the grilled cheese. I have to say the grilled cheese is my fav, so freakin good! I have had their fries as a side & they are good but pretty standard. We have been getting the cottage cheese lately though, to be on the healthy side.  Like I said I have only been here for lunch & had sandwiches so I would like to try a burger & maybe even brunch. Oh & their desserts sound pretty tasty too!

Have been here a handful of times with my Hubby for lunch. I would have never given this place a 2nd look, but its literally a 2 minute drive from my work so I thought why not? Glad I did because Pizza A Metro is the bomb!!  We have tried a variety of dishes but our 2 favs have to be the Penne alla Vodka & the Capricciosa pizza, so freakin delish!! Oh & their salads are pretty yummy too. The bread they give you is tasty as well.  We hadn't been here in a few months but on our most recent trip this past Wednesday, it seemed to be under new ownership. Sad-I really loved the spunky, lil Italian dude with pretty blue eyes!  If you have never been, give it a try, you won't regret it! :)

The hubs & I love El Pollo Loco! It's a quick drive from our house, so I'd say about once a month we get a craving for it. Their chicken is the bomb & smells delicious as you pull up to the drive thru window. Our fav side has to be the mac & cheese, weird I know considering this is a mexican food joint, but man that stuff is good. We also enjoy their flour tortillas. They usually have a meal deal that includes a free cake but we aren't cake people so I always bring it to work. But we do love their flan & the churros are pretty good too. There can be a lil bit of a wait sometimes at the drive thru but trust me, it's worth the wait!

After a very filling dinner my hubby & I decided to stop by Sweet Republic for some dessert to go, since they were closing soon. This was our 1st time here, so we sampled a few different flavors before making our selections. My hubby went with strawberry buttermilk in a waffle cone with sprinkles on top. I was not quite ready for dessert yet, so everything else I ordered was to go: a pint of salted butter caramel, madagascar vanilla & peanut butter chip ice cream sandwiches, a bag of housemade marshmallows & a bag of sea salt caramels (see photo). I know, I know, that's A LOT of sweets! But hey, we live in North Phoenix, so I knew we wouldn't be stopping by again anytime soon. Honestly, every single thing was AMAZING! I must go back & try more because I'm pretty sure anything you get here is delish. Total for all that was about $30 & it was the best $30 I've ever spent. Oh & I almost forgot to add, they packed 2 bags of ice with our goodies to insure they wouldn't melt on our 25 minute drive home, awesome customer service!

I love this Target! I have been shopping here for about 3 years, ever since I moved into the neighborhood. The staff is friendly/helpful when it comes to returns/exchanges, finding an item/aisle & check out. Sometimes the lines can move slow & parking can be difficult, but hey that can happen anywhere! I have only gone grocery shopping here once but I love stopping in for random items. I usually come out with way more than I intended to buy coming in, but it's hard to pass up cute stuff I don't need for cheap ;)

The delivery guy & the girl who answers the phone are so freakin rude! When we placed a delivery order about 2 months ago they forgot my husband's salad. The delivery guy said he'd be back to drop it off. My husband called them with a bit of an attitude & the girl hung up on him. The delivery guy never came back to bring the salad we paid for. We ordered from them about once a month but never will again.

My hubby is a big sub fan & Jersey Mike's is one of his favorites. We were in the area on Sunday & decided to have lunch here. We were warmly greeted by the employees & looked over the menu. Hubs chose #7 (turkey & provolone) giant size & I chose #6 (roast beef & provolone) mini size. We both chose white bread, he got all the fixins & I went the boring route with just lettuce & mustard. We both made our meals combos by adding chips & sodas. What I found awesome was that they support Susan G. Komen for the cure (breast cancer organization) & were selling pink cups for 70 cents more, with all proceeds going to their cause! Any how, the meats & cheeses are sliced fresh right in front of you & it makes their subs that much better. The bread is very delicious as well. Total for everything was less than $25, a lil on the pricey side but they blow Subway & other similar places out of the water! Plus, my hubby's sub was so huge that he made it into his dinner as well.

I came here for the 1st time this past Saturday & I only wish I had started coming here sooner! I usually go to the Harkins on Bell & 34th st, but I like this location MUCH more, this will now be my go to movie theater. It's much cleaner than most movie theaters I've been to & it's HUGE! The screen & sound also seem to be of much higher quality. The employees here are also friendly & helpful. Even though I don't have kids, I think it's pretty neat they have a place where you can drop your kids off at to play if you want to see a movie & couldn't find a sitter. Not sure if it's complimentary or not but either way it's a cool idea!   P.S. The movie my mom & I saw was Just Go With It, horrible movie! Adam Sandler needs to stop making comedies already...

I wanted to stop by here for some lunch today, but had a little trouble finding the place since I am so directionally (that's def. not a word) challenged. I called them & the guy who answered the phone guided me right to the shop. The owners (father & son?) were sitting outside at a lil table & got up to open the door for me, so polite!  There were only about 2 tiny tables inside but I bet most costumers carry out. They make their bread fresh daily & desserts just as often, so as you can imagine it smelled wonderful in there. I definitely got too much but hey it was my 1st time going there! I ordered the following: spinach & cheese burek, meat & potato burek, a similar looking bread but with yummy mozzarella on top instead of inside, a (huge) piece of chocolate cream coffee cake & another (huge) piece of a vanilla custard dessert with a flaky, pastry top finished with powdered sugar.  I tried every single item & am happy to say they were all good! The bureks were pretty good but maybe too filling for me, the bread with mozzarella on top was probably my fav. Both desserts were amazing & I loved them both equally.  For all that my total was a little over $18. I will definitely be back & next time I have to get a loaf of their freshly made bread!

I have been wanting to try Noca for quite a while now, so when they had a Groupon a few weeks ago I bought one & decided this would be our Valentine's day date destination. I made reservations for Saturday the 12th at 8:30pm. We were about 15 minuets late, but the hostess was very gracious & seated us immediately. We were sat at a high top table with a chair on 1 side & a booth on the other. There wasn't much going on with the design of the restaurant, but I did like the mirrors across from us & the lighting fixtures. I also liked the faucets in the bathrooms.   For starters we ordered the mussels, our server said it was more of a one person dish so we each got our own. They were delicious & he was right, we both finished ours. I ordered the nocarita to sip on & my husband surprisingly opted for a sprite. My cocktail was strong but tasty. Our 1st Amuse Bouche of the night, a bite of what tasted like cucumbers & radish. It was light & refreshing. The server who brought it out did describe it, but it was so loud in there we honestly didn't hear him. Our 2nd was a cute lil teacup of parsnip soup. It was creamy & smooth, I loved it! My hubby wouldn't even try it though, so I gladly had both of ours. I almost forgot to mention the bread & olive oil that came before our app, very basic but very good.  About an hour had passed from when we had received our app. I didn't notice the length of time, but my husband made a comment to me about how long we'd been waiting for our entrees. A few minutes later our server came up to us apologizing for the wait. He informed us that dinner was on the house tonight & gave us back our Groupon to use another time. I told him I could see that they were very busy & they didn't have to comp our dinner for us, but he insisted. He then brought out a fresh crab cake of sorts with strawberries & a cilantro drizzle, to nibble on while we waited for our entrees.   About 15 minutes later our entrees arrived. My hubby ordered the prime hangar steak & I ordered the striped bass. Both were superb but I think I had the winner. We were already pretty full from all the previously mentioned food we ate, so we took a majority of our entrees to go. I was going to skip dessert since I was already stuffed & I knew we'd be getting some cotton candy, but our server convinced me & I got the doughnuts to go. They were pretty good & I loved the dipping sauces. The cotton candy was a blue-raspberry flavor & my husband loved it, such a fun, sweet end to our meal. Oh & they also handed out tiny shortbread cookies, which were buttery & slightly crunchy, yum!   If our meal hadn't been taken care of, the total would have been about $111. Service throughout our meal was outstanding, I don't think our water glasses were ever less than half full. We left our server a tip that was probably more than most would have left, but he was great & it wasn't his fault our meal tickets were misplaced. I can't wait to return with my Groupon for another amazing meal, well done Noca!

I'm not a big fan of Walmart, I prefer Target hands down. It seems like no matter what location I go to they always smell so weird. I have been to this location a few times since moving into the area. Prices are low but so is the quality, you get what you pay for! My last visit here was with my prego friend Mary who needed to pick up a breast pump she ordered online. I was making her a yummy dinner that night so she also got a couple bottles of wine. Check out was a pain in the ass since our cashier was so slow & the old lady in front of us had a million coupons. Regardless of all the negatives, I'm sure I'll be back!

I love Hug N Pups! I had taken my lil 3 lb Maltese here for about 2 years but then we moved so I had to find a new place to get her groomed. I went to about 4 other places & none of them even compared. Thankfully we moved again & were closer to Hug N Pups! These are different owners from the last time I brought Angel in but they are just as great!   BTW, they have moved as well, not too far though just across the street. The new address is: 1609 E Bell Rd Suite B9 Phoenix, AZ 85022. Their phone # is still the same.  Even if we do have to move again I will still bring my babygirl here because they are amazing at what they do, LOVE HUG N PUPS!!

My mom & I had dinner here Sunday night before heading to a show. The show started at 6:30 so we got there right at 5 when they opened. This place is super tiny but I liked the decor & where we were seated there was a huge heart mural thingy, I dug it. I didn't care for the bathroom (yes not plural, because there is only one!) though, I tried to check my makeup & you can't see a thing in there!   Even though I am not a martini person I decided to order one since they had such an extensive list. I decided on the violet one. From the description it sounded good but omg it was horrible. I tried to down it but finally but mom told our server I didn't like it but we'd gladly pay for it. He said that it was one if their more unique concoctions & then he brought out a karma something martini (how nice) & I liked it much better!   For our dinner we ordered the following: lemongrass soy chicken, sugar cane pork w/pineapple ginger sauce, pineapple ginger tofu, papaya mango spring rolls, bacon wrapped mushrooms & a side of jasmine rice. The stand outs for me were the chicken & pork, especially the pork it was amazing! I am not a tofu person but I have to admit theirs was good. My mom loved the spring rolls, tofu & pork as well.

Came here for the 1st time last night with my Hubby to use our $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com. I love that site, such awesome deals!   This place is tiny, but kinda cozy & we liked that. There is a dude that plays guitar/sings every Monday night so we caught that. He was pretty good.   Our server might have told us her name but I don't remember, it was too loud with the music in there any way. She was sweet though & made sure our glasses were never empty. We drink a lot when we eat so we both appreciated that.   For an appetizer we decided on the maple bacon wrapped shrimp that came with roasted red pepper sauce. We love shrimp apps & this one definitely did not disappoint. The sauce was amazing as well. My Hubby loves salads so he ordered the house salad, I had a bite & it was very fresh. For our entrees: my Hubby was set on the stuffed chicken but was bummed when our server said they ran out-boo! She suggested the rigatoni & meatballs so he got that instead. I opted for the chicken pesto. Unfortunately, Hubby did not really care for his meal, said it was mediocre at best. Mine however, was so yummy! I must always get dessert when we go out for dinner, so I decided on the creme brulee. Theirs is very different from others I've had in the past, but in a good way! It's topped with sliced bananas & at the bottom some sort of chocolate ganache. OH EM GEE, it was amazing!! Oh & I almost forgot, I saw on their menu that they had bacon mac & cheese so I ordered it to go for my lunch today. It was definitely the adult version of mac & cheese & you can never go wrong with bacon :)   We will definitely come back to Floyd's, especially to try: the artichoke spinach dip, hummus, mahi mahi tacos, stuffed chicken & of course their desserts!

Last Monday I used a Groupon I bought about a month ago to place a to go order. Whenever I have a coupon of any kind I order more than usual, so I got the following for my husband & I: maple bacon wrapped shrimp, artichoke spinach dip, stuffed chicken, chicken marsala & creme brulee. The shrimp app was as delicious as the last time, the AS dip was pretty good but I wish it came with all bread instead of mostly stale tortilla chips, hubby loved the stuffed chicken, I loved the chicken marsala & the creme brulee was a disappointment, but I believe it was because I took it to go. Next time we go here we are definitely dining inside so I can get some of their yummy creme brulee the way it's supposed to be!

It was my parent's 27th anniversary so my mom asked if my hubby & I would like to join them for dinner, of course we would! Typically my parents would go to Outback or Olive Garden but I asked if we could please switch it up & my mom told me to pick a place. I had received a postcard from Ocean Prime for $25 off & thought why not? It must have been meant to be because my mom got one too & said she was thinking about trying it out also. I called & made reservations for Saturday the 26th at 7pm.   The place was packed when we arrived, literally every table was filled. The design was very sleek & modern, with neon blue lighting. We were seated at a table near the bar & Rebecca was our server, she was awesome!   Fresh bread & butter were immediately brought out, yummy. We started off with the colossal shrimp cocktail & half order of oysters. My hubby & I shared the shrimp cocktail, 3 HUGE pieces of shrimp with dry ice underneath, very cool & very tasty. My parents shared the oysters & loved them. My dad is a scotch man so he ordered a couple johnnie walker's with club soda. I am a vodka girl so I decided to try the berries & bubbles cocktail. OMG was this cocktail delicious, the pieces of fruit & dry ice sent it over the top, I loved it so much I had 2. My hubby went with the tequila cocktail & thought it was just ok, I knew he should have stuck with his usual captain & coke.   On to the entrees. My dad ordered the 7oz filet mignon (med-rare), my mom ordered the salt n pepper tuna (WELL DONE! WTF, WHO DOES THAT? I TOLD HER NOT TO BUT SHE INSISTED, UGH.), my hubby ordered the sea scallops & I ordered the twin lobster tails. For sides we all shared the sauteed wild mushrooms & jumbo asparagus with hollandaise. We all sampled each others entrees & everything was amazing, except my mom's tuna since she ruined it by ordering it well freakin done, but my lobster tails were the crowd favorite. Both side dishes were delicious as well. We were all so full but decided to get dessert since we were celebrating. We chose the chocolate peanut butter pie. Damn was it good, somehow we all managed to make room & had to keep ourselves from licking the plate clean.   I brought that $25 off postcard I mentioned earlier & so did my mom. I thought they wouldn't except both at one table, but since we were paying with 2 cards they let us use 1 on each card, awesome! So with the promotional $50 off our total came to about $230 (not including tip). A tad overpriced, (which is why I only gave 4 stars) so I don't see us coming often, but we all thoroughly enjoyed our dinner so for a special occasion it's worth the splurge!

Last Saturday night the hubby & I had a date night & I picked Fogo de Chao for dinner. I made reservations for 8, but we were running very late so I called & asked if we could push it back to 9 & they were very accommodating.   When we finally arrived we were immediately seated in the full dining room. Our server gave us the break down of how they operate here & told us we could get started at the salad bar. We each got a plateful of yummy veggies, cured meats & cheeses. Our favs from the salad bar were: parmesan & manchego cheeses, prosciutto, artichokes, salami, asparagus & mushrooms. After that we flipped our cards to the green side & a slew of meats were presented. We tried 2 or 3 at a time, then flipped to the red side to sample & then flipped back to green when we were ready for more (you'll understand what red & green means when you go!). We tried 10 different meats & our top 4 favs were: picanha-top sirloin (their signature steak), cordeiro-lamb legs & chops & beef ancho-rib eye. Included with the endless meat options are 3 side dishes: polenta, garlic mashed potatoes & caramelized bananas, you also receive a basket of pão de queijo-cheese bread. The sides were just ok, the potatoes were the best, but that cheese bread was so yummy!   Total for everything including drinks (no cocktails) but not including tip was $107. Not cheap, but considering the amount of food you could possibly get, it's worth it! Not a place I would go to regularly, but it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you are a meat lover!

I have seen this place quite often when I would get sugaring & facials done by my girl Jenny, who had a space in the same complex. I saw her after I got off work though & they were always closed by then. Well today I decided to make the trip over there for a to go lunch order.  When I walked in there was only 1 group of people at a table, a large group though of about 7. There was an older couple at the front who I later found out are the new owners, very sweet people. I ordered a small white ninja bowl for myself & a large for my husband. My hubs also wanted a cheese quesadilla but unfortunately they did not have them, I was also wanting a croissant but unfortunately they were all out. Double bummer! I saw the few donuts they had left & got a half dozen.   The bowls were yummy, we both loved the sauce & the chicken was delicious. The donuts were freaking amazing! I got 6 different kinds & we split the glazed & cinnamon crumb, can't wait to try the others! For the small & large bowls & a half dozen donuts the total came to $17 & some change, a lil pricey but reasonable. We will definitely return!

I have been dying to try Pita Jungle since I have had a handful of friends tell me how good/healthy this place was. Last night, I finally made a stop there for dinner. I had just finished my zumba class & was extremely tired/sweaty so I opted to take our meals to go.  I looked over the menu a bit before giving my order to the sweet girl working the bar. I decided on: a large order of hummus with 2 extra pitas, spinach pasta salad, pita pizza & a small order of the garlic new potatoes. Their hummus is AMAZING!! Their pita bread is yummy & pretty big pieces. The spinach pasta salad was a lot more pasta than spinach but I liked it. The portion was HUGE, could easily feed me for 3 more lunches/dinners. The pita pizza was ok, very tiny! The garlic new potatoes were delish, I loved the seasonings.   Overall, I really liked it here & would love to come back & actually sit down & eat there.The entire dining/bar area & outside patio was PACKED & it was only Monday night. Can't imgaine how busy it gets on a weekend!

Just an FYI, not sure how long ago but I think pretty recently, this place has new owners. It is now called Halo Halo Kitchen aka H2K.   My mom was born & raised in the Philippines, so she was pretty excited to come here for lunch this past Thursday afternoon.   She quickly got to talking to the guy behind the counter & another customer to see what was good here. She decided on about 7 different items for her, my dad & myself to try. My personal favs were the fried tilapia, chicken adobo (although, my mom's is better!), lumpia, pancit & this fried egg & pork combo that I can't remember the name of. Oh & they also had this dessert which was little round balls on a stick made from what smelled/tasted like doughnut batter. There was a sweet syrup on top with what tasted like coconut on the inside. They were lick your fingers delicious!!   We'll definitely be back :)

My mom & I were looking for a healthy place to have lunch yesterday, so I did a search for healthy spots near my work & Luci's was the 1st place to come up. Finding a parking spot was kind of hard, we drove around twice & then finally someone was backing out so we scored a spot. We made our way over to the cafe side & looked over the menu. I got the strawberry patch salad (added chicken) & my mom got the veggie head salad. For drinks I got the pomegranate citrus iced tea & my mom, who always asks if places carry diet sprite/7up (they NEVER do), settled for a stevia sweetened lemon-lime soda. I LOVED my salad, although I wish the chicken was grilled, my mom said hers was pretty good. I really liked my iced tea, so refreshing! My mom said  she didn't like her soda, but she drank it all so it probably wasn't that bad. Total for our salads & drinks was about $25. Seems a lil pricey to me, which initially was the reason I wanted to give Luci's 3 stars, but that open garage is just way too cool, so 4 stars it is. If I wasn't trying to be healthy that day I so would have sampled some of the yummy looking desserts, they all looked amazing!

My mama & I came here this afternoon for lunch. Walking up to the door  I could smell wonderful food being made. It was pretty crowded on the main side of the restaurant so we were seated on the pretty much empty side. But that was fine with us, we wanted to chat any way.   Mom ordered her usual sprite & I ordered an arnold palmer. Sprite came in a can, eh. Arnold palmer was very tangy, good-but I've had better. For our entrees: mom ordered the ensalada cortada & I ordered the carne asada burrito with a side of white rice. Mom didn't really care too much for her salad, I thought it was pretty good though & helped her eat it. In exchange she had about a third of my burrito, which she loved. The carne asada was so tender & flavorful, it was so yummy I finished almost the entire thing which is rare for me. The rice was good but a bit over cooked & on the dry side.  I would love to come back & try: the guacamole everyone raves about, fish tacos & amazing sounding chocolate pudding! :)

We hadn't been out for breakfast in quite some time, so yesterday I convinced my hubby we needed to go & he agreed. I had bookmarked a couple places on here & we decided to give Tiny's a try.   Our waitress was a sweet lady & promptly took our drink orders. No coffee for us, hubs got o.j. & I got apple juice. After looking over the menu, I decided on the french toast, side of bacon, & the specialty hash browns. Hubby got the chef's omelette that came with hash browns & toast. The french toast was simple & a small portion but that was perfect for me, I loved it! The bacon was tasty & the hash browns were amazing-in addition to potatoes it also had onions, cheese, & a dollop of sour cream on top, delish! Hubby's omelette was huge so he could only finish half but he said it was yummy & he finished the hash browns & toast so that's always a good sign.   Our total came to $25 & come change, not including tip. Not bad, not bad at all!  We will definitely come back for a Sunday breakfast. Especially in September, which is when the hostess informed us of their famous cinnamon buns being made then!

We had seen this place when we ate at 5th Avenue cafe (not that great, btw) a couple weeks ago & decided to try it out.  The woman at the register was very helpful in our decision making. I believe she was the owner, very sweet! The art/decor is cool, not what I expected. I liked the high tables & chairs as well.  I got the tuna wrap & my hubby got a chicken & veggie wrap. I opted for the side of chips & he got the cup of fruit. My wrap was very yummy, only complaint is that the juices would run out when I got near the end but nothing a little napkin wipe can't fix. My hubby said his wrap was very fresh & healthy. I did have a bite of his fruit & I could tell it was fresh, very tasty.  SInce we both got cold wraps I am curious to try a hot wrap. Needless to say we will more than likely come back for lunch.

I am not a coffee drinker, but after reading Jennifer T.'s awesome review for a different location I had to try a blended coffee drink, which is the only way I'll drink the stuff. I have passed this place a million times when driving somewhere for lunch during the work week, so today I decided to give it a try. When I pulled up to the drive thru window a very friendly girl greeted me. After getting a chance to look over the menu while waiting in line, I decided on the caramelizer, which happened to be the special of the month. I also got a lemon poppy seed muffin top. The drink was very yummy! However, I would have liked a bit more caramel flavor. I haven't tried the muffin top yet, saving it for my dessert tonight. The girl who was working also gave me some coupons & a punch card that will give you a free drink after 10 purchases. Total for both items was $6.25. I'll definitely come back whenever I'm in the mood for "coffee"!

Feeling sorry for myself, I needed a pick me up & decided to get some donuts. I pulled into Bosa & it was empty, probably because it was noon & normal people usually get donuts in the morning. I loved the lady working behind the counter, she was so sweet! Any way, I got half a dozen donuts, a croissant & small bottle of milk. Total for everything was less than $8. I went home for lunch & my hubby was there so he sampled the donuts with me. His favs were the glazed & sugar coated. My favs were the chocolate long john & cinnamon roll. Our not so favs were the apple fritter & cake donut with a ridiculous amount of icing. The croissant was light & flaky, yummy.

What a fun lil shop! I came here this afternoon looking for some stocking stuffers. I didn't wanna miss anything, so I walked around & literally looked at every single item, I must have been there at least 30-45 minutes. For my hubby I found these cute Cold Boulders, which are reusable ice cubes made out of stone. I thought these would keep his drinks cooler longer, plus they won't water down his Captain! I also picked up some candy canes, pop rocks & fun dip for him. Oh & I can't forget the lil magnet I got that says stud with a pic of a muffin, a nickname for our English Bulldog. For my dad I got an abba-zaba & big hunk. He loves peanuts/peanut butter & those are both old school candies, right?! I love caramels, so I bought a couple of the sea salt caramels & 1 bigger piece of the vanilla caramel. Total for all my items was a lil over $28.

Last night was my 1st time coming to this location. I have been to the PV mall & Scottsdale & Mayo locations a few times in the past. Oh & does anyone remember the OLD location INSIDE of PV mall, where it had 2 stories?! That location was the shit. Any way I love Chick-fil-a! Their nuggets beat any fast food joints out there-McDonalds, Wendys, all of em. I also love their waffle fries, so addicting! I haven't had one in a while, but their milkshakes are bomb too! The employees are also very friendly which is always appreciated.

*This review is based on drinks only*   My sis Jacinthe & I participated in the Cupcake Crawl last night & it was a lot of fun! Hula's was the 2nd stop from 7-8pm. Their happy hour ends at 6pm Mon-Fri, but they let us crawlers have the happy hour prices, nice. There wasn't much room for us so we had to stand at 1st, ugh, but then 2 ladies left early to the next stop & we snagged their seats. We ordered the blood orange & pink bikini martinis (only $5 each, regularly $7). Both were so yummy! We also got to sample lil cupcakes from Nothing Bundt Cakes, white chocolate raspberry FTW! Since it was nearing the time to head to the next stop we only ordered those 2 cocktails, but I wish we had time for another round because they were so delicious & cheap! The only complaint we had was that it was super hot in there & we had to use menus to fan ourselves. I do have to say I love that open patio though, it would be so nice to sit out there & have cocktails in the fall & spring time. I would definitely return for happy hour & maybe sample some food!

Last Monday, my husband was re-keying a property (he works for Century 21) & saw that there was a dog in the backyard. This property had been vacant for a year now so he knew the dog did not belong to any current tenants. He tried to approach the dog but she ran off out to the front & he couldn't catch her. On Wednesday he had to return to the property & he saw the dog again, but her condition was much worse than on Monday so he tried to approach her again. This time, instead of running away, she turned over on her back as to say "Help me!". He called me & let me know the situation & I agreed that we could take her in.   We have 2 dogs of our own, so at 1st they did not like this new doggie on their territory. But after a couple hours they were welcoming & they all seemed to get along ok. The next day (Thursday) we went grocery shopping & got home around 7pm. The stray we took in was hiding in our closet & seemed frightened. My hubby picked her up to see if something was wrong & as he was looking her over in front of a mirror he saw a puppy was coming out!!! We had NO idea she was pregnant, my hubs thought her stomach was expanded due to not having any food, but boy was he wrong! Panic set in & we did not know what to do so we decided to drive up the street to the animal hospital. We loaded mama & her pup into the back of our Lexus. I was in the back with them & during our 30 second drive another puppy was born, holy shit this was nuts!  Dr. Lunt was working that night & he graciously took them in & cared for them. She had 2 more puppies at the hospital, 3 males & 1 female. Friday they called & informed me that if we didn't take them in they would have to turn them over to the humane society. I could not let that happen so I convinced my hubby to take them in. After a million phone calls I got in contact with Lost Our Home & they found a foster home for them by Sunday, it was amazing! Mama & her puppies are all healthy & doing great. My mother in law is even adopting the mama (after the puppies are weaned of course) so that my brother in law will finally have a new doggie, since theirs passed away last year. He named her Lucky, which I think is perfect. :)  I can't thank Dr. Lunt, Jessica & the rest of the staff at North Valley Regional Animal Hospital enough!

I have frequented this Paradise Bakery more than a dozen times since it opened. I always carry out though, have never actually ate there. I used to be annoyed when ordering because it seemed like every employee was so confused, but things have gotten much better.   My husband loves their club sandwich, pasta salad & always builds his own salad. I love building my own salad as well, their chicken caeser is yummy, love their tuna sandwich & LOVE their fire roasted tomato soup! Their sourdough bread & croissants are delicious as well. But my fav item here of course is the cookies! The chippers in particular are my personal favs; the sugar, lemon & black & white are out of this world!! Their regular chocolate chip cookies that come with every sandwich order are so good too, perfectly chewy & not too sugary sweet.  I also love their loyalty card, earned myself a free meal last night!

Items I have tried recently that were delish:  -Asiago roast beef sandwich, I normally don't like horseradish sauce but it's amazing on this bad boy!  -White cheddar mac & cheese, freakin yum!  -Coconut chocolate chip cookies, better than the regular chocolate chip cookies!

Jenny Webdale is amazing at what she does!! She really has a passion for organic skin care/hair removal & it shows. I have had strip waxing done in the past & sugaring is so much better in my opinion. Jenny has been doing my facials/peels & sugaring for over 4 years now & I recommend her to any & everyone!   She has since moved locations though, her new address is: 3820 W Happy Valley Rd, next to Safeway in the Bella Donne suites. Her # is still the same.   If you are interested in setting up an appointment call her ASAP! She always gives new clients a 1st time discount, too. She is the BEST, you won't regret it! :)

Attention All Ladies:  Has wearing sandals &/or heels all year done a number on your footsies? For the 1st time last week I tried out a peel on my callused feet & OH EM GEE they look a million times better now! She can also do this peel on your hands or any other rough areas. If you "like" the Sugar Spa on Facebook you will be able to keep track of the monthly specials & discounts.

During our trip to the mall today my friend/hair stylist Martinique & I stopped at Sugar Daddy Cupcakes for a sweet treat. We decided on: the raspberry lemon zest, a peanut butter cup, the caramel fudge & the vanilla lemon. We shared 2 of them & I took the other 2 home for my Hubby & I. All of the flavors were amazingly good, the cake was so moist & delicious. I loved the decoration, the sparkles are too cute! Only complaint is that there was a bit too much frosting on them, but that's just for me others might like it like that. Would love to order some for a birthday or any other special occasion!

I have to agree with the other reviews, this place used to be so much better!  My hubs & I 1st tried it over 2 years ago & loved it. We stopped by for dinner last Thursday for the 1st time in months. I can't say there's a huge difference in the way the food tastes, but I can definitely say service is lacking! Any way, we always get the same thing-carne asada burritos. They were pretty good . But I do feel like we were over-charged & they only print a receipt with the total so who knows what they add on.   If I'm ever in Anthem I will have to check out the original owners new place, they were so nice & will be missed in Phoenix!

I was a lil hesitant to come here after hearing about how rude the staff is, but I needed a pedi last minute Saturday & my usual place closed at 6pm. I called Infinity at 6:10 & they said I could come in at 6:30. I arrived at about 6:35 & they were super busy. The guy up front told me to have a seat & they'd be ready for me shortly. About 10 minutes later he brought me over to a massage chair where I let my feet soak. Another 10 minutes go by & then a lady gets started on my pedi. She was actually very sweet & even apologized for my wait, which she didn't really need to since they were clearly packed. She gave me an awesome pedi, a good massage that was about 5 minutes maybe longer & did a really cute design (see photo). I just got the basic pedi which was $20 plus $10 for the design, I'd like to get an upgraded pedi when I'm not in a hurry. When you first walk in the place seems pretty tiny, but it's actually bigger once you walk further back. There were about 8 nail stations & about 12 pedi chairs. I liked the glass bowls with color changing lights to soak your feet in, cute & different than other places I've been to. Also, when I was paying the guy up front (the owner maybe?) gave me a stamp card for every visit that I spend $20 or more on. After 8 visits, on my 9th I will get $20 off, I think that's pretty cool. This is definitely my new favorite nail place & I will for sure be a repeat customer!

I usually fill up at Valero or the pumps at Fry's but I needed to fill up NOW & this Circle K was on the way to my destination. What I found cool about this particular location is that I was able to use my Fry's card & received 10 cents off per gallon. I will definitely keep that in mind for future reference!

I bought a $25 g.c. from restaurants.com about a month ago & decided to use it Friday night. We got there around 8 & the place was pretty empty, only 3 other parties were there but that could have been because they close at 9. Our server was Demmo himself, nice guy! I have to say the decor is very dated, it looked like someones grandma brought everything in from the gaudy window treatments to the floral tablecloths!   We decided to order a couple cocktails since they had a pretty interesting list. Hubby got the pomegranate marg & I got the bubble blue lemonade. Both drinks were so good! For an app we ordered the lahame calzonedilla which was what looked like a quesadilla with lamb & mozzarella & it also came with an amazing dipping sauce called taz-ho. After our app came out we got a basket of bread, it was kinda cold but pretty good. My hubby loved it & finished off the whole thing. For our entrees hubs ordered chicken parmesan & I ordered the pick your own pasta with penne, alfredo, bacon & spinach, both meals came with a side salad & bread. We both enjoyed the pasta dishes, not the greatest we've had but definitely good. The salads were ok & the bread was yummy as well. I had to order dessert so I got the chocolate/butterscotch pie & 3 mini canolis to go. I had the pie & it was pretty good, didn't care for the crust though, hubs had the canolis & loved em! He only wished they were bigger because they were only about 2 bites each.   Our total, minus the $25 g.c., came to about $35, not bad but a tad more than I expected it to be. Overall we liked the food & cocktails, but it is pretty far from us so we won't go out of our way to return, but would definitely come in if we are in the area.

I have been wanting to try Smashburger for a few weeks now & asked my dad if he'd like to go there for lunch yesterday. We arrived shortly after noon & the place was pretty packed. My dad ordered the grilled smashchicken & I ordered the classic smashburger (no onions, tomatoes or ketchup) with smashfries. Dad enjoyed his chicken sandwich, but said they put too much mayo on it. My burger was pretty good, I must say, the smashsauce that came on it was tasty! The fries were yummy & my dad agreed. Total for both meals with drinks was under $20. We would definitely return!

Sunday evening my hubby & I were looking for a place to have dinner & The Vig came to mind so off we went. It was pretty early, about 5:45pm, so we beat the dinner crowd. We were seated in a comfy booth with a view of their open area patio. I know this is such a girl thing to say, but I love their bathroom sinks!   For starters we got the crab & artichoke dip. It was rich & creamy & just the right amount for 2 people. The spiced pita chips that came with were a yummy pairing. I also got a cocktail, captain appleseed. It smelled just like apple pie but was a bit too strong for my liking. For our entrees; my hubby got the rubin's cuban sandwich with a mixed green salad & I got the horseradish crusted tilapia that came with a crab stuffed portobello, asparagus, potatoes & a roasted red pepper sauce. Hubs loved his sandwich & salad, everything tasted extremely fresh. I also loved my fish & every single side, I cleaned my plate which means I was hungry & it was delicious! Even though I was stuffed, I had to get dessert. I got the bread pudding with vanilla ice cream to go. We dug in later that night & it was pretty good, big enough for 2-3 people.  Total (not including tip) for a cocktail, an app, 2 entrees & dessert was about $57. A lil pricey but the food was great so I'd say it's worth it!

This past Saturday night I convinced my husband to go out & have dinner at a buffet. I have been wanting to go to Wandering Horse for a while now, so we made the trek out to Scottsdale. The last time we were here it was in the tents, so it was all new to us. The remodel is beautiful! Wish we could have checked out the rooms.  We also met his cousin & our friend there. We were seated right away & went right to the buffet. As soon as we got back to the table our sweet server took our drink orders. She checked on us a few times & made sure empty glasses were refilled.  There was so much freakin food! This has definitely got to be the best buffet in AZ. Some of my fav items were: fried shrimp, salmon, kobe beef, broccolini, shrimp scampi, bread with pesto spread & cheese, roasted corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, mussels, fried rice, pizza, pork eggrolls-I'm sure there's more but you get the idea. Dessert was pretty good as well. Some fav items there were: mint chocolate chip gelato, fruit tarts, creme brulee, some strawberry/white cake creation & the boys fav-a crepe with warm nutella!  At 1st, I was going to dock a star for the $27 per person price tag, but it was just so good I had to give it 5 stars. I'd love to come back on a Sunday for brunch & take full advantage of the endless mimosas!

When my hubby & I were in high school he got a job here & made me sign up for a credit card. 8 years later & I love having my Penneys card! Aside from all the awesome sales & coupons from JCP, I can use my card at CVS & Sephora.com too. Yesterday I bought 3 tops (all on sale) & used a $15 coupon, bringing my total to $50 & some change. Mind you, all 3 tops were originally $40+. I love saving money just as much as I love spending it!

We had to take our bulldog to the vet last night & Rocket Burger & Subs was sort of on the way home, so I thought this was a good time for us to try this place out. I called ahead to place a to go order since we had our pup with us.   Since this was our 1st visit, I went a little overboard & ordered the following for my hubby & I: large Country Club sub (no mayo-add mustard), large Greek salad, 8 piece mini corn dogs, onion rings, pizza bread with pepperoni & of course we had to get some of their tasty bottled beverages (2 root beers-1 with vanilla added, the blue Jones soda & Dublin Dr. Pepper)! The food was seriously amazing & such great prices, with all that food & 4 bottled sodas our total was less than $25.  The guys that worked there, & who I believe are the owners, were so friendly & helpful. We can't wait to come back again & again to try all the other yummy goodies!!

This past Tuesday night I did not feel like making dinner at all so I suggested Rocket Burger & Subs & my hubby gladly agreed. I placed a to go order & they said it would be ready in 10 mins.  My hubby loved the country club sub so much he ordered it again, but this time he added pepperoncinis. I switched it up & ordered a cheeseburger w/lettuce & pickle & decided to give their thousand island spread a try. We love their onion rings but I wanted to try their fries this time & also got a small order of cheese curds. As if I didn't order enough, I got the pb&j too. Sub was awesome, burger was very good but next time I will just get mustard, fries were yummy but onion rings are better, cheese curds were bomb & the pb&j was ok, the homemade jam was too chunky for our liking. Oh & of course we got some bottled drinks, 2 root beers & 2 orange sodas-we shared & they were all so good!  I want to try a hot dog next. After that, I think I will have sampled almost the entire menu, haha what a fatty!

Yes, I know, this is my 2nd update so I'll try to make it short & sweet.   I bought a Groupon about a week ago & decided to use it this past Saturday when the hubs & I were trying to think of a place to have lunch. I got the chili cheese dog this time & it was delicious! Cheese burger & onion rings were freakin yum as usual & I have to say the fries were better this time around. We went a lil crazy & got 4 additional sodas, along with the 2 we had during lunch, 2 root beers, 2 cream sodas & 2 orange sodas. I also have to add, since this was our 1st time dining in, how clean it was! They had a girl at the register this time & she was super sweet.  We love this place!!

I heard about Torched Goodness through Yelp (of course), & liked them on Facebook so I could see where they would be located, since they move around all the time. They ran a special around Thanksgiving & Christmas, 12 for $35. I ordered 2 of each of the following: vanilla, chocolate, peanut butter, lemon, lavender & sea salt caramel. My husband picked them up on Christmas eve. They were nicely packaged & also included sugar & a lil bit of sea salt for the caramel brulee. They were all so yummy, but chocolate was our favorite, with sea salt caramel being a close 2nd. I spoke to Julia during the ordering/pick up process & she was such a sweetheart, I would definitely order from them again!

Not knowing what I wanted today for lunch, I scrolled through my bookmarks & decided to go with Pork on a Fork. The place was empty when I walked in but I was warmly greeted by the dude at the register. I told him it was my 1st time so I'd need a couple minutes, he said to take my time.   I finally decided on the pulled pork sandwich & got my hubby the brat. Both came with 2 sides, I got the baked beans & potato salad for us both. I got this order to go so I forgot to put some of their BBQ sauce on my sandwich, bummer. Any way, the pulled pork was amazing! Great flavor & a huge portion. Hubby liked his brat as well. We loved the beans with hunks of meat in it & the potato salad was just ok, maybe a tad too sweet. Total for both meals was $15 & some change.  I saw on their website that they have all kinds of yummy meats, which for now are only available at Farmers Markets. But he told me that they are hoping to add them to their store early next year, can't wait for that!

I bought a Groupon about a week ago & decided to use it last Friday. I got the same things as before, pulled pork sandwich for me & brats (yes, he wanted 2!) for my hubby. They did add a few new sides, so in addition to beans I also got us the waffle fries. Everything was yummy as usual, I was missing the hunks of meat in my beans but hubby had some in his. I remembered to get some BBQ sauce this time, the sweet one was my fav! I also bought a pound of their bacon. I made it Sunday morning before the Superbowl & man was it good! I have to add that the place was a lot busier this time. It's good to see people supporting local businesses!

Still really like this place but was a bit bummed with part of my lunch order today. I decided to give their sweet potato fries a try & took my order to go. When I got home & opened up the box I found only about 6 sweet potato fries with my meal (see photo). Maybe they were running low & this is not the usual amount they serve, but I feel like I was jiped!

I love Yogurtini! There aren't many fro yo places in my area, so when I saw that this place opened up I had to try it out. I went last night & was pleasantly surprised with the wide variety of flavors & toppings.   I truly am a kid at heart so I got the following: peanut butter fro yo with chocolate & caramel syrup & peanut butter chips (would have gotten Reeses cups but they were out-boo) & cake batter fro yo with marshmallow topping & cookie dough. I got them both in the medium size containers so total was about $12.   I will definitely be back here frequently to try out all the other yummy flavors & toppings!

After hearing nothing but good things about Short Leash Dogs, I finally got to try them out for lunch yesterday. Every Wednesday during June & July (I think?) they are located at 335 W McDowell Rd (which is about a 2 minute drive from where I work) from 11am-1:30pm. My girlfriend Renee is in town for the summer so she met me there for some lunch & girl talk. We were warmly greeted by Brad (1 of the owners) & he explained it all since this was our 1st time. I decided on the Lady (chipotle cream cheese, sauteed onions & fried pickles) with a regular wiener, a bottle of good old fashioned coke & a corn pup for us to share. Renee decided on the weekly special Tyler (beef & bean chili, French's crunchy fried onions & cheddar cheese, sans the fried onions) with a regular wiener & a bottle of coke as well. We loved our wieners & the corn pup, so damn good! I loved that they used Naan bread instead of a bun, so clever! My only complaint was that I wished they used dill pickles on my wiener instead of the sweet ones. It was also a cute touch that they give you a lil dum dum sucker, brings me back to my childhood days. Total for 2 wieners, a corn pup & 2 bottled cokes was only $16 & some change, awesome deal. I will definitely be back!

My mom was sweet enough to take me to lunch today & told me to pick a place. I decided on That's A Wrap for a healthy lunch, since I am trying to loose weight & my awesome mom has already lost a bunch. She's my inspiration for sure!  We pull up & how funny is it that my brothers (who I work with) & dad were here also. Great minds think alike! There was a short line in the tiny restaurant. I ordered while my mom got us a table on their patio. Was it a gorgeous day in Phoenix or what?!  I got the My Sherry A'more wrap with fruit salad & my mom got The Veggie Jackson wrap & added tofu with pasta salad. We both enjoyed our wraps, the pasta salad was pretty good but the fruit salad was lacking. We also each got the homemade berry lemonade to drink, it was refreshing.  I'd definitely come back for lunch sometime. Would like to bring my hubby next time & try the Turk 182 wrap or the Baja rice bowl.

I picked up a to go order for lunch today. I was all set on ordering the Baja rice bowl, but then changed my mind last minute & ordered the Gringo Star wrap (w/chicken, no avocado). I was also thinking about getting their famous chips & salsa for my side, but I decided to go for the healthier fruit salad option. Oh & if you didn't notice I was trying to eat healthy today, so NOT getting a cookie or brownie that they had up by the register took LOTS of willpower! The wrap was so tasty, I almost finished it all. The fruit salad was ok, wish it had some grapes & strawberries. Total for my meal was a lil under $8.

It was my mom's birthday on Saturday & she picked this place for her bday dinner. This used to be Abuelo's (I miss that place!). The inside is very nice & the staff was friendly. We were seated right away because I had made reservations the day before. It was packed & very loud. I think the servers were a bit frazzled since they had just opened that week.   We started off with the calamari. It was delicious & not greasy at all. To our surprise we were brought another app. He brought it to our table & it was flambed table side. Some sort of cheese with a strong lemon flavor. My dad & I liked it but my mom & husband said it was gross. Apparently, it was meant for the table next to us. Not sure why they didn't say anything, just looked extremely pissed & left. Oh well!   For our entrees: my mom ordered moussaka, dad ordered roasted leg of lamb, hubby ordered shrimp kebabs & I ordered pastitsio. My dad had the best meal of us all, although the lamb was a bit over cooked because it was dry. My mom said hers was ok & mine was too, we had similar lasagna looking dishes. My hubs had the worst meal of us all. There was a strange smell & I could of swore it was someones dirty feet, nope it was his shrimp! I took one bite & almost spit it out, it tasted old & not fresh at all. Every dish came with a side of green beans, the tomato sauce they were covered in was not good, therefore ruining them. I also have to add that it took over 20 minutes for my husband to get the captain & coke he ordered. They finally brought it to the table after we were finished eating, he was annoyed to say the least.   I feel bad for this review considering they are a new restaurant but it was honestly one of the worst meals I've ever had. I would maybe go back & try their hummus or gyros but I don't know if that would be anytime soon, they have a lot to work on when it comes to the food.

This past Friday night my hubby was in the mood for Chinese. It was 8:45, so I figured it was too late to order from our usual spot, Flamingo Palace, since they close at 9. I had received Yu's menu on my doorstep a few months back & saw that they were open till 9:30 so I placed an order. We got the large cashew chicken (extra cashews), orange chicken (asked to make it not spicy) & beef & broccoli. Each came with a (small) side of white or fried rice & you could also get chow mein for $1 extra. We got 1 of each. We also got 2 chicken egg rolls & they had a coupon for free crab wontons, we also got a 2 liter of Dr. Pepper & some sugar covered donuts for dessert. The food was all very yummy & the price was right, about $32 for all that. The only complaint was that they did not include sweet & sour sauce, I have to have that stuff w/my crab wontons! Next time we order Chinese I think we will try Yu's again, sorry Flamingo Palace...

I was doing a lil shopping at Norterra & saw this cute store while I was down the way at Victoria's Secret & Bath & Body Works, I knew I had to take a peek. When I 1st walked in I was a little overwhelmed with all the merchandise. But as I walked around & looked at everything I was able to take it all in & had a lot of fun! I love that everything is color coordinated, every OCD persons dream! I had my hubby with me so I tried not to take too long, but I could seriously spend a couple hours in there. I didn't get much but I know I'll be back frequently. Picked up some cute, black chandelier earrings with a chunky necklace to match. Such great prices too, both items were less than $20. Can't wait to return!

I have only been to the Scottsdale location so when a girlfriend suggested the Desert Ridge location for our Girls Night I said why not?! On Saturday morning I spoke to an acquaintance on Facebook about getting a cabana & got it all set up. Fast forward to later that night around 11pm when me & a couple of my girlfriends finally show up. There's a line of course, (Cinco de Mayo weekend & some band was playing) but I let them know I had a cabana reserved under my name so we got to bypass the line & didn't have to pay cover either. We get to the cabana & there are about 12 girls already there. I didn't know about half of them but whatev! Our server (never got her name) was sweet but very shy/quiet & sometimes reallllllly slow about getting us our drink orders & when we wanted to cash out. It was so packed that night & there were so many douche bags running around, that I was pretty much confined to our cabana. Thankfully my girls can keep me entertained because I had a great time! I ordered vodka cranberries all night which seemed weak at first, until I started ordering doubles. Needless to say I got pretty drunk after my 4th drink. Since we booked a cabana our group had to spend a combined total of $450, my bill came out to $63 & I left her $85. I just hope the other bitches in my group tipped her well also! Btw, I put my debit card down to start my tab but when I closed out I paid with cash. I checked my bank account online today & it showed a charge for Sandbar pending. I called them to see why it was still there & they said it should be gone within the next 3 days. Kind of annoying but understandable & just an FYI to anyone else who puts a card down but pays in cash. Any way, a lot of my friends like it here so I'm sure I'll be back eventually!

It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon & my husband & I decided to have lunch somewhere on a patio. I suggested Rico's since I had been wanting to try it for a lil while now & we made our way over. We walked in & the hostess brought us out to the back patio. It was a cute lil area with a few tables, a ping pong table, couches & a fire place for colder weather. Some of the cushions had bird shit on em & the taller tables were a bit wobbly, but no biggie, we sat at a shorter table & avoided the dirty chair cushions.   I felt like having a beer so I ordered the Sun Up Armadillo & opted for a pitcher. I should have just stuck to a small glass since I had never tried it before, we did not care for it. For an app we ordered the jumbo pretzel off of the bar menu. For $8 I thought they could have included 1 or 2 more, but they were yummy & the queso it came with was delish. For our entrees my hubby ordered the Rico's dip & I ordered their signature steak (med-rare) & fries. He loved his sandwich (enough for 2) & the house-made kettle chips were amazing. My new york strip with chimichurri sauce was excellent & the fries were tasty as well. I have to add that they also make their own ketchup (that has a bit of a kick to it) & is great with the fries & even the chips.   Total (not including tip) was about $62, a lil pricey but the food was great so we'd definitely return. They have happy hour everyday from 3-7 with some awesome deals, so I'd like to return during hh & also sit at the patio up front which had a lot more shade & tables.

Back in August, I was wanting to get a massage so I asked my girlfriend Jenny if she had any good but affordable recs. She suggested Suzanne & I called right away to try & make an appt for that wknd. Unfortunately, she was already booked but had an opening the following Sunday, so I immediately took the spot for a 90 min classic massage.   I had a lil trouble finding the location but I called Suzanne & she was able to guide me, even with my horrible direction skills-I am by a, uh building with balconies. Lol bless her heart!   Suzanne is very personable & makes you feel at ease. We spoke some during my massage but not too much where I couldn't enjoy it. She applied the right amount of pressure for my preference & I was in heaven the entire time.   My 2nd experience with Suzanne was late September, my mom got me a massage as a gift. This time I chose the lava shell massage. If you have ever experienced a hot stone massage, this is similar. But in my opinion so much better!   I am going to try & see Suzanne once a month or at least every other month. I used to think massages were not necessary & just too expensive, but that was before I experienced Time For You with the amazing Suzanne! :)   *Also, she has a website with a ton of info on it: www.timeforu.net

*I made a page back in July for this location, but whenever I try to check in this is the only Chipotle that shows up so whatev!  I have loved Chipotle for many years now. I even have one of their shirts that say "Addicted" on it.   I have been to 6 Chipotle locations in the valley & loved them all. But I love this location the most now because it is less than 5 minutes from my house, yay! I don't think they have been open for more than 2 weeks, which explains why they're a little slow but the employees here are friendly & generous with the portions.   My Hubby & I get the same thing every time, bowls! His: chicken, rice, pinto beans, fajita veggies, a lil tomato salsa, cheese & lettuce. Mine: steak, EXTRA rice, no beans & EXTRA tomato salsa. Yummy in our tummies!!

It's been a while since I've had In N Out, so yesterday I decided to stop by for lunch. I had been to the dentist earlier that morning & my teeth were still hurtin, so I decided to avoid any long drive thru lines & go after the lunch rush at about a quarter till 2pm. When I pulled up there was still a bit of a wait, about 6 or 7 cars were in front of me. I can only imagine how long that line gets at noon! Any way, I ordered a #2 animal style with a dr. pepper. Everything was so tasty & I finished it all! Total for a cheeseburger, medium drink & fries was less than 6 bucks, so awesome. Best fast food burger by far!  P.S. I love how pleasant the employees working at In N Out are, it's very refreshing :)

I had seen the construction going on at Poblano's for the past 9 months or so now. I knew I had to try it, once construction was completed. A couple months ago, I believe, the sign said Poblano's Gourmet Tacos with a pic of a poblano pepper, but I guess they changed their minds. It looks like they did a complete remodel of the place. I had never been in the place that occupied it before Poblano's, but everything looked brand new. They have a giant menu screen when you 1st walk in (think Pei Wei-ish). They also had large windows so you could see into the kitchen, I really dug that.   I decided on the carne asada tacos & I made it a combo with rice & beans & added a drink. I asked the girl at the counter what came on the tacos & she mentioned avocado slices. I told her to please hold those & that I'd like pico de gallo added. She gave me the #7 & I waited for my number to be called. About 10 minutes later she brought my food out to me & I returned to work.   When I got to my office I discovered that they gave me an entire bowl of pico, I just wanted a lil added to my tacos! I then noticed that there was guac on my tacos, wish she had mentioned that guac was also on them because I would have told her to hold that too. The tacos were pretty good & a huge portion. I ordered 2 & could have easily been satisfied with 1. I have to say their meat was very tender & well seasoned. The rice & beans were pretty good as well.   The prices seemed decent when scanning the menu, but somehow my taco combo plate & drink came out to $13.50! Was that huge side of pico $5?! Any way, I do like that this is a local, family owned business & their food was pretty good, so I think they deserve 4 stars. I'm sure I'll be returning for lunch during the week, since they are a 2 minute drive from my work. I also like that they have a drive thru, very convenient.

My hubby has been wanting to buy a vaporizer for a couple months now, so this past Saturday around 9:30pm we decided to go check some out. He had heard that this place recently opened & wanted to take a look. This place was well lit & had a huge selection of pieces, bongs & hookahs. We saw a few vaporizers in the display case & asked the dude working there about them. Then shortly into our convo the manager came out & introduced himself. They were both very helpful & knowledgeable. We ended up buying one & the manager gave us $5 off. A couple things I thought were pretty cool: the humidifier room with cigars & wraps & the huge, stone fountain/waterfall in the back of the shop that they said would be completed soon. Oh & above the humidifier room & fountain/waterfall were the address looking #s 420, nice. We'll definitely be back!

I have been tanning here since high school. Some employees can be a little pushy when it comes to selling packages, points & lotions. But overall the staff here is great. I used to pay for the unlimited monthly packages in the regular beds, but after a while I stopped getting color out of them so I canceled it & just started buying points. Beds range from about 40-70 points per visit. The Ellipse, Powerhouse & Ergoline 600/650 are my favorite beds to use. Last week I bought 1,000 points & an awesome new lotion I can't wait to use. They also let you split the payments, so I am paying half next Friday & the other half two Fridays from then, I love that you can do that. I prefer the Tatum & Shea location, but this location is closer to my house so I frequent it the most.

My hubby was hungry after having a few drinks so we went out looking for something to eat. Everything was closed since it was past 11pm, except for fast food, so that was pretty much our only option. Hubby insisted on going to Burger King & got himself the chicken nuggets meal & for me the chicken fries meal. He was pretty tipsy so he downed his whole meal, but I was sober as can be & could only stomach about half. The fries were barely warm & way too crunchy. The chicken fries were so thick w/coating & just overall disgusting. The sweet & sour sauce I got w/them didn't help either, way too sugary sweet. Needless to say, if my hubby insists on coming here again out of drunkenness I am not ordering anything!

This is our go to Fry's. We know the layout well & usually find good deals on items we need (& don't need). The parking can sometimes suck. Cashiers are friendly. Prefer this location over the 19th ave & Union one. My 1 complaint is that their meat department is seriously lacking! Usually only pick up ground turkey meat here, for all other meat products we go to Costco.
