Chico's Tacos is kind of the queenly sister of the chain Mexican restaurants peppered around Phoenix like so many grains of sand in your swimsuit. It is clearly several steps up from your local generic Mexican drive through, but it's still just not tasty.  This fact does not dissuade me from visiting Chico's on a semi-kinda-regular basis - it is close to my work, and the wait is generally minimal.  Please keep in mind that my experience is only a reflection of a typical "lunch rush" Chico's environment - the atmosphere is probably different most other times of the day, but I imagine that my observations on the food will hold true regardless of the hour.  A quick-talking girl at the counter will hustle and bustle you into making your order as speedily as possible, and will then hand you a slip of paper with your order number on it. We all know how this game goes - hang out, and wait for said number to be called.   If you need to be in-and-out quickly, this is a good time to fill up a few little plastic cups with salsa for the road - there is a salsa bar with probably 5 or 6 salsas to choose from, and there will be no salsa already included with your to-go order. I like the salsa bar...it's always clean and well-stocked, and all of the salsas have a good flavor.  Your order will include a meager serving of restaurant-made (but not quite warm and delicious) tortilla chips.  I have ordered many things at Chico's, and, okay, I understand - it's a Mexican "grilled" platter, or the entree includes "grilled' chicken, but does everything need to be blackened and charred and dry to the point of an unusual "crunch"? This is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in. Doused in copious amount of salsa, it's not too bad, but I can't imagine straight-up muching on it without that extra step of preparation.  The rice is good. I can't comment on the beans, because I don't eat them!  The inside of the restaurant is cute - much nicer than your usual chain, reflete with wooden parrots and brightly-colored tiles. Something about the inside of the building makes it very loud inside at lunchtime - not a spot to sit and bring a book and contemplate the mysteries of and the reality of your newly found adulthood...not that I've, you know, tried that...or anything...

This one is really hard.   Based on other Yelp reviews, I went to Eliana's to pick up lunch last week. It's close to my work, and it sounded like such a nice departure from my usual lunchtime rounds. This past weekend, my boyfriend and I went to dinner there, because I thought it deserved a second try. I'll tell you a little about both experiences.   After perusing all of the (mostly) helpful and honest reviews here, I really psyched myself out about giving it a try and just HAD to go there for takeout that VERY SAME DAY - I'm not a delayed gratification kind of person, despite my best efforts. I ended up at the restaurant at around 11:00, and it was empty. The lady behind the counter seemed a little frosty at first, but then she started in with calling me "mija," and I was a goner. I'm not sure why, but some little, older lady calling me a term of motherly endearment always softens me right up.   I ordered the Pollo Encebollado, described in the menu only as "chicken with onions." Hm. Well, I like chicken, and I like onions...so...that sounded pretty good! I was imagining something akin to an El Salvadorian fajita. As I picked up my order and drove back to work to enjoy it at my desk, visions of chunks of seasoned chicken and sauteed onions danced through my head. I settled down at my desk, took a deep breath, opened the nicely wrapped Styrofoam container, and...chicken on the bone? What? Who said anything about chicken on the bone? With some reddish, tomatoey-looking sauce? What is this? Where are the delicious, unauthentic strips of white meat chicken? The browned onions, all oily and slippery? THIS ISN'T FAJITAS!   Well, no. It isn't fajitas...fajitas are somewhere else on the menu. This is Pollo Encebollado, and I didn't know what I was ordering. Pollo Encebollado, at Eliana's, is two drumsticks covered in a flavorful, tomato-based sauce, paired with a few cooked onion slices. The meal includes rice, beans, and tortillas, but I went for double rice, which is kind of yellow in color and studded with chopped carrots and onions. The tortillas are like fat little pancakes that taste like tortillas, if that's not a completely ignorant description.   I don't generally eat chicken on the bone, but, hey. I ordered it, I was really wanting to try it, so I broke a personal rule and dove in. While it wasn't quite what I had imagined, I liked it well enough and was able to finish it.   I wasn't sure what to think. I wasn't too into it...definitely not enough to order that same thing again, but I didn't want to write Eliana's off completely, based merely on some weird, prissy, arbitrary issue I have with chicken on the bone.   I told my boyfriend about the restaurant, and suggested that we go try it out together. He had actually heard of it before from a Salvadorian coworker who raves about it frequently.  We went on a Friday evening at around 5:00...the restaurant was, again, nearly empty. A very friendly man seated us and took our drink orders.   I first tried the Orchata, which was very different from the Mexican variety I'm sure most of us are familiar with. It was actually a milky brown in color, rather than white...it looked, to me, like a glass of chocolate milk. The color, I found out later, comes from the addition of an ingredient called Morrow Seed. It also tastes a little different, in a way that is hard to explain...I'd also probably chalk that up to the Morrow Seed.   For our entrees, my boyfriend had the Chile Relleno, and I ordered the Arroz a la Valenciana...mostly because it is painted on the outside of the restaurant, and seems to be their "hallmark" dish.   Note: before your order arrives, you receive a salty little cup of chicken soup. I wasn't too into the soup itself, but I was oddly touched by the effort to add a little something extra and a little something nice to the dining experience. Maybe I'm a sappy weirdo. Well, not maybe, I definitely am, but between the "mija"s and the cute little soups, I felt very charmed by the man and woman working there, and really, really wanted to enjoy my food so I could write a big, long review on Yelp about how wonderful their restaurant is.   Neither my boyfriend or I really enjoyed either of our dishes. My dish was served cold, which I wasn't expecting, and seemed very flavorless to me...other than the unusual taste of bananas I seemed to pick up from the rice. The man helping us suggested that I pour the bean substance on my dish to "create a new flavor." I thought this was also a really cute thing to say, but, unfortunately, I followed his advice and did not enjoy the "new flavor" I created. All in all, I enjoyed the Arroz a la Valenciana much less than the Pollo Encebollado.  Annnnd I'm out of characters. If you want to hear about the Chile Relleno or the Ensalada beverage, message me!

My man loves beer, but we both hate bars. That's why this classy little beauty less than a mile away from our house was a definite must-try. Let me begin the review by letting you know, up front, that we really enjoyed everything about the place. Minimal complaints!   We visited Sonora on a Friday at around 7:00...there were a few parking spots left in what is really a very ample parking lot for downtown Phoenix. I mean, damn! There must be at least 20 spaces. I'm a worrier and I stress out about things like, "WHERE WILL WE PARK?!" before I go anywhere. I know...I know. So, I was pleased to see that I needn't have gifted myself with an ulcer over where we could park without getting towed or ending up on blocks.   Sonora Brewhouse is comprised of two buildings, joined by an outside dining area between them. The building you first walk into, (the older building, I perhaps incorrectly surmised), is small and was filled with many jovial patrons on our visit. We wouldn't have wanted to sit at the bar, but we couldn't have, anyway! It was completely full, as were almost all of the booths and tables. We made our way to the outside seating area, and were about to sit down when we noticed the second building...right on the other side of the outdoor seating. We ventured in, and it was much less full than the other building, but several times as noisy. Oh, well. We sat down and surveyed our new environs.   I've read several reviews on here vaguely bashing the ambiance of the restaurant - I found nothing to complain about. Then again, I like faux exposed-brick walls and dark wood paneling. "Duly noted." Alright, cool. Thanks. I also liked the kind of fun, amateurish canvas paintings of the images they pair with each of their beers that are strewn about said exposed-brick walls. Plasma TVs abound, which I hate, but I know people eat that technology crap up so I guess it's worth mentioning.   Our waitress was just friendly enough, avoided all bitchiness, and was on top of things without being obnoxious. In other words, perfect. My boyfriend ordered the pale ale, (I think it's called The Stinger? Something like that?), and I, not a beer drinker in the slightest, decided to throw caution and personal preference to the wind and have a Vanilla Porter. Because, you know. It would taste like vanilla. And...vanilla is for girls. Like me. That don't drink beer. My boyfriend chuckled at this logic, and told me I wouldn't like it and that I didn't know what I was ordering.   ...   Yep. Just about right. As far as beer goes, I did like the kind of bitter and still beer-like hint of baked goods flavor, but it was not anything like I cluelessly imagined. I still drank it! My boyfriend really enjoyed his pale ale with no criticisms.   My boyfriend ordered the Tavern Steak with steamed vegetables and steak fries, and I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich with the kettle chips/chipotle ketchup. We were both very pleased with our entrees...the jalapeno butter (?) on the steak is pretty tasty. As for the sandwich, I'll eat anything if it is slathered in guacamole. The steak fries were as good as steak fries ever are, and the kettle chips are as good as all of the other reviews have told you. I don't eat potato chips and I hate ketchup, but I loved the combination here. Fun tip: I tried putting some of the chipotle ketchup on my sandwich, and it tasted really gross. Maybe limit your use of the ketchup to its intended, menu-endorsed purpose.   When we were done, we had no problem getting the bill, paying the bill, and getting out. The parking lot was completely full when we left, and there were two cars jockeying for our spot. That was probably around 8:00 - 8:30 PM, so if you're a damaged individual like me who finds cause to stress about parking, go earlier than that.   There were a lot of other options on the menu that sounded like they might be on the "delicious" side. If you are like us, and not into the drama-filled 20-something bar scene downtown, this might be a nice alternative. It's so close, and we were both really down with the experience...we will definitely be back.

Let me just say that, despite what you may have been lead to believe, I am not that cool. I still think Alanis Morissette is cool. I still wear black and pink sometimes. That is how uncool I am. I am not cool, and will probably never be cool, by the exacting standards of Buffalo Exchange.   I know this. I knew this. But I cleaned out my closet and ended up with a stack of mostly designer duds that no longer made me feel fancy... it was time for me to brave the arctic wilderness of shirts with pearl snap buttons and dresses with cowboy boots that is Buffalo Exchange.  I see that some reviewers are a little insecure about their coolness. "They didn't take my stuff! I hate them!", or, "I didn't have enough body mods to be considered an indie badass! Eff those heartless hipster drones!"   Listen, dudes. Who really cares what some icy jerk at Buffalo Exchange thinks about you, or thinks about your clothes? I already know that I am not cool enough for Buffalo Exchange. That is why I was stolid and unsurprised to receive little more than a dismissive grunt from any of the buyers/sales staff working there today. Actually, one of them did call me "honey" at one point. I liked that.   While the gentleman at the "buy" counter was perusing my stuff, I wandered around and saw a lot of cute things, some outrageously priced and others, very reasonable. I saw a few shirts that I've purchased at Last Chance over the last 6 months hanging on the racks there, for triple what I bought them for. I also saw some cute designer shoes, jeans, and dresses at prices that are truly a steal and a half. Really cute accessories, too. I had to use major restraint in that department.   They took, like, 3 items out of the multitude of junk that I hauled over there. I wasn't itchin' for a fix or trying to pay a bill or needing to buy baby formula or whatever other reason there is that people might complain about the amount they're receiving for their clothes. I took my sweet $16.50 in trade, and peaced.   Was anybody nice to me? Not really. Did that make me feel bad? Nope! Avoid Buffalo Exchange if you have a fragile ego, and if inscrutable, potentially unfriendly facial expressions bother you. If you're just there for the deals, and couldn't care less about the trappings, you will probably spend $20 on something cute and go home and feel a little bit cooler.

My boyfriend is kind of a down home, "we love Amurrica" kind of guy, It's part of his charm, it's what I love about him, but the kind of cuisine that accompanies this quality isn't my cup of tea. I rarely eat red meat. I avoid fried foods whenever possible. That being said, I like to see my man happy - a knife in one hand, a fork in the other, and a big plate of Western goodness between the two.   TEXAZ seemed perfect. I read reviews, (not on Yelp, unfortunately), scoped out the location, and surprised him by taking him there a few months ago.   I, for one, loved the atmosphere. It was loud, a little rowdy, and filled to the ceiling with junk! An eclectic assortment of ephemera clung to the walls, accented with knick-knacks and taxidermied animals here and there. Imagine the inside of an Applebee's, except 10 times darker and decorated with items people actually accumulated over time, not stuff that came out of some corporate "wacky interiors!" starter kit.   The waitress was pleasant, but inattentive. The portions were huge, but bland. Even the biscuits were especially boring, and it's hard to make a buttermilk biscuit any more boring than it naturally is, just by existing. I tried to score some honey mustard to liven up my tasteless chicken entree, but no go - no sauces were available! What?! Even my boyfriend seemed less than thrilled by his big ol' meaty hunk of meat, served with a side of some bland starch or another. My boyfriend also found the beer selection to be lacking, but I can't vouch for the accuracy of this observation as I do not care about beer in the slightest.   For what it was, it was pricey. I felt like we could've gone to almost any other sit-down restaurant in a 2 mile radius and had a better experience for less cash.   We left full, but with nothing good to say other than "my, that was a lot of food." Hardly ringing praise for a $50+ dinner bill. I don't think we'll be back...the lure of the 1970s concert posters and deer skulls isn't enough to justify a second visit.

Okay, seriously. I'm obsessed. I don't even care about designer brands that much...and I'm obsessed. When I can buy a lingerie top by Vera Wang for less than I can buy one by Xhiliration...yeah, I'm there.   In fact, I am so there that....(I can't believe I'm about to reveal this)...I have created a spreadsheet.   A spreadsheet to keep track of my deals.   Yes. I am for real. And, according to my calculations, I have saved over $2000 in shopping at Last Chance over the last 6 months.   I don't find something every time I go, but I also go (gulp) every day, with the exception of weekends. I work and live nearby, so it's easy for me to take 45 minutes out of my day and poke around over there.   I mostly buy tops, shoes, jewelery, and cosmetics.   Last Chance has a vast, ever-replenishing supply of cute tops. Some are designer, some are just Nordstrom filler brands...about 45% of them are something you might want to buy. The others, you will discard due to condition and personal taste. Tops range from $2.97 - $9.97, and there are often 25% - 50% off "deal days".   Shoes are also marked way, way down - my current "personal best" shoe bargain is a pair of Kate Spade wedges for $14.99. This takes some digging, but it is almost always worth squeezing through the aisles and taking a look. Keep an eye out for the sales they have on certain color tags - they often mark a random tag color down 50% for a few days out of the week.   Jewelry and hair accessories are usually not designer, but you can occasionally find something with a recognizable name on it - a few months ago, I found a Marc Jacobs necklace for $9.97. Designer or not, you can find cute stuff for next to nothing, just to fill up your jewelry box. They also have a good, rotating selection of headbands and hair clips, if that's your thing. Be sure to check out the motley displays by the register to increase your chances of finding that special designer necklace or ring on huge clearance.   It is a little known fact that Last Chance occasionally has jaw-dropping deals on high-end, UNUSED cosmetics. Most of the time when you go in there looking for cosmetics, you'll find a half-empty bottle of crusty tinted moisturizer laying on its side, leaking onto the counter a little bit. Said bottle will be priced at something ridiculous, like $14.97, and you will be disgusted. HOWEVER, every now and again, every once in the bluest of moons, you will walk in the door and find a basket of brand new Stila lip pots. Or maybe Smashbox blushes. Or even Duwop eye palettes... for $.97. Ninety-seven cents. Truly.   As far as the claims of shopping violence, aggressiveness, and cattiness...I have experienced none of these things. I have also witnessed none of these things, and, like I revealed earlier in this somewhat humbling review, I go every day. Honestly, I don't even feel that the shopping environment is any more competitive than in any other discount retail store. No one has ever snatched anything out of my hands, or tried to get me to move. People are a little pushy, but that happens everywhere - just lock your knees, and stand your ground!   I never feel stressed out or overwhelmed shopping there, but, then again, I am an old hand at it these days. I took my boyfriend recently, (it was his first time), and he was completely overwhelmed moments after we entered the store. It gets crowded, there are running and screaming kids, and things end up on the floor - welcome to Ross. If you can handle discount shopping elsewhere, you can handle it here. Don't believe the hype, don't fear the horror stories, and soon you, too, will have your own embarrassing bargain tracker spreadsheet.

Chino Bandido is amazing. There are never any surprises, you always know what you're getting, and it's always super speedy and super delicious.   HOWEVER - a caveat to consider: similar to any place where you "make your own" entree or combination, a certain amount of the burden of flavor can be said to fall upon you and your choices. Just sayin'!  Chino Bandido is a grungy little hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the "grunge" factor comes from age, rather than neglect. Inside, it is brightly lit with sparse but funky decorations...including a big statue of their mascot, an angry-looking panda bear in a sombrero and bullet belt, chopsticks in one hand and a bowl of rice in the other.   From this brief description of their mascot, I'm sure you've caught on to Chino Bandido's gimmick - Chinese-Mexican fusion.   There is no need to go into some long and theoretical discussion of whether this is a good idea or not  - make the drive, make an order, and make your stomach smile. The food is inexpensive, tasty, and portioned very generously.   While it is not complicated to order once you're there and looking at the order form, it would be hard to explain here. Luckily, their website has an awesome, (and very helpful) Menu Demo tool that shows you exactly how the ordering process works, complete with a rough picture representation of what your combo order looks like. This feature on their website alone was enough to impress me into a first visit, and what I found when I arrived was more than convincing enough to keep me coming back.   Ask to sample something, if you're not sure! They will be happy to oblige you. On my first visit, they even made me go through a whole taste-test thing, where the boy behind the counter had me sample a variety of meats and rices from the menu so I'd have an idea of what I might like. This, however, was at the Chandler location, so I'm not sure if this first-time policy carries over to the Phoenix location.   Some of my favorite things to order are the Jade Red Chicken (in a quesadilla, especially - I'd say this is a MUST TRY), the Emerald Chicken, and the Jerk Chicken, (also best in a quesadilla). The jerk fried rice is delicious, and the other rice varities are good, too. The only thing I've ever tried there that I didn't love was the Pollo Diablo, which was dry, crusty, and...just didn't taste good. My boyfriend loves the Chile Relleno, and, while i'm normally not into that dish at other restaurants, I've been known to sneak a bite or two of his here. :)  A soft and sweet snickerdoodle cookie is included with every order, and, on the weekends, you can even sub it out for a "special order" weekend cookie - I've only tried one of these, and it was a chocolate brownie cookie which was just as good as the phenomenal snickerdoodles.   So, give it a try. Get it to go. Chances are, you'll love it, and if you don't, you're out less than $10. Take a walk on the wild side; find your inner angry-panda-with-a-sombrero. It's kind of cool, having a fu manchu.

Well, it happened. Somewhere along the way, I turned 23. It happened without fanfare, or angels descending from the heavens with rare Tori Amos bootlegs. In fact, it passed quietly, with a certain stately dignity, marked only by the receipt of some not-so-modest gifts and some co-workers taking me (and a few other co-workers with October birthdays) to Chelsea's Kitchen for lunch. Oh, and my boyfriend baked me a cake. And decorated it. And is the most wonderful and amazing boyfriend, ever. But this isn't his review, so the lovebird shout-outs stop here. I promise.  Chelsea's Kitchen is just "the cuteness." I know that, unlike my birthday, the phrase "the cuteness" is devoid of all dignity. I know this. But, the fact remains: Chelsea's Kitchen is "the cuteness." The landscaping and decorative touches outside, (the little pond! the lovely patio), to the bright and rich interior...I pretty much knew I'd like it when we were walking up. Note: many reviews mention that it is a cutthroat parking situation during lunchtime. My work caravan arrived at around 12:15, and parking was easy. Maybe we were lucky. Maybe it's not actually that bad most of the time. I don't know!  Our waiter was friendly and courteous, and attentive without being overbearing. He kept the Arnold Palmers coming, which was much appreciated. Speaking of the Arnold Palmers, they were awesome. I know it's just lemonade and iced tea with a wrinkled little mint leaf floating on top, but, damn. I was hitting them, and I was hitting them hard. I might've just been in a cheery mood and feeling overly generous, but they were totally the tastiest Arnold Palmers I've ever had.   I eat red meat very sparingly, but the Green Chile Burger was too tempting to pass up. And, guess what. I ordered it...medium well! My mother instilled me with a fear of Ecoli so strong and persistent that I have never ordered a burger or any other cut of meat without making sure that it would be "well done." This was a momentous occasion, but I kept my triumph to myself. Why share my crazy with my innocent co-workers? Gotta save this weird shit for Yelp.   The burger was delicious. I don't really even like burgers, and I thought it was super tasty. The fries are seasoned, crisp, and equally tasty. Paired with an Arnold Palmer from the gods, I was a happy little birthday clam. The desserts were tempting, but we were all stuffed and ready to head back to the daily grind. Even the kids menu looked pretty good. PBJ sushi? Cuteness! "The cuteness," to be exact.  Pricey for lunch, but worth it, I think. I can't wait to bring my boyfriend.

I went to Carly's twice in one day yesterday. You say "fatass," I say "devoted to understanding the multi-faceted nature of the dining establishment." We're speaking the same language.   The first time was for a somewhat awkward and stilted department lunch...the second time, it was all about hitting up happy hour. Both experiences were excellent.   Lunch - I had the prosciutto sandwich. Absolutely delicious. The sweetness of the fig spread, the saltiness of the prosciutto, the delectable crunch of the bread...I was planning on being a lady and consuming only a delicate half, but was overcome and unable to resist the lure of the remaining portion. As other reviewers have mentioned, you receive only the barest smidgen of orzo. It's good, but, you know...blink, and you might miss that you were even eating it.   The service was slower than I would have imagined for how empty it was at the time we went, but our server was friendly and kind. No hassle about splitting our bill 6 different ways, which is always nice to avoid. Also...one of our dining companions was an adult affected by autism. He had brought his own lunch to eat into the restaurant, which obviously isn't appropriate, but the waitress handled it very gracefully and patiently answered all of his questions with a smile and no trace of an eyeroll. For me, that was what cinched a second visit.   Happy hour -  We ordered the hummus duo, (olive tapenade, a generous portion of hummus, an equally generous collection of pita wedges, and chips) , the brie appetizer (a wedge of brie, a sweet onion...something? chutney?, walnuts, cranberries, apple slices, and delicious bread), and the Carly Q. All were excellent...daydreaming about that brie appetizer right now. No cocktails this time.   Service was, again, on the slower side, but nobody was a pretentious asshole or anything. In fact, nary a pretentious asshole was to be found. Maybe you only see them when you're obsessively looking for them so you can insert a scathing one-two punch into your Yelp review they will never read or give a shit about.   Just sayin'.

So, we went back. And it was awesome.  We went on a weeknight, and, true to my review, I went whole hog, (no pun intended), and ordered a 2 Meat Barbecue Combo plate - the sausage link, and beef brisket. My boyfriend, ever steady, ordered the Prime Rib.   Now, I don't really eat red meat. I mention this in a lot of reviews, and that mention is usually followed by "...but this time, I did, and I loved it." So, I guess I do actually eat red meat now. Wacky. Thanks, Yelp, for contributing to the decay of my health and the fatty deposits inside my arteries. Do you even get fatty deposits in your arteries? Don't mind me, I'm just flaunting my lack of basic anatomical knowledge on the internet. Anyway, the beef brisket was awesome, and the sausage link was truly one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Really! I loved it. Tasty and smokey and sweetly tinged with barbecue sauce. The corn and the shoestring fries are still hanging out in the "delicious" zone, and my boyfriend once again wolfed down his prime rib like a champ. He also tossed out a compliment to his side of macaroni and cheese, saying that it was "really good." From him, that is a ringing endorsement.  Our server was sweet and efficient, and not at all obnoxious. A+, Sawyer! You were great.  The little bag of Thank-Q doughnuts was adorable...we didn't get those on our first visit, and, even though we were completely stuffed, we appreciated the gesture and somehow found the digestive strength to scarf them down on the way home.  Thanks for a wonderful night, Jason. Your customer service is out of this world.

My boyfriend works at the pawn shop next door, (not nearly as seedy as it looks - stop in and buy some junk!), and I love middle eastern food - those two cardinal reasons are what prompted me to visit the Middle Eastern Bakery, and I have never been disappointed by anything...except for the parking and the long waits.   The falafel is delicious...some of the best I've ever had, and while I do not consider myself to be a connoisseur, I do consider myself to be relatively well-versed in the arts of falafel! I love the lemonade. The hummus is probably the only thing I am not crazy about...it is pretty basic, without a lot of accouterments and extra ingredients. This might really do it for you, but I have developed an unfortunate taste for hummus that is less authentic and more "fancy."   Parking is difficult at almost anytime of the day, because the businesses right there, (the pawn shop, the Middle Eastern Bakery and the antique store), have their own parking lots but experience overflow from the other businesses frequently. Pawn shop customers park in the Middle Eastern Bakery lot, and vice-versa. However, don't be discouraged by a full front lot! There is a large (if a little forbidding-looking) parking lot behind the Middle Eastern Bakery - it is perfectly fine to park there and walk through the little alley to the Bakery.   Esam, the man who owns/runs the Middle Eastern Bakery, is very friendly and funny. If you visit often, he will remember you and will often surprise you with fun freebies - I have received more free halva than I could ever eat. You will receive more charming and personalized service if you go when it is slow, (morning time, after 1:00 PM), but I have never seen him be curt or unfriendly.   Speaking of slow vs. busy times - if you are going there at any time close to your lunch break, you will find it to be very busy. There are usually two long, discouraging lines - one, of people ordering their food, and the second of people waiting to receive the food they've ordered. It can be overwhelmingly crowded at times, and it has been a rare occasion that I've made it in and out in under half an hour. If you have a long lunch, good for you! Head over there. If not, maybe wait to try the Middle Eastern Bakery on your day off.   If you are a hookah enthusiast, they have a small assortment of shisha and hookah accessories for sale. They also sell a variety of middle eastern products and knick-knacks.

The Nile Cafe is very, very small.   Very.   I mean, really, the place is teeny-tiny...but it doesn't matter much. It's also usually empty.   When I first started working downtown, I didn't know where anything was. I had no idea where to head for lunch, with the exception of the Jack in the Box across the street from my building...and that was just not going to do. Driving around on 7th St., one of the first beacons of possible culinary delight winked at me from the corner of Roosevelt - The Nile Cafe. I love Mediterranean cuisine, so I made time to stop.   I've actually visited the Nile Cafe several times, and the experiences are always so different from one another. The food is consistently okay, with two marked exceptions - the delicious artichoke hummus, and the absolutely terrible falafel.   The service is where the big gap resides. There is one man who works there, (I perceive him as being the owner, although I have no actual reason to think this), who is very kind and courteous. He is patient, attentive, and soft-spoken but also friendly. Everyone else who works there is disinterested to the point of rudeness. Blank stares, no verbal acknowledgement...it is very uncomfortable to dine in, and, honestly, a little uncomfortable to order out.   I go back occasionally to fulfill my desire for artichoke hummus. Other places make this, but none are as full of chunky goodness as their variety. Some of their soups are tasty, and almost everything else on the menu is typical Mediterranean fare - not bad, not great, and capable of hitting the spot if you're in the right mood. The falafel is baked, not fried - being moderately health conscious, I thought I would enjoy this change in preparation. I didn't. Falafel just needs to crunch, man!  If you're going to try the Nile Cafe, order out. It is so rarely busy -  you can be in and out in less than 15 minutes, unless you neglect to fill up your meter's belly and your car gets towed.

I had the prosciutto sandwich, and it was delicious. That's all I'm going to say about the food.   Dude, the service...it sucked. I am low maintenance, and am equipped with low expecations to match, and it still sucked. All I need is a smile and maybe, I don't know, a polite greeting of some kind, and I am satisfied in the service department. Totally didn't happen here.   The restaurant, per its website and posted hours, opens at 10:00 AM. I can't imagine anyone actually goes there that early, but, okay. It's when they open.   Now, as anyone who has worked downtown for more than a week knows, if you want to go somewhere and get in and out and back to your desk in a manageable amount of time, you need to adjust your lunch time aim - shoot for 11:30, or shoot for 1:30. Anything in between will only bring you lines, misery, and a bitch of a time parking...especially on 7th Street.   So, I mosied on over to La Piccola Cucina at exactly 11:20...an hour and twenty minutes after they opened, mind. I walked in, and was greeted by a scowling, irritated-looking girl at front counter in a hot pink sweatshirt and super tight black pants, (the owner's daughter, I was able to ascertain from newspaper clippings posted on the restaurant walls). She looked at me and said, in a very put-upon tone...are you ready for this..."Yeah? What do you need?"  "Yeah? What do you need?" You're working at a restaurant...it's 11:30 at this point...I've approached the counter to order...and you're copping an attitude like you can't possibly imagine what I would be doing there? Right. Keep on keepin' on, girl. DIVA FOR LIFE!  I said, "Um...I'd like to order something to go..." No menus are to be seen...I later discovered that the sandwich menu is posted on the wall somewhere, but this wasn't pointed out to me. Good thing I read some Yelp reviews before I went, so I had some idea of what was available...oh, PS - the gelato cases and the food cases were empty. Totally empty.   Avoiding eye contact with me, she fumbled with a bunch of papers by the register, still looking completely annoyed by my existence,."Uh, we're not even really OPEN yet." I look behind me at the clock on the wall, and the front door that is propped open all the way. I had no idea how to respond to that, so I didn't. Just awkwardly stood there till she took my order.   I ordered the prosciutto sandwich, no wilted greens. Of course, it came with wilted greens, which would be forgivable if I hadn't been treated like a leper. While I was waiting, another couple came in and was helped by the owner's wife...food/gelato cases were still empty, and she wasn't super friendly, but she at least acknowledged them as human beings and pointed out where the menus were.  The owner, so often immortalized in Yelp reviews as a loud, friendly, brusque gentleman, just kind of lumbered around the restaurant, frowning, without a smile or word for anyone.  My sandwich was awesome, but there are too many other mom-n'-pops downtown to even bother giving business to a place where the staff cops an attitude. Really and truly. Sucks for them, because I'm the kind of person who goes back to a place over and over again, and tries everything. I tell my friends and family, I write nice reviews on Yelp.   In this case, several co-workers wanted to know where I got my sandwich from, and I lied.   Sorry, guys. Attitude matters.

Disclaimer: I do not party. I do not club. I no longer frequent establishments with the intent to get drunk and kiss men many years my senior. Those days are long gone, and this review reflects a chaste,  Labor Day lunch experience. No one peed their pants, or vomited $2 well drinks into the fountains outside. Be forewarned.   My boyfriend decided that he wanted to take me to Cabela's...not because I am a camper or outdoorsy girl, but because I have a love for all things elaborately themed. After traipsing through a delightful faux wilderness of guns and taxidermied animals, we were famished and ready to go just about anywhere to eat just about anything. We ventured across the street to Westgate, and McFadden's is where we happened to end up.  We walked in, and the place was just about empty. A courteous -  if a bit disconnected - hostess seated us at a table for two with big, comfy leather armchairs. Soon after, we ordered some nondescript beverages and surveyed the scene. Pretty classy interior for something set up like a sports bar/grill combo. No complaints about the atmosphere...lots of TVs, if that's your thing. "If that's your thing"...I use that phrase a lot in reviews. It's annoying. Sorry!  My boyfriend ordered the Pit Burger, and I ordered the Turkey Club. I can't speak for the millieu in the evenings, but we found the restaurant during the day to be very conducive to conversation, and enjoyed ourselves while we waited for our food. My Turkey Club was incredibly delicious...like, I want to eat another one. Right now. The fries were great...they are seasoned, but the menu doesn't tell you that. My boyfriend loved his burger, and the mashed potatoes he got to go with it...but I found them to be a little flavorless, and too buttery.   It's not a cool, hipster-points-hole-in-the-wall place, and nothing about it was special or gimmicky, but the food really was excellent for being something simple and unpretentious. Just regular lunch fare, at good prices and in a pleasing environment. The staff, as I mentioned before, was friendly enough, if a bit restrained. I wouldn't tell you to go out of your way to try it, and it really should be 3 stars, but that Turkey Club is still on my mind. Mmm.

Karey's Kitchen was my very first Yelp bookmark. Isn't that sweet? There was a big lull in my afternoon yesterday, a lull in which I had not eaten lunch, and yet, it was still much too early for dinner. I decided that this was the perfect time to head over to 40th St. and Thomas, and knock one more bookmark off of my ever-expaning panoply.   Karey's Kitchen is located on the southeast corner of 40th St. and Thomas, somewhat hidden behind a rogue Blockuster. There are many other businesses occupying its strip mall, but when I rolled up at about 3:30 in the afternoon, the entire parking lot was empty. Like, the whole thing. Mine was the single, solitary vehicle present. I'm sure it's a hub of activity at other times of the day, but apparently the middle of the afternoon renders the street corner a veritable ghost town.   The restaurant is small, and cute inside. It's clean and cheery, without being bright and antiseptic. I was greeted by a friendly lady who offered me several delicious samples, because it was my first time visiting! Is there any better introduction?   Another very friendly gentleman joined her, and asked me how I came to hear about Karey's Kitchen. I told him that I read about it on the internet, and he said, "OH! On Yelp?!" I like it when Yelp comes up in my daily life. It's fun. They were both very kind to me, and very interested in explaining the dishes to me.   Ultimately, I ordered a three item combo with garlic fried rice. Chicken Adobo, Beef Calidereta, and the Chicken Coconut Curry. I also snagged a square of Cassava cake.   A brief disclaimer: I do not have a sophisticated palate. I like my meals to have flavor. A LOT of flavor. Subtleties are generally wasted on me.  Delicious. Everything was absolutely delicious. The Chicken Adobo was definitely my favorite, but the other two were very, very good...things I would certainly order again. Every item was totally bursting with flavor, and I was in a food coma before I even finished eating. Scrumptious and savory. The Cassava cake was a perfect ending to the meal - it has an enjoyable, thick texture, and is not too sweet.   I loved everything that I ate, and can't wait to scurry back next week and try something new. Maybe the Lumpia...but definitely with a Chicken Adobo burrito and garlic rice. Yes. Sir.  Ps: The guy working there told me they will soon be offering Adobo sandwiches...apparently, people ask for them a lot. You heard it here first!

I adopted one of my cats from here, and would adopt every cat in the place if it could be guaranteed that they would be as lovely, mischievous, cute, and just plain full of kittenish delight as my Pellinore.   I actually adopted him from one of HALO's partnering PetSmart adoption...zones? But he came all microchipped, neutered and vaccinated from HALO, and it is to them that I must give the credit.   Their adoption fees are higher than the fees at the Arizona Humane Society, but HALO is a no-kill organization.   Definitely check out their website, and definitely adopt some cute cats. Or dogs, maybe. If you like them. Maybe you could also call my boyfriend and let him know that I should be allowed to adopt at least 3 more cats. Thanks in advance.
