As a frequent subway-go-er, this has been the worst subway i've ever gone to. Normally I feel bad about negatively reviewing a place, but after experiencing negative customer service more than 5 times at that location, i'd say it's safe to let it all out. While this place is conveniently close to my work, I am finding myself avoiding it every day during lunch time. Why? the employees frequently pick on me for the specific instructions I have on my sandwich. It seems as though asking for a little avocado is being noted as "picky". I am constantly picked on each time I go in there with constant "oh im sorry did you want cheese on this side or that?", "girlfriend make up your mind!", and "laughs" because I didn't want that extra high caloried 3rd cookie because it's 3 for a dollar (yes i like 2 and only 2 for the sake of not indulging myself...I think thats quite enough for my dollar thank you). As a customer, you're always supposed to walk out with a smile and experience a positive environment. Do I experience any of those? absolutely not, I find myself constantly muttering a bunch of rants each time I walk out in frustration that I as a customer am being picked on!! Perhaps that's their sense of humor, but they should realize that customer service is not a comedy show, and I don't have time for their silly remarks. Additionally, their "welcome to subway" is not welcome at all, especially when you don't even look at the customer while saying it. They're better off just not saying it all if it is not sincere. I will spend the extra dollar and mile to go to chipotle, thanks.

I love this place!! The food is 5 stars it's best and it's not even a fancy restaurant. I love the cheap drinks, atmosphere, staff and the fact that you get to watch them prepare your food in front of you

I LOVEEE this bar & grill. Me and my boyfriend at the time were huge regulars there for the past 2 years, although from time to time I enjoy coming back. The bartenders are all amazing, fast paced and on top of their game. They make great food suggestions and their tap selection is good.   You couldn't ask for a better restaurant that caters to everyone's needs. if you want the divey bar feel, they have a great bar set up with new TV's stationed, Megatouch play, pool and darts, and a race horse gambling area. If you're looking just to dine with a candlelit dinner, they have a quiet section in the restaurant and around the bar as well.

Your review helps others learn about great local businesses. With my experience at Target, it has been just okay. Compared to other targets, I find that this location could improve on their cleanliness, and customer service. Today, I had been agitated that all the shoes were completely unorganized, scrambled and messed with, while no associate was there to organize the stock which made it harder for me to find what I was looking for, especially with shoes thrown on the floor in addition to that. Also, as I was waiting in line at Starbucks in a rush, I find it a little frustrating that nearly 10 employees were in the way of waiting for my drink, talking about their personal life. Whether or not they were on break, they should also be considerate of actual customers having somewhere to go and an agenda to attend to while they have the store to themselves for the day. Also, it does not look good for the store or company at that. I even had to say "excuse me" in a loud and uncomfortable tone because an associate did not hear me while he was standing right in front of the sugar and cream section for no reason other than he needed somewhere to stand by. Why they all decided to hoard by at a place that people need to get through, is beyond me. There were plenty of tables and rest areas they could have sat in. Instead, they caused an inconvenience for a shopper.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.

I've been in once or twice before and there was not much to the bar. Then when I recently went in this past week,  I was so impressed with all the add ins to the bar such as the clean renovated bathrooms, jukebox, pool table, speakers, flat screen TVs and etc. The bartender was super nice and provided excellent customer service. We will definitely be returning back.

Store is clean, greeters are always nice and pleasant, but when it comes to the dressing room, it's terrible! It's always as if I have to beg to try on clothes. The attendant is almost never there, and when they are, they're in the corner not paying attention to customers walking in and out. Rep had her phone bulging in her back pocket, which is tacky in my opinion. There were about 5 people working out on the floor and one on the register. So while I had to witness one representative ring up all these guys clothes and then spend 10 minutes taking off the security tags I just dropped my clothes and walked away.

I am giving 4 stars, because for as huge as a company Nordstrom is, a majority of the time I receive exceptional service from staff and the company itself. Their store is well kept, clean, and organized, their staff is very welcoming, helpful and nice, and I love my Nordstrom card, benefits and the excellent return policy.  HOWEVER  It appears one staff member in the shoe department seems to think otherwise. On black Friday, I had received an incredibly rude, disrespectful, and inconsiderate attitude from "Hector S.". I had returned a pair of Tory Burch Sandals, and while Hector did not even initiate a single smile, hello, how are you and could not fathom even the minimal amount of friendly interaction as a representative, I didn't take it personally. In fact I ASKED HIM how his day was. He replied that he could not wait to go home. Okay then. What I did take personally, was him dramatically picking up and tossing the box next to his coworker basically laughing and mocking me for returning a pair of sandals. Did I have my back turned? was I looking at the shoe racks as he had done that from a distance? Nope! I didn't even leave the register. This all happened in front of me as if I didn't exist. I was so shocked, I immediately walked away and talked to a manager about it.   The manager I spoke with was very empathetic, understanding and talked about the whole thing with me. She was shocked herself as he had just been promoted to assistant manager. I felt so utterly disgusted that someone who had just been promoted at a high end store, would act so tasteless and unprofessional directly in front of a valued customer. I of course, escalated the situation but was disappointed at the outcome. I paid for valet that day, and expressed that I was in and out of the store in 5 minutes because of what happened and felt that the valet was a waste so I was hoping to get a valet credit or something to make up for the terrible experience I've had that day.   While I still continue to shop at Nordstrom and used to regularly go to the Scottsdale location on an every other day basis, I honestly am disappointed to say that I have not returned to that location since that day.  I love Nordstrom, but I think it's important to express the importance of customer service and experience. Also, as you can see in previous reviews, this appears to have been a trend in the shoe dept ALSO with a similar situation where a customer returned a pair of tory burch shoes and was assisted by a very disgruntled employee. I ask myself why I have avoided going back, and now I remember. PLEASE BEWARE of this person as you're shopping at Nordstrom.   As a valued customer, I'm disappointed that Scottsdale Fashion Nordstrom allows room for such nasty unprofessional behavior.

I have dined in here a few times, and taken an order to go. While the service is average, the food isn't that great and it is incredibly overpriced. I have tried various things in the menu and I wasn't crazy about the food. I think the only thing that is good on there would be the chips,salsa, and guacamole.

I've been to autumn court a few times, and officially hooked! Their happy hour specials are an incredible/easy deal to take advantage of, they have a nice clean restaurant with a fine ambiance. Their soundtrack is really nice, and they have a nice/fun waitstaff! Arvand is a fantastic bartender, and I would definitely recommend coming in!

I went in for brunch this morning with my mom, and forgetting that every place would be slammed on a Saturday, we were having trouble finding a place that would not have a long wait. Fortunately, we went to this place last minute after calling ahead to ask for hold times to which I was replied with "no wait time".  We went in, and only had to wait for less than a minute for us to get a table in a full house. Our server, Ti, was EXCELLENT. She was very attentive, kind, and was super helpful when my mom accidentally spilled some ketchup on herself. We were very impressed with her service, that we gave her a handcrafted coap from our business that we run as a thank you.  I had the strawberry pancakes with over medium eggs and hashbrowns. She had the blueberry oatmeal with a side of eggs. It was so delicious, and It didn't make me feel super full and bloated that starched pancakes normally would. It's a huge benefit that they make whole wheat pancakes, with decent servings.   I like that they have the coffee pot and water pitcher readily available for you at the table. It takes pressure off the server and customer for when they want refills and how much of a serving they want.   The place was well lit, clean and the bathrooms were very clean too.   Overall, I had a great experience and would come back again!

I am OBSESSED with this theater, as it is an escape from reality to curl up in reclined leather bound seats, comfort food, and drinks all while watching a new movie on the big screen. Additionally, as a brand new staff has been well trained and just as excited about the theater itself, the customer service is very welcoming and kind. If you're not on a tight budget, and love movies, drinks, and food as much as I do, this is the place for you!! :)

Writing an updated review about 4 years since the theatre opened (felt like yesterday!)  Unfortunately, it has gone a little downhill IMHO in regards to how staff is managed, the new menu items and how they're prepped.   Food/Drink  They actually had great menu items in the past with the beer battered chicken tenders/fish sticks and parmasean fries which now have a different texture/taste in the way they're prepped. Or perhaps they are doing business with a different food vendor. Either way, it's not as good as it used to be. I haven't gotten the chance to try their new burgers, but i'll be back another time to try it eventually.   Their beers and cocktail choices have remained the same I believe. I mean, it's drinks. The taste of vodka, tequila, sam adams and what not are always going to be there. Of course, all objective if the tap co2 remains consistent! But great beer selections either way. I also like the 16-20 oz options too.   Service:  It's average. Ultimately, all I care about is that you're efficient in when you respond to the button (unless its a busy weekend, i understand) and if you get me the right items. I don't need you to give me WOW! but just prompt timely service. Unfortunately, even during the weeknights i'm there, that is not always the case. 10-15 minutes for a bar napkin ? cmon!  But the whole coming in during previews or the movie doesn't bug me. What i don't understand about some of these reviews, is that people forget they're in a DINE IN THEATRE. you want snacks and drinks before the movie? go to a gas station or harkins! you don't want to be interrupted during a movie? well what the heck are you doing in the dine in theatre to begin with? that's what the concept is about. Yes, it's not always ideal to hear side conversations during the movie, but thats the sacrifice, and even then it's still worth it.  Prices:  Okay yes, it is a lot of money upfront. But it's for the luxury and convenience of being served at a movie theatre WITH reclining chairs WHILE watching a movie and being able to drink alcohol in the theatre at that. So, the prices are pretty reasonable for the experience. Plus, if you were to go to dinner prior to seeing a movie, you're still dropping a good chunk of money for the evening anyway.   Location:  It's in the heart of biltmore, with a beautiful view of the mountain when you walk out during the day or early evening. Plus, while you do wait for your movie to start, you have the luxury of hanging out by their bar or the biltmore fashion park for drinks/apps if ur not getting any of that in the theatre.   I never really have a bad experience in this movie theatre, and I will be returning back again.

Fun and outgoing dive bar. I thank the guy with the pretzel picture, because it enticed me to order their food for the first time last night. It was delicious!  Good tap selection, decent prices, great menu, and the environment is fun between the patrons you interact with and the games to play with your crowd. The plus is that they serve food until they close at 2 am. HUGE plus.   The only thing I would suggest is friendlier service. The bartenders and servers never look happy to be there.

To further add on to my previous review, I ran into a situation that proves that the servers/bartenders really need to step up their game in the attitude department. I understand that you come across multiple annoyances servicing customers, but it is never okay to take your anger out on them because you hate your job. A server, Shelly, seemed really irked that I asked for a pickle for my hot dog and fries basket after I told her that's what I wanted initially. I didn't get a pickle, fine, mistakes happen. I politely ask for one to which she doesn't acknowledge me but just glares and talks to another customer to which she goes to the back and gets me a pickle and says "you're welcooooooome" before I even had a chance to say thank you. Perhaps you think immature childish behavior and remarks is cute, but you're a grown woman representing the business and the bar and you're making yourself look bad and unprofessional. Plus the hot dog and fries were disgusting, dry and cold. When you scroll through previous reviews on this establishment, you'll see that this clearly is a trend. I refuse to go back to that bar. Please go to dilly's across the street. The bartenders  there really make it a point to make you feel welcome! newly renovated PLUS cheap drinks. You're also next to a sports bar and grill that serves great food!

They say "dress for the job you want, not for the job you have". I feel as though that is what bartender Derrick does, but with his sparking personality! For a local small dive bar, Derrick brings exceptional, classy and professional service. He is very kind, welcoming, and very engaging! I'll be coming back more often for sure!

Friendly staff, EXTREMELY slow service. Every time I have come here, I come back to work late from my lunch break. This evening, I asked the barista if my order is being made, and she got very defensive and made excuses that there are "big orders that they need to make, we have drive through service, etc". If having a drive through means taking up more time to make quick orders, I would rather not inconvenience you with my order and I will refrain from coming back.

I rarely ever visit this location unless I am in a desperate need of good coffee in between my breaks at work, and every single time i visit, i remember why. I really cannot understand after countless trending reviews of the same complaint, how management has not shaped up this location together. The drive-through times are awful! and each time, they aren't busy! I actually have literally waited an extra 6 minutes at the window (i'm not kidding) watching employees just do some bored side work, and i'm wondering if my coffee is even going to be made. Little did i know, it was sitting there the entire time, but the drive-thru employee was temporarily MIA. I don't know if she took a bathroom break and had no one attend to the window to cover, or if they're not organized enough to staff certain employees to do different tasks. Either way, the drive-thru setting is not an excuse for the wait times (i've heard this excuse before). Multiple starbucks drive-thru's are very prompt. This location has no idea what they're doing!! After two times of making me late back to work, never again!

I have been a frequent goer to this restaurant while living in the city and while the food and drinks are great, the service is absolutely terrible. I have never met such an overly arrogant and prideful staff. They feel that as long as you have a minor issue, it is your fault and not theirs. For example, my friend specifically asked for the midnight martinis, it is 12:02 PM. She serves us full sized martinis. My friend was a little concerned that the waitress didn't hear us correctly, and to make sure we were not being charged full priced, she flagged the waitress over to which she says "those are full priced martinis." My friend proceeds to state that we have specifically requested midnight martinis to which the waitress responds "I didn't hear you.". So instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering the midnight specials, she retaliates and gets defensive. Because of her incompetence, we request to speak to the manager to which he towers over the table and asks "What's going on here?". oh hi, nice to see you too. He didn't even introduce himself properly nor professionally. I was so turned off by the negative and defensive attitude, that I have just about had it with that place. IT is not the first time I have received this poor service, and they need to get off their high horse and get their game together. Sorry i'm not sorry Hanny's, but we're going to have to part ways.  What is a huge turn off of all, is knowing that after scrolling through these reviews, 1 out 5 customers are very unhappy with the service provided and almost all have the same context, "servers and waitstaff are rude".   I am pleading out to the owner of Hanny's: For the sake of you're great restaurant, please hire new management and waitstaff, they are making you look horrible!!!

Yay! I found a subway by work that's not full of mopy, unprofessional sandwich artists!   I wrote a review earlier regarding a particular subway location that I can't stand walking foot in. Now I drive the extra mile to 555 N. 7th Street and don't regret it one bit. I was welcomed with a bright smile and sincerity and was helped immediately with absolutely great customer service. It is worth the extra mile to pick up some of your favorite food at this location. I highly recommend for anyone in the area!! :)

I like going here and try to go here often as they do also offer a punch card for every time you get your nails done by them.  One complaint I have is for a nail tech that was standing beside the cashier waiting to hear what she would be tipped.  At that time, I was splitting payments on each card and therefore was including tip with both cards as well. So of the total services that I had, I was going to give a $10 tip which I was doing 3 on one card and 7 on the other card on top of the mani/pedi charges. When I said put 3 on one card, the technician who was standing there, let out a chuckle feeling insulted but yet not realizing i was actually giving her the full 10 when i was done with the transactions. When she realized what I was actually doing in the end, she let out a big thank you and a smile. While I understand the frustrations behind not being tipped well ,its best not to judge the situation, especially when the transaction had not even been completed yet.  It is completely unprofessional and I actually felt somewhat humiliated being assumed that I am a cheap tipper. Because I felt so turned off from that situation, I have actually decided to take a break for a while.   Other than that, I enjoy the services, the technicians do a great job with the nails, but I choose not to give my business for a while after being insulted from that one tech.

I give 5 stars because despite the minor mistakes (like hold time, having a drink spilled, and waiting 30-45 mins to be waited on) I know that nothing is perfect and I don't sweat the small stuff. Why? Because I enjoy great comedy. I don't take life too seriously and I love seeing independent comics sharing their 15 minutes of what they value the most out of their life to share with the audience. Those are the things I appreciate and absolutely live for. Thank you Howard Hughes, Jason Collings, Frank Zapata and the rest of the comics for a great show. I'll definitely be returning back!

I love O.H.S.O ! nothing but good experiences here. The beers are great, food is kind of pricey, but I have had the pretzels, calamari and steak appetizers which were delicious. I brought two of my dogs here and it's such a perfect environment for a beer and dog lover. They also provide dog water bowls and home made dog treats. who could ask for more?

I've done my research, had my awful experience and found that I am unfortunately not the first customer nor the last to experience in an incredibly awful wait time. This is fast food, and there is no, NO excuse for a 25 minute wait time in the DRIVE-THRU. Before I could even say anything, the employee said "sorry for the wait! had to wait for fresh food". If your fast food restaurant takes nearly half an hour to make fresh food for your customers, than I'll just go to a sit down place instead.The food is good, but not worth waiting that long for.

I signed up for my membership in the Arcadia location, which is the gym nearest to me. Thankfully for my black card membership, I am able to utilize their services in any location. During my staycation in Chandler while my apartment was undergoing maintanence, I had the convenience of using their gym here in Chandler which was great.   As far as services you can use in this Gym, take this review from someone who had gone from $200 + a month for Lifetime Fitness, Boot Camp Fitness Classes, Palates and Barre memberships, and tried other various similar basic gyms like LA Fitness, Independence Gym and etc. I have done it all. And nothing satisfies my needs more than Planet Fitness does. Now I completely get that it is not for everyone, it is as simple as it gets. Easy, judgment free, no "lunking", and other perks such as tanning, massage and discounts to a few merchants.   The reason why it benefits me so well is that I am very simple with my workout plan such as cardio, legs, arms, etc to which they have the most easy and user friendly machines that benefit an all over body work out. In addition to that, without the 24 hour availability, i would have never been able to sign up for a membership as I have a unique work schedule. I understand many have more particular work out needs and therefore would benefit from other gyms along with the sauna, pool , fitness classes, etc. I wish I had more time and schedule availability for all of that!!  Overall, I couldn't have asked for more with Planet Fitness. When I was first introduced with the gym, I had went with my sister as a guest, and they never hassled me or pressured me into signing up for any memberships as other gyms did which felt borderline harassing. I was also not pressured when i first came into the Arcadia location, and had no intention of even signing up when all I wanted to do was workout in a gym for a night when my apartment gym was falling apart, but because of the positive environment, great customer service and healthy atmosphere, I could not turn the opportunity down.  I swear by planet fitness now, and cannot wait to go to the gym tonight!

Hayla welcomed me with open arms as I came in last minute to drop off a pair of jeans that needed minor stitching. She was very flexible and told me to simply just call her when i'm on my way to pick it up, as I did. The pricing is definitely very affordable and reasonable. I also discovered she has a beautiful custom made line of handbags (I am the ultimate handbag queen, so I appreciate these things!) that I would recommend potential or existing clients take a look at. I will be back for sure!!

I came in here last night for the first time for a couple beers and apps and was impressed with the concept.  Atmosphere:   They have three different seating areas depending on your mood. They have a "tasting room" ideal if you want to try the different types of beers they have shown on tap with a few of their actual brewing tanks/brewing room.   They have a patio with picnic style tables if you're up for dining/drinking in the fresh air  Then they have of course, indoor seating where they will play live/loud music and a divey bar atmosphere.   Drink:  We picked the tasting room, where I tried the Refuge IPA, The Dakofa Ale, and their lightest beer which slightly tasted of the dakofa but eliminating the belgian bite after your sip. It's the perfect brew and I would definitely recommend it to all beer enthusiasts/drinkers.  Food: We tried the spinach artichoke dip with homemade corn chips which was pretty tasty for bar food, along with the pretzel sticks and beer cheese. I really liked the beer cheese, but the pretzels could have been better. It was slightly on the bland/dry side, but overall it was okay.   Their menu items are really unique, if you come across it online, you'll know what I am talking about.   I live in Scottsdale, but made about a 30 min drive to get to here, which didn't feel very far. I hear that they're opening up a smaller location in downtown gilbert, but I hope someday they will expand to scottsdale/phoenix!

I have been to The Henry a couple of times, and dined last night.   My server, Matthew, was very engaging, attentive and suggested the featured appetizer off the menu which was the Tuna Tartare. It was excellent and I was happy with the suggestion.  There are selective choices on the menu, but I would definitely recommend trying various appetizers vs. one entree to get a better taste of what the restaurant has to offer.   They make sure that your dining experience is pleasant and that your accomodations are met which I really like.

I have never felt so insulted and put down by a business establishment ever until I came into this place. Had I been smart enough to read reviews before walking in, I would have never purchased this groupon, but I was in a rush and wanted to find a good deal, silly me.   I walk in looking forward to this mani pedi knowing that I was having a good day, it was my day off and thought I was going to be relaxed and pampered. Instead, I had been given "service" from what I thought was a fun and cheerful person, only to find that she is the most negative, miserable and condescending person I have ever met. And I made the mistake of conversating with her as she asked me basic questions like "where are you from?" "What do you do?"   By answering them, I was followed by with "scottsdale? Ugh that place is full of snobs. Are you one of them? I bet you you'll turn into one within a year watch. Or a golddigger."  I say "uhhh....no. I'd like to think I'm a nice person"   She goes "just you wait" excuse me ????  Then when I say what I am going to school for, she goes "how do people pick careers like that?"   When she then found the little bruises behind my toes nails which I had no idea about until the nail polish came off, she asked how I got those and I told her I'm a frequent runner so that could be it. She says "what is the point of running if it hurts your feet?" (It doesn't actually, but your opinions are pretty unsolicited at this point !!! Stop talking !)   She then goes on to other customers that were waiting about how her husband booked them a trip to Mexico which she was unimpressed with because "what is there to do over there?" (And you call me a snob!?)  She consistently talked crap about her husband, insulted me multiple times, and bad mouthed these people she was supposed to have sold her husbands car to that stopped by the salon.   She then asked me THREE TIMES "why don't you like funky colors? Are you depressed?" So if I chose a neutral color of all the times I pick pink, blue or red all of a sudden I'm depressed ? Is this chick for real?  In between the insults, bad mouthing and negative unprofessional attitude, she also managed to reiterate how she could not wait to get out of there while rushing through my crap job of a manicure and pedicure. It's interesting she mentioned that considering that she gave me a specific time to come in for an appointment (I didn't even ask to come in at the time scheduled).  I was so appalled, disgusted and turned off by how distasteful, unprofessional, insulting and rude she was the ENTIRE time. Not once, not twice, the entire experience was miserable and I couldn't get out of there fast enough.   I'm sure she saw how bummed I was throughout it all, because she "suddenly" changed her attitude at how happy she probably was that she made someone as miserable as she. It was disgusting.   I never not tip anyone, and I had no hesitation to leave without tipping a damn penny. I highly discourage ANYONE from visiting this place. I  completely understand what it's like to have a bad day at work and not be as "cheerful" or normal as you would be, but this person made it a point to go out of her way to ruin someone's day and I hate to say it was mine. And I normally brush things off quickly, but I am so upset that I even spent a dollar at this place.  I encourage everyone to read reviews before doing business with an establishment! Calling groupon tomorrow, I seriously felt that insulted that I want my money back .   Also, if you check out the other reviews, she has a bad reputation of insulting other people, talking about her problems and maintaining an unprofessional image. Perhaps that's why she may feel that putting up a sign insisting on tipping may bring her more money. How about you work on being more professional and pleasant ! Did you ever think that changing your attitude and mannerisms would motivate more tips !?  UPDATE: I got my money back and I feel much better knowing that despite being put in a vulnerable situation, she in return got no profit.

The outside reminded me of Mimi's cafe and automatically assumed that the food was going to be mediocre, but I should always remember to not judge a book by it's cover as cliche as it sounds.  Anyway, it was my birthday and my parents wanted to treat me for a nice lunch to which we all decided after looking online at what cheddar's was all about, to try it out.  When we got there, the inside looked amazing, a bit upscale and the menu selection looked inviting and I was happy about the combination choices as well, given that I am that person that needs to try everything.   We ordered the stack of onion rings as an appetizer which was delicious. I also ordered strawberry lemonade which was really good, a bit on the sweet side though. For an entree, I had a half rack of ribs/fried shrimp combo with fries and a side of mac and cheese which was amazing.   I would definitely come back for more!

I have been here a few times. The girls i've done business with were friendly, but I do agree that based on the reviews on here, getting a simple "hello" would have been beneficial for the business standpoint.  In addition to that, this is a great store/location as a buyer to find somewhat good quality clothes/trendy brands for a very affordable rate compared to most consignment stores. As a seller, I would say look the other way and try other consignment stores or apps. (ebay, poshmark, etc).   I found that they're not very consistent in taking your items at all, and if you ask why they wouldn't take your items, they throw in the same "it's out of season/more of a mature brand" excuse which is starting to get old. Sorry, but there are a lot of young clientel buying Michael Kors, Rebecca Minkoff, which are yes, mature brands. Believe it or not, a lot of designer brands carry more of a mature fan base than teenagers, which is what they're basically most inspired by in the fashion industry. My friend bought a michael kors wristlet from there for $20, and when I tried selling the same exact wristlet that I had but in a different color, they did not take it. Also, there are times where you will come across multiple Rebecca Minkoff items sold for over $60 (which is a steal) and when I tried bringing in my Mini Mac, they were selling it for $35!!!!!! the same exact price as an out of season older minkoff wallet they had in stock. I thought it was a joke and a huge slap in the face. That was when I was told "well, it has some wear and tear and it's a mature brand so it's not sold easily". My bag  had very minor wear on the bottom corners of the bag, and even then, I have seen completely worn out and used minkoff bags sold for more than $50. Meanwhile they have kate spade, tory burch, michael kors and everything rebecca minkoff in sight. At that point, I was reminded as to why I steer clear from that place.  To recap, good and affordable for a buyer, but a total insult as a consigner. Pass.

As much of a runner and "gym goer" as I am, I did not think that a gym membership would ever benefit me, considering that I had a gym at my complex I could easily use for free. Unfortunately, I had come across countless problems with the gym within the past year of my residence. And it wasn't until this evening that I had a wakeup call that things were just not going right for me. From my stressful day at work, to finding no machines working at my apt Gym, I was ready to give up. While I was close to just being a couch potato and binging on netflix for mental stimulation, I was so determined to use my energy to something that would be healthy and useful for me, so I went to the nearest 24 hour gym I could think of.   When I walk in, I was impressed with how clean and lively it was at this time of night (approximately 11:15 pm) and waited aside from the people who were members scanning themselves in. While i anticipated being berated with rushy membership selling tactics, I was told to simply sign in the guest sheet and welcomed with open arms. I was very impressed and already felt apart of the gym. I had briefly told the attendant about my night, especially about how sad I was that i left my earbuds at home, so thanks to planet fitness, they sell affordable earbuds at only $10.00. I was in on my workout in less than 2 minutes of walking in and I was so incredibly relieved and happy that my night ended up working out (no pun intended) with the run I've been yearning to take after taking a few weeks off.   While I have had experience being a member in other gyms, even the most expensive, I found this to be the most relatable in a way where they're definitely known for the "non judgement" environment. The people that were around me seemed very friendly, down to earth, and just your average fitness goers completing a decent healthy workout without any obnoxious "having to make a point" personalities. The environment made me feel so comfortable and at ease. I loved it all. In addition to that, I love the organization of the machines and the sections of the gym. Totally helpful. I also liked that the gym wasn't freezing cold like a ton of gyms are. I'd like to think that the air is comfortable enough to work out in, and not so cold that you can't even break out in a sweat.  When I completed my workout, I went up to the attendant to let him know that I was interested in gym rates and potentially a membership. No hassle, No Pressure, and the membership is SO affordable. I ended up signing up with the black card, because why not? 10 bucks more and you get additional perks that would essentially benefit me as a member.   I love when things are quick and easy with no fuss or fluff, and that is what Planet Fitness appears to be. I am so happy to have joined and in addition to that, found that there was a reason behind my stressful evening. I finally found the gym that serves me best as a member.  Thanks Planet Fitness!

I tried this salon for the first time a few months ago, and absolutely adored it.  It's clean, organized, and a super cute shop ran by two women that are so friendly and maintain a very professional image.  They make a point to make every customer feel welcome, as they introduced every one of us to each other as the services were being provided.   The mani pedi I got was fantastic and looked amazing. In addition to that, they referred me to a waxer that is not only affordable, but did her job well. She also works in the salon and has her own room.   I totally recommend this to everyone!

have been going to Massage Envy for years, and this is so conveniently close from my apartment so I always walk out happy, but my last masseuse, Imelda, took care of me very well. I work at a sit down job for 10 hours and I am also a runner, so  my body is getting much more sensitive. She recommend more work on the bottom area of my back and my glutes which I agree, do need a ton of work on despite how sensitive it is.
