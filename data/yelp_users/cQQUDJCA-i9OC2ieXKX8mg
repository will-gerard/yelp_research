When we moved to Arizona, Carlsbad Tavern was one of the very first places we tried. And I have never returned. I drive by it from time to time and just wonder how it stays open. As other Yelpers have mentioned: they charge for chips and salsa, and neither are even remarkable (DON'T buy it). I thought the atmosphere was okay and welcoming for a casual place.   Perhaps it was an off day, but the food and the service were quite poor. We went in for lunch on a Friday, and I had chicken quesadillas because I wasn't too hungry. My date ordered a green chili burrito. The only thing that saves this from being a one star in my mind was that the green chili was really tasty on the burrito.   I would recommend trying something else in the valley before trying here.

Two words: Celebration Champagne.  Start with that and go from there to enjoy a fun night out in Old Town. This place is always hopping with locals who know where to find this hidden hot spot.   The prices for food are really reasonable, and the portions sizes are generous. I would sell my favorite pair of jeans for one of their grilled cheese sandwiches. The waffle fries are also delicious, as are salads, desserts, and the other sandwiches.   I love the rotating art showcased, the sexy bathrooms, and the unique music at AZ88. When the weather is pleasant, sit outside and enjoy views of park and soft breezes.   One complaint might be that it can get loud, but that's because people are drinking celebration champagne (or beers, wines, or just plain water). AZ88 is fun with fantastic food. Go on, celebrate.

This is my absolute favorite Thai place in the Phoenix area; I just cannot get enough of Thai Elephant. The red curry is like heaven in a bowl! It has affordable prices and great selections. I like that you can have a quick meal if you are in a hurry and not shell out a ton a of money. Lunch there is amazing, as it includes soup and a spring roll. In Tempe and surrounding areas, this is the only way to eat Thai!

I thoroughly enjoyed my time this week with Ethereal Nails. I had the opportunity to meet the business owners and technicians named Elizabeth and Maria, who are incredibly smart, talented, funny, and beautiful sisters. I adored the set up of the studio, the more intimate vibe than many salons, and the unique color choices they offered. Maria did an amazing job with painting my toes and doing a sea salt buffing procedure that helped my dry climate-impacted stems. Elizabeth's manicure was lovely, especially the hand/arm massage portion, and she is a great conversationalist. I would recommend that for manicures they get closure to the cuticles with the polish, as I could see a small line around my cuticles that wasn't quite as far down as I prefer my polish to look after I left. I will be back when I am in town to chat more and get my relaxation and style on!
