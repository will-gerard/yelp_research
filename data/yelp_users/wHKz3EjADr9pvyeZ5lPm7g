OK - I'll be honest... I LOVE their food (especially the sushi).  But their service can be REALLY bad.  I've had to re-order drinks multiple times, wait long times for a check at the table...  and most recently I tried to place a pick up order over the phone.    I asked to pick up my food in 1 hour, they asked why I was calling so far in advance... I explained that I was going to be in a meeting and couldn't call back in 30 minutes to place the order.  Their response was that they would have it ready in 20 minutes, but I didn't want my sushi sitting for another 40 minutes before I picked it up.  They said they couldn't guarantee to have it ready in an hour.  SERIOUSLY?  You're kidding, right?  So, I hung up and won't be doing that again.  I also cancelled my plans with a group of 14 friends to have dinner there this weekend... we're going to Stingray instead.    I've lost my patience with Moto.  Yea, the food is good - but the service is just so ridiculously bad...

I lived within walking distance of Postino for 5 years - and it is still one of my favorite Arcadia neighborhood spots.  The wine list is always changing and is really well picked.  Their bruschetta boards are fantastic - I especially recommend the pistachio/date or the Prosciutto/fig.  Their salted caramel desert sunday is totally worth leaving room for!  This is a great place for a get together with friends or an intimate date night.  The service is always great and everyone who works there really knows their wine - so you can get advice from your server on which wines will meet your tastes each month when the new list comes out.  Brent's Picks are always a safe way to choose your wine also!  Love Love Love Postino!

I have been going to Dr House for over 5 years and absolutely love her and her office staff.  All my friends and family now go to Dr House also and everyone raves about her.  She is professional, thorough and gentle.  We are very happy patients! Note: her office moved to 32nd & Camelback...  make sure not to go to the old office on 44th Street.

This is my absolute favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix.  We go here for our birthdays, anniversaries, etc... any special occasion is a reason to go to Marcellino (or just no occasion other than date night)!  What do we love?  The fresh pasta presentation at the beginning of the meal is so fun.  The food is always exceptionally tasty.  The ambiance is lovely.  The owner and his wife walk around the restaurant to ensure that everyone is enjoying their meal - and everyone always looks very happy.  The have live music on most nights as well which makes the entire space feel very intimate.  They also have this great private booth you can reserve for special occasions.    I can't say enough good things about Marcellino.  It's our "GO TO" place in Phoenix.

Ugh.  I really dislike this store.  The service is slow and they are always understaffed.  Nobody could help me this morning and i was looking for assistance.  Then i finally get what i think i need and i head to check out.  they had some woman right in front of me returning about 30-35 small sprinkler items and as the checkout line is backing up because the return is taking FOREVER... the other staff are not helping.  They open another checkout and help everyone behind me... so I eventually have to leave because after standing at checkout for 13 minutes, I'm running late.  So I leave my stuff and say I can't wait any longer.  Absurd!!!  They flushed my $$ away and I won't go back.

Love this store.  It's always clean and easy to navigate.  Prices are good.  Staff are awesome and their produce quality is excellent.  Some of the top items are their fish and meat.  They get high quality meat and fish for a reasonable price - including grass-fed beef...  which is hard to find.  What's not to love?

Nice lady at the door...  went in to buy a quick tablet. Just wanted to add one to my account. Waited for 10 minutes after I was told it would be a 5 minute wait..  saw that  there were still people ahead of me on the list, So I had to leave. Kind of a bummer that you can't just pop in and buy something. I wish they have a way you could just walk up buy your item and check out. Too bad they lost my business

One of our go-to places.  We eat here frequently and it's the best if you want consistently high service with outstanding food.  They get it right EVERY time.  I have probably been here 20 times and NEVER had to send something back.  Their Crab Cakes are INSANELY good (although seasonal.. so not always available).  Their prime rib is good, the chicken is great.  I also like their grilled artichoke appetizer.  It's amazing.  Awesome bartenders - so the drinks are perfect.  The staff work together SO cohesively - you would never know whether someone is covering your table or not, because EVERYONE offers to take care of whatever you need.  WE LOVE Houston's.

Love this place.  Bern meaning to check it out for a while and finally had dinner here this week.  Service was impeccable, wine list was decent, food was outstanding.  I had gluten free chicken andushrooms with pasta... it was perfect.  The other main dish we tried was pasta with seafood, also outstanding. Their coffee was delicious and Limoncello was also very good.  Can't wait to go back...  quiet, delicious, relaxing.  Just what we needed to find in our neighborhood.

We like Tutti Santi a lot.  It's in our neighborhood and we normally order for take-out.  Their food is really quite good.  We have tried a number of different entrees and everything has been really consistent quality.  Although I frequently see older children there (above 8 years old), I wouldn't recommend eating-in with small children because it's a bit of a quite and more intimate setting for small kids who could get restless.  But the food is great and they happily do take-out!

This is where I buy bialys when I need them (best ones in phx)...  and I pop in here sometimes to have lunch.  They have great sandwiches and salads.  Free wifi makes it an ideal place to work while I'm grabbing lunch too.  Their coffee is also pretty good...  with bottomless refills!    It's easy, quick and delicious.

Not good!  I used to eat here regularly but haven't been to Malees in a couple years.  It has REALLY gone downhill.  Bad food, terrible service and an overall disappointment.  :(. Not going back!

We are regulars here and the food is always consistently good, as is the service.  It's exactly what you expect from a neighborhood restaurant with a large bar, welcoming staff and high quality food.  I especially like that the kitchen is open and visible to the dining room.  Their ribs are outstanding, as is most of the fish I've tried.  I would give it 5 stars except that I've had times where I'm there late into the evening, and the staff start to get a little 'slack' and aren't responsive to getting your check, change, etc...  I know they're eager to go home, but they still need to finish up their tables and make sure customers have what they need.  Other than that - we love this place and will keep going back.

I know that everyone raves about Pizzeria Bianco...  so I waited my 2-hour wait to get a table with friends and try the pizza.  To be honest - NOT worth the wait.  The pizza was fine, nothing wrong with it at all - but not worth a 2 hour wait.  Everything about this place was "fine" in my book, but absolutely not exceptional or worth the long wait, loud space and slow order time for the pizza to arrive at the table.

Love Tommy Bahama's food.  I've never had a bad meal here.  The fish dishes are especially awesome and all of their appetizers are delicious and perfect for sharing.  They have an interesting drinks menu with a strong island theme - and their bartenders really make great drinks (including some fun non-alcoholic options like the mint and basil lemonade).    Their plantain chips (if you're a banana fan) should not be missed - they're a delicious side... as is their cauliflower.  My only complaint is that if they are busy - the service is slow and frequently it takes a long time for drink refills and anything you need with your meal (i.e. nobody 'checks' on you and how your meal is going once they take your initial order... they just get the food out to you).    Food rocks!

OMG - we love this place.  It's one of our favorite spots in Vegas.  The wine is SPECTACULAR - and ask the bartender to recommend wines for your meal - bartenders here are excellent sommeliers.  The food is more French authentic than I anticipated - and it's very good.  the salads are outstanding too.  Also - if you're Gluten Free... tell them.  They will bring you Gluten Free YUMMY bread and accommodate the menu for you!  LOVE LOVE LOVE Mon Ami Gabi!

We eat here regularly - it's definitely one of our 'go to' spots in the neighborhood.  The service and food are always consistent and the drinks are particularly good.  If you like a mule, their fig mule is really tasty and served in a copper cup - so it stays super cold until you finish it (as a mule should).  We consistently order the kale salad to start.  it's exceptional.  sometimes I just order it as a main course - it's that good.  For main dishes, we really like the trout and short ribs.  my husband loves their chicken pot pie... but it's BIG and you need to be hungry.  we rarely get dessert since their food is satisfying - but we did have gelato last time that was really great.  Overall... it's just always great.  patio is great seating and the bar is even nice if you're popping in and want a quick bite.

We go to Cibo to grab dinner whenever we are heading downtown for a show.  We really love this place.  It's likely that you will have a short wait for a table - and it's a tight space.  But it's worth the wait!  The food is consistently excellent and the service is pretty fast.  I absolutely love their pizza and their appetizers are also delicious.  If you plan on going in a group larger than 4, send someone early to put your name in to make sure you're not waiting too long!

I've been going to Maggiano in Chicago for years and it's always been consistently good.  This location doesn't live up to their reputation.  Service was slow and not helpful on recommendations.  Twice, they brought me a bottle of corked wine (after the first one, you would think that they would have checked it before bringing me another).  One of our meals was Eggplant Parm...  very good.  The country style pasts was ok, but nothing amazing. My meal was Gluten free pasta with clams and white sauce.  It was WAY too soupy, and the garlic was too raw.  Also, their gluten free pasta is TERRIBLE.  There is a lot of good GF pasta, they need a new one at Maggiano's.  Drinks were slow to refill, service was adequate but not attentive and  the review on the food at our table ranged from good to bad.  It's just not the Maggiano's in Chicago

One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale - Deseo never disappoints.  I especially LOVE their cheese bread - it's unbelievable.  I've eaten a ton of their main meals and frequently order the chef special of the night, which never disappoints.  I love sitting up at the bar near the kitchen and watching the chefs create the magnificent food.  This place is really great.  Consider date night here - it's intimate and romantic!

We love it here.  Food is amazing and the service is some of the best we've experienced.  Both times that we've been here the ambiance was enhanced with live music - which was great.  My only complaint is that it's a 'place to be seen' in the bar area - so it's tough to grab a drink and chat before dinner because it is SO crowded.  If you want a popular place to meet singles or go for a 'night out', hit the bar here.  We usually stick to the restaurant area and we love the food and service.  Just be prepared for the party crowd in the bar!

I started going here when I got  a Groupon for a massage.  I really liked the massage from Stephanie.   Her massage was great.  She did a really nice job - and I'm pretty picky about my massage therapists.  When I finished my massage, there was no "pressure" to buy a massage package, but I did anyway because it was such a great massage and very well priced if you buy a pack of 5.  My only (small) complaint is that because Stephanie is really good, her schedule fills up - so it takes about 6 weeks to get an appointment if you have any schedule preference.  Overall - good massage and good value.  I'm looking forward to my next massage in a few weeks!

Service is very friendly at Hobe and there's a nice variety of cuts of meat and even some more exotic meats (elk, bison, duck) in their freezer section.  Unfortunately, they don't do any organics or pasture fed meats... which is what I came looking for.  I did buy a variety of meats to try, all of which were pretty good...  if you're looking to buy from a local shop, they have good meat.  If you're looking for organic or pasture fed... this isn't your place.

Meh...  that's how I felt about it.  It's a standard local bar and below-average food.  Our kids had pizza which was soggy (although their french fries were good) and we had a taco salad that was small and not-so-good.  Service was perfectly fine and the prices were average.  I wouldn't rush back here for a meal, but for drinks and some game-watching, it's fine.

We are really happy with Desert Ridge Pediatric Dentistry.  We always see Dr Bienstock when we go in and she is absolutely fabulous.  My 3 year old not only enjoys the fun office, but also feels very attached to Dr Bienstock and trusts her.  She was able to help us break the "Binky" habit - which we had been struggling with.  We are definitely sold on this dentists office.  It's just a BONUS that they have done such an AMAZING job on decorating with the space ship theme.  It's really a cool place.  Our 1 year old will be going for his first appointment soon and I am confident that we will continue to feel good about the incredible attention that the kids receive when they go in!

I'm going to stick to a coffee review.  I've only ever had their baked goods and coffee (although the food looks spectacular).  I pop in here with my kids and grab a coffee ($0.50 for a refill) each weekend and buy the kids a muffin or cookie.  Their coffee is WONDERFUL.  I'm a coffee snob and even roast my own beans at home...  so when I give kudos for good coffee - I really mean it!  They have spectacular coffee.  My kids love their baked goods, and the fact that everyone there is SUPER friendly is the 5-star boost.

I have been going to Kandy at Snapdragon for YEARS and now all my friends and family go to her too because everyone I know is always so impressed.  She is, hands down, the best colorist in Phoenix!  What I really love is that when she cuts your hair, she does it when your hair is dry...  which gives is a much better look since she can shape your hair to look how it SHOULD look when your hair is dry and styled.  I've sent friends to some of Snapdragon's other stylists as well (like Damian and Nicole) and everyone I send becomes a loyal customer.   I even have a sister who drives in (3 hours) from out of town to get her hair done at Snapdragon!  If that isn't loyalty - I don't know what is!

I went with friends who have been before and love this place... I was unimpressed.  I tried the crab pot, pasta fries, dates, Mac/cheese and chicken n waffles.  It felt like the chef was trying to get too many flavors on each plate, regardless of whether or not they complimented each other.  Nothing excited me but the crab pot had some pickled watermelon accompaniment that was pretty good and interesting.

I've tried out almost all the resort spas in Phoenix - and this is definitely one of my top 3.  I've visited Joya about 5 times and had various massage and facial treatments.  I absolutely love this spa.  It's expensive - but worth it.  The facilities are beautiful and relaxing - not to mention impeccably clean at all times.  I love the 'waiting' room area before treatments and the roof-top pool with small dining area is absolutely perfect and private.  Their spa food menu is great (usually I think these are too 'skimpy' for a meal)...  and is both filling and healthy in the food choices.  The the therapists I've had have all been excellent.  This is now my 'go-to' spot for spas in town.  Even the front desk staff are incredibly warm and inviting.  Love the Montelucia spa!

We called Alan's plumbing when we lost water pressure in a part of our house.  We were concerned about a slab leak under our home.  They sent a manager, Pete, and Manuel out to our house and they were really great.  They sent someone out promptly, they called me 30 minutes in advance to let me know they were on the way, they were polite, tidy and clean when they arrived and they fixed the problem very quickly.  It turned out to be a MUCH smaller issue that cost less than $100 to fix!  They answered all my questions, explained things to me and showed me exactly what was wrong.  Overall EXCELLENT service - they will be our plumber for all future plumbing needs.

Simply Sweets are the best cupcakes and desserts in Phoenix. I have now used them for more than 15 events including kids parties, adult parties, graduations, and the entire dessert spread for my wedding. I can't say enough good things about the quality and presentation of these desserts! They are FABULOUS! I won't go anywhere else now.   LOVE LOVE LOVE SIMPLY SWEETS!

Absolutely fabulous!  My girlfriends signed us up for a class with Maggie and it was one of the most fun birthdays I've ever had.  Despite many of us being "decent" chefs at home, we all learned new recipes, cooking tips and techniques.  After creating our masterpieces, we sat down and enjoyed a fantastic meal.  It was so much fun and I can't wait to go back and do more with Maggie - she was absolutely wonderful!  Thank you for a great time and a wonderful learning experience in your kitchen!

We love True Food.  Street Tacos are awesome, and so is the Miso Blackened Cod.  This is one of our favorite places to go for two reasons:  It's healthy, and it's consistent.  Everything about it is consistent, including the high quality/friendly service.  I've eaten here at least 10 times and never had a bad experience.  Be prepared to wait for a table - it's usually busy (since it's awesome)...  but it's well worth the wait and both the Biltmore and Quarter are nice locations to walk around while you wait for your table!

Love love love Tryst.  I've been there about 6 or 7 times now and I'm never disappointed.  The food is good - always.  And it's consistent.  The service is nothing special, but it's always efficient (which is what I need at lunchtime).  They are now open for dinner as well.  I recommend the sweet potato tater tots - great to share as a side dish!  Also, the Kahlua pork sandwich is spectacular.  I'm sure it's on the more fattening side for lunch - but worth the calories and just hit the gym that night.  Their salads are also top-notch!  They have a nice outdoor space, so you can also get some fresh air at lunchtime.

It was OK... BUT...  they don't take American Express.  I realize this might sound picky... but it seemed strange that a restaurant (in a high tourist area) doesn't take AMEX - especially in this day and age.    Ok - moving on from that disappointment - the food was great.  I had a sandwich and my friend had a salad.  Both were very good and we thought nice value for the prices.  We also had GREAT coffee.  Beautifully prepared cap & latte.  The service was super friendly and accommodating.  The owner came over and chatted with us and was a really nice lady.   I love to support a local spot near my house and the food was great.  I would have given it 5 stars if they took AMEX...  I wouldn't take a crowd or have a business meeting there since I can't use my preferred credit card.  But I would go back for a quick bite with someone.

It's tough to make Kosher food so consistently good.  Mozart does it!  Their food is top-notch and I can always bring it to friends who keep kosher - knowing that they will be very happy with the quality of the food.  I've tried a number of meals here - all of which were very good.  I've also ordered take-out a number of times and everything is always ready to go on time.  I'm a fan for sure!  They are consistently good!

We just used Simple Electric for a problem with the electricity along one wall of our bedroom where we lost power.  They were very easy to schedule with (and I did a reschedule as well - and they were flexible).  They showed up in the timeslot they promised and explained on the phone that there would be a $49 service fee for coming to the house.  It turned out to be a very simple issue with a wire in a light socket, and took the gentleman less than 15minutes to identify and fix.  So from a service perspective - they were top notch.  Then came the cost...  and that's where they lost my 5-star rating.  It was $144.  This seems...  unreasonable.  The electrician did tell my husband the ballpark cost when he found the problem, but at that point - we needed the fix done and he was at the house (and we were $50 in for the call out).  I feel like they had us stuck because he was already there and we were already paying $50 for him to show up... so another $100 for less than 15min of work is just absolutely ridiculous.  Including drive time from their office down the road - it wasn't even 30 minutes of time invested.  I absolutely believe in paying for good service (and there's was good) - but this felt like we were "taken for a ride" on the cost.  UPDATE:  So, no less than 10 minutes after I posted my above review, Katie called and left me a message from Simple Electric... She asked that I call back so that she could talk to me about my service and offer me a partial refund based on what I felt a "fair price" is for the work they completed.  Impressive.  Often, customer service isn't just about getting it right the first time - but a strong recovery when it isn't perfect for the customer.  Not only are they clearly customer-centric in their servicing ethos, but they were extremely responsive!   Updated my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars...  and I will call Katie back later today.  Nicely done Simple Electric...

I saw Dr LaTowsky for the first time to have a small birth mark removed from my face that I was concerned about.  Her office was clean, new and easy to find.  Her staff were INCREDIBLY friendly and warm the moment I arrived from the front desk all the way through to the exam room.  Dr LaTowsky was wonderful.  She has excellent bedside manner, explained everything very clearly to me and the procedure was absolutely painless.  What impressed me the most is how carefully she executed the procedure to ensure that I would have minimal scarring on my face - and to make it unnoticeable to the naked eye.   I've already recommended her to two people just in the short time since I left her office.  I would go back without hesitation, I think the entire office is great!

Fun place!  We used a Groupon for our first visit and it was tons of fun.  We had kids aged 2, 5 and 13.  All three played on the trampolines and had a blast.  The place is clean, we'll supervised for safety and has a great variety.  Trampolines, dodge ball on trampolines, foam pit, bounce castles for little kids, a cafe and tables/chairs for parents to relax.  There's also arcade games.  We will be back for sure.

It was so-so.  The service was fine.  But the experience wasn't anything special, and the food was very hit or miss.  The sushi wasn't great, but some of the Chinese options were better.  Short ribs and fried rice were some of the better choices.  I wouldn't go back...  it was ok, but not worth a return trip.

Food is awesome, but the service sucks (especially the hostesses).  Their street tacos are my personal favorite there.  We really like most of the varieties we've tasted and they have good meat/vegetarian options.  We also like their guacamole a lot.  It's especially nice that the guac is served with homemade large chips.  I also recommend the calamari appetizer.  If you're a calamari fan - it's really great and unlike other calamari I've tasted.  The service is what keeps them from getting a "5 star" from us.  Their hostesses (on 3 different occasions) are snooty and cold.  They seem 'bothered' that they are there to help anyone walking in the door and they act like their seating us at the most exclusive club in town instead of a nice neighborhood Mexican spot.  They need to hire some host staff who are genuinely warm and friendly - it would make a BIG difference in people's willingness to wait for a table instead of walking away.  The servers are mixed.  I've had a couple that were awesome - and a couple that were forgetful and slow.  But they've all been friendly.  LOVE the food...  hoping they perfect the service.

I can't say enough good things about this place.  I've been here a bunch of times with my kids, girlfriends and I've even hosted a corporate event here.  This place is awesome.  It's so much fun to make all these great gifts.  We've done soap, candles, fused glass and cake decorating.  Next time we're trying the pottery painting.  The staff are SUPER helpful, the ambiance is totally fun and the variety of activities can't be beat.  The owner, Michelle, is incredibly nice and accommodating and her event coordinator, Cassandra, is also really lovely to deal with.  This is a great afternoon with your friends, family or work buddies.  It's also an awesome idea for gift giving since you MAKE everything there!  I LOVE this place.

So - I've waited to write this review until I had tasted a fair number of items from this bakery near our house.  At this point - I've got enough to give my assessment.    The good: their brownies are pretty decent and I've served them at a party with good success.    The average: Their cookies are so-so.  I've had better for less money.  Specifically, the sugar cookies are too hard on the outside compared to how soft they are on the inside and the other cookies I tasted were all far too sweet.    The bad:  Lastly - the cupcakes (which is what we all care about).  They're average.  The salted caramel is the best I've had of their flavors (and yes, I've pretty much tasted them all).  The salty peanut butter caramel one would be good - but twice when we've tried it, the pretzels on top have been stale (which is gross).  The vanilla is ok, but really too sweet and not enough 'vanilla' flavor.  And the double chocolate is good, but again... not great.  Most of their icings are too sweet and sugary tasting.    Nothing I've had there is terrible - but nothing blew me away considering how many good bakeries there are in town.  I'm sticking with Simply Sweets for my cupcake and cake orders for parties... and we will support some of the other local bakeries for our 'impulse' dessert cravings!

Love Orangetheory (OTF).  I've been a member since they opened this location and I work out 3-4 times per week here.  They have TONS of class times and all their trainers are really awesome.  I was really out of shape when I joined the gym and my fitness level is immensely better since I started my OTF workouts.   I really like all the trainers.  It you REALLY want to work hard, try Darren's workout...  he does this BRUTAL 5-minute squat/lunge section that is so hard (but so good for you)!  Everyone there knows the clients who walk in the door, and they really take their time to help anyone new to learn how to participate in the workout.  It is not the cheapest workout in town - but it is DEFINITELY the best - really well-worth the investment.

Recently took my 5 year old into this Urgent Care for a double ear infection after our pediatrician's office was closed for the day.  We were very lucky and it was fairly quiet when we went in - so the wait was really short.  I think we waited less than 10minutes.  The nurse and doctor were both great.  they were quick and efficient, but attentive to us.  We had a fairly clear issue, and they resolved it quickly and were really great with my son, who was clearly nervous about a trip to the doctor.  I would happily use this place again.  According to my paperwork, our provider was Shung.  He was great!

Love it!  Went to Milagro for the first time and was delighted with lunch.  Ate three tacos (short ribs, green Chile pork and mahi) and they were all unusual and DELICIOUS.  My hubby had Philadelphia torta.  Also amazing.  The salsa and guacamole were fantastic.  Just a wonderful meal all around and very inexpensive for a spectacular lunch.   We will be back for dinner.

Best coffee in town - and they are SO friendly and helpful.  I really love this coffee and the fact that their drive-thru is fast.  I am so excited that they've opened this location because there wasn't one near our house - and now we have a local Dutch Bros!  This coffee rocks and the staff are spectacular!

love it, love it, love it.  Been going to Portillos for years in Chicago and now in Scottsdale.  The hot dogs are the best!!!  My husband really likes their burgers and fries.  My new menu favorite in the chicken and fruit poppyseed salad.  It's YUMMY!!!

We like this place a lot.  We've had take-out from here at least 10-15 times and find that the food is consistently good and tasty.  WE're big fans of the Fish Taco Mountain (which you can get without rice if you are eating low-carb).  It's delicious and really filling.  Frequently, I can't finish the whole thing.  We're so happy that they've moved into the neighborhood.

Awesome place. Just had our second meal here and it was even better the second time.  The food is creative, but not obscure.  All the flavors are wonderful and the staff are incredibly knowledgeable about the food and drinks.  The Brussel salad is amazing, as is the grilled octopus and burrata.   Great spot for a date or evening with friends.

Loved this place.  Went for lunch and had a small salad and split pizza with a friend.  The experience of "making" your pizza by seeing all the toppings in front of you is awesome, and it cooks pretty quickly in that wood-fired oven.  The staff were super friendly - the owner even cleared out plates and checked to make sure we were enjoying our meal.  Service was great. Price was reasonable.  Food was excellent.  It will be a place I go to again and again!

I love the ambiance of the restaurant and the high volume of staff to keep things moving.  It was busy, but the service remained fast and friendly regardless of the high volume of people there.  What I didn't love was the salad and the lack of discussion about what I was ordering.  They prepared me a small salad, I wanted a large but couldn't tell what they were doing.  Once I realized it was a small it was too late.  Also, the added items (chicken, egg, tomato, etc) was WAY too small of a serving for a lunch.  I was less than two bites of chicken - maybe 1-2ounces total..  and about 1/4 of a hard-boiled egg.  I'm not a big eater - but I was pretty hungry when I left the restaurant.  Also - WAY too much dressing - it was drowning in dressing.  They were so focused on keeping the line moving (and I understand they need to get people through at lunchtime), but they didn't take enough time to let me make decisions about my order.  Large salad, not small.  Extra chicken please.  LESS dressing, etc.    It could  be great if they improved the service at the counter and actually gave people a moment to order what they want... and if they consider actually adding a decent serving of ingredients to the salads.

Love this store - it's my favorite place to shop for furniture.  The stock changes pretty regularly - so you need to keep popping in to find the perfect pieces for your home, but I have been slowly acquiring pieces from this store for a few years and I'm really thrilled with how they look in my home.  They will deliver to your home (usually within a day).    The best part is that every piece I buy there is commented on when people walk into my home - everyone loves the furniture and they all ask where I got it.   My style is contemporary with a bit of SE Asian rustic mixed in - and they also have a ton of modern and traditional furniture/decor as well.  Prices are VERY reasonable for good quality!    Ask for Betty - she's the best!

I love this place.  Meals are good, coffee is amazing, ambiance is great and the service is consistent.   I love the space, it's good during the day for reading, working, meeting friends or grabbing coffee.   Their private rooms are awesome for dinner parties.  I continue to come back...  it's awesome.

Love this new gem.  The service was warm and friendly, and the food was magnificent.  We had mussels, scallops, beef and salad.  All was amazing...   and the desserts are unreal!  We loved it for dinner and will be back for lunch too!

This was the review I wrote for this dealership last year....  but it ended up on the Camelback Hyundai yelp page because the dealerships used to be linked...  The did respond to this review, suggesting I call them.  I DID call them (4 times) after they posted that and they never returned my calls...    so here is the KIA review: =========================================================  All around bad experience at this dealership.  We spent a lot of time researching cars and settled on a Kia Sorrento as being the right car for us.  We then went through our  bank's car buying program and found the most competitive price at Camelback Kia.  BEWARE!  The prices you get through buying programs are not transparent and we paid THOUSANDS more when we showed up for our appt at Camelback Kia.  For example, we were charged for window tinting... but we didn't actually care for having our windows tinted... "too late, it's already on the car and you have to pay for it".  Same story with tire upgrade, some paint protection, etc.  They charge you for a bunch of crap that you don't want - so the pricing you are told is totally inaccurate.  I'm sure this isn't unique to this dealer - but aggravating nonetheless.    The real issue came in with our keys.  When we left the dealership, they had LOST the key to the car and only had one copy.  They promised us they would send the new one to us within a few weeks and gave me a woman's name (MICHELLE) who would take care of it.  No joke, I called EIGHT times to get that key over MONTHS.  I spoke with the manager, left voicemails for a bunch of people and they NEVER called back or got us our key (which we really needed so we would have two car keys).  We finally called Kia head office.  They were SUPER nice and apologetic.  They called the dealership, called us back and told us to call a manager there who would take care of it.  When we called him, he never called back.  FINALLY, my husband went in after months of waiting and calling.  They insisted that because we waited for months, we now had to BUY the key for $350.  ARE THEY KIDDING?  We had been trying to get that key for months.  But they wouldn't budge.  So we were out of pocket tons of money, two trips to the dealership and lost a good 4 hours of our lives on the phone to get a key that we were entitled to on our brand new car!  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  The Good: we like the Kia Sorrento and it drives very nicely  I will compliment also the Kia head office on two things: very nice and courteous when we called them to try to get the key... AND they called us from the HQ after we bought the car to thank us for our business and offer us a free oil change at Camelback Kia on our first service.  After our experience, we are NOT getting our Kia serviced there.  We would rather just have our $350 back.  We are also now in the market for ANOTHER new car to replace our Pilot.  We are intentionally not buying a Kia (despite enjoying the Sorrento that we purchased) because we just don't trust their service after the key fiasco.  So, we're buying a new Pilot (purely based on that silly key) since Camelback HONDA has always been so good to us and does do all of our servicing.  I'll be shocked if Kia thrives if this reflects how their dealerships behave.

Ugh,  I normally like Clean Freak... but this one is horrible.  The higher pressure selling from the guys when u pull in is uncomfortable.  Then, the sped me thru check out so fast I couldn't put my loyalty card in before he was shuffling me along... so no loyalty credit for my wash today.  They are so 'slick' and overly eager to get more money from you and it's really uncomfortable.    Not going back.

Good drinks, awesome sushi, good guacamole.  Their brunch is so interesting, and I can't say enough about the mushroom omelette.  It's fantastic.  Their guacamole are all good, especially the bacon guac.  Their sushi is so unusual,  and I'm always pleased with what we order.  They also have great drinks and bartenders.  They had a dj the last evening we were there, which was very cool.  Great spot for groups or date night!

We ate here for dinner on Saturday night and had a nice meal.  The outdoor patio was cooled with misters, so we sat outside despite it being a bit warm outside.  The patio was lovely.  The service was VERY good and attentive.  Our server didn't do a great job on wine recommendations, but other than that, he was fantastic. We tasted the bufola mozz appetizer, shrimp appetizer, seafood platter, chicken parm and the seafood pasta.  Everyone was happy with their meals.  Nobody was AMAZED, but we were all very satisfied and thought the food was cooked beautifully (and healthy... no overuse of oils/butter, etc).  I would have gone 5 stars if the wine recommendations had been better.  We will be back!

Frustrating experience here.  The guy sold me hard on a detail service, so I took it.  He said it would take 40-45minutes.  After an hour and a half, I insisted on leaving because I was already very late to take my child to an appointment.  I plan on calling to ask for a refund since they didn't finish the detailing.  Beware, they sell you hard and over-promise.  They are paid on commission obviously...

Love Joe's Midnight Run!  We've already been twice in one week and this place is fabulous.  You can eat shared plates of apps/entrees.  You just can't go wrong.  So far we are fans of the short ribs, wings, curried cauliflower and steaks.  My husband had the burger and it's INSANE.  he loved it!  It's really unusual.  We've also had the apple pie dessert which was out of this world.  Then it gets better...  it's all 80's.  Just when you think the night can't go better, the A-Team comes on the TV's!  It's awesome.    They have a fabulous wine list and awesome bar tenders.  Whoever picked out their liquors did amazing.  Unusual choices, along with items we recognized - and it was all awesome.    They have an open kitchen and we recommend sitting up at the food bar to watch them cook in their amazing ovens!   It's, like, totally rad!
