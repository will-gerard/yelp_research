UGH. Try to avoid this place if you can. The employees here are extremely RUDE! I had a reusable water bottle in my backpack and it had a half of inch of water(obviously less than 3 oz) and they made me get out of line told me they were going to throw my $20+ filtered water bottle away, they finally gave it back to me and made me go threw security all over again. WHAT?!

After moving from San Diego, where I could find some of the most delicious Mexican food it took me a while to stumble upon great tasting mexican food in Arizona. This place has really good quality food but the portions are on the small side especially for burritos.

This place is amazing! Gorgeous property that is very widespread and has plenty of stuff to do. Their spa is to die and ranked top spa in the area. Everything is very authentic to Arizona on property and staff is very helpful and friendly.  Their concierge department is amazing and extremely helpful! Jessica is amazing and remembered my name while speaking with me and helping me decide my trip around Arizona

I went with my servers choice while visiting this restaurant, I ended up having the soy salmon. It was definitely a great choice and was delicious to the last bite but was kind of on the expensive side. The interior of this restaurant is gorgeous, the staff was a little bit on the slow side though.

The beer selection here disappointed me, very laid back bar that can be a great hang out for friends on the weekend. The drinks are fairly priced but the whole theme of the restaurant/bar threw me off. It was disappointing that the whole patio was smoking friendly I do not smoke and could barely breathe out there so I was left with the only option to be inside....disappointing.

YUMMMMMMM. All you can eat quality meat?! This steakhouse is great, I can never go to Fogo without leaving and feeling so full that I can barely walk.

Ok. First things first, this is the location near my friends apartment and I go to Starbucks almost everyday. I walk in to the lobby the first day and I ordered a breakfast sandwich(and somehow they gave me a lemon loaf cake which they were annoyed to exchange even though I had my receipt in hand), and I also ordered a iced white mocha. The girl on the register was obviously new and confused and it took her a really long time to get everything in the system and the manager on duty was obviously annoyed with her asking for help. The second time I went to this location I used the drive thru thinking it would be better, my friend got a black coffee and I got an iced coffee figuring this order was a lot harder to mess up....WRONG. My iced coffee didn't have WM sweetener like I asked it had classic syrup and cream instead. And to make matters worse... I am an employee of Starbucks. I gave the girl my employee numbers and she said "wow you are a dinosaur" UMM THANKS?! It has the potential to be a good location but far from it now.

Food was so good, service was sub par though :( we walked in with a party of 5 ordered a bottle of Cabernet worth $100 and got our servers switched on us with no knowledge about it and didn't get our dinner order put in until 45mins plus if not more. Super disappointed that the food was amazing and the service wasn't.

Ummm lets change the name of this place from FastMed to SLOW Med and it would be more accurate. I waited in the waiting area for almost an hour and a half before being called to the back! There was 2 other people waiting when I arrived, the next lady in after me actually got so annoyed with the wait she requested her copay refund and left! The actually doctor and staff were nice, but moved at a snails pace. I would find another place before going back here again. #NEXT

Alright I have waited until I moved out to write this review. I should start off by saying that a new property management company came in July and have honestly been trying to make the place a lot better and I will give them credit for that. HOWEVER this still doesn't fix everything.   Lets start with the cons: -They require a 60 DAY NOTICE, to move out; don't get screwed like we did and have to paid "market price" for that extra 30 days you didn't want to live there when you went to give a 30 day notice. -Kitchen lights burn out every other week(in the year I lived here we must have gone through at least 20 light bulbs) -Apartments have weird vents for air circulation that lead from bedrooms into living area, so if you are in your dark room trying to sleep and the light in the kitchen/dining/living area is turned on it shines straight into your room via the vent.  -Don't even get me started on parking..... first off you SHARE the parking structure with the business building next-door Monday-Friday(btw they just build a brand new parking structure for them that has been open for 6+ months that they don't use?), which they then made a rule that your guests are not allowed to park in the parking structure and if you want more than 1 parking spot per apartment get ready to pay a monthly rent on that second spot. It wouldn't be too bad but a lot of the business people are lazy and park OUTSIDE the complex and take up all the parking that could possibly be guest parking, long story short.... you aren't allowed to have friends that want to come over because their is NO PARKING.  - They installed these speed bumps to "slow down residents during nights and weekends", like I mentioned before you share the parking structure with the business building...guess what when they office employees leave you can DRIVE AROUND the majority of the speed bumps. The ones you can't are on BLIND corners.... who seriously puts speed bumps on blind corners. Speaking of this I have a Camaro and I had to get my alignment on my BRAND NEW CAR fixed because the angle of the corner speed bumps threw off my alignment. $70 later I was one angry resident  -All the awesome events that happened when we first moved in are gone, what happened to the Saturday mimosa and muffin brunch, the pool side taco party, the wine wednesday, the yoga in the community room? (All free events) -When my roommate and I moved in we were told it was a 21 and up community..... and now there are 18 year olds running around all the time? -Under my roommates sink there was a giant hole of sheet rock missing, we told maintenance and they came and fixed it, towards the end of our lease we get a knock on our door and the new maintenance team asks to see if we have water damage because there is a hole in the hallway.... that hole under the sink they patched was a water pipe slowly leaking so the cabinet was completely mildew and molded and water damaged.   I can keep going on and on about the cons but you pretty much get the point by now. The only positives that I can say is the new management is trying to make things better.

Kind of on the expensive side but hey what bar isn't right? Staff of very good looking people. Hung out here for about a half hour or so, great atmosphere.
