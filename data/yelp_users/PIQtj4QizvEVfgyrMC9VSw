Great bar in Old Town!!!  Always a fun crowd with an ultra lounge feel.  We like hangin' out on the patio.  LOTS of good memories at this place.

I've taken dozens of classes and seminars at this school over the last 10 years.  They are quite simply the most professional and best real estate school in Arizona.   The instructors and staff truly care about the success of their students and do an outstanding job.  I'll continue to recommend this school to anyone looking to further their career in real estate.

Outstanding Italian food in Old Town tonight.  We started with a antipasto and calamari - both good enough to get us excited about the entrees.  The Chicken Parmigiana and Shrimp Scampi were incredible.  I doubt you could go wrong with anything on the menu.  Definitely a leisurely pace and couldn't be farther from a chain restaurant.  Fresh ingredients, an outstanding menu and authentic charm make this a local favorite.

Was pressed for time and stopped in for a simple oil change on my car.  I asked for synthetic but didn't specify which one.  I'm not sure which brand they used but my "simple" oil change was $120.  Roughly double what I pay anywhere else.  I don't mind paying extra for convenience but that's a little ridiculous.  Never going back to this place.

Great location.   I typically have at least one "impulse buy" and always seem to leave with more than I need.  Excellent staff and most people don't know that the tire center opens at 7am.

Probably the worst haircut of my adult life.  These people are nice but very slow and clearly not very skilled at their chosen profession.  I say this knowing full well that I was going to get a cheap ($13) haircut.  Going here was a big mistake.  They don't even clean their combs and clipper attachments between clients.  Gross.  Did I mention that going here was a big mistake?  Go south to the one on Thomas and Scottsdale.  They do a much better job.

Fantastic wine bar.  Intimate patio and a great selection of South American wines.  Pick a good bottle, sit near the fire and relax the night away!

First they sold us soup they didn't have.   Then they gave my sandwich away to someone else.   I walked over to Chipotle.  Mistakes happen all the time - but they should at least act like they care.

Agreed.   Those bad reviews are pretty old.   Was there on Friday the 24th and these guys did a great job.   Place was clean and the ingredients were fresh.   Be back soon.

Excellent food and service each time I've been there.  Upscale and hip atmosphere and a great location in Old Town.  A nice mix of entree's on the menu and some very creative drinks.  Happy hour 7 days a week until 6:30 is worth noting.  This is now my #1 spot for Chinese in Scottsdale.

Ciara is the best!  She truly cares about her clients and did a great job with our dog over a recent 10 day vacation.   She takes the time to learn about each family - routines, eating habits, favorite things, etc.  We even got updates while we were gone.  Recommend her to your friends - they'll thank you for it.
