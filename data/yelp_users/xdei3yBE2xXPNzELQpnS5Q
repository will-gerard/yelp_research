This is probably the best greek food I've had in Arizona.  They lose a star because it was overly priced per the proportions serviced.

My father and I recently moved here and we really like it.   There's a pool and a gym both look very nice.  We live in a two bedroom back by the golf course with a great view. They have garages you can get one.  The clubhouse is amazing and they even have a really cool movie theater.   We have yet to have any problems ,and we've been here for about 5 months. It's really quiet at night time too. Our neighbor upstairs are so friendly they came down and greeted us with cookies when we moved in.

I have been coming here for about 5 years I really like it and I plan to keep coming here. They do get quite busy on most days  but I like going in the mornings for the breakfast especially Sunday. I have never been let down and the service rocks!

The best place for nails and eye brow waxing! Very affordable and I recommend paying in cash for the discount!

They have such a large selection of boots and cute clothes.  Only downside is it is pretty expensive on certain things !

If you like name brand purses and Nordstrom this is your mall! They even have banana republic!    I recommend only coming here if you have big money to burn because it is a high end mall.

This mall is slowly dying there is countless empty shops and dark corners with signs coming soon. This mall use to busy and lively 5 years ago but that's long gone.  The only great part about this mall is it is the cheapest compared to any other mall.  On a healthy tip: DO NOT USE THE RESTROOMS HERE EVER!

I was very unsatisfied with the service I received. They were rude and acted like it was killing them to simply cut my hair. I know I have long but seriously it's thin! I didn't have any coloring done and my hair naturally drys straight. I will never becoming back here. I asked the gentle men for just a half an inch he cut off three inches! I refuse to ever come back!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe the attitude he gave me after I told him I was not pleased with my hair cut!
