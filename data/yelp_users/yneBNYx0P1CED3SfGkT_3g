So food is great! BUT service OMG slow and no awareness. So took forever to get food when not busy (10 people sitting half with food). Then I wanted to get a to go box. Well I went to front of line to quickly ask for one and cashier Never even noticed me. Was kinda in front of him. Then walking back to my seat a cool came out and sat behind me for his break. Asked him if they had boxes. Told me to go to another counter for phone in orders. Well then I was in line for a while as that took forever. I gave up told my girlfriend how that didn't work by the cool and he didn't even notice. Never checked if I got the box or anything.  So food good, service blows.

After my review I was contacted by the management apologizing for my experience and requesting more detail to address the issue or at least look into it. That is really nice and was prompt from my post. They do care and the food is great. For these reasons I updated my stars from 2 to 4.
