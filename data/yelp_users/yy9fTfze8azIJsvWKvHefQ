I used the facilities at the YMCA a few times during my recent stay at the Hilton next door. I appreciated that hotel guests got access to a full-sized gym instead of a dinky hotel gym. I found the layout of the YMCA to be cramped and a bit uncomfortable. Everything is so exposed and I prefer gyms with a few nooks and crannies where I can lay on the floor and exercise in semi-privacy.  The hours make sense for the office environment but I really wish it would've stayed open later than 9pm.  I found the cardio machines to be in excellent shape and I enjoyed watching Law & Order, SVU while sweating on the elliptical (go ahead, make fun of the fact that I like ellipticals).  The best part of the YMCA is how clean it is. There is cleaning spray and a towel stationed at every machine and I noticed that people were very good about cleaning up after themselves.

There were more cacti at this place than I ever wanted to see in my life.  It's pretty shocking that you're charged $15 to see what you can see for free throughout Arizona.  I mean, you can see the same "plants" along highways, at hotels, and in front of people's homes.  I understand that given the harsh weather, it's difficult to have a wide variety of plant-life.  But after the 1,000th cactus, I was done.  Sorry to be harsh but now I really appreciate the botanical gardens in California.

What a ripoff! For $50, we each got to race once. First, we had to pay $5/per person just to be allowed to sign up for races. Then, we were told that the wait was going to be 1.5 hours.   When it was finally time for our race, it was underwhelming. They kept slowing down the cars; I'm not sure how I was supposed to race when half of the laps were at reduced speeds. Also, the space was pretty small so some of the turns were incredibly tight. It was over in about 10 minutes. That's equal to $150/hr. Uh, no thank you!

Yawn...unless you have a child under the age of 5, don't waste your time at McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park.  I know, what were we (3 adults) thinking? I've done plenty of things geared toward kids that I've enjoyed immensely.  This was not one of them.  The place was packed and it took us a while just to find a parking space.    We ended up buying 12 tickets for $10.  First, we stood in line for 20 minutes to ride the train.  The seats were ridiculously uncomfortable and the ride was so boring.  The train ride was about 10 minutes long and went through the park, next to all of the picnickers.  As we went through the "tunnel," all of the parents started screaming like crazy.  I just wanted to cover my ears.    Since we had 6 more tickets left, we went to the museum.  The museum had some interesting exhibits but it also had some creepy looking mannequins.  I was in and out within 10 minutes.  What a complete waste of 1 hour of my time.

I feel sorry for people who think this is as good as Thai food gets. They have no idea what they are missing out on.  After several days of eating Italian and American food, we decided to go "Asian" and chose Malee's based on the high average Yelp rating.  My first impression was good.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance and the service is pretty good.  But I was shocked when I saw the menu.   The prices are outrageous.  It ended up costing $62 for 3 people.  I'm pretty sure I could've gotten the same amount of food for half the price at any Thai restaurant in LA.  We ordered Crab Rangoon, Tom Ga Kai soup, Calamari salad, and Roasted Duck Curry.  The Crab Rangoon lacked crab and the sauce did not go well with the fried dumpling.  One of my pet peeves is when a restaurant defaults to white meat chicken without asking me for my opinion. News Flash! There are many of us out there who prefer the juiciness and tenderness of dark meat chicken.  Anyway, the Tom Ga Kai had all white meat chicken and it tasted dry and flavorless. Furthermore, the soup was too thick and was more like a stew.  The soup base itself was far too sweet.  I order this soup at every Thai restaurant I go to so I think I've had it enough times to be able to say that this one was the worst.   I am also a huge fan of Roasted Duck Curry and this was the worst Roasted Duck Curry I've had at a Thai restaurant anywhere.  Even though this was not a good Roasted Duck Curry, we all agreed that it was the best thing we ordered.  How sad.

I can't believe I almost overslept on my last day in Arizona and missed out on this gem.  Good thing we made it just in time for the 9am tour.  90 minutes may seem like a long time but it flew by because Ernie, our guide, was so informative and interesting.  I felt like I got my full $32 worth out of the experience.  In a way, Taliesin West is like a museum. But unlike other "museum" tours I've been on, everything was very hands on.  We were encouraged to experience the architecture and space the way it was designed.  We sat in the Frank Lloyd Wright designed chairs in his living room and visited his living quarters.  We also saw his office space and various entertainment venues.  Every inch of the space was designed deliberately. The repeating geometric patterns were very interesting.  What was surprising to me was that there is an architecture school on site that offers bachelors and masters degrees.   The school was started during the Great Depression as a means for Wright to obtain a steady income stream despite the decline in demand due to the economic downturn.  Ernie enthusiastically described the responsibilities of the original students (aka apprentices).  My conclusion?  They were basically Wright's slaves.  When Mr. Wright wanted to build a road, he asked his apprentices to pave a path.  When Mr. Wright wanted rocks to construct Taliesin West, he asked his apprentices to carry 1-man, 2-man, and 3-man -sized rocks from the surrounding area.  And do you know where he let him apprentices sleep?  In tents and sleeping bags. All I can say is that I hope the students today are treated better than that.  But in the end, I'm here to rate the tour and not the students. The tour was fun and educational and I would recommend it to everyone visiting the area.

So expensive and unsatisfying.  If it wasn't because my options were limited on Thanksgiving, I would've never given Caffe Boa a chance.  But I was desperate and hungry so Caffe Boa was the first of our string of disappointing dining experiences in Central Arizona.  Ok, I've had worse but I've definitely also eaten far better food in my life.  The best part of the meal was the free bread. It was actually very good and the dipping sauces (especially the chipotle one) were tasty.  We ordered the Shrimp Adriatico ($10) to start.  As far as paid dishes go, the appetizer was the best thing we got.  The sauce was marinara-esque with a tang.  If you don't like acidity, you will not like this. The flatbread was delicious and it's also fun to soak up the sauce with the complimentary regular bread as well.   We also ordered Lobster Ravioli ($22), Angus Burger ($16), and Voodoo Penne ($8 half portion).   The Lobster Ravioli may be the most overpriced, overrated dish on the menu.  Are you serious?  $22 for 5 tiny ravioli?  I would love to see what a half portion is.  What's worse is that the filling tasted like imitation crab.  It was the worst thing on the table. You would think a burger is a safe bet but nope, not the case either.  I know we didn't ask for well-done but the burger, bun and fries came out beyond well-done.  Everything was charred.  $16 for a burger is more than I'd pay for most "gourmet" burgers in LA. Finally, let's talk about the Voodoo Penne.  This was actually an excellent value compared to everything else.  A half portion is more than enough for the average individual for lunch.  At only $8, that's pretty good.  Too bad the pasta tasted very average - kind of like the type of pasta I can make at home in 10 minutes.  It was 1:30pm on Thanksgiving and there were only 2 other tables of people at the restaurant. You would think that if there are 2 servers for only 3 tables of patrons, the service would be excellent.  Instead, the servers often mysteriously disappeared for 5 or 10 minutes at a time.  My friends did ask for a lot of hot water with lemon and honey.  We appreciate all of the free lemon slices, honey, and bread we received. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of our meal.

I got to the airport super early for my flight and I was dreading the wait. But the free wifi at McCarran was so great and the wait passed quickly.   Security was relatively fast and the little tram that you take to the D Gates is really fun.   And if you haven't lost enough money in Vegas already, you can always play some slots while you're waiting to board.

I wanted to see Thunder from Down Under but the guy in our group gave me a dirty look and suggested Penn & Teller instead.  The only negative thing is that because the show is at the Rio, you are forced to take a cab.  And cabs can be so hard to get at night.  Anyway, Penn & Teller were very entertaining.  I loved that most of the tricks they did were very low-tech so you know that their magic is not in flashing lights or fancy sets.

Not quite as amazing as "O" but it sure beats Mystere and Zumanity.   Vegas shows are expensive but once you experience Ka, you will understand why they charge so much.  The theatre is incredible and the sets are extremely sophisticated.  We got discounted tickets through Tix4Tonight and I didn't bother to buy the Category 1 tickets.  I can understand the benefit of sitting up close but Ka is a 270 degree sensory experience so it's not really necessary get super-close to the performers.  For Cirque du Soleil virgins, I recommend a more traditional Cirque show.  However, for veterans of Vegas and traveling Cirque du Soleil shows like myself, Ka is different enough from the others so you don't feel like you're watching the same acts over and over again.    My two favorite parts were not acrobatic at all.  The beach scene with the huge crab, centipede, sea turtle and starfish was cute and captivating.  The shadow puppet act was incredible - never have I ever seen such realistic shadows of animals that express so much emotion. I was constantly wow-ed by the creativity and the quality of the performance.

So much hype! We were promised that this was going to be an amazing experience and it really wasn't.  Maybe my taste buds and stomach were not ready for the explosion of food since I had gone to another buffet earlier in the day.  The "highlight" of this buffet is the crab legs.  I ate them only because I figured that it was the only way I could get my money's worth. But the crab legs were cold, salty and not even that good.  Plus, you have to wait in a long line just to get to it; it's not worth it.  The prime rib was actually pretty good. I did like it.  I also liked the gelato selection at the dessert area.  Speaking of desserts, they were probably better than the entrees.  The hot brownie was also delicious! The creme brulee was below-par.  While the top was fine, the custard underneath tasted very odd.  I've had a lot of creme brulees in my life and this one didn't make the top 20.  I'm glad I gave it a try but one time is enough.

My friend and I wanted somewhere cheap and quiet to stay in and the strip hotels (except Excalibur, Circus Circus, Stratosphere, and other undesirable locations) were all too expensive for our last minute booking.  Based on various reviews on the AAA website and Tripadvisor, we decided on the Renaissance. It's not on the strip and a taxi costs $7-$12 to get to hotels like the Wynn or Paris but we definitely enjoyed our stay.    The hotel was 4* and the service was very good.  The room we got had two double beds and a good sized bathroom with separate shower & tub.  It ended up costing about $100 per night.

Olive & Ivy is so gorgeous! It's huge and super crowded. We walked in to try to have brunch and were told that there would be a 45 minute wait for a table. A few bar seats opened up so we stationed ourselves there instead. The Moscow Mules were to my liking ("Mediterranean Mules") and I ordered a tasty Lamb Gyro sandwich. I definitely had food envy when his perfectly cooked salmon arrived. It was delicious.  When 3pm hit, we also ordered bacon wrapped dates from the limited dinner menu. I wish we would've had time to try Olive & Ivy for dinner. Maybe next time!

I stayed at the Renaissance on a recent business trip and I was impressed by the hotel. The staff was super friendly and I was pleasantly surprised that there's a signature cocktail served every evening at 6pm. Whatever cocktail I had tasted just ok but hey, it was free!  The standard room was a good size and had everything I needed. The only downside is that the Internet was so slow. I had to take a quiz via email for class and I almost wasn't able to send it back to my professor in time because I had trouble sending the attachment.   The gym was really nice for a hotel. The cardio machines are hybrid, which I thought was really cool. Apparently, my pedaling of the elliptical saved several minutes of electricity. It was also open 24 hours a day for the convenience of guests. I would certainly stay at the Renaissance again if I an ever in Phoenix again.

When I first looked up the Firesky Resort online, I was really confused about the various room options.  Let me just tell you - except for very few exceptions, all of the rooms are the same.  All rooms are about 400 sf and you either get one king sized bed or two queen sized beds.  The variation in price of up to $50 per night is solely based on the view.  There are 5 buildings that surround a pool, lagoon and courtyards in a U-shape.  As you can imagine, there are rooms facing these facilities and some rooms facing the parking lot.  Even if you want to save money, DO NOT get a room that faces the parking lot.  It will feel like a motel.  The rooms that face the facilities are all pretty much the same and there's no real reason to pay extra for the pool view or lagoon view rooms.  In fact, those rooms may be noisier and have less privacy due to the amount of traffic from other hotel guests.  If I had a dog, this place would be heaven. Dog-friendly hotels are not as common as they should be and even those that are tend to put all of the dog owners in the old/nasty part of the hotel.  Not the case here - dogs ruled the resort and I didn't mind at all.  The best part of the experience was the free wine reception every evening from 5pm to 6pm.  Let's just say that I got my money's worth.  We stayed 3 nights and each of us got 2 glasses of wine each evening. No, it's not the best wine but who cares when it's free.  The firepits are also very cool but there's a limited number of them and they are always in high demand.  I also love that there's self-parking all around the hotel so you can leave your vehicle close to your room for easy access.  The hotel is good but not perfect.  For example, one day we were out from 9am to 3pm and when we returned, the room was still not made up.  I found that to be inexplicable and unacceptable.  I had to locate housekeeping to clean the room.  When we returned to the room 2 hours later, the room was clean but the maid had put 2 identical toothbrushes next to each other.  We had left one on the left side of the sink and one on the right side.  It's pretty stupid for someone to move them so we couldn't tell which one was whose.  When I called guest services to ask for new toothbrushes, they took forever to deliver them to the room.  But the overall experience was fine.  The hotel doesn't look as amazing as the website shows (but does it ever?).  We ended up paying about $150 including tax for 3 adults and considering the amount of wine we drank, I think we got a good value out of it.

We were in Scottsdale for Thanksgiving and I didn't want to sit around the hotel all evening.  Luckily, Jesterz has a special Thanksgiving Show.  The performers that evening were Dalane, Garrett, Mandy, and Paul.  Since it's improv, you never know what you're going to get.  Dalane, Mandy and Paul were good but OMG, Garrett was amazing!    For one skit, Garrett had to pretend he was an iPod so he stuck out his belly (the dial) and rubbed his belly in a counter-clockwise motion to "select" the music on the iPod. I know, it doesn't sound funny when I describe it but he was fabulous.  I didn't laugh very hard the first half hour, but that's pretty common for me when I go to comedy clubs.  I just needed to warm up.  It was an enjoyable way to spend an evening.

I arrived in Vegas by myself and I didn't want to waste money on a taxi.  I paid $6 and got a one-way token for the Executive shuttle. I was the first one on the bus and I was a little worried.  You know when you're on a shuttle and you wait a looooong time for enough other passengers to get on so the shuttle can finally leave? I didn't have that problem here.  Within 10 minutes, the shuttle was full and we were on our way.  Luckily for me, I was the first to get dropped off.  All in all, it was cheap and efficient.  However, if you have 3 people, you're probably better off taking a taxi.  The cost is about the same and you can save some extra time.

You know, Hyatt House is not bad for what it is. The location is excellent for getting around Old Town restaurants, bars, and clubs. The rooms are incredibly spacious and the breakfast is pretty good. I hear there is a reception on weekdays but we couldn't take advantage of it. The front desk staff is super nice as well!  We stayed for two nights over the weekend and had a positive experience. We didn't get a chance to lounge at the pool but there were certainly people utilizing the pool during 85 degree February days.  The only negative is that the rooms need a facelift. Also, our door was jammed and was hard to close. Given that all the rooms are accessed from the exterior, there's limited privacy since the bedroom faces the hallway where everyone walks by.

Good thing it was cheap. I guess the demand in January is low so our weekend 2 night stay cost us $300+tax+resort fee but included 2 tickets to see Le Reve and 2 brunches at the Wynn Buffet. Another bonus are the separate lines for hotel guests for Surrender and XS.  The bed was really comfortable. Too comfortable perhaps, because I passed out almost the entire weekend. The room was huge and had a beautiful view of the Wynn and the bathroom was large as well.  But little things did bug me a bit. 1) The bathroom is poorly designed for drainage and every time we took a shower or turned on the bath tub's faucet, water was everywhere. 2) Housekeeping didn't give us new lotion/shampoo/conditioner the second day even though we had used more than half of the bottle of lotion the first day. Good thing I tracked down a girl who gave me enough lotion for the next 3 weeks. 3) The TV remote stopped working the second day. 4) We had to pay the resort fee even though the pool was closed for the season.  But then again, the room didn't cost us all that much compared to other strip (less than 5*) hotels.

We walked in, bought an assorted dozen, walked out and headed for the airport. We froze the bagels as soon as we got home and there are still a couple left (it has been a month). The one that we toasted yesterday still tastes as wonderful as the first one we ate. These bagels may be the best food we got in Montreal.

Oh gosh, nasty nasty nasty. This was another one of the bf's great idea. "Oh, you planned the whole trip. I only have two requests - poutine and orange julep." How could I turn him down?  Traffic was horrendous and we were happy to finally arrive under the giant orange ball. It looked like it belongs in LA. It didn't look particularly clean but that didn't deter the bf.  The verdict? The orange julep was more watery than he expected and the burger looked worse than McDonald's. The fries were soaked in oil. Eww.

We ate at the restaurant and made a short stop at the club.  The food was really yummy and the prices seemed reasonable for Vegas (maybe that's because I had just returned from living in over-priced SF for four months).  There were about 8 of us and most of us ordered various pastas.  One of my friends had the steak and she seemed to enjoy it.  Our waiter was really fun and he made sure my friend (who was having her bachelorette party) had a great time.  After a filling dinner, we headed upstairs to the club.  It's kind of weird that there are little faucets on the bridge part before you enter the club.  My hands were not that clean from dinner so I washed them there. Haha, I'm sure that's not why they put them their but that's ok.   My friends wanted to leave the club after 10 minutes but I was having a good time.  Oh well, maybe next time.  It was really small and extremely crowded.

SOOOOOOOOO MUCH FUN! The 3 of us went to Superstition Farm for their tour last Saturday. No, we didn't have any kids with us but we may have had a better time than most of the kids.  The beginning is a bit dry. You're in the "classroom" for a while learning about random facts related to diary cows.  Moo.  After that, it's a hay ride.  Girls, let me give you one tip - Make sure you wear long pants or shorts that are long.  Hay is very uncomfortable under your butt if there isn't enough padding.  Anyway, the hay ride was entertaining but the best part had yet to come.  Once the hayride was over, the "tour" was officially over.  But everyone stuck around to check out the petting zoo. The animals were all so friendly and we got to feed them as well.  There was a hodgepodge of creatures from a young cow to sheep to rabbits and even a turkey.  Yum...just kidding.  In addition, there's a black lab on the premise that was amazing.  This dog would make an incredible soccer player.  His reaction time is unbelievable - any team would be happy to have him as a goalie.  After the animal bonding, we went to try flavored milk.  Mine was butterscotch flavored and it was just ok.  I was disappointed that the milk wasn't fresh from the farm but I guess it's not legal to serve unprocessed milk.  Since we had a Groupon, we also had a chance to try Udder Delights ice cream. At $2.50 each, I would never pay for them individually. But seeing that it was included in my "deal," we enjoyed them a lot.  Don't be embarrassed if you don't have kids.  Trust me, adults can enjoy Superstition Farm too.

Shortly after I wrote my 3 star review, Christopher contacted me. He was very apologetic about our experience and wished that we had enjoyed our meal more.  He immediately offered to refund us the cost of the meal because we weren't 100% satisfied.  After discussing his offer with my friends, we decided to take a 50% refund.  Let me just say that I was personally a little uncomfortable with this because while I have received refund/free meal offers from other businesses in the past, I've never taken them up on it.  I don't think it's about the money and I certainly don't write reviews to elicit free meals.  However, since the 3 of us split the cost of the meal evenly, I felt that it would only be fair if I took my friends' suggestions into account.   Anyway, the refund check arrived in the mail yesterday.  I decided to upgrade my review to 4 stars given the overall experience.  It's rare to find business owners who value their customers as much as Christopher.

I had the best sushi roll in my life at Wayne's Sushi Bar.  What Brah, Beef? was amazing! Seriously, who ever even thought about putting beef tenderloin on a sushi roll?  Don't doubt the combination, Wayne is a flavor genius.  Wayne and his wife Heidi are just good people but the problem is that there are only 2 of them. If you are patient and aren't too hungry, Wayne will make you some of the best sushi you've ever had.  But, if you're in a time crunch, this is not the place for you.    Like other Yelpers have said, Wayne's style is fusion sushi rolls. Usually, I avoid "fusion" foods like the plague BUT when fusion is done right, it is fabulous.   Most of the other customers seemed like regulars and they contributed to the homey atmosphere.  One of the customers was celebrating her birthday and even passed around slices of cake to everyone in the restaurant.

This place is so fancy-looking, you would think it would cost an arm and a leg.  We were wow-ed when we walked in for Thanksgiving Dinner.  I picked J&G after looking at over 30 restaurant menus.  I've never been a huge fan of turkey so I was looking for an upscale, festive dinner with lots of protein options.  Luckily, J&G served both a 3-course Thanksgiving turkey meal for $45 and everything (except the tasting menu) from the regular dinner menu.  The three of us shared what we ordered and I enjoyed the meal overall. -Steamed Shrimp Salad with Avocado and Mushroom Champagne Vinaigrette ($14): I'm not a big salad person but this was actually very good. 4* -Sweet and Sour Pork Belly Ginger-Shallot Confit ($10): Yea, don't trust those Americans when try try to go Asian. 2* -Red Wine Glazed Short Ribs ($24): This wasn't as good as it sounded. The short ribs could have been more tender. 3* -16oz Peppercorn Prime NY Steak ($47): Excellent value for the size of the steak.  I wasn't a huge fan of the sauces that were provided but the steak was cooked the way I wanted. 4* -Mac & Cheese ($9): Yummy! (But a little overpriced) 4.5* -Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes ($9): For the size of the container, this was also overpriced, but nonetheless, very tasty. 4.5* -Lemon Vanilla Creme Brulee with Lemon Sorbet ($10): You know, I was a bit disappointed by the flavor. The top didn't seem to be torched properly. 3* -Warm Chocolate Cake with Caramel Ice Cream $9): Classic, rich and delicious. 4* -Bottle of Casa Lapostolle Cuvée Alexandre 2007 ($42): Not bad for a bottle of wine at this price point. 4*  It was a feast.  The food was sophisticated, the service was good and the price was so reasonable.  Seriously $75 per person for so much food at a place with amazing ambiance and an awesome view is quite the bargain.

Yay for not having to pay to get in. We arrived before 11 on a Saturday night and the line was really long.  I was afraid that we were going to be stuck outside for hours but the line moved really quickly.  The guys monitoring the line were super nice.  My friends and I had just finished eating at Paris Buffet & I had just wrestled with a crab.  Can you believe it, he was already cooked and he still won the fight?  Anyway, I had a deep cut on my finger and it kept bleeding and the guys that worked at XS went out of their way to find me a bandaid.   There were a lot of people inside but because it's so big, I felt like I could get away from all of them if I wanted.  My friend and I danced for quite a few hours. Maybe because we're both Asian, all of the guys that approached us were Asian.  Not only were they Asian, I am convinced that the only Asian males at XS the night we were there were Korean.   Haha, too bad I'm not Korean. Anyway, I had a great time.  I usually sleep early but it was past 4am before I knew it and I wasn't even that tired.

Nooooo.... Last week this place had a 4.5* rating and that's why I chose it. But now it's 4*, just like every other restaurant.   I tried to push for the $49 early menu but I was told to stop planning like a grandma and to "live on the edge."  So I translated that to mean, schedule a 9:30 dinner?  We got to Aria by 9 and had a few drinks at the various bars. Unfortunately, those drinks distorted my expensive dining experience a bit. We re-checked in at 9:30 for our reservation and they still weren't ready for us. We almost fainted from hunger in the restaurant's bar area.  Luckily, when we were seated, we expressed our frustrations to our server and he made sure our food came our at lightning speeds.  We went with the $79 signature menu. I chose: 1) Wagyu Tartare 2) Maine Dayboat Scallops 3) 48 Hour Beef Belly 4) Crunchy Chocolate and Peanut Butter Tart  He chose: 1) Foie Gras Brulee (OMG, only now as I'm writing this review have I realized that the foie was $10 extra. Not worth it, btw). 2) Glazed Pork Belly 3) Iberico Pork Loin 4) Peach Praline Profiteroles  The standouts were the Wagyu Tartare, Maine Dayboat Scallops and the Glazed Pork Belly.  Everything else was good but not mind blowing. Service was awesome and the free bread was super tasty.

Stopped by for what I thought was lunch (noon on a Sunday) but apparently it was brunch.  Unfortunately, I am not a fan of eggs and I was not enthusiastic about of all of the breakfast burrito, breakfast sandwich, East Coast Breakfast, etc. type choices.  Luckily, there were quite a few sandwich and burger options for non-egg eaters like myself.    $14.99 is not exactly cheap for a burger, but in a very pricey city, it seemed moderate.  More importantly, the food and service were solid.  They even served complimentary mini-donuts. Each plate that came out was a feast for the eyes.  For those who want to start their day off right, for $7 more you can get unlimited champagne.

Even at 7 cents an ounce more than what I'm used to paying at my neighborhood Yogurtland, this particular location in Scottsdale made me so happy.  Believe it or not, one of the reasons I chose to stay at the Firesky Resort for my mini-vacation was due to its proximity to Yogurtland - Only 0.3 miles!  Anyway, I had a lot of not-so-great food experiences in Scottsdale but Yogurtland made it all better.  This location has surprisingly fresh toppings.  I hate it when raspberries are mashed up, cheesecake pieces are stuck together, and yogurt chips are mixed with white chocolate chips.  Not the case here. This location is immaculate and very organized.  If Yogurtland were a man, I'd marry him.

To celebrate the end of a long work day (week), we headed over to Epicentre to grab drinks. We surveyed our options and were drawn to Enso by its outdoor seating. To beat the heat of summer, we ordered a round of Imperial Mules for all. I am a huge fan of Moscow Mules and this version was to my liking.  Although the outdoor seating area was beautiful, we quickly realized that there was no air circulation and it was extremely hot.  The hostess was very flexible with us and let us move to a bar-height table inside instead. I'm not sure I would eat at Enso but the drinks were great and the ambiance felt classy.

We had just arrived in Charlotte and it was late at night. We were looking for a place with 1) TVs to watch the unfortunate game on Sunday night and 2) good food.  Dandelion Market was perfect for what we needed. The waitress misled us a little bit and told us to order 2-3 items per person. We definitely ended up with too much food. Here are some of the items we sampled:  -Mediterranean Trio -Prosciutto Crostini -Pan Seared Scallops -Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops -Grilled Chicken Wings -Market Mac & Cheese -Pomme Frites -Dando Brussel Sprouts -Grilled Steak Sliders -PEI Mussels -Beet Salad  Overall, everything was good. The Prosciutto Crostini was the weakest link. We really loved the fries. We were beyond stuffed (5 of us total) and had some leftovers. If you go, I would recommend that you order at most 2 items per person to start.

SLOWEST FRONT DESK EMPLOYEES EVER!  This hotel has a loooooooong front desk area with over a dozen stations but they only have 2-3 employees working at any given time. Even if there are only 2 people in front of you in line, it will take 15 minutes to get to the front. It's so annoying.   CHEAP KEY CARDS THAT GET DEMAGNETIZED EVERY DAY  The elevator is super-slow. It seemed like every time I finally went up the elevator to my room, my key was demagnetized and I had to go back down to reception to get it fixed. And since I already explained how slow the employees are, you can imagine what a big hassle that was.   LOW WATER PRESSURE  The rainfall shower-head is nice but there's not enough water pressure. It reminded me of hotels in China.   TERRIBLE SHAMPOO BOTTLE DESIGN  I know, this is a minor complaint. The shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and lotion come in a tall skinny plastic bottle with a tops that "click" into place. I couldn't even open the conditioner so my hair went unconditioned for two days (gasp!). I was able to get the lotion bottle open but when I put it down on the counter without the top, lotion splattered everywhere. It looked disgusting.   PHONE CALLS COST $13.55 EACH  My friend has AT&T, which has no signal inside the hotel. We were meeting up with another friend (also a paying customer of the hotel) and we had to call him using the land line. It cost $13.55 PER CALL and she made 2 calls, each lasting about 60 seconds. When we checked out, the girl at the front desk said that "someone told you the cost of the calls when you checked in." Um, NO! I checked in and no one said anything to me.   NO ROOMS WITH 2 BEDS  I was staying in a room with my friend (another girl) and it would've been convenient to have a room with 2 beds. But nope, all rooms at PH Towers have 1 bed and 1 pullout couch. With the pullout couch open, I could barely walk around the tiny room.   ROOMS UNPREPARED  Since we were utilizing the pullout couch, we needed sheets for the couch. Housekeeping said that it should've been in our closet but there were no sheets to be found. When I wanted to watch TV, I realized that the room didn't have a remote. I had accidentally left my toothbrush at home and I asked them to bring a toothbrush but apparently, the hotel doesn't have toothbrushes?!?!   I know, I complain a lot. But the good thing to say is that my friend bid on Priceline and got the room for $100 per night.

Am I a food snob?  I don't think so but I suppose that could be one explanation for my dissatisfaction.  There's no good way to put it - the food on this tour (or the food in Scottsdale for that matter) is just not up to the level that we're used to in LA.  I was VERY excited for this tour.  I've been on 2 other food tours (1 in LA and 1 in Seattle) and both were fabulous experiences.  In terms of the tour guide, I don't think Annie lacks any enthusiasm or friendliness compared to the other tours I've been on.  In fact, one of my friends hurt her back and was having a hard time walking and Annie was well-prepared and had a wheelchair in her car that she let us use.  She was one of the nicest people we met during our 4 day trip to Scottsdale.  That said, the food was so disappointing.  The first stop was the Rusty Spur, where we were each given one slider.  The bun was cold and the patty tasted like it had just come out of the freezer.  At that point, I was still optimistic because who expects good food from a saloon anyway?  Our second stop was Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars.  It was cute little shop and my friend ended up buying some stuff from there.  The third stop was Su Vino Winery.  Obviously, I didn't expect amazing wine in Scottsdale but their best seller, Summer Rain, was not good.  It was some sort of white wine that is far too sweet for normal consumption.  The next stop was Frank and Lupe's Mexican food where we were each given a stuffed sopaipilla.  It reminded me of the tacos you get at camp.  The sopaipilla itself was cold and the filling was bland unless you put a ton of chiles on it.  The fifth stop was Cowboy Ciao, which was the only stop where we ate something that actually tasted really good.  I'm not sure what the item was called but it's some sort of polenta topped with pulled pork, cranberries, and other goodies.  I wish there was more.  We then made our final stop at the Sugar Bowl, where we each ate an ice cream cream puff. The pastry tasted really stale and it was hard to chew.  Beside the quality of food, there are a few other issues I had with the tour.  1) There wasn't enough food.  If you think about it, we had 3 food stops, and 1 dessert stop.  We ate nothing at Su Vino and Outrageous Oils and Vinegar.  Each portion at a food stop was roughly the size of one street taco (you know, the ones you get from food trucks).  I can eat 4 of those any day and I'm a girl.  Now imagine eating what's equivalent to 3 of them but over a 3 hour period. You get the idea. 2) The sequence needs to be reshuffled.  Since I was on the Sunday tour, we met up at noon.  That means we didn't have our first slider until after 12:30pm.  Then for the next hour, we ate NOTHING. The next food stop was stop #4, which was after 1:30pm.  I was starving by this point and not in a very good mood. 3) The other food tours I've been on have been very good about keeping the tour separate from "shopping."  Annie said at the very beginning that participants on the tour are free to order drinks if they desired and that she has seen people turn the food tour into a bar crawl.  Um, I don't want to hang out with drunk people and I really don't want to wait for people to order their drink and sip it slowly while the rest of us are ready to leave.  Again, the samples were the size of a street taco so you can imagine how quickly one could devour the food.  Some people shopped at Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars during the tour and held us back.  They really should have waited until after the tour ended to go back. 4) Annie made some recommendations for other restaurants as we were walking.  She completely lost credibility with me when she said that Malee's Thai on Main is a "great" Thai place. OMG, I think it may have been the worst and most overpriced Thai food I've ever eaten.  We had gone to Malee's the day before the tour and the Tom Kha Gai soup was thick and way too sweet and the Duck Curry tasted terrible.  I guess the Thai food standard in Scottsdale is not very high.  There are 2 different routes for this tour and I can only hope that the other route offers a superior experience.

My company recently worked with the Hilton to host a multi-day conference for over 100 of our summer interns. This is the second time we've held the event here and I have to say I am very pleased with the hotel in general.  No, this is not the fanciest or newest hotel. You can certainly see the age. However, it is centrally located, the staff is very polite, and the hotel is clean. We arranged a pre-con meeting with the hotel and they brought in about 10 department heads to meet with our team. They were very respectful and made us feel valued.  We reserved the majority of the meeting rooms and held buffet meals in the ballrooms. All of the setups were on time and the meals were delicious. Most of our interns stayed at the hotel as well. The hotel staff was always available to accommodate any of our requests.  I was in a corner room with an excellent view on the 21st floor and had access to the executive lounge on the 22nd floor. We ate breakfast in the lounge a few times and the only thing is I wish they would allow me to heat up pastries (croissants taste much better warm).

The pho saved me what could have been a very unpleasant car ride home. The coolest thing about this place is that the older lady owner is walking entertainment.  She has music on her and every time she passed the table, I got a quick glimpse into her musical preferences.  The uncoolest thing is that a certain customer doesn't know how to properly lock the door when sitting on the toilet.  Alright, onto the food.  I don't think I've ever enjoyed pho broth that much before. But don't misunderstand; I'm not saying that this place has the most amazing pho broth. I'm just saying that it tasted really amazing to me. Canned Sprite was amazing to me that day as well; almost as amazing as how Christopher Columbus must have felt when he "discovered" America.

Even if you have a car, let Green Zebra pick you up from your hotel.  On the way there, I was a bit restless that the ride took so long but on the way back, I was glad that I didn't get my dirty self into our own car.  Trust me, you will get very dirty.  There were 3 of us in the Tomcar and it cost $129+tax for the first 2 people and $59+tax for the 3rd person.  There are 3 switching points so you can have 4 drivers total.  With our huge goggles and bandanas covering the bottom half of our faces, we looked like a group of bank robbers. The 3rd leg is the most fun to drive and of course, I was the one who drove that section.  I am an aggressive driver and the guide car didn't drive fast enough for my aggressive personality.  However, it was probably for the better since we should always put safety first.

BEST BUFFET EVER!   There are a lot of buffets in Vegas that serve excellent "buffet food." But Wicked Spoon serves good food, period. They have the type of food that you would enjoy at a nice, sit-down restaurant.   We went for brunch and I opted for the $35 version with bottomless mimosas. We were all drunk by 1pm so that was a plus.   The great thing about the food at Wicked Spoon is that a lot of options separated into individual serving sizes in cute little containers. The eggs Benedict, short rib pasta, risotto, fried chicken, Korean short ribs, prime rib and pork belly wrapped in bun all tasted really great. There were so many things to try that I was worried that I wouldn't be able to try everything before I got full.   The dessert selection was beautiful. But by the time I got to dessert, I was already stuffed.  It was such a successful meal. We all had a fantastic time. And you should go too.

My parents, the bf, and I went to Montreal for the first time together. We wanted to see the city in a unique way. My stepdad suggested a Segway tour but I've been on so many Segway tours (yes, I'm a nerd) and I wanted to change it up. Electric scooter looked fun. The price of the scooter tour is the same as bicycle tours in the city so why not save some energy on peddling? We booked a private tour for the 4 of us and met our guide, Carrie, at the shop. We were each assigned a scooter and taught how to ride it. According to Dyad's website, "Riding a Scooter is as easy as 1,2 3." Well, not quite. My mom could not figure it out and I was nervous the whole time. Furthermore, the tour led us along very busy streets in Montreal and a lady almost wiped out my stepdad when she opened her car door unexpectedly.   Other than that, the tour was fantastic. We went up Mont Royal and explored all around Jean Talon Market. Since we booked a private tour, we were able to customize the tour to focus more on food, yummy! I would highly recommend the Dyad tour (just be careful).

I haven't had khao soi in a while and although Thai Basil's version is not the best I've ever had, it was solid and I was glad to find it on the lunch specials.  I went to Thai Basil with a few coworkers during training and we had a very limited lunch hour. Thai Basil was a fast option that satisfied the entire party.

We were debating between the Mob Attraction and the shark reef and settled on this since it's much more unique.  Even $25 per person is pretty pricey but money is no object in Vegas.  We parked at the Tropicana parking lot and tried not to stare at the blindingly white walls of the hotel on our way in.  The Mob Attraction is located in an obscure corner of the property and I really think the Tropicana should move it somewhere more prominent.  Anyway, we didn't really know what to expect but it was more straightforward than I thought it was going to be. Just follow the directions and you'll be fine.  The actors at the beginning were cool and the holograms were interesting as well. The guy behind us in line looked like Sherlock Holmes and for a while, we couldn't tell if he was part of the attraction or if he was a tourist.  Towards the end, there was a "museum" portion that introduced the various mobsters who controlled Vegas.  We didn't buy the funny looking photos but I had a great time. It's something different and worthwhile to do in Vegas.

Is this the best sushi I've ever had? No, but omakase for $35 is a great deal! There was nothing exotic but there was 6 pieces of tuna sashimi, 3 pieces of seared tuna, 3 pieces of seared salmon belly, 2 pieces of tuna nigiri, 2 pieces of salmon nigiri, 2 pieces of spicy tuna nigiri, and some other goodies I devoured so quickly that only my tummy remembers.  The service was fast and the fish was fresh. It was a great value! I would've loved to try one of the cool rolls; maybe next time.

Why isn't there a Topgolf near where I live? This place is incredible! We arrived at 11:30 on Sunday morning and there was already a 45 minute wait. We sipped drinks at the bar while waiting for a bay to over up.  We were set up at one of the lower level bays. We paid $35 for one hour of "golf" and ordered additional food and drinks with our server. We played a simple game where we could earn points by hitting any of the targets. I like the automated ball dispenser. Wave a club and like magic, a ball comes out!  Since we had a tight timeline, we had to leave after just one hour. I would've loved to stay longer or to come at night.

What a cool (cheap) date place! The guy helping us out was super nice and explained everything to us. We were given glow stick bracelets before playing. The ambiance would be perfect for rave too!   Anyway, the holes are pretty fun and there's a cute bench/charger at every other hole. We went during the middle of the day so there was no wait.  We were in a bit of a rush and it took us about 30 minutes to complete the entire course. At a regular pace, it would've been 45-60 minutes. You can also sign up for a loyalty program to earn free games.
