Huge breakfast Burrito!  7.64 but well worth it. Added cheese, bacon & potatoes to my sausage and egg!!  This hit the spot!  Already been there twice in the last 3 days!!!  They were also wearing gloves which is always a plus!  Very friendly staff!  Same girl helped me both times!  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!

Awesome gym..best la fitness i have been to...they really remodeled it nice with all new cardio machines in the old la fitness & added onto it with free weights and more by adding additional sq ft..it you came here before..u really need to check it out now..much much nicer.  Only wish they were open past 8 on saturdays and sundays..they close at 10 on fridays which isnt so bad..and 12 on the other days.

Great prices on fruits and veggies...good coffee..decent sandwiches..would be better if they put more meat and charged you a extra dollar or so..because IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE EATING JUST BREAD!  The toppings are very fresh though!

We have been here over a dozen times and its usually pretty good.  We love their salads & pasta dishes!  Everything is humongous and I can eat!    We went there yesterday & we shared 2 items!  We had a large BBQ Chicken Salad (14.50) & a lunch portion Louisiana Chicken Pasta (10.95) My wife just started a diet so didn't want to eat much carbs(pasta) so I devoured most of that dish as well as half of the huge salad.  Maybe that's why I weigh like 5 pounds more today!  haha  Another good salad is Santa Fe Salad..but we were hesitant to order it because the cook didn't make it awesome like we had it the 1st time! Other great dishes are Orange Chicken & Chicken Avocado club is good with their fries & must ask for their ranch!

It's been awhile since I picked up food from here!  I miss there Cabeza Tortas!!!   They are tender and full of flavor especially with their sauces!!  We used to pick up food from here all the time when I worked in Tempe!!!   I miss it!!!

I went here with my wife and I was very anxious to try this since I had heard it was better than Culvers...I thought it was okay...I got a Triple Burger and still thought it was too small...the frys were okay...personally too thin for me.  I don't know..maybe I was comparing it too much too Culvers....Culvers was better because it filled me up...had more flavor and it was more greasy.  So, in conclusion...I liked Culver's more but Freddy's is healthier.

We met the owner, Shes such a nice lady! She gave us outstanding service! She went out of her way on providing us with the best service and delivery. She is customizing our cake for our baby shower, it looks like something you would see on Cake Boss... Her bakery is super clean, staff is very friendly and the cake tastes awesome! Thanks Sweets unlimited!

You turned off my utilities by accident at my current resident when you were supposed to turn off utilities at a different address I informed you off..then it takes you 12 hrs to turn it back on..while my wife and 4 month old baby have no electricity  and all the food has gone bad..no way of getting a hold of her while I am at work cuz her phone won't charge.

I get my haircut here once a week and it's always great..my barber's name is Al and he is awesome but all of the barbers are really good here.  You can even get a razor shave or a shoe shine while you are here.  Recommend scheduling an appointment because it can get pretty busy sometimes except on Saturdays because they don't do appointments on that day..1st come 1st serve.  Go check it out..you want be disappointed!

Mojo's was my favorite till I tried Menchies..much better flavors like Chocolate Covered Banana and even Pumpkin (awesome) for their seasonal!  Lots of flavor, very rich, clean & priced at about what they charge at mojos..maybe a little more but Im not sure!

Awesome burger..great prices..delicious concrete mixers and custard with different flavors every day..Actually met the owner at my barber shop and he was very nice and gave me free coupon for custard after I told him that I love his place & it was better than Freddys!

Meat was very salty & was poor quality..was excited to try it but very disappointed.  I went with my wife and friend and we all love subs and have tried many and we all felt that it was ok!  The bread wasn't that great either..It seems like the other locations have better reviews but nonetheless, its still the same meats and bread.  I would rather go to Jimmy Johns, Jersey Mikes or Hangover Hoagies.

I feel like this place deserves 2 stars  and my wife feels like it doesn't deserve any stars...we split steak calamari..I thought it was okay and my wife didn't care for it at all..the sauce was decent.  For entree, I ordered carne asada burrito and it barely had any steak OR FLAVOR and my wife ordered street tacos and she only had a couple bites...I later found out that she didnt eat it because the meat was raw/red..I am a real fast eater and usually not that picky so at this point my food was 80 percent done because I was so hungry and didnt care at this point. When she pointed out that the meat was raw..I observed my dish and noticed it was raw as well..the server knew that my wife didnt care for the food and he didnt do anything about it..he was really nice though but oh well..I am kinda buzzing right now while writing this review because we had drinks at Narcise afterwords..I should have known not to go to SOL because my wife's boss mentioned it was ehhh !  The food was missing seasoning...no flavor!  Later, we went to Menchie's for yogurt and the owner told us that someone she knew got sick from there..we are not sick yet..we will keep our fingers crossed......our bill was 51.09 and I still gave the water 10.00 tip..I feel like its not his fault!

Best barbershop in town!!!  I drive all the way from Deer Valley & 40th St to get my fade on!!!  All of the barbers are talented and all great at what they do!!!  They have many flat screens to catch the sports and highlights!!!  I recommend getting a shave and haircut to get really pampered!  Sit back and enjoy a beer and get the best haircut or shave you've ever had!!!
