I went here cause they have some seriously amazing brownies. Like, I'll mug a senior citizen if I knew they were carrying one of the brownies from Hot Bagels.... Anyway, I decided to go for their buffalo chicken sandwich on a plain bagel. Not too bad. I mean, it's kinda hard to mess up a deli sandwich, am I right? They have a lot of choices and the price is right too. $5.95 for a cold sandwich ($6.95 for a hot) which includes chips and a drink. Yeah, move over Subway...lol My friend and I also tried their bagel dog...that's really yummy too. I'll be back to try other things along with buying out their supply of brownies.  Oh, and the reason why I only gave 4/5 stars is because it was kinda loud in there and had to have the girl who was taking my order repeat herself at least 3 times. It's wasn't cause of loud music or anything, it's just cause there was a lot of people dining in and the seating area, although good enough, is still kinda on the small side. I think I may have seen a table or two outside too but they were empty as its was hotter than the surface of the sun outside...lol.

I was at the Fujiya Market (which is next door) and saw this place and decided to stop in. The place smells amazing! We got the strawberry cake and a flan. The flan was my absolute favorite. It's not like the traditional mexican flan you are thinking of. They take a smaller version of that and stick it on top of what seems to be a few layers of custard and soft pound cake. They then top it off with fresh strawberries, blueberries and kiwi along with a few dollops of whip cream. It's seriously to die for!! The staff was nice and helpful too...very patient while we tried to figure out what to get!! I'll be coming back here for sure!!

Quite a far drive for me, but worth the trip! The onigiri here is amazing! They have a selection of interesting items but when I went it seemed that the shelves were quite empty in the dry grocery section. There was a lot of stuff in the refrigerated section, especially in the drink cooler. I didn't get to try them, but the bento boxes looked amazing. They have a cute little dining area where you can heat up anything you buy and sit down and eat it. The staff was very helpful and nice! They told us about getting free onigiri by simply liking them and checking in on Facebook! I'll definitely be coming back for more!!

I'm not trying to defend this store or anything cause it is ghetto but I mean it's not always the store's/employee's fault. I mean, look at the neighborhood it's in...look at the people who shop at this specific Kmart...the answer is in itself right there. People let their kids run amuck pulling things off shelves, ruining things, not putting things back where they found them, damaging product and not paying for it...people are the REASON the store looks so sh!tty in the first place! So really ask yourself...are you SURE the store is ghetto...or is it just the PEOPLE??? Hmmm??????

I don't really understand what the big deal is with this place. It's not as great as everyone makes it seem. I'm just not a fan. The food isn't as flavorful as BBQ should be. I don't know if it's just because I have high expectations because I've had some amazing BBQ from back east...or what the deal is. This place just doesn't do it for me. And I've even given it about 3 chances and each time I wasn't impressed. Sorry Dave :( :(

Super pissed about the way this location handled the Pacquaio/Bradley fight!  I received an email stating that the fight would be shown here. It was even listed with the info you could pull up on google... We always go to this location for the PPV boxing matches and each person that goes usually runs up a bill of no less than $80. And every time we've gone, the downstairs bar is always full of people there for the fight. This time around we show up and put in our drink order then ask when they were going to be putting the fight on. The bartender went and asked her manager who then told her they were paid by someone to NOT show the fight anywhere in the Dave and Busters EXCEPT this upstairs room that this "unnamed" person paid to rent out. It completely blows my mind that Dave and Busters would even allow something as selfish as this to happen. So because someone wants to be a greedy stuck up d!ckhead and ruin things for other people, Dave and Busters is just going to accept the money and not allow others to watch the fight and have a good time.  Needless to say, a company like that isn't worth my continued patronage and we won't be returning for anything.

I unfortunately have to update my review to one star. I came in today with a co-worker for lunch. Nothing was wrong with the food but there was an incident.  One of the waiters spilled broth all down my back. The waiter knew what he did and said "Oh"...but didn't bother to say a word to me. I only noticed what he had done after I felt the broth soaking into my clothes.  I grabbed napkins and started to clean off my clothes and nothing was still said to me. It was only when I went to ask for my check, a guy by the name of Andy simply said "sorry about that." I asked what I was supposed to do if my clothes ended up with oil stains. He said "It was only broth. It's not going to stain. It's not like it was red wine or anything...And it was really only a few drops..." So I told him, "No, there is oil...so it CAN stain! and NO, It wasn't a few drops. My entire back is wet." Again, his response..."Oh, well sorry." I'm beyond furious and it blows my mind that if I hadn't said anything, they wouldn't have even cared!! Rest assured, they will be getting the dry cleaning bill if these spots don't come out!!

I've come here multiple times and each and every time I HAVE to get the alligator. I love almost everything on the menu. It's all worth trying. Just watch the deep fried platters...there is such a thing as too much deep fried food on one plate. It can tend to get a bit overwhelming. I think my only complaint is that the service always kinda seems a little slow and the prices are a bit much. I mean, I understand that seafood prices can be a bit much but they seem to seriously jack up the prices at this place. I love the little dessert tray they have to show you what they have on the dessert menu that night. I'm a visual type of person and it's just so helpful. They're desserts are really good too so if you can manage to leave room for them, I suggest you try something.

HOLY CRAP...where do I begin with this horrible visit?? First, we walked in...a few people were sitting at tables and a few at the bar...there was NO ONE to be found anywhere as far as Takamatsu's employees go. We must have stood at the door waiting to be seated for at least 10 minutes before someone came out of nowhere to seat us.  As far as we saw, there was only ONE waitress.  She sat us and finally came back another 10 minutes later to get our drink order. It took her a little over 5 minutes to bring back 3 waters...she must have had to go out back and pump them out of the wells. That's the only explanation as to why it would take that long.  Another 20 minutes went by before she came back to take our food order. We ordered 2 orders of gyoza, 2 hot stone bowls and a chicken yakiudon bowl for my 3 year old daughter.  The food took 30 minutes to come out and when it did come out they never brought my daughters yakiudon bowl. After about 15 minutes of eating we realized that her bowl wasn't coming out. There was, again, no sign of the waitress anywhere so I had to wait to look for her and then finally flag her down. I asked her where my daughter's food was and if it was even ordered. She just looked at me completely confused. She claimed that yes she put in the order and that it was "coming out soon". I saw her run back to the kitchen...most likely because she lied and never put in her order in the first place. I don't understand how someone can assume they're not going to order food for their child and let them sit there and go hungry. My friend and I were finally done with our food another 15-20 minutes later and my daughters food had yet to come out. I had to yet again flag down the non existent waitress and told her we just wanted our check. When she did manage to bring the check she said "your daughters food is done." I let her know not only did I not care but we didn't want it. And I didn't pay for it.  We paid the bill and as we were walking out, as if perfect timing by my daughter, my daughter asked out loud "mommy, where is my food? Where are we going?" And I made sure to loudly mention exactly where we were going...somewhere else so I can get her some food finally.  Such a sad excuse for a restaurant. And the food wasn't good at all either. We won't be back and I can only hope you don't waste your time and money there either.

Took the baby daddy here for Father's Day. I highly recommend booking your table online through their website. It made it so much easier! We walked right in and they immediately sat us.   The food was amazing. They have a salad type bar where you can get everything from fresh and saut√©ed veggies to candied bacon. The best part was all the delicious meat you can eat which is cooked to your liking. Even my 4 year old said she loved the food.   I took off one star for 2 reasons... 1) They have a system which incorporates "drink coaster" like cardboard circles in which one side is green (to tell them keep the meat coming) and one side is red (to tell them you don't need food at the moment). Even while our coasters were flipped to green, they would still pass our table. There seemed to be a single corner of the restaurant in which they were focusing on, leaving others to sit and wait until they eventually decided they wanted to come our way. 2) Their alcoholic drinks are WAY overpriced for what they are. I ordered a drink that was MAYBE 4 ounces (most of which seemed to be ice) and they charged me $14 for it. The drink was just ok. Definitely not worth the $14 for sure.   Other than that, I'd return again for any other special occasion.

Got the wings here...plain and simple...they're awful. Barely any meat, very dry, no flavor. Won't be back...  **UPDATE** The (I assume) owner of this "fine" establishment decided to email me about my review on their wings...the following is the correspondence between myself and "Meridith". If this is how they treat their customers, I seriously don't understand how they've managed to stay open for a so called "40 years"...  Message from Meridith: "Wings were sauced like they always are. If you read the menu you could have gotten the wings sloppy. Our wings are the same size as every where else in the valley. Try our pizza next time. We've been in business for 40+ years. We must be doing something right. You can try Papa Johns."  Response message from me: "Don't be angry cause you have horrible wings...not everyone can get them right so don't feel bad. I can't say anything about your pizza cause I've never had it but even so I doubt I'd go back just to try it... Sure...your wings are the same size as everyone else's in the valley...as far as the bone goes. But it's the AMOUNT of meat on the bone which counts. And that right there is where your wings are TRUELY inferior. Your wings were purchased to feed a party of people during a boxing match on PPV and every single person at the party who ate the wings all said they were horrible...so for your sake I hope that we just got a bad batch or something cause none of those people there said they would ever go to your restaurant for wings. It was very immature and unprofessional to message me and talk to me in such a way about the issue when instead you should be more focused on trying to find out what the issue was and fixing it. I will be doing a follow up to my review to show everyone how you treat your customers over a matter of simply having their own opinion about your food if it just so happens to be a negative opinion."  Sounds like a serious lack of customer service skills on their part. Looks like I'll be getting my wings from Papa Johns from now on...*sigh* what a serious tragedy....lol!

I was the D.D. and they kicked me out for "being too intoxicated"?!?!?!? THE F*CK, YOU SAY?!?! Do I look like Jesus? Do you think I turned water into wine???? A box of rocks has a higher IQ than the people working here.  I don't recommend coming here, but if it's filth, watered down drinks, thieving bouncers, and stolen credit card info is what you're into...then HEY! COME ON DOWN.  Not really. That was a joke. Please don't go there. You'll be battling with your credit card company forever cause your card was cloned behind the bar and then used for a shopping spree multiple places in the valley.

Used to come here for lunch every once in a while but now I WILL NEVER be coming back!  I ordered the pho with the beef and extra noodle. My friend just ordered the beef and meatball pho as is.  They ended up putting the extra noodles in my friend's pho so when I asked the waitress if she could fix it, you know what she said?!? Are you ready for this?!?!  She said, and I QUOTE "Maybe your friend can share noodle with you..."  Are you F**KING kidding me lady?!?! Really????  I was DONE after that. Never going back. I'm still shocked she even said that to us........

I put my last review in the wrong spot...so here we go again...  Not gonna come back to this place any time soon...  Came here for an event that my work was having. The salon had to call in 10 nail techs to be there and they also closed the salon down for us from 11:30 to 1:00...that's actually the only reason that they even get one star...  They claimed that they were going to give us discounted prices on the pedicures since we were having a team event there. They were going to charge $13 for a manicure and $23 for a spa pedicure...I'd hate to see the "normal" prices if that was the case.  My friend and I opted for just the pedicure and went and sat down. I noticed she had stuff floating in her water and I had some black hair floating in mine. I'm very blonde so I knew it wasn't my hair. The nail tech guy fished it out.  My nail tech wasn't that bad. He asked my friend and I if we wanted to add on callus (spelling?) remover and a 20 minute massage for an extra $15 so we got the 2 extras. Well, my friend's nail tech started to go in and attempt to trim her toe nails. My friend stopped her and asked her to please just file them...She repeated herself TWICE not to cut her nails. Next thing she knew...SNIP! She had cut off her toe nail and cut it extremely short to the skin which caused a bit of pain and bleeding for my friend. Then the nail tech doesn't even bother to cut the other toe nail on the other foot to make the toes look even!!  Anyway, they did the sugar scrub real fast and then they started in on the massage which only lasted about 8 to 10 minutes...no where NEAR the 20 minutes that they promised. My tech seemed to be doing stuff to my feet that my friend's tech didn't do to her's...and vice-versa. It was very inconsistent and seemed very weird. It led us to believe that they weren't the normal nail tech's that work there and were probably just some of the "extras" they brought in to accocommodate the large group that we had. Or were they even licensed to do nails at all?? It didn't seem like it...  To top it all off, my friend's nail tech did one coat of polish, stood up and told her that the other nail tech (the one painting my nails) would finish painting. We don't know why she didn't just finish her feet because the nail tech just walked away and didn't even start working on anyone else. She just went and stood elsewhere.  So in the end, my friend and I were out $38 for a horribly done and horribly short pedicure that we could have done ourselves at home for a fraction of the cost...VERY upsetting...

If you have any decision on where you get your medical imaging done, I'd advise you to choose ANYTHING but Simon Med.  I had a 5:30 appointment time (5:00 check in) during the week. I should mention that I did call the morning of my appointment to confirm it and it was confirmed. I get there at 5pm to check in...there was a patient in front of me who had seemed to have been waiting there a while. I stood in line for at least another 10 minutes while the guy behind the counter was figuring out God knows what. When it was finally my turn, I was told there was no appointment for me in the system. EXCUSE ME? What?? I explained I called to confirm that morning and it was confirmed. Apparently, the idiot on the other end of the phone cancelled my appointment. So the guy behind the counter calls his manager down and when she finally comes down, I continuously tell her that I confirmed the appointment this morning and that it's not my problems the girl in scheduling is incompetent and hit a cancel button. I explained that I was unable to reschedule as I was already missing a meeting at work to be there and I can't take off work anymore. She asked if I could come in on the weekend but I also was unable to reschedule my plans. They kept trying to push out an appointment further and further but I refused, telling them it was important my doctor get these results as soon as possible. So the manager gets mad at me and tells me she'll go ask the tech if he is willing to squeeze me in and then tells me even if he can, my wait will be 2-3 hours or more (the waiting room was empty so wtf she was talking about...I have no idea). She comes back up and huffs a little and says "The tech said he'll get you in but again, you'll be waiting as least 2 hours...". Fine. So I go back up to the guy at the check in counter, he hands me the forms and I fill them out and hand them back...he then asks for $995!! Oh, hell no. I told him that arrangements were already made to pay only $200 for the test and that was all I was going to pay. So he then argues with me and keeps trying to get me to pay "payments" on the $995. I refused and told him I was ONLY paying $200. So he calls the finance department only to confirm (10 minutes later) that I was RIGHT and that they "forgot" to upload the paperwork showing I was only to pay $200. I pay the money and sit down to wait. A whole 5 minutes go by and I was called back by the tech. So 2-3 hours or more, huh?? Yeah right. I feel like she said that to try to deter me from waiting.  The whole place just had a "dirty" feel to it. The changing room had a large laundry basket overflowing with used gowns. And the blood draw/IV room had an open sharps box on the floor with NO cover, used gloves sitting on top, and blood squirting up the wall (see photo). I was so grossed out. There was even blood on the outside package of the unused alcohol swab that he used to clean my arm with. How does that even happen?!?! TL;DR - Rest assured I will NEVER be returning to Simon Med. Scheduling is incompetent, finance is incompetent, management is rude, check in is slow, place is FILTHY.

Outside of Japan, this is some amazing ramen. The price isn't too bad either. The portions are huge. I can't ever finish an entire bowl. Also in the same building is a nice little tea and boba (spelling?) bar. It's all really yummy! You won't be dissapointed!

I had to update this review and the reason I lowered the rating of it isn't due to the food, quality of food or anything like that. They lose 2 stars on the simple fact that for the past 5 times I've been there they f*** my order up. And what the f*** up isn't even a huge deal so I just can't wrap my head around why it keeps happening.   I always order the Sapporo ramen. It's SUPPOSED TO come with butter and corn in it already. And then I just add all the extras to it. It's there, on the menu, clear as day that the Sapporo ramen SPECIFICALLY comes with butter and corn. So when I place my order I ask for the Sapporo ramen, add egg and naruto. EACH AND EVERY time I get my order and all the extras I asked for are in there...but no butter or corn. Who the hell is working back there in the kitchen to get it wrong EVERY...SINGLE...TIME?!?! Not every now and again...but EVERY SINGLE TIME...  I can bet you $50 right now...that I'll walk in there, order it...and it will be wrong. I can 1000% guarantee it will be wrong.  I know what a lot of people are saying..."What's the big deal? Just ask for butter and corn..." Which, yeah sure...I would (actually I have to anyway since they won't give it to me to begin with)... But why should I HAVE to ask for something to be added to a soup that THEY put on the menu saying should already be in there?!?!? What ever happened to quality control??? Or can I safely assume that no one just gives a f***?  Here's an idea...just take it off the menu. You can't seem to get it right away...so save me the trouble of having to get angry about it later and just remove it off the menu.

Meh...I kinda don't understand how this place got such a high review average.  The food is mediocre, at best. It's definitely overpriced for what you get.  The workers there kind of have a "whatever" type attitude.  I know I ordered a sandwich as a combo. I noticed after the fact that with the combo you get your choice of side. She didn't even ask me what I wanted so I walked back up to the counter to tell her which side I wanted. When my food was ready (stupid me) I didn't check it until after I got back to work and saw the side which I was supposed to get wasn't there. So I paid almost $12 for a small drink and a bland sandwich. Awesome. And I wasn't going to go back just for the side. I'll just write if off as a reason to not go back.

This place is an effing joke...especially at night. I can't comment on the food but the bar service and drinks are horrible. First off, if you want a drink, get in line sister...cause you got about a 20 minute wait ahead of you. Their margaritas taste like too much cheap sugary margarita mix and not enough tequila...the beers are served in either hot glasses or tiny plastic cups, and other drinks like whiskey sours are heavy on the sour, barely any whiskey. Wtf? Oh, and I recall ordering a red bull (straight) it was given to me in a tiny cup (redbull is what? 8 ounces maybe?) I didn't even get the full can, but yet handed the guy a $10 and got back like $3...wtf? How does that work? Do yourself a favor, put yourself on their VIP list, get your five free drinks by doing so, then bail and take your drinking money elsewhere...

Although the food is pretty good, I can't get over how slow service is and it makes me wonder if they have the right people working behind the counter.  I stopped in today to get my lunch to go. I figured it would be an in and out type deal. WRONG. I stood in line for about 20 minutes (there was 3 or so people in front of me) while the first guy behind the counter who loads the meat on to the plate seemed to move slower than a sloth. Not to mention that his hair was completely covering his face making it next to impossible for him to see. He kept swinging and flipping all his hair around trying to make it so he could at least see a little something (don't think it helped). I sat there and watched him do it, dreading the fact I'll probably be seeing a hair of his in my food... I feel like he was the hold up for the entire line...everyone else seemed to be a bit quicker. Maybe they need to rethink having that guy there at the front.

So I think the time of closing posted on the front door was 10PM...we arrived at 8PM...that's a kinda normal dinner hour right? Well most of the food was gone, the only thing I saw them refill was the lo mein... Meats tasted burnt and/or overly smoked. Salmon was so dry, it was enough to almost cut the inside of my mouth.  The hot and sour soup was not only lacking in flavor but also smelt like a dirty foot just walking out of the gym. The only thing I really enjoyed was the kimchi. It was the best I've had in a LONG time. The sushi was OK...at least it was cold I guess. Probably around 8:30PM all the staff sat down in the dining room to eat, I mean EVERYONE...cooks, waiters, hosts and hostesses...leaving all the customers to pretty much fend for themselves. We sat for prolly around 10 minutes waiting for our check to be brought to us. For 2 dinners, one soda and one water, it was almost $30!!! Are you kidding me?? Especially when most of the food was gone and so old that it looked shriveled up and nasty???  The kimchi isn't worth coming back to this place...Nothing is worth coming here...

Decided to order from this place on a whim...glad that I did.  The pizza was awesome and so were the fried mushrooms. I heard the wings are pretty good too so I'm sure that will be next on the list to try. The only downfall and the reasons they don't get 5 stars...when I called in my order a girl who answered said she was the ONLY one working so she had 2 orders in front of mine that she also had to deliver and they lived really far away so she quoted me a time of an hour to an hour and a half wait for my food. She eventually got there about an hour or so after I had ordered me food. But, hey, she warned me so it's not like I didn't expect it!

It sucks that I have to give a poor review without even being able to taste the food but this place needs to really take a step back and decide if they want to stay in business or not.  It was Friday afternoon. Around 11:30am. I had called the day before to ask a question and someone answered the phone then so I assumed that the hours THEY CLEARLY LIST ON THEIR WEBSITE AND ON THE FRONT DOOR OF THEIR ESTABLISHMENT are correct. A co-worker and myself were really looking forward to trying this place for 3 reasons...1) I was seriously craving some sweet sticky mango rice which no place else but this place seems to have right now, 2) my co-worker was craving some good Thai food, and 3) the reviews led us to believe we were in for a real treat. I'm sad to report that on that day, I did not fulfil my craving for the sweet sticky mango rice (which I still want, by the way) and my co-worker never got the good Thai food she wanted. Albeit, we got Thai food that day...just not good Thai food.  I drove us 30 minutes during our lunch break to get there. Only to find a hand written note on the door saying they were closed and wouldn't be open until dinner.  WTF?! Ok, here's my take on how you should run a business...if you're gonna try to run a profitable and thriving establishment, don't just "pick and choose" when you feel like being open. Don't understaff your establishment to where you're unable to open during the normal business hours that YOU CHOSE AND POSTED. If there is an actual emergency and you seriously can't open when you're supposed to open, put a note saying so. Not just a note which pretty much describes you possibly just not wanting to open during your normal time cause you don't feel like it.  Or, if you really just can't stick to the opening schedule that, again, YOU CAME UP WITH, then do everyone a favor...remove the times from your door and website and just let people know they need to call ahead before making the drive out to you. Cause trust me, as a PAYING customer, nothing pisses me off more than making a long drive to a restaurant that SAYS on their website and front door they'll be open only to get there and find a lame ass handwritten note saying they're not open for stupid reasons.  Will I ever attempt to return to this place?? I dunno. Depends on how long I hold this grudge against them for making me waste gas and my lunch hour.

I tired to call this place to make sure it was open before going back and the phone number no longer works. From what I understand they're under new ownership. So I took the chance and made the drive out. Thank god they were open.  The food was ok...nothing completely outrageous. They didn't have any mango and sweet rice. I've come to terms that I just won't be able to get any until mangos are back in season :( The staff was nice. I only saw a man and a woman but I assume there was a cook in the back.

I'm giving this 2 stars because I used to come here all the time using tickets purchased off Groupon ($5-$6 for tickets that are normally $10). I was able to see any movie, anytime... Recently, I found out that they've "amended" some of the rules for using tickets purchased off Groupon. The fine print now states that the tickets can ONLY be used Monday-Thursday as long as the movie is showing BEFORE 5PM...anytime after 5PM Mon-Thurs or anytime at all on Friday-Sunday, the tickets are only valued at the face amount you paid for them and you will need to come up with the remainder of the balance to make up the full price of the tickets. So why even have deals on the tickets then? If you're a normal Monday-Friday, 8-5 working individual like most people, the tickets won't even do you any good. Honestly, I feel like if I'm going to go into a movie theater and drop a boat load of money on meals/drinks, etc...I expect to have low ticket prices up front if you're going to charge high amounts for food and drinks. I also took off a star because they always mess up my order. Every. Single. Time.

Best General Tso chicken in the valley!! Hands down! This place used to be called Yie's cafe or something like that and I ate here when it was called that but whoever took it over, I'm glad they did. I mean, don't get me wrong. The food was still good back then but now it just seems to have that something extra.  Another good item is the crab puffs. I like how they're shaped like triangles instead of fried wontons like some places do.  Everytime I come here the place is empty...which I just don't understand cause the food is reasonably priced and seriously amazing! Come eat here people!  You won't regret it!

Update: I went back again at a later time. The place was pretty empty.  Service was slow and kinda bad. I think the person was new and didn't really know what to do.  There was mold on the fruit going around and also the salad was wilted and brown.  Would never be going back....

Be sure to make note that this place is closed on Mondays!! I've been here maybe 3 times to try to give it a fair shot and I don't think I'll be going back again.  The service is super slow and they mix up and confuse orders. Prices seem a bit higher than average also.

There's a reason this place closes down and opens under a new name every 3 months or so.  Good luck trying to be seated when you walk in. There's no one to be found. If and when you do find someone, they're back in the kitchen doing god knows what.  Then when you get seated it takes like 30 minutes to get your drink (even when the restaurant is completely empty). A word to the wise, when they take your drink order, put in your food order because your going to be waiting at least another 30 minutes for that.  Oh, and forget about drink refills here. They're unheard of, just like seeing the waitress again after she delivers your meal. When your done eating and want your check you have to go hunt her down again from the kitchen.  The food isn't horrible but the service is.  If you've got about 3-4 hours to waste, then sure, try this place out....

Came here for an eyebrow wax. Didn't do a very good job. The eyebrows look the same minus just a few hairs. She waxed around the eyebrows and then tweezed a hair or 2 after but that's it. No trimming or anything. Guess I'll keep looking for a good eyebrow waxing place around here.

I'm so upset with this location and more than likely won't be back.  I used to work over by the the location near 20th street and Camelback. Never really had major issues except for the fact that no matter what, my same exact order would always come out to be a different price every single time. But regardless, this review is for the one off Happy Valley.  First, the portions are way smaller than other locations. Today I ordered a large build your own salad. I asked for chicken in it and egg added on. I got MAYBE 5 chunks of chicken the size of my index fingernail and MAYBE 4 slices of skimpy egg. For the prices they up-charge you with, you'd expect a whole lot more than that.  I also asked for cheese as well. Again, they have to keep reminding you that every little thing is an up-charge. Yes...I know, I can read. Well they gave me MAYBE a half TEASPOON of cheese. But I think I'm probably being generous here. Asked for croutons...I got 4 of them...how generous... This is absolutely ridiculous and if I'm gonna pay these outrageous prices, I'm gonna just take my business across the way to Paradise Bakery where I'll at least get more bang for my buck.  Finally, why do I have to tell every single employee who is working what my order is?? Why, then, do you bother to have the first person write it down on the plastic container?! It's annoying especially for people with large orders!!!! Fix your system because it's not a good one right now.  I really like Cafe Zupas but this specific one will never see a dime of my money again.

I've been going to Kristy (owner) since about 2004. She was referred to me by a co-worker who had the most beautiful blonde hair. I've been so many other places to try to get my hair that perfect shade of platinum blonde and no one has been able to do it like Kristy can. And my hair doesn't feel damaged after she does it. I don't know if it's just my hair or if she has some sort of special techinque but whatever it is, it keeps me going back!  I've gone from platinum to black then back to platinum then to red, then back to black and then back to platinum more times than I can count...But no matter how dark I go she can always manage to get me back to that beautiful blonde I love. She also does awesome hair cuts and did my hair for my wedding back in 2006. I'll keep going back as long as she keeps doing hair!!!!

Went to the ER for ongoing medical issues that have been progressively getting worse. I was quick to get a room in the ER but that's only going to count for one of the stars that this place gets.  The other star is for the nurses. They seemed to be nice and genuinely cared.  The doctor I saw was very rude and extremely abrasive. Raising his tone with me to ask me why I was there and made sure to also mention that if I wasn't dying, he's not quite sure why I would even come to the ER. Then he proceeded to tell me that since I was not dying I should probably be seeing my regular doctor. The fact of the matter was that I had already seen my regular doctor who hasn't been able to figure out what was wrong and my symptoms were worsening and I was in a lot of pain. Upon hearing that my primary care doctor hasn't been able to figure out what is going on with me, the ER doctor says "ok and what do you expect from me then? All I'm going to do for you here is give you something for the pain and send you home." This doctor/hospital could care less if they find out why these symptoms are happening and instead just try to mask the pain with drugs and then shove me out the door. So if you find yourself inside the ER of this joke of a hospital, make sure you DON'T have Dr. Mann for a physician and if you do, I'd request someone else...or better yet, find another hospital so you can at least try to get the care you need instead of just drugged up and sent home.

I've made 2 attempts at giving this place a chance.   My first attempt was a few days after their grand opening. I ordered their Alfredo MontAmore dish.  This dish was extremely underwhelming. Very dry. Noodles stuck together. Wasn't even sure I got the right dish at first as there was no Alfredo sauce to be found. Upon seeing very little Alfredo at the bottom of the bowl I figured it was the right order. I ordered the dish with grilled chicken and added shrimp. Both the shrimp and chicken were EXTREMELY dry just like the noodles were  My second visit was just as disappointing as the first. If not more. This time I opted for the Pad Thai. Again, the noodles were so dry that I could stick my fork in them and pull out every single noodle which was stuck together in one large lump. I had a terrible time trying to pull them all apart to make them edible. I got the dish with shrimp and, again, I wasn't surprised to find the shrimp extremely dry. It was supposed to have fried egg in the dish as well but I found maybe 3 or 4 small pieces of egg. Not even anything that would be considered a full egg. They topped it with 2 soggy sprigs of cilantro and a tiny dry shriveled up lime wedge which I was unable to get any lime juice out of in an attempt to moisturize my dry noodles. There was no taste of peanuts...possibly due to the fact they forgot to add them. And there was no taste of sweet chili.   I think it's safe to say I won't be returning and unfortunately, unless this company can really do a complete 180 turnaround and fix all the issues people are complaining about, they won't stand a chance and will be having to close their doors soon...

I don't understand how this place can be open for only a matter of DAYS and it now looks like a completely run down excuse of a grocery store?!? The aisles are small and hard for multiple shoppers to get down.  There is no rhyme or reason to the store layout.  Some of the aisles don't even have signs saying what is down them.  There were flies SWARMING the meat/seafood counters.  The fresh "live" crabs and crawfish were anything but...they were just laying there in the box, none really moving, most of them already dead and stinking to high heaven.  I watched a lady sit there in front of the peanut box located in the produce section grab a handful of peanuts, shell them in her mouth and place the empty shells BACK in the peanut box and dig back in for more peanuts. Maybe she was confusing this place for Texas Roadhouse or even Five Guys where they allow you to eat the peanuts for free.  Over by the milk section, they had a HUGE palette of eggs sitting in the middle of the aisle...not refrigerated what so ever...correct me if I'm wrong, but can't that cause the eggs to go bad? Don't even get me started on the restrooms. No toilet paper, no seat guards, bodily fluids and excrement all over the floors. Honestly, I'd rather take my chances with a portable toilet at a truck stop cause I bet it's cleaner than the toilets here. Prices are also quite higher than average for your every day stuff. For example is everyone familiar with those large bag of Malt-o-Meal cereals you can get anywhere? Well normal prices for those bags are about $5 and some change. Here...they're almost $8.50 or more. Boxed cereal (smaller boxes) of name brand cereal like Frosted Flakes or Lucky Charms will run you $6 or more. All in all I'm just not impressed and feel that they really just hyped up the opening and come to find out, it's all just one big disappointment.
