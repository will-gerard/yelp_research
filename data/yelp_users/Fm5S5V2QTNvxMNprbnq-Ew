They have $5 drinks!  Went for a business networking mixer and they had some food available buffet style for the function.  3 different hummus dips that were great and a really good guacamole too!

One of my biggest pet peeves with restaurants is when they don't expedite properly.... within three minutes of each other, I received my bread and butter, my salad and then my dinner. What's absolutely ridiculous is that the server/bartender all have the same response "Wow, that came out fast" as if it's NEVER happened before.  So, there I was with three plates of food in front of me, not being able to enjoy any single one really. It's almost like they're forcing you to order one single item at a time. I can understand how this might happen when it's busy and they want to get patrons in and out as fast as they can... But, this was a Sunday late afternoon and they were maybe 1/3 full. I'm not in the restaurant industry, so I'm not sure if this is a bartender issue or kitchen issue. Either way, it ruined the visit for me and I won't be back for a while.

Us gals from Campus Flowers went for lunch today and had one of the best Kobe burgers we've had in a while.  They give you your own little worksheet to check off exactly what you want on your burger to make it easy for everyone!  The onion strings were awesome too!

Was feeling the need to be pampered, so I stopped in this place and they took me right away with no waiting.  Great, friendly service and I felt 100% better when I left. Their prices are quite reasonable so I will definitely be back! They did say that Saturdays are their busiest day, so if you want to get right in, go on a week night.

Had never been in Hobby Lobby and decided to give it a try one night. I walked in the door at 7:50 and had 2 cashiers and what looked like a Mgr. yelling at me "We close at 8!!!!!" Instant buzzkill due to the unprofessionalism of these employees. I left and didn't go back for 2 weeks. Sale prices are reasonable, regular prices are ridiculous.

Really enjoyed this restaurant that was referred to me by Mr. Jimmy J.  Love this place and so glad it's close to home.  Had the Pasta Valducci and it was very tasty!  Can't wait to go back!

Stopped to check this place out today and was quite pleased! Simple menu, easy to choose from. Rotisserie chicken with sides, beer and wine. Great location for ASU. Had a really good BBQ chicken sandwich!

Really liked this place!! Great Dirty Martini, perfect meatloaf and the Corn Creme brûlée was to die for!! I will definitely be back and hopefully be able to save room for dessert!! Went on a weekend night and it was busy and loud... I'll probably go back during the week next time.

My new favorite place in Tempe!  This place is unreal such a great vibe and amazing service.  I tried the hummus nachos which I recommend highly!  The salmon was cooked perfectly and the Lemmon fizz craft cocktail was the perfect finishing touch. Great patio as well will be back soon.
