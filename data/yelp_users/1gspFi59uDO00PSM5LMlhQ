This experience is spendy, but isnt everything at the Ballpark. However, the food is very good & diverse. Reservations for a table overlooking the field & awwww: a baseball fan is in heaven.

I had a client's husband pass away so I called for Flower service. This place didnt even survive my inquiry phone call. Rude and immediately got the wrong feeling.

WOW, WOW!!  I am originally from the Pacific Northwest. I know good coffee.  This place is the first I have found in Arizona that knows how to make a Hazelnut mocha that makes me shiver!  The rest of the store is typical as any other coffee shop, so I am rating 4 stars and not 5; because I could really use to find a coffee place that has that unique style and flavor in the decor, location, staff and patrons.

great place, Awesome food, friendly service, bathrooms are clean and the atmosphere is calm (Sun City, hehe). The only bummer is that the kitchen closes from 230 - 5pm.  My favorite flavors are the southern Asian cuisines; Thai, Vietnamese, Muong, & a touch of Indian. This is very good Thai. This is a BIG favorite lunch spot!!

I love this place for Pho. I generally dont order anything else because the food is average. However, the noodle soups, Pho, is awesome.   One must take advantage of the extra ingredients and the sauces to make the soup "snap"! Otherwise, first timers may think the soup is bland.

I totally dig the outdoor bar, sand, puddle and the crew.  Happy hour, misting spray, and mini chimi's too, YUMMY!  The manager can be a tool at times but overall this place is a cool hang. If your over 35, you may want to stay away from Friday nights. However, the special events, UFC, Cinco De Mayo, Etc, are awesome.

This is a great little cafe, filled with Sun City residents & local merchants. Brenda runs the place, its not just a name, and the food it simple & comforting.  Daily specials, standard american cuisine and sweet little lady waitresses.  yummy
