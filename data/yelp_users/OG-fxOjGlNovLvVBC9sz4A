I can't say enough about this place. The coffee is yummy, the servers are personable and you KNOW the owner cares. I'm a fan of their baked goods and lattes but I'm NUTTY about their Jalapeno Pecan Pancakes (as I see other reviewers have mentioned them too). I dream about them :)   Imagine amazingly fluffy pancakes, with a little heat and aftertaste of the jalapenos. They are heavy though - mine will last me for two to 3 breakfasts after I take my doggy bag home.   I traditionally visit in the mornings, but they do have beer tastings and wine tastings at night which tempt me back. The green chile chicken sandwich - also FAB!

We went to celebrate a friend's birthday and it was not an award-winning experience. I'm not a sushi girl, but the rest of the girls said the sushi was "okay" but they've had better.   First, my friend's Saki cup was dirty and she had to request a new one. Then our sushi plates/soy bowls arrived and mine was dirty. When I asked for a new one - there was a pause and she didn't reach for it to take it and replace it - she told me they didn't have that many . . .  seriously? I would take a coffee cup instead if it was clean! She finally took it from me and returned with a clean one hot from the dishwasher.  Overall, we had a good time - the drinks were good - the people-watching didn't fail . . . but I'm not in a hurry to return.   I spoke to another friend who said she had the same dirty plate experience there a year ago - why is it always so crowded?

When I moved to S Scottsdale from Central Phoenix, I was so sad to leave Richardson's and Dick's Hideaway behind in my old hood . . .  until I discovered Carlsbad Tavern.   I love my food with a little bite - it's comfort AND adventure on one plate. And unlike my central favorites, Carlsbad has plenty of tables ready for me to pop in on a whim. More room, yet it still feels cozy.  Outside by the waterfalls with warming heaters - great for a first date OR a night with good friends!

I checked this place out after a bike ride with a friend and really, really enjoyed it! It's casual - order your food first and then they bring it to you. It's a really cute, light, easy place. I described it as the Chipotle of Breakfast.   I had the Sante Fe Eggs Benedict (with jalapeno corn bread - so yummy!) I think my arteries hardened slightly in the midst of digesting but it was worth it. My friend's plate looked equally scrumptious. You're not going to get any fancy coffee there (I was hankering for a latte) but still had a good cup of normal joe.   The staff was nice and pleasant and I really enjoyed the patrons as well - we chatted with quite a few and it just seemed like a really nice upbeat place. If I'm on that end of town again for breakfast - I would definitely go back!

If you haven't researched thermography yet, you've come to the right place to start. Thermography is a radiation-free way to detect cancer and other infections in your body ... early. De Novo Scan will share amazing case studies and visual information before you even get started. It's super interesting and the more you know, the more you'll be sold on ditching mammography for thermography. Tina makes the whole process comfortable and informative. And the remedies and treatments will be as natural as possible.
