We went on the 4 Peaks Adventure this afternoon. It was an awesome time, so glad we went. We met in Fountain Hills and clambered into the Hummer. There are 2 sections - one open air on top and 4 seats in the back. Our guide Robby was excellent. Great job on pointing out the various cactuses, the many amazing features of the hummer, and he didn't sound like he had done it a million times before.   He had a lot of experience with the vehicle, which helped make it pretty comfortable. I was nervous it would be bumpy and painful (since I have RA) and I was absolutely fine. Although there were moments I squeezed my eyes tight shut when he did the thrill part of the ride - going down and up the steep hill ... but at all times I felt perfectly safe.   Beware of the teddy cactus - it blew on my shoe but Robbie & MH got it all off. Scenery beautiful - lake beautiful - you really get a sense of how difficult the land is to traverse and survive in. Good tips on the nutritional value of cactus. You will get dusty and there's no bathroom break for at least 2 hours so be prepared. But it's so worth it.   Water and snacks were provided, and he even offered them to us again at the end for our ride home. Also he took photos of us, and presented each group with a photo tour CD which included the ones he took of us. All made unobtrusively from the car.   He does ATV-ing too. You will have fun, probably even if you don't think so at first! Can't recommend it highly enough - I would go again, esp. on the night tours they also offer. Wish I was here to go when the desert blooms ...

I was so excited to go here after reading all the reviews, but afterwards wondered if I really had the right place or if it was an off day last Sunday. My experience was very different. We went for a late breakfast. It's best if I summarize my plate. The eggs that I ordered over hard had broken and it was hard to even see the yolks, mixed in as they were. The hamburger patty was the driest, least appetizing I've ever had and even the pancakes were heavy, flat without any taste or salt. I thought it would be hard to mess up these basics but you learn something new every day. The service was nothing exceptional.  I thought the place would have some charm, but there was nothing - just an ordinary diner. It's actually kind of sad when you enjoy the toast with jam more than anything else. Never again. It may be cheap but IMO it's misplaced economics to pay anything for something so disappointing.

I went here last sunday and will make this brief since everyone's covered so much of it before. And my opinion seems to be a square peg. Decorated kind of a cross between cute midwestern farmhouse and currently-popular Tuscany theme. That said, I liked the wallpaper where we were sitting and the lighting fixtures.   Not to dwell on the decor but the food simply wasn't that good for me. I was initially interested by the crabmeat Eggs Benedict but when it came it tasted just like fish, not crab and it was short on hollandaise. Overall it was average except in the price - the final bill for 2 breakfasts (even "fancy" ones) and coffee came to about $25, which seems like a lot to pay. Ok, way too much for breakfast. The coffee (unlike a lot of other places) was relatively good and we were seated asap - a plus but I just don't see going back.

nice place, spacious, good decor. Attentive, considerate waitperson. Attractive menu - lots of choices. Complimentary chips (really good) with salsa - all of which are hot - good but spicy. Just FYI. The prices were ok, a bit high - lunch for 2 with one beer, one appetizer, tax & tip = the high side of the $40 range. There was a lot of food, enough for 3-4 more average size meals. We had the shrimp chimi app - ok although I wondered afterwards why - I should have known it would be tiny (probably canned) shrimp. Nice to find on a menu though. MH had the carne asada chimi - flavorful and large. It was ok. As for me, I really didn't like my meal size (ok, who am I kidding - it was HUGE) chicken chimichanga. I'm not an expert of Mexican food by any means but I've had this dish before. There's got to be more to it than putting bite size (not really shredded) white chicken inside - really, that's all there was, no cheese, sour cream, salsa mixed with it - it was incredibly dry. If these are your favorite, ask about this first, imo. Maybe it was just the way I got it, but I wasn't impressed. It left me with a lot of retro-prep work on the leftovers. I might go back, but I doubt it ...

I took takeout so my review will be somewhat limited.   First impression ... you come in and the place looks tired. Not bad, but kind of like "I wish you would go away so I can rest" tired.  Wouldn't want to actually eat there, but for the 10 minutes it took it was ok. Didn't try Mongolian but it looked ok.  Can't beat the takeout. $6.99 (takeout or reinstated price?) for a 3 section styrofoam box that you can fill to your little heart's content. As long as the lid can close comfortably ... there is a sign to this effect.  The buffet was average. I stuck to the appetizer-type stuff and filled it up. Ultimately it was enough for 2 or 3 meals. Not bad for a set price. However, if you're craving quality Chinese, this is not it. Not by a long shot. Good for a day when you're not picky about taste (not bad, mind you) or content.  Takeout also came with a container for soup. The hot and sour did look awesome, with large chunks of tofu, and it was one of the better ones I have tried. Upon request, the attendant also filled a large bag of crispy noodles for me to take along. They did have little cups for sauces, but the hot mustard looked plastic and congealed. Scary to eat, scary to taste so I left it there. And there was no plum sauce to mix it with.    I was surprised that they didn't have a regular menu also, but all buffet, all the time ...   will I go again ? one of life's questions, yet to be answered. And asked ...

went here yesterday for a late breakfast-at-lunch-time, first time and as always based on previous reviews ... so here is my two cents. I was glad there was no wait, which actually surprised me. Clean, cute country decor. I liked the water pitchers on every table. The lemon inside was a nice touch, but have to say that to a ice-water-and-lemon-freak to me, there was too little ice and too little lemon. But I don't like overwhelming people with special requests so I didn't say anything. Although I'm sure it wouldn't have been a problem - everyone was very friendly. The menu was fun to read with lots of options.  Notably, side item substitutions are easy and standard. Ok, on to the food. My husband had an 3 egg omelet, which while it was good, was smaller than we expected and have had elsewhere. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with turkey, which was also just ok - not great. The smoked turkey was incredibly over-salty - I left it on the side. What was wonderful were the pancakes, which gave my ratings the two stars. Unlike anywhere else I've been, you can specify if you want the extra ingredients mixed in or just on top. I did ask without knowing and it paid off! They were truly scrumptious, light, fluffy and delicious. Next time I go, it might be alone but for those pancakes it would be worth it! Also, they offer a card which you can get stamps on with purchase of an entree and some days are double stamps. After 6 stamps you get a free entree. This is awesome! I will be back soon.

my 2nd time there tonight. Pluses: Our server from the first time remembered us - very nice guy. I like the tasting samplers you can get, the free trivia game and the Tue/Thu specials. BTW, there is NO blue cheese in the extra-charge dressing. The food sounds better than it actually is - not bad, just not great. All in all I guess this is damning with faint praise. I like to look forward to restaurants. Lots of tvs and neon beer signs - I get a nagging premonition that loud sports bars like this will be featured in the Smithsonian some day as an example of our 21st century consumerism ...  oh well, it's close to home and my husband likes it ...

I wish I could say nice things all the way around.   From the moment of driving in,  I loved the look of the surroundings. Was a little taken aback by the mandatory valet parking but relaxed when I saw it was complimentary - a very nice touch.   The place was crowded with people who all seemed (for lack of a better word) relaxed. Well heeled too I'm sure. I was going to a college alumnae club event, but wasn't sure I would go so far for brunch on my own.   Once we went into the building, it was really cool to imagine it being someone's private home - it was very welcoming! As were the people. The friendliness and quality of service was excellent.   However, given the price, I was very surprised and disappointed with the food. For brunch, there was a plate of small breakfast breads on the table - for 8 people we each got one. No one asked if we wanted more, or offered the fruits or breakfast meats included in the brunch.   We also had our choice of 3 possible entrees. Being on an Eggs Benedict kick, I naturally gravitated to that. Mentally, I had a moment of fondly remembering the Daily Dose with their 7 options - here there was one.    When it came, it was short on Hollandaise. There was a tiny pile of potatoes on the side, mixed with some orange (squash?) vegetables. Now, at the risk of sounding really nit-picky, but I would have liked to know what "hacienda potatoes" were before getting them and the option to get them plain. The whole plate (artistic vision aside) just looked empty before I even touched it ...  Anyway, the potatoes were left. I left hungry.  MH's strawberry and mascarpone stuffed brioche french toast was ok, too sweet for my taste.   Given the gaps in what they advertised and what we were offered, I figured it was roughly an extra $12 per person for unlimited coffee and the one pastry.   The coffee was surprisingly good. We filled up at a central station, and the server refilled our cups for us. Very nice of him, since he had to walk to the urn for each cup. No cream on the table - surprising - so he had to make a couple repeat trips. Not for me, after the first time - I hate to put people out to do things like this for me - but you'd think it would be better planned.   So my experience was mixed. Surroundings and service awesome - food not so much. Value for money - very low. If I enjoyed everything it would have been worth it but as it was, no. If I had a choice I would rather go to Daily Dose and donate the difference balance to charity.

We were treated here last night. After reading the other reviews I was a bit nervous about Surly Aunty, but guess we got lucky - she wasn't Surly at all. Rather nice in fact. She took the time to explain what halva was to the adjoining table, both of whom seemed relatively new to the concept.   The place was small. Nice decorations. One deep red wall. However the ceiling tiles were as described - in need of urgent repair. There was one flat screen tv at the center of the room, placed to (somewhat) obscure the window view of the back parking lot.   When we got there, it was set to a desi satellite channel (showing a drama) which imo added to the atmosphere of it being like a home. However, shortly after we sat down a young man wandered in, changed the channel to football, regardless of other people who were engrossed in the drama and sat down to eat. Later I realized he was probably the son of said not-so-Surly Auntie. He certainly treated the place like it WAS his home, so maybe I'm not all wrong.   Food ok. I had the chicken boti, well cooked and juicy but quite spicy. Just a personal preference, I like this not overly spiced so you can really taste the meat and not just get a mouthful of hot. It did not come sizzling and the onions on the side were cold. Not just room temperature, but refrigerator cold. It came with raita but no lettuce, tomatoes or lemon. MH loved his food so that was something. About the naans, they seemed like a cross between naans and roti - coarser texture b/c of more wheat flour than white.   I would go again to pick up something for him when I didn't want to cook, but for myself, no. There is outside seating, but given that it directly faces the street and the light rail, I'm not sure who would actually use it. Oh and it was really hard to find.

Just went there this past Saturday and was impressed with the food and atmosphere. The only sad thing was how empty it was - both for the owners (who are very nice) and the people that are missing out on it. By comparison, Pita Jungle next door was packed and I seriously doubt the food is any cheaper or better, not to mention the atmosphere. We had a bunch of appetizers and ordered the koobideh as a side item - it was a lot of food. The persian salad and the hummus were both huge, enough for 3 people at least. It was fresh and delicious - try it, you'll be glad you did!

Large, well run and stocked Indian grocery store. Part of a plaza that includes a restaurant, beauty salon and chaat cafe. Also has gifts and clothing. That said, every time I've been there, I've been a bit disappointed. I get groceries but that's it. First run Bollywood movies - mostly for rent, not sale. And mostly out. You can buy original older ones (sometimes new) but in any case they're all expensive. No meat either. I wish there was one place that had everything together but until then I go all over ...

I just had the ice cream. That was when I didn't know where to go for ice cream. It tasted artificial, much like how everything else looked. There was also a weird feeling about the place - too self-consciously "cute"  suspension of reality - almost as if a crime was imminent like a bad TV show. Looking at the rest of the food was almost disturbing - like school cafeteria food, only worse. Oh well, it discouraged me from eating anything the whole rest of the day.

An interesting place theme-wise - quaint, crowded. As the name suggests, european in both look and feel. A bit fussy somehow. Huge menu. I really liked the pasta salad I ordered - huge portion as previously mentioned. However afterwards I couldn't help thinking, damn, I could do this myself at home!   It inspired me to explore vinagrettes in general and eat more vegetables which is a good thing. And I was right about being able to make the dressings. BTW, walmart has this new thing called a multi-mixer which is great for making (and storing) your own vinagrettes at home. Check out epicurious. But I digress.   To wrap up, huge menu, ok to good food, mostly high prices especially on dessert items. I took home the peanut butter cheesecake but was not impressed with it. Plus it was about $6 a slice. The case definitely beckons but I wouldn't fall to temptation there again.  Also notably, the wait staff was slow, unresponsive and not particularly friendly even though there was only one other couple in the whole restaurant. Maybe they've been told to be that way in line with the European theme??? just kidding but it does make one wonder...

I will preface this by saying I'm not a big BBQ restaurant fan, but given my stellar experience with Joe's Real Food I finally decided to give it a try. Takeout being the equivalent of a toe in the water.  Got the turkey, as I figured that would be a good test. AMAZING. So moist, flavorful - at the risk of sounding like an ad - the REAL thing. Even the taste of the sauce (which I almost never eat and didn't this time either) was good.   Real homey place - full of down-to-earth people eating food with a lot of enjoyment. Am surprised no one photographed the mural on the right side of the restaurant - it was pretty cool. Covers the whole wall and really adds to the atmosphere. Made me think of (my idea of) Texas.  More notes - I wish they mentioned what salad dressings they have on the menu. Oh, and there's a takeout window on the side and they sell the meat just by the pound.  I can't wait to get REALLY hungry, go back and try everything!

Just a followup since MH and I went there last night after Stellar Adventures - totally a snap decision but we each had had only a granola bar all day.   Ok, so he wasn't enthused about it before but that all changed once he got a taste of the beef brisket and hot bbq sauce. More on that later. So we had the corn, mac&ch, and potato salad as sides - my favorite was the latter. However, MH felt in future he would just go for the meat. Nice bread and cornbread. Wasn't too thrilled with the honey butter - it was nice but I felt the bread was sweet enough without it.   he really loved the sauce though. Before we left, he added more to the leftovers. Since we ate early, the second half came out at 11 or so. Imagine my surprise when he came barreling (yes, I mean this)  in afterwards, literally breathing fire at me! "My god, in quantity that stuff is spicy!" And I don't know what was in it but he was in "I can lift-you-up kick - which I haven't seen in like 9 years. Bouncing with energy! Does it confer a superhero complex on one, or what???  glad I bought a bottle - can do this experiment again ... :-)

oh man, I gained 5 pounds on Sunday but since it was from Joe's I don't even really care - it was that good.   I won't go into the local ingredients, Agritopia, etc since others already have but it is a wonderful thing. More below.  The food was awesome. Very fresh, delicious and wholesome - you actually felt like you were eating food that was also good for you. Granted we just had the burgers and ice cream but there's a whole menu there to explore on future visits. I loved the signature burger with pesto & fontina, neither of which I had ever thought of but worked very well. The onion rings were good, as were the milkshakes and sundae. It really fills you up fast though, so try to pace yourself!  I was equally enchanted with the setting. Beautiful place. Just like a farm oasis in the midst of suburbia - I hope it doesn't vanish in the midst of the houses all around it. Even the bathroom was noteworthy - clean, black and white with dolls and a closed circuit tv. It reminded me of the Jetsons - you know, the 60s idea of space age.   Sitting outside wasn't too hot, as it's the one place I've seen so far where the misters really work and don't just spray you and puddle down.  The only down side was when I asked where the farm stand was and the cashier pointed it out, but without mentioning it was closed. Nor was there a sign at the actual location indicating when it would be open in the fall.  Oh, and what was really nice was the sense of everyone relaxing - just kicking back and having a good time. definitely worth going to again, and again ...

very nice setting, right next door to Joe's Farm Grill (previously reviewed and raved about). Friendly, cozy and crowded. Great, huge sandwiches and good coffee. I am picky about coffee though. A lot of places have coffee that tastes good but for some reason makes me very thirsty. Such was the case here, but it was ok. The absolute standout for me was the peanut butter scone. Never had one, or even heard of one before. It lived up to my hopes and I enjoyed every moment I spent eating it.   Added bonus, the fresh dates were out at the farm stand. However, the plastic thing on the wall that was supposed to hold the cash for the honor system was empty of envelopes. I asked at the coffee shop but they didn't know. Said it was a different place. Well, ok, I went back. Stuck my money in the plastic thing. Figured even if someone else took it at least I did my part. It wouldn't be on my conscience. Had to have those dates.   All of Joe's stuff - you're great - I hope you stay in business forever! or at least a really, really long time!

I'm a sucker for craft fairs and this is one of the better ones I've seen. Huge variety of friendly vendors - from affordable to $225 for an embossed leather book cover. And don't get me started on the outdoor garden fountains - just gorgeous! Made me wish I had a house ... and a lot of money ...  I parked (free) at the Light Rail station (McClintock & Apache) 3 stops away - didn't want to deal with the traffic and parking being unfamiliar with the area. It was very easy on and off.  Only one slightly negative comment - and this may be due to not being familiar with the area, but the layout was very confusing. Even with the brochure helpfully passed out at the beginning. Given how the booths were located, I kept following the side paths and forgetting where I had already been. Next time, I'll try to map it all out first before shopping.   I'm picky and didn't intend to buy anything but once I got to the food section, I left with a lot of bags. Amazing flavored pasta, chocolate, caramel and peanut butter hot fudge sauces and dip mixes - all the free samples were like a meal! There is also a specific food area to sit and eat. I highly recommend bringing along a tote bag, or even better a wheeled cart  - they sell folding lightweight ones for laundry at Walmart. That would have prevented currently aching arms and shoulders! I got there at 11 and didn't leave till 3 - much longer than I usually take at fairs.  Come prepared for a good time! I'm looking forward to going again in spring!

ok, 2 stars b/c it's cheap.   I honestly wish I had read all the other reviews first, and then I wouldn't have pulled in, thinking it was fate that I saw it at lunchtime. Got a fair sampling of everything to take home for me and the hubby to the tune of $18 or so. Ok, maybe not so cheap. Ate it for lunch, have a lot left over but honestly don't want to look at it again.   Starting with the crabettes - I was not sure of the size, and optimistic that they would be small pieces with real crab. I should have asked but didn't want to identify myself as a first-timer. Or an idiot. Take your pick.   I should have - my bad - those things are totally nasty. Especially when you start thinking about all the chemicals you're ingesting after the first two bites.  Fish - in line with other reviews, I thought this would be solid pieces of fish in beer batter. Not cafeteria quality square patties with crumbly breading. Everything tasted really artificial. No tartar sauce available as far as I could ascertain. The "sauce" they give appears to be just ketchup so why not just call it that?   French fries - as limp and unappetizing as I've ever seen. And I have a mountain of them left. I'll say this, they don't skimp on these.   Look, this is the deal, if you're hankering for fish and chips, imo the best (disclaimer - still new here so there may be a better cheaper alternative I don't know about) is Shakespeare's on Val  Vista. Yes, it's more expensive but better to pay more for good food than waste it on bad. $13 to $15 for one person, but the plate is huge - enough for both of us. Less than I paid at Pete's. They also have an all-you-can-eat on Fridays too.  However, I did have an entertaining time waiting the 20 or so minutes in line. Quite a variety of people seem to love it here. The mix, which probably wouldn't be seen together in any other place, was made especially amusing by the 4 young Jehovah's Witnesses in suits and matching blue ties.   End of visit. No more. At least hubby ate all the cole slaw. And seems fine.

I discovered this by accident and have to say it was bittersweet.  Having just finished packing & unpacking, cross country I was overwhelmed with stuff and determined (still am) to pare DOWN. Regardless, the home-design freak/scavenger in me went mentally crazy looking at all the stuff I wanted desperately to get ... and would have if I had a house here. I limited myself to a pair of lampshades in a pattern (Waverly Cottage Rose I think) that I've been collecting guest room items in forever. Never thought that they had lampshades. $2 each in my hot little hand. I will be back for more. Thank you ReStore for all that you do ...

Huge menu. Lots of choices. Pleasant decor, very crowded - all good signs. The two of us had the New York omelet and Spinach Florentine. Hopefully without sounding too nitpicky, I found the latter name to be a bit redundant, b/c of that funny.  Even though the size of the plates didn't overwhelm us, as has happened before, neither of us could finish the food. Cooked well.  The menu prices were (imo) uneven. Most of it was reasonably priced but there were some items that seemed very expensive for what you were getting. Like sliced tomatoes on the side for $2.45. However, I liked the option of ordering hollandaise as a (very reasonably priced) side. Likewise pitcher or water with lemon on table.  Pricewise, most important would be the coffee - we both ordered a cup. It came in a small carafe but the bill for both coffees was $4.58. That just seemed very expensive to me. It was typical diner coffee - better than some but definitely not what I'd choose on a regular basis. I don't expect it to be excellent but it is an integral part of breakfast out.  The total for 2 came to about $27 with tip - a lot more than I thought reasonable for breakfast.  Re: service, it was quick and fast. Not particularly friendly or unfriendly. But I had to clean the table after as there were grounds and coffee under where she first placed the carafe. Plus when I requested more cream (those jugs are tiny!) she put it right on the open newspaper on my right that I was reading. Needless to say, that didn't thrill me.   Overall, the food was ok, but I would look long and hard before going back.

Just came back from dinner there. Let me preface by saying I had a gift certificate and without it am not sure I would have gone. Regardless. I'm not sure if I can write an essay but there are a number of things that jumped out at me. First and foremost, how friendly the owners are. Both husband and wife came to our table separately to chat. The other wait staff was ok, friendly but not out of the ordinary. Since bread usually comes first ... I have to say I was a bit disappointed being used to the piping hot loaves at Carabbas, or or other places that have a variety of rolls. These were like ordinary sliced white bread without much flavor. The specials sounded good but the server didn't give the prices till I asked specifically. MH was surprised not to see Corona in the beer selections. He also wanted the filet mignon which they were out of. He settled for the sole (which was good he said) and I had the Chicken Caprese special, but I had to make a special request to get basil included. Which seemed a bit counter intuitive but anyway. I wasn't crazy about it, or the wine sauce it came in. What I really wish had been different was the fact that it didn't come with pasta, but potatoes and vegetables. Not what I'd expect at an Italian restaurant. Sure, if it was a choice ... but it wasn't. Oh, and I didn't see pesto or alfredo sauce anywhere in the menu. Suffice it to say the owners are very nice but even that may not be enough to get me back. I like being excited over leftovers and tonight I'm just not. I did get a piece of cheesecake to bring home. Since it's going to be consumed in the next half hour I may have something to add ...

Thanks to Donald and Carin for sponsoring this wonderful event! Just got back and it was a lot of fun. Great food and drink not to mention the company - shoutouts to Jim and Kevin ...   I also commend the waitstaff highly for their friendliness and extreme competence in handling the many and varied orders of 25+ people with grace and efficiency.  Just as a side note, I was also taken with the (XTREME?) hand dryers in the bathroom, which told me at the spout to FEEL THE POWER  That about says it all.  Thanks again and best wishes for the season!

I was so excited when I read about this place - it was something I never thought I'd find. Backstory - when I was a teenager and would hang out weekends in Harvard Square my favorite place to eat was Warburtons - anyone remember it? It all connected with the Susan Howatch novels (Penmarric) I was reading at the time - anyway I digress. Suffice it to say that the whole pasty concept was intriguing and this place was terrific. It closed down years ago but I kept hoping I'd find something similar ... someday.  To present day, newly come to the area. We finally made it to the Mesa location. I was glad there wasn't a wait, but walking in was a strange experience. It was dark, loud with no one at the entrance to seat us. Figured it wasn't that kind of place. The decor was a definite turnoff for me - cold, weird seating that felt like a black and white railroad car. I hate to be nit-picky but the first thing I saw when I sat down was a spider going up the wall next to me.  Ok, enough on atmosphere. The food ... huge menu that's a lot of fun to look at with lots of choices. I had the Greek salad and Greek chicken pasty. The salad was great - enough for 2. MH had the Mexican, which was actually quite spicy, and he's very used to spice. Overall our opinion on the pasties was ... ok. Quite filling - we only had half each. However, we thought they'd be a bit bigger to justify the cost, or a dollar or two cheaper since they don't come with anything else.  The dough was sturdy, well formed for holding the fillings but it was definitely hard.  Re: the service - it was good - she was friendly ... but it was hard to find anyone when we wanted anything, especially when we wanted to pay and leave.  I hesitated writing this since everyone seems to love it so much, but this was my experience ... not bad, but not somewhere I want to spend my precious restaurant dollars for a so-so experience. The atmosphere was kind of off-putting. Given everything, I don't think we'll be back. And I had such hopes! Sorry Cornish Pasty!

ok, this is my premise. I am a erratic ice cream eater. Not regularly but when I crave it, I search like a woman possessed. Even in Massachusetts in November. And I like independent locations. Cold Stone leaves me cold. So, when I came to Arizona at the end of April something in me tripped off this need and for the next two weeks I looked in vain for such a shop. However, it appeared that the only ice cream around here was gelato. I figured it was a regional craze and stubbornly refused to settle and try it instead. FYI, I have since and am glad I did so. But I digress. After we found a place to live and I was doing my daily round of exploring I found this place. I love it. I love it. I love it. The look, the atmosphere, the small dollar cups you can take home and eat individually without the 10 minutes of wrist-wrenching pain I get trying to scoop out Ben & Jerry's. The reasonable prices, the wide selections of delicious flavors, the coupons. Ok, when I'm there, I'm like a kid in a candy shop ... but it's an ice cream store. Even better. Now if they could just stay open past 9 ... weekends at least? Please ???

Behold and Beware The Power of Mexican Chiles in Action  That was the theme of our first time here. MH ordered the Steak Tampico, marked as a 3 pepper dish. Seeing what followed with him was entirely new to me. If you can see a brown person turn red, you know it's hot.   His take: "among the spiciest things I've ever eaten, better than sinus medication if you have a cold". Hotter than the most diabolical chicken wings that we had together and needed 2 full pitchers of water with. Evidently the chiles in the red sauce which covered the bottom of the plate spread into the guacamole, the lettuce, the tomato, the olive ...  The white sauce on top performed the same function for the steak ...   Although he finished about half, which is usual. I wonder how long the effect will last and am monitoring the situation ...   Our server was friendly and attentive. The chips and salsas were filling. My chicken ? dish was fine. Didn't see why sour cream is an (expensive) extra. The flour tortillas on the side were ok, but bland. Nothing to compare with El Sol. The plates were cute, as they had the name of the restaurant  handwritten and fired into the various bright colors ...   The menu had photos, a little blurry but nice touch. Maybe it's just me but I'm not really fond of burritos and chimichangas swimming in sauce. Not that I got either this time, but if I do a special request would definitely be in order.   Overall, I don't think the quality of the food is worth the price. ok, but ordinary. I may go again, being married to a hot food junkie, but who knows - the effects of this particular mouth-burning may go deeper than I think. Time will tell ...   off to give him an acid pill :-)

Lunch today. I wish I had just gone to McD across the street instead - it would have been cheaper and not left me with this queasy feeling hours later ...   I went based on the other two reviews. Granted it's been almost 6 months since I've had Chinese food but I think the lack contributed to this impulsive move.   I had the cold noodles with sesame sauce and some veg potstickers. Once I got in the car with them, I was immediately struck by the new odor - it was almost like feet - (sorry to be gross) very strange. I didn't really want to eat them but reasoned that I had to try at least one. Even though it smelled stronger out of the box. Which I did. Just one. And I love pan-fried dumplings.   Then I moved on to the noodles, which were marginally better (had added bonus of chicken - not mentioned) but not by much. Plus it didn't taste the way I expected - lighter and more tart sesame flavor. No cucumber - peapods instead.  The one lady behind the counter (Lily?) was nice even though her English is limited. Evidently she's the greeter, cashier, cook and probably driver all in one.   The place was much as described - small with some booths along the wall. Bistro - I suppose but it's not like any bistro I've ever seen ... Clean enough, but there's signs of neglect that make the place look really sad - in a break-one's-heart type of way. That and the fact that there were no other customers and only one slip before mine at 12:45.  The prices were quite reasonable for the quantity of food offered. However, given that I intend to jettison the lot later, for me it was not economical ... or wise - I was sick the whole rest of the day.  However, I just tried two things. Given that the menu is quite large and I could just be unlucky - there is an invisible star there for other people who want to try it and have stronger stomachs. Just imagine it's two.

I first found this place in May right after we moved here, so my review is probably overdue ... it's a long, interesting story of what-did-happen. I thought I wrote one already ...  Anyway, we were in the first week of a month-long hotel stay and always looking for good desi (particularly Pakistani) food. So we walked in to check it out, not planning on staying for dinner at that point. But the owner was so friendly and welcoming we changed our minds fast.   I would recommend the buffet over the menu unless there's something specific you want - it's varied with a lot of dishes to choose from. Things I particularly liked - the chicken tikka which is not completely covered in spice so you can really taste the grill of the meat instead of gulping water frantically. You don't find that in a lot of places.   There is sometimes music on weekends - best to call ahead but it really adds to the atmosphere - very cool. The other thing I specifically wanted to mention was the lack of yogurt on the buffet. When I didn't find it (my 2nd time) I asked for some and was given a huge cereal bowl full - it was so delicious I had to eat the whole thing. It was homemade, fresh every day.  Others have covered the decor, completely authentic - very nice. The owner told us the furniture (chairs at least) came directly from Pakistan.   I've been here about 4 times now and it is always a fallback. Also, during Ramadan they offered free Iftar food every night.  This restaurant is actually the second one with the same name and management - the first is in Berkeley, CA and has been there for years. Wonderful to find it here too!  If you have the slightest interest in Pakistani / Indian cuisine, try this place - I'm pretty sure you won't be sorry!

I needed a car while mine was in the shop overnight. Now it's hissing and has to go back to the garage, but that's another story ... Anyway, I did some searching of local prices of car rental places not at the airport. I was very surprised at how expensive Enterprise and a couple others were. Then I found this Budget, which is owned and operated by this very nice gentleman named Sam. Sorry I don't remember his last name. He quoted me a rate which was half of every other place I had tried. When I went in, he was very friendly - the process was quick and a pleasure, especially compared with other places. Today I returned the car at noon, fully cogizant that it was going to cost me another day. He very kindly adjusted the price for me a bit and then closed the location to give me a ride to the garage. I don't know anyone who's the sole proprietor who would do that. He went over and above what I expected and with a really friendly attitude. Please patronize him if you need a car - you will be satisfied, I am sure. I will go there if I have to over any other place.

After reading the reviews I went here last night. Overall it was a great experience. We planned to sit inside but within 10 seconds knew it was going to be too loud. So outside it was - from there it was perfect to listen to the band (Beatles covers - very good) and it really added to the atmosphere. The misters did bother me were the misters - I love them but they do tend to get everything wet, including the food. I was cringing as the drops fell on the yorkshire pudding ... couldn't eat it fast enough! Plus they kept blowing in my face and on my purse - the whole empty right side of the table. We both ordered the fish and it came very quickly - they should pace the serving a bit, because the appetizer wasn't finished and I had the salad left to go - ended up packing both. However the fish was awesome - and so big - I was flabbergasted. Ate maybe a third of it. Also loved the pear cider - so much so I'm going looking for it today. Surprised my husband, as I've never liked beer or similar drinks ... Server very nice, as was the manager who was also checking tables - a nice touch. Nice location, walking area, shops, etc. but I was surprised (and a bit saddened) to see it so empty on a Saturday - any ideas why? Will definitely go again.

Update from this friday. Awesome band again, but really loud - conversation's just impossible anywhere after they start. I also forgot to mention that this place introduced me to pear cider, which I always will remember and thank it for. But anyway, we went for the all-you-can-eat fish fry, which once again was excellent. I also really like the fries here - better flavor than almost anywhere I've tried. I made the mistake though of skipping the fish and trying the newly-added pasty. Cheese, onion and potato in case you're interested. However, all I could see and taste was potato inside. I managed a few bites and then sat there depressed while good fish was being consumed all around me. And my conscience wouldn't let me grab it. After a bit, Ashley came by and so nicely agreed to bring me a piece of fish instead. If you read this, thank you! That saved my night. Just finished the leftovers yesterday and am already missing them ... Can't wait till fall to sit out and listen to the band ...
