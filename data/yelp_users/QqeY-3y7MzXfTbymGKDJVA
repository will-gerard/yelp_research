I liked it. The food was pretty good and the wine and beer selections were great.  It's definitely more of a happy hour spot for me though.

Their happy hour prices are very hard to beat. Perfect location next to ASU. Not to mention the sushi quality here is good. Not many places in Arizona can too 101's sushi I highly recommend this place for people who are 1) looking for good sushi, 2) looking for a good happy hour, 3) looking for great prices especially college students.

I only go on Wednesday nights for $1 You-Call-Its.  I've had some of the food and it's okay.  The bar itself isn't very appealing. In fact, the clientele that The Vine draws is rather questionable, except during the school year when it draws a lot of students.

Majerles is a great place to watch a game.  I primarily go Tuesdays for Thunder Trivia and sit in Ines' section.  She is one of the best servers I've had.  Then I go Friday and Sundays and see Jen at the bar.  Both make my time at Majerles every time I go there.  The food is good, the housemade drinks are delicious, and the happy hour prices are unbeatable!  Not to mention, there are televisions everywhere and they will put on any game you need/want to watch.

I have only been one time and I am not the biggest country fan.  But the bar is great and I had a good time.  However, it was empty though I hear it gets pretty packed when a big name country star/band plays there.

A first class way to go to the movies. I started going to the movies here in early 2012 and have never been back to another theater since! iPic is truly the only way to watch a movie in the theater now.

Seats aren't comfortable, food is decent. Try to be a luxury movie theater, but clearly not the case.

Handlebar is not the typical bar on Mill Ave, which is why I think it is one of the best bars on Mill Ave.  There is no DJ, but there is music which makes the environment very casual and relaxing.  The drink specials are great and their food selection, though limited, is very good and hand-made.  Never once have I had a bad time at Handlebar and I don't think I ever will.

Great food and drinks! I'm a fan of the Smores martini! And their wings and nachos are bomb!  Great thing is the kitchen is open late, so you can catch a movie at Harkins and still get some great food and drinks after the movie. Definitely returning VERY soon!

Love Portillo's! I used to go to the Buena Park, CA location all of the time before moving to Arizona. So glad they opened one in Scottsdale!

Pretty sweet spot! Has an old school feeling with the old school video games including TWO N64 systems at the booths.  One game that stood out was the skee ball where you can earn points to win free drinks.  Haven't tried the food yet, but I've heard some good things about it, so will definitely be trying the food soon.
