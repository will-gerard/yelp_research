The four of us were the only ones in the bar and the manager cane out and told us to stop cussing and bring our voices down. We were literally the only ones in the bar. I just don't get it. Did he hate the gays? He for sure did not appreciate the business we brought him. Never going back again. Such a shame. I want to select zero stars but this app won't let me.

Rodney is the best waiter ever! He served us efficiently and kept the jokes rolling. We laughed over mimosas and had a spectacular time! Rodney rocks!!
