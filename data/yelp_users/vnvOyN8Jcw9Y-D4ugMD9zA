While visiting Arizona some co-workers of mine were recommending places to eat when the name Los Taquitos came up. With Mexican food being one of my favorite types of ethnic eats I knew while in the area I would definitely have to give this place a try and I'm glad I did.  Situated in a safe and standard strip mall sits this spectacular site sure to satisfy your stomach. I walked in to see some very nice art of what appeared to be Santa Muerte or some other skeletons on the wall and placed my order. Per a recommendation from a co-worker I ordered the "bombero pollo".  Once my order was ready it was time to head back to my office and consume this.  The bombero pollo was a chicken burrito with some hot sauce and cheese on the outside, I also got beans and rice with it. To start with the entree the hot sauce on the outside really gives this a lot of its flavor. It's fairly hot and I was warned ahead of time, but I'm no chicken, I merely eat chickens, on a burrito. The chicken and other ingridients were good, a little watery. Overall I was very impressed with the bombero pollo as the hot sauce was a great compliment.  The rice and beans left a little to be desired. These tasted worse than the ones I get at my local Mexican restaurant in suburban Chicago. I'm willing to take a stab in the dark and guess they were frozen and thawed out due to the somewhat bunchy and odd consistency of bean dip. That's not to say they were bad, just not ideal or on par with what I've had other places.  Overall, I really liked the Bombero Pollo, the hot sauce gives it a fantastic flavor. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and this place was fantastic and I would highly recommend it if you happen to be in Phoenix looking for some caliente lunch or dinner. Cinco stars for Los Taquitos.

Ted's Hot Dogs is one of those places that just emits an aura of times long gone. When walking into this establishment I immediately heard music from the 1950s and 60s. I could smell the meat cooking on the grill and I felt like I was in another world. I looked over Ted's menu and some of the signage and became aware that this place is tied to and related to a chain of "Ted's Hot Dogs" found in Buffalo New York.   The line was fairly considerable on my initial visit and after perusing the menu I settled on an all beef hot dog, onion rings and a soft drink. With the hot dog I decided to make it as close to a Chicago style hot dog as possible. So I asked for mustard, relish,, onions, tomato, and a pickle slice.  I took the dog to an open table and dug in. The taste of the sausage here is definitely different than the steamed Chicago style dogs I'm used to. One primary reason is that everything (well all the meats) at Ted's is char grilled. This gives a nice grilled flavor to it, the actual hot dog used had an unusual filler taste with a somewhat sweet flavor rather than spicy. All things considered it was a strange mix.  The onion rings weren't so great, these were very thin onion peels deep fried. While they were plentiful there was very little onion and just lots of batter. I'd say I was a bit disappointed with them.  Since I've been in Arizona for quite a few days I did decide to return to Ted's and try things just a little differently. I went for a footlong dog which was only a little more expensive on my second visit. And rather than go for the toppings mentioned above I opted for Chili. The footlong dog was a great value and while the chilli was an extra 60 or so cents, I felt this was a much better dog than the one I ordered the first time and a lot of food for the money.  I ALSO got a regular cheeseburger, this was fairly standard and tasted like most burgers that come off of a backyard grill. Not bad, but nothing worth writing home about.  My overall opinion of Ted's is that I love the ambiance and atmosphere, the food is pretty good and it's a good value if you go for the giant footlong hot dog. I am going to give Ted's Hot Dogs four stars and a recommendation if you happen to be in Tempe Arizona.

While visiting Arizona I was driving down Baseline Road in Tempe and noticed a place called Tom's BBQ Chicago Style. What caught my eye in particular was the signage stating that they carried Chicago Style Italian Beef. The next time I went down Baseline road I made sure to stop by and give it a try.  I walked in to find a small restaurant. After looking over the menu I noticed they did indeed serve Chicago style hot dogs, and being the hot dog critic I obviously had to try one. I also ordered an Italian Beef as they had a big sign in front and I figured it must be a specialty of theirs, after about a 10 minute wait my food was ready.   We'll start with the Italian Beef. This Italian beef was bland, they had the soggy part right. The bread was right, it had the right texture and softness. The Italian Beef meat itself did not have the usual Italian Beef seasoning that I find in Chicagoland. I've had worse Italian Beef sandwiches, but for a place putting this at the top of their signage I would expect it to be better.  The hot dog was even worse. This was a giant sloppy mess of a hot dog. The poppy seed bun was the right type (not a given in Arizona), but there was about three hot dogs worth of mustard on this thing. There was way too much tomato and too thick, this caused tomato water to soak the bun causing the bun to become soggy. There was a thick and watery pickle slice that caused the bun to be even soggier. The relish was also applied too liberally, while it was the neon green style of relish typically found in Chicago the application was just a mess. There were two sport peppers about the length of the dog between the two of them. Then cucumber slices and practically no onion. The bun fell apart as I attempted to pick it up, this was just a total disaster of a hot dog and puts a bad name on Chicago style dogs.  Overall Tom's BBQ was a big disappointment. Despite signs indicating "Chicago Style" all over the outside, the two Chicago style food items I had here were lousy. Perhaps their BBQ is better but if and when I return to Arizona I'll take my chances elsewhere. Two stars for Tom's.

Of fast food burger joints few places are as well known in areas where they have absolutely no store presence as the chain "In-N-Out Burger". While visiting Arizona on a business trip I was aware In-N-Out Burger was a fixture in the area, and it had been well over a decade since the last time I had stopped at one.   Since my first pair of visits to In-N-Out Burgers in California in the early 2000s, I've seen people wearing In-N-Out Burger shirts, read countless articles about the chain, and decided the next time I'm near one I'll give it another shot. My feeling in previous visits to In-N-Out was that while good, and inexpensive there was nothing exceptional about the food there. Would I notice something I didn't before?  When I arrived at my hotel in Tempe Arizona I was immediately able to spot an In-N-Out location and visited several times during my two week stay. On my initial visit I ordered a 3x3 which is three beef patties and three slices of cheese served "Animal style" which is with lettuce, tomato, the beef patties being mustard cooked; pickle, extra Thousand Island style sauce known as "spread" with grilled onions. I also got Lemonade and animal style fries which added spread and onions to the top of my fries. Overall, I thought the burger was very good, especially for the price, but that even with the spread the fries were a bit lacking.   My next visit I went in a slightly different direction, passed on getting any fries and just got a regular 3x3 burger without the animal style additions and a chocolate shake. I noticed that besides the lettuce, tomato and onions it didn't taste as different as I thought it would. I also obtained this through the drive-thru and was given a box rather than a bag, making it somewhat difficult to transport without spilling. The shake I had was excellent, and while I was in the area I tried vanilla,chocolate and strawberry shakes and all were good.  My overall opinion of In-N-Out is this, if you've never visited one it isn't the legendary once in a lifetime experience you may have heard about. However, it is very good for fast food and is quite inexpensive. The most unique characteristic of getting an animal style In-N-Out burger is that it is unique tasting. Nothing exactly tastes quite like an In-N-Out burger, the sharp onions and more sour than big mac sauce thousand island spread give the burger its character. It might not be the best tasting fast food burger ever, but it has its own identity. I am going to give In-N-Out four stars.

While visiting Arizona I called upon the local Yelper population to assist me in finding hot dog joints to visit and eventually review. One of the places suggested was "Jimmy's Hot Dogs" which serves Chicago style hot dogs and within a few days I had made my way there. I pulled up to a non-descript looking building and sure enough Jimmy's was there with Vienna Beef umbrella's out and visible.   I walked in and decided to go for a hot dog and fries. I took a few pictures of the place on the inside and headed back to the table to actually sample the hot dog here. I ordered a hot dog with everything, fries and a cup of water. A few minutes later my order was up and it was time to try it.  The bun here was a classic poppy seed bun as often found on Chicago style hot dogs. The bun was mostly soft with a few of the edges being a bit dry. The relish was of the neon green variety and was applied a little too heavily. The onion was chopped and applied nicely to the dog. The mustard was well applied as well, two thin slices of tomato were at the bottom. A thin pickle slice at the top and a pair of sport peppers were on the dog as well. The sausage used here was the classic Vienna beef natural casing and was properly heated up. The overall taste of the dog was excellent. The bun on the edges was a little more dry than I would prefer and the relish was applied a bit too excessively, but overall this tasted excellent and is a great representation of a Chicago style hot dog for people in Phoenix to try.  The fries wrapped with the hot dog were "fresh cut fries". Over the past decade or so these have become extremely popular with hot dog vendors in Chicago. The good news is these taste like authentic Chicago style fresh cut fries, the bad news is as in Chicagoland, these are usually hit or miss and these were about average for ones found around Chicago. They weren't too greasy but they were a bit on the bland side. I didn't finish off the fries, but I will say these were a lot like what many places in Chicago serve.  Overall for a Chicago-Style restaurant 1500 miles away, Jimmy's Hot Dogs easily exceeded my expectations. I'd highly recommend this place if you want a good example of what a Chicago style hot dog should taste like in Arizona. I tried several other places (with more reviews coming) that were serving alleged Chicago style dogs while in Arizona, and none compared to Jimmy's. I am going to give this place a full five star review.

While visiting the metropolitan Phoenix area I decided to post a message on Yelp talk to enlist the assistance of local Yelpers in helping me locate and identify places to pick up some hot dogs during my stay. One of the first places suggested was "Short Leash" which apparently has a much longer title of "Short Leash Dogs Sit.. Stay Restaurant". A day later I was off in search of this eatery and further more on the hunt for a good hot dog.  After driving past this place several times I eventually spotted the food truck associated with the restaurant on the outside and realized I was there. There wasn't any immediately noticeable signage from Roosevelt street indicating that this was the right place which threw me for a bit of a loop. There is a door to enter from the side near where the truck was parked. I walked in, verified I was at the right place and got a menu.   After looking over the various hot dog options, all around 8.50 to 9.50 I asked for a recommendation from the lady there and settled on the "Devil Dog". I had an option to try it with different types of sausages and went with the all beef hot dog. One interesting note about this place is that it's a waiter/waitress style dining establishment rather than a typical order at a counter and grab your food when it's ready hot dog joint. This place also seems very bar oriented, but because I both don't drink, and it was around 10:30 AM, I stuck with water to compliment my meal. With the Devil Dog, I was offered a choice of chips or salad. Being a straight male I went with the chips.  I snapped a few pictures of the inside while waiting for my food, and in under five minutes the "Devil Dog" had arrived. It came wrapped in paper with a toothpick with a pickle on it, the chips being off to the side. I dug into the chips first. These were kettle style chips that were hard but tasty. After eating a few I unwrapped the hot dog from it's paper prison. The hot dog was wrapped in a tortilla, it was a long hot dog that was skinless. The Devil Dog had a red peppers, green peppers, cheese, onions and some seasoning that I can't immediately identify. This tasted very Southwestern and was quite good.  Unfortunately, the tortilla wasn't quite up to the task of holding all the peppers and other ingredients on the hot dog as much of it slopped off, I scooped up some of the remaining peppers with chips.  Overall I found this to be an excellent and non-traditional hot dog. It was a bit on the pricey side but was well worth the money. I was both impressed with and enjoyed my trip to Short Leash and would recommend it. I'm going to give this place a full five star review. Thank you Phoenix area Yelpers for recommending this place.

In the state of Michigan there exists a particular type of hot dog known as a coney. Why is it called a coney? No one knows. As far as I know it's not named after Coney Island in New York. It's not named after the SNL sketch turned 90s movie the Coneheads either, and it's not named after Joseph Kony the leader of the Ugandan resistance movement.   What is a Coney hot dog you might be asking? Well it's a hot dog with a chilli, mustard and onion. This differs a bit from a regular chilli dog due to the mustard to balance out the chilli flavor.   And this brings me to Detroit Coney Grill, while in the metropolitan Phoenix area I checked around with local yelpers to help me track down hot dog places to review and this was one of those recommendations. So one afternoon I set my sights on visiting Detroit Coney Grill and giving it a try.  The restaurant itself has a fair bit of seating available with one long counter encompassing both where you order and where your food is prepared. I went for a coney dog and water and within a few minutes my food was ready and it was time to dig in. The hot dog had a lot of very nice tasting meaty chilli on it, the combination of the chilli mixed with the mustard was nice and the sausage itself tasted good. This was a skinless sausage on a regular seedless bun. There were a lot of diced onions on top that added to the mix. Overall this was an excellent combination of ingredients and a very satisfying hot dog.   If I had to complain about anything it's that it was a tad pricey, it was a little over 4.00 for the hot dog and a cup of water. I will say that this was a far better tasting hot dog with chilli as the primary ingredient than the one I had at Ted's also located in Tempe Arizona, but for the same price roughly I got a footlong there. Overall I'd say my food was excellent but the value was a little lacking. I am going to give Detroit Coney Grill a solid four stars and a recommendation.

As the Chicago area hot dog critic one thing I've noticed is that when traveling to other metropolitan areas hot dogs aren't nearly as popular other places as they are in Chicagoland. I did a search for hot dog stands near where I'm staying during my trip to the Phoenix Arizona area and found a place called "Ted's Hot Dogs" and the next closest place was immediately familiar. It was Portillo's, a very popular and abundant chain started in suburban Chicago that has apparently made its way to Arizona.  I finally had a chance to stop by and the first thing that I noticed is that it's every bit as busy as the Chicagoland locations. The parking lot was completely packed and there was very little available seating inside. There were also tables outside, but people had birds coming up to their tables,sometimes managing to get away with a french fry before fluttering off.    Now, I've been to the Chicago area Portillo's many times and have reviewed a few locations. As a child I met Dick Portillo on a number of occasions and used to be a very big fan of Portillo's as a chain. Over the years, the quality control at Portillo's has diminished. The same quality ingredients are being used, but it seems like the training on how to properly assemble hot dogs, burgers, and everything else has suffered. Or management has simply stopped paying as vigorous attention to quality control. With a location over a thousand miles from Chicagoland I wondered if the menu would be different, if the way things were made would be different, and if being so far away the same degradation in food preparation that has infected the Chicagoland locations was present here.  Upon walking in and looking around it sure looked and felt like a Portillo's. I didn't thoroughly inspect the menu as my order was taken while in line by a lady who wrote it down on the back of a bag, it appeared to be the same as the Chicago locations. I placed my order, and then got into the pick-up line to wait for my food. One trend I've noticed at the Chicago locations is repeated rhymes based on your order number. So they would call out things like "Number two, your order is due", "Number three come see me". I noticed with certain numbers they were doing the rhyming as well (this must be something they train on), but it wasn't the constant irritation of hearing it at the Chicagoland locatons to the point where you're trapped in a Dr. Seuss book.  Finally my food was ready and I struggled to find an open seat without subjecting myself to eating outside where birds interrupting my meal was nearly a certainty. I finally sat down took my food out and snapped a picture. This was a regular Portillo's hot dog. The problem is we had the same inconsistent preparation we see at the Chicago area locations.  For any of those reading this review that are unfamiliar with what a Chicago style hot dog should be, I'll go over the basics. A Chicago style hot dog has a few different variations. The version served by Portillo's is the most traditional style which is an all-beef natural casing sausage. The natural casing is skin that when properly heated will give the frankfurter a nice bit of resistance and a snap when you bite into it. The classic Chicago style hot dog comes on a poppy seed bun which has been steamed to become soft and easy to bite into. It has a pickle spear or slice, tomato slice, sport peppers, bright green relish mustard, onion and celery salt on it. Ketchup is considered to be the worst possible addition to a Chicago-style hot dog as the sweetness overpowers the flavor of the other ingredients.  So how did the Portillo's of Tempe hot dog fare? The sausage itself was fine, but the relish application was a bit excessive. This added to the biggest problem,  the bun was steamed  too much along with being causing it to become a tad soggy. As a result the back half of the hot dog dissolved as I picked it up forcing me to struggle to finish the rest without getting my hands wet and sticky. The taste of the hot dog was roughly on par with other Portillo's, the big problem being a bit too thick of a pickle spear.   I also got fries with cheese sauce. These fries were a litle over cooked, I'd say they were crispy but a few were so crisp there was no potato paste to be extracted from the inside.   My overall impression is that this isn't any worse than the Chicago area Portillo's on any given day. But Portillo's food quality isn't what it used to be either. I did notice quite a few people at this Portillo's with Chicago themed shirts, Bears and Bulls jerseys. While I'm sure Chicago transplants and visitors only make up a small fraction of their clientele, it struck me as interesting. This is especially true since there doesn't seem to be a lot of other Chicago themed eateries around the area. Overall, I'm going to give my Portillo's experience here two stars. But for the Phoenix area readers your mileage may vary as its unique to the area.
