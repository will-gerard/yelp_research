Average Sushi. Can't pinpoint what, but something was missing from it.  We had the Philly roll and Cali roll. Def not the best I've ever had. And the Edamame had a weird smell/taste to it. Like it had been either sitting around or over cooked. Pretty sure I won't be going back. Oh, and they charge you a 5% sushi tax.  Not sure what that for but I saw abut her reviewer mentioned it too.

This is the worst place for delivery!  They put you on hold for close to 5 min when you call, then it takes well over an hour to deliver the food (we live less than 5 miles away). The food is decent but not worth the hassle of having it delivered.

I've been treated here by Doug twice-once for lot lower back and again for my hip. I had the best experience and highly recommend him and the other PT's! He is very knowledgable about how the body works, takes the time to really listen and figure out what's wrong and how he can get you back to doing the activities you are missing out on. He spends the time with each client getting to know you in a personal level too which is one reason I keep coming back. He makes himself available via email throughout your rehab as well as after which is very helpful. The entire staff is super friendly and the space is really clean. I moved a little south but still make the 20 min drive up here to see Doug. He's worth the drive!

How do we get them to STOP calling!  It's been 6 years and 3 cars ago when I used them and they call me weekly and will NOT stop calling no matter how many times you ask them to take you off their calling lists.
