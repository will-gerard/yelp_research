I went in on a Tuesday and got their special: Turkey Rellano, it was delicious. They use local small business' for their bread, coffee and much more. Those iced coffee is amazing will regularly getting that in the morning!   The staff was friendly and truly cared about how your meal was. Definitely a hidden little gem.

Love this place. A great place to catch up with girlfriends. Also their bruschetta and salads top anywhere else I have been.

Came in a while ago and it was great came in again this past weekend and looked like all new staff. Our waitress took 30 min to get our drink order. Meanwhile she took two tables who sat down after us their drinks and food order before our drink order. We were her only three tables. After that it took her another 30 min to get our food order then never came to check on us we had to ask three times for the check and a box. After this past experience I probably won't come back.
