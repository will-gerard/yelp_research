This was our second venture to this joint: the first time was a disaster as we didn't even get noticed once so no food or drink was to be had. The staff gets perfect marks for ignoring us, This time the joint wasn't to busy so figured we would have a decent chance at getting service. Well we sort of got service from a staff member who seemed annoyed we bothered her to order. The drinks were slow to come out and for beer it wasn't very cold. Before we could ask for waters our server ran away. We did finally order "food" the curry wings looked like a pile of gooey vomit and didn't taste much better. There were three of us at the table, each regretfully had one wing and shoved the rest to the side. I ordered the Halo burger which had a crisp cheddar ring around it which was the best part. The burger itself was something straight from the freezer, pre-made greasy as all can be. No flavor and the condiments that came with the burger were the standard fare. The steak fries as a side should have stayed in the kitchen. They were underdone and soggy. No flavor either. My wife ordered the french dip, something that usually you can't screw up. Well these guys at G&D are batting 1000 with subpar food, I've tasted better french dips at hospital cafeterias. Our friend ordered the Reuben grinder, he said it was OK, but again the fries stayed on the plate. Our wait staff was non existent. She never bothered to check on us once. We had to stand up to show that we were ready for our check...that really didn't work so our friend had to track her down. Plan to ask for your check well ahead of time as they do not value your time. I guess we are the idiots for trying the place again but really you might get em on a bad day so give them the benefit of the doubt and try em again. Well twice was WAY more than I will be spending there. I know they have a lot of regulars and maybe these folks are fine with the usual horrible AZ customer service and crappy food. I for one, coming from Chandler, like to enjoy a decent meal. We didn't order anything complex yet this joint managed to make even a simple burger just plain bad.

Always great service with super friendly staff. We usually see with Dr. Knott or Dr. Sale I and both are fantastic! Always caring, never trying to sell you services your pet doesn't need. The front end staff are terrific and very accommodating. The techs are helpful as always. We've been going to Oasis for over 10 years now!

Why would you print doors open at 7pm and here we are waiting at 820 to get in. Another sucky arrogant waste of a time Scottsdale shithole. I won't be spending money on drinks here. Give me a tap water. You don't deserve a dime from anyone

E & J were very quick to contact me to set up a visit to look at our failing fridge. I knew it was going to be something either really easy or really expensive. Ernie showed up within the time frame (on the early side of it) and quickly got down to business. He quickly diagnosed the problem and informed us we would be better off getting a new unit based the part that would need to be replaced. I can't appreciate that enough. So many times mechanics and so on get you in a hard spot or diagnose things you have no idea what they are talking about. Ernie showed me exactly what and where the problem was (sealed system leak) and referred me to a local appliance business whom we have done business with in the past. I would highly recommend these folks for your repair needs. I felt confident hiring these guys based on other Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Thanks again E & J

Ha ha......we waited and waited and waited. Finally ordered food. Waited much longer then asked if we wanted our tab-uh still haven't got the food! Wow maybe the food is good but I wouldn't know. Slowest place hands down.

We used to enjoy Zipp's for the food primarily. The atmosphere is something you just dealt with:it's always loud with TV's blasting some game. Ok fine, it's a sports bar. Our last trip (and it will be our last trip) was disappointing on all account. We ordered the wings this time since our former favorite cheese sticks have been less than stellar the past two visits. The wings were decent enough. We should've stopped there. We both ordered burgers, medium, with fries and onion rings. The burger had zero flavor, not even a hint of seasoning. They were well done, greasy and just not good. The fries and onion rings were the biggest disaster-a pile of something may have been crispy at some point during the day but was served as a batch of greasy crumbles. Greasy doesn't even describe how bad they were. I don't know if their fryer wasn't hot enough or clean enough. Or both. You'd think they would be embarrassed plating something that horrible looking but clearly they don't care. Based on our past two experiences there we will not be back. It's too bad, they used to be good. They may survive for a little while on the backs of regulars but ultimately this level of quality will catch up with them.

Worst, slow service ever....especially with almost no one in the place. Food was average at best and thats being kind. Skip it if you are looking to eat or get a drink.  Just an update: I (as well as a friend who wrote a review of the day) were contacted (I didn't see my message until today oops) and offered refunds and gift certificates. Now this seems all well and fine-I do appreciate them trying to make the most of the situation-but my friend is still waiting for a refund and/or certificate. So we shall see. If I could take away my star for more non-service then I would.

A real great place, friendly staff who make you feel at ease while getting your artwork done. I have been to other tattoo joints and usually feel out of place. Not here! The work was quick and turned out great. I can't wait to reccommend my friends to check out this joint. And the price was great. Can't say enough good things about the place. Thanks guys...next I might have to try the barber side and get a pint of High life!

We stopped by here prior to The Who concert to get a couple of drinks and a bite to eat. The place wasn't to busy yet so we thought it would be perfect being so close to the arena. We were seated outside and asked about drink specials, which we were told there were no specials despite the sign hanging right by us stating otherwise. The hostess came and took the sign down...classy. We ordered some appetizers consisting of hot wings, which were not hot and they could not split favors. That was beyond them to do that. The wings were deep fried to the point of being dried and taking on a jerky like consistency. We also ordered some onion rings, which ran $10 for a plate. These were not your hand battered good onion rings-they were straight from the bag frozen and done in two seconds. The ranch dressing served with the wings and rings was about as thick as water and didn't taste much better.   We decided to order a couple of sandwiches, which we figured would be a huge mistake but we were hungry. My wife ordered a club in "Texas toast" and I ordered a half pound bacon and blue burger. I kid you not the order came out as soon as the waitress put it in. There is no way this was cooked to order. The menu said burgers are cooked medium, mine was super well done with no hint of juice. I have no idea at what point the meat weighed half a pound because the "meat" I got was something McDonalds wouldn't serve. My wife's Texas toast was nothing more than regular dry toast. Pints of beer are no cheaper here than inside the arena. The bottom line....go somewhere else when going to an event here or go inside and eat. There's no pride in the cafeteria food they serve. I can only think that they stay in business since on event days they are bound to get a few suckers in there that haven't tried it before. It's to bad having a great spot and all. The valley is loaded with fantastic Irish pubs and this joint should be embarrassed to even consider themselves one. I hope one day this spot is taken over by someone who actually takes pride in what they serve, even on the busiest of days. A busy event should not be an excuse to serve garbage.

Great quick service. Very honest....the service guy recommended three tires I asked about just doing all four but he said the other one is in good shape with good tread (it was about a year old with little driving on it). I'd recommended these guys to anyone. Good price and fast.

We went here after seeing a story in the Chandler Republic about that shopping center. Figured after a movie it would be great to check out a local joint. And burgers-can't go wrong! Well you can go wrong. Really wrong. There was no welcome by the teens working. Ok fine, we ordered basically the same burgers but for some reason the girl offered my wife a combo deal but not me. Uh ok. This was after she had to make sure they had burgers! Really? Maybe call it Mikes cheesesteak and sometimes burgers. We placed the order-$25 for two burgers and fries. So my expectations were high. I'll pay good money for a good burger. This is a Friday night and there was no one in there. We sat at our dirty booth for over 20 minutes for the food. When it came I had well over done onion rings and my wife had half cooked fries with her meal. Ok so sides are not your main thing here fine. On to the "burger" waiting that long one would expect something glorious. But you're given this thin patty (they claim 1/3 pound but McDonald's has bigger patties) that's on a super dry bun. In fact I've never had a burger so dry in my life. Thank god we had a drink at the table to choke it down. They cooked every bit of goodness out of that burger and then longer. It tasted weird as well. I question the freshness. I'll update this if I get sick. What we should've done is just donated $25 to this place and went to a real burger joint. There are tons of them around so you'd think this place would keep up with that to make a good name for itself. But there's no effort, no passion. It's just a bunch of over cooked meat placed on dry buns. We gave it try...support a local business but they failed us. We won't be back. Excuse me while I get some water, my mouth is still dry from those hockey pucks.

I'm only taking one star off because of a couple of things....it was pretty hot along the course, the amount of fog from the fog machines was annoying and almost choking and the sad looking animontronics. Other than that the gift shop was cool and full of cool memorabilia, the course had some cool items to golf around. The staff was great, which is rare in Vegas it seems even though its a service based city. Where a KISS shirt and you are treated like royalty! Our group of four had a blast, perfect way to kick off the day and shake off the hangover.

Where to begin....we finally made it to this joint on an event night for beer week. It was nice to see the place packed on a Thursday. The service was prompt and our waiter checked on us a lot even for as busy as it was. The food....wow! Talk about taking some run of the mill items and reinventing them in such a great way! We got a variety of items to try/share. Word to the wise:the portions are quite big. Not some tiny hipster plates that barely touch your appetite. The warm meat platter was amazing. A variety of sausages and sauces that were all spot on. A great way to start off with the amazing selection of pints. Our platter didn't come out right away as it got lost in the shuffle, but our waiter was more than apologetic so I can't really fault them on such a busy night. We also tried the Churchill grilled cheese with spam as an add-on. I can't wait to have this again! We used to have this in Minnesota a lot, but the high quality cheeses they use and bread really make this an amazing dish. My friend had the Nutter Fluffer with bacon add-on. Nutella, bananas, bacon, peanut butter, marshmallow cream. I'm probably missing a couple of items but man was this done right. Every bite was an adventure as each flavor came out. My wife got the mash tacos (I forget the exact name) mashed sweet potatoes, cheese, pesto in a fried shell. More of a quesadilla than taco but again....simply amazing. It's one of those menus you look at and think, "how would that go together?" Well it does. Can't wait to get back and try so e more items and beers.

What a disappointment. Started off well enough being greeted straight away but that's about it. The waitress didn't offer up any hints on the beer. Usually you go to a brewery and they tell about each beer with pride. Not here. Basically here's our board of beers have fun. Then the food. I assume they are just starting to search stuff but on styrofoam plates? And wrapped plastic wear? Wow classy. We ordered the pretzel appetizer which is just the same over salted pretzels you get at the movies or ball game. Nothing special there...and pretzels are easy to make from scratch. I had the pastrami sandwich which was lukewarm and pretty bland. You get a cup of some kind of sauce or soup, no one explains anything here, and a bag of Lays plain ol chips. My wife order a pizza with bacon which was around have rage and again lukewarm. Blah.  Service is just bad. After we placed our order we were never checked on again. I had to go to the bar and get our check. NOW if you are a regular of this place it appears as if one could expect stellar service. New customers need not come in. It's too bad, we were looking forward to trying the place. And with a limited amount of restaurants that are actually open downtown Mesa, you'd think it would be easy to shine. It's just not the case.

We were really looking forward to checking this place out before a concert on a Friday night. We arrived around 530 and it was not to busy so we figured that would help us get in and out fairly quickly. No one greeted us so we were kind of lost as to was it open seating or wait to be seated. After a couple minutes of looking lost we were told we could sit any where. A few minutes later I grabbed a couple menus from the counter to see what they had to offer. The waiter did finally show up did not offer any specials or really explain anything. Using a Living Social voucher we each got a glass of wine and a "melt" the wine was decent enough. The melt was well strange. It really was just a whole bunch of cheese melted on a doughy flat bread with a few pieces of sausage on it. We did order a couple of other food items as well. The other melt had pear and a balsamic reduction on it. This offered a bit more flavor and was decent enough. We were really looking forward to the baked avocados. Its an avocado split in half and filled with onions and corn and a few other non-descript items. The whole thing was rolled in panko and baked. Well it tasted like exactly what it was named: a baked avocado. No other flavor at all. In fact it was almost bizarre having that warm mushy avocado texture and not much else. Needless to say the whole outing left us disappointed. It's one of those places that online it seems great and then you go there and its nothing like what you expected. It's fine if you do not want a busy place or quick service. But I'd skip it and hit a more well known joint like Postinos.

Man...what potential. We stopped by before Black Sabbath since KDKB was doing a remote and contest for front row seats. There was also a diamondbacks game that night as well....as you may know that's quite busy for downtown. We stayed on the patio since it was nice out. As far as we could tell there was only one server for the entire area. I really felt bad for this girl. She was busting her butt trying to serve people but the frustration showed and I don't blame her. How could management staff a place like that? Maybe they had a number of call outs or no shows that day who knows. But it was bad. We got some happy hour food which took forever and a day to get. The bacon wrapped shrimp seemed pretty good. You get four decent sized shrimp wrapped in bacon and a decent sauce. Only half my shrimp had bacon wrapped on them, but hey who's counting. And I wasn't going to make that poor waitress more miserable. The nachos looked good enough, I didn't try them but how can you screw them up? We should've thought ahead and saved that server time and helped her by ordering say four drinks at a time. The time we spent there, over an hour, we were only able to order one drink each. And that was a stretch. My friends got their beers and ten minutes later I got my greyhound. Again....this has nothing to do with the server! She was really trying. I blame management for not taking advantage of double events that night AND a radio station on site. It shouldn't be that hard. The place seemed like it would be good and maybe on a non-event day I would go to see if that's true. If you go on event days just plan on waiting.....eating with your hands since you apparently get no napkins or dinnerware and flagging down the food runner who is asking every table if the food is their order. We watched it go by a few times and thought wow.....these guys are so disorganized. Legends.....in bad management.

After hearing the hype we decided to give this place a try on a rainy afternoon. The place was packed (which meant little parking and a 40 min wait) which is fine because that tells me there's probably something good happening there. We were seated and the first thing you notice is don't bother talking to anyone in your group. It's very loud in there so you just kind of sit there pointing at things. We had a group of six and all ordered various beers. I can't anyone was blown away by the flavor. Red Rocket was ok, the sour beer was ok, the double IPA was horrible, wet barrel barley wine was alright. Basically the beers could've been brewed anywhere, nothing really impressive.   We did order food because originally we were going to stay awhile. Service was fine so I can't complain there. But after being annoyed with the noise level and the lackluster beer it was apparent we were just gonna have a round, try some apps and move on. One friend ordered just fries. They had decent flavor but were a soggy, messy pile that just didn't look to good. The artichoke dip had a weird bitterness to it, like they dropped vinegar in the batch and hoped no one would notice. The pretzel sticks were good but the "beer cheese sauce" served with it was some weird, watery, sour foul tasting liquid that ruined anything it came into contact with. Skip the beer cheese anything. The wings were decent enough, meaty and flavorful. And the jalapeño sliders were good. (That lead me to believe perhaps the burgers are good there?)   All in all, it was a disappointing trip. The six of us all had been looking forward to the joint then the big letdown. I don't know if we even were in there for as long as we waited. I know the place will do just fine and I'm excited to see what they have up their sleeves for new beers. Just some tweaking here and there and it will be THE place to be in Gilbert.
