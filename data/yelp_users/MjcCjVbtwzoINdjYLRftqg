I had a friend in town that was looking for a unique bookstore, so I immediately thought of the Poisoned Pen. After realizing that the store did not carry what my friend was interested in we decided to check-out.  I have been a resident of Arizona and Scottsdale for almost 20 years so I love to collect non-fiction books about my state and city. While we were checking out I was greeted with a snickering comment by your "cashier/owner"....."Tourist" Even if I WAS a tourist, I am giving my hard-earned dollars to local businesses such as yours...so what does it matter what I am buying?? You are getting your money either way. I am embarrassed to have recommended your "shop" to my friend. And bad reviews get passed on 10X more than good reviews...

I have been looking forward to dining here since they opened and have seen my friend's rave reviews. Finally got the chance on October 15th for my belated birthday dinner with my beau. Everything was perfection! We were seated right away for our 8:30pm reservation. We were sat at a roomy booth which was perfect for my BF to finish up some work on his laptop. Our server Luci was great! It was her 1st night serving on her own (without a trainer) and she was a gem! Very knowledgeable about the wine and food menu. Fabulous job Luci!  We shared the Smoked Norwegian Salmon appetizer, I had the Roasted Rosemary Chicken with cauliflower "polenta" and brussels sprouts and my BF had the Korean Style Skirt Steak. It was all wonderful! We shared the German Chocolate Flourless Cake, which was just OK (I wasn't expecting it to be spectacular without flour...the BF has to eat gluten-free, though) and Salted Caramel Ice Cream...delish! Also had 2 specialty coffees with dessert.  A wonderful dining experience from start to finish and added to our "Favorite Restaurants" list!

We live across the street from Hula's and are always looking for good late-night food. Came in last week for the 1st time. Unfortunately, we were in a hurry because we had a movie to catch. Our server (Charlie?) was great, we put in our order right away and had our dinner in less than 10 minutes. I had the Cajun Burger, which was cooked a perfect medium rare and delicious, and my BF had the Mongolian Beef Bowl which he enjoyed as well.  We have been back twice since then when we had more time to sit and enjoy our meals!
