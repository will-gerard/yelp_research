I'm giving this place a 2 because I really like sitting on the patio, it's very cute and quaint. The inside is usually too cold. Drinks aren't bad. I don't go for sugary drinks though.   I DO NOT LIKE  that I couldn't settle down at a table or wait for a friend to arrive or wait for a long line to shorten before someone came over and hounded me to buy a drink. (They are known for this! ) I'm not here with an electronic, I have a book or nothing because I'm meeting a friend, so obviously I'm not trying to mooch off the wifi.   The staff for the most part are pretty rude to me at least. I don't think I was difficult, give me a plain coffee or iced coffee that's it. Saw them being nice to other customers so I tried talking to them too. They were pretty short with me and didn't really give eye contact. I wish I could remember a name of a worker there because he was the only one who was ever nice to me. I haven't been there in a few years for these reasons.

A few workers are nice and understanding. For some reason my drinks and food are always forgotten or they come out after the 3-7 customers that were behind me. Don't know if everyone else has this problem. Only go here still because I live right next door and it's on my way to the highway.

My boyfriend and I have been coming here for about 3 years now. We live down the street so we're always there. Love the food(especially the fish n' chips) and the atmosphere. The patio is so nice, when the weather is good. It's a cute and cozy place.   I read reviews about service being slow and not that great......? Sorry, we must have been taking up the staff's time. We like to talk to them because all of them are awesome! They were super nice and attentive even before they got to know us. Also, I don't like being hounded by staff at a restaurant. Go to Europe and experience dining there( I know it sounds pretentious) but you actually have time to really enjoy your company and food without feeling rushed.   I recommend this place if you want a chill time. Friday nights are fun too because there is dueling pianos and the place gets busy and everyone is singing. Sometimes they have live music on Saturday nights as well.
