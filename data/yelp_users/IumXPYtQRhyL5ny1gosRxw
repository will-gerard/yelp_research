I ABSOLUTELY recommend them. I have worked with this company for years for my event, Relay for Life at ASU. They have been the best vendor I have worked with in all my years of event planning. Bob and his brother are literally the nicest guys to work with, have never ONCE price gouged me and I constantly recommend them.

My boyfriend and I went to eat here a few days ago, the food was amazing, the service was so friendly but we both actually wound up getting food poisoning and it ruined our two year anniversary plans. Although the food may taste good, BEWARE! You may regret it later....we will never be returning.

I always say that Rita is like my own personal fairy godmother (which is funny that another review thinks that too!) Every time I walk through her door and put a dress on, she makes me feel gorgeous. Not only do her dresses fit like a glove, she will go on and on about how beautiful you are (which is necessary when you are standing in front of a mirror staring and poking at yourself) She even once worked overnight, and stayed open past hours in order for a fellow bridesmaid in a wedding to get her dress fixed. Hers got so botched from going to someone else that she didn't even have enough room to walk in it. Rita didnt even hesitate to wait for her to get there and had it ready in the morning. Never go to anyone else. Rita is AMAZING and also has GREAT prices.

I have been going to Cindy, one of the owners for years now and she is literally a genius. Never skip the blowout with her because every time I step out her door I leave feeling like a goddess. She's incredible and so much fun and is always trying to help in any way she can. I have referred several of my friends to her and she is amazing with all different hair types.

How this place doesn't have 5 stars is BEYOND ME. This place has literally changed my life. For years I suffered with food allergies that caused extreme pain, nausea and extreme weight loss. It was later diagnosed by another doctor that I had a gluten intolerance and possibly Celiac Disease (it's a real thing, not just something people do to loose weight) I also have been lactose intolerant my whole life. So much so that my mother had to feed me lactose free formula as a baby! Like a lot of people, I was skeptical about something that claimed they could heal you of something you had been suffering all your life with but I figured it couldn't hurt. I was referred by several friends (so I'm not the only one who loves this place) and I'm so glad I went. I was eating a restricted diet for years and now I can eat WHATEVER I WANT!!! Doctor Foster almost died when I told him the first thing I was doing after treatment was going to get a Krispy Kreme but I missed them so much and I ate it with no problem! Now, I can live my life without worrying about what I can and cannot eat. My quality of life after seeing Dr. Foster has improved tenfold. Please don't be too skeptical to try it! They also will continue to treat you for your allergy until it works if the first treatment doesn't work for you (which is rare) so you really have nothing to lose!

I recently went to sell clothes at this location, I have been selling my used clothes for years so I know what to expect. When I walked in, nobody paid any attention to me. They were all texting behind the counter. Once someone finally decided to notice me. She shoved a piece of paper in front of me and told me to fill it out. No manners, no welcome, or please or thank you. As I was waiting for them to go through my clothes, they were making fun of the clothes I brought in literally three feet in front of me. How rude! If you don't like them, just pass on them, don't call other people over to make fun of them. In the meantime, another person behind the counter was talking trash about something another person brought in and showed photos on his phone of it to another employee. Also within the 25 minutes I was there, an employee walked in needing to pick up her check and started crying when she found out the manager hadn't signed it yet so during my buy everyone was making calls to the manager and other employees. When I asked a very simple question about how pricing works, the employee I asked said nothing to me but shouted with an attitude across the back to someone else to "explain pricing to this girl"...like I'm incompetent. All in all everyone was super rude and I was really offended by the employees. They should put down their iPhones and Starbucks and get some customer service training.
