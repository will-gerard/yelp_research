Just got my hair cut today and what a great experience. Charming building, Great cut at a terrific value. I got my hair cut a little shorter for the warmer weather and Patrick got it perfect. I was on a break from work and time was critical. I was in and out and most importantly got a shampoo after the cut so wouldn't have hair down my shirt! Saving the best for last...shoulder and back massage afterward, then on my way back to work much more relaxed. Top notch salon. I highly recommend it!

My mother is new to Mesa so I brought her Downtown for a mani/pedi. All in all a great experience. Friendly staff. Nail stylist did a great job. A bit pricey for the area but worth a try.

Stopped in at the last minute with no reservation. They had a big bridal party on the patio but we were seated right away. Service was great. Food was very good with ample serving size. The bartender made a really good wine bottle recommendation that was spot on. Just an all around great experience. The chef even came out and said hello.

On a not so busy Wednesday night we (party of four) were seated right away. No server approached us for 10 minutes, not even a busser or hostess bringing water.  We went back the front desk to ask for help. When a server finally arrived she apologized for being the bathroom. Why would the hostess seat us in a server's area who was on break? We came primarily for the beer and they were out of seasonal/specialty beers. Disappointed, I settled for the Marzen which was fine. From that point service was fine. I was looking forward to the Farmhouse Burger with Bacon Jam and fried egg. I ordered Medium and got very well done. Same with my wife. There was no evidence of bacon jam. The burger had very little flavor (probably for being overdone)

Food, Service, and drinks are all top notch. I love spicy food and Los Dos delivers. My wife doesn't like it as spicy and there are options for her...Flautas! You MUST have the Adobada Ribs if you love intense heat WITH flavor. Kick Ass Margerita is great but I opt for the house Margo with a shot of one of their hundred tequilas...Cuervo Tres Generations for me. Anyway, you can get in and out quickly or stay for hours, relax, and enjoy! Cheers to John & John and the staff!

Every third Monday is Mani/Pedi day for my wife and mother. This salon is consistently top notch in every aspect. Friendly, prompt, courteous, and very high quality. All the staff is great but Susan and Sabrina are our favorites. Every pedi chair has a built in massager so its like a whole spa day....bring your wine~!

This review is only for the Alma In-N-Out. I don't eat much fast food but when I do, In-N-Out is my go to....healthIER and fresher. I've been an In-N-Out customer for 37 years (since I got my own car). This In-N-Out though always has the longest lines (I think it is due to the incredibly slow service) which isn't the worst part. I got a piece of beef jerky in my burger! (my poetic license) It was the thinnest burger patty I have seen in my life (literally) most likely because of being way overdone (hence the long wait?) I should have complained to a manager but did not actually see my jerky patty until I got home. I stick to the Stapley location now.

I was really looking for some authentic Mexican, but because of time and location had to settle. I knew better but went in anyway. The restaurant was not busy but service was a little off. My wife and I were seated at a table too small for my children. We had a craving for margaritas and shared a pitcher. It was good. Nothing else was. The salsa was bland like ketchup and we asked for an extra Jalapeno and never got it. The "Flautas" rolled in flour tortillas were corn taquitos. The Green Chile Pork Chimi was filled with flavorless stew meat and was soggy. Had we not enjoyed our margaritas we probably would have not eaten and gone to Taco Bell. This is probably a good restaurant for Snow Birds with no palate, but for true Southwesterners it was horrible.

I have never done yoga before but consider myself relatively fit (for 50!) Izzy was a great instructor and let us all move at our own pace. I was surprised at what I could accomplish with her guidance. Most importantly I felt amazing the rest of the day and can't wait for my next session. Great studio and great team!

This has become our regular Sunday Night fix. Great Tacos, I recommend the Chile Verde. Great margarita, chips & salsa...what else can you ask for? Service is competent and friendly. Have tried other dishes which are great, but the tacos I crave!  P.S. ask for the hot green salsa!

Hooray Beer! Finally Mesa has its own Brewery.  Fun place, great staff, and delicious beers. Quite a variety of beers. No food service but they have food trucks and you can order from local restaurants for delivery.

Finally open! The first great (New) Mexican food in Gilbert! Pretty busy for a Monday night but the staff handled it well. Food was really good, especially the roast red chile salsa! Margaritas very good and what a great selection of tequilas. Top notch all around. Will be back on a regular basis.

Went back again. I just don't understand the reviews about "too hot" or "not New Mexican" New Mexican cuisine is supposed to be spicy as opposed to "Mexico City" cuisine such as La Parilla Suiza. This is great flavorful, and spicy food. There are non-spicy options, but the spice is what I love. Great food, great service...and an incredible selection of Tequilas. Just a great place and I love it.

Wow, deliciously different. Made a bit of sampler platter with my wife. Tried 8 different empanadas...all delicious, but the Boricua and El Capitan were my favorites....primarily for being so different and complex. Great melange of flavors. Loved the spicy green sauce they give you on the side. The restaurant is very clean, great, friendly and efficient staff. They are very helpful explaining the different ingredients. Great addition to Downtown.
