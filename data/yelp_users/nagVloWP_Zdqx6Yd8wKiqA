Being in the mood for some Mexican food and wanting to try something local and close to where I lived, figured we give this place a try. Service was good place was clean and friendly but food could have been better. I had ordered the Sopapillia plate with ground beef. The Spanish style rice seemed to be more like minute rice with the Spanish seasoning and my Sopapillia fell apart with the ground beef inside reminding me of the ground beef served at Taco Bell or some fast food chain. The ice tea was not good either tasted as if was made from tap water. I managed to make it through the meal while being constantly annoyed at the plates that my meal was served on as it is a hot plate siting inside another holding plate, but as I would eat it would shift out of the holding plate. The plates and the whole experience brought back memories of when I was younger high school/college student and I though Pancho's was great Mexican food. For the price I paid I have had better. You do however get chips and Sopapillia with every meal which were good.

This is my first review ...and usually I'm not one to write a review but after having my car washed and detailed by Scott   "Showcase Mobile Detailing Solutions" I had to give a review.     I was highly impressed with his professionalism in regards to returning my phone call to schedule an appointment when he said he would. He showed up early rather than late and did everything that he quoted he would do with attention to detail.  I have never had my car (07 MazdaSpeed3) professionally detailed before, I usually try to do it my self but it takes all day...I was in a time crunch due to plans for Memorial day weekend and just didn't have the time.  I purchased the Wash and Wax Detail and he was done with the car in about 1.5 to 2hrs. My car had never looked so good....no waiting in lines, no dirty rags being re-used on your car.  He even gave me pointers and was willing to educate me on other methods "ie clay bar" .  Will definitely use again and recommend to my friends.

Over priced and not great service.. And the restaurant wasn't busy. Others were sat after us and served food before us after are order was placed before theirs. The 5$ off coupon you get on the strip cannot be used for drinks and their happy hour times is not food.

I have eaten here at least 6 times so far and have never had a bad experience. Food is good, staff is friendly and the biscuits alone are well worth the visit. I usually end up getting the chicken fried chicken with two eggs over hard and a bowl  of grits. Reminds me of good ol' southern  breakfast.

Definitely a better place to try during happy hour. was not impressed with the dinner pricing.  Over priced and small rolls for the price compared to other sushi places.

Food taste just as good as the other locations. I have only had the KK which is filling and won't leave you hungry.  It comes with three piece chicken, two tasty waffles, a side of grits and two eggs with cheese and onions. I prefer my eggs without the onions and order my sweet tea..half sweet and half unsweetened as it can be a potent concoction if was straight up. I would also like to see if there is a way to cook the eggs with less oil or butter?  At all the locations it seem there eggs come out overly grease.   Other than the 1hr wait for this location due to it recent opening (2days prior) this place has good potential.
