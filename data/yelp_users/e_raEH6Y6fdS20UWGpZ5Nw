Wow.  So I've been hearing about this place for a while.  I always looked for it when I passed it on my way down Roosevelt but always seemed to miss it.  I practically smacked myself in the forehead when we arrived today.  I felt stupid, but then again, there are some places I just can't see until I plan to stop there.  It took some convincing to get my husband to give a place other than his favourite Joe's Diner a chance for a delicious (post hangover) brunch/breakfast a chance.  We got there a little early due to it being their last brunch weekend before summer and I am paranoid of crowds and hipsters.  We arrived and found ourselves seats under an umbrella in the shade.  We got some water from the cooler and perused the menu and specials.  After some deliberating (sunrise sandwich or holy puerco?) and discussion (welcome breakfast has no meat -- I need my protein at breakfast), he went with the special boudin breakfast and I got the holy puerco.  We both had fresh squeezed ojs and beignets.  It was worth it.  Dear goodness I have not tasted pork jowl cruncy bits like those ever (and their meat is provided by meat shop and shreiners!).  The combination of flavors on the puerco thing was just delicious.  And the hashbrowns were fresh and not too crispy and not overpowering and flavorful.  I kind of wanted some sour cream to go with the flavors and make them like a crunchy baked potato.  The beignets are not as fluffy as the ones I remember in New Orleans but definitely will satisfy this girls desire for fried dough.  They are yummy and powdered and you must be careful or the sugar will make you cough.  The honey is also oh so good.  The husband very much enjoyed his boudin special and it was gone very quickly.  He said it was all very tasty and he was glad we braved the heat for the opportunity to try the breakfast before it is gone.  We also got a hurricane to share at the very end.  It tastes like juice, or sunshine in a cup.  But it does pack a punch.  I felt that drink (the few sips I had) by the time we got back home.  And then I crashed in a delicious food coma.

My neighborhood Costco.  Regularly quite busy but plenty of parking, so you always find a spot somewhere.  You can find great deals on bulk items (though the rawhide I used to get for my dog isn't there anymore).  If you get there right when it opens the wait in lines isn't bad.  And it can be fairly easy to run in and grab just one or two items, which is what I almost always do.  The member gas station has been our favourite aspect and the main reason we got a membership.  We never fill up anywhere else.  Generally about 5 cents less than others nearby.

Ok, so this was really incredibly depressing.  We had heard such wonderful things about this place, and even really enjoyed mother's day brunch here.  BUT, when we went here last night for our anniversary dinner, it was incredibly lackluster.  the brie brulee was ok.  my husband's filet was very underwhelming (though the risotto was delicious), my pork was good, and the four berry tart was yummy.  The problem was that we could have spent that money somewhere else on an even better meal.  Having moved recently from San Francisco, we try to stop ourselves from over criticizing, but we've found some real gems in Phoenix.  Coup des Tartes is not one of them. :(

This is our local Petsmart and we love it.  The training classes have been great for our growing Aussie, the grooming salon LOVES him and he always comes out looking handsome and dashing.  So clean... until he comes home and runs in the dirt.  Sigh.  They also carry the food that he can eat as he has a poultry intolerance.  I'm looking forward to the day that he's an adult and I have more options than one or the other puppy lamb & rice.  Keep an eye on their sales, sometimes there are some great markdowns!

They were friendly and helpful.  We had just moved to town and were able to set up our AAA accounts and do our title & registration for the car.  We even walked out with a license plate!

All I can really say is that it's a family favorite.  My husband's family is completely addicted.  They all have their favorites.  I'm still working my way through the menu but the fried ice cream is always our go to dessert.  And the margaritas are a nice complement to any Mexican meal. :)

The best caesar salad i have ever had.  The scallops were tasty, but not as crispy as I like them.  My husband loved his steak.  The chocolate lava cake is amazing.  Instead of a little oozing chocolate, there was a lot of oozing chocolate.  And their house chantilly cream is to die for.  I could eat it alone, by the spoonful.

OMG.  This was amazing. I hardly remember what I ate in specifics (it was the day we made a transatlantic move) but my mouth is salivating just thinking about my return when we visit for a family wedding in the fall.  It was a Thursday for lunch. The restaurant was rather quiet, the service a little slow and it was HOT outside. I had a glass of wine to sip and enjoy and my husband decided to go with the onion soup just because. It's a French bistro, you have to. It was by far the best onion soup we've tasted. And we went to Paris last year for our anniversary.  Croquet monsieur was definitely the pick of the afternoon and amazing. The chocolate souffl√© was to die for and all I want to do is take that restaurant and relocate it to my new city in England.

Great dim sum for the valley, their sweet bbq pork buns are especially good.  Their shrimp based pieces are all very good as well, especially the one with shrimp, pork, and chive.  We love going with friends, but it's certainly something we treat ourselves to occassionally.

These ladies are fantastic.  And clearly in high demand.  I had to wait a few weeks to get a spring clean done on my house, but now we're on a bi weekly schedule.  It's heaven.  I have never seen my house so clean as it was after the spring clean visit.  I don't think it was that clean when we bought the house!  I look forward to their visits, they've befriended and love on my dog who adores them.  My husband loves it because we're no longer trying to force the issue of me not being gifted in the cleaning department (I can cook, do dishes, and laundry.. I can do some things!)  Some might say it's expensive but it's a fair price for good work.  They're great at their jobs and you certainly don't feel like you're taking advantage of someone.  We've been recommending their services to everyone we know ever since their first visit.  They're the best.

The long and the short.  Bob is awesome.  We recently moved to Phoenix and inherited Bob as our mechanic through my in laws (they gave us one of their cars).  Then that car got into an accident and the damage cost more than the car.  We needed a new one.  After all the stress of trying to find the right car in our budget, we found one.  We needed Bob to look it over before we agreed to buy it, and he was able to see us on the spot!  24 hours later the car was ours.  (Additionally, he's just an awesome person.  Be prepared to see lots of sweet cats around as he rescues them.)

This review is heightened by their selection of alcohol on tap.  I am a Magners kind of girl.  Therefore, this place makes me very happy.  We had dinner here last night, the food leaves much to be desired.  Not sure when they won best fish & chips, but they're not very good.  I'm looking forward to trying some other places.  Overall, I think Rula Bula is worth it for happy hour drinks and apps, but not for an actual meal.  It's not much like an actual Irish pub, which is depressing.  I love pubs, and this doesn't meet the mark.

Three words: NOT WORTH IT.  We went here with family friends after a recital at ASU (though just after the workday for us) to celebrate.  Finding a nice restaurant for a large group to eat at in Tempe that isn't filled with college students (who are inebriated) is difficult.  There are some, but cost always comes into play and so we ended up at Monti's.    The food was ... ok.  The bread was ok, my salad was ok, my meal was ok.  The service was terrible.  The waitress was incompetent.  I expected at an "institution" such as Monti's that I wouldn't have a waitress so incapable of taking simple instructions.  Or to know the very limited drinks list.  I mean, I ordered one of the only decent glasses of wine on their menu and she didn't know what I was saying.  It was ridiculous.   Clearly I expected better out of a restaurant with such a reputation.  I will not be returning as there are far better restaurants in the valley and Tempe to dine at (and steakhouses).

If you're looking for a nice dinner in Tempe, this is your location.  We had heard of it on various occasions but finally went with friends when they recommended it.  Everything was fantastic.  The service, the food, the drinks, the dessert.  It was one of the best meals I've had in the valley.  I am now obsessed with their house infused vanilla bourbon.  I want to keep it in my house and keep on seeking an excuse to go back to HoT for that very drink.  They have a beautiful outdoor dining area which is perfect if the weather is ideal.  We went on a humid and hot night and preferred to be in a/c.  Luckily with reservations that wasn't difficult to accommodate.

Best food experience yet.  Since we can't reasonably excuse a trip to Thomas Keller's The French Laundry, this was definitely a good way to experience his amazingness.  It was just SO good.  Better than our experience at L'Atelier and not as costly.  Service was great and I would certainly go back numerous times.  Definitely will make this a go-to on every Vegas trip here on out.

Loved my spa experience here.  Got a manicure while my sister in law got a pedicure.  We had the same technician so we got to both go to the room and she soaked her feet and relaxed in the massage chair while I got my nails done.  I went back the next morning for a facial.  I love my facials but always procrastinate in getting them done because I hate paying the cost.  But the basic european is only 125!  Most places in the bay (for a spa facial with extraction and microdermabrasion) cost upwards of 180 and beyond.  And I definitely got a facial in june that cost more than this one and was not as good.    And the robes!  Softest comfiest one I've ever worn.  I wanted to take it home with me.  The relaxation lounge can definitely get crowded when people are waiting for their appts.  I really enjoyed the facilities and if you get anything done, you get full use of the spa until 8pm and can go in and out.

We were not impressed by our experience here.  We were with a large group, all of whom got the seasonal discovery.  We did the smaller tasting and it was ok.  Both of us were not impressed with our main courses.  My halibut was dry and tasteless.  Husband got chicken and it was nothing amazing.  We did both enjoy our desserts though.  I had the tart selection and he got the sorbet and ice creams.  all yummy.  Definitely not a place we would go back to, though I think we might enjoy the main Joel Robuchon restaurant better.  The trendy haute style cuisine wasn't really our style.  Plus - we're from the bay so good restaurants are plentiful.  When I got to Vegas, I think I should experience something better than what I can go to in SF.

Every time I walk into this store it's different.  Which is fantastic.  I love that it's always changing (more likely that I'll find something new that I love!).  It's a great place to shop for hostess gifts, random little gifts, that hard to shop for MIL, your hipster guy friend, new babies, the friend who has everything or even white elephant.    Of course, I do sometimes end up falling in love with many items in the store and unfortunately that often ends up being one of the most expensive items.  I do wish sometimes that the items they carry weren't so pricey so that I could support this local small business and purchase some of those types of items.  But there are times where I see something I love, look at the price, and put it back.  And other days where I see something I love and have no qualms buying it.  But that usually doesn't include the shirt that's over 100$.  Always worth a peek, especially when on the hunt for a gift for the hard to shop for person.  OR if you need to send a husband shopping for a gift and he's not a pro at shopping for the lady, he can't go wrong here. :)

This is authentic Cornish Pasty.  We love having a little piece of England nearby.  English ales, English type soups, and the pasties.  Oh, and yes that sticky toffee pudding is a must order.  Go, you won't be disappointed.  And if it's your first time, sitting at the bar is a great idea so you can watch them create the pasties.  It's amazing.

Ok, so this place isn't my favorite dim sum ever (reigning title goes to Yank Sing in San Francisco).  But when I get that craving for some delicious carb focused dim sum, Phoenix Palace is where I go.  It's the best we know of in the valley to feed our fix and definitely affordable.  bbq pork buns are my favorite :)    So if you're looking for some good dim sum in the valley, head here, because you won't find better unless you head to SF or China.

Meh....  What Over Easy has going for it is that it's breakfast options are HUGE.  This was a good place for us to try because our brunch crew has someone who doesn't eat eggs at breakfast.  We need other options (otherwise it's always bread/carbs for her).  So it was on the table.  We went at 10:30 on a Saturday morning.  For a group of 4, no wait.  First impression good.  As we continue to sit, we grow uncomfortable with the fact that it's still morning and we're listening to heavy metal.  It's just not breakfast music to us.  Order drinks.  Drinks take a bit.  When they do arrive, one of the iced coffees is dripping and the waiter drips it all down my husband's arm.  I had attempted to draw the dripping glass to his attention before the drink/sleeve interaction but alas, iced coffee on the arm.  And no apology, just a bunch of napkins tossed onto the table.  Now there's some crabbiness.  We order our food.  We do a little table rearrangements because of the tv distraction for some.  I had the wolfpack which was decent.  Nothing amazing.  My eggs were a little on the hard side, not how I prefer them.  Husband had the hopple popple and wasn't enthused.  BIL had breakfast burrito and was pleased but didn't like the single pancake (quote: tastes like bisquick).  BIL's girlfriend had carmelized banana french toast and sourdough toast.  The french toast was rich and the sourdough burnt.  Iced coffee tasted extremely watered down.  I prefer the toddy at gallo blanco or what I make at home.  Hot coffee did not impress.  We probably won't be back.

This was a perfect date night after a horrible week of not seeing my husband due to his job.  We knew we wanted to go out for dinner and Breadfruit has been on my list of places to go since we moved here.  Finally, tonight was the night;  we decided to go.  We didn't have a reservation but went around 5:30.  Early dinners suit us. They seated us outside; tonight was perfect for it.  Around 80 degrees and amazing.  NO chill, just perfect and comfortable.  Rum punch so good! Scallops delicious (we shared them).  I had the lobster, he had the house special, red snapper.  We were both very happy with our meals.  The portions were perfect.  We love experiencing more flavors and high quality food over large portions.  I love leaving a meal not feeling stuffed, but perfect content.  This was that feeling.  All the drinks, which came recommended by our great server, were smooth and oh so good.  (the coconut bread pudding was also very yummy and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside; i wanted a little something like creme fraiche or a small bit of ice cream for it, but it was very good on it's own)  I would certainly return again, but it was definitely a splurge.  But a very happy splurge. :)

It is so dangerous that this place is less than a 5 minute drive from our house.  I also believe we fall into the delivery radius.  We finally tried Thai Basil out on the recommendation of my brow aesthetician and we are so glad we did.  We ordered the green curry and siamese fried rice and it is delicious.  I am so pumped to try more of their curries.  The fried rice is nice and fluffy and satay chicken with sauce is super yummy.  We can't wait to order from here again.

Went here over Christmas with some friends and it was so good.  The cheese and charcuterie plate is a fabulous idea (being able to pick what you want) and the food was all amazing.  we're definitely itching to go back again.  with the cheese and charcuterie plate, it's also a great option if you just want to go for a glass of wine and some snacks.  it is more than just an amazing meal, it's a place to relax and unwind!

This place is definitely a special treat, and was a splurge even with the restaurant week menu.  Of course with the supplements and a bottle of wine, it adds up fast.  My salad was delicious and light and flavorful.  The rotini with lobster was yummy, but too much pasta.  I ate all the lobster out of it though :P  And the strawberries and cream was amazing and we all wanted lick the plate clean.  So good!  Definitely a place to remember when we're looking for an amazing dinner out and are prepared to splurge.

OMG I love it.  Almost 2 years living in the Coronado and Phoenix and my life is empty without Americas burritos.  I've even told the husband that if we ever leave, Americas is the first place we stop at when we come back to visit (we have family here).  We have the joy of living a half mile walk away, and this is our neighborhood burrito joint.  Between the delicious salsa, carne asada burritos and the Mexican bottled sodas, my life is utterly complete!  (the margs are good as well as is the Cochata...mmmm)  When it's busy, the wait time usually isn't too bad because they're busting out food pretty quick, it the slow afternoons or weeknights that mean you can wait a little longer for take out.  That being said, eating in is always good especially with the happy hour specials or the refills on chips and salsa.  I'll be honest, if I'm having a crap day or didn't get to make dinner, this is what I want.  Their food and a good Mexican coke always makes my day better.

My love for America's remains, but went down a star for the inconsistency of the hours.  On more than one occasion in the past month we have arrived to find the restaurant closed in contradiction to business hours.  There has just been a printout on the door saying "we're closed please head to the Melrose location, mention this and get 20% off your order."  By the time I've been disappointed in my decision to choose a closed restaurant for my meal, I am certainly not interested in traveling to another location.  I want something close and convenient (like this location).  So now we're still fans, just only during weekdays, which seem to be the only days they're open.

We won't be returning to this place.  With a new puppy at home and diminished sleep, I purchased the Groupon for Second Home Pet Resort thinking we could use it and get some much needed sleep.  We got the sleep.  The puppy got diarrhea. :(  The facility itself is very nice.  Everything that you think your beloved pet will enjoy.  We returned to pick up our puppy 2 days later (first they attempted to charge us in full without the Groupon) to be informed that our pup was having some bathroom issues.  To which my response was, did you give him chicken?  Our pup has a poultry intolerance.  They asked me if I told them that.    While I'm quite sure it was repeated a few times about his sensitive stomach, I was blamed for their lack of knowledge.  I know I wrote it on his paperwork that they required I fill out.  Why did I fill it out if they weren't going to read it?  So while I know my puppy is the most loving and sweet boy, he will not be returning because no one apologized for his stomach pains and they blamed me.  It was incredibly unprofessional.  The customer is ALWAYS right.  It's just good business practice.

I cannot fully describe the amount which I love this place.  I mean, it's literally around the corner from my house, so it gets extra awesomeness for being so close!  They make the best Pimms No 1 cup here.  I LOVE it.  I'm picky about how mine taste and here it is divine.  They also have housemade lemonade and ginger ale, which makes the world a better place as well.  John is awesome.  We love him.  They have weekly desserts which is awesome.  Always based on seasonaility.    Also the menu just changed for the summer season.  We have yet to try the new items, but have heard from friends that it's amazing.   LOVE LOVE LOVE

As a family, we love the cakes here, but bad business practice has us refusing to patronize them any more.  My mother in law had a coupon to use and ordered a cake.  When she picked up the cake, she was told that she couldn't use the coupon, it was only for DECORATED cakes.  So she held onto it.  A friend's birthday came along and she thought it was the perfect opportunity to use the coupon -- she could get a decorated cake for her friend!  So she ordered a decorated cake.  And was told again that she could not use the coupon.  No real reason why, just that she couldn't.  Twice she spent good money at the location, and neither time would they honor the coupon.    And there was no attempt to make her happy.  I mean, it was a simple coupon.  It basically covered the cost the decoration.  Why not just give her the discount and keep the customer?  And the associate told her that it had happened to other people who were probably also unhappy.... then why hasn't anything been done to rectify the situation?  Disingenuous business practices lead to loss of customers.

Another Coronado neighborhood gem.  Love it here.  I'm currently finishing up my yoga tasting and can't wait to get back from vacation and throw myself in with a membership.  THe varied classes are amazing.  I think Meagan is my favorite instructor.  She has such a wonderful vibe, and she remembers your name.  For that matter, so does Rebecca (owner)!  I've tried yoga and pilates over the past few years, and nothing has given me the workout SuTRA gives me.  The barre pilates class is a dream and skullpt is incredible.  By the end of any class, my body has been worked but I feel amazing!  Usually when I leave the gym I don't feel amazing, just beat.  SuTRA is such a great boost.  Additionally they have various activities going on at the studio.  They have local artist artwork displayed and a little reception on their own version of first fridays.  Yogavin is coming up, and I can't wait to try it.  They also have massage therapy which I'm itching to utilize because summer in Phoenix is rough and stresses me out.    But if you come here, don't expect to do relaxing yoga, expect to sweat in the most amazing way possible :)

I love this place.    The first time I came in I was super nervous, and totally on the fence.  I was so freaked out about what I was getting myself into, but Tom helped me chill out and my assessment went pretty ok.  And then I started going to classes.  The workout will kick your ass, but in the best way possible.  The coaches and community here is great and I'm so happy I made it part of my life.  I just need to go more often! :)

This place is AMAZING.  Lesson learned: arrive early.  Call ahead and place an order.  Get on the mailing list.  There is nothing better than getting your meat from and English butcher.  I recently read that you should develop a good relationship with your butcher.  They know the meat inside and out, and can give you the best tips when in comes to preparing or ordering.  This is that kind of place.  And it's only about 7 minutes from my house!  We left with grass fed ground beef, grass fed patties, rashers, bacon (pork belly bacon... yum), 3 tbone steaks and a hunk of beef for roast beef.  We didn't find exactly what we were looking for because they were out and it was mid afternoon on a Saturday.  Their advice was the above "lesson learned".  This is the only place we'll be getting our meat from now on.  What's better than your very own grass fed butcher?  I can't think of much :)

I could easily eat here every night of the week.  We finally made our way to Gallo Blanco.  It's been on  my list to try for a while, especially with us living in the Coronado.  Locally run hotel, local restaurant, local sourcing of product, what isn't there to love?  NOTHING!   It was the perfect dinner back in town (I had been gone for a family wedding) with my husband.  Margarita Monday made it even better (a pitcher for 20 bucks).  The acapulco crudo was phenomenal (and I'm craving it right now), the guac deliciously fresh.  They serve breakfast all day and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his chilaquiles.  I had the famous street tacos: ahi tuna, cochinita, and carne asada.  All very good, the tuna being a fantastic special from the summer menu.  Yum!  Hubby had the orange cake which disappeared quickly.  I didn't even get a taste.  I had the postre de chocolate, which is basically smores in a cup and, oh man, that thing was delicious.  I savored every bite of it and couldn't finish it!  There was probably one bite left, but I just couldn't.  I absolutely can't wait to go back.  It's definitely one of my favourite mexican restaurants in the valley.

Yay!  This was a great dinner date with the husband.    The location is much bigger than it appears when driving past.  Same goes for the parking.  One of the reasons I had avoided coming in was worry about parking and size.  Not to worry, it was fine!  Husband was happy to get an italian beer, I was happy with a nice cocktail.  Our salads were delicious and very large (the small is perfect for one person for a meal, esp with meat).  Husband was very happy with his personal size pizza (happy hour for the win!).  Dessert was lovely; I loved the little donuts (cherry) with caramel sauce.  It was heavenly!  This is great place to come as a group or for a family outing since it's easy to do sharing.  A large salad could be a side for about 4-6 people, I would say.  The smaller version could cover about 3.  Certainly a place we'll recommend when the whole family is in town over Christmas and is looking for a place to eat.

After a horrible experience at Second Home Pet Resort, we were on the lookout for a new home for our pup while we were away.    Enter Tailwinds.  Conveniently only 2 minutes from our home in the Coronado, our friendly Aussie charmed his way on in, made tons of friends and didn't even want to come home!  My tired boy is feeling great (though napping) and we have no digestive inconveniences.  He's already looking forward to his next visit for Thanksgiving! He may even go back sooner if we end up going on a few little weekend trips between now and then.  Thanks Tailwinds for being awesome!  And the nightly all inclusive rate is great.  No worries about tons of add ons.  The staff is fabulous and all the dogs are so happy to be together!

I love Culver's.  I grew up in Wisconsin so Culver's is in my blood.  Before we moved here I had to visit my parents or my in laws to satisfy a Culver's craving, now they're all over the valley and we live in Phoenix now!  This Culver's had a rough start.  We came with friends in December and it was SLOW.  30 minute wait at least for our food.  February was a different story and everything arrived much more quickly.  My only recent complaint was that I ordered the flavor of the day custard "chocolate oreo volcano" (a family favorite).  And what it seems I actually received was 'oreo overload'.  I would double check on some of the servers' knowledge of what the flavor of the day ingredients are.  Other than that, a solid location, now that they've got their feet under them.

This place is great!  I'll admit, most of mani/pedi experiences happen in North Phoenix because I usually would go with my mil.  But my aunt was visiting from out of town and we were both due for a little nail TLC.    I didn't know where to go so I starting scanning yelp and the interwebs looking for help.  I wanted something that didn't require us to travel too far (she was staying near tempe diablo stadium) and we were planning on going shopping at Fashion Square later in the day (post nail mission).  I was trying to avoid the craziness of downtown Scottsdale but also didn't want to go someplace fancy due due to cost efficiency and appointments typically being necessary.  It can be hard to find a regular nail salon!  But alas!  Nancy's to the rescue.  We arrived before it opened, which was perfect because we were the first ones in the door and taken care of.  We weren't focused on getting in and fast, we just wanted to enjoy ourselves.  They did a great job on the nails and have very reasonable prices.  Their mani/pedi combo is also terrific.  So I strongly suggest that if you need a place to get your nails done, Nancy's will do a great job and your feet and hands will feel extra pretty and loved.

Thanks to Yelp Eats my husband and I finally got down to Nobuo.  Word to the wise, if you want to eat here, arrive when they open or make a reservation.  It is popular.  We kept our dinner fairly simple, kimchee, yellowtail w/grapefruit, pork buns and the soy/miso marinated yellowtail.  All were absolutely divine!  I could have eaten so many of the yellowtail grapefruit combos.  They come on little spoons and you're supposed to eat it in one bite.  The acidity from the grapefruit works perfectly with the yellowtail.  It just melts in your mouth.  And the kimchee.  So so good.  Sometimes I'm not a big fan, but this was delish.  The pork buns have been mentioned tons in reviews.  They are every bit as wonderful as described.  Unlike your typical bbq pork bun, the bun is folded around the pork belly which means everything is cooked to perfection and is just the right temperature (since steamed pork buns can burn your mouth because they're so hot in the middle, but oh so good).  We had the apple fritters to finish and they were just divine.  It was the perfect meal and we left feeling perfectly fed and content.  We weren't overstuffed or uncomfortable, just ridiculously happy.  We can't wait for the weather to cool down again, get on our bikes, and ride downtown to heritage square.

Thanks to Yelp, we found The Hill Group and our amazing realtor Joshua.  Just from speaking to him on the phone, I knew Josh was the right person to help us find our first home.  He and my husband connected instantly when discussing areas to look for a house.  He was incredibly patient with my concerns and requests and ultimately helped us find and close on our amazing new house in the Coronado district!  We will certainly be recommending The Hill Group to anyone we know who is looking to buy a home.  Thanks so much, Josh!  We love the house! :)

Still amazing as always. This time Joshua helped us sell the house which he helped us buy! It was a pleasure to go through the process with him again, this time from the seller's side. I would choose no one else to be part of my home buying/selling process and am going to dearly miss having his advice when next we search for a house. He fought for us in every situation and we couldn't have asked for a better realtor.

"Best diner in Phoenix"  That's what my husband said as we left our brunch at Joe's today.  We love our diners when we actually decide to go to them.  We got pretty spoiled when we lived in San Francisco, frequenting the Mel's Drive In on Geary which was within walking distance of our apartment.  We can't walk to Joe's (though we could bicycle) but it certainly hits the spot.  We've been eyeing it for quite some time.  We live in the Coronado and drive past it often.  Always with a full parking lot, we say to each other "we really need to try that place".  We've seen the reviews here on yelp... and yet again we repeat it.  Today we went.  In 30 minutes we'd been seated, fed, paid, the whole shebang.  Joe came by the table and hi.  We both got the Number Two with pancakes.  Yum.  My husband was thrilled with his poached eggs.  I was just happy to have pancakes for the first time in months.  It was busy but not too busy.  We were seated right away (just after 12pm on a Sunday).  Next time I really want to try the biscuits & gravy.  We'll also be taking my parents here when they come into town to visit.  The price is right and the food is good.  Yum.

We love it here.  We recently bought a house in the neighborhood (having just moved to Phoenix 2 months ago) and my husband discovered that a coworker lives in the Coronado!  Thus the discovery that they all get together at the Living Room.  We've gone there now the last two weeks to get a feel for it and start frequenting what we are sure will become a staple in our lives as Coronado residents.  Mary the bartender is awesome.   Happy hour is AMAZING with 2.50 drafts, $5 wines, and sliders and a bottle for $20.  the food is awesome and so are the people.  we will be here often and LOVE supporting our local business. :)

I had a craving for ice cream last night.  Culver's in particular, but it was just too far away and it was late-ish.  So as my husband continued to say no to my requests for frozen custard and I was thinking about getting myself there but also thinking about how long it would take, I came up with a solution.  Fro Yo!  So we did a search.  And we found Yogurtology.  And now we will live happily ever after.  (I especially love that they list the ingredients on the screens above the flavors.  I was careful to avoid caffeine that late at night)

I love this place.  It's cozy and comfortable.  The open kitchen reminds me of home (San Francisco) and so much is made in house.  And it makes me feel like I've been invited over for dinner.  The first time we tried Beckett's was for their first birthday.  I'd been hearing about the restaurant and signed up for the newsletter.  My husband couldn't say no when it was 1 dollar entrees for their birthday!  We had a fabulous meal!  The only complaint I had that night was that my chocolate dessert wasn't quite what I expected and too rich for me.  We went again with friends visiting from the UK.  We needed a place to go for dinner on a Sunday night and our pickings were limited.  A reservation was made for Beckett's (and the Sunday night half price Arizona wines special) and we went.  Everyone loved their food.  My hubby wasn't feeling too great so he didn't eat much, but he enjoyed what he ordered.  Every plate was cleaned as best each person could.  I even got to enjoy the chicken the next day for lunch because one of my friends couldn't finish.  It was divine reheated!  No desserts the second time round, but we did start with the charcuterie board and it was delish!  Especially the housemade cranberry preserves.  We even bought a jar to take home with us!  We're looking forward to going back again.

This is one of our favourite restaurants in Phoenix.  We've been back numerous times, bringing family and friends, and it never fails to disappoint.  That's what keeps us coming back.  The service and food are always top notch.

We absolutely love Dr Jarvis and North Kenilworth!  And most importantly, our sweet puppy loves her too!  They've been so great to us, and as new pet owners (as adults) we are so thankful.  We has a crazy scare the first week with a too rough playtime with a littermate and a slice in our pup's ear.  Dr Jarvis had us come in and looked at it and glued it back together and didn't charge us for the visit!  And then she followed up a few days later to see how he was doing!  We went in for our third set of vaccination for the pup and he didn't even notice anything was going on.  He gave kisses to everyone and has a couple overexcited uncontrollable bladder releases.  We are so happy to have North Kenilworth in our neighborhood and only a short drive away!

This is a location specific review.  I've attempted to come to this location a couple occasions.  I live closer to the Biltmore location and love it.  The atmosphere and food is great.  So, I was happy that there is a location near my in laws (it's always exciting to be able to eat healthy and enjoy their company).  We went for father's day, it wasn't all that impressive and the service was pretty lackluster, but my meal was good.  I went again with my MIL a few weeks ago for a late lunch.  The place was swarming and our electronic notifier never went off.  We waited for about half an hour before I went in and asked if we were ever going to be seated.  And then I got attitude.  And the service was SO SLOW.  It wasn't particularly happy, friendly, or polite.  There is a vibe at this location and I don't like it.  I'll keep my Biltmore location thank you very much.  And will not be going back to this TFK again.  It's a waste of time and money.

So after hearing about this place and then reading about it in the latest Phoenix Magazine, we decided to give it a try with our friends.  We made a 7:15 reservation for 4 for a Saturday night.  By the time we left the place was hopping and crazy busy.  We started with a little salumi and Cowgirl Creamery Inverness (oh how I miss the bay and Cowgirl whenever I wanted!) as well as oysters for the ladies.  The jam with the cheese was delish and the mustard with the meat had a great kick to it.  They are not shy with the spice here!  And the oysters were meaty and divine.  I wanted more.. so many more.  Around the table we shared a bottle of the Chablis Chardonnay, which was crisp and refreshing, just what you need on a summer night in Phoenix.  Mains ordered were, short rib stew, salmon, jambalaya, and the bbq ribs.  All were enjoyed immensely.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, the stew was spicy and filling, the jambalaya had a growing heat to it (which my friend enjoyed, it just slowed him down), and the ribs disappeared so quickly I'm not sure my husband actually ate dinner. :P  The cole slaw that came with the ribs was yummy, as that's the only bit I got to try.  For dessert we ordered the blueberry cheesecake and the hot chocolate cake.  The desserts are served in little mason jars which makes the portion just right to share so you can get that taste of sweet.  The cheesecake with the graham cracker streusel with almonds was yummy.  And the hot chocolate cake's cream on top was very good and the cake was nice and moist.   We had a great time and we'd go back again with visitors or family.  They validate your parking and ours was free since the food came out so fast, we were in and out!

We're big fans of Churn and Federal Pizza.  I also like Postinos, but not as much as the other two.  Windsor has been a bit of a let down.  We did dinner with friends here a few weeks ago, particularly this restaurant for the kids menu and our friends had 3 kids under 10.  Good idea? Yes.  Dinner for 8 was good and affordable.  I purposefully ordered a slightly bland meal due to preparing for a half marathon later that week.  Cocktails are good.  Apps are yummy.  But goodness me, do not come here when it's actually busy.  We had a group of 8 so we were able to get a reservation for dinner.  All of that was fine and we finished with ice cream at Churn.  It was a good night.  Brunch.  NO.  We arrived at 12:15.  We're post church brunchers.  We waited for 45 minutes to finally sit down, order a pitcher of pimms, and there was NO PIMMS in the pimms.  It tasted like lemon juice.  We asked to switch it out for a pitcher of beer (bad idea for this girl who doesn't really tolerate gluten).  Then we ordered.  Loaded chips, frittata for me, matador for husband, donuts to share.  No donuts.  How do you run out of donuts?  Seriously?  He comes back, no matador.  So, we have bad pimms, no donuts, and no matador.  All the food my husband was looking forward to, was a disappointment or unavailable.    My frittata was decent, husband's basic breakfast unappealing (I make a better basic than that) and the fruit cup saddening.  It's summer -- where were the berries!  Neither one of us was in the mood for beer so that didn't life our spirits.    Our lesson: don't go to brunch here.  The most depressing thing was that we tried it because we enjoyed our last experience.  And this experience we did not enjoy.  We know of other places where it may not be as gourmet, but we're in and out quickly and always leave happy.  What makes me really sad is that we probably won't return or recommend this restaurant.  I can't really go back now that I had that experience.  There are other places that haven't let me down, time after time.

So, after over a year of begrudging the inability to find a parking spot here and avoiding a trip, the heat of a summer afternoon in Phoenix drove me to Church (and a parking spot) for ice cream.  I can officially say this is my favorite ice cream spot in Phoenix.  We love Sweet Republic but it's far away for us central phx inhabitants.  and while they have so many options, we only really like the mint chip.  Here they have not an overwhelming number of flavors, but oh so delicious.  Husband loved his strawberry shortcake sundae (all very creative on that board; we'll be back for more).  I loved my vietnamese coffee and madagascar vanillla, with the vanilla addition a suggestion by my love scooper.  So yummy!  I had one scoop of each with snickerdoodle cookie, which was just the right amount of soft and crunchy.  We fell in love!  I can't wait to go back (next on my list is strawberry ice cream in a waffle cone) and husband wants one of the cookie ice cream sandwiches.  So happy that we finally went for a visit and now we know we have fantastic homemade ice cream just 5 minutes away. :)

I needed a floral piece to be sent to my sister in law who lives in Pittsburgh (I live in Phoenix, AZ) post surgery.  I didn't want to use an internet provider as I am extremely bored with the same arrangements over and over again.  I wanted to send her something sweet and unique and utilize a local business.  Clarkie was incredible helpful over the 2-3 weeks we chatted and didn't collect payment from me until the day of delivery!  It was the most pleasant floral order experience I have ever had.  This is the way to go in Pittsburgh, if only for the quality of the service, but the flowers were so pretty too!  Perfect :)

They are just downright fluffy.  You've consumed far too many and it doesn't even feel like it.  They don't sit in your stomach like lead.  It's the most glorious donut experience ever.

OMG.  I've been wanting to try Paletas Betty for the past year.  My husband works just down the street and I've only recently been reminded that it's right there.  A few of his employees went over the other day and he was telling me what they got.    And I remembered that I wanted to try them.  With the current horrid heat, a paleta is the perfect remedy.  We walked in and had the key lime pie and strawberry.  Both were so good we decided to split one more for a dessert of our paleta meal.  The bananas foster is very much like a little dessert.  It's not as fruity as the others, with the refreshment factor of fresh fruit.  We loved them so much we're going to make it a weekly treat.  Perfect for the hot Arizona summer. Yum!  PS  They even have treats for the doggies!  We're thinking about bring our crazy aussie with us next time for a peanut butter treat :)

Ok,  Yes, their first endeavor at a food truck festival kind of fell on it's face.  But does that mean that when they get all the feedback and actually try to fix what was wrong with this year's festival you shouldn't go next year?  NO!  We wanted to go when the sun was not shining because my husband is a redhead and we wanted it to be cooler.  But we got stuck during the rush.  And while we did get some good food while we were there, it wasn't worth the ticket price (but if the beer we drank was free, then it could have worked).  Some trucks were prepared, others weren't.  I'm not really surprised the the trucks that have been around longest were the ones that lasted at the festival (short leash comes to mind).  I was kind of disappointed that some of the trucks were handing out samples that aren't even variations of what they regularly serve.  That bugged me.   The fry bread truck right near the entrance was fantastic and had a long line to prove it.  They totally could have used an extra hand and maybe not have given people so many options.  Just hand them the food and make them move on.  That being said, the pork and green chile was soo good.  I look forward to seeing improvements on the next one.  I just hope they don't decide to charge more than they did this year.  It needs to be amazing to charge lots of money (I hear the festival in LA is like $75 to get in).    I just wish that every time we walked up to a truck it wasn't dark or had just run out.  That was so lame.

This is classic Italian food and dining.  I felt like I was back in Italy!  It's not going to be what you really expect when you see "Italian Restaurant".  I was a little skeptical being someone who doesn't eat much pasta, but I survived and had an incredible meal.  I know the menu changes pretty regularly, which is fine with me.  There's a few antipasti dishes, pasta, and proteins.  I wasn't amazed by the pasta (Italy still holds that crown) but was happy with the anitpasti and proteins that we ordered.  Additionally, the desserts were fantastic!  Bianco's mother was in town and had made a special galette that night.  It was magnificent. The wine list is also pretty good.  Keep in mind that it's a small place so it doesn't do a bunch and the restaurant is quite intimate.  That being said, it is the truest representation of classic Italian food and dining that I've experienced in the Valley so that's why it has 5 stars from me.

Formerly known as "Italian Restaurant" this is the only Italian restaurant I will go to in the valley.  I'm sure there is some very nice Italian at other restaurants, but this is mine.  Always an authentic dining experience, never overwhelmed with pasta and always served delicious homemade favourites.  This is my favourite local Italian family to support.  Speaking of, I think it's time for another visit. :)

I'd been meaning to try out this cute little shop for a long time. Well, that time finally came one rare cold morning after dropping my husband off at the lightrail station and before I headed off to school for my 6 week substitute teaching gig.  Damn, that cardamom latte is pretty delicious. Amazingly awesome i would say. I love that they have various milks for those of us who aren't always dairy friendly or tolerant. I enjoyed my visit so much that the husband and I both dropped by the next time we were in need of coffee in the morning. Great little spot!

HEADS UP!  This place is now a BBQ joint and it is amazing.  First day with the new menu today, hubby and I went for lunch.  Ginger ale for him, sparkling lemonade for me.  Both refreshing in this heat.  We both did combo plates; smartest decision ever.  He got the beer hot sausage and brisket with potato salad and corn bread.  I got the turkey and ribs with potato salad and cole slaw.  All were delicious.  I'm still thinking about that food and when I'm going back.  It's right around the corner from my house...  Each meat has a different sauce (based on animal type: pig, bird, cow etc).  We can't wait to share it with our fellow bbq lovers.  I haven't been a fan of honey bears for a while now, and we've been going to Rudy's in Chandler to get a bbq fix, BUT NOW we've got the best stuff right around the corner.  You must try it.  Now.  It's so good.

This was my most disappointing airport food experience ever.  Thinking, "hey, we went to barrio cafe and it was a great meal, we can have a good meal at the airport.  great!" I went in with expectations.  And those expectations were so not met.  First off, no frozen margaritas.  They're on the menu, but they were out?  How does one run out of traditional frozen margarita?  Pretty sure you take all the usual ingredients with ice and stick it in a blender.  So 2 members of our party left.  Then we get food.  Disaster.  I order the cochinita pibil (which I had the last time I was at Barrio Cafe).  Definitely not as good.  Didn't finish it.  Hardly ate it. Husband was served overcooked, dry, microwaved chicken.  We had margaritas on the rocks.  They tasted like salt.  Just salt.  They comped the chicken (after my husband complained), but we're not going back.  There are better restaurants for us to spend our money at.

This is our go to restaurant at the airport.  Every single restaurant past the security checkpoints is always packed.  The only place that can handle all the chaos is LGO.  But instead of hiking to those gates, we just sit down to a nice dinner at Chelsea's Kitchen.  It is wonderful to have the many Phoenix based restaurants in Terminal 4.  It makes me feel like even if you just come through the airport you can see something that truly represents Phoenix while you're there.  Even when there is a wait at this restaurant the service is always fantastic.  If they mess up your order they do everything they can to make it right (it gets busy, and I become extra understanding, esp if they try to rectify).  We've done breakfast, lunch and dinner, all yummy and a great start to our trips.  I'm generally not a fan of airport food, but I always look forward to dining at Chelsea's Kitchen if we're headed to the airport. :)

We've never eaten inside the restaurant, but we have regularly been driving home from work and said to one another "I could really do pizza tonight"  30 seconds later he's got his phone out and we're ordering our regular: big star pizza and tlc salad.  That's really all we get and everytime it's amazing.  With the restaurant being an old bank building, I love that they've maintained the drive thru lane and we can just drive up to pay and receive our order.  It's ridiculously convenient.  We've eaten a lot of pizzas in the valley, this is by far our favorite and now we can't eat any others without a) feeling ill or b) comparing it.  Nothing is as good.   Try it, you shouldn't be disappointed.

This is a fantastic local, downtown watering hole and exactly what we needed.  It's a rustic space that still retains much of the market grocery charm but with phenomenal touches from Aaron, Lee, and team.  The patio is not too crowded and seated nicely, perfect for dinner or drinks with friends.  The flow is also fantastic as you can either head directly to the bar or browse the market on your way to the counter to order.    We had a limited menu tonight for opening night.  That being said, we both enjoyed our meals thoroughly.  The AZ burger (& fries) was delicious and the chino salad was good and refreshing (though I'm not a noodles in my salad person, but I wanted a salad).  Both with a farmer's cup in hand (pimms drink - yum!) and I was giddy as a schoolchild over the self serve water station with sparkling and still options.  I want to go back right now for the sparkling water on tap alone!  We each also had a smores cookie for dessert.  It captures the graham crackeriness of a smores and chocolate chunks and chewy texture without marshmallows.  It was an interesting (and delicious) interpretation.  I was also eyeing the snickerdoodles.  I'll be back for those.  We were sent away with a couple corn cookies to try (at Aaron's insistence).  THe husband is currently a fan (description: sugar cookie, but like cornbread, but not; it's really good), I'm skeptical of most things with corn.  We'll certainly be back and are excited to see the rest of the menu and make this our local hangout. :)

Hands down, best pizza in Phoenix.  We've tried several of the eateries around town, becoming regulars at Federal and Parlor. But it's not even in the same league.  It's been a long time since I had a high quality piece of Italian pie. Throw in the fact that cannolis are on the dessert menu and my craving for pizza Saturday night was sky high. Not far from our house, we figured we better try it now before we move.  We arrive on a decent weather night around 6:30. The place is packed. 45 minute wait for a table, or sit now at the bar. We opt for the bar as it's just the two of us and we are hungry.  Start with caprese (so delicious and the mozz is amazing). Yum. Two pizzas. Husband demolishes his. I finish half because, ahem, I want cannoli. Both amazing. Well, mine was great (Margherita), I never got a chance to try husbands.  OMG, the cannoli. I haven't had cannoli since Sicily in 2009. I was SO FREAKING HAPPY. I want them now. I want them all the time. Knowing that I can get cannoli like that here in Phoenix is dangerous knowledge.  We've got about 3 weeks before we leave Phoenix. We'll be back.

This is a great and gorgeous new Whole Foods.  We've been waiting for this location to open for a while now, and it's finally here.  Now that we're a few months into it's existence things it's becoming a huge staple in my life.  The buffet in the prepared foods area is HUGE.  I used to shop at the Tempe store (and I hate the PV store) and the size and amount of food in the prepared foods area is astounding.  Having the juice bar in the middle of prepared food and produce is kind of ingenious.  No one has to leave the store to get their juice and it's right by the product.  I feel like the produce area is smaller than some of the other WFM stores, but that could just be a layout issue.  I love the new freezers and fridge cases.  The cheese/deli is kind of small but packs a bunch with great product.  Ridiculous amounts of awesome ciders, gluten free beer, craft beer, and wine.  20 highland tavern is a nice touch.  I love it.  And I love being able to get all my shopping done at T&C.  With trader joes and WF right next to each other, my life is made much easier.

I'm addicted.  That's the summary.  A) Grass fed burgers.  Automatic happy. B) Shattered potato chips with awesome dip/sauce stuff.  I could eat those all day. C) Indoor/Outdoor seating D) Prompt service F) Never too busy  We have not had a bad burger.  They are all delicious (so says my husband; I always order the cheeseburger).  The lemonade comes in a cup with finger imprints (for the clumsy, this is a plus.  It doesn't slip out of my hands!)  The menu is short and sweet and may not appease or appeal to all, but this girl who will jump at the sight of a grass fed burger cooked perfectly with delicious chips on the side is happy.  And there have been weeks where I've found any excuse to get myself there for dinner multiple nights in one week.

This is a great little restaurant.  We are recently huge fans of the Parlor, so thought that finally eating some Chinese food (that's not dim sum) since we moved to Phoenix was called for.  Plus, Central Phoenix is our home.  We tried a variety of things.  Spring roll with beef neck, steamed buns with duck/lamb pastrami, dumplings with pork & kimchi, the mission chinese kung pao and fried rice with bbq pork.  The spring roll was good, glad I tried it, probably wouldn't eat it again (the sauce was weird).  Steamed buns were amazing and delicious and I want more of them.  Dumplings were ok, interesting, spicy, probably wouldn't order again.  Husband loved his kung pao (I want to order it next time) and my fried rice was smokey and full of flavor and veggies and pork (as opposed to the mostly rice version of most chinese take out).  Cocktails.  I would come here just for the drinks.  Oh my goodness they were amazing.  Sloe burn is at the top of the list, first recommendation to anyone.  One of the best cocktails I've ever tried.  Temperance tamer was just what I needed tonight, which was a little sweet and a little sour (grapefruit, yum).  This is a place we will certainly come back to.  We could also see ourselves just coming in for drinks and steamed buns.  That would be delicious.

Word on the street is that Ollie Vaughn's is a keeper.  Word on the street is RIGHT!  I've never been to Lux myself, but have heard all the praise and was intrigued when I heard their former baker opened a lunch shop in the Coronado 'hood.  Always skeptical of salads and sandwich fare, I decided to give it try.  The hubby decided to work from home on my birthday so that we could spend the day together, even if he spent his time on calls or the computer (which is just better because we share a car and I didn't have to drive him to and from work!).  So, I asked to go to Ollie Vaughn's for birthday lunch.  Away we went.  Grilled cheese for him (on brioche), ham sandwich for me (marbled rye) and split a large spinach salad.  Lavender green teas for both.  Ham sandwich was ridiculously good.  I think I still regret handing over my other half to my husband.  I got his grilled cheese in exchange.  It was very good and grilled to perfection (crunchy on the outside, oh yes), but I couldn't get past the mushrooms.  He loved it, but it wasn't quite the grilled cheese for me.  Which is fine, I loved the ham and want to try ALL the other sandwiches.  Now I sit at home sipping tea and enjoying some of a chocolate chip cookie and pumpkin spice tea bread.  The tea bread is so yummy (moist, flavorful, out of this world good).  The cookie is ok, but I'm a choc chip cookie snob.  It's way better than your average choc chip cookie.  I wanted to eat all the baked goods in the case.  The strawberry cheesecake, apple pie, raspberry chocolate scone, almond croissant, etc.  I will certainly be back.    AND the service is wonderful!  They have cookbooks out too to browse which I loved.  An avid cook and baker, those are my preferred reading material.

Great Mexican food in Central Phoenix.  I haven't been here when it's too busy, which always seems to be the case at other Upward Projects restaurants.  So I'm happy to have Joyride be my new go to.  I can find parking, get good drinks, good service, delicious tacos etc, and the best churros I've ever had.  (the cheese y mas is a must try but dangerous for the dairy intolerant)  They have a lot of open doors windows, so depending on the weather it can get a bit chilly and they keep it kinda dark.  But otherwise, we've been very happy with our dining experiences here.
