One of my favorite restaurants in the Valley! The service here is always excellent, no matter who our waiter is. The food is very high quality. I often find myself here for an impromptu girl's night out, and the ambiance is just fantastic. Plus, they're open late, which is great for those late night cravings! I crave their French fries probably three times a week, they are THAT good. And the aioli sauce that they serve with the fries tastes so amazing, I have never been able to find another aioli even remotely close to being as good as that. Great ... now I'm craving them again! :)

Kevin & his team did such a spectacular job on my parents' home. After 15 years, many of the tiles on their home were coming loose, and the protective paper underneath was worn severely thin. Over the course of several days, the team worked their tails off removing all the tile, expertly replacing the protective paper underneath, and re-tiling the roof. Although my parents opted to keep their original tile, Choice Roofing made the roof look so brand new, and now all the neighbors are jealous! The house, built in 1998, is now up to 2013 roofing codes. Plus, their workmanship is guaranteed for 10 years, and the product is guaranteed for 50 years. The job was completed well within the quoted time, and my parents couldn't be happier ... and they're not that easy to please! :) Thanks, Kevin & crew for a job well done!

I started getting my nails done in junior high, and I've been to countless places trying to find the best place to get the job done. Trina Nail and Spa on Ellsworth is DEFINITELY that place. I have been going there consistently for about five years now, and you can't beat them for the service and the price. My best friend and I love to spend a weekend afternoon there, getting dolled up for the week ahead. Trina is the best at waxing services, I consistently return to her for my eyebrow waxes - she is the only one who shapes them perfectly! Acrylic nails are strong, yet not thick and bulky like many other local places do them. They also don't cheat you on the pedicures - the chairs are extremely comfortable, and the massages (including a hot towel wrap and hot stone massage) are extensive and extremely relaxing. When I'm traveling, I hold off on my nail services until I get home so that Trina and her team can take care of me.  A couple of things to keep in mind - they are closed on Sundays, and cannot accept tips on credit cards. You may pay with your credit card, but all tips must be in cash.

I eat at this location probably once a week and have for quite some time. The staff at this location are excellent. They are always so mindful of your time, especially around lunchtime when I don't have all day to sit and wait. The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious and the restaurant is very clean. I have used them several times for catering purposes and while I am bummed they don't deliver, it is always great to know that my large orders will be ready on time when I show up to pick them up. This is my favorite location by far!

I am so pleased with the work that Pedro and his team did on my backyard a few months ago! I had a very specific idea in mind for landscaping the backyard of my first home, and Pedro came out to meet with me on site for a consultation. He was very attentive, listened to all of my ideas, and was able to quickly and concisely put together some ideas and a price quote for me. Not only that, he had a lot of great ideas to make my backyard look even better. He provided me with a ton of options for my pavers and the artificial turf I wanted. Most importantly, everything he spoke to me about was within my price range - there was no pushy up-sell, which I really appreciated. Pedro was available anytime I had questions along the way, the work was completed within the time frame that he had quoted me, and his team were most definitely very hard workers. I would very highly recommend Pedro and FNV Landscaping, and plan on utilizing his services again for my next home.

I was a little bit apprehensive about trying the Pudgy Pup at first because I was a new dog-mom and was afraid my puppy (who was 6 months at the time) wouldn't take well to the new environment. Once summer rolled around, I had to try it - he was used to going to the dog park 3-4 times a week, and he needed that playtime, but in an air-conditioned environment! One of my mom's coworkers recommended Pudgy Pup and I am SO thankful I gave it a try.  The entire staff know my pup Jethro and he is always greeted by name, and so warmly. The site keeps your paperwork on file, and all dogs are required to have all their vaccinations done and participate in a screening process to ensure they are capable of assimilating into a pack.  Another thing I love is that they do not kennel the dogs. Everything is out in the open. I can't tell you how many times I've walked in to pick up Jethro and all the dogs are just lounging around, hanging out, enjoying each other's company. They are well monitored, and you can tell the dogs love the people who work there.  On top of that, Pudgy Pup offers grooming services. I decided to have Jethro groomed for the first time there. They did a full bath and brush, plus clipped his nails, and even more. Again, they don't kennel them at all, which is great - I was going to take him to PetSmart originally, but I am not keen on the fact that PetSmart kennel-dries their dogs. Jethro was able to hang out with the groomers while he dried, and they trimmed his nails perfectly.  The best part is, they open early ... 6am weekdays, 7:30am weekends. This is so great for me, because Jethro and I are both early risers. It has been so wonderful to be able to have my quiet Saturday mornings, knowing Jethro is having the time of his life with his buddies. And it's only $5 for the first three hours!  I can't recommend Pudgy Pup enough. Check it out, you won't regret it, and your pup will love you even more for it! Even once the weather cools off again, we'll still be visiting weekly!

This is one of the best mid-sized music venues I have been to in years. The bartenders were friendly and attentive, and they seem to run a tight ship there. I plan on going back to try the food at some point. The interior is very nicely decorated, the stage is more spacious than most stages at similar venues, and they actually believe in leaving the air conditioning on when a band is playing! Trust me, it was much appreciated. I plan on being back, and soon!

Even weeks after my visit, I am still so frustrated. I visited this location after being sick for nearly 5 weeks. I was losing my voice constantly and couldn't stop coughing, so hard that I had pulled muscles in my back. Upon first glance, everything looked great. The office is spotless, and the receptionists are very kind. The wait was not long at all, and the woman who took all my vitals was wonderful. You could tell she enjoyed her job and liked being there. Then, they put me in an exam room, and I waited.  The young man who came in to check out my concerns was a PA. He asked me some questions about how I was feeling and I had to explain probably six or seven times while he checked me out. He kept asking me the same questions over and over again. It started making me feel like he was doubting me. I told him I had taken some OTC meds a couple weeks before and they didn't help after a week, so I stopped. He said asked if I would like to do a strep test. I said if he thought it would rule anything out, then yes please. He asked me a couple more times and I said please, let's do it, you seem to think it's important. He then told me, "well, I know you don't have strep, but let's do it anyway."   After waiting for 20 more minutes they did the test and yes, it was negative. He started asking me the same questions all over again. I had no voice, was having issues talking, and had to cough after every couple of words. He tells me, "well, I don't see anything wrong with you." Um, excuse me?  He ended up prescribing me three medications "just in case" - some antibiotics (because there was "no way" I was sick but "let's cover our bases"), another pill to help with the coughing (it didn't) and another OTC medication to help with the congestion I did not have. $200 later, I am still sick, going on 8 weeks now.  I understand that some people do not present with illness the same way as others, and I also understand that this gentleman was doing his job. But the way he was speaking to me was so unacceptable. He made me feel as though I was lying about being ill, and that I was there trying to get prescriptions for no reason. I would have much rather not spent $65 on medications that didn't work but after feeling terrible for so long I was willing to try anything. I was actually quite offended by the way I was treated. It takes a lot for me to go to the doctor as it is, I hate going, so when I do go, I want to feel taken care of, not accused.   Needless to say, I will never be returning to this location.

Trust me, you've never had a hot yoga experience quite like what you'll get at HYU! The classes are 60 minutes long and the class times fit perfectly into anyone's busy lifestyle. The facilities are state of the art - beautiful, serene, and of course very clean - and the instructors always have your best interest at heart. This studio has two different types of classes (H27 is great for those who are new to hot yoga!), so you can always switch things up. Every class is a new experience! Do yourself a favor and try HYU out, I know you'll love it as much as I do!

I can't say enough positive things about this location. The staff is pleasant and helpful, even when I come strolling in at 430am. I love that this gym is fully staffed 24 hours a day, and all of the equipment is immaculately maintained. Most of the machines are also equipped to where you can just plug your headphones straight into the machine to listen to TV - super awesome! The locker room is so clean and spacious. At my last gym, I dreaded having to get ready for work in the locker room after my workout, but here, I have no problems. They have free wi-fi, as well. Check them out!
