I have been a client for over 10 years. 6 dogs later I am still going back even though there are othe vets a lot closer but I travel all the way over to 43rd ave. Because my furry babies deserve the best. I am still waiting to have a room dedicated to us. Everybody who there are there because they love animals.

They have changed the way they make their oatmeal, stopped using REAL maple syrup, pancakes were horrible.  Coffee watered down.

Awesome...all 3 of my huskies looked and smelled amazing. Will totally be back with them. The staff was very friendly and great with my furry babies.
