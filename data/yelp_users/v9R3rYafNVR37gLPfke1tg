Love their cheeseburger, can tell it's real meat no 90% fillers! Hotcakes, real maple syrup and best bacon ever! Do expect about 1 to 1hr1/2 wait but totally worth it!

One of BEST CAFE places in West Valley! From friendly baristas, owner can often be seen roasting the coffee in site or checking with guest. Iced Cafe Cubano-love it! And if coffee it's not you thing, the food its in conservative portions but delish! Live music on Fridays & Saturdays evenings.   Also offers wine tasting & seems to have a selection of wines & beers- but not into any of those so can't comment.

This asian market has a small section of fruit and veggieand fresh sea food, it's reasonable priced. I often go for the instant thai tea or viet coffee mixes.Even thou it's a good size market it does not compare to the asian markets in Garden Grove,CA. One good thing, since it's an asian market you can find fresh/live seafood and cheap asian must haves. In addition, there's food items from middle east, India and in the frozen section you can find goya products often used in Latin America.

So we saw this restaurant being reviewed on Check Please AZ program and my hubby and I decided to check it out.. Totally enjoyed the ambience, casual, hip and friendly not up tight as some trendy new places can be..We started with the Chicharr√≥n de Queso, YUM! Fried cheese, need to say more?! We also had the side of guacamole and chips also very fresh and tasty. My hubby had the Naco Torta, which had aguacate avocado), carne asada, some veggies all topped off with a sunny side up eggs on a telera type bread (Mexican torta type bread)! He loved it! It was quite a large serving and he had to take half of it home. I had 2 Carne asada tacos and 2 cochinita (marinated pork) tacos! LOVED the Carne asada-drooling! The cochinita were very tasty too but I'm an Asada meat lover! Didn't get dessert because we where stuffed..I was a bit dissapointed with my Mojito, it tasted more like an unsweetened lemonade! But that can be easily forgiven with such yummy food! Definitely will be making this a favorite!

Pretty good coffee! Friendly barista. Ambience is totally lay back. If you expect fancy, got the wrong place here, the decor is between industrial and forgotten in time classroom furniture. But if it's a good cup of cafe you seek, then you're in good company, give their matador (mocha n cinnamon) a try, it has a good balance between the two flavors n coffee!
