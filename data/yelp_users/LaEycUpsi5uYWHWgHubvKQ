We were here last Saturday and had a really good time. The steaks were delicious and the service was good. Hubby had the swordfish and was over the moon about it (it was his first time having it) My only complaint was that the music was REALLY loud for a restaurant but hey, we were entertained.  We had a great evening and look forward to returning next time we are craving steak!

My Hubs and I really wanted to try this place out. We LOVE supporting local business and this place is very close to our house.  We tried it a few months ago and sorry to say it, but it was not memorable at all. The food was pretty mediocre. I'm a blonde hair, blue-eyed Italian and I have made more flavorful Mexican dishes at home.  I suppose it's not for those who crave deep authentic flavor, but perhaps it's acceptable for those who prefer a far less authentic flavor than you would expect from a privately owned Mexican Restaurant.  The place has potential if they updated the interior a bit and changed the menu completely, but it doesn't even feel like a Mexican eatery. It was kind of off-putting. The music was odd, as well.  We won't be back, unfortunately.

Brandy. Is. Amazing.  I've never had trust in a stylist. She nails my color request every time and I leave that place looking amazing.

This review is for Brandy Wilder at the Arrowhead location I have been getting my hair done by Brandy for just short of a decade and I hope this girl never stops doing hair.  Her color expertise is on point and I wouldn't trust anyone to do the kind of quality work she does.  I always leave the salon feeling beautiful and get compliments on my hair daily.  I would hire her to be a personal stylist if I had the money.  THANK YOU BRANDY FOR BEING SO AMAZING AT WHAT YOU DO!  I can't wait until my next visit!

I went to Rolf's and had an appointment with a stylist named Brandy. It was my first time cutting my hair in over a year, as I was attempting to grow it out for the first time in my life. It goes without saying that I walked in with VERY damaged hair that had suffered through a lot of coloring. I had decided to go back to a medium length and brought her this photo: http://nzh.s3.amazonaws.com/images/1-hairstyles/gwyneth-paltrow/gwyneth-paltrow-bob-hairstyles.jpg I asked her to take me from a light brown to a light ash blonde, which is a pretty hefty request. Not only did the color turn out absolutely gorgeous, but the cut is damn near identical to the photo I brought in. I uploaded before and afters to my profile to show the difference.  My hair feels light and bouncy again and I couldn't have asked for a better stylist. It's also a style I can do at home thanks to the tips she gave me. I love finding someone I can trust because while hair always grows back, no one wants a crappy haircut. Thanks!

After learning that my stylist was no longer working at this salon I was sad, but hearing from the management and stylists why she'd left (their tall tale sounding version anyway) I was pretty much appalled.  The only reason I gave Rolf's business was because Brandy was there and to think after nearly ten years of her doing amazing work, increasing their profits, she gets spoken about the way she was by management?....to CUSTOMERS??  Yikes...  I'll give my business to more tactful people.

The first visit was awesome. The service was alright, but the food made up for it. I ordered their shredded beef soft tacos and couldn't get enough. I craved them for a few weeks until we finally went back.  Our second visit was nothing like the first. The waitress recommended crunchy tacos, as it was a new option, so I took her up on it. We waited over an hour and a half (not an exaggeration) outside, while being ignored by our server. The restaurant was slightly busier than the last visit, but there seemed to be adequate staffing. A very large party arrived 30 minutes or so after we were seated and long forgotten. They were seated outside next to our table and tended while we were ignored longer.  The food finally arrived and tasted awful. It was a tasteless, flavorless fried mess. The freshness of the soft corn tortillas was burnt away with the new method.  We weren't offered an apology for the long wait and left without tipping our server. I personally didn't want to pay for the meal at all. After waiting over and hour and a half to be served a simple meal and then having it taste the way it did, we haven't been back.  I'd like to think it was a fluke because I'd really enjoy those soft tacos again, but I've found that Filiberto's Soft Shredded beef tacos are very comparable and just as inexpensive.

This store is a joke.  It is filthy, nothing is put away correctly, they are consistently out of basic necessities and the customer service is simply embarrassing.  I will never go back.  It is 1/4 mile from my home but I will drive 4 miles to the Fry's on Combs because they aren't completely terrible.

I have seen this pediatric office up until my 2 month visit for my son. I WILL NOT RETURN I saw Sandra Romero and have never experienced a more rude doctor in my life.  She was not friendly whatsoever and rolled her eyes at my questions and concerns.  I have chosen to switch to another pediatric office after my experience with her because it was truly that terrible. I don't consider myself that stuffy and choosing to switch doctors is a pain for me, but it's worth it to never have to deal with this woman again.

I almost lose a shoe every time I stop here, the floors are so sticky.  The customer service is typically good, but man... Indoors and out, they need to fork over for some power washers.

Very good experience that was comfortable, validating and relaxed.  She is not your cliche psychic, just a wonderfully gifted woman who made a believer out of this skeptic.

We've lived out here for 3 years and have tried just about every pizza place.  Geno's, Rosatis, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut and Barros are all hit or miss.  We found out about this place and gave it a shot.  LOVE IT! It's cheap, delicious and delivered fast and hot.  Not many places out here can make those claims.  It's become our go-to for pizza nights and we are always left talking about how much we love it.  Thin crust is where it's at, with either garlic herb or butter Asiago crust flavoring.  The cheese bread is to Die for.  Like for real.  I decided it was time to write a review since we are always so happy and was shocked to see it didn't get the best reviews.  Honestly has never disappointed us and we are picky a-holes. Lol

I've been coming here for two years and the quality has been on a constant decline.  Every time I leave, I convince myself it was just a fluke, but I will not be returning after today's visit.  Not only did I drop $90 for mani/pedi (as usual), but it was likely one of the worst I've ever received and I am not a prima-donna by any means.  They did absolutely zero cuticle trim on my hands or feet and to top it all off, the woman applying gel to my toes Cuts my nails AFTER the gel was applied. This is a $20 additional charge for gel on toes and I sat in disbelief as she further ruined, the horrible job that was done in the first place.  $90 down the drain.  Too many bad experiences to give them one more chance to get it right.  This place used to be good, but not anymore. Not even close.

The food can be hit or miss, but when it's on point, it's definitely worth the money.  We enjoy the Chicago deep dish and thin crust.  A tad pricey, but better than the standard.

I wish I had listened to the negative reviews for once. I'm taking a break from violently vomiting to write this review in hopes it saves someone else and their family from experiencing the horror we have. We ordered last night and I went in to pick it up. The restaurant smelled awful, looked dirty and the cashier was rude when I didn't tip her for food I came in to pick up. We ordered Kung Pao Chicken and Orange Chicken. Neither was very good. The orange chicken was dry, had no sauce and was soggy and gross. The Kung Pao had a weird taste to it. Immediately after taking my last bite, I felt nauseous. I am 6 months pregnant and although I have not experienced nausea with this pregnancy, I figured it must be me.  NOPE! I was running for the bathroom within ten minutes and that was AFTER taking a melt away nausea suppressant.  Within an hour, my husband was feeling ill. H didn't start violently vomiting until 1am and that was an every 30minute to one hour ordeal until 10am. He can't even hold down water at this point. THANK GOD we did not feed any of this  disgusting garbage to our baby. I can't even imagine what this would have done to his 11 month old system. I intend on taking what is left of this nasty food back to this disgusting establishment and demanding a refund for what this has put my family through and for what it could have done to my baby. I am pregnant which makes it even more dangerous. DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE. ANY positive reviews must be extremely old because there is no way they're talking about the same food we had. No way in hell. Food poisoning from what appears to be a very dirty place. NEVER AGAIN! I would also like to mention that we have reported this experience to the county health department. THAT is how bad this was.

UPDATE: I am incredibly taken back that the owner had the nerve to come on here in a sad attempt to discredit my honest review. I also find it funny that there is a review from the same week complaining of getting sick off the food and she's badgering that reviewer as well. Tacky business practice. Very tacky.

We love filibertos and were so happy there was one out our way when we moved. This location is great and has delicious food. The tastes always seem to vary between their restaurants, and this one is in the top ranking few for us.  I never knew a simple bean burrito could taste so good. :)

We really like this place. Not everything is a major win but dammit those Pollo Fundido's and Chimichangas are where it's at.

I love this place and the positive atmosphere. The trainers are knowledgeable and were able to really help me (a person who is lost otherwise in a gym).

If you're interested in wasting a lovely Saturday afternoon with a LARGE group of skeeze-bags, then this is definitely the place for you.  Not only will you be gawked at by the mouth-breathing salesmen, but you'll have the treat of being run in circles, hassled and treated like a complete f*cking moron.  I just spent 4 hours in the god forsaken pit of doom with my family and will NEVER return.  You couldn't pay me to shop there.   What a f***ing nightmare.  thats my review. Never. Again. Period.

Trumps any filibertos out in San Tan.  Shredded beef chimi was a little salty but the carne tacos are where it's at.  It's like being in Mexico except you can trust what you're eating.  We will be back!

Got a gift card for this place and gave it a go.  We ordered to-go and my first impression of the place was pretty poor.  I had a question about a menu item and let the employee know we had never eaten there, and he was incredibly rude with me.  Not the best way to handle a first-time patron.  While trying to relay what info he so rudely gave me to my husband, he persistently and aggressively interrupted me with "HELLO... HELLO..." When he could clearly hear me speaking to my husband.  This was a 25 min drive, one way, for pick up and the food was alright.  Definitely not bad, but we feel Rosati's around the corner serves a better Chicago deep dish.  The chopped salad was the highlight of the meal. I definitely loved that.  We also ordered the penne dish for the kids and it was relatively standard.  Would have received 4 stars had we been offered the slightest bit of decency over the phone.  For $50, (for a 14" pizza, salad, some pasta and incredibly poor customer service) I won't be back.  I'll stick with Rosati's.

My husband and I see Dr. Emke and have always been very pleased with the attention and treatment we have received.  I enjoy having the ability to get blood work drawn in the same building.
