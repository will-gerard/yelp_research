Pleasant experience! I was looking for gel wood stain and not only did I find what I was looking for, but the friendly staff gave me a full rundown.The project I did turned out great thanks to the advice I received in selecting the right product and by applying their recommended technique. When I have another woodworking project, I'll be back for sure!

I LOVE this place! I'm a "regular" for lunch and the staff knows my order by heart, right down to my drink preferences. Great food, great atmosphere, great service --- you won't be disappointed.

Disgusting! I feel like this place belongs on a dirty dining report somewhere.  - No covers over the plates on the conveyor belt. - Thick build-up of dust on the ventilation system right over where food is being prepared - Busser cart full of dirty dishes being pushed around in the main dining areas - Long, long lines with tables/seat going unbussed for prolonged periods of time - Rude and disorganized staff  Do yourself the favor, keep driving and go down to Sushi Eye or Sakana.

I'll admit, this place took me almost a year of driving by it before I finally stopped inside. It's one of those questionable hole-in-the-wall places that always seems to have the local fire and police crews eating there. (Must be good, right?) I've been back multiple times now and while the service isn't anything to excited about, the food is an incredible value for the price. We take all of our out-of-town guests there now as a "joke" that has everyone begging to come back for more.  Best Thing on the Menu: Pancakes! Hands down!

This place is a hidden gem! If you weren't specifically looking it you might miss it. Trust me, stop on in, you won't be sorry!  First impression is a friendly staff greeting you at the door of a clean, nicely decorated little restaurant. Followed by an excellent menu variety, fair prices, delicious food and topped off with incredible customer service. My drink never reached half empty and the attention to delight was consistent throughout my visit. Chloe was our server and she's simply a sweetheart!  I will definitely be making the detour off the main roads to go here over other Italian choices in the area. I recommend that others do the same.

I've been coming here for over four years now - no price increases, consistent service and friendly staff. As a girl on the go, the foot massages they give during a pedicure are exactly what I need to slow down and relax.
