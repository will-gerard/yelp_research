First, let me start by saying the five star rating is relative. This is the best place I have found in the valley to get my Vietnamese food fix. I'm not talking the usual pho or spring rolls, I'm talking some real, hard to find, authentic Vietnamese dishes that pho restaurants don't make/serve. Compared to some of the best places I've been for Vietnamese food (including Vietnam), it wouldn't be 5 stars, but for the valley? Definitely.   They have a fairly wide selection of dishes and everything that I have tried has been well made and tastes great. My boyfriend and I usually order #65 (steamed catfish in a hot clay pot), #72 (flash fried calamari), and my favorite #88 (sweet and sour catfish soup). I love that we can get full, but it's still a light full, not heavy and greasy. Nothing like some fresh Vietnamese food to get you feeling right!

A friend and I discovered this place because we're always on the search for places that offer gluten free options. They have a large gluten free menu that I was very impressed with. We ordered the autumn roll, sweet and sour soup, lemongrass curry, and the coconut tapioca for desert. The food was GREAT! My favorite was the soup.   We went on a Saturday night at around 6:30pm, the place wasn't full but had a good amount of people. When we walked in we weren't sat or greeted by anyone. Since this was our first time, we made our way to the cash register assuming that's where we ordered. Told the man it was our first time, ordered our food. He thought we were ordering to-go since we ordered at the register, we told him no, we were dining in and then he sat us. After that, the service was great. The food came out quickly and the server was nice and attentive. To be fair, there was only one person taking the orders and another running the food.   Definitely will be coming back here because the food was just top notch. Highly recommended!

This was my first rock climbing experience ever and I'd have to say, it went great! I hadn't read any previous reviews on this gym, but the customer service was excellent. The front desk attendant (Zach) was also the person who gave us our intro into belaying. He was very through, patient, and friendly. After our short lesson, we were left to our own devices to explore. There were at least 3 different employees who asked if we needed any help or explanation - Zach even came back around to show us how to boulder some routes, super helpful!   Originally we had accidentally signed up for the lead class (NOT for beginners!) and paid the non-member fee of $35 for the class. However, when the confusion was realized (that we had no idea what we were doing) and all we needed was a day pass and intro lesson, the owner gave us vouchers for a free climb and gear rental.   The facilities look great, well maintained. Lots of varieties of bouldering and climbing walls. The labeling system was helpful to me as a beginner. I give it 4 stars because I haven't been to any other rock gyms to really compare. Definitely will be returning!

This place is SO GOOD. I love the bison burger, hands down the best burger I've ever had (and I'm from Texas, I know my burgers). I took my bf and his friend here and they also agreed - best. burger. ever.  It doesn't stop there, everything I have tried on their menu is delicious. I'm getting cravings just thinking about it!

My first time here, I really liked it. The service was excellent, the chef was super friendly and accommodating (I asked to have my cali roll with masago on top), and the prices were fair (didn't go during happy hour). I will definitely be returning!

I was interested in taking a boxing bootcamp class, did some research and found 1on1. Their pricing is reasonable, they offer monthly memberships, and they have multiple classes a day. The workouts are tough, usually there's a combination of boxing, circuit training, and Crossfit type stuff. The regulars who go to the class I went to were fun and made it a good time.   So why only 2 stars? When I started, our classes were ran by a young woman name Amy. Maybe it's just a style of training, but she always seemed completely disinterested or preoccupied with something else. Then a new trainer came, Justin, and he was much more involved and encouraging during the workouts. He listened to our feedback, modified the class occasionally to meet certain needs, showed us beginner versions of the exercises, etc. He was present and attentive. He'd throw in the occasional "good job" or "you're improving" along with the "push harder". Those types of details make the mentally/physically tough workouts something you keep coming back to.    But something happened. Justin stopped working there and it was back to Amy. And it was worse than before, she would run the class but be on her phone the whole time. Or she'd leave the room when we were doing a timed exercise and she'd have the timer! There were also those days where she would not play any music because she didn't want to listen to the radio. I'd especially look forward to the days when she'd tell us she designed that day's workout to make us throw up and proceed to sit on her butt the entire class on her phone texting/talking. She'd usually let us know that when she was training, she'd do what we were doing but 3x as hard, blah blah blah blah. I didn't realize all of this wasn't "normal" until I started at another boxing gym in the Valley.  When I decided to not return they had started with a new trainer for the bootcamp class. He seemed to be running the bootcamp class and some other classes at the same time, so he was stretched thin. Perhaps the same thing happened with Justin. Anyway, I didn't stay to find out.

All of the reviews here are so positive! I hate to be the debbie downer, but as the rating of two star means "Meh. I've experienced better", that's where I stand as far as this studio goes. I am not new to yoga, so perhaps I've been spoiled by previous studios. I was new to the valley and the great reviews of Spirit of Yoga led me to give them a try. I should preface by saying that I am more inclined to smaller yoga studios.   Pros: The place is definitely beautiful, very large studios with great interior design. The location is nice too, overlooking a small body of water with geese and ducks hanging out. They have a lot of classes at a lot times, so it makes it very convient to work some yoga into your schedule.   Cons: The place is busy, that's for sure. When I came for my first class I bought 5 class package, so I could give it a proper try before committing. The front desk was hectic and I was ignored for quite a few minutes before someone paid me any attention. They spoke to me like I should have known what to/where to go/etc. Anyway, I filled out my paperwork and was directed to the class. The room was large and the class was pretty full by the time it started.  The instructor led the class but stayed at the front of the class the whole time, which is understandable since it's such a large class not everyone can get personalized attention. However, I did notice that the instructors (in more than one class I attended) never corrected anyone on form, even with just voice instruction. I find this quite concerning because people can injure themselves in certain postures if not done properly. There are no mirrors, which is good and bad, in my opinion. Good because you're not distracted by watching others in the mirrors. But, bad since there were no corrections at least one could observe their body in a mirror to see if they're out of alignment.   The next two times I came back for classes the front desk couldn't find my paperwork or proof that I paid for the class.   My overall experience here left me wondering what else was out there.

Coal Burger offers a healthier spin on your normal fast food burger place, which is refreshing. You can satisfy your craving and not feel too guilty about it after. Also, they  are very eco-friendly, from the straws they use, to the materials their tables are made of, even the bathrooms stress green-ness.   I normally get the 1/3 coal burger on a gluten free bun with mixed fries. This amount of food always leaves me full, but not with the heavy feeling of a greasy meal. Which is something that I love about them - no nasty grease! The fries are cooked in rice oil, the beef is coal fired, AND they have gluten free buns?? It is really nice to have options when it comes to this kind of cuisine.   The service is great, everyone is friendly. My order is always comes out perfect, just like I ordered it.   I give the 4 star rating because I haven't tried a lot of other items on their menu.

My boyfriend and I decided to get pampered together and found Teres on Yelp. The interior of the bar is beautiful, very contemporary. They have definitely created a nice, relaxing atmosphere. Overall it was a good experience.   I really enjoy the way they do their services. When you come in, you get a "bar tab" where you check off what services you want. They've broken up all the different options (i.e. gel polish, nail art, hand massage, etc) so it makes everything more affordable, customizable, and you know exactly what you're getting. I got a manicure with gel polish and glitter and a normal pedicure. My boyfriend got the regular mani and a pedi with callus remover.   One thing I found strange was when I got my manicure, the nail artist I had cut and shaped my cuticles dry. Every place I've ever been to get a manicure involves soaking your skin in some warm water before the manicure begins. Is this something new? Is soaking your hands not actually apart of the manicure, but an additional item? Anyway, I have really dry skin so for her to cut and shape my cuticles while they were dry was kind of uncomfortable (a little painful and definitely ouchies when they used alcohol on them). The pedicure was done by a different nail artist and everything was perfect.   Tip: I got a free shea butter rub by checking in on Yelp!
