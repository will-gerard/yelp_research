Great neighborhood bar. Tucked behind a gas station in a business park.Stopped in with a couple of out of town friends who wanted a beer and a burger and someplace clean. Stopped in on a Tuesday night, place was pretty busy but didn't feel crowded.  As soon as we stepped in we were greeted enthusiastically by the staff and started feeling comfortable right away. Pretty fair mix of clientele but also generous amount of women so that tells you they feel safe and secure and are happy with cleanliness or they wouldn't bother. Big selection of sports across many different sized screens, you could see any game anywhere in bar or at the seating area booths and high tops. Our server Tiffany came over right away and took our drink order and returned quickly. She told us it was $1 taco Tuesday (big and worth it) and happy hour. If we wanted to play trivia we could enjoy happy hour during trivia. She recommended the grilled wings which also were very good and I recommend. We stayed a few rounds of trivia and enjoyed the company,drinks and food. If ever in the area I would return and do recommend if someone in the area or visitor is looking for quick and pretty good priced food and service.

BBW is a great place to take the family and have a beer and some wings,watch some sports and watch people.  Yes its mostly bar food but its good bar food. The main reason I go is the owner Gail gives back to local community and schools and is not greedy about sharing and helping others. I have never met her,wouldnt know her if I saw her but I have seen the things she has done for the local teams,schools and even churchs in this day of political correctness.  Thumbs up, thanks!

These tools want to charge $3 to enter just grab lunch and place a bet on the horses. I would avoid it just on that principal alone.
