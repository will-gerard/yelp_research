The 40$ for 25$ is a great deal!

The first time I attended this bar I requested that my tab be opened and my sisters card closed. They did the opposite, however they fixed the issue and released the charge on my card. I then went back for another round of drinks, "put it on my tab," and another a bit later. I ordered from a girl that had just began her shift,  she stated that she "didn't have a tab open for me." After about 2 or 3 times telling this woman that they had my card, they stated I would have to wait for the lights to come on before they would look thouroughly for it, I had to work the next day and had no intention of staying until close. This put me in a horrible mood, for about an hour I was sulking, finally the bartender informed me that he had found my card and he located it in the garbage can behind the bar after diggin through it. He comped my drinks I had ordered. *kudos  The next time I attended this venue I obtained a reciept for 15.00$ however I noticed while I was there that my bank account was charged 18.00$. I took this up with the bartender and he said he didn't know why it would show that and I would be charged 15.00$. I gave a $3 dollar tip in hopes I would be charged 15.00 + the 3.00$ tip.   Another night I attended I paid cash all night until my last drink, I got charged instead of 3.00$, 3.60$ AND WAS TOLD BECAUSE I USED MY CREDIT CARD I WAS CHARGED A TAX -__________-  OOPS caps lock :P  Last night I went and had purchased a groupon sort of coupon for $50.00, in which NOBODY was aware of until they verified with their boss (mind you I had mentioned the coupon last week as well). At 47.00 the bartender told me, I ordered 1 beer and was told by the same bartender I would be charged 1.00$. I would then leave a hefty tip. I got my bill and I was charge 8.60$. The bartender that gave me my receipt had disappeared and I was told he wouldnt be back for 10 minutes. I left a tip of 8.00$ but was very unhappy the rest of the night. i was compensated in shots for my time.... I asked him later why I wasn't charged only the $1.00 and he stated that he had put 1 bud light (mine) and a corona (a friends) on it. 4+1 does not equal 8.60$.... and why would he tell me I would only be charged 1.00$?  This place is a rip off whether it's the bad service (throwing away my debit card) or them trying to rip people off that have or haven't been drinking. I wish one of my favorite weeklies was not thrown here :(

The powers that may be ditched the bar staff that was charging patrons incorrectly. I haven't had any trouble since they have been gone and frequent this place again.
