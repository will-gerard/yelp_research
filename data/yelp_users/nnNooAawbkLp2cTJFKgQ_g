Tried Cyclo about four times.  I really liked it the first couple times.  But this last time I went, I brought a friend along who had never tried it.  I was kind of embarrassed by the service.  The food is consistently good as is the lemonade.  Their new decor is nice also.  But they really fell flat on their face with their service.  It seems like the waitress only takes the food orders, one of the cooks brought out the food so of course he don't know who gets what, they brought mine first, then a few minutes later my boyfriend got his and then our friend got her food.  When we finished eating we had half of our food left over that we were going to take home.  We asked her for boxes and she proceeded to stack all our plates on top of each other.  She brought our check and my boyfriend told her that we wanted to take our food home and she says "sorry, I didn't hear you" and left it at that.  We were disappointed and won't be back which is a shame.

Just visited today.  Was a very good experience.  Walked through several cars and saw passenger cars, sleeper cars, dining cars, cargo cars.  Rang the bell in the steam engine.  Had a nice time looking at the variety of old train cars.  Will be back.

I was in need of a newer car and terribly afraid of going to a dealership.  So after much research and talking to a couple salesmen on the phone I was starting to panic.  I decided to check Yelp.  I found LeSueur to have more good reviews than bad so I checked their website, found a car I liked and gave them a call.  I believe it was Steve who answered and he was pretty casual about selling cars and invited me over to try out the car I was interested in.  He didn't sound like a salesman at all which totally impressed me as I was so nervous to step onto a car lot.    When I arrived he greeted me and showed me a few cars and let me look around on my own.  I was able to test drive them alone which was great.  I chose a car in my price range and he even got me a better interest rate than my own bank offered me, they took my old clunker off my hands and I feel I got a great car that I love for a great deal.  I didn't feel trapped or pressured like I've heard from other people's horror stories with buying a car.  I don't like to haggle but it wasn't necessary since they have good prices as I have verified by looking up the fair market value of the car I purchased.  The transaction was pretty quick and easy.    While I was there, I learned that they are a family business, and they've been operating locally for over 30 years.  I'll totally buy my next car from them and recommend them to my friends and family.

I was kind of disappointed the first time I went with some friends for a quick lunch.  I ordered a veggie wrap and it was not very good, no flavor.  The beer was ok.  I decided to try it one more time as I live close by but again was not pleased.  The service was not so hot, the beer, ok again, we ordered pizza and it was mediocre.  We will not return.  I'll probably continue to driver over to BJ's at Chandler Fashion for consistently yummy food, great beer and pleasant service.

My boyfriend and I were looking for something near Chandler Mall that isn't a chain restaurant same old thing and found the perfect match here on yelp!  While people hungrily waited across the parking lot to get into Changs, we strolled in to Nouveau Bistro and were seated immediately.  We ordered the goat cheese and shrimp appetizer which was so yummy!  For entrees: he ordered the short ribs which was absolutely delish and oh so tender and I had the feta and spinach ravioli which hit the spot, it was very rich and flavorful without being overbearing.   The atmosphere is very nice without being stuffy.  My boyfriend commented on the lighting, it was dim with candles which gave it a more intimate feel.  The service was good.  I can't wait to go back again, I forgot to try the sangria!  :-)

I've been meaning to write this review for a while...  I love seeking out those special locally owned places to eat with my boyfriend that we can make our "go to" place when we want to grab a bite.  Pastis has never let us down.  Delicious food, a great selection. The first time we ate there I wanted something light.  I ordered the grilled balsamic portabella and boy oh boy was it really yummy!  I ate every bite and knew we had found one of those places we would be returning to.  The service is great, the owner is a really cool guy and yes he is charming as Phillip R. said.   The atmosphere is very comfortable and classy.  It has that special something about it.  We have recommended it to our friends and they agree with us that Pastis is the place to go when you want delicious food, a comfortable atmosphere and great service.

I was never a big fan of sushi, I've given it several tries and I just did not get what my friends loved about it.  This really changed when my fiance took me to Sushi San on Thursday night.  We had the spicy sashimi salad with scallops and the California rolls with baked crab on top.  It was served with some delicious miso soup, edamame, and fresh pineapple for desert.  Oh my the scallops and sashimi on the salad were so fresh!  I couldn't get enough of it!  I went safe with the California rolls and they were very yummy and the baked crab on top was decadent but next time I'm going to try something more adventurous!  The service is great, the atmosphere is very comfortable with great lighting (lighting is very important), we took our time and enjoyed ourselves.  I can't wait to go back!

I have been going to iWomen's Health Care for around 3 or 4 years now.  I found the office online and decided to give them a try.  Believe me, you want an office you like when it comes to your annual lady appointments.  For the first couple years I saw Vanessa and she was very nice, knowledgeable, and answered all of my questions.    It was time for my husband and I to start our family and I knew I would want a midwife to help me through my pregnancy and delivery.  We joined their group prenatal care which was way better than I imagined it would be.  We got to know several couples due around the same time and were able to learn together and talk about any concerns and have any questions answered by the midwives,  I really liked what I called, "pregnant group".  :-)   I neared the end of my pregnancy with confidence that I had the best birth team I could have and was certain that everything would be great!  And it was.  Tiffany Jackson went above and beyond when I went into labor.  Things didn't go according to our plan as babies don't care about birth plans.  :-)  Tiffany got to the hospital to make sure we were doing fine and took lots of time to discuss our options with us.  Throughout the labor and delivery she was absolutely wonderful.  She explained everything to us as it was necessary.  She answered any questions, and just put us at ease through the whole thing.  She is a terrific midwife who will definitely be catching my next baby.   The front office staff are always friendly, the back office staff are fun and always kind.  It's a great office and I'm very glad I found it.

Great food.  We have been a couple times with our toddler and she loves the rice and little chicken tacos.  Service could be better at host station.  One of them tried to push past my little one and I and didn't say excuse me.  Nearly bumped into us.  No manners.  Hipster waitresses were ok.  Pretty much what I expect from them.  Looking cool but not great at pretending they care that we have a good experience.  Still, the food is really good so we will be back again.

Slow, pricey, not a great waffle, we didn't end up eating it.  The fresh whipped cream was good though.  Went to grab a quick bite for my daughter and I at the Gilbert Farmers Market this morning.   Waited and waited, went and bought veggies, came back, waited, waited.  I am a patient person but man that was a crazy long wait for a waffle.  That's all they make!  They should have it down by now!  Lol!
