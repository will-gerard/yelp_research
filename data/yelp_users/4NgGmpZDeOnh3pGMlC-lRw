We live in a society of big corporations. ....not all bad, but the bigger you get sometimes the customer service suffers......I feel this is where Freeride shines......a local home grown shop with roots right here in the valley....BMX and bicycles became big in the 70s.....when you go to Freeride you'll instantly feel the vibe.....with fresh designs, combining new school with old school.....you'll be sure to find something that suits you and you'll be the envy of the block.....they pay attention to the little details and that's what sets them apart from others.....if you can dream it, they can build it....so get at them and check out what they have....you won't be disappointed. .....

Maybe I'm a pizza snob.....been eating it for over 25 years now......thought I would try something new.....I have my five or so great places.......I get a pie once if not twice a week.....read some reviews on yelp, thought I would give this place a try.....made the mistake of not going to their website.....ordered off of yelp.....35 bones for a pizza and 6 wings and a couple of knots........so not worth it.....wings were dry.....the sausage on pizza looked liked chopped up hot dogs.....I'm not one to complain on food....but when I'm dropping almost 40 bills on a pizza and six wings I better have a great experience.....I'd take a little ceaser hot and ready any day over this.....I try and support local mom and pop shops....but when a pizza costs almost half a C note.....your not reaching out to your mom and pop customers
