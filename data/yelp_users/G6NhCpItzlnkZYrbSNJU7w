Pro's: Friendly staff, well maintained beds and great location!  Con's: Every single door in the salon seems to be broken along with the door lock.

I had my oil changed at Sanderson and received excellent service! Logan was my service advisor, and I was very impressed with his friendliness, professionalism, and knowledge of product. After my oil change, he had a cool evaluation form filled out about my car, and informed me that everything was in top shape. Since my great experience, I have recommended this dealership to all of my family and friends. Sanderson and Logan definitely gained a customer for life!

This is a great salon: the bulbs in the beds are constantly being kept up, it is always VERY clean, and the staff is extremely educated about all things tanning related! Plus, they have an adorable boutique in the front of the salon!

I am a member at the Palm Valley club but dropped in for a quick yoga session while in the east valley and loved it! I took the Sunday morning Hatha class and really enjoyed it! I can't remember the instructor's name but she was great! I look forward to taking more classes at this club.   Life Time never fails to impress!

5 stars , obviously. Mastros NEVER ceases to amaze. Fantastic wine selection, love the scallops appetizer, best filets in the state, and be sure to get the butter cake for dinner. We are huge Mastros fans and my company uses this restaurant to recruit new employees... Regularly! Treat yourself and enjoy the deliciousness that is Mastros!

Delicious salsa and super tasty steak tacos! Service is a little slow though. The atmosphere in this restaurant rocks and I host business lunches here regularly.

Verrado Grille is wonderful! My family and I go here every single Friday for happy hour and dinner, and have never been the least bit disappointed. The service is great, the food is delicious, the drinks are tasty, and the views are breathtaking. Even if you can't get a table outside, the inside of the restaurant is just as gorgeous, comfortable, and lush; I suggest sitting in the bar area if you are going to sit inside! :)

I love this salon! Ha works magic with acrylic nails and Peter does an awesome job with pedi's! The salon is clean, friendly, and super easy to get an appointment at; as someone in the beauty industry, cleanliness is VERY important to me. I recommend this salon to all of my friends!

Lifetime IS as good as it gets! I love my gym! The staff is extremely friendly and the class instructors are great! I am a yoga fanatic and they offer multiple classes throughout the day which is really nice. I take yoga 5-6 times a week here and love it! The locker rooms are extremely clean; the entire club is very clean. I really enjoy working out here and refuse to work out anywhere else... I'm addicted!

I followed my stylist Christia here; she is absolutely amazing and truly listens to her clients! She transformed my faded, in-need-of-TLC hair color into the most beautiful balayage ever!! As far as the salon goes, it is in a great location and carries great product! Everyone that works there is super friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed yet upbeat... (i.e. no salon drama.)   Book your next appointment with Christia at downtown salon, she will not disappoint!

Ordered the Italian farm salad (one of my faves) to go... got all the way back to my office in Mesa and realized that my order was messed up. Instead of a big delicious salad I was given a tiny, meatless italian side salad and a piece of bread... which I paid $13 for. Never again :(

1 star because 0 stars is not an option...   After reading all of the positives reviews about this bridal store, I was thrilled to make a reservation here for my sister. The girl on the phone was very sweet and helpful.   *Keep in mind we are looking to spend approximately $2,500 or so on a bridal gown which is WELL above the average price of a gown here.   Fast forward to the day of our appointment:  We walk through the door and are completely ignored for the first 10 minutes. The girls at the front desk are busy gossiping so we decide to at least look around a bit and that's when one of the girls approaches us with a confused look on her face "Um.. Can I help you?" Caught off guard by a somewhat accusing statement, we tell her we have an appointment and she directs us to the front desk where we wait a few minutes for the girls to stop gossiping. We were then assigned an associate to help us; she asks the bride details about her wedding theme and her dream dress. We select dresses to try on and are directed to the fitting room/seating area.   My sister emerges from the fitting room in her first dress and the associate takes off; no questions about the dress or anything... back to the front to gossip. My sister stood there literally holding up her dress because the associate failed to secure the clamps so I promptly jumped up and helped her. After determining that the dress was not for her, my sister headed back to the fitting room, and that is when the associate showed up again.   After 6 gowns and 6 of the same exact experience, our very annoyed bridal party finally got up to leave the salon. On our way out I passed a girl headed to the fitting rooms with 4 dresses in her arms. A different associate from the store promptly walks up to her and asks "Where are you going?" to which she replied: "To try these on, I called this morning to ask if there were any openings and there were! The girl on the phone told me I could come in and try these on." The associate then rudely told the girl that she couldn't just try on dresses without an associate's help and that she would have to come back in 2 hours if she wanted to try anything on. The girl, who was about in tears and mortified, repeated her situation and that she was told she was allowed to try on dresses. The associate snapped back "You will have to speak with my manager." I was completely disturbed by the whole situation, it was like the movie Pretty Woman all over again.   I hate to post a bad review but our experience was horrible. If you are looking for the "bridal experience" this is not the salon. Our next appointment was at Lillian Lottie Couture; they were wonderful and helped us pick out the perfect gown.

Delicious, fresh and authentic! Portions are huge so be sure to bring a friend.... Or five! We split the pancetta, it was life changing! I really enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and live music. Be sure to check out this hidden gem!

Me (and my office) are obsessed with Salad and Go! This place just rocks, not only is it a healthy choice but a filling choice! The salads are a great size and about $6 each, service is fast and friendly, and the location is easily accessible. I can't wait to try their breakfast some time!

Love the patio, atmosphere, and overall feel of this bar; great place for day drinking! I personally didn't try any of the food but the friends I was there with did and really enjoyed everything they ordered. We will be back for sure!
