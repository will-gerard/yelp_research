Rokerij is my favorite restaurant in this part of town.  Everything i have tried has been quite enjoyable and the service is generally quite good. It does fill up at times so I recommend planning ahead for this.  The basement area is fun but I enjoy the atmosphere in the entire restaurant. The price is very reasonable given the quality of the food.  I can easily recommend Rokerij and find that it is a great value and dining experience.

Cowboy Ciao is one of my favorite Scottsdale restaurants. I have been visiting here since moving to town ten years ago and I can't think of a time I have been disappointed.  The food has always been quite enjoyable and service is always on point. The atmosphere is comfortable and not the standard thing you find at chain style restaurants.  Definitely one of the few spots that are on my short list of favorite restaurants in town.

I usually try to stay away from chain restaurants at malls but we recently visited this location after taking my daughter shopping. Definitely happy that we did.  Both of us found the food enjoyable and the service was quite good. The atmosphere was nicer than I was expecting from the outside and we enjoyed our visit.   We will try it again when we are in the area.

Tried this place with the little one after a visit to the mall.  We were both very disappointed. The food was absolutely terrible. Neither of us could eat more than a few bites and then we left.   I can in no way recommend this location and suggest going somewhere else.

I really enjoy this hidden gem. I wish someone had told me about it sooner. Food has always been enjoyable regardless of what I have tried and service is quite decent. Definitely a fun, cozy little spot to visit. Dick's Hideaway is on the short list of spots I like to visit while in this area but note that due to the size I suggest planning your visit well as it can fill up quickly.

This is one of the spots we really enjoy eating at fairly regularly in the North Scottsdale area.  The food has always been consistently good. The grilled artichokes appetizer is something we get every time we go and they are always quite enjoyable. Service has always been very good and its one of the few places I order dessert at, always enjoying their bread pudding (which I normally don't like). The dining area is nice and provides a nice atmosphere to enjoy your meal in.  If you are looking for a consistent American grill style restaurant in the North Scottsdale area that delivers your money's worth, White Chocolate Grill is a great choice.

After having a couple less than favorable dining experiences at the Fashion Square Mall location, I was in no hurry to try this location. But we were at the mall for some other things a couple months ago and decide to give this location a try.  I am glad we did. It is definitely a big step up from the Fashion Square Mall location and we have been quite happy with our experiences on the times we have been back since. The three different menu items I have tried have all been enjoyable and well prepared and the others in my parties have all complimented their food items.   The menu seems to have changed since the last time I was at a Yard House and it seems much better now. There is a great variety, so it is a good place to go with with people that have different tastes. The service has been quite good on our visits and they provide a comfortable atmosphere to dine in. The one exception is that it seems to get quite loud in the dining area.  I have no problem whatsoever recommending this location of the Yard House and foresee it working its way into the rotation of places we dine at on a regular basis.

I gave this place a second chance and had the same poor experience as I did the first time, leading me to believe there is a pattern.    The service is incredibly slow. There was only a couple of people in front of me and they seemed to be friends of the staff. So the staff decided to chit chat for an exceptionally long time rather than moving them through and helping me with my order. Definitely not happy with that, especially since it happened BOTH times I visited.   Next comes the food and I have to say I was very disappointed. The bread was very dry and stale. Really poor quality that I am surprised they actually served. This also happened BOTH times I visited. I couldn't really get beyond that to comment on any other part of the sandwich.  Needless to say,  I won't be visiting Jersey Mike's again and putting myself through a needlessly long wait to get stale bread. If I could give them negative stars I would.

Easily the best sub sandwich place in North Scottsdale.    Bread is generally quite fresh and the ingredients are flavorful. Typically I am very pleased with my order. A much better sub than the flavorless ones from Subway and a vastly superior experience to the stale bread and poor service at Jersey Mike's. Its really not even fair to mention those two in this review as Jimmy John's is vastly superior.  A big bonus is the delivery. Sandwiches are always delivered quickly.   I always wonder how the other sandwich shops are going to compete with the combination Jimmy John's has going on of good food, great service, low prices and fast delivery.  Well done Jimmy John's!

Tried Searsucker for a pre-opening dinner with some friends and was quite impressed.  Every dish we tried was quite enjoyable from various appetizers we got to the main courses to the desserts. The service was good given the circumstances of being a pre opening dinner and I'm sure its on point at this time.   I really liked the decor and it seemed a nice step up from a lot of the other spots in town. There was a "hipness" to it that I just don't see at a lot of the popular spots in this area that I certainly enjoyed.  The bar is quite good and the crafted cocktails are recommended.   We are definitely interested to try it again when we are down in that part of town.
