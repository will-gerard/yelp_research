We had to take our 12 year old cat here when we saw a bad infected gash behind his ear. To start, the front desk was super rude, unpleasant and not friendly. The young girls were acting like we were interrupting them on the job. The first doctor that saw our cat and spoke to us about treatment was also super rude, condescending, and just a plain jerk, Made us feel like we were bad pet owners if we didn't drop our life savings on things that he didn't even need! But, because we had no choice (all vets were closed being it was after hours) we had to leave our cat in their care. Dr Croooks was the main Doc on duty that night and took care of our cat throughout his whole procedure. Dr Crooks was super nice, and very kind to me and took his time explaining everything when i picked up my cat the next morning.  My recommendation, is if you HAVE to go here, try and see Dr Crooks.

Love Love LOVE it!!! Pure Barre is great! I'm not your usual Pilate's or yoga gal, but this workout totally got me hooked! As an avid crossfitter, I was wondering if it was going to be enough for me, and wow! it was. my legs and abs were shaking like never before!  The instructors are all AMAZING and love how they max out a body part and then slowly stretch it out.  LIFT, TONE, BURN is right!!!

Great place!  Loved the atmosphere and the staff was great!  The GM even cane up abs asked how everything was and then sent us over their #1 dessert (fire side smores), at no charge. Can not wait to return to this establishment!
