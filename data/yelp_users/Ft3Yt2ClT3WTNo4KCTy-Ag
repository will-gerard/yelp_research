I don't understand why anyone likes this place.  I ordered the fresh pasta and found it heavy and tasteless.   It is also very expensive considering for what I paid here I can dine in much better places.  I find the Food Network sign on the outside a little tasteless also.

Stay away.  It is dreadful.  Starting with the greasy apps and on to the Thai Chicken made with frozen French fries.   when I asked the manager he said because fresh potatoes take to long to cook.   Really??

I have been loyal to Pruitt's  for years but after this last ordeal will not shop there any longer.   I purchased a recliner that was a floor model and was wobbly.   I wa promised that it would be fixed before delivery' but it was delivered broken.    Then I scheduled a technician to come out and fix it.   He ended up taking it back to fix it and I cannot get it delivered because I work and cannot be home for delivery on their schedule.   They said if I return it they would charge a 20% restocking fee.   So I still do not have my recliner. Worst customer service ever.

Great shows here.  I have done improv before, but this takes it one step beyond, as I have only done short form.   Long form improv is challenging but I love learning it.  I am taking Level I and find my teacher Nina to be very supportive. The shows really showcase remarkably talented players. The entire group is dedicated to improv and do it for the love and passion they have.

I went there because I crave the veggie tacos.   I ended up with the guac, which is delicious and the chicken soup.   It came with lots of fresh herbs and it was the perfect thing that satisfied me.   It is a Vietnamese influenced soup and very tasty. So, tacos another day.

The food here is extraordinary.  I had the chilaquiles benedict and they were swoon worthy.    I did not give it 5 stars because the noise level in the restaurant is painful.  I have slight hearing loss (as do many of us) and the ambient noise is magnified and conversation is impossible.  If noise is not an issue for you, I am sure you will give it 5 stars.

STAY AWAY!!!!!!!   They are scam artists.  They have a new drive thru car wash.   I was sold the introductory package for $14, regular $30 for 30 days.   I WAS TOLD VERBALLY I could cancel at any time, no problem.  That was on 9-21.   Decided I would cancel before the 30 days because I would not use it that much.  Oct. 1 rolls around and I was charged $30.   I went in mad as hell and was told, 30 cancellation notice in writing.  I signed the paperwork.  I was not given the paperwork because it had to be turned into corporate. I would say big scam.    STAY AWAY....SCAM ARTISTS.
