Awesome!  I am a high fan of this place. First of all, this place is has more people than an unemployment office when its busy. I have not tried their Pizza but the Pizza looked great as I walked in line. I tried their Ice cream sandwich desert! wow! The fresh chocolate chip cookie along with vanilla ice cream was a huge compliment with my amazing iced Mocha. This place rocks! I can't wait to dine in!

Wow! This place has gone way down! First of all eating sushi in Arizona is a horrible idea! Where is the ocean and how long do they leave the sushi out?? Between the loud music and fairly attractive staff, basically, your paying for the drinking and the view. Please do not eat at this place. I hade a common california roll, dragon roll, sashimi , and a vegas roll. They were all warm!! I could taste just dead fish. What do you expect for sushi in the desert? Overal, great and fun atmosphere the place was dark and looked like a fashion show, but sapporo should just be a bar. I gave it two stars because the music and entertainment was good.

Help them please!!  I should not have my hopes up for Arizona in the first place since this state has arguably the worst selection of dinning in the United States. I have been a Pizza fanatic most of my life and let me tell you that when something is wrong you can taste it! First of all I have been to chicago several times and had the pleasure of eating a real chicago style pizza. Let me break it down to all of you. I ordered a thin crust since that was all they had, but I was expecting a Deep Dish selection since that is the Chicago signature dish. Little Chicago had only one selection of pizza. I felt bad for them. The Sauce was salty (New York Style) and the difference between chicago style sauces is that the sauces are always sweet. Not Little Chicago. The thin crust dough was bland. Most Chicagoans use cornmeal in the crust. Probably on of the worst tasting paper crust that I have ever tried to eat. The cheese was burnt on top and mush underneath. I don't know who is running this place, but its a good place to go if your drunk and have no passion for flavor. Worst Pizza In Arizona next to Rosati's. I hope they change their menu or close down soon better, yet change the damn name because this is not Chicago style pizza!!!

First of all, judging outside this place seemed to be great because it was packed, but what do you expect in a college community? Secondly, the website is a wreck!!! The website almost looked like fake food as if they had no pride in their own dinning style and coupons available on the website??? Not a good sign. Now for the dinning experience. The atmosphere was loud, but I like busy places and eating at popular restaurants. The deep dish pizza took a little too long, but 45 minutes is acceptable if you want quality deep dish pizza. Service was good and the restaurant was clean for being busy. Once the pizza arrived, I smelled cornmeal which was a good sign. Unfortunately, The crust was crunchy but the temperature and dough was off because the flavor was limited to a smoked dough. I would have liked to taste more of the cornmeal flavor in the crust.  The sauce was horrible!! no indication of italian seasonings in the sauce such as basil, rosemary, parsley, or garlic. I felt robbed. Not only was the sauce bland, but the cheese was something one would buy from a Grocery market! no flavor!! If I were to say anything positive it would be that the best part about pizza chicago was the crust, but my favorite all time chicago style close to the west coast is "LITTLE STAR PIZZZA" in California, also known as  "Kiley's Pizza" in Seattle. The owner should consider going to Little Star Pizza in California to see what and how he needs for improving his restaurant. If this is just a business to him, then I understand because college kids would eat anything. I love pizza and I know that Arizona is dying to have a decent authentic style pizza place. In my opinion, The best chicago style pizza in Chicago is Genos East and Lou Malnatis. You can't expect a college town pizza place to live up to the authenticating standards of cultural food. Nice try Pizza Chicago, but unimpressed this time.
