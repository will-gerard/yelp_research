ever been to dick's last resort? you know, the restaurant we're the servers are intentionally angry and mean because its funny (kinda) and its the theme? well, this should be majerles theme cuz the service is horrid, horrid, horrid. ive never had even mediocre service there. in fact, most of their "servers" seem to lack a pulse...something that should be manditory for the position. how these people survive on tips is beyond me...americans are just generous people i guess.

One of my favorite places to get a brew and relax. Great neighborhood feel and always some locals drinking alone at the bar chatting with the bartenders. And I'll tell you what, I love a place where I feel comfortable enough to have a beer by myself without feeling like a raging alcoholic. Very mixed crowd where everyone is welcome. Definitely the right mix of dive bar and neighborhood hangout.

Created a YELP page because I was annoyed with this place. Maybe they have great coffee but thats not my beef with them.   I saw they were listed as a great place to smoke a cigar and have a cup of jo. Understanding that some great places do not allow cigars (4Peaks, The Yardhouse...), I called them and said "I understand you guys are cigar smoker friendly?''. The woman on the phone answered, "Yes". When I inquired on a smoking area she said "Just keep them as far away from us as possible". Rude.  Thats not "cigar smoker friendly" at all! A simple, "Actually, we do discourage patrons from smoking cigars" would have sufficed. I would have even still went for a simple cup of coffee.  Again, maybe their coffee is great...but I'll never know for sure now. Drink Lux!

Great place to hang out. Real neighborhood-y. Usually able to find some great conversation at the bar with total strangers drinkining alone. Great place to head over to if the Roosevelt's servers are angrier than normal.  Greatest strength: Dogfish Head 90 on tap! This is actually responsible for 90% of why I love going to Carly's.

very cool place for a laid back night out with a few friends. its cozy and comfortable. generally bathrooms sway my opinions greatly. they had an awesome bathroom. moreover, i love how they take ikea stuff and make it look cool. everytime i try that it looks like a cluttered college dorm room. kudos.  "i cant decide if its the decor or the ambiance."

I came across these guys on a quick Google search. I was walking around with a cracked 3GS screen for months that was getting worse with each passing day.   I was expecting to pay about $100 for a new screen which is why I waited so long.  However, when I brought it to Gotronics it was only $60- star #1! The guy at their kiosk, Paul, was a very personable guy who made me feel very comfortable with leaving my precious iPhone in their hands- star #2! Then it was done in 45 minutes- star #3! When it came back it was like new again. No more cut-up ears from talking on my broken phone- star #4!  The only reason I didn't give these guys the coveted 5th star is because it took me about 10 minutes to find them in the mall. I think I actually walked past them a couple times before I realized lol.  Thanks guys, I would recommend your services anytime!

for a fast food burrito this place kicks butt over chipotle. the steak is incredible and cooked before your eyes (along with the tortilla). i love how they mix all of the ingredients together before they wrap the burrito. plus, the kids working inside are always really nice. take a day off from chipotle college brats and give it a try...its a freaking burrito, how could you not like it?

My wife and I recently visited since we live in the neighborhood. Both of us had visited before separately but it had been some time.   My main complaint boils down to lackluster service. We were looking for a semi-quick bite and to get on with our Sunday. We noticed the menu said that they had happy hour on Sunday so we ordered some adult beverages and appetizers. I then ordered a their Luau Pork Sandwich and my wife ordered the Pork Tacos from the happy hour menu (so we thought).   When the bill came it was quite large. Turns out only drinks were on happy hour. I am sure there was something that noted that fact but it obviously was not obvious since we both did not know this. In my opinion the server should have done a better job explaining the menu and happy hour deals instead of walking up and saying, "Can I get you something to drink?" I'm not looking for a line-by-line explanation of the menu but perhaps a quick overview of what is going on inside the 4-walls; especially when we order some things that any other day would be on happy hour. The server really just didn't seem to want to be there.  Nothing was horrendous about Hula's I just left feeling a bit bamboozled. Probably won't be back.

If you're not in to the whole salon feel and just want a good ol fashioned barber shop (like me) than this is a great place for a cut!  I have never had such detail and attention paid to cutting my hair. Probably 20 minutes was spent shaping up my hairline to make sure I was "fresh 2 death". Plus its right next door to Mamma Mia so you can grab a slice if theres a wait. I will DEFINITELY be back to Brooklyn Barbershop!

These guys are great! They treat their customers like friends. I have been in before to pick up some hockey equipment for a good deal. I realized I needed some legs guards for a game that same night. I was coming from the gym so I did not have my wallet and did not have time to get it before they closed. After I found the guards I wanted they told me to take them and I could come back and pay later. Its businesses like these that deserve support from the community and neighborhood. Definitely will be back.

My wife and I just bought a house in central PHX and had quite a few bugs both dead and alive since the house had been uninhabited for a while. We called 'The Bug Guy' to relieve of us of our unwanted house guests and he did a fine job. He is a very nice guy and an even better bug guy. After he left we saw virtually none of our former friends. We will definitely have him back for a 3 month checkup to make sure we stay bug free! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!

I would kill for this brisket and then request it for my final meal on death row. In fact, I would kill myself if I found out the good Lord above served this in heaven. The cheesy, jalepeno grits are also incredible.
