Recently I had Alaskan air conditioning come to my house because my heater was acting up. After researching different options on Google, I came across Alaskan! I must say, I am very impressed. The next day, they came out immediately and took care of everything-for a good deal too I might add! I highly recommend!

I go to butters at least once a week. Butters ALWAYS gets my food out within 10 minutes and it's ALWAYS delish. If it wasn't 30 minutes from my house, i'd go to Butters every morning. First, the eggs are absolutely unreal; heart eyes forsure. The protein pancakes are amazing and so is the turkey bacon, I get the same meal every time and it never disappoints. I couldn't imagine all the other dishes Butters has, tasting less than perfect!   The only downfall would be their policy on dogs, and how they aren't allowed on the patio!

Literally most unorganized place. Waited an hour and they couldn't find any of the files of the dogs I wanted to look at. Only reason I gave them any stars was because they rescue animals. However, some of the areas poor dogs were staying in were gross and had poop everywhere, walking in their own feces.

I like coming to the Attic on Wednesdays for burger nights. I love the atmosphere and the burgers are always delish. However, tonight's experience started rather rocky. First, walking into the lobby there was some confusion with how I was supposed to get a table and put my name on the list. There was no hostess, so a waitress approached me and I simply asked "do I put my name at the bottom?" And she replied, "I mean that's usually how lists work" in a condescending tone. Eventually, we got seated at the outside corner of the patio. I was cold, so I asked the manager (who sat us) if there were heaters available, her response was less than hospitable. She informed me, they did in fact have heaters but that "people would freak out if they were turned on", completing undermining my request, luckily, the company I was with offered me one of their garment layers. Our waitress then approaches us and coincidentally happens to be the same one who had the snippy remarks to make when we tried to get a table in the first place. We order our food. I ordered the Ivan, as usual, and once I got my food the patty was ice cold and tasted rather odd; my stomach turned and I couldn't bare to finish. Our waitress didn't visit our table often and had attitude the whole time. Fortunately, the burger was taken off our tab and I will think twice next time before returning to The Attic.

When I go to f√†me I always get their breakfast wrap and it never disappoints ! Also, I will get a vanilla latte, extra foam, and they always make it perfectly. Service is exceptional. Definitely a favorite go-to for brunch.

After a late start to my day, and in need of a late lunch, I decided to check out Radish at DeSoto Market. I must say, so so so delicious. The people who worked at Radish were so friendly and helped me pick just the right option. I chose the Grilled Salmon and Multi Grain bowl, which was light, fresh, and healthy... just what I needed! I'll definitely come back.
