I LalaLOVE this place!! I've been on this crazy Thai kick for a long while now and after trying so many places that were decent but not too amazing, I found this place! THIS IS MY THAI SPOT now!   My friend and I decided to go here for lunch and it was pretty busy. But we were seated quickly and ready to order. We got the spring rolls (1 came with the lunch menu item) which were so delicious and crispy. For our entrees, we got the pad thai and the red curry. Both dishes were amazing. But the pad thai was our favorite, which is a big deal to us since I don't really like pad thai that much. The curry was a little spicy but it was so creamy and flavorful. The veggies were perfectly cooked and the tofu wasn't soggy. The pad thai was loaded with veggies and again the tofu was not soggy. It was such a great dish.   Service was good. Our waitress was sweet and prompt.  The food is inexpensive for the quality.  We can't wait to come back.   Oh and I love the name of this place. "The wild THAIger." Rawr! So clever.

I gave this place a second try because i figured maybe we got all the wrong stuff the first time. Also because my friends are always raving about this place. So we went back to try the deep dish and waited over 45 minutes for a table (what a waste) and after ordering and praying it was gonna be as amazing as everyone says it is, it was....  DUSGUSTING!! I barely finished one slice. This place is SO OVERRATED. I think food out of a garbage  just might taste better. All I know is if I had the option to eat at this place or the gargage, garbage would be my solid number one choice.

I wish there was a way to give ZERO stars. I don't get how this place has good reviews because it is god awful!! This was my second time at this shit joint and I regretted spending $9.  I called for a pick up on a rainy cold day in the valley of the sun and a guy named Daniel answered. He was extremely unpleasant and was not willing to explain anything to me. He was rushing me and was EXTREMELY rude. When I asked him the difference between potstickers, he told me to hold on and put someone else on the phone to help. The girl who got on the phone was a lot nicer. I got some veggie (sansei?) udon soup as did my co worker.   When we picked it up, the girl at the front couldn't figure out how to split the check. Good thing she's not a rocket scientist. When we finally left and got back to the office, we opened the lid and it smelled AWFUL! She ate a spoon full and spit it out. I thought she was being over dramatic...until I tasted it. Then I yelled at her for being under dramatic. It was absolutely DISGUSTING. We couldn't even take a second bite before we passed it onto our coworker.  Twice here and twice unimpressed. Bad Service and bad food. No thanks.  And Daniel is lucky I didn't chew his dumbass out for the way he talked to me. And he's even luckier I won't be going back.

This is by far one of my favorite spots!!   It's kind of hidden near the theater area, so it can be hard to find. The inside is dark and chic. It's classy and trendy. This place is for almost everyone, there are hipsters and the "I live in the biltmore estates" and just regular people. It's great! It's perfect for when you don't feel like having a wild night and just enjoying a quieter night with friends. Their drinks are Delish! And so are the appetizers! Service is awesome! Music is good!  Awesome place all around!

My boyfriend took me here for our Valentines day dinner, and I was impressed! Our reservation was for 8:30, but they were running a little behind so we sat the bar for some champagne. The hotel itself is gorgeous! And the restaurant did the place justice! It was gorgeous as well! They had the piano playing songs from way back in caveman ages to 2013 music. That was refreshing! And the decor was beautiful. The only recommendation I have is dimming the lights a little more.   We finally got seated and our waitress, whom was lovely,gave us the valentines day dinner menu which consisted of 4 courses, dessert, and intermezzo(sp). Course 1: oyster with caviar...AMAZING!! Course 2: lobster pieces with some kind of creamy white sauce...magnificent!! It was so tender and flavorful! Course 3: Cauliflower soup....best soup I have ever had! I must learn to make this at home!! It was so creamy and rich!! Intermezzo: orange sorbet...delicious! Can't ever go wrong with orange sorbet.  Course 4: porter house steak for 2....it wasn't as great as I imagined it to be, but I also like my steak medium rare an we got this steak as medium well. The seasonings were just right.  Dessert: guava ice cream which was very tart and tasty and I don't even like guava. Also spongy cake pieces with apricot and orange marmalades which was my favorit, and this chocolate mousse cake! It was all so good!   It was a lovely dinner! The staff was amazing! The place was amazing! Can't wait to be back!

My boyfriend took me here on my birthday and it was AMAZING! I cant even remember what we ordered but everything we got was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! our waiter was great. So friendly and engaging. His recommendations were fantastic. The view was spectacular. We went at night, but the view would be even better if you went during sunset (az does the best sunsets!). Its pricey but well worth it! You are getting 5 star food for your dinero! I highly recommend this place! YUM!

I was really turned off to a Rays at a different location a year ago because they used canned mushrooms, so I was hesitant to go here when my bf suggested to go to Rays again when I told him I was craving a large slice of greasy cheese pizza.. Luckily, this location is the closest to him.   We walked in and it had a super NY feel to it. The guy who took our order was super grumpy and so was the pizza chef, but they were so entertaining and as weird as it sounds, it made the place even more authentic. While most people would complain about the rudeness and all, I happened to appreciate and so did my bf.   We got the "small" order of garlic knots and the 2 slice and drink combos. What a great deal! The garlic knots took a while but it was definitely worth the wait. They were the best we have tried. And the marinara sauce was delicious too. The order was HUGE!! I couldn't believe that was considered a small. It can be shared by 2 or 3 people. The pizza was AMAZING! They were slices of heaven! It was exactly what I had been craving.   Can't wait to go back. New York City pizza in Phoenix :)

This place was recommended to us by an Italian girl, so we were thinking it has to be good if an Italian girl loves this place!  Off we go...  The place is a little hard to find. It's in a crappy smelly strip mall. We walked in and it was almost like walking into someone's home with a the family oil paintings and stuff. We were seated in the maiming dining area. While the decor was outdated, it was refreshing to see some authenticity to the place. You don't see that anymore.   The bread they brought out was delicious! it was hot and smelled of heaven! I ordered the spinach ravioli and my boyfriend got something garlic fettuccine. We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer. A huge portion of it came out and it was by far the best freaking calamari I have ever had! It tasted fresh! Sooooo good! Then to our surprise, they brought out salads, apparently it came with the dinner. It was delicious! I loved the dressing and it had beets in it which I don't like but for some reason, it was delicious with the salad and dressing. Then our dishes came out and we were hoping they weren't too big of portions or too small, they ended up being just perfect! Our dishes were freaking delicious! The noodles tasted like they had just been made!! Mine was so flavorful but not over the top, and I tried my bf's and it was garlicky and delicious! We were very pleased!   Service was good. Server was informative and polite.  No complaints!   We will definitely be back!!

I'm super happy I chose this place! I see Dr. Devine and he is absolutely amazing!! He comes in so politely and makes you feel very comfortable. As someone who knows a thing or two about medicine, I can tell he is extremely knowledgable and actually enjoys what he does. He takes his time to make sure he gets everything you say and at the end he reads over his notes and double checks to make sure he didn't miss anything. He is so genuine and caring. I don't dread going to the Doctor as much as I did before.

I really dislike this location! This was the second time I came here and the second time I hated it. The one on 16st is so much better!   Anyway, we came here early in the day when it wasnt too busy so the service was good. The bread wasnt very good or fresh. I got my usual which is the fresh tomato mozzerella which is amazing at the other location. And my bf got the creamy asparagus or something like that and they came out immediately. Now, I like fast service but too fast service means the food is old. Anyway, everything was all well and then the aftermath was awful. I ended with a headache and stomachache, overall really sick.   Do yourself a favor and go to a different location, this location has the worst rating out of the rest, so that should tell you something.

I don't even know where to start...  I'm trying not to gag as I write this. Anyway, my 3 girlfriends and I went to Olive Garden where there a 1.5 hour wait. I wasn't about to wait that long for less than mediocre food. So I, of course, yelped and saw this place with good reviews. When we arrived here, we were told there would be a15-20 minute wait. That's fine, we put our names down...40 minutes later we got a table. I checked in and received a free appetizer. Cool right!?...WRONG! It was awful! The appetizer was the 6 wings and 6 onion rings plate...the chicken barely had any sauce and it wasn't even cooked. The onion rings...I couldn't tell if there was onion in the breading because it was all bread! Needless to say, we barely touched it.   Onto the entree's: I got the spinach manicotti, one of the girls got the chicken Marsala, and another one got the ziti. Mine was bland, plain, and not good, at ALL. I hardly ate. My friend barely touched her chicken Marsala, she said it lacked flavor and the chicken wasn't cooked well. My other friend said her ziti was "ok."  The service was ok. As we were tipping, our waitress was just standing there watching us. AWKWARD.  This place was super disappointing. Next time, we'll wait for Olive Garden.

My friend and I wanted a couple of drinks and Cheesecake Factory was packed so we decided to come to elephant bar since it was right next door. There was no wait and the bar was empty (not a good sign). We ordered our drinks; I got the jungle colada and she got the Mai tai. They were both ok. Nothin special.   I decided I was a little hungry but not enough for a whole entree. I'm a sucker for a good Mac and cheese so I got a side of Mac and cheese hoping it would be amazing. And my friend got the Thai high salad. When our food came out, my Mac and cheese looked good but her salad was a bagged salad wth fancy wok'd chicken nuggets in it. What kind of "trendy" restaurant serves bagged salad? Or chicken nuggets instead of nicely sliced chicken? Then I take a bite of my Mac and cheese and it was most definitely boxed Mac and cheese. I tried to eat a few bites but I just couldn't. It was horrible.   My friend and I were extremely unsatisfied with everything. We left disappointed. Next time we would rather just wait an hour for the cheesecake factory bar.

I really hate their food. Everything is disgusting. The wings, the shrimp, the oysters, EVERYTHING. We went there and I love fish and chips so I ordered it. One bite and I was done. It was awful. Puke worthy awful. I ended up only eating the curly fries that came with it. Anyway, the manager noticed I didn't eat any of it, so he decided to take it off our bill which was super nice. It was one star food, but because the manager was nice enough to acknowledge the fact that I didn't like it so I shouldn't have had to pay for it, was why they got another star. Way to go on customer service!

Restaurant is nice. We got the #2 enchilada plate which is the shredded beef enchiladas and the Monterrey plate. Everything was pretty disgusting. It tasted like what my cats food smells like. We had a bunch left overs that we had no desire to take to go. I ended up feeling sick to my stomach later in the night. The only decent thing they had was the chips and salsa.

I have been driving by this place for over 5+ years and never bothered to try it; Except yesterday. I came to find out that I would have went on with my life by never going there and not missing much.  I came here for lunch with my co-workers so they could try Persian food. When we arrived, it was pretty dead. We were seated and handed the menus...as I was looking, I was expecting Cholo Kabab, Ghormeh Sabzi, Gheimeh, etc...instead I found TOFU, GRILLED CHEESE, and everything else that was not Iranian!  I am pretty certain tofu doesnt even exist in Iran. They did have doogh (Iranian yogurt drink), so that was good. I was so disappointed. We got the hummus and it was lacking flavor and was super runny. The bread, which the waitress called NAAN (it's called noon) but it wasn't naan or noon or pita bread..I don't know what it was. I do know it wasn't good. One of my coworkers go the chicken kabob plate, I got the shish kabob plate with half rice and half shirazi salad, and my other co worker got the BZ (or DZ) stew. My kabobs were chewy, my salad was overly sour and had too much dried mint, and the rice tasted old. My coworker didn't really like his stew either.   The service was extreeeeeemely slow. One of the girls brought the wrong food to our table...mind you, there was only 2 tables. And the prices are pretty up there for bad food. I won't be going back.

Having a class at Phoenix College from 1 to 2 works out pretty well for the fat girl trapped inside of my skinny body. I'm on a mission to try new places everyday after class since it's near central Phoenix. Anywayyyy, I have passed by this place a bunch of times and I finally decided to look it up on yelp...it had such good reviews on yelp! I was so excited to try it!   After class, I drive my happy ass down there and I walk in and thought it was closed...I was going to get my order to go but I had time to kill so I decided to have it there. I went with the margherita pizza.   So there were cons with my experience but the one that took the cake was this: a lady (I presume it was the owners wife) and some guy were sitting there having some sort of meeting about getting new wines...this lady looked like she had done meth for too long and botched plastic surgery; what a bitch she was. She was talking down to the girl in front, she was discussing the fact that she wanted to fly to Texas and beat her kids ass (how pleasant. At that moment I wanted to beat her ass). Then she starts talking about how DUMB college graduates are these days...umm...hello! College graduate here! Then she makes eye contact with me and asks me what I ordered. So weird. The guy sitting there was nice though. I felt bad for having to deal with her. The owner was there...he didn't say hi to me. He didn't ask how the pizza was, he didn't do anything. Maybe I'm spoiled but owners usually love me...especially Italian ones.   Onto the pizza. It was good. It wasn't anything spectacular. I've had better. I wouldn't ever go out of my way to go there. Actually I wouldn't even go there if I ran into the place. So disappointing!

My favorite Thai place out of all the ones I tried. The sweet and sour chicken was delicious! It was the perfect amount sweet and sour. The Thai basil beef was amazing. You could taste the basil and it was a great amount of spicy! And the last last dish was a beef dish with lots of veggies which was also delicious. The service was great. The prices were great. We were definitely happy. This spot is our pick for good Thai and I'm surprised it doesn't have better reviews.

I remember walking here with my friend back when we were kids and I also remember how much I use to love it. Then I moved to Glendale and never came back...until recently!   Upon arrival, it looked exactly the way I remembered it to. Big place, lots of seating, and almost empty...(nostalgic). Apparently, its more popular for pick up orders. Anyway... We take a seat and I am screaming on the inside eager to order! I always get the same thing, the beef lo mein. My friend got the kung pao chicken and we got a plate of veggies to share. The lo mein was as delicious I remembered it to be and the veggies were crisp and tender. So good! The kung pao chicken was good too, it just needed some more sauce. The peanuts gave it a nice crunchy texture to it. The portions are huge and the prices are low. For being 110lbs, I eat a lot and I finished my entire plate..I think the waitress was surprised because I always get the "where does it all go?" look. Hey, it was delicious, what can I say!?  I can't believe its taken me over 12 years to come back here! Needless to say, I will be coming back for often! Definitely my favorite Chinese  restaurant...yes, better than PF Changs gross ass food.  P.S. Their lunch menu is great! $5.50 for lunch!? Yes, please.

The last time I came to this place was over 5 years ago and they had good food and good service. HOWEVER, today was a different story. I wanted to take my best friend here for breakfast and here is how it went....actually it didnt go anywhere...  we walked in and were greeted by a young man when 2 seconds later sam came over and they ignored us and started bickering in front of us. Then i told the guy we wanted to sit outside and he had to ask same which i didnt understand why considering the restaurant was nearly empty. As we were waiting for him to return, another waitress asked if we were being helped and at the point same and the guy were walking back to us bickering. Finally, we were being taken to the outside seating area when I heard sam mutter something. So rude. When we were finally seated, the table was dirty! WTF! it wasnt busy so i dont get WHY they had any dirty tables! So the guy who seated us was gonna go get a bus boy to clean it, we waited for about 10 minutes, when tito came and questioned my english. First off, I dont want to be greeted with "YO", I am not your homeboy, second, there wasnt enough people for us to be called "y'all". It was annoying, so when we told him NO we arent ready to order because our table wasnt cleaned off, he told us he was gonna go get someone else to do it. At that point, we were irritated and just got up and left.   Looking at most of these reviews, I dont understand why management doesnt fix this service issue. All you have to do is hire servers that have high school diplomas and BAM! problem solved.

I went here on a sunday after a hard night's partyin' and I am so glad I did... i had THE BEST BRUNCH of my life here! Like seriously!  I can't even remember what everyone got but we stuffed our faces and couldn't stop talking about how delish everything was.   I do remember what I got tho...I got the banana foster breakfast...and HOLY MOTHER OF ALL THINGS DELICIOUS!!! It was UH-AMAZING! Everyone was eating off my plate until I nearly chopped off hands!   Only complaint I have is that the Bloody Mary wasn't good. But I will not deduct a star because...well...with something as delicious as that darn Bananas Foster, to hell with the Bloody Mary!

I'm not really a big fan of Mediterranean/ Iranian (and im iranian, lol) food so I'm very picky about the food. My order here is always the same and they always deliver it well!  The gheimeh stew which is phenomenal! With half shirazi salad and half rice. The rice is super fluffy and delicious. I love basmati rice. The shirazi salad is perfect! Just the right amount of spices and lemon!   However, I've heard almost everything is delicious on the menu, especially the filet mignon.   The staff is really nice also and price is decent! The place is super gorgeous!   Doo dooo dooo Iran! (Iranian chant)

I came here last night to see Maz Jobrani, my favorite comedian. And I don't know if I'm giving it 4 stars because I had a blast or because Of how I felt about the venue.   All the opening acts were hilarious. I haven't laughed like that in a long time and I laugh a lot!    Onto the food and drinks...I got "the cure" which was a form of Bloody Mary, just fancier. But it was good...however it was $14. Yikes! I got 2. I also got a side of fries which were ok. They were just fries and it was the same for their sweet potato fries. I also got the spinach and artichoke dip to nosh on during the show, but it wasn't anything to rave about either.   The thing I don't like about this venue is the seating. The have community tables and well I don't like being part of the community. I like to sit in my bubble with my friends without having to worry about offending anyone (I have a potty mouth).   After reviewing my review, I think the 4 stars is for the show. I had a blast! Can't wait til next year!

My new favorite Persian restaurant!! My mom, sister, and I came here for lunch and I'm glad we did. We were greeted by a nice older gentleman and we were seated outside. He warned us of bees, but my sister wanted to enjoy the weather since she is visiting from NY.  Onto the food. My mom ordered the lab kabab with half rice half salad, which was delicious! I don't really like lamb, but this didn't taste bad at all. My sister got the koobideh plate, which she loved. And I for the chicken kabab with koobideh plate. I don't usually like koobideh either because it has too many flavors but theirs was amazing. It has the perfect amount of spies and it's soooooo juicy! Yum! The chicken was amazing too. It was so tender and juicy. It was perfectly grilled too. The only thing that was "eh" was the rice. I'm picky about rice. The house doogh was excellent. I love doogh!  And for dessert, we got the faloodeh, which we weren't charged for because they had run out of a full serving. But it was delicious! So sweet! So good.  The service was great. The prices are good especially for how much food you are getting. This place isn't as nice as Persian Room, but the food is much much better.

I love this place! It's hipster/motorcycle "bary" so I definitely feel out of place when I go there, but who cares! Their oysters are frikkin delicious! They are always soooo fresh and at $13 for a dozen, you can't beat that! Their horseradish is probably made from the devils flesh because it is so damn hot, but so damn good! It is probably my favorite place in Tempe.  Go here. It's cheap. It's good. It's fresh.

I went to Chicago, fell in love with deep dish and PRAYED to find something here. after searching and searching, I found this place and i saw the great reviews and was so excited!  I ordered the large cheese deep dish.  DISGUSTING! the crust is soft and bready. In chicago, the crust is crunchy and flaky. the sauce tasted like articial canned sauce. In chicago, the sauce tastes like they just mashed up some fresh tomatoes.  I could probably get frozen deep dish from wal mart that would taste better.

My favorite pizza ever.   it DOES live up to its hype! people are always complaining about the wait, the wait isn't even that long anymore. the longest I have waited since they started opening for lunch is 45 minutes. dont like it? Im sure there is a dominos near there where you can enjoy your cardboard pizza in 10 minutes. I have waited for 4 hours prior to them opening up for lunch and it was worth EVERY minute. O have had guests from Italy taste Biancos pizza and they loved it.   The margherita and Rosa are amazing.  The staff is great. For being as busy as they are, they are very helpful.  I highly recommend Pizzeria Biancos!  p.s. dont compare this place to Cibo, Cibo is great but its not Biancos, however, it is a great alternative choice.

My boyfriend and I decided on this place to celebrate our 3 year anniversary and we are pretty happy we did for the most part.   The parts I did not like (why they lost a star): Entrance is through the kitchen. I don't like that. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer a door in the front of the restaurant. Another thing, according to their yelp page, it says "dressy" for the dress code and it was anything but dressy. So there we are, him in a suit and me in a dress. I guess it is better to be over dressed than under dressed right? And last thing I didn't like was the way the restaurant itself was. I understand it is an old place, but they are long overdue for renovations. It's 2013 not 1960 anymore.   Onto the food... The bread with evoo and basil or whatever it is on it, it is soooooo good! I could not get enough of it. The vegetable platter they bring out with carrots, radishes, and onions is kind of weird. Who just eats onions dipped In ranch? It's very cheap of them. Anyways, My boyfriend ordered the NY steak and I got the prime steak done medium well. They came out and one bite and I was sold. The steaks were 5 star steaks. Mine was so tender and juicy. It was huge and filling. The side of garlic mashed potatoes was good too. Nothing special though. My boyfriend's steak was delicious too. It was perfectly done and so juicy. The steaks were definitely some of the best steaks we have ever had.   Service was good. Prices are high, but well worth it for the steaks.

Could this place be anymore fantastic!?   They have better coffee than any coffee bar I have been to..including *GASP*...STARBUCKS!!!   They have alcohal and food. Their drinks are made perfectly! I love being able to enjoy a drink while studying. Their food is great too! I LOVE their mac and cheese! its only $5 but tastes like a million bucks!   Im kinda obsessed with this place, i go here about 3 to 4 times a week.  p.s. they are the only place I been to besides an organic farmers market that carries KOMBUCHA with the seeds!.   long story, short: GO TO LUX!

I really wanted to like this place because I've heard nothing but positive things about it. Sadly, I didn't like it at all.   We went here on a Friday night with a couple of friends and I couldn't believe I had never seen this place. But it could be because it's kind of hidden.   The place is super nice. I loved the ambiance and crowd. The service was really good. Its a nice place to pre- drink before goin out. We ended up staying there til they closed. And that's where they earned two stars.  We got burgers because the friends we were out with recommened them and claimed that they were the best burgers in town...Basically all the burgers are the same with slight differences. They taste the same though. I wasn't impressed. Delux burger has better burgers.   The next morning was hell. My bf and I woke up with the same symptoms of sickness. Mind you, we each only had ONE drink that night so we werent hung over. Their food made us sick! We were both so sick that we couldn't move. It was awful.   But even with all that, I really want to like them so I will go back and give them another chance.

Again, I really really wanted to like this place but I just can't. The restaurant is beautiful, no doubt but the food... Ugh. The last time I came here I ordered a burger which made me sick; this time I got the chicken bonfire. The chicken was nothing special, the red potatoes tasted bland, and the "crunchy slaw" was flat out gross. I can't give it zero stars but I guess one star for the waffle fries. That's the best thing they have to offer. Boo!

I haven't been here in a while but I can't believe I forgot to review it.   This place is one of my favorite spots to get a burger. They're open till 2am everyday. Their burgers are so delicious and juicy. They also have my favorite beer Chimay, which not many restaurants carry.   The staff was nice the last time I went and before that but I don't know how they are now I'm sure they're great because the owner is a smart guy!   If you're willing to spend $12-15 on a good burger, then this is your spot!

I love finding new hipster spots and I and wasn't disappointed with this one!   Their decor is so beautiful!   We got the fez burger with garlic and rosemary fries, and it was out of this world delicious! Their fries are my new favorite. Their drink menu looks awesome but we saved to have them until next time we go.   The staff is great. We were warmly greeted by a guy at the front and our waiter was fast and efficient!   I love this place! It is a definite must try!

I love this place!  its so small but so cute at the same time. I think nearly everything is homemade which is great! their homemade strawberry jam is delicious!! They have the best pancakes! No syrup needed!  You MUSt get the hashbrowns!! everything tastes so fresh and flavorful. Its one of my favorite breakfast joints. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is because the staff is kind of ALL OVER THE PLACE which tends to get a little annoying. Other than that, no complaints! Go here and BON APETITE!

Such a cute little place!   We had their pho and it was delicious! Everything we saw other people get looked delicious as well and we can't wait to go back to try other things! (Total run on sentence, I know. lol)

Shortly after my first review, I was contacted by the customer service manager apologizing for my mediocre experience and wanted to make it right. I really appreciated that because it shows a lot on their part; they actually care about their customers! She offered me a generous gift certificate, unlike oreganos who sent me a $10 gift card which ended up insulting me even more.  So I went to LGO today with my parents for my "third times a charm" experience. We got there and the hostess said the wait would be about 15-20 minutes, but we were seated within like 5 minutes which was great considering how busy they were. Were seated and greeted by our waitress who was just amazing. She was just so sweet and polite. Needless to say, their customer service was outstanding! We ordered their lemonade because I love their lemonade. It is exactly how I think lemonade should be which is suuuper sour! We ordered this salad that came with beets, tomatoes, grapefruit and a poppy seed dressing. I don't remember what it was called. Also, we got the mother earth pizza and the roasted corn and added garlic to both. You just cant have pizza with no garlic!  The salad was delicious! just the perfect amount of zest and spice with mild goat cheese! yum! The pizza's were delightful! They were not overbearing with flavor but had enough to give your mouth a kick! I think we got the wrong pizza's last time because these ones were perfect! I loved the mother earth pizza more than the corn though.   After we stuffed our faces with that delicious food, I was ready for dessert. I got the red velvet cake that was paired with their coconut gelato. Of course that was my favorite part of the whole thing! Their red velvet cake was so moist and the icing was creamy and sweet! So yummy! as for the coconut gelato, it was PHENOMENAL! BEST gelato I have had. It tasted like actual coconuts and there was shredded coconut in there for a extra kick in the texture! Yummmm!  Anyway, So I am officially a fan of LGO! They went above and beyond to win me over and I am a permanent customer. Cant wait to go back! :)

This is one of my favorite mountains to hike. It can be a challenging, but it's so much fun. It can also get a bit crowded, but don't let that stop you. The view on top is worth it. There are tiny squirrels waiting for you to feed them at the top too. So cute. Be careful of rabies, other than that you've got a little rodent petting zoo.   There's easier trails than the main one too if you're looking for something that takes less time and not as steep.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  We went here for dinner with our friends and started out with the bruschetta and artichoke heart salad. We got the funghi, manchego(sp), and chorizo toppings. 2 out of three were great, we don't eat pork so we skipped the chorizo one. The salad was very good as well. I really loved the fluffy bread they serve with the pesto sauce! Yummy!  I got the sea-bass...it was the BEST sea-bass I've ever had. The orange peels and grapefruit all meshed so well together. It was just incredible! My bf had the salmon and it was grilled to perfection. It was tender and crispy and those baby beets they serve with it are to die for! And I don't even like beets! Out friends ordered the scallops and the mushroom tort-something and were very pleased with their selections.  Our waiter was super patient with us and gave excellent recommendations. I wish I could remember his name. He was just a great guy and seemed like he enjoyed his job. He definitely went above and beyond for us.  The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because I made reservations for 9:15 but weren't seated until about 9:40.

I remember I went to this movie years ago when it was just a regular theater. Then I went back about a year ago and saw the changes, it was awesome! They took the iPic concept which I love! We watched The Vow and reclined and got over prices mediocre tasting food. But I still loved it! So I wanted to have my boyfriend experience it as well since he liked iPic.  We went and got tickets for Safe Haven (I'm a total chick, I know) and I didn't care how expensive the tickets were because I knew what to expect for that price...my expectations were shot to tell! We sat in a theater where the chairs didn't recline and were uncomfortable. And it pissed me off even more that they had waiters in there because that's the reason they were over priced. If I'm gonna be in a regular theater, then I have no problem with standing in line at the concession stand. Needless to say, it was disappointing.   Do yourself a favor and go to iPic.

I just discovered this place and it JUST HAD TO be 2 minutes walking distance from my office! Now I'm going to go broke! It will be worth it.  I had the German chocolate cupcake, breakfast bun, oatmeal cookie, and banana bread (I'm fat on the inside, yes). I loved all of it except the banana bread. It was a bit soggy and doughy. But everything was AMAZING. Especially the cookie!  If you have a sweet tooth, I defintely recommend this place.  Enjoy your clogged arteries.

I wish these were on every corner like Starbucks! This place pretty much takes the cake over Starbucks! Their coffee isn't overwhelming and they have my favorite drink everrrrrrr  which is the Iced tropical tea latte! It's absolutely delicious!! Yum! I urge everyone to try that drink!

I have been here a few times and every time I have picked up, everyone including the owner has been super nice and friendly. When they deliver, the delivery person has been nice and not creepy.   I am a total pizza snob, and while this place doesn't have the best pizza, they do have decent pizza. I don't mind eating it. What i do love here is their freakin' wings!! Their mild extra saucy well-done wings are crispy and flavorful. My mouth is watering as I write this. They hands down have the best wings I have tried from anywhere else and I happen to be a wing junkie as well.  If you are on the west side, I would definitely recommend this place!

Meh. This place was not that great. The sushi wasn't fresh and it was rolled sloppily. I know how to use chopsticks for the most part, but everything just fell apart. My best friend isn't picky about food especially sushi, but even she said it was gross.   The best part about this restaurant is their happy hour. It's sake galore. The service was good too.  If I go back, it will be strictly for sake.

This place has the best coffee ever!! It's a little pricey for the large drinks but the regular size is bigger than a venti at Starbucks.  My friends got the Carmel vanilla blended drink, my other friend got the regular iced coffee and I got the triple chocolate mocha. All three drinks were so delicious! The favorite ended up being the Carmel vanilla.  This is our new spot on the west side.

Im always looking for those trendy urban type places, So glad we finally tried this place! We came here with a couple of our friends and the inside is no neatly decorated and has a really fun and friendly ambiance.   We got to talking about took us forever to look at the menu but our waitress was very patient with us. When we finally looked at the menu, the menu was short which I always take as a good sign. I love short menus.  I got the "forbidden rice bowl", my bf and friend got the "chicken salad sandwich" and my friends husband got the " pork chilli verde". My rice was delicious! There were 7 different types of veggies in there and it was cooked to perfection; not too hard, not too soft, just the right amount on crisp. I didn't really like the rice. It was too strong for my liking. The chicken salad sandwich was amazing! Just the right amount of spices to cover up that chickeny flavor! And my friends husband loved his pork chilli verde.   This place is the place for health nuts, vegans, vegeterians, etc!   I can't wait to try their drinks! They sounded so good! We will be back soon!

My friend and I went here looking for a kitten and there were only adult cats. We didn't find what we were looking for which is fine, it happens. I went into the "turn in" center to ask if they take in stray cats. As I was about to walk out, I saw a guy with a cage full of small kitties. I proceeded to ask the man if he was adopting them and where he got them from, when one of their idiot volunteers shouts across the room telling me I can't speak with someone turning in animals. I gave him my death stare and told him I didn't know their rules and he was like "yea, you can't talk to them" still shouting from across the room in front of everyone! I got mad and walked out.  I already disliked AHS before this incident and this makes me dislike them even more. I feel sorry for the animals that belong to a crappy organization like them. My donations are not going to your awful organization.   I strongly discourage people not to donate money to them!

My friend brought me here for a "late bday" dinner and it's got the "FEZ" environment.   We were seated and our waiter who was supper nice came and informed us of their appetizers of the day.   We ended up getting the empanadas for our appetizer and my friend got the bleu burger and I got their Mac and cheese.   The empanadas were delicious. They tasted like they had meat in them but were vegetarian. So good! And the balsamic dressing gave it a nice kick.   My friend liked her burger but complained it was too messy and it fell apart easily.  The Mac and cheese was delish! It was so cheesy and perfect! I loved t!

I have been going here for about 2 years. started out at the old small place and now the big place. I have ALWAYS loved eating here. I was SUUUPER excited to take my bf here and so we went and here goes...  we were seated for about 20 minutes before someone got our order.   we both ordered the sirloin tips that came with hash browns, eggs and pancakes..ALL FOR $10!!! cheap!! and We both got coffee....well, the water had more flavor than the coffee. It was not dark AT all.    Our food came out, it was good as usual, but our pancakes didnt show up. No one checked to see if everything was ok or if our order was complete. finally after hunting down our incompetent (sp) waiter, we told him we didnt get our pancakes, so he went and apparently they had been sitting out and they just "forgot" to bring them. SO YOUR FORGETFULNESS caused my pancake to get cold! And we usually get 2 panckes and they ONLY gave us one. Our waiter disappeared again, and we had to wait for like half an hour after we were done eating to receive our bill, and then finally some waitress noticed we had been waiting and got our bill for us. THEN we had to wait another 10 minutes to get our bill picked up.   This is one of the worst restaurant experiences we have ever had. And it is SUCH a shame because I actually liked your food but NOT enough to return with that kind of lousiness you have going on.   Oh and FYI, you may want to change the dress code of your staff. When I eat i dont want to see my waiter/waitress in cut off sleevless shirts showing me their sweaty/hairy armpits.

Okay In-N-Out, can you just stop being so perfect? I can't take it!  If it's not good enough that your burgers and fries are delicious, but you cater to us vegetarians too!? Come on!   As I sat there being a sad vegetarian eating my fries, my vegetarian friend comes with her animal style "burger." I took a bite and of course it tasted like heaven...to my surprise..THERE WAS A NO MEAT!! It was buns and all the animal style stuff they put on it! And it still tasted incredibly delicious!   I love you, In-N- Out. That is all.

My sister is here from NY and she's on a Mexican food hunt. We went here and ordered a bistec burrito, king beef tacos, and a chicken quesadilla, and horchata.   The food was delicious! It was so authentic and flavorful! The flavors of the grilled opinion and jalepenos meshed so well together for a tasty kick in the mouth! I'm super picky about guacamole and I loved theres. It was creamy with the right amount of flavor. The horchata was ok, it was a little too ricey for my liking, but I liked that it wasn't super sweet.  My sister was very happy! I can't wait to try their tortas! The food was definitely 5 stars for Mexican food.  The prices were great! We got all that for about $30.00.  The only reason they lost a star from me is because the girls up front are lacking personalities. They are very pretty but very unprofessional.

Their pizza was so much better this time around. I think I may have ordered the wrong pizza last time! We ordered the Mediterranean pizza with feta on the side and it was delicious! It was so greasy and good but not soggy. We also got the mozzarella chicken lasagna, which looked amazing but tasted just eh. But as other dishes were passing by, they looked so good. I will definitely go back. I really enjoy this place!

Three hungry girls sick of eating the same old crap, we decided to check this place out since we were nearby. All three of us lived in turkey at one point in our lives so we have all had good Turkish food. Anyway, we got the yogurt drink which was delicious. Two of us got the beef doner plate and one got the chicken doner plate. I think we got the left over scraps because we went late so chicken was dry and the beef was greasy. The salad had a spicy dressing which didnt mesh well. The hummus had little flavor. We expected better pita, but they used the usual arabic pita. I hate that pita. i was hungry but I could finish my plate, it just wasn't good.   The older gentleman who served us (I think he was the owner) was very polite and personable. I just wish I could have liked his restaurant.

I guess if you are not near a closer local coffee shop, this place is ok. It beats Starbucks, but that's about it. I actually really wanted to like this place since they are always on top of the "best coffee shops" list.   The menu is simple...too simple. There is no variety. I am usually ok with a latte or regular coffee, but not everyone is like me. My friend ordered the cappuccino, but the guy taking an order informed her that they didn't have that available to go, so if she wanted it, then she would have to stay there....uhhh why can't I have a cappuccino to go?...stupid. we got a little drink for $3.50....a little..I mean like 6oz. Yeah, definitely not worth it.   The place is big and loud and uncomfortable. They are trying too hard.  This place is definitely OVERRATED.

The first time I tried a place like this was in san diego and I fell in love!   I love this place because you basically pick your own ingredients. The only downfall could be that you suck at picking ingredients and your food sucks. While you can complain at other places, here you can't blame anyone but yourself! Im sure the servers are happy about that!   they have soooooo much variety! from chicken to scallops, to calamari, etc! and all sorts of spices and veggies and sauces! i feel like a little kid in here!   so you get to pick your veggies, meats, sauces, spices, and at the cook bar they ask you what starches you want. I like noodles! and they cook it for you and bring it to you. Mine always ends up tasting amazing! I go all GENGHIS KHAN ON MY FOOD! haha..anyway, All the flavors are a kick in the mouth...in a good way!...(is there a good way to get kicked in the mouth?!)..you get my point!   the servers are super nice, and the place is super cheap!  They have awesome drink specials too! monday-Thursday, all day happy hour!

my friends and I went here for the first time last night and we were VERY happy! Their happy hour menu is fantastic! we got the philly roll, crazy boy, spicy tuna tempura, and shrimp tempura. They were all really delicious and had sooo much flavor. This place blew RA out of the water.  the location is eh, but the sushi is FAB!   the staff was really nice. I asked for extra ginger and boy, they weren't stingy at all! Oh and their prices are great!  Thank goodness we found this place because I'm a fan and will be back. NO MORE KOI for meeeeee :) YAYERRR!!!

There's a bit of history with me and this place. Many moons ago, my family was super close to the former owners of this place when it was called Romans pizza. Then my brother and his best friend bought it from them and ran it...to the ground. And that's probably the best thing that ever happened to this place because luckily after that, Pizza A Metro happened.   I always passed by this place but I never bothered to stop because the area really creeps me out. Well, after seeing a bunch of my yelp friends check in to here and reading the reviews, I finally decided it was time.   This place is a poster child for "don't judge a book by it's cover" because that's what I did and I missed out. When I walked in, it's tiny. But it gives you a warm feeling. I don't know what it is about it. I got the to-go menu and they had their lunch menu which was incredibly cheap!   I ordered the small margherita pizza. I asked the girl how small is the small and she told me 12 inches...here I am thinking 8 inches. And it was only $7.95! What a deal! I was stuck between the tirimisu and the creme brûlée. I love both desserts and I love homemade tirimisu even more but the creme brûlée won. I had my dessert before my pizza since I had to wait til it was cooked. The creme brûlée was excellent! It was perfectly creamy and the perfect amount of vanilla flavor. My pizza was ready and I took it with me...I don't usually like to eat in my car but I DEVOURED this pizza before I even made it to school. It wasn't overly salty, had the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. I wish it had more basil but it didn't ruin it. Overall, I was satisfied!   I will definitely be back to try the pastas and the tirimisu!

Where has this place been all of my life!?   We were seated right away and greeted by our server. When given the menus, everything seemed so good! My friend wanted a salad and the server recommended the Mediterranean chicken salad. And I ended up getting the gyro with a side of garlic potatoes. As for drinks, we got their delicious tropical tea.  Our food arrived and the salad looked AMAZING!!! It was huge! And my gyro looked small but it was delicious and filling. I'm not a big fan of gyros because they tend to be so greasy which always makes me feel sick after eating it and then come the regrets, but this time it was perfect. No grease or mess and even though I finished everything, I was satisfied not sick. Along with finishing MY food I finished my friends salad. HOLY CRAP! That was the best salad I have ever had in my life and I am not even that big of a fan of salads.   The second time we went, the service wasn't as good as the first time.

A while ago my friends and I stopped by here for the very first time and I can't recall what we ordered but it was a thin crust pizza. The crust was crispy but not hard to where it tasted like cardboard. The ingredients tasted fresh and the pizza itself had tons of flavor! I loved it!   A week later, another girlfriend of mine and I wanted to go somewhere to eat. Me being a pizza freak, I suggested pizza as told her that she had to try this place.  We got there and were seated. As I am sitting I look down at my empty plate and THERE WAS A FREAKING DEAD CRICKET ON IT!!! I was astonished! So we get up to leave; On our way out, we told someone and they said they'd seat us elsewhere! Uhhhh no thank you, you can eat your own insect pizza!  No apology, no nothing!!

The place is nice. Service was ok. The waiter poured too much water where it splashed on the table and just said "oops"...  We got their deep dish pizza whth roasted garlic and fresh basil; Their definition of deep dish is thick crust, so that was disappointing. Their pizza sauce tasted like rotten tomatoes. yucky. I got the tomato bisque and I've had better tomato bisque in a student cafeteria. We also got their sample appetizer platter and I only liked their avocado rolls and their mozzerella sticks. The rest was just gross.   I don't recommend this place at all. Only reason they got 2 stars instead of one is because I liked the way the place looked.

This place is so yummy. They have this raw veggies appetizer and it's nothing like I'd ever seen before. When i say raw, I mean it seems like they have a garden in the back and they just picked them.   Their edamame and dumplings are so good. They are flavorful! I wish the portion was bigger. I always get their squash casserole and it's one of the best tasting foods I have ever had. I find myself craving it at random times very frequently.   I love eating here because you can taste the fresh quality in every bite of the food but also because you don't feel like you're gonna have a heart attack after you eat.

After our RnR visit was a fail, we settled for Daily Dose and I am glad we did! My study group and I were going to have study session Sunday, but in order to get our thinking caps on, we needed food first.  We were seated at a high top table and greeted by our waitress promptly. We ordered two bloody Mary's and a lame-o ordered a diet coke. I chose the Bloody Mary with cucumber vodka upon the servers recommendation. Boy, did she screw me over...it wasn't good. Actually, even the regular one wasn't good. So..I got a michelada! YAS! which was so much better!  Food time! As our appetizer, we ordered the chicken nachos...BEST NACHOS EVER!!! so many ingredients, and cheese ( I LOVE cheese!), and this cheese sauce that was a little spicy but so good! mmmmm!  I got the turkey sausage omelet and added mushrooms to it. It came with a side of seasons potatoes and your choice of butternut squash hash, cottage cheese, or fruit. Well I asked for the servers recommendation (I am extremely indecisive), and she said the butternut squash was good. Once again, she screwed me over because I hated it. Everything else was excellent! The potatoes had the perfect amount of seasoning and were cooked to a crisp. The omelet was exploding with flavor.  I don't remember what my friends got but they were pretty happy with their choices. We were all in food coma shortly after. Our plates were not even half eaten before we stopped eating because it was THAT much food. As much as we hated to stop eating, we had to or else the rest of the day would have been bad.  The prices are really good here! So much food for like $10.00! Cant beat that!  Service was good, I just wish my server had better taste in food.  I will be coming back fa sho!

This location is a lot nicer than the arrowhead one, decor and demographics wise.   Some of their plates are also bigger and you get more of what you are paying for. I saw the garlic potatoes and they looked so much better than the ones at the arrowhead location. The salads were the same but I think we may make this our primary location.   One tiny complaint: too much raisins in the Mediterranean chicken salad at this place.

After the crappy experience at MIMI's  cafe, we yelped breakfast spots and BINGO! we found this place. It was close by so it was a plus! We got there and its freaking awesome. Their order style is like Pei Wei, you dont have to deal wtih servers and stuff, but the staff is awesome. They were super nice and attentive! Their food was delicious! we got the french toast and the steak and eggs. It was so filling but not to the point to where you wanna throw up. the location sucks, but with how great this place is, who cares! We found our new breakfast spot! No more iHop, Dennys, etc!

I cannot believe it has taken me this long write a review since I have been coming to this spot since 2010.   I don't even know where to start...But I will start with the Bruschetta. I have tried all the different types of bruschetta except the ones with pork. The white bean hummus one is by far my favorite. The Panini's are phenomenal! I, again, have tried all except the ones with pork and the chicken and mozzarella is my favorite, although they're all super delicious! It comes with a side salad or homemade potato chips, and you can't really go wrong with either choice.  I recently tried their broccoli and cheddar soup, which was the soup of the day and it is the best I have had.   Now onto the good stuff...VINO, WINE, Heaven in a long stem glass, etc...They have so many selections to pick from and the waiters/waitresses have ben pretty good about their recommendations. They haven't steered me wrong yet. My favorite so far has been the pink rosé.   I seriously love love LOVE this place. Every time I have been here, I have never waited more than 30 minutes and the services has always been friendly and fast. The prices are not bad and the ambiance is very nice.

The first time i came here, everything was on point!! I got their delicious chips and salsa along with 2 shrimp tacos, 2 fish tacos, and 2 carve Asada tacos. All sooo good. My boyfriend thought the carne Asada tacos tasted like cat food, but I liked them! I also got their Bloody Mary and its one of the best I've had!   I went back here last night for their awesome all day Tuesday happy hour with my BFF and we got the corn on the cob thing with paprika which was recommended to us by our super awesome waitress and I got 2 fish tacos and a carne Asada taco. My friend got 2 carne Asada tacos and a shrimp taco. We also got their guacamole which was delicious! and we can't forget about those Bloody Mary's! I thought the carne Asada tacos tasted better this time around while she thought the meat was over cooked and preferred her first time there better.   The reason they lost a star from me is because if their inconsistency of their food. I guess I always go back to a place thinking what I get this time will taste exactly like last time. And also their drinks aren't strong at all. My friend and I are both light weights and we didn't feel a think after 2 bloody Mary's. usually after 2 drinks, were flying!   Overall, I do love this place!

Obsessed with Dutch Bros. I cannot pass by one without stopping. This time I stopped at this location and got the iced annihilator and I LOVED it. It is so creamy and smooth. It is delicious! I liked it better than the carmelizer.   The employees at this one are super cute and friendly too! Such well mannered children!

Our Thai food craze continues...We were searching for a place close to Lux and saw this place. It's in this shady little strip mall thing, if it even can be classified as a strip mall. I'll just call it that for now. Anyway, we walked in here and the place was cute. It had an old feel to it. It was pretty empty. There was one other Person in there besides us.   I got something with beef. As I usually do. I love me some cow. And my friend got the sweet and sour chicken, of course. Everything was super tasty and delicious. Service was good. And prices were good. We left satisfied.

the first time i went to babbos was the one on 67th and the 101, and my experience was ok, not the best. But tonight, we went to the one on 16th street and it was absolutely OUTSTANDING!!! There were sooooo many choices of pasta that it became difficult to choose! You're gonna want to try them ALL. Anyway, the pastas we got were incredible, but im sure they are all delicious! and that bread and oil and vinegar they bring out is AMAZING. that was my favorite. Overall, food was wonderful.  Service, you ask. THE BEST! our waitress, Jessica was amazing. She was a delight! She was on point, checking up on us frequently, keeping up with refills, and even getting personal with us. She is SO sweet. We LOVED her. She definitely made our experience better. So if the manager is reading this, GIVE HER A RAISE!!! ;) we will defintely be requesting her.   Want italian and great service? This location babbos is your spot!

I really liked this place! It was empty when we went it, but most Thai places are around 8:00 pm. The server was really nice and gave good service. We got the spicy basil dish and the sweet and sour chicken. The spicy basil was amazing!!! You could actually taste the basil! It was delicious! On the downside, we got it at "medium" spicy level and it was just way too spicy. The sweet and sour chicken was ok. It could have been better. It wasn't very sweet, it was more sour. So I got a side of the sweet sauce and that made it better.   This place is close by asu so that's a plus too. We will definitely be back!

I got into my car at ASU west to leave only to discover that I had a flat tire. Grrrreeeaaatttt!!! Me being a girl, of course I don't know how to change a flat. Heck, I only recently discovered what a spare was! I checked for my spare only to find that I didn't have the right tools to change it myself...I was gonna youtube it :/   I called my roadside assistance and they told me that the driver would be there anytime  between now and 60 minutes. Based on my previous experiences with tow truck companies, that usually means 2 hours. I was fine with it since I was in a safe spot with a friend. To my surprise, 40 minutes later, I get a call from Darrell, the driver. He was super nice and friendly. He checked my tire and told me that he could change it if I'd like. Heck yes! So he went to get my spare and guess what he found? All the tools to change a flat right there in my trunk! I'm such a girl! After he changed my tire, he checked all my tires and being they were all low on air, he filled them and I was on my way in no time!! Super super amazing service! Thanks QP and Darrell for saving the night!   I definitely recommend QP if you need roadside assistance!!

After Vito was such a dissapointment, my search for deep dish continued....AND yesterday, I found this place! I DONT HAVE TO SEARCH ANYMORE!!  I got their small 8" deep dish with extra sauce, extra cheese, and garlic...and when I went and picked it up, it smelled like heaven in my car! I was so ecstatic to try it but was praying for it to be semi-good....But... IT WAS FREAKING DELICIOUS!!!! it tasted IDENTICAL to the deep dish in Chicago! I literally was having a "FOODGASM". Im getting all giddy just thinking about it!  I paid nearly $16 for a personal deep dish, but it was worth it. The location is eh and theres no seating. So its either pick up or delivery.   CHICAGO PIZZA IN ARIZONA!?  whowouldathunkit?

This place was extremely disappointing!   After having some amazing fish tacos in SD, I wanted to find something here that would hold me over until my next trip.  After reading the reviews for this place, I was sure this was going to be my spot. Oh how wrong I was!   I got the shark and mahi mahi taco special with horchata. My friends got the white fish taco plate with that nasty ass red drink.   Everything tasted so awful. I didn't even finish one of my tacos because I was so disgusted by it. My friends finished theirs but that's just because they were hungry. Afterwards, we all got sick from the food.   Yuck, even thinking about it makes me want to vomit.

I'm obsessed with Thai food. I'm very close to moving Thailand so I can bathe in Thai food. The first time I came here, the food was good but I was in bad company so I didn't enjoy it.   2nd visit. My friend and I came here and i got the sweet basil entree with beef and my friend got the sweet and sour chicken. Everything was delicious!! The sweet and sour chicken was perfectly breaded and sauced and the basil beef was the right amount of spicy and basily. My taste buds were definitely happy!

I come here because it's the closest spot to my house. The staff is awful, but the men who work there are much easier to deal with than the women. ANY TIME I have dealt with a female, I've walked out without finishing what I came to do. They are so unhelpful and RUDE!   I walked in to pay a bill and only had $100.00 bill on me. Th lady who greeted me tried to send me to the kiosks and I told her, no I want to talk to a HUMAN. Then she said "I don't have change, but you can go to chili's and get change" at that point she was lucky I didn't slap her. Basically she was tellin me NO ONE paid with cash that day? I call bullshit. Had she been nicer I wouldn't be yelping my horrible experience but she got all snarky the minute I didn't want to use to kiosks. I guess doing a job you get paid to is too hard to manage. I didn't get her name but I will be getting it!  You would think that since Verizon is the most expensive service, they would have better representatives, but they have like the worst customer service which is just not worth renewing my contract for.

I had high hopes for this place based on the reviews, but it failed me. I can't say the same for my coworkers though, because they liked it. For me, the gyro sandwich was extremely plain. There was only tomato and onion with taziki sauce. I gave them another shot but it was the same thing with a whole container of taziki slathered on it. Traditionally, there is more stuff that comes on a gyro sandwich. The food sat heavy and the toilet was my best friend after eating here.

I have been passing this place for the last 2.5 years as it is literally across the street from my work. A little jaywalking, and BOOM! You are there.   It was a gloomy semi-rainy day, so it was a perfect day for soup. My coworkers and I agreed to try this place and were excited that it was kosher (not that it made a difference, but we wanted to try something new) and that they served Chinese, Japanese, American, and Jewish in one place.  Two of got the Matzah Ball chicken soup, One got the wonton soup, and another one got the spicy chicken sandwich.   20 minutes later, I walked over to pick it up. The restaurant has a section that is "bakery" and butcher shop, and a grocery store for kosher items. The restaurant area is decent, nothing special. There was about 3 tables occupied, maybe 4 people total dining. I asked the waitress to split the bill by item since all 4 things were for 4 different people. She looked stressed. She was running around like a headless chicken serving FOUR people. Jeez, get it together. To be fair, it was her 3rd day. She asked some guy to help her split the check, he came over aaaanddd taaaaalllkkkeeddd liiiikkkeee thiiiiisssss (come on, spit it out!!) who seemed annoyed. What seemed like a 5 hour transaction was FINALLY done!   Food time! My Matzah ball soup was overwhelmingly underwhelming. It was bland, salty, and overpriced. One of my coworkers said her wonton soup was just "eh" and the other one said what I said and the one who ordered the $13 chicken sandwich said that he tasted lots of char. Super disappointing for the hassle I went through.  Overall, everyone who worked here was slow and unprofessional even the owner. The food is extremely overpriced and bland. I will not be going back and I recommend you don't either. SAVE THYSELF!

$5 medium pizzas? Yes please!! Their pizza was very delicious for the price! It had lots of oregano on it which was awesome! I loved it! They also have a lunch special that consists of 2 slices and a soda for $3! Crazy!

I wish I came to this place with more of an appetite. But I didn't so I got a salad. I got the fattoush salad. It was delicious! The only thing I didn't like about it was all the thick pita bread chunks in it. It would have been better had they put in thin crispy pita chips. Anyway, I know them and postinos are affiliated with each other so I didn't expect anything bad about this place which I didn't get. The service was good. The restaurant is nice. The wait sucks but I think it's worth it.

This place is awesome!!! A little expensive but it's once a year so it's worth it. The line was long but it moved quickly so I don't know what everyone is complaining about. We went on Halloween so you could imagine his busy it was. Plus the line was actually fun because they have a few monsters and clowns walking around  for entertainment. The haunted house itself was perfectly scary. The set up was great, it actually felt like we were going the 13th floor. We loved it! Zombie land is the second attraction which is just eh. I'm not into this whole zombie craze everyone's into so I didn't care much for it.   This place is definitely better than fear farm.   I'd definitely go back!

This place is pretty decent. I wish I knew more about Indian food or culture to really enjoy it. But I don't, whatever.   Their naan is AMAZING. It's so flaky and buttery! My favorite of course. Their chicken tikki masala is on point. It has lots of flavor and is the perfect amount of spicy. So was their tandoor chicken tikki masala.   Their rice lacked flavor but it wasn't too bad with the other stuff.   I got this stew thing, which was pretty good but I'm not a big fan of lamb so if I had to get it again, I'd get beef instead.   We'll probably be back.

I love this place and their selections! They always have red velvet unlike the places that switch out their flavors (ahem, ahem MoJo, yogurtology, etc)!!!!! their newest featured flavors are the bananalicious and hawaiin something and their BOTH delish!  The ONLY reason they didnt get 5 stars from me is because......THEY DONT FREAKING HAVE JUICE POPPERS!!!! how do you not have juice poppers!?  EVERYONE LOVES JUICE POPPERS!!!

Laura is so fabulous and so worth the drive all the way to Scottsdale! She's so corky and makes you feel welcome and comfortable. She uses vegan wax and rose and jasmine after wax products so this place is perfect for vegans and vegetarians.  She was on time for my appointment and extremely friendly! She's so cute. Laura told me exactly what she was gonna do to my eyebrows to make them look normal again. She did exactly what I wanted. My eyebrows still have work but they look so much better after my horrific experience with the lady I used to go to.   I love my brows and I will definitely be back to see Laura!

My favorite Mediterranean restaurant BY FAR!  not ONLY is the food excellent, but the service is absolutely oustanding. Everyone is so personable and friendly. They make you feel so welcome! Amera, is excellent. She is so wonderful to interract with! And always reassures me on my order.   I am a huge lover of hummus and very picky about it, and they have the best hummus I've had. Their beef shawerma is so juicy and tender. I also usually dont like lamb, but theirs is so good! WAY TO GO ALI BABA for making like lamb! i cant wait to try the ENTIRE menu. Yummy!  ALSO, the place is so clean!! BIG PLUS!!   I'd recommend this place to anyone! Go here for 5 star quality food!

I was in desperate need of getting my eyebrows down (they had not been waxed in 2 months, so you can imagine what they looked like. EW!) but i had no idea where to get them done. i have been unsatisfied with every place so far. I decided to give this place a chance. So I called this place up at 4:20 and they told me they close at 5 and would be able to get me in at 4:30. luckily, i was just down the street so i took the appointment.   When I got there, I noticed how clean the place was! That calmed my nerves. The girl at the front was very sweet! She told me since it was my first time, my wax would be complimentary! Awesome right!? Then my aesthetician, Sharon came out and took me to the room, which was super clean and explained the 4 step process. She engaged in convo, making me feel at ease. She was fantastic!   And now for the results... I LOVE MY EYEBROWS!! They look the same and are perfectly shaped, not overly thick or thin! She did such an amazing job!!   I am SO GLAD I came here! I have my next appointment in 3 weeks ;)   P.S. they give you $5 vouchers left and right, so you're always getting a deal!

Wellll had I known this place existed, I might have become a vegetarian sooner!   We went here for "late bday dinner" for the first time. We probably looked completely out of place (probably because we didn't look like unshowered hipsters..jk!)   Anyway, I got the Singapore soy, which was zesty and delicious! I loved the crispy tofu! My friends got the big WAC burgers and the Mongolian bowl. They were both extremely satisfied with their choices.   We will definitely come back! Oh and their vimto drink is amaze balls!

We discovered that place by total accident because I would most likely never go to a restaurant in sunny slope unless it really was amazing. We drove past it on our way to our actual destination but the wait was too long so we drove back to timo.  As a starter, We got their wings and they were really good. They were really fancy shmancy, which I don't prefer. I like going caveman on my sloppy wings. Then for our meals we got the margherita pizza and Mediterranean thin crust pizza half with chicken on it. We always determine if a place is good by their cheese or margherita pizza. This place had a delicious margherita pizza! They had lots of fresh basil on it. The Mediterranean pizza was good. It was super crispy and flavorful. I don't like chicken so I didn't try the other half but my bf liked it. And it was a major plus because most of the food is wood fired!   Service was good and ambiance was reaaallyy nice. We will definitely be back.

I went here for the first time and it was pretty crowded, which i usually take as a good sign. We were seated right away. The place is not that big so the tables are pretty close to one another so if you like your own space, then maybe you ought to try elsewhere.   We started out with the Caprese (sp) and it was AMAZING! their pesto sauce has so much flavor and i LOOOOVED their cheese!! Then we got some wings and their wings ar so meaty and delicious. Im not a big fan of chicken and i usually like mt wings burnt to the bone so i dont taste the flavor (weird, i know) but their wings were pretty great. AND that freaking hot sauce they have is not really hot BUT IT IS BY THE FAR THE MOST DELICIOUS sauce i have had...EVER! I'd go back just for that if everything else sucked.   Then, my boyfriend got the shrimp pizza (shrimp on pizza!?) and I got the chicken pesto. I didnt like either of them. shrimp is just not meant to go on pizza. it doesnt mesh well and their was a sweet kick to it, which my taste buds were just not feeling. The chicken peso was TOO chickeny! it had wayyyyyyyy too much chicken. but the crisped onions on top were delish!   Our waiter, i wish i could remember his name, but he was an older gentleman with glasses and he was so great! I will be requesting him every time i go there again.   Overall, I was very happy with this place. I'll just have to try different pizza's next time

This place is fantastic! I loved my pedicure! Pamela was gentle with my feet and didn't try to up sell me like the other places I go to. She made a cute little pink flower design which I loved.   As for my gel manicure, I also loved that! I couldn't decide on what color but I went with hot pink...you know..cuz I wanted summa time nails! I didn't catch the girls name but she was also very gentle and friendly. I think she was amazed at my nails because my nails are naturally healthy and fabulous. Anyway, she didn't rush me, took her time, and did great.   I think the girls may need to practice shaping stiletto nails better. That's the only semi problem I can think of. But it's no big deal.   Also, they don't take tips on debit and credit, so don't forget to take cash!   The place is cool. It's clean and has a nice vibe to it. The prices are reasonable.   Overall, I really liked this spot and I am totally going back!

I heard so many great things about this place! So when Joycie said she was going to have her birthday here, I was ecstatic!   Apparently they don't take reservations on Saturday so most of her party got there around 6:40 so we could get a table by 7. Well that didn't happen. We were seated around 8 at TWO different tables because they said they couldn't put two tables together because of some lame excuse. At this point, we just wanted to eat.   Onto the food! I got the margherita pizza. I didn't like it. The pizza tasted like feet. The only reason I even ate as much as I did was because I was starving. However, everyone else seemed to enjoy their food.   Service was eh. Could have been better. The prices are pretty good.   I was expecting so much more from here since I love the upward project restaurants.

My coworkers had been raving about this place, so I was excited try it, especially after they said it was a "chipotle" style place.  So we get there and i just found everything to be so disorganized. Theres all sorts of stuff sitting there and they expect you to know how it all works. Anyway, I don't know even how to describe the process and the food. It was just flat out not good. It was too sour and just didn't do it for me.   Maybe I didn't order the right thing. I do plan on giving it another chance because i saw them put all that stuffing into a green chili and I wanted to try it.  I am hoping it will be better the second time around.  I still love chipotle. Much better.

I was just as disappointed the second time around if not more. Everything is just so overly sour but not flavored.  It sits supers heavy and you end up smelling like onions and shit all day.  Thanks, but no thanks.

This place is awful! I'm pretty sure the whole "discounted" term they use is a gimmick to fool people into thinking they're paying less!   I went into Michael kors looking for a watch and was told it was $350...that's how much they are at the store inside fashion square and they're only $275 at Dillard's. so don't tell me it's a "discounted" place.   Charlotte Russe has their shoes for buy one get one for $12.50...at the non outlet store it's buy one get one for $15.50.   The H&M has the same prices as the one in Scottsdale.   I've never liked outlet malls, but this one takes the cake for being the worst.

Believe the hype! I drove by this place and there was a ridiculous line of cars and also a long line leading up to the pick up window. I've been to Dutch bros before but not this location. Anyway, there's not much to say that already hasn't been said. Employees are fantastic! I haven't seen teenagers this cool since I was a teenager looking in the mirror! The service is super fast. So yes, the line is long but you'll be on your way before you know. The coffee is amazing. Way better than Dunkin and Starbucks. I got the Carmelizer and I think I may have a heart attack now, but it's worth it. It was so amazing I really believe it was made from pure unicorn blood. That's the only legit explanation I can find for the deliciousness of it. Now if only we could get one on every corner then life would be complete.  Oh and I almost forgot to mention that I bought a large drink and got a card that was stamped 9 times already! Awesome!

The one thing I regretted about my Chicago trip was not going to Portillos, so I was super happy when I heard they were opening one here!  I guess it's not so bad after all that our state is infested with people from Illinois, they bring good food to make up for their awful driving...  We got their Italian beef drenched in their sauce, it was AMAZING!! So juicy and messy! We also got their all beef hot dog with no mustard or relish and it was delicious!! I despise hot dogs and I loved their hot dog. I liked it better than the Italian beef. Their fries were perfectly salted and yummy! We meant to get their charbroiled chicken sandwich but got the fried one and it was ok.   They don't have a fountain drink station in their sit down area which sucks but oh well, don't fill yourself up with soda anyway so you can enjoy the food!   I had super high expectations for this place and they were met! I can't wait to go back there ASAP! They are so worth the cardiac arrest!

Checked out the new location which is much nicer and roomier than the old one. I loved everything again and their homemade jams from scratch is the most amazing thing ever!   Initially I gave them 5 stars but I decided on 4 this time because almost their entire menu has nothing but pork! Come on, not everyone eats pork! :(

After going months without doing my eyebrows to allow them to grow back, I finally decided it was time. I walked in here looking like a caveman and after the lady was done threading my eyebrows, I walked out looking like a woman!   I've had my eyebrows threaded and I hated it because it was so painful. Surprisingly, this lady didn't hurt me. After she was done, I looked in the mirror and she noticed that they weren't even and fixed them. NO ONE has ever actually acknowledged their mistakes at any other salon I have went to.   $8 for eyebrows. So cheap and so worth it and much more. My eyebrows look beautiful and I got my middle eastern look back! I will be returning!

This one is disappointing to write because I wanted to love this place like everyone else does. We got here around 10:45 in the morning and it wasn't crowded. We were seated promptly and our waitress came over for drink orders. She was pleasant. 4 of us decided on the Bloody Mary's. For my brunch I got the corned beef hash meal since everything else has pork in it. Once we got our glasses with vodka, we had to go to the "Bloody Mary bar."....the bar had the Bloody Mary mix, olives, sausage sticks, bacon, horseradish, salt and pepper, and a bunch of different sauces...what do you think is missing?...HOW ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE?! I don't eat pork so bacon and sausage was out for me. I didn't have that many options. When We asked for pickles and pickle juice (pickle juice is one the main ingredients for a Bloody Mary), the extremely rude and snarky bartender replied with "whatever is there is all we have." We let her bitchy response go and went back to our seats.  The last time I went to a place that had a Bloody Mary bar, there were so many options that you could make a meal of it. Let's not false advertise, Vig.  When we got back, our food arrived and looked amazing...and then the guy who brought the food out had one extra plate of food...we told him it wasn't ours...and he started telling us what it was...WE KNOW WHAT IT WAS...IT WASNT OURS! There were 5 of us and he brought a 6th plate out and tried to make US seem like idiots when he was the real idiot.   My plate was OK. It lacked the flavor I expected and the poached eggs tasted like chunks of water. There was giant chunks of pure fat corned beef. I would rate it a 4 on scale or 1 to 10. The Bloody Mary tasted like tomato paste...awful. We asked our waitress for pickles and pickle juice...and they DID have it. That ended up making the bloody Mary's tolerable.   I was extremely unsatisfied and disappointed here. Needless to say, I will not be back or recommend this place. I MIGHT give the other location a try once I'm over what happened here.

Meh. I wasn't impressed with this place. Their flavors didn't taste like what they were supposed to and I didn't like the texture much either. The flavors were kind of boring and they weren't appealing either.   I really liked the location. It's in a perfect spot in downtown. I also liked that they had MOTHER EFFIN JUICE POPPERS!!

I purchased a groupon for the mink lashes...it was a pretty awesome deal.  I was nervous as I have never had eyelash extensions and I have only worn false lashes once. I don't mean to brag...ok I do mean to brag; I do not need eyelash extensions as I normally have great long lashes! But my curiosity got me and I wanted to try them.... enough rambling on...  The salon was clean and cute. I got there early and I was given a bunch of papers and i mean A BUNCH to fill out and sign. It was a bit intimidating I must admit. After waiting for about 30 minutes, my eyelash tech came out and introduced herself. She was super sweet. I think Erica was her name. Being a HUGE animal lover, I asked if MINK lashes were real mink fur and she was honest so I opted out and got synthetic ones instead. Anyway, an hour later i laid down on the table, I got up with these long beautiful lashes! I LOVE them! I hardly need makeup now and I've been complimented left and right! Erica did awesome!

My friends and I have been on this thai craze lately and since this place was close by us, we decided to check it out. We walked in and it was empty. We were the only ones in there besides the employees. We kind of wanted to leave but didn't want to be rude. Anyway we got three different dishes and samosa for our appetizer. The samosa was delicious! We almost ordered more but came to our senses. Our dishes arrived and they were dry. I'm used to saucy dishes to soak my rice in. This place not so much. I didn't even have a favorite dish because I disliked them all equally :(  The prices are cheap but they charge you for refills on your drink which is ridiculous. I won't be back. I was hoping they'd be good since they are so close but sadly I was disappointed. Oh well! On to the next!

I LOVED this place...until the last couple of times. The lady screwed up my eyebrows once, but I thought maybe she had an off day. I went back again a fe days ago and she left me with "barely there" eyebrows. I look like a chola and thats not cute. Now onto the next place because I am not going back and you shouldn't either if you like having brows.

I love this place! It took me a while to finally pay a visit but I did it! My first visit here, I didn't eat. My friend and I just say outside and smoked hookah which is AMAZING. As a hookah fiend, I know good hookah! We smoked for two hours and it didn't get harsh!   2nd visit. My friend and I came to finally try the food. I got the khoresht gheyme, which is the split pea stew with beef and it came with rice; it was pretty good. My friend ordered the afghan puolo (I think that's what it was called) but it was DELICIOUS!! So fill of authentic flavors. I definitely recommend that dish. I ordered the doogh, which is the yogurt drink and it was very refreshing.   After we ate, we went outside and ordered a hookah and I got a cup of tea. Hookah, again was excellent. Tea was good. They have "ghand", which are just sugar cubes you have with your tea instead of sweetening it with sugar. My friend ordered the dessert called "bamieh" (okra is also called bamieh, FYI) so make sure state which one you want. They were ok.   Our bill was ridiculously cheap. We expected to pay a lot more than we did.   The servers are super cute and nice. I haven't had a problem with their service. They are very personable at times. They even stayed open an hour later than usual because I wasn't done getting my hookah fix. The place is still new so it's still dead but it has great potential. We will be back.

This place was good...really good! I can't believe this was my first time there since I always pass by the one on central and go to pita house, which is right across the street from here. It's conveniently located from all the places I enjoy going to.  We started out with blood orange martini's, which were the best martini's I've had to date. It wasn't overly sweet and had the perfect amount of alcohol. Delicious! I got the mac and cheese side and the coconut shrimp rolls. The mac and cheese was good, but not as good as lux of course. The coconut shrimp was ok. I would have liked it more if it had been a little more "coconutty." The girls ordered the fish bites, black beans, sweet plantains, and the spicy sea weed salad. They all loved their food and from what I sampled, everything was on point and delicious. I, especially enjoyed the fish bites. It wasn't too "fishy" and was perfectly breaded. All the dishes were almost finished...it was THAT good.   Service was good. Prices were good. Their happy hour seems like it would be good, which I'm pretty stoked to try.   I can't get over that blood orange martini though. Yum!

I'm FINALLY writing a review for this place!   I come here often as shown by my check-ins....so often to where some of the employees wave when I walk in; embarrassing, I know.   My favorite day to come is Tuesday! Why?! Because of TACO TUESDAYYYYYY!! Taco Tuesday means that you get delicious melt in your mouth $2.00 tacos (try the crispy fish) aaaaand $5.00 margaritas! Now, I personally dislike margaritas or anything that contains tequila, except for the ones here! I love the margs here, especially the raspberry-ancho. You can't taste the tequila, but that devil will sneak up on ya after your 2nd drink. But why stop at 2, right?!   I also love their lunch special! 2 tacos and 1/2 for $9.95?! Count me in. All their salads are pretty delicious so I can't choose just one!  The staff is really nice and friendly and The prices are good. What else do ya want?! Stop reading and go get yourself tacos.

I had high hopes for this place after seeing the reviews but it disappointed and I won't be going back.   The chips were thick and stale. The salsa lacked flavor. The Guac was literally just mashed avocado  with a few pieces of cilantro. My carne asada burrito was a rice burrito. It was so overfilled with rice that I couldn't taste anything else. My coworkers fish tacos tasted of pure fried oil. So gross.   The food took FOREVER to come out. We were all done eating and one of my coworkers hadn't even received his food yet.   This place was bad all around and the food say heavy.

The food at this place is probably the nastiest thing I have ever eaten in my life.   I'm not a big fan of buffets but I was decide to try this because it was only two hours and it's Thai!   We walked in and weren't acknowledged for like 3 minutes. Then we were seated and given water but no one came and asked about another drink; we have to track someone down. I tried the fried rice, it was sticky and lacked flavor. Then I got the spicy chicken basil, eggplant tofu, and vegetables. I kid you not, every single dish tasted exactly the same with this nasty sweet flavor. I barely touched it. Then I went to get some muscles. They were dry and were nothing special. We barely ate anything.   My friend and I both ended up paying $17 each. I don't mind spending money on food because I love food..but I love good food. I feel like I would have felt more satisfied with  throwing that money into the garbage instead of that food that tastes like garbage.

They are at our office complex every Friday, and boy, am I glad they are! I have ordered a lot of the food on menu and everything has been phenomenal! They're bistro burger, roasted veggies and quinoa, truffle Mac and cheese, etc., has been delicious and flavorful. I rarely miss a Friday!   The guy who takes my order knows be my first name and the chef is great. They are extremely friendly and personable. I love this food truck! They make my Friday's that much better!

Decor is nice. Crowd is meh. And one star because my phone was stolen here.   I've had my phone laying out everywhere and it's never been stolen. But here, it was taken out of my hand and stolen. What kind of people this establishment allows to come in, is beyond me.   You guys suck.

Alright, Dakota, I forgive you. This place is officially my favorite place in old town. They play the BEST music, no joke. I always have the best time when I go here. The bouncers are nice, the drinks are good, the crowd is eh...but then again it's Scottsdale so not much is  expected from the crowd.

Well, this time it is UNFORGIVABLE!! My phone was STOLEN for the second time at this horrific establishment. In all my years of partying in old town, this has NEVER happened ANYWHERE.   GFY, Dakota. I hope your place shuts down. A-holes.

This place is new so tonight was my first time trying Rotana and I couldn't be more pleased (which takes a lot)!  The interior is beautiful. It is spacious and has lots of tv's and seats. It's very clean also. They have outside seating and they serve HOOKAH out there! YAY!  We arrived here around 7:45ish, and were warmly greeted by the server. We opted to sit outside because, of course, we wanted to smoke. We ordered our hookah, which was out in no time. The hookah was amazing. You can always tell a hookah is clean when it lasts for hours...well we were there until 10:30 and it was still great by the time we left. We never ran out of coals.   The manager/owner came and joined us, which was nice. He is very personable and takes pride in the restaurant...he's very friendly and funny. Oh and good looking! He's single ladies! GO GET HIM! ;)  I didn't try too much food, but the food I did try was delicious. It's a good thing I will be returning so I can try more of the menu. They have excellent service as well.  I definitely recommend Rotana for those Middle Eastern food cravings or just a chill time to smoke hookah with friends.

This was the second worst pedicure service I got (first one was in VA, refer to review).  Upon arrival at 3:15, it looked like a cute salon. It isn't in the best area but it was cleaner and better than I imagined. They told me to go back to a chair. They didn't look all that busy, but may have been a little short staffed.   I waited. And waited. And waited some more. Then someone came and filled the tub with water and all the good stuff. Then I waited. And waited. And waited some more. About an hour of soaking happened. Someone finally came and sat just to get back up and leave so she could go wax some    I saw 3 people that came after me who got serviced first. At that point I was irritated.   Finally, the lady came back and finished my toes. I loved the color but she didn't do the best job. I still gave her over a 20% tip which she wasn't very deserving of. I didn't get out of there til a little after 5. I definitely won't be bringing my toesies back here.

Wishes do come true! I wished and wished for a Lou Malnati's to open in Phoenix and fast forward 4 years, here we are!!   My first visit was about a month after opening. The wait was not that bad around 6:00 PM on a Monday. We pre-ordered just our pizza at the register; the rest of the order is taken at the table. We got a small extra cheese, extra sauce, basil, garlic, and tomatoes with the butter crust pizza. It was EXTRA delicious!! We also got an order of wings. The wings were good, but they do not taste the same as they do in Chicago. Our server was very friendly. My friend wanted pink lemonade, which they did not have. But to our surprise, he went and made it personally for her. So sweet!  My second visit with some of my favorite people was also great! We did not have to wait too long (or it could have been that I was late, of course). We had a pretty big order and separate checks. Our waitress handled it like a champ and took great care of us.   Lou Malnati's in Phoenix gave me exactly what I expected: Phenomenal food and customer service! I will be back...over and over!

I have been wanting to try Poki forever and I finally had a chance to try it. I went here on a Monday evening and it wasn't that packed yet.   It is set up chipotle style when ordering and it was very simple to understand. I got the regular bowl which was $8.95 and came to 2 scoops. I got white rice and organic salad, ahi tuna and Maui tuna, ginger, seaweed salad, sesame seeds, avocado, cucumbers, red onions, and the house sauce. With all that, the regular was more than enough.   I took my first bite.....HOLY DELICIOUSNESS!! Where has this been all my life? Why have Hawaiians been holding out on me for so long!? It was FREAKING delish! Needless to say, but I DEVOURED the entire bowl. It was full of authentic flavors that meshed together very well. The fish was tender and fresh. Everything was just perfect.   If you don't live near this place, it is definitely worth the drive. I will be back soon!
