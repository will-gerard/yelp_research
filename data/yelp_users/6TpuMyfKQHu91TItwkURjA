Two local friends of mine and two from out of town ate here last sunday. My spinach ravioli portion was 4 pieces the size of a saltine cracker. I'm a small person, but the portion was way to small... So I filled up on bread, which was good. One of the men I was with said his Halibut tasted like "fish sticks  on a plate of pasta', he was not happy with the preparation or the portion size. How much does pasta costs!  There must be a shortage! There was 5 of us, we split up the bill, some cash and three credit cards. We were not finished with paying the rest in cash, when the waiter returned our credit cards, he pointed out that so far we had "Only left a 10% tip. Accused us of "Stiffing him' and that he "Had been stiffed all day today!". We pointed out that our bill was $182 and that we had planned on leaving a $45 tip! Which we did because we are not Cheap!  He apologized and gave us a piece of Tiramisu to split amongst the 5 of us!  We were insulted over an OK meal. Keep the change! We won't be back!

This place is the most beautiful Yoga environment I have ever seen! I thought I was at a Spa! The location is quiet and the venue is just incredibly serene. The yoga room is huge and the floor is rubber, which is super comfy for yoga poses. My Deva Flow class was great! The teachers are very professional, well trained! Shosh and Billy are the most gracious and wonderful people and they know their Yoga!  They always show how to improve the poses and modify them to our ability, beginner through advanced levels, there is something for everyone. The bathrooms are roomy and clean with showers and open lockers to store your things. The decor of the entire place is incredibly modern, clean, warm and welcoming. I love it here, you won't be disappointed! Wonderfully calming yet energizing yoga studio! I If you are looking for a place to practice, you found it!
