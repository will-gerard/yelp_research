IMO, best old school tacos in town. Lots of great places to get tacos in the PHX, but these are some of the best. I would especially recommend if you are in the mood for traditional, hard shell tacos. Rice and beans were also delicious. Service was very friendly. Also, very affordable prices. Can't believe this was my first time there - won't be the last!

Be careful with this company - their billing practices are completely bogus. Our 2 boys came to the Little Gym for 3 months. They liked it at first, but then they got bored. So after 50 days, we gave them 30 day notice and were surprised when our credit card was charged again.   It turns out that your "last month's" payment doesn't actually cover anything and they will charge you anyhow. I spoke with the owner about it. She was rude and told me that we were given too big of a discount to start, which apparently justifies her trying to screw us at the end. She made up a ridiculous story about how we begged for a discount (her employees OFFERED US the twin discount).   The owner thinks it is fair that we paid for 4 months of service, when we only used it for 3 months (and gave our 30 day notice well in advance before the 2nd month had ended). We were also charged a random "membership fee" about a month into our experience (we were not told about this at signup). Now I am left to fight this through my credit card company.   My opinion - kids like this place the first few times, but it is WAY too expensive and their shady business practices make it impossible for me to recommend this place to anyone.

Avoid this place. Their trucks are old and beat up. Didn't have the truck I reserved, so the guy there said I could walk next door to Uhaul and he'd cancel my reservation without having to pay. Then they charged my credit card a $50 cancelation fee. When I called, I thought my call would be met with an apology and quick resolution (considering he told me no cancelation fee). Instead, the guy said I had to call an 800 number and that he had nothing to do with the billing. Then why tell people they won't have to pay if you have no control over the invoices? When I asked him, he berated me about Budget being a billion dollar company. I guess that means no customer service in his mind.   I've never been a huge fan of Uhaul, but the Uhaul right next door has newer trucks and friendlier staff.

Stopped by here with the lady friend and to be honest, I didn't have very high expectations for the place. She is an NYPD regular and ordered up a gluten-free pizza, gluten-free SoHo pizza salad and the chopped salad. Everything was DEE-LISH. Love the fact that they have the gluten free options and the food is incredible. The service was great as well.  I will definitely be going back.

Dude, this place just plain rocks. I got the cauliflower potato wrap with gluten free wrap. Crazy delicious! The tomato bisque and mixed bean side were Dee-Lish as well.

This place is run by rude teenagers. The orders take FOREVER, the smoothies aren't very good and if they get your order wrong, they argue with you about what you ordered. Avoid this place!

Stopped in there last week and these guys rock. They are crazy fast and a great value. Don't waste time waiting in line at the MVD - head on down to DCR and get it taken care of quickly (and with a smile).

Saw Alan. Great place, great guys, great cut. Bring your cash though!  This place is worth it to make a stop to the ATM though.

Gluten-free paradise here in Arcadia. I've been here 3 times this week and everything is good. Cinnamon rolls, donuts, sandwiches and pizza. If you are gluten free and in Phoenix, this MUST be your next stop. Just make sure to get there before mid-afternoon. They close at 3 on weekends and 3:30 weekdays.

One of the best kept secrets in Phoenix - hands down! I don't think I have ever had Pad Thai that good before. Even better, they have plenty of vegetarian and gluten-free options. If you are anywhere near North Phoenix, check this place out!

Shady company. Stay FAR away. Once they get your credit card number, they make it impossible not to get charged extra. They make it INCREDIBLY easy to sign up, and very difficult to change your frequency (like canceling all future appts).   I received a reminder notice 23.75 hours before my last appt. I didn't realize that I even had another appt with them as I wasn't all that happy the first time. When I logged into my account, I saw that you have to cancel at least 24 hours in advance to not get charged a fee. In order to try and avoid the fee, I reschedule to the following week. Not only was I charged the $25 fee, I was also charged for the full amount of a 3 hour cleaning ($81). $106 and I haven't even had the appt.   Its like a MLM company decided to get into the cleaning business.

Oh, how I wanted to love this place . We always want to support the businesses in Slope.   On a positive note, the horchata was excellent - not too sweet. The also have a great looking menu with tortas, tacos and cool apps.   Unfortunately, the execution was horrible. We had to throw away both orders of elote (one of our favorite dishes). The corn was rubbery and SLATHERED in mayo. Also, no lime included. No lime with the elote? This was the very first time in my entire life I have had elote I didn't like. They need to send their cooks to Gallo Blanco to check out good elote.   After seeing their PapaNachos dish on Facebook, we also ordered that. The picture showed cheesy waffle fries with jalapeños. Yes please! Like the elote, they were extremely disappointing. No jalapeños - just cheez wiz on waffle fries. Boring, soggy and gross.   We didn't finish any of the 4 items we ordered and left extremely disappointed. I'm being nice giving it 2 stars. With so many good options around (Reyes, Gallo, etc), they are going to need to improve quickly to stick around.  Maybe their cooks need more training - not sure. I would skip this place for a bit until they get this figured out.

So glad to find the previous partner of Tacos Atoyac here.   I'm not so sure about the macho part, but this place is mucho excellent. Tacos for meat eaters and vegetarians (Veggie + Hummus Taco - yes please). The bean burrito rocks and the horchata is excellent. They even have cheesy tater-tots - a serious WIN in my book. If you are in central phoenix or north-central, check this place out.

I've been bouncing around barber shops and salons for some time and finally found a place I can stick with. Made an appointment at Cut Throat last night and these dudes can cut some hair!   Don't just take my word for it. The wifey has officially anointed my current do as the "best ever".  There you have it folks - officially wife certified and approved.   Great haircuts, cool atmosphere, decent prices and online scheduling. I'm not sure what else you would need in a barber shop.   Now stop reading this review and hit 'em up! Your hair will thank you.

This place is great. In the old Citizen coffee spot, they created a very cozy atmosphere. They have fresh fruit and veggie juices, coffee and great breakfast. Even french toast using Noble bread. Highly recommend this spot.

Great new coffee place in CenPho!   The coffee is great and they have vegan and gluten-free options for food. I recommend the Iced Soy Mocha and High Maintenance bowl (breakfast bowl with quinoa, black beans and sweet potato).   I've always been a Lux fan, but these folks are friendlier and have gluten free pastries . That's enough to win me over. 5 stars, easy.

Great plants, a lot of variety and the prices are amazing! I wanted to leave with the entire store. Cacti, succulents, ferns and terrariums - they have it all. So glad downtown has such an awesome plant shop.

Seriously one of the most underrated hidden gems in all of Phoenix. As a long-time Lux fan, I never thought I'd find a coffee shop that I enjoyed as much. I fell in love with Be at the first mocha. I like their coffee (and atmosphere) even better - who wouldn't want to drink coffee while walking around an art gallery?  My office space is on Roosevelt Row, so I'm always there during the week. Now, I'm finding myself driving up there on the weekends as well. If you are anywhere near Downtown, you need to try this place out (allow a few extra minutes for parking).

Good coffee, nice people, cute place. One catch. AWFUL WiFi. If you look at that other reviews, you'll see this is an ongoing problem. Others were complaining, but they don't seem to think good WiFi is important to a coffee shop. I definitely recommend this place if you are just looking for coffee. If you're trying to get work done, go elsewhere until they've figured this out.

Love this place. Simple design, simple menu and friendly people. Oh, and the drinks are amazing. I had the Cascara and the coffee. Both were excellent. Also, they keep it nice and cool, which is surprisingly hard to find.
