One of my favorite places to come. Their salsa and guacamole is to die for. I like that they bring each person their own individual bowl of salsa.   I ways get their huevos rancheros with beans and rice + homemade flour tortilla. Delicious!!!  I eat the entire plate every time.

Wonderful place! I drive all the way from tempe to eat here. It is by far the best thai food i have has in phoenix. I always hve thai tea, the coconut soup with chicken, green curry and if it is the summer FOR SURE the mango sticky rice for dessert! I love this place! I am a thai food snob.

Wonderful studio. The instructors are awesome and i appreciate their demonstrations and workshop tips. They are really great at accomodating all skill levels (even advanced) as well as continuously keeping a consistent flow. I highly recommend hot yoga ahwatukee!  My only complaint is that the owner could be a little friendlier.

Absolutely fantastic folks. Do not let the preconceived notions about guadalupe scare you off.  If you are looking for an honest, reliable shop, this is the place.  Renee and audrey were so sweet and friendly! I had just bought a bike off of craigslist and wanted to get it checked out for a tune up. I called many different places asking for prices. Everywhere else was snotty and STARTED at $40. When i spoke with audrey on the phone she even asked me if i wanted to know what a tune up included which no where else had offered ... This is my first adult bike, so I didn't really know what was included in a "tune-up" in the first place.  i excitedly said yes!   The garage bike shop does a complete tune up for 30-freaking-dollars people!!!  They do not try and upsell you things that you are not there for in the first place.    I would give them 10 stars if i could and will absolutely be going back!

I am what you would consider a mexican food snob. Small, hole in the wall type places are what i live for.   I had the mini chimis (5) with beans and rice... Cost me $10 which is a little steep for me especially given the quality of food.   The chimis had cream cheese and beef in them. More cream cheese than beef. They were sweet. Almost tasted like they were made with a flaky pastry dough or something. The rice was nothing special but their refried beans were delicious. I wish i would have had the option to get chicken ones.   Their salsa bar salsas were nothing special to me, flavorless.  Their avocado + salsa verde one was pretty unique and delicious though.   The restraunt was super clean and a little over the top friendly. Im from the south and enjoy being greeted with a smile, but 4 different times while i am trying to eat? Overkill.   They have a fried ice cream milkshake that i would love to try! I might go back to try that, but that's about it. This place definitely isn't Carolina's/los dos melinos status.
