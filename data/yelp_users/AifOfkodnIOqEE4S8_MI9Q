Never again will I rent from this place or their properties. When I transferred apartments, I get a notice ten days later that they are charging me to replace the carpets for pet "urine" stains. I asked them to send me pictures of the stains and they had to lift up the carpet underneath to get to the stains. I had the carpet professionally cleaned before I left and there were no stains on top. They also said they HAVE to replace the carpet because of the pet smell, when that apartment in fact did not smell anything of pet urine when I vacated.  Adding on to that, they moved me into an apartment that reeked of cigarettes. You know I guess it's okay not to replace the carpet in there though? -_- like seriously? And told me I could "air" out the smell. Anyone that smokes or have been around smokers know that you can't air out somewhere that has been smoked in.  Also I had put in a work order to get my fridge fixed & it didn't get completed for three days. The only reason it got completed is because I went back down to the office to make sure they got the work order, which apparently they did not even though they said they did, and they eventually sent someone over after all my food had already spoiled.  So all in all, DO NOT RENT HERE. I can't wait for my lease to be up and for me to get out of this complex because in all honesty I know I can find a better complex with better organization and one that doesn't try to rip you off.

I love this place! Every time I go here the food is always on point.  Also this is the place that made me discover raspberry vinaigrette dressing for my salads, so delicious!   The portions are big, so they're good to spilt with someone or have enough to take some home with you for the next day! One of my favorite Italian places in the area, no doubt!

Still have not found a better Pho place.  This place might look ghetto af on the outside and inside but honestly their pho is great.  Plus the price is also still the cheapest I've found in phoenix, 4.50 for a big bowl of pho!

I love this place so much. The prices are amazing and you get quality work for the price!  In all honesty this is the only place in phoenix I'll come to get my eyebrows waxed. The older lady that works there always does my eyebrows for me and she does an amazing job each time. She knows how to arch them just right and actually trims my eyebrows as well so they look neat and up-kept. I've had my eyebrows waxed in other places in phoenix but it's just not the same. I'm willing to make the twenty minute drive even to get my eyebrows done here just because no where else does it for me.  I've also gotten my nails done at this place. Never had anything wrong with the nails, and they always look great.  Always will come here to have my beauty needs fulfilled!

I don't know about everyone else but my food is always fresh and fire as fuuuuuuuq when I get it no matter what time of day I go there, compared to the other taco bell's in the area, this one is always on their shit \m/ It's worth waiting the 15 minutes in line for, be patient people can only work so fast, if they got your order right and the food is good one shouldn't complain.

Love this place! Way better then the last AMF I went to on Bell and 32nd street area.  The atmosphere is nicer as well as the people that work there.  The general manager here was so nice to us with the whole process.  Keep it up because good customer service is always a way to get people to come back.

Usually Del Taco is wonderful but this location in particular is trash. Every time I go there I end up waiting 25 minutes for my food that ends up being cold, I don't get it.

This place is my favorite coffee spot in Phoenix. It's also pretty cool you can get alcohol here if you want as well.  Also their Mac and Cheese is to die for ._.

I've been here probably five times now and this place is amazing. Their burgers got voted best in Arizona for a reason! I love their food, and the great thing is the sushi is really great too! You'd think burgers and sushi would be an odd combo but they make it amazing :) I definitely recommend this place for anyone! The shopping cart fries are the cutest ^-^

The Happy Hour here is a yes.  Their Margarita's are pretty damn good and so was the appetizer I had, the tostada. I like that they have happy hour everyday unlike a lot of places which only have it on the weekdays.

This place is amazing.  A little pricey for what I make personally ( but that's on me not on them) and I still decide to go here because honestly it's worth it.  I'm not picky about much but when it comes to beauty and my appearance I always make sure to go with higher quality than lower.  I've had my hair cut here and styled here and every time I go in, I'm never disappointed.  The stylist here know what they're doing, I also love that they're very well trained in "alternative" styles as it's hard to find someone that can do layers and not make it look like a mullet, but hair pollution did that for me! I highly recommend this place if you're looking to get a haircut or even just your hair styled, they def know what's up when it comes to trendy style :)

This place is amazing for their happy hour. The dynamite roll is on the happy hour menu and it is probably just about the most amazing sushi roll I've ever tasted in my life.  Not to mention the inside of this place is adorable and the staff is friendly as ever :) The happy hour has some great rolls on it and it's a good price, plus I saw they have happy hour all day during the summer! Cheap sushi that's good is always a great find!

I love this place, honestly probably the best place to ever do my brows.  I moved to this location because the girl I see (Andrea) worked at the one in Moon Valley (3rd St. and Bell) and I moved with her because that is how amazing she is at my brows.  Honestly I don't think I ever want anyone to ever do my brows again in my life.  All the staff is always super friendly, and when I can't see Andrea the girls they have do my brows still always do a fire job.  I always get compliments on my eyebrows, they're one of the strongest features on my face now because of how well done they are and this is coming from someone who use to HATE their eyebrows.

This place never disappoints no matter what Mellow Mushroom I end up at.  I got the Thai dye pizza and it was great.  One of the freshest pizza's I've tasted in a long while.  Service is quick and nice! It's like most chain restaurants but the food here is hella good :3

We had our Holiday Party here. Every thing was amazing. The restaurant itself was really cute and had excellent atmosphere. On top of that, the food was fresh and amazing and tasted very healthy. I loved the free range chicken I had and the unlimited glasses of Mango Lemonade that they make there at the restaurant was also amazing! Not to mention the service was great :) Just a really great place all around and I'm glad we had our company party there!

This place is bomb as hell.  We didn't know it was on triple d but apparently it was and Guy always has a great taste in food because the chicken sandwich I got was pretty darn good.  The best part is it's hella cheap.  Everything is pretty much under 10 dollars here ;o

Definitely the best chinese buffet I've been to in this area.  They have sushi which is a plus and it's made fresh right there.  I like how big this buffet is too, you get options and it's pretty well priced.  I make the 15 minute drive at least once a month to come here.

I found out about these guys thanks to my aunt, who is a good friend of theirs. They're awesome dudes. In all honesty they always tell me when something is wrong with my car, the prices are always reasonable or even less than most places, and they never take advantage of the fact I don't know shit about cars.  Whenever I do come to them and have them look at my car for problems, if they do find minor things they fix it for me without charge, which in all honesty is amazing. I've never had a problem with their work. They're really good dudes, who do really good work, and know what their doing.

Don't come here if you want expensive amazing sushi, but I'm not that picky to start with.  It's good if you want the basic rolls like rainbow/cali/dragon which are all among my favorites any ways ;3 I love the fact you can get a variety of sushi  for about the same price I spend on one or two rolls I can get a taste of about four or five rolls.

I freakin' love this place. I love that they are open 24 hours a day, this makes it easier for people like me who don't work normal hours.  The prices are great, they compare to that of Walmart which is where I was shopping before.  The only downside to Winco is their selection of items isn't always the biggest selection.  Also sadly their cosmetics/beauty/bath soaps/w/e you call it section is small.  There is not much to pick from and if you're like me you're picky with your items so I def suggest going to Walmart for those items. I also love they have a giant candy section.  Prices are great, and the meat section is amazing you can get a big variety of different types of meat and different cuts of meat! Reminds me A LOT of a Food 4 Less for those of reading that are from the Midwest lol  Also for those of you that know they don't take credit cards, they take debit but no credit!

So I didn't actually buy from them, but my boss gave me a box of their chocolate's that she had. Let me tell you when opening the box I got a pleasant surprise. These are seriously the coolest/cutest chocolates I've ever see in my life.  Now we know looks aren't everything, but also these chocolates are probably the best chocolate's I've ate in my life.  There is such favor with each chocolate and I love how they are the most obscure flavors like thai spice and the chai one!  They're freakin' delicious, that's all I gotta say.

Honestly, this isn't really that great of a restaurant, at least for the pho.  The pho wasn't even hot when I got it, and isn't pho suppose to be boiling hot? I mean the meat is suppose to cook in the broth? Also the wasn't great at all, in all honestly it tasted kind of weird for pho meat, and there wasn't a lot. After two bites all my noodles were gone.   For the money it's not really worth it, the staff was pretty awesome but that's about the only good thing about this place. I suggest going somewhere else for Vietnamese food, this place is really Americanized and more about being trendy, then having great food.

Lydia was my hair stylist! She did an amazing job on my hair cut c:  I'm really picky on who I let touch my hair and she honestly did an amazing job, I found a new salon I can keep going back to because the service is amazing.  The other thing is I usually hate how they(hair salon's) style my hair after they cut it because I have naturally curly hair and I love to straighten mine but she styled it so cute afterwards and didn't even have to use a flat iron!

The line is long here (at least on Saturday nights) but so totally worth it, the Horchata ice cream tasted amazing, it was literally like I had gotten a horchata in ice cream form.  The fact the ice cream comes in a chinese takeout box and you get a fortune cookie with it is the best c:

If you love the old Salty's then DO NOT COME HERE. If you love Scottsdale corporate bullshit then go ahead this place is for you. The old Salty's was amazing, one of the few places in old town I could enjoy because it wasn't full of rich yuppy's and the prices were actually decent and not over priced. They got rid of the best part of this place which was the extensive drink menu with all the amazing flavors of frozen margaritas. Not to mention one margarita was strong enough for me.   Their food also isn't as great as it was, the nachos are now mad with Queso cheese dip instead of cheddar which makes them horrible in my opinion.  This place is just not the same as it was, I really wish they wouldn't have changed the location or how it was set up because it was really one of my favorite places to drink and go to in old town.
