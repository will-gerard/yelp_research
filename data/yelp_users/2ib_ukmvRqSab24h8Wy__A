I'm only reviewing the Pets Hotel here, just to be clear. I take my dog here probably 1-3 times a week for daycare and have since she was old enough to go. The staff there is great. They have gotten to know my dog really well and they take great care of her anytime she is there. I never have to worry when I drop her off there-I know Lissie, Cheyennea, and everyone else will take great care of her.

I love loco. I come here two to three times a week, but this weekend? We decide to come here for the playoffs only to discover a completely different menu - one that is missing half to three quarters of their normal fare - and is about $2 more expensive per item.   Now, I understand that places want to take advantage of the business and the extra people in town. But what about having specials instead of price gauging? Even being a regular, I'm not sure I'm going to want to continue to support a business that wants to charge locals more to visit on a weekend that we happen to have a lot of visitors in town. What is next? Price gauging for the entire month of March for spring training?

One of the best Indian places I've been to I'm a while. Authentic, tasty food. It is a bit expensive, but you get a good amount of good for your money, which makes the cost more bearable. I frequently order take out and they are quick and rarely make mistakes. I do wish though that they would remind you to order rice separately-I always forget!

Wow. How disappointed am I. I placed a takeout order via grub hub, they said it would be ready at 7:15. It is now 7:45 and my food is still not ready. I arrived at 7:10, stood by the bar for 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged my presence. The owner finally acknowledged me, and proceeded to blame grub hub. He never even apologized. I definitely won't be back. Jewel of the Crown is just as good, and at least they aren't rude.

I had an interesting experience here yesterday. I ordered an Americano and the lady operating the espresso machine (I can't call her a barista as it was obvious she's had no training) didn't tamp the espresso. I asked, and she said "we don't do that", which I found odd. I mean, isn't that just coffee if you don't tamp the espresso? Now I was only a barista for 2 years in college, so I'm no expert, so I asked facebook. Here were the responses: "If you don't tamp you're making drip coffee..." "Espresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through finely ground, compacted coffee. Tamping down the coffee promotes the water's even penetration of the grounds." "Your espresso should be tamped;-)!" "If you're gonna make it without tamping go ahead and call it expresso...because it's faster and you clearly don't know what you're doing." My conclusion was that espresso should be tamped so I'll be driving out of my way to Echo coffee until the folks at Buzzberry learn to tamp their espresso.  *I gave an extra star because their cinnamon roll is really good, but I don't know if they actually make them or purchase them.*

I really needed a mani/pedi after my last work trip and this salon had really great reviews, so I thought I would give it a shot. I made an appointment, and they were on time, which was a nice surprise. The nail tech was very sweet (I think her name was Lisa) and attentive, and I had a nice, relaxing time. That said, the mani/pedi itself was not the best I've had. I didn't feel like there were many "extras" that warranted the additional cost over most other salons - I mean $65 for a mani/pedi (including my $10 new client discount) is just a bit steep. She pushed back my cuticles, but didn't trim them, and now they look awful. Same thing with my toenails. I also asked her to cut my toenails short, but she only filed them, which means I'll have to get another pedicure in about a week (I need my nails really short as I'm a runner; I explained this to the tech). Now, not even 24 hours later, my nails are chipping (even my toenails, which never chip). I'm just really disappointed that while it was a nice experience, the service itself just didn't measure up, especially given the price.

Michelle, the owner, is pretty amazing. She reached out to me after my first experience and apologized and offered to redo my nails. I went in just for a quick redo, and she did a great job; I was really pleased. I told her that I didn't care about the frou-frou stuff, that I'm a runner and just need my toes taken care of and she was totally understanding and said they can customize my pedis in the future to what I need. She even recommended another employee who is great at what I want in case she is not available. I'll definitely be going back.

I went for a basic pedicure because as a runner, my feet are always a mess. I went right when they opened Saturday morning and wow, they were already busy! They sat me in a chair, and I waited about 30 minutes before someone started on my pedicure. That was a little frustrating, but the girl did a great job and was very polite. She also let me read my book and relax rather than trying to have a conversation with me, which I appreciate. The owner gave me a $5 off coupon for next time since I had to wait so long, which was very nice of her. The only thing I would have liked was a little more time on the callus removal, as I don't feel like they had enough time. Overall, great job!

I hate to give such a terrible review for a restaurant I love, but the food and wine just can't make up for the horrible service we received tonight. We sat at the outside bar, and he first bartender, Patrick, was wonderful. Attentive, pleasant, and made sure we didn't go more than a few minutes without acknowledgement (and he was busy!). Unfortunately, 30 minutes into our stay, he was tasked with other items and Steve took over. We went about 30 minutes with no acknowledgement whatsoever. We had empty glasses and tried repeatedly to gain his attention, but he apparently thought it was more important to hit on a girl at the other side of the bar than pay attention to his customers. Even when our friend joined us, he didn't take notice - another server stepped in and asked us if we needed anything. Overall it was quite a disappointing experience, especially from somewhere we frequent and have grown to enjoy. I'm sure I will be back, but I will avoid the bar if Steve is working.

I had been looking for a doggie daycare close to my house for quite a while when I stumbled upon this place a mere mile from my house. It is in a strip mall, so it doesn't look like much, but the staff is just awesome. Shayna, the manager, is amazing. She gets to know the dogs and their personalities, so you know they are getting great care.  I have yet to board Bru overnight, as I am hesitant given that there is no staff there overnight. However, I might try it just because the staff is so great. If there were overnight staff, I'd definitely give five stars.

I'd never been here until yesterday, when we stopped by as part of the Urban Ale Trail. I was very pleasantly surprised at how the employees handled the craziness. While some of the other locations were packed and short staffed, these people were on their game. They have a great beer selection, and a really great staff. I'll definitely be back.

So, I'm torn about this review. The food was pretty excellent, but my rating is due more to the service than anything else. We went last night for happy hour, and sat on the patio. Considering it was 100, it was pretty comfortable! The food was great, but the service was horrendous. We had some girl wearing a hippie-type headband halfway down her forehead, who apparently didn't think we were worthy of her attention. I got there and waited 10 minutes for her to take my drink order. It then took another 10 minutes for her to bring my drink. After that, we didn't see her for 30 minutes. We had no water and empty glasses. She kept looking over at us, but never once asked if we needed anything. We had previously told her that we wanted to order food but weren't ready. Finally we flag her down to order more drinks and food. The food is brought by someone else, and the drinks arrive 10 minutes after the food. She didn't check on us once while we were eating. We had to then again flag her down to get the check, which took 30 minutes. We had the cards ready, so at least that was quick, but she never refilled our water (we were outside!), and didn't come back or acknowledge our existence. This was such a disappointing experience, as I've been there multiple times before and have never had bad service.

This is probably the most painful negative review I've written, because I've never had a complaint about anything Kevin Binkley has done. In fact, I always make a point to take visitors from out of town to his restaurants because it is so consistently good.  However, this visit for restaurant week was less than impressive. Now, the service was fantastic, so I have no complaints there. The waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, and just great all-around. But the food was just not up to par. From the restaurant week menu, I ordered the Tempura Fried Eggplant, Pork Schnitzel, and the Coconut Mousse. The tempura was well-fried, but so bland. It came with some dipping oil, and that had some flavor, but I just couldn't believe that the entire dish was so bland. I would have thought there would be some seasoning in the tempura batter. That wasn't the worst though. The pork schnitzel came out nicely fried, but DRENCHED in butter. I probably ate a quarter of my serving because I was trying to avoid the gelatinized butter which covered the majority of my dish. The parts that were not covered in butter were tasty, but unfortunately there wasn't much of it. Had the butter been drizzled, it would have probably been okay, but there was a lake of butter on my pork, which then rendered the schnitzel soggy. The dessert was fantastic, which I expected. I did expect a bigger portion given the portions of everything else we received. My other complaint was the wine pairing. I knew that for an added $15 I wasn't going to get three full glasses of wine, but I didn't even receive three half glasses of wine. I think the three glasses together may have added up to a half glass. I'd have been better off ordering a full glass of wine off the regular menu.  Bottom line, I was just really really disappointed in this experience. It almost seems as though they want to deter people from ordering the restaurant week menu, or they don't want people who are visiting for restaurant week to return. If that was in fact what they were trying to do, it has most likely worked with me.

UPDATE!  So, as you all can see below, the owner called me out as being drunk. First of all, I was not drunk. Some people in my group were, but not me. Second of all, prior to posting that, she emailed me the following:  Libby, thank you for your critique!  I hope that you will give us another chance and would like to offer you a meal on us.  We have only been open for a week and still working to improve our service.  So, I ask. Why call out someone as drunk and then offer them a free meal? Sounds like someone is a little confused/doesn't want to admit to the public that she was in the wrong. I was thinking of giving them another chance, but after reading her comment, not a chance.  So in my frustration yesterday, I didn't take the time to properly write out a review due to how angry I was. Here is my revised review: We came here as part of a stop in the Urban Ale Trail. Now while we may have come due to that, we had been stopping at most places and ordering more beer and food that wasn't part of the promotion. We had a group of 15 and took a large table in the back. After 20 minutes of no service, we were yelled at for taking up a table. Of course, a few of us had sampler beers but we wanted to order more. I went looking for a server, to no avail, and on my way back, an older blonde lady said "get out of the way this is a fire hazard". I explained that I was trying to get back to my table and she said "you shouldn't be over there anyway, this is not for the event-you have to stand over by the bar". I said that we've been looking for a server, as we wanted to order beer. She didn't say a word, just walked away. Another 15 minutes goes by and still no server. At this point the lady running the kitchen walks over and apologizes. The owner eventually walks back up to us and asks why we are still there. We explained that we wanted to order 6 pitchers. She continued to be extremely rude, so we all got up and walked out. A server followed us out and apologized, saying the owner was stressed, but she shouldn't have treated us like that (I left out some choice words that the owner had for us). I can tell you now that none of us will be back. I am appalled that the owner felt it was appropriate to talk to her patrons in that manner. At least her employees were polite and apologized for her.

5 of my friends and I decided to have brunch here Sunday, after reading a New Times review that was pretty positive. Apparently the New Times didn't go for brunch. We arrived early-9am, as we were cycling over and wanted to avoid the heat. We sat outside on the patio, which was nice, aside from the vinyl cushions. Why anyone would use vinyl cushions outside in Arizona is beyond me. Our server, Jorge, seemed nice, although his accent was a bit of a challenge. That mostly just resulted in my asking him to repeat himself, and feeling like an ass.  When he took our order, it was very disorganized. There were only 6 of us, and he asked me three times what I wanted to drink. It took 15 minutes to get our drinks - 3 Bloody Mary's and 3 mimosas. It seemed a little excessive. After bringing us our drinks and waiting another 15 minutes, he finally took our food order. I was only asked for my entree twice, which was a slight improvement over my drink order, but 3 of us were asked multiple times, which seemed odd. Our drinks were empty by that point and we requested refills. We did, after all, order unlimited drinks. That took about 10 minutes. We couldn't figure out why, we were the only people there, aside from other employees. We ordered bacon guacamole and crab guacamole to start with, and we received 6 chips for 6 people. Now they were big, but really?! The guacamole was tasty but the consistency was AWFUL. It was not creamy at all, it felt like a bunch of diced avocado and spices. I wish I'd taken a photo. Our entrees arrived about 15 minutes after the guacamole, which was fine, but my food wasn't hot, or even warm. Lukewarm, maybe. It was still decent, but if it had been hot I think it would have been wonderful. The eggs were poached perfectly, which was impressive, given how often they are overdone. After our food was delivered, we waited maybe 20 minutes for another drink refill. We also had been without water most if the time, I think I asked three times. Why he didn't leave a pitcher, I don't understand. After our plates had been cleared, the check was promptly delivered. We requested separate checks, and he said the best he could do was split it evenly between the 6 of us. At this point we were so annoyed we said fine. We planned on staying and relaxing a bit with a few drinks, but when we asked for more, he said "oh, I don't think I can do that since I closed the check". Somehow he made it work, but wow what a thing for a server to say. We never had asked for the check! The most disappointing part of the meal was the outright passive aggressiveness Jorge displayed after one of our group wrote up a quick Yelp review at the table. She asked for something, and he said, very bitterly, "Of course, Kristina". She was the only person who paid with cash, so we immediately knew how he knew her name (again, only people in the restaurant). We were all pretty appalled at that. The manager stopped by to let us know he saw the review, and he was quite nice, but it didn't really make up for the terrible service. As much as this place has great potential (the food could have been amazing, if only it was hot), the service ruined my experience and I probably won't return.

We were invited for a preview brunch last Saturday. They did a really nice job with the space, even though it was smaller than the other locations. Our server was fantastic; super friendly and attentive. I got the chilaquiles, which was delicious. I also got a Bloody Mary, which I asked for spicy, and they delivered! Overall I was really impressed and I'm very happy to have a Vig in my neighborhood!

I stopped in yesterday morning to have my nails done and as always, they did a wonderful job. I was there for just over an hour and had a gel mani and a pedi. They take their time and always make sure that I am happy with the results before I leave. This is still the only place I will get my nails done.

I will say, I expected A LOT from Okra, since my friends said such amazing things about their multitude of visits. It could have been that my expectations were too high. However, my experience was full of highs and lows. Unfortunately, mostly lows. We dined on Friday May 20 at about 7:30, on the patio (which was quite lovely).  I started with the bright eye, bushy tail, on the recommendation of our server. So, I HATE dairy and in her description she never mentioned that there was dairy in it. Sure, I should have read the description so that was on me. I then ordered a sinister kid, which was delightful.  We had the fried chicken skins and the hush puppies, which were both really tasty. I was quite happy with those. For my main, I ordered the Tennessee hot chicken, which was pretty awful, especially considering how wonderful the fried chicken skins are. First of all, I asked for a biscuit instead of cornbread, great. Well, the chicken arrived with pickles. Normally, if something seems as though it would come with pickles, I'd ask for them to hold the pickles, as they seep into whatever you're eating. But in what world would fried chicken come with pickles? The menu doesn't state this. So, the server (who was awesome) offered to get me a new plate, that was great. Unfortunately, when my plate was returned to me, my biscuit was covered in gravy. COVERED. Back to the dairy thing, I hate gravy. Had the menu said there was gravy, I would have asked for the biscuit without gravy. The gravy also got all over my chicken, and I wasn't about to complain about something else, so I just used my napkin to wipe as much off as I could. The chicken itself was cold and soggy. I have had Tennessee hot chicken plenty of times, and never has it been cold. It was also not spicy at all, which is kindof the whole point of ordering it. I tried my friends' dishes, the meatballs and the beef brasato, which were both far better than my cold chicken. For dessert, we each had a donut, which was good, though very sweet. If you don't like sweet, you won't like this. It was almost too sweet for me, but it was pretty good.  Overall, the starters were excellent, and the drink without dairy was delightful. I wish their menu was more informative and I wish my dish was served hot and not soggy. I would love to go back and give it another try, but based on my experience it would take a lot to get me back there.
