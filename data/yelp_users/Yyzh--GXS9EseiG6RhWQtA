DO NOT GO TO THIS CLINIC! My dog died as a result of negligence by both Dr. Ferrara and Dr. Clinton. I filed a claim with the veterinary board in September and after a lengthy process they finally made their decision yesterday. The findings were "medical incompetence, failure to communicate professionally and a minor records violation" against Dr. Ferrara, who was my vet but I saw Dr. Clinton on several occassions when he was not available. The board also decided to file a claim against Dr. Clinton based on both of their testimonies. My dog was diagnosed as diabetic Memorial Day weekend and was dead right after Labor Day. I went in almost every week to get his blood tested and it wasn't until I finally took him to another vet that I found out how many basic things these two vets didn't check which could have been easily solved. He was so sick that as a result we had to put him to sleep.   The board won't decide their sanctions until the next meeting late January - and I understand he does have 30 days to appeal but I don't think he would be successful after the unanimous votes of the board.

I had the misfortune of holding a group function there today.  I had been in touch with the owner for two days before the event to give her the numbers, which ended up bring 16.  I walked in an hour early to set up.  The set up wasn't quite what I asked for so I asked her to adjust it (take three off of one table and put that at an empty four top.   She seemed very put out but did it.  Her two young granddaughters were the only staff there and the place was empty when I arrived.  My function was called for 1:00 but several guests arrive late and 3 did not show up.  Still we had 13 for lunch.  I saw that there were two other rooms in the back, each having 4 tables of 4.  When I arrived she told me we had to leave by 3:00 (those were her exact words)!  That was never mentioned before.  At about 2:00 another party of 4 arrived and were seated in the back room.  I figured since there were coming in so late they couldn't possibly be closing by 3.  Everything was fine, except for the unbelievably slow service.  At the end, everyone paid their bill and left, except for 2 that stayed behind to talk.  I kept asking for my bill and finally got it - The item I ordered was $8.95.  There was also a $50 charge for room rental.  I told the owner that there was never mention of a room charge and had I known there was, I wouldn't have booked my event there.  She said that since she had to hold a whole room for me and was limited to the reservations she could take, I was being charge.  She began to argue with me and I finally stopped and said - "so you don't mind losing the business of 14 new customers?"  And she replied "No, I don't!".  I tried to reason with her but she kept arguing and was very nasty.  She even insulted my two remaining guests by telling them how messy they were.  I was going to charge the amount and then dispute it with my credit card but I was afraid to give her my credit card.  I ended up leaving $20 on the table and left ($10 more than I owed).  A few minutes later she had left a message on my voice mail telling me I could either come back and pay her or she was going to call the police.    I have never encountered such a nasty women in my life.  I'm glad she feels she doesn't need the business because it looks like she's not getting it anyway.  I had 3 less people than I told her, but she had 7 empty tables in the back so I guess she was trying to make up for her own lost income since no one made reservations.

I just walked away with a check for $282 for my old sterling silver jewelry!  I've sold my gold before and can tell you that Jim gives you a very fair price and he's very nice to work with.  Don't hesitate to bring your gold or silver to him for quick cash.

Went there for the first time last week at the suggestion of the person I was meeting.  She got there early and had a salad before I arrived.  When I arrived she said it was not very good and didn't recommend the food so I just got iced tea and a muffin which was good.  My friend went up to get me a refill and told the person that her salad was not good.  His answer "sorry" and that was it.  He also told her he would have to charge her for another iced tea!  I've never been to a place where they don't give you free iced tea refills.  He had every opportunity to turn the situation around by offering my friend something else or a coupon for next time or not charging me for my tea - but he did none of that.  I wouldn't go back and neither would my friend.

I had my first coolsculpting treatment just a month ago and I'm already seeing results. It's exciting to look in the mirror and see less of me. The office is gorgeous, the staff is warm and friendly and I got to totally relax in luxury. Kim answered all my question and really put me at ease. I can't wait for my next treatment.
