We went to Vogue Bistro for dinner tonight  and the food was excellent. I had the Vogue Burger and my husband had the salmon plus Mac n cheese. The service was really good considering its in Surprise. We were seated outside without being asked if we wanted to sit there (even though there were multiple tables inside with no one sitting at them). At first it was fine until our food came and then there were flies everywhere. Overall I think the food is a little pricey but not insanely unreasonable.

Grimaldi's is my favorite pizza. The staff is always pleasant and attentive. I love the brick oven cooked pizza. Their crust is thin and has just enough crisp to it. I prefer the white pizza that they make. I am not fond of pizza sauce so I'm really glad they have an alternative.   Although they are on the high end of pricing I feel it's worth every penny. My husband and I usually get a large white pizza with sausage and mushroom, which is AMAZING! We always end up with leftovers for lunch the next day and it is still good, even cold.

I LOVE Mr. Goodcents subs!!!! The bread is  always fresh and delicious. I appreciate the fact that they slice the meat and cheese in front of you. Plus they are reasonably priced and WAY better than Subway.   Today I had the turkey and pepperoni $5 special. It was delicious as usual. The staff there are always friendly and pretty quick when making your sub (even though it was lunch time on a saturday and they were trying to make party platter orders).

I received a restaurant.com gift certificate for Fresh Wasabi for Christmas and finally decided to use it tonight. Yes I know Christmas was 5 months ago.  We brought another couple with us and I told them we needed to spend $100 to get the $50 per what the certificate had said. Other than that no restrictions. So we ordered ALOT of sushi rolls, edamame, gyoza and teriyaki chicken.   The food was really good. We stuffed out faces and then we got our bill. We gave our waitress the certificate and debit cards. She then tells us that we cannot use that gift certificate even though there is NO expiration date and states the restaurant is responsible for the discount. We then try to use our Yelp check-in for the free appetizer. She tells us that's not for their location even when we show her where the address is on the deal.  After all said and done we payed our full bill and left. We never would have ordered so much food if we knew they were going to refuse the gift certificate. The customer service was awful and unfortunately that is swaying my opinion of them. I will more than likely never go back because I'm pretty angry over my experience.

Our friends recommended Arizona Frybread to us and it was really good. We got the FB#1 special with four different mini fry breads. Their green chili is really good. It was a little to spicy for my husband but I didn't think it was bad at all. The horchata and the melon peach fresca were delicious! Then we had to get dessert so we opted for the sampler. The fry bread covered in cinnamon and sugar was my favorite (kind of like a churro). The place was very clean and the service was very good.

My husband and I have been coming here for a little while now and we love their happy hour. Well drinks and select drafts are $2 along with half price appetizers. The bartenders are pretty awesome and pour some strong drinks.  We have had most of their appetizers. Our favorites would have to be: meatball sliders, turkey/bacon sliders, southwest rolls and cheese curds. I personally have never had real cheese curds so I'm sure they don't taste like what most people are used to but I love them. Then again who doesn't love fried cheese?

Went here for breakfast and got more than I was expecting. The portions are really big and everything is delicious. I had an omelette with cheddar, mushrooms, sausage, their home fries, and wheat toast. Their home fries have a great flavor and I love that they use rosemary. My husband got the French toast special and a side of bacon. I didn't care for the sausage that came with the French toast and it didn't taste like the sausage in my omelette.   I also suggest getting coffee. Their coffee is absolutely amazing!

I thought Buffalo Wild Wings was revamping itself to make it better. Well they still are horrible.   Went arrived a little after 6pm before the Coyotes Yarnell Practice Game to grab some quick food before we went in. Quick never happened. Trying to get a drink or let alone a refill was hard work.   Our friends ordered potato wedges for an appetizer, it took them three tries to get it right and then some were cold in the middle. Our entrees took over a half hour to come out and they didn't want to give us any ranch for some reason.  We had to ask our server what the status of our food was, she left and came back 5 minutes later saying they are plating it and the manager was personally bringing it out to us and was going to talk to us. A few minutes later he brought our food and said nothing. No apology. Nothing.   We ate our food, except the person who ordered wings because they were so awful he couldn't eat them. Our server gave us a $5 off coupon for our meals. More than likely we will never be back.
