Went to Outback for mine and my husband's anniversary for a quick meal during the week. We sat at the bar so we didn't have to wait. The service was amazing. The 2 bar tenders were wonderful and you could tell they really loved their jobs. The food is always great and came in a good amount of time. This is really the best place to get a quality steak at a decent price. We are never disappointed by this Outback location.

We ordered delivery from Barros and got an XL pepperoni and 24 wings. The pizza here is AMAZING! It's hard to go anywhere else, get pizza, and say it's good after eating Barro's. The whole pizza, cheese, sauce, crust, pepperoni, and spices make this pizza extremely tasty. Again, I cannot reiterate how good it tastes. The wings, were meh, and a little soggier than what I prefer. The buffalo sauce tasted good, but I think the wings would be better if the either fried them or baked them a little longer. I wanted to give them 5 stars overall but feel all items should be up to par to earn this rating. The wings need a little work but were not bad. The pizza is for sure 5 stars. The price is decent too.

Tonight marks the worst fast food restaurant experience I have ever encountered.  This is the last time I will ever visit a Sonic. No other fast food chain I have visited has given me a worse experience than the Sonic on Mckellips Dr. First of all, my son's order was screwed up twice. Then my husband went to pick up his drink, and the lid wasn't properly on the cup and it spilled all over him and his food. Lastly, not knowing that pretzel buns are only for hotdogs, I asked for one on my chicken sandwich and they used 2 hotdog buns and didn't even tell me they don't offer sandwich pretzel buns. Plus, they charged me 2 extra dollars for this creation. This isn't the first time I've had issues with this Sonic. Something is ALWAYS screwed up in the order or the location is out of ice cream. Not only that, any time I call to speak with the manager, they don't care. They barely offer an apology. This restaurant is pathetic and I have many choices in the area, so this will be my last visit to Sonic, or any Sonic for that matter.  It seems that Sonic has no intention of bettering their restaurants. What a shame. Beware and stay away!!

Impact was very professional and friendly. I really liked their customer service. They kept me up to date on the repairs. The repairs were done with quality workmanship and it appeared my vehicle never had any damage. My car was also impeccably clean inside and out. It really felt like I had a brand new car. I highly recommend Impact Auto Body.

This place has a great atmosphere and is something unique. It resembles a mining cave on the inside, and the outside has a really cool patio with a big waterfall and pool. We sat in the dining area surrounding the bar and got great service. The waitress was very attentive and you could tell she really liked her job and was knowledgeable about the entire menu. The chips and salsa were really good. The chips were a variety of white, red and blue corn with a light dusting of spices. The salsas were chunky and very tasty. They bring you red and green, and are nothing like what you get around town. Very good. I ordered the filet mignon tacos, which came topped with cheese, pico, and guacamole on flour tortillas. They were delicious. My husband got the open faced green chili hamburger which was smothered with their green chili sauce and cheese. It was amazing.   We of course ordered drinks. My husband got  his usual beer, and I tried the skinny margarita. It was awesome and reminded me of what an authentic margarita should taste like. I also got the sangria and it was good. Not as sweet as what I normally expect though.  We will definitely go here again with our son this time as they have a kids menu. It's not a stuffy Scottsdale restaurant and has character and awesome food!

I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews but to be perfectly honest, the food and drinks were great. We got quite a few different items between all of us: wings, salad, pizza, hamburger, kids grilled cheese, chicken fried steak, chili, and spinach artichoke dip. Everything tasted great and was presented very well. I am very picky about what I eat and is food was excellent. The drinks were good too. I ordered a margarita and the rest of the party ordered beer & cocktails. They came fast and were not lacking. The service was good too despite the place being packed. Our waitress was attentive and our plates were always being cleared. The dining room is a bit small so if you get there during peak hours, sit at the bar or expect a wait. It has really nice ambiance and is great for families. I recommend going here. Try it out!

I was a bit skeptical at first for trying this place because I haven't seen it advertised much (which doesn't necessarily mean it's good but...). We walked in and the atmosphere is fun as there are sea murals painted on all the walls and overall it's very clean. They played top 40-type music as well which added to the atmosphere. There is an adjoining bar, along with an outdoor patio.  The food was great too. The salsa was very good, which is how I usually judge a Mexican food restaurant. The food was delicious and presented very well. It wasn't just slapped on the plate and you can tell there is some care to it. I ordered a chicken tostada plate and it was very flavorful. The chicken is marinated and was awesome. The plate comes with salad as well, in addition to the normal rice and beans. My son ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was great. It had a ton of meat. My husband ordered the enchilada plate and it was tasty.  The pricing is VERY reasonable.   The service is awesome too! Our waitress stopped by our table at least 4 times during the course of our meal. Our food arrived quickly and we never lacked drinks. You can tell they really care about service.  We will be back! Glad I tried this place.

I've been going here for 3 weeks now, and I love this place. I'm a newbie to Crossfit and it's like nothing I have ever done before in terms of fitness. That said, the coaches here are amazing and knowledgeable. They spend a lot of one on one time educating you on how to do the workout of the day. And they are patient, which is most important to me. They are with you the entire workout and encourage you to do your best. I felt welcomed the moment I stepped foot in there. They also have an awesome kids play room which is a huge plus for me since I have a 5 year old. This enables both my husband and I to get our workouts in. I highly recommend Crossfit Forever Strong!!

I won't be coming back. Period. Most of the food was fine except for my son's cheese flatbread, which was thrown into a basket and soggy. My sister in law didn't get her wings when we got our food and they finally came out 10 minutes later. The service is horrible. The waitress was inattentive and rarely checked on us. The bill was the most confusing bill I have ever seen. They started to split it up by seat but stopped at the 3rd person and threw everything else on the bottom. I told the waitress to change the billing to what a normal receipt looks like and she did. They also did not charge us the correct happy hour prices. The bill also had the food on it that was 10 minutes late. The manager did take care of it removing that item and was very nice. Perhaps they just don't have enough staff here to properly handle the volume because it was packed. Regardless, our experience was horrible.

I was excited to try this concept as I've never been to a dine-in theatre before but it was disappointing. Parking was great and not a problem. There aren't too many movies playing so do t expect the same selection as a normal theater. We got our tickets quickly as well, but ended up only being able to get front row seats. I've done front row seats in a theater before but these in particular were way too close to the screen. There are 2 seat style options. You can choose from a stationary seat like what the typical movie theaters have but it has a small table that swings around in front. The other option was a desk chair that sits at a bar. Since we didn't purchase our tickets earlier, this was the only option and I do not recommend it as it was not comfortable unless you like sitting in an office chair to watch a movie.  We ordered food and I got the California chicken sandwich. What's interesting is this theater prides itself on the food but what I got was mediocre at best. The sandwich bun was soggy and soaked probably from the pico de gallo that was on the bottom of the sandwich. I also ordered a margarita which was terrible. The mix they used was a cheap quality fake lime flavor. I took 2 sips and decided this drink was not worth the calories. Our drinks also came out after our food. Above all, the food and drinks are way overpriced for the quality and value. My bill with tip was around $28 for a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries and the margarita.   I wanted to complain and fix the food, but honestly I was afraid if I complained about both my food and beverage being bad, they wouldn't have taken me seriously. I just won't go back. I recommend getting dinner and drinks at a normal restaurant and then going to a theater that has the comfortable reclining chairs instead.

This was my first time visiting and unfortunately I'm not a fan. I usually seek to give good reviews on restaurants and find as many positives as possible but I could not on this one.   We ordered tacos, quesadillas, beans, and chips & salsa.   The chicken and carne asada meats were delicious, but the rest of the taco didn't come with much else-just cabbage and a hint of red onion. This was mentioned on the menu. They do offer a salsa bar but it only had pico de gallo and a chipotle-type salsa.   The chips and salsa come with a thin salsa and a thicker red salsa that is very tasty and these were not found on the salsa bar. It's unfortunate for customers who do not order the chips and salsa as they won't get these variations.  The quesadillas lacked quite a bit. They were basically a version of their tacos but larger. Cheese was certainly an afterthought and barely visible. Very disappointed.   The beans were probably the worst I've had. Absolutely flavorless.    The restaurant itself is really nice. It's too bad the food doesn't match the ambiance. At first glance of the menu, the prices seem very cheap but now I know the reason why. The menu is very simple, which I like, but they need to go back to the drawing board on a few things otherwise they won't have customers come back.

This was our first time here and I was not disappointed. It was a Monday and we had to wait 30 minutes which tells you something. The place wasn't huge but it was very busy. We ordered beers from the bar and sat on the patio while we waited. They only serve their own craft beer and it changes periodically. When we were seated we ordered the pretzel sticks which were awesome. They came with a beer cheese and mustard. We ordered burgers for our main meal. My husband got the Monday burger special which had chorizo mixed in. He said it was the best burger he's ever had. My burger was very juicy and yummy as well. They had many different gourmet burgers on the menu. They also served other items like chicken, bbq pork and salads. They have Taco Tuesday's which we will have to go back for. They also have a kids menu which was perfect since our son was with us. Our server was really great and took care of us. They also have plenty of staff that bring your food and keep you stocked with drinks and whatever you need. We will be back!!

Love this place! I can always count on what I order to be very fresh. Best of all the menu is super healthy and the food tastes amazing. I always order the Tokyo Bay with chicken. It's addicting!
