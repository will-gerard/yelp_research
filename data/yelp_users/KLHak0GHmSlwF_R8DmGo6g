If the food wasn't good, I'd still be back, since the service is fantastic.   But...the food is awesome.   Get the cannolis.

I have 48 check in's at Chase....It's way past time for a review.  I find it difficult to compare all major league ballparks, so I tend to separate them in to 3 major categories (historic, mutli-use, and new). Chase Field would definitely fall into the new category along with others like Petco, Miller Park, Progressive, etc., so I'm going to judge the field through that lens.   Building (Atmosphere): 3.5/5 stars - The ballpark is typically empty, which is very disappointing since I'd like to see the Dbacks be as successful as they can (aside from the 7 games a year they play the Cubs). The crowd will occasionally get behind the team, but on a typical weeknight, it can be pretty quiet in there. I've been to playoff games, which are much more lively than a regular season game. But overall, it's about as quiet as a library. I have an appreciation for games like this, but it's not a regular MLB ballpark setting.  Building (Physical): 4.5/5 stars - The building is a very impressive structure and the sightlines are great. I've sat all over the ballpark, and never felt ripped off for a ticket price. Air conditioning, retractable roof, giant Jumbotron, activities to keep the kids busy, and plenty of other entertainment; the Dbacks have thought of it all. One thing to keep in mind though, the ballpark is a MUCH BETTER experience when the roof is open. Baseball was meant to be played outside.  FOOD: 4/5 stars - There's plenty of food options (pizza, hot dogs, ice cream, burgers, even Chinese), but I'll just recommend the best places. Make sure to visit the tamale stand down the 3rd base line - it's in a cart on the inside of the concourse - and the specialty hot dog location - outside of the concourse, 3rd base line - for something quick. If you want a sit down pre-game meal, there's a buffet underneath the stands behind homeplate (approx. $27.00 - I think) that is VERY good.  Value: 5/5 stars - Keep in mind, this is a value ONLY for a MLB ballpark. It is still an expensive afternoon for a family. However, ticket prices and food prices are relatively reasonable. I recommend bleacher seats for the best value on tickets. The Dbacks are offering a $19.00 deal for a ticket, 2 sodas, and a hot dog. Food-wise once you're in the ballpark, the best value options are Panda Express in RF and the value deals at the concession stands.  Service/Organizational: 5/5 stars - A few years ago (pre-Derrick Hall) I would have given the Dbacks a 1/5 rating on this. Now, they've become a first-class organization. Every employee I come in contact with has been pleasant and helpful. Obviously, you see ushers and vendors more than anyone, but the front office is also great. The Dbacks are gaining national attention for being the best organization in sports, and they are very deserving of this honor.   Overall, if you get an opportunity to attend a game at Chase Field, DO IT! It's a great ballpark and an enjoyable and memorable event!

Wy-Knot? The service mainly.  This morning, I "attempted to" have brunch with a friend at this restaurant. The reason I use "attempted to" rather than "did" is due to our 10:46am arrival at the restaurant resulting in a 12:02pm serving of our meals. I have been operating under the impression that 14 minutes in industry standard for seating to serving; evidently this establishment is not standard.  Simply put, we had breakfast for lunch.    MEAL SUMMARY (-2.5 / 5):  10:46am: Upon arrival, we were begrudgingly greeted by the server, who informed us our table (the one inside the restaurant with patio chairs - you'll know what I'm talking about if you still go) would be ready once it was cleaned. Why the previous patron's dirty dishes were still sitting on the table is beyond me.  10:51am: We were seated and promptly ordered coffees and waters. The coffees came quickly. We ordered our meals as the coffees arrived, and the waters came minutes later.  11:05am: I thought for the first time, "I wonder how much longer till my food arrives?"  11:08am: Our server refilled our coffees.  11:17am: I noticed others arriving at the restaurant were receiving their meals. I had not received mine.  11:21am: I realized the splattered painting right by my right shoulder was for sale for $2400. I doubt anyone will purchase it.  11:27am: Our server refills our coffees and apologizes for the delay in our meals. She informs us their POS system was having problems and failed to generate a ticket. She asks us again what we ordered and says it will be the only ticket in, so our meals should arrive quickly.  11:35am: My friend and I have a conversation where we made fun of a mutual friend behind his or her back. I briefly forget my oppressive hunger and dropping blood-sugar levels.  11:43am: The male server refills our coffees and informs us our meals will be our shortly. As he leaves, he pats me on the shoulder and says, "Thanks for the patience, bud." I do not know him and doubt we'd be buds if I did.  11:50am: Every customer who was in the restaurant at our arrival is gone.  11:52am: My friend becomes agitated at the delays. We discuss how much of the bill should be comped due to delays. We agree 50% is fair for us to give Wy-Knot another try in the future.  11:54am: I wish we would have gone to Matt's.  11:56am: Coffee refill #5. I've drank a lot of coffee.  12:02am: Our meals arrive. I do not remember the next 12 minutes.  12:14am: I'm full.  12:16am: Our bill arrives. We have been compensated for one of the coffees. I become the agitated one. I ask if that's really the best they can do. The server goes to speak to the manager.  12:19am: Our bill is reissued with a 10% discount. I decide I will not return in the future.  12:25am: Departure.    FOOD REVIEW (3.5 / 5):  I had the stuffed cinnamon french toast. It was good, but seemed overpriced at $12.00. A good breakfast in Phoenix, but not anything amazing. Banana and vanilla flavors went nicely with the toast, and the portions were large. Plus .5 for the side of bacon.    OVERALL:  Wy-Knot would have a desirable dining experience with much better service. There are other breakfast places in the Midtown and Arcadia neighborhoods I would visit before this one.

Great spot to relax and have a glass (or bottle) after work. Able to enjoy the cozy atmosphere, which is rare in central Phoenix. And the wines are fantastic. I'm a fan!
