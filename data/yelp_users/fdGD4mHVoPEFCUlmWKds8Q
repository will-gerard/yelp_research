RUDE! I dropped off some textbooks, gave them my number, and left to run errands. I got lectured by a young girl with blonde hair and glasses that I was not ALLOWED to leave the store. Excuse me? She said I was gone for HOURS. I was gone an hour. Deal with it.  These people need to learn some customer service skills!!!!!     I actually was the manager of a book store a few years ago. I would never dream of speaking to customers that way!!!! I will not be back.

Fun. Inexpensive. We had a Groupon and I took my three kids. We had a great time. Super friendly staff....I would recommend this place for anybody who wants to roller skate!

Blessed are the hipsters, for they shall inherit the Liberty Market! They bring us BeeGees blaring in the background and shopping carts as decorations.  But the cliches are forgiven. The place has style AND good food.  I ordered biscuits and gravy, a relatively difficult meal to screw up (and yet many do screw it up) and it was stylishly served and very very tasty.  Does food taste better on a square plate? Does food taste better when sitting on vinyl green booths? The answer is clearly yes....come enjoy....

Nice seats, but not enough staff. Long lines at the concession stand.

Tried this for the first time yesterday. It was blazing hot and the water was wonderfully cold. You need a nice afternoon free cuz it takes about four hours once you start your float down. Bring sunscreen, ropes and a squarish cooler for lunch and beer or soda. (Also marshmallows, not for eating....trust me on this ;-)   Please reapply sunblock! You will fry otherwise!!!!  My only concern would be for those who want to bring younger kids. First of all, ALL kids must be over the age of eight. Some of the rapids can toss you around a little bit so just keep an eye on the kiddos. Plus, there are lots of college kids drinking. Now, we had no problem with them, but some drunk guys did ask me to show them my boobs. They took my refusal in stride, but maybe it isn't appropriate for small kids. Some girls will flash and maybe you dont want your kids to see that....so....just a warning.  Otherwise we had a great time. I will definitely be back!

I was super pleased with Dr. Zinn and his staff. My poor Petey had been losing weight and urinating a lot. We believed he had diabetes. Sure enough, Dr Zinn confirmed our suspicions and really helped us transition into new care for our dog. He was very clear on what would happen. He had his aide explain how to give shots, how we might have to adjust the medication, and even safely disposing of his needles.  He never tried to up-sell us on tests we didn't need.   The staff was super-friendly! And my bill at the end wasn't terrifying!  Good job guys!

I love this little diner.  We had a great waitress and eager pleasant service. Food was classic diner food. It was a nice little place to stop after hiking in the Usery Mountains.  My only complaint is that it is on Apache not Main.  GPS is correct, but at some point there was a street name change so be aware to turn on Apache. There is no Main Street this far east.

I have never been in here when it's busy; however, the bagels are excellent so I am always surprised the lines aren't wrapped around the corner. Today I had a Sedona Bagel sandwich - bacon, onion jalapeno cream cheese on an everything bagel. Excellent!  I will say that the building isn't really fancy, but I don't care. I'd rather have good food and meh atmosphere then meh food and great atmosphere.

I really enjoyed my stop by the Cozy Corner Cafe. I had passed it many times while shopping at Kohl's and swore to stop by. This morning I did! And I am glad I did! I had prompt service by friendly waitresses, fresh hot coffee with swift refills, and a lovely chorizo burrito smothered in salsa.  It was tasty. The chorizo was crispy and spicy. Personally, I love chorizo burritos and this is probably one of the best I have had!  Overall, it's a simple diner. The food isn't fancy, but it is good. They had a large breakfast menu. I will be back to try more! Only one warning, there are only two larger tables for large parties (more than 4) so it is not the best if you have a big group.

Well, I have lived in AZ for 16 years and finally decided to try this Pete's I have heard so much about. We were in line with 10 other people and it moved really quickly. I didn't have cup holders in my car for all the drinks and the staff got me a box to carry everything. They were super helpful. The staff is really excellent; however, the food is so-so.  I really was looking forward to something more authentic, not a pressed patty I could have purchased myself at Costco.  If you want really good, authentic fish and chips go to either Rula Bula in Tempe or  RT O' Sullivan's.  The best word for this experience was "meh."  I can't say I ever plan on going back. And now I know I haven't missed out on much in the last 16 years.....

My kids and I decided to go on a little adventure.  We didn't know what to expect, but we figured we'd have lunch and leave if it was lame....instead we found ourselves pleasantly immersed in a scenic, windy drive through the mountains.  We dipped gently into the beautiful Canyon Lake area where canoes, jet skis, and the Dolly Steam Boat went about their way.  Gorgeous!  A couple miles past the lake we found the saloon.  It had lots of local color, saddles for seats, and some really good prickly pear ice cream.  This is a nice stop for a brief afternoon jaunt.  Eat some ice cream. Visit the lake.  Have lunch at the saloon.  Good times!

I'm from Indiana originally, so I just had to stop by. And like Indiana this place is nothing fancy. It is simple breakfast faire. Nothing unique or crazy going here. You will probably never see any experimental cuisine, but overall it was good and inexpensive. I got a chorizo burrito with salsa and paid about $5.  The problem with chorizo burritos is a little chorizo goes a loooonnnnggg way and I have been overwhelmed by other restaurants' versions; however, the Hoosier Cafe did a fine job of balancing the flavors of potatoes, eggs, and chorizo. The salsa was also delish.  Overall, don't come with grand expectations. This is a simple, kitschy place. But the food was good!  And ultimately, isn't that what you go out for?

Super cute antique store downtown! I only had one problem...no air conditioning. They just had fans and swamp coolers so it was still close to 90 in the buidling, but they had some really cool old things, unique crafts, and furniture. I will certainly be back when the weather cools down!

This place is great! Lots of activities...lots of game nights...Dr Who events....We love it!  Staff is super friendly.  Overall, I can not say enough great things about this shop. Plus, my son has autism. He can needle people with obscure, odd questions and these guys totally answer every single one.  They go out of their way to make him feel welcome and respected.    It is easy to be nice to be people who are nice to you. However, with more eccentric people, I find some folks shy away from talking to them. Not these guys! Thanks for respecting my son enough to engage with him.

Delicious beautiful food! I had the Squash Oat bowl at the Gilbert Farmer's Market. It was DEE-LISH.....  and very fresh tasting.    Just a warning....they use no sugar or much in the way of fats, so the food may come off as a bit bland for those not used to natural foods, but it is worth giving a try.  You will feel energized the rest of the day!

I have never been a "salad" girl....you know the one that just LOVES salads. But in the last year, I have found myself wanting a lighter lunch with healthier options.  Lots of places claim to be healthy but they really aren't....(if your side dishes are chips and a cookie that isnt better than a side of french fries)  I have recently discovered this place and I have fallen in love. Lots of salads and soups and probably the best grilled cheese I have ever had. Today I had the strawberry chicken salad with cauliflower soup.  The salads are fresh and flavorful. The soups are the best I have ever had.  Overall, its a good option for those who need something other than the burger/fries or taco lunch!

I have now been three times to Backyard Taco, so I must amend my first review. Today I got the Crazy Potato and loved it!  The cabbage was fresh and added a wonderful note of sweetness to the entre...I think I have been converted!

Deeelish! I came early one morning with my son. He had a BLT which he devoured. I had a the South Mountain Biscuits which was eggs and ham on top of a bicuit smoothered in gravy. It was great!   May not be good for groups becuase all the tables are boothes. Maybe if you had just 6 or 8 it would be fine otherwise, the set up is for about 4.  Otherwise, it was great!

We really enjoyed dinner here the other night. I got the Pollo Fundido which is a fried chimi stuffed with chicken and covered in cream cheese and cheedar. Seriously....how could that not be good?  My only complaint is the salsa is a little thin. I  like a chunkier salsa, but that is hardly anything that would stop me from going back.  We had no waiting and a quiet dining experience. Two thumbs up!

Very good. I tried this place for the first time today and I really enjoyed my sub. I had the Kevin Bacon with dirty sauce. My husband had the Pat Tillman. Overall, it was probably one of the best sandwiches I had ever eaten.   Also, the service was great. And the building was clean and inviting!  Go to Ike's. You'll love it

Welp. The beer is good and the service is good, but I have had better food. We had the burrito, the green chile mac and cheese and the poutine. All the food was completely flavorless. There was a strange burnt flavor to the burrito I am supposing was chipotle? But it didn't taste of spice, just burnt and smoky.  The poutine had no gravy or queso fresco.  And the mac and cheese needed salt. In fact, everything needed salt. It was like eating food when you have a cold.  There was no taste to anything. My husband raised his eyebrow and asked if I felt the food was flavorless and I had to agree.    Overall, unimpressed. We will not be back.

My dinner last night consisted of a sesame bagel and a handful of tiny candy bars, so I figured I should try to eat a little better today.  I have wanted to stop by this place for awhile and swung by for a juice. I got a small Little Beet (16oz) and it was great!  The gal asked if I wanted ice and I said yes. Thankfully, they gave me a larger cup. Same amount of juice, just more room for ice!  It was fresh and delicious!  I will be back!

Really delicious! I must have driven passed this place a million times before we finally decided to stop. It was super slow, and the employees were super friendly. We ordered a Philly Pita and a Gyro Pita with a side of falafel.  Usually, I am not a fan of falafel, but this was crispy and flavorful served with a side of hummus. The pitas were generously sized (quite frankly, more than I could eat!)  The servers were super excited to help out and very friendly....I will be back!

I went there the other day with friends and found some delicious goodies!  I had the half sandwich and soup. The tomato basil soup was outstanding.  My 1/2 sandwich was more like a whole sandwich and my friend's whole sandwich was actually two sandwiches! But my favorite part was the cannoli! It was hearty, but crispy with a lovely thick cream filling. Next time I try the squash ravioli everyone raves about!

This is the classic mistake most restaurants make - they value style above substance.  Though it is a beautiful sandwich shop, the food is mediocre. We were served by beautiful food by beautiful teenagers that had little flavor. I had a dry, tasteless chicken panini that cost me almost 10 bucks. (That's another gripe of mine- why the heck does a sandwich with a fancy name have to cost 10 dollars...its a frickin sandwich people!)  You could serve me dinner on a paper plate with greasy napkins and I would be happy, provided it actually tasted good.  That is why I go out to eat....to eat good food, not tasteless, stylized drivel.  Make the food taste as good as it looks...otherwise....what's the point?

I have wanted to stop by and now I am really glad I did!  The salads are super fast, super fresh, and super healthy!  We spent more time deciding what to order than it took for us to get our order.  I am really excited that people are embracing some healthy food options. Everyone keeps telling me go to Subway because its so healthy and I am sure it can be, but mostly people get meaty cheesy subs with chips. I hardly consider that healthy.  This is a refreshing option! I wish for their continued success!

This is a middle of the road, far from authentic, but still an okay-ish Chinese place.  While edible, it lacks any fantastical flare or sumptuous taste that would lead me to give this more stars.  We had tofu, chicken and beef dishes that left us really wanting more. "Well, " my husband said, "It was better than a sharp stick in the eye." Yup. Kinda meh.....
