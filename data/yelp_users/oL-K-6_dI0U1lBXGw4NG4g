i don't use profanity in my reviews, but i cannot find any other words that can express the hot wings.  they are so fucking delicious it's ridiculous.  the chicken wing is cooked well, where it gets crispy and is juicy in the middle.  there is little fat, you you are actually eating a chicken wing.  i pretty much ate everything off the bone.  they have many different kinds of sauce you can select, mild to suicide, honey, bbq, and those sweet flavors with heat for any taste you're in the mood for.  the hot sauce (the step down from suicide) with the wing itself, created the most delicious hot wing i ever had.  it had heat and flavor, without too much of a vinegar taste.  i seriously wanted to lick the plate.  on wednesday their special is 10 wings for $3.00.  the only reason why i did not give this place 5 stars was because of the bartender.  the drinks were weak.  they use canned juice and red bull instead of the bulk or spout kind, which i appreciate the taste.  i went up to the bar and said i wanted to do a shot.  i am spoiled and don't know the names of any shots (my regular bartenders knows what me and my friends like and will just randomly make stuff that he knows we'll like).  i tell the bartender vodka is ok, no tequila, something that tastes kind of like fruit punch.  she rolls her eyes with her hands on her hips and mentions they don't have any fruit punch.  i mention that the only thing i can remember the name of is the around the world, and she told me you can't make that into a shot.  hahahaha, that's pretty much all i know it as, she was ridiculous.  she made this grape and pineapple juice crap that hardly tasted like booze (i saw her pour, it was pretty much just juice).  aside from her, the server, who was nice, got mine and my friends drink mixed up.  she had a red straw in the one she thought was the raspberry, but the mandarin was made in that glass, so we switched.  when i ran out of my drink, i asked for another mandarin red bull and she brought me a raspberry since the red straw was in it.   they do karaoke on wednesday and another night i cannot remember.  the selection of songs is great.  there were newer songs.  they had amy winehouse, hot hot heat, panic at the disco, fall out boy, the entire rent soundtrack (which my friend was excited about).  the ones i was amazed to see were teddy geiger, ryan adams, and jeff buckley.  and if that wasn't all... fuck her gently by tenacious d.  my friends and i have wanted to sing this song at our bar forever, they wouldn't even let us sing it a capella.  it was so rad to sing it, it was like some great accomplishment.

the espresso is smooth and delightful.  they have huge cups for their ice drinks.  i got 3 shots over ice for about $2.50.  fair deal.   i got a toffee coffee blended drink, i like the bits on top, but the drink itself was kind of lacking.  it wasn't bad, just wasn't great. i would hang out here if i lived in the area, there is outdoor and indoor seating.  they have people play music from time to time as the fliers suggested.  there was a good crowd at both times when we went, first in the evening, then mid morning.

in california, sweet tomatoes are souplantations.  i wanted to eat here just because i've only eaten at souplanations, and i love them.   the location is in a good area.  plenty of parking and seating.  the two lines of the salad bar were well stocked, fresh mixed salads.  the iceburg was crisp, very little brown bits.  the other veggies looked fresh, though i don't like most of them.   there was an abundance of most everything.  they kept everything well stocked for being lunch time. during april, they have a bunch of lemon stuff.  the lemon cream pasta is so good.  so refreshing and simple.  the major disappointment was their sourdough bread.  had the consistency and taste of dense french bread.  not the normal sourdough bread they usually have.  they were also stored on the side of the buffet line, not kept warm.  so it was just a complete let down.  great customer service.  they stopped by more often than the ones i am used to and they ask how you are doing.  it was nice.

for the ambiance and idea behind this coffee shop, i give it two stars.  it's cute, they have a nice espresso machine.  the espresso was bitter.  i paid $3.00 for 3 shots.  i added my sugar and half and half at the some what dirty side bar (mostly drips and sugar crystals about, but dried liquid, so it had been there a while).  about 3 sips into the drink, i got a huge clot of half and half that must have fallen into my cup from the container as i poured it.  i couldn't bring myself to drink much more, i took the lid off and sipped it, but it was not that great, so i threw it away.  i don't know if i would try this again, seeing as the major part that sells me on a coffee place is the quality of coffee, and the cleanliness of the place.

i am drunk.  thank you to the wonderful bartenders at the bar, i got pretty sloshed.  enough to phase out the countless number of boobs i saw.  this is the first strip club i ever went to.  having known the daughter of the dj and a dresser of the dancers, there were some things i saw that would not have happened had i just attended this place... but all and all, i had a good time.  the dancers picked good music, so the general atmosphere was nice, and sitting at the corner of the bar, i saw minimal boobage, it was a good spot.    this is certainly a fun time to be had, even if you aren't into strip clubs, because the bartenders know what they're doing.  i am drunk.

this place is the reason why i had the wonderful idea to open my own coffee shop.   they have quality coffee, not bitter, very smooth.  they have cute names for the drinks.  though i don't like banana, it's rad that the banana mocha is called the monkey and the engineer.  their pastries are very large, decent price.  haven't tried them though.  they close at 6pm, so it's best to just stop by in the afternoon, sit out back and just chill.

i could see myself spending major amounts of money at this place if i lived here.  it's a well organized bookstore.  the sections are well defined and in a logical order.  they have a bunch of knick knack items and new books as well as used books.  you can trade in your old books.  they have stamp cards, for every $100 you get $10 off your next purchase.

the guys that work there all do amazing work.  my tattoo came out better than i hoped (as simple as it was).    they have a nice set up, each artist has a good amount of space within their sections.  it's clean.  felt very comfortable in there.  and they entertain you.  movies playing on tvs all about the place.  i will certainly get more work done here.

star deducted as my first selection was not available, nor was my second.  so i ended up with a 9 grain bagel, toasted, cream cheese.  and a blackberry orange lemonade.  the bagel was great.  sunflower seeds, rye, and a bunch of stuff i couldn't identify.  the drink was a bit too sugary.  not much lemonade, mostly syrup taste.  my friend and i actually stopped there the other day and got a couple bagels to tide us over for a few days.  they are large bagels.  airy inside, tasty, and crisp crust.  they don't keep for that long.  the breakfast ends at 10am.  the dinner doesn't start until 3pm.  so i was limited to soup or salads as my options, so i went with a bagel.

oh the kitchiness of the dessert... the walls are covered in one dollar bills.  all are signed by patrons and passers-by.  the bathroom has painted women (old west attire).  the bar has saddles that you sit on instead of stools.    moving on to the food. the water had a chlorine/salt taste to it.  their dr. pepper didn't taste much like dr. pepper, i think the soda water must have been fizzled out since there was little carbonation.   they had a cheese crisp on the menu for $7ish.  it is a giant tortilla, covered with cheese, another tortilla, more cheese, and green chili's.  i peeled the chili's off, the flavor left was nice.  the cheese was a bit thick,  there was nothing all too exciting about this appetizer. i got a burger with fries.  it was cooked well, which i like, but didn't ask for.  the fries were not too thin, mostly soggy (which i like).  not wet soggy, just the not crisp kind. the chicken strips were larger than normal.  the cheese enchiladas are wonderful according to the one eating them.  as if they made the sauce themselves.  the blt was minimally built, very little bacon, considered "eh."  the waitress was nice, but flighty.  she wasn't direct with us, just kind of there.  when we asked for bbq, or refills, she never looked at us, but responded as she walked away.  didn't listen to our orders completely.  it was asked that chili's be put on half the crisp, but was on all of it.  i asked for just pickles on my hamburger, but it was naked.  the drive there is pretty.  i wouldn't see how anyone would be driving through here on a road trip, but if you are, it's not bad, but not wonderful.
