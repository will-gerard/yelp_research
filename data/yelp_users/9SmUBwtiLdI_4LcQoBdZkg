My boyfriend had driven by several times and since we live in the neighborhood we decided on a whim to pop in and are so glad we did! Read some other reviews that recommended it as a good date spot and I agree. Dim lighting and great service were good starters. My bf got the slider to start then we got skewers to share. They were awesome.  For entrees my bf got the tenderloin and I got the surf and turf pasta. My bf happens to be a foodie who has traveled the world so when he likes a place it is outstanding- and he did! I loved my shrimps as big as a baby's foot and the beef was so tender. It was melt in your mouth good.  To finish I had the bread pudding which we were told were made from croissants that they make onsite fresh everyday. It had a lush sauce that went with it but it wasn't too heavy. Perfect end to a great meal. So glad this is a local place that we can add to out favorites.  As far as cost- you can get out of there for $40 for 2 and have a good meal or you can get the higher end dishes which will run you a bit more. Great place and we will be back soon!

I love any art and cluture and being so close to downtown I try to soak up as much as I can. I would love to see the Phoenix Art Museum do more with and to support local artists. There are so many talented people from Phoenix, Sedona, Jerome.....all over the state. Why not celebrate them? I'd love to see more locals!!

I am lucky enough to live right around the corner from this CenPho favorite and it is truly one of the best things about living in Central Phoenix. This is a great place to bring out of town guests for a unique Phoenix experience- not at all your typical chain restaurant food. I don't think I have ever had anything there that wasn't above my expectations. I have gone for special occasions, out of towners, or just lunch with friends. Any time of day is great and the food is consistently awesome. The sweet potaoe fries rock and my all time fave is the lobster quesadilla's- yummm!  Can't say enough good stuff about this local fave.

I had a perfectly lovely experience here for my daughters first haircut! She is 3 and given the reviews I read I was on guard and prepared for the worst but I also know the bad experiences get posted and not always the good so I took a shot. The 2 stylists were very nice and when they saw my daughter they "fought" over who got to give her a cut. Julia "won" and let my baby pick out a movie and a car to sit in (she picked the train). Since my daughters hair texture is a lot like mine I gave her my thoughts on what should be done and listened to everything I said and we ended up with a beautiful cut. She then styled my girls hair with a cute side braid (which I could never ever do myself) and let her pick out a colored ribbon (green).  I will for sure come back and will probably have Julia style her hair before our next family photos are taken. We did get the first haircut keepsake as promised as well. Nothing fancy but it was nice to get it.  So for you worried moms I say give them a chance. They exceeded my expectation.

This is a great find and a great addition to the Arcadia area! My family stopped in for lunch  and was very pleased with our meals. I had the Cuban which was great and my husband had their burger. You can tell they are using fresh ingredients and there is a lot of attention to detail in the entire experience. I am looking forward to coming back and trying their nosh boards! It seems like a great spot to bring a group of friends for drinks (great wine selection) and we def want to come back and check out brunch which they serve until 5pm- bonus!  This place really deserves some love from CenPho people and I hope you all check it out!

I am very disappointed with my experience here. This was our (my husband, daughter and myself) 3rd visit and while not impressed our previous times today was a disaster. The hostess was extremely rude, the service was non existent and the food was cold. The table next to us got their food, ate and left before we got our order with no apologies or explanations. We had brought a guest with us and frankly I was embarrassed because the location was my choice. I don't see how this place rates the rave reviews I have heard. I am not sure if it's because we have a small child and they are targeting the hipster crowd but we felt very unwelcomed and unwanted there. Very sad and we will not be going back.

I went to their new location at Town and Country mall- its great to see any new biz go in there but especially one as yummy as this! You can taste all the yummy flavors before you try them and after sampling a few I decided on Cake Batter and Peanut Butter. Then I saw all the toppings and am sorry to say I kinda lost my mind. Pehaps I didn't need cookie dough, and chocolates chips (3 kinds offered), sprinkles as far as the eye can see, peanute butter cups AND chcocolate whipped cream but that is what I ended up with....my boyfriend went the fruit topping route and got equally as crazy. The next time I will def edit myself a bit.  What can a girl do though? Hot day, cold yummy yogurt and out for a treat with the man I love....how can you not love a place that brings all those things together? It was a bit pricey but you pay by weight and I blame myself for going nuts...and more importantly I loved it so much I didn't care what the price was! Can't wait to go back and bring more friends....yay!!

Wade Lee is amazing! He went above and beyond on my wedding day! He is not only way less expensive than almost everyone else I priced out for hair and make up he included a free trial and did my sister's hair and makeup for a VERY reasonable rate! He drove up to Sedona to do my wedding for a small additional fee and due to a small snafu he was the one who ended up helping me get in my wedding dress! My family has totally adopted him and he made everyone feel special- not just me! I can without a doubt say that my wedding day would not have been the same without Wade there! I am not just a very satisfied client I feel I made a new great friend!!

This was my husband and iIs first time here but I can tell ya we are probably going to make a regular stop- our massge therapist (The Art of Touch) is literally across the street so it is super easy for us. Lunch and a massage? Yes please!  I had been craving Ahi Tuna so I had their Ahi Tuna sammy which although messy was good and totally hit the spot. I also liked their hand cut fries which were just a bit salty for my taste but other than that were pretty good. My husband got the eggs benedict which they were happy to serve even though we missed the brunch hours. They use a bernaise instead of a hollidaise sauce and filet instead of ham. My husband was taken aback at first but with each bite found it more interesting. I should note he is a huge eggs benny snob and it is his quest to find the best eggs benedict in AZ (so fas Scrambled in Phx and The Barking Frog in Sedona are the faves).  It was hot so we didn't sit on the patio but by looking at it I can see it as a super cool place to hang out in cooler weather and I am for sure coming back to try the dessert- I am a sucker for red velvet cake and was crushed I was too full to have some this trip- next time dessert first!  All in all a good experience and I love to support the local joints so yay from me!

Babbo's is fast becoming a fave stop for me and my husband especially on Monday and Tuesday when they have their $5.99 spaghetti special!  It is a smaller venue but we usually get there early enough that it is not an issue. Still working our way through the menu but so far everything has been great. They make their own pasta on site and you can def tell the quality. The spaghetti has a bit of heat to it which is a nice change and there are almost always leftovers for lunch the next day! Service hads always been prompt and friendly and overall its just a nice, comfortable joint to go and relax and know you are gonna get some great food consistently. What else can you really ask for?

I work in the Galleria and I really appreciate the staff and selection that Cafe Conmigo offers. They see their customers so often they are on a first name basis with 90% of us and often know our orders before we step up to the counter. For being a small operation they deliver some big flavors- I am especially a fan of their soups which are always fresh and tasty. From getting my morning coffee fix to sneaking away for a cookie or some other sugar burst they are always smiling and helpful. So glad they are in the building but are worth the trip to the Galleria even if you aren't as lucky as me!

Ann is amazing and wonderful and I feel so grateful to have found her and Strut! I am waiting for my dress to come in (should be this week- eek!) and am so excited! Ann made the experience fun and I found a dress I love that I never thought I would find.  In contrast David's bridal called me to cancel the appointment I had set with them weeks earlier then told me I would need to call back in 2 weeks to reschedule- wth? Yeah, luckily I had already been to Strut so I could happily tell them where to shove it.  Ann's is a blessing to Phoenix and I do not use that word lightly. I follow her on FB and she is dedicated to giving back having just participated in a clothing drive for those plus size girls who need appropriate outfits for interviews through a charity and this month she is going green!  I can't say enough great stuff and want to thank Ann for all she does for "us girls" (you know who you are) :)

I found IrisD through Groupon ($15 for $30) and as I am getting married soon I snapped it up. When my friend and I went in we were lucky enough to met Iris herself! She was great and really helped us out and I ended up getting all my wedding "bling" from her. I got a earings and a necklace (set) and a sparkly headband (swarski crystals) to wear on my big day.  The location is a bit out of the way so you have to been looking for it but it is well worth the trip for the expereice, service and selection. I am a big believer in supporting small business and this is def one worth supporting!   Thanks Iris and good luck!!

I miss Pie-Zano's. That was used to be in the spot now occupied by Spasso. I wentt here with high hopes and was very disappointed with the service, the apps and the bill. That being said the entree I had was OK, not great but it was fair (lobster pasta). It was just way too expensive for what you get. Town and Country is struggling and this addition adds nothing the drawing people back. This place  seems like it is trying to be fine dining but it is in a neighborhood joint kinda location. I won't be back here again which is a shame cuz I love to support the local (non-chain) restaurants in central phoenix.

So after reading some other reviews it looks like this place is total hit and miss. My experience was a total miss!   My Financee and I went from Sunday brunch and was suprised at how dark it is inside. I guess when I think diner I think bright and clean. There was a waitress shuffling around that looked like she wanted to cut a bithc and one that was hussling for the whole crew.   My financee got eggs benedict and while the sauce was good everything else was awful and I could only eat 3 bites of my chorizo omelet it was so greasy.   I am tempted to say I will come back and try something else but frankly, they had their on chance to impress me (and I would have loved to add a cool new neighborhood joint to my list of faves) but they failed. I am out.

First let me compliment the customer service here. This is very important as I have recently been experiencing a rash of horrible customer serive so is was such a treat to really be taken care of by the entire staff.   Rebecca was our waitress and we explained that my husband has a food allergy (honey) and she told us right away everything to avoid (turns out the lemonade has honey in it- who knew?) So she was helpful and lifesaving!  I ordered like I was a 5 years old and had the roasted pepper tomato soup and the mac and cheese with pancetta. Ok, perhaps not many 5 years olds would order panchetta but it said to right in the menu (really it does!). It was yummy and I literally wanted to lick the plate of mac and cheese the sauce was so good. My husband has the burger and complimented the very fresh ingredients.  I had to- absolutley had to- have the chocolate covered bacon s'mores. It was deeeelish! Honestly I thought the best part was the whipped peanut butter - the bacon was a great salty/sweet touch but it was the pb that did it for me.   With so many of the dishes containing honey I don't know that this will be a reg spot for us but we very much liked and appreciated our visit and have to say- job well done!!

My husband  and I have been going to see Christine and her team for a couple of months now. We started because of Chris's back problems but I wasn't going to let him have all the fun so I started getting my own massages soon after. Christine, Jessie and Tracy are awesome. They all have wonderful styles and take such great care of us. If you like some of the healing and energy work done they can do that, if you need therapy for specific issues they can do that (and work with your insurance company) and if you just want to pamper yourself cuz you deserve- well that is their favorite (or at least it is mine)!!   I love the downtown/CenPho area and their space is one of the coolest I have seen. It is in the historical district and has a ultra modern loft style look inside. It really is an oasis if peace in the middle of the hectic world of downtown Phoenix.   Love, love, love them and highly recommend everyone check them out!

Overall we had a very disappointing experience here. We had the bad luck to come in after a very big party which clearly they were not ready for or could handle well. We waited nearly an hour before getting our food- now mind you we have a toddler so keeping her calm and entertained for all that time is no small feat. When we finally were served my food was stone cold which tells me it was sitting in the window and no one bothered to run it. I grabbed our waiter and explained the situation and he did offer to remake it but I did not care to wait another hour to get my meal. He explained they got slammed because of the large party which I could almost forgive if the 2 tables on either side of us hadn't  been served and had finished their meals before we got our meal delivered.   **that said the quality of the food was good but clearly it would have been much better hot and if we hadn't had to wait****  The manager did come over and apologize and offered to comp my meal and give us some desserts. I told him that would be great and much appreciated yet 20 mins later we had no check or desserts. We had now hit the 2 hour mark and I should add that I found the metal chairs to be very uncomfortable as I have back issues so I was beyond cranky now. We finally saw the waiter and asked for the desserts to be wrapped up because it was past my daughters bedtime and she was at her limit.   My husband brought us here with high hopes after eating there before but I have to say after the cluster of events we feel victim to it would be hard to give them another try,  PS- The desserts did not stand up to being brought home. The brownie was dry and hard as a rock the next day.
