Burger was not as juicy as other places. It just felt dry. It filled me up but I think that was because the bun was so big.   Good news is that you get an options on fries! Either big fries, skinny fries, or tots.   The place has alot of TV so it's perfect for sports events. I was watching the Boston Marathon bombers being caught so I will never forget it :-)

Great place not just to workout but to hangout with the family on the weekend! They just did a renevation to the upstairs level. Upgrade the Spa as well! Staff is very friendly and the personal trainers know their stuff! But you have to come in a check it out yourself :-)

Pretty cool place to make a quick stop either going or coming from Sedona. It's a nice break for the car engine ( and if you have a baby, super nice break) They have a restaurant that I haven't tried and a bar. A small bakery with some really good goodies.   One day ill try the food to see if I can give it another star to compete the 5. Make a stop, I think you'll like it.

Love coming to this trip. Every time I get visitors from out of state, this becomes one of the destinations. The staff is very friendly and the narrator is super knowledgeable about the area and animals. Come a bit early to get your tickets if you didn't buy them online. The snack and water in the boat is super affordable unlike other boat rides.

By far my favorite mall. It's clean and not run down like Arizona Mills. It has an Apple store and Best Buy outside. And adds a plus star for that :-)  There's valet parking for the super lazy but it's nice to have just in case.   It closes early on Sunday.

This is my second favorite mall! First is San Tan Village. Chandler Fashion Mall is very clean and attracts a different crowed from Arizona Mills. They also have a decent food court. They get s plus for having Best Buy right next store.

Probably my favorite place to get a quick breakfast. It's self server. They have breakfast specials. It's quiet on the weekends unlike other BF place were you have to wait to get seated.

I like it here! Ever since ive become a new home owner, this has been my toy's R us for my home. I also had my first son at the same time, so I've been bringing him here since he was born. I love it that the staff here still remember him everytime. Here you get quicker help than Home Depot where i always have to search for someone.

I should of know but its never going to change. Casinos will always be filled with smokers. But this casinos takes the cake. I mean it hits you hard as soon as you walk in!!! At least in Vegas they have fresh oxygen pumping into the floor. Here you cant even breathe. The hotel in the other hand is awesome! Super clean, friendly staff, nice pool, and good rooms.

Had the lasagna and the wife had the ravioli. Both were great! The meal came with both salad and knots. The location is in a cute area. Staff is friendly. We'll be back!

My second favorite mall in Arizona! I prefer San Tan because it has all of my favorite stores (Best Buy, Dicks, Apple, and American Eagle)  I like Marketplace because it's big and you can just walk around without having to go to the stores. It's pretty at night with the lights and sometimes they have a band playing by D&B.

My favorite mall!! It has all my favorite stores in one place. Apple, Best Buy, and Dicks Sporting goods. The mall is super clean and its all outside which does have its downfall in the summer. This place reminds me of the Grove in California.

Girls here do a pretty good job. I get a zero on my head so i know that doesnt require that much work. They are friendly. I always do the VIP just to get a hot towel on my face during the wash plus an extra shoulder massage at the end. Oh dont forget that you have a 32 inch tv right in front of you during your cut :-)

I'm made it a mission this month to try all the foot massage places in the Chandle area. This was my third location for the month. And what I've noticed that makes these places different is really the noise. This place was a bit quiet than the other places. Meaning, not a lot of talking at the front or staff members coming in and out. The cost is $30 like every other place. The chairs recline like every other place. I did noticed that they use less massage oil at this place... good and bad.   Only thing I didn't like is that they prefer cash. Not a fan since I don't carry any. Probably won't be back because of that reason. Other than that, good place.

The class was super fun and the instructor did great for having a full class. I enjoyed it more than I though I would. We where here for Valentines and we'll be back again for sure.

So unfortunate!! I waited 5 years to come here because I'm from the east coast and in Atlantic city all I did is visit Harrahs so im a regular.   But as soon as I set foot inside the casino... It was an f---ng ashtray!!! The smoke was so bad!! Sooooo disappointed. It took me 45min to get here and I left as soon as I stepped inside. Why can't they make a separate side without smokers?!   Never coming back.

Super happy with this company. I've used them 3 times already! They helped me with my irrigation system and also installed a Rachio system. Very professional. Super friendly. I haven't given 5 stars to a company in awhile because my expectations are usually high but these guys got the job done. Thank you again!

I was pretty excite coming here because of all the great reviews but this must of been a bad day for them. It was a sunday afternoon and only another couple in the place and the food took forever! Also the grilled cheese was a mess. You cant mess up grilled cheese!? Not happy right but will give them another chance again in the future.

For $35 you can get a pretty awesome body massage. It's all done from a reclining couch. They put your feet in hot water while you get your neck, shoulders, and arms massaged. They are usually open for walk-ins. If you want the best, you have to ask for the manager girl. She's my favorite but she's rarely open.

One of my favorite places to go on the weekend. (I wish they were open on Sundays) The place it's pretty clean and the staff is very friendly. I like that they add flavors every month almost. You can also try the toppings! yumyum

Saw the reviews and they all looked great. Unfortunately the wait for just a basic breakfast was over 25 min. I'm guessing that based on reviews that this was a one time event but still happened. For was good.

The place has big rooms and clean. I wished the rooms where a little darker. Other than that the massage was good and i will be returning again.

We went to the 7pm showing and even though it was clean for kids, it was super funny. They know how to put on a great show! We had a blast and will be coming back for sure. Just heads up, they don't serve drinks but you are allowed to bring in small snack and water if you want. Can't wait to see Adult show at 9pm next time.
