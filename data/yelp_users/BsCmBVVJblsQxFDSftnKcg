They have a very small menu. The selection was horrible. The service was even worse. The restaurant was not very busy. However, it took over 10 minutes to get our drink order taken. Our waiter was not very knowledgeable about the menu and was very, very slow in his service. He forgot to bring my cup of soup out. I had to ask for it after our entrees arrived. The soup was cold when I finally got it. The food made me and my friend sick. The only reason that I did not give a one star rating is because the manager was very quick to respond when we asked for one. Then, he took my friend's entree and my soup off of the check. The server and manager were very nice people and very apologetic (especially about us getting sick). I doubt that we will be visiting this location again.

The spice mix that they bring out and mix with olive oil to dip your bread in is simply out of this world. I'm not sure how the do it. But, I can not find the words to describe how fantastic it tastes. The rest of the food was just as good. I have always loved Carraba's when I was living in Kansas City. This location was even better.

This was my first time eating here. The food was very bland and uninspired. However, the drinks were very tasty. Our server was not the worst. But, definitely not the best. However, the manager was excellent. She came and asked how everything was. When I replied that it was just OK, she wanted details. The manager was very appreciative of my feedback and even took my fish tacos off of the check (something I did not expect). Also, they accidentally charged my card too much. The manager that I spoke to was very concerned and understanding. He even went to their accounting department to verify that their records only showed the correct charge. Although my first experience with the food was not great, I am considering giving them another shot thanks to the excellent managers.

I have only ever ordered food for delivery. The people on the phone are always very nice. I have always gotten my food faster than what they tell me. I only gave them four stars because I have to admit that they aren't the best Chinese food that I have ever had. However, they are very consistent and you get great value for your money.

I can't say enough good things about this place. They have the best smoothies, They're food is extraordinary. And the people are the nicest you will ever meet. They are always smiling and are passionate about everything they do and have.  The inside of the store just has this wonderfully relaxed feel to it.... sofas, super comfy overstuffed chairs, fouton, and regular tables/chairs. This is just a super chill place. I always wish I could spend more time there.  On top of that, their prices are amazing. Everything is SOOOO much cheaper than you would find at any other coffee house. And, they have way more than any coffee house could offer.... smoothies (the best I have yet to find in the Phoenix area), daily fresh baked goods, sandwiches, daily dinner selection, beer, wine... the list goes on and on!  They used to just have the drive-thru open 24 hours. But, now, the store is open 24 hours!!! Plus, all of their baked goods are half price after 9PM!! This is one place I think everyone has to experience at least once.

The food here is amazing! As of this writing, I would have to say that it is the best food that I have had in the Phoenix area so far. The prices are very reasonable. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The atmosphere is more like an upscale restaurant than a bar and grill. We have been back several times. Everything that we have tried was truly exemplary. We definitely plan on going back and trying everything else on the menu.
