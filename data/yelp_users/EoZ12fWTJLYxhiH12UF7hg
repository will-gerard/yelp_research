Came to this place on a random yelp find for lunch.  The first thing to mention is if you don't get here before noon good luck finding a parking spot.  You will need to park in the neighborhood and take a nice walk.    Walking in the front door it's a very small and quaint place with a few tables and some booth seating.    We were seated by the door and it was definitely a little warm like some of the tips said.    I ordered the Korean spicy beef.  The portion size was perfect and the flavors were on point.  Just enough spice to make you sweat a little but not burn your mouth off.  The beef was tender and had a good mix of veggies.  Over all great price and portion size for the dish.   I also ordered one of slices of blueberry banana bread which was a perfect finish to the meal.   All in all great place and I will be back for sure.

Normally carls jr has some of the better fast food burgers around but this visit was quite different.  I only live 4 minutes away but when I got home the burger was almost cold.  I ordered a double and got a single, and the patty was super dry and quite tasteless.  The fresh baked bun was the best thing about the burger.

I don't think I can ever buy produce anywhere else.  Sprouts always hands down has the best and freshest selection in town.  They also have an amazing selection of nuts, rice, party mix, and all sorts of goodies you pay by the pound.    You also can't beat their butcher block either.  The selection of sausages and pre made and stuffed chicken breasts is always a great option for dinner and the prices are always really competitive.

Came here after i saw them listed on a top 10 burger list on AZCentral.  I had recently had a disappointing burger experience at The Chuck Box in Tempe the previous week so i was looking for something to hopefully get me out of my burger time blues.  Let me say I was not disappointed.    I went with two other work buddies and we all ended up ordering the Fez Burger all with different kinds of fries.  The combo of everything on that burger was sublime.  the cinnamon pears gave it the perfect addition of some sweetness mixed with the BBQ sauce and the Feta.  The cibatta bread was excellent too.  not too hard and not too soggy.  I ordered the sweet potato fries which had a great cinnamon sugar coating and mixed with whatever awesomeness they included as a dipping sauce was the perfect combo. The server was extremely friendly and we were able to get seated right away during the lunch time rush.  I'm deducting a star for my burger not coming out medium rare, didn't affect the flavor but still a tick mark off of a good burger list.  I will be back for sure to try out some other dishes that looked great as well.

I come here quite often since it's close to work and not too expensive.  I love this place for a couple or reasons.  Consistency and a decent cheese steak.  I'm born and raised in AZ so I don't know what a "true" Philly cheese steak tastes like so for me this place is pretty darn good.  The bread is always nice and soft and the steak is great with the whiz and onions.  Their fries are always perfectly crispy and soft on the inside every time.    They have pizza as well but I don't ever seem to be in a pizza mood when I go here so I've yet to try it.  I'm deducing a star on this because the chairs and tables are in some serious need of replacing and there is a lot of dust on the walls and upper ledges above the booth seating.  I've seen enough episodes of cooking shows to know this isn't acceptable.    Great food though and I will continue to come back!

This is pretty much the only theater I go to.  Yes they have increased the prices a little since it first opened up but it's still cheaper than the over rated Ipic in Scottsdale.    The seats are always super comfy and the food is actually really good.  The food is about average price but the drinks can get pricey.  How can you complain though about getting to eat dinner and have a drink while watching a movie!   One thing to stay away from though are the milkshakes (might as well be ice cream flavored milk) and the burgers I haven't had much luck with as you can't get them cooked to order.  Just about everything else I've tried has been great though.

Finally got a chance to come here after living in the area for a little while.  First off the coupon for checking in on yelp was a nice surprise and second I'm always shocked when a sports bar has above average food.   We ordered the Mac and cheese, the prime rib sliders and the pretzels with cheese and artichoke dip.    The pretzels were super hot and soft.  Not dry at all and they had this great coating of butter and salt.  Probably some of the better pretzels I've had in a while.    The Mac and cheese was really good as well.  Little heavy on the bacon flavor in the cheese but my girlfriend was the only one who didn't like that.  I love bacon and didn't mind it at all. Great dish   Prime rib sliders were great as well.  The only thing I wish was that the prime rib wasn't shredded.  It made it kind of hard to dip the slider in the au jus without losing a bunch of meat in the process.  Great flavor and really soft buns.    Our server was pretty swamped but she was very friendly and kept checking back as often as she could.  We will for sure be back.

Tried to go here for lunch with 3 other coworkers.  We showed up at about 11:45 and the front door was propped wide open welcoming us in.  We stepped inside and the alarm panel by the front door was beeping uncontrollably, it felt like the a/c hadn't been turned on all day inside and there was not a soul to be seen in the entire place.  No customers, no employees, nothing.  We stood in the entry way for a good 5 minutes looking around and walked out.

OMG I have lived on this side of town all of my life and I even went to PV High which is right across the street and I am just now experiencing this place!  what is wrong with me!!  Went here and got a large (which is gigantic) grape with vanilla ice cream and the cream on top.  whole this was devoured and left me wanting to go back the next day.  This is a great little summer treat place to go get something cold to relieve yourself from the 1000 degree days!  I will be back for sure!

This has to be one of the best places around to grab a quick frozen treat.  This location is always busy with families and kids running around.  the amount of kids can sometimes make for a little bit of a wait to select the gelato you want, but it's a small price to pay for the sugary goodness that is Gelato.    I tried the Coconut and chocolate salted caramel.  Both were simply amazing and super creamy.  I have no idea how they incorperate the saltyness into the gelato but when you take a bit you taste every bit of the salt, caramel, chocolate and everything else.  the coconut had real flake of coconut inside and wasn't too sweet at all.  Absolutely love this place!

The staff is always super friendly and the store is always nice and clean.  I even had a situation over Christmas where I was looking for a certain Christmas display and it was sold out everywhere I went.  I made the trip back to the store to pick up the floor model and the manager sought me out in the store to let me know someone just returned an unopened one that he hadn't even out back out on the floor yet.     Great employees and management and I've never had a bad experience.

I've been going to this salon for a little over 5 years now to Leeann my stylist.  I absolutely love her and can say that Distictive is probably one of the best places I've ever had my hair cut.    The staff is always friendly and in a good mood.  They are always having a good time while working and are fun to chat with while I'm waiting or even in my chair getting cut.    Leeann is hands down a super rock star.  She is always on her game and gives me the exact cut that I'm looking for every time.  I love her shoulder massages almost as much as the haircut itself.  She is very informative and is always willing to teach me new things or techniques for me to use at home to get my hair looking like it does when I walk out of the salon.  She's worth every penny no question.    Don't listen to the 1 star review for someone who went to a hair salon to get her nails done and didn't even experience the full service cut and style. Completely unfair to rate this place on that one experience and they don't deserve that 1 star rating at all.

This was my first visit to crust after living in the area for a little over a year.  My girlfriend and I are regulars at MyPie and we thought it was about time we tried out the other store in the family.   We placed an order to go which included an order of garlic knots, penne pesto cream pasta with shrimp and the Mac and cheese with chicken and a cannoli to finish it off.   The Mac and cheese with chicken was quite tasty.  Good flavor and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  It could use a little more sauce though and it seemed to harden in little clumps quite fast but it could be part of the fact it's a baked Mac and cheese.  Still delicious either way though.    The penne with pesto was the best thing of the night.  Seasoned perfect, and the pesto sauce was delicious.  Great all around dish.    The one disappointment were the garlic knots.  We have gotten the garlic knots at MyPie a few times and for some reason every time we order them they we are always hopeful they will be different but they are normally dry and just not what we are expecting.  Well we discovered they are the same garlic knots at crust.  It could just be a personal taste thing with the garlic knots because I know most people rave about them.  To each their own I suppose.   Lastly the cannoli's were a great way to end the meal.  They are quite small though for 1.50 a piece.    We will have to try staying for dinner as the place looked quite quaint and had a great small Italian old school feel.  Definitely recommend this place for some great Italian food at regular joe prices.

So I visited Ipic for the second time since they opened years ago and let me say that after going to the Biltmore AMC suties for the past few years this Theater is no longer a novel concept and completely unimpressive.  Lets start with the price.  i had a giftcard for 50 dollars that I had no used since Christmas and at any other movie theater this would cover the cost of the tickets and might get you a drink or a couple of treats.  Nope.  50 dollars was just enough to cover the cost of 2 tickets on a sunday afternoon showing at 2:15 which is ridiculous in itself, and the fact that Friday and Saturday nights are even more expensive is just stupid.  So we show up to the theater and the first initial experience is very nice.  a front desk person to greet you and print you your tickets and a nice bar atmosphere.    Once inside the movie theater the experience changes though.  the seats are extremely close together and have started to be worn down from so much use over the years.  there was a hard metal bar right in the middle of my back and same for my girlfriend.  the cushion for your elbow was worn down and you can feel the indent from so many other people before you.  When you went to go lay your seat back, it would only recline just slightly, no one near the level of comfort you get from the recliners at AMC.  they also give you no leg room whatsoever in these seats.  if someone next to you wants to get out of their seat the recliner needs to be put back to non reclining mode for the person to move out.  the people sitting behind you practically have their feet hanging over your head as well which i find disgusting.  the table they give you is extremely small and wobbles, barely room for a plate and a drink.  they don't have any other place to set multiple glasses if you get a water and a beer, they also have no place to set the menus other than on the floor if you don't want to be resting your arm on them the whole movie.  the seats that I had didn't have any seats in front of us but in order to recline all the way both me and my girlfriend had to put our feet under a bar and were almost squished against a wall.  On to the next portion of the IPic experience, the food.   Everything is a la carte.  when you order a 15 dollar burger it doesn't even come with fries.  those can be purchased separately for 9 dollars if you would like.  now granted the portion for the 9 dollar fries might be a little larger than you would normally get but that still doesn't excuse the a la carte bullshit for a theater setting.  I ordered the lobster roll for 18 dollars which came with a small portion of potato chips and the roll.  when i received my  meal, the lobster roll came on a bun that was smaller than most hot dog buns and had a very small portion of actual lobster roll filling on it.  the meal was tasty but for 18 dollars it was a complete rip off.  my girlfriend ordered the trio special they had where you got to pick an appetizer, entree and dessert for 26 dollars.  she chose the pretzel sticks, sliders and a brownie ice cream dessert.  while all the food was extremely tasty the portions you got and the prices were almost infuriating.  our bill after tip came to 75 dollars.  if i didn't have a gift card i would have dropped 125 bucks on lunch and a sunday afternoon movie?!!  i could have gone to AMC and paid less than half that and had a great meal, sat in larger much more comfortable seats, have a small light to eat by, a call button for my server instead of having to wait for them to come to us, and actually have leg room when laying my recliner almost flat.   In closing, IPic is a complete waste of money and if you think this place is the best thing since sliced bread you have clearly never been to the AMC suites.  I will never go back to this theater.

I've been to OHSO many times before and normally just go to drink on their awesome patio out back.  Today I went for lunch with a work friend.    We both ordered the same thing actually.  The green chile pulled pork sandwich with fries.    The spice of the green chile was perfect.  Not overwhelming as some green chile can be.  The slaw made a perfect combo on the sandwich and the bun was so soft and tasted like it was made this morning.   Their fries are perfectly crispy with great seasoning.  No ketchup needed with these fries.  I sat at the bar and was taken care of quite nicely by one of the two bartenders they had on staff.  Love this place and will be back for sure!

I absolutely love this little hidden gem.  You walk in the door and you immediately smell the smokey BBQ goodness. The girls at the register are always friendly and greet you with a smile when you walk in.   You can order most of the meat selections in a sandwich form with coleslaw on the sandwich.  I've tried the pulled pork, hot links and the brisket.  The one time I ordered the brisket but it was pretty dry.  Every other time I've come with other people though they swear by the brisket so I might have just gotten a bad batch.    Their Mac and cheese is really good.  I love the green chile mixed with it.  Gives it a nice kick.  I recommend the cornbread also.    If you are looking for a little off the beaten path BBQ joint Astor house is the place hands down.

Ever since this place opened up by my work I have frequented it.  The subs are the perfect lunch size and not expensive at all.   They have a new sub called the clubby that is tasty as all hell.  Ham, turkey, bacon, ranch with lettuce tomato and onion.  All around awesomeness on a bun if you ask me.    Their shakes are bomb diggity too and the selection of bottles soda is amazing.

I've been going to lunch here for quite a while and I think I've only had one bad thing on the menu.  (Stay away from the chicken fingers, super bland)   Hey have an amazing chorizo Mac and cheese, mahi taco, great burgers, prime rib dip, salads and just about anything else has never let me down.  Friendly staff and a nice location.

I normally come here on Wednesdays after I get out of school for their 99cent bean burritos. I've had some decent luck with this location but it's all at complete random chance.  Tonight I ordered a couple of bean burritos and a quesadilla.  When I got home the tortillas were stale and hard as a rock.  You had to peel off half of it because it was just too dry to eat.  I personally think that it's unacceptable for a cook to make multiple burritos and wrap them in tortillas that are obviously meant for the trash can and not for customers.   There are also days when I go here and order the same thing and they are fresh as can be.  Super soft and taste like they were just made.  I don't know what I expect from going to a berto though.  It's always a chance to get really bad food or really good food.    You know you can't call and complain because odds are no one there will care enough to do anything about it or they won't be able to understand English over the phone.

I've been searching for a good sandwich place that delvers for a little while and these folks dropped off a flyer on my door and thought I would give them a shot.    They have really reasonable prices and a decent selection of different entrees and sandwiches.    I places and order from their online coupon area for 22 bucks you get 2 sandwiches any 2 apps and a 2 liter of coke.    We ordered the cheesy philly which was super cheesy and the bread was nice and soft.  We also ordered the steak and cheese fries and onion rings.  I love that even with delivery the onion rings and fries were still nice and crispy.  Nice beer batter on the onion rings and the steak and cheese fries were just what you would expect.  Chunks of diced steak with plenty of whiz.  Fast delivery too.  Great experience and will order from them again.

I love this place so much.  Right next door to one of my fave sushi places and it just makes sense to stop in after dinner.  Super clean. Friendly staff.  Love love love the fact you get to serve your own samples.  Always have a great selection of flavors.  Decently priced too!

I come here pretty frequently as it's within walking distance of my work.  I've never really been a huge fan of Dunkin donuts until I started coming here.  Their donuts are normally always very fresh and soft.  The employees and the managers are very nice and always want to know if you had a good experience.    I normally end up getting a breakfast sandwich and a donut with a oj or iced coffee.  There really isn't much to say other than it's your standard donut shop experience.  The donuts are sometimes awesome and sometimes sub par depending on the level of freshness.  They are no Krispy Kreme that's for sure.

My sister introduced my girlfriend and I to this place a couple months ago and it has quickly become one of our favorite spots.  We love that she can get her own pizza with Alfredo since she's tomato intolerant. I can get my own pie with pizza sauce or their awesome spicy marinara.    The staff is incredible friendly and always has a smile on their face and we have since gotten to know a few of them by name and vice versa.    The cookies are always great and warm.  The concept of picking whatever you want on your pizza for one price is so great let alone the quality being of some of the best pizza I have had.    Now for the true sign of great customer service.  We had an incident with a gift card that was purchased for someone and we spoke to the manager (I'm assuming) bailey and our favorite register guy Timothy.  They took care of the issue for us extremely fast and with a smile.    Bottom line, fantastic people, amazing pizza, great music and extremely affordable.  We hope this place stays around for many more years to come.  Thanks for being awesome guys!

After coming to this place consistently for months now I have to pay tribute to their consistency.  My girlfriend and I come here what seems like at minimum once a week sometimes more.  The pizza is pretty much spot on every single time.  Most of the employees seem to stick around as we haven't seen much if any turn around since we started coming here which says a lot for any type of restaurant.    I am always trying to tell people about this place any chance I get.  I don't think I can ever order a pizza delivery service again because I will always compare it to MYPIE now.    One thing I would love to see them offer though would be maybe a garlic cheese bread mini pizza option or maybe a type of dessert pizza which would be awesome.  Never the less this place will be a weekly stop for about as long as they are open which I hope is a long time.

I am giving my review on today's experience.  Normally on Wednesdays I will get a salad by the pound or go to the Mongolian BBQ area for 8 bucks.  Today I decided to get a sandwich instead.   I chose pretzel bread, a few meats and some other things.  First off the pretzel bread was probably some of the worst and most dry pretzel bread I've ever had.  You want it to be soft hot and a little chewy.  Mine was dry, rock hard, and crumbling all over the place.  Some parts even hurt my mouth when taking a bit it was so jagged and crusty.    The cheese wasn't really melted and in this weird in between phase of cold and melted, the girl put the mayo on the sandwich before she put it on the grill which didn't make any sense to me and I had to specify I would like to add my lettuce, tomatoes and other veggies after it had been heated up.  Other wise she would have put the whole thing on the grill at once?? For the price of it I was extremely unsatisfied and it was the first bit of "bad food" I have gotten from whole foods.  I should probably stick to the things I'm used to next time.

This was my first visit to the gladly and it will not be my last.  I went with some friends from work for lunch and I was quite surprised at how they changed up the place from the old Ruth Chris building.  You are able to walk in with jeans and a tshirt and you don't feel out of place.    I ordered the wagyu burger and fries.  It came out cooked perfectly medium rare and on a fresh baked potato bun with some arugula and grilled onions.  The burger itself you can tell is flavored so it's not just a plain beef patty leaving you to get all the burger flavor from it's toppings.  Super juicy and probably one of the better burgers I've had in a good while.  The fries were great and had a nice salt and pepper coating to go with the home made ketchup.     Some of the menu items can be pricy but the burger with fries was 12 bucks and you pay more than that at zinburger.  Great place and highly recommend to give them a try

I went to Spinato's for the first time with some friends from work who had all been there before and swore by their pizza.  Decided to give it a go and see what all the fuss was about their pizza.  First off the new building they are in is really really nice.  nice and open with skylights galore giving a nice day time feel inside and extremely open.  We ended up splitting a large peperoni and sausage thin crust with a side Cesar.  The pizza came out and it looked awesome.  slightly greasy but being a professional fat guy I tend to get over something like that quite easily.  Their sauce has a great sweet quality about it and the thin crust wasn't too thin but there wasn't a lot of crunch to it which i'm ok with.  I know some thin crust purists would frown upon this but I don't care about them, this is my review!  all in all it was some damn fine pizza and I will for sure be back to here and try out a few other items on their menu.

Ever since this place opened up down the street from me I've been a huge fan.  Their wings are some of the best in town and have some great flavors as well.  The burgers are always awesome and adding pulled pork as a topper makes for a great flavor enhancement.  You can also get your burger cooked to order here and it normally comes out cooked perfectly.  the few times it hasn't come out Med Rare the burger was still super juicy and tasted great so there was no need to send it back.  The one thing I will say about this location though it almost seems like the decor is unfinished.  there is nothing on the walls other than TV's and it just seems empty when you walk in giving you kind of a cold feeling.  I've gotten used to it after coming to this location for a while but it could use some sort of decorations on the wall for sure to make it feel a little more inviting when you first walk in.  The bar is a great place to catch a game except don't expect the sound to be turned on in the bar for the majority of local sports games.  I went in during a Suns game and they would rather play music than the game audio.  I always thought Native was a huge suns supporter but it must be up to the individual location to decide that.    anyway, great food, good service, great location.  I will be back

This was my first visit here and It was a good one.  I started out with the lunch special of two tacos and a soup.  For the tacos I had a crispy fish and a carne asada.  I added the tortilla soup as well.    The carne asada was pretty decent.  I've definitely had better.  It was a little dry and burnt on some pieces but good flavor and just enough spice with the salsa they add.    The crispy fish however was really good.  Great crisp on the breading and the sauces they add give it a great overall taste.  I would for sure get multiples of these again in the future.    Now as for the soup I had it was lacking in a lot of areas.  It came out just slightly over warm temperature which was my first turn off.  I also had next to no chicken in it with mostly broth and a lot of veggies.  Missing something as far seasoning but I couldn't pin point what it was.  I just know I've bad much better at other Mexican restaurants.    All in all a good lunch experience and I will be back to try some other items.
