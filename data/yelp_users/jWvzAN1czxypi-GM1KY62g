As far as wine and cheese bars go - this place has Postino's beat by a long shot.  The wine list is impressive.  The staff can make recommendations on the fly.  The owner actually takes his staff to visit vinyards so they become familiar with the wines.  The food is out of this world - but unpretentious.   You don't have to travel to Scottsdale to get fine food and drink -- we've got it right here in Central Phoenix at Cheuvront.   With that said - try the Macaroni and Cheese - which is what I tried tonight - out of this world, albeit a little spicy.  I've eaten there three times and have yet to try a desert because I'm so stuffed from the fabulous cheese selection and wine.  My new favorite!

China Chili, is quite possibly, one of the best Chinese food resteraunts you'll find in Phoenix.  I've been to a couple of places in the Chinese Cultural Center Plaza (the closest thing to a "China-town" you'll find in Phoenix),  but I still am drawn to China Chili.    There service is fabulous and the food consistent.   We started our meal with a Chinese beer and appetizers (potstickers, and Veggie-rolls).   The orange-chicken meal was fabulous and all the servings are for two, possibly three people (i.e. easily shared).  I also tried the Sweet and Sour Chicken....so tender and yummy.  We never feel rushed or packed in.  We were there on a Friday night and there was a steady stream of customers, but the service or experience did not suffer.    Highly recommend.

Coup Des Tartes is a lovely little gem in the heart of Phoenix. The restaurant itself is an old 1930's farmhouse -- small and quaint. I've read some other reviews that described it as cramped (which I can understand), but my husband and I were placed at a very romantic table in the corner and felt very cozy. This is a beautiful local to celebrate a romantic occasion (my husband took me for New Years eve).   Our highlights were the Brie Brulee and Mushroom Tart (which I don't think is a permanent fixture on the menu). The desserts were to-DIE-for! I swear, I'm still savoring the raspberry chocolate torte. Some day, I want to return for a 3-course dessert-for-dinner meal.   One important note: The restaurant is BYOB. The only self- conscious moment was when I felt neighboring tables giving our wine the once-over.  Given I'm uneducated when it comes to wine selection, I'm hoping my husband selected a "nice" wine from our selection and that we were getting approving looks from those tables...but heck, who cares!  I loved the service, the ambiance and the food!

Yay! I'm a fan. Not an original comment, but it describes my sentiments. I think the place is pretty authentic -- without leaving with a smell of curry.   I love the Tikka Kabab Kandhari (boneless chicken comes out a-la-fajitas-style - sizzling with onions) and I order Nan and a side of the yogurt cucumber sauce. Then I make myself Nan tacos. (I hope I'm not making anyone cringe - but it's great and there's no food better than one you can eat with your hands!)   The location is odd, but I guess, after 3 years of being out here, I'm getting use to restaurants being in strip malls. The price of the food is reasonable - especially for dinner.   I took one of our Australian friends, who had recently moved to the States from London. He loved the food, and was thoroughly engage in a conversation with our waiter about cricket. (I kinda zoned out and watched the Bollywood music videos until they finished.)   Great place. Try it!

Who knew a chocolate croissant could be so hard to find!   I'll always love Au Petit Four because they helped solve my craving - one that I had for three months.  Actually, my husband and I have been back many times - just for desert - and enjoyed every visit.  We met the owner (I think), who happily shared   tips of where to visit outside of Paris. (If they guy wasn't the owner, I don't care because he was charming, French, and made us feel special.)  I want to go back and try an actual meal. But with certainty - it will always be a favorite spot for desert.

Ok...I know I may cause a ruckus with my next musing.... Matt's Big Breakfast or Taylor's Cafe?  Long lines or easy seating?  Crowded, on-top-of -you, loud atmosphere or just loud?  Ordinary food with buzz or ordinary food without the buzz? Easy pick for me -- Taylor's Cafe over Matt's Big Breakfast.    I love breakfast!  I do.  And, more than that, I love comfort food breakfast's -- no foo foo gourmet breakfast for me -- save that for dinner.  I think Taylor's Cafe is just fine.  Plus - they know how to cook "crispy" bacon. You have to ask for it - but it never comes out burnt.  They have interesting omlettes too if you are in the mood.  And you know what?  For a girl who likes a thick stack of french toast - I really like their oatmeal.  Odd, right?  Well it's darn good with fresh fruit on top.      So, while Talyor's Cafe may not have the buzz of a Matt's Big Breakfast - I think the food satisfies my craving and I never have to wait in line.  When the weather gets cooler, go on Sunday, bring your New York Times (sorry-that's the East Coaster in me coming out) and sit out on the patio.  Service is adequate, but not outstanding.  I'm giving my rating to the food and atmosphere.

I know I've previously written a review of Taylor's Cafe, but after another visit this weekend, I wanted to reaffirm my love of their breakfast. In particular, I want to recommend two breakfast entrees.   The blue cheese and caramelized onion omelet and the chicken sausage crepes were both to DIE for! I know these aren't standard breakfast fare, but they are worth a try -- especially if your New Year's resolution is to "start thinking outside the box" or "expanding your horizon's."   But, even if you aren't ready to live the "Vida Loca", still visit this establishment as they have plenty standards to select (I usually go for their oatmeal with fruit and brown sugar) and their coffee, in particular their Latte, is wonderful and is a Phoenix favorite for us and our out of town guest.s alike.

I describe Ranch Market as the Disneyland of Supermarkets.   Seriously, this is not the place to shop too late at night or you'll never get to sleep from all the excitement you just experienced!  The music is loud, the lights bright and festive, and the smell of the food makes your mouth salivate.  I mainly shop here for three things: 1) I always buy my nieces birthday cakes there.  The price is fantastic for a customized cake for kids.  The selection is incredible! 2) If you are familiar with the Mexican baked goods - this place is a one stop shop!  For for a nice change from traditional french bread, try a "bolillo" (a Mexican roll). 3)  Rotisserie Chicken.    But ....just so you know...the produce is great and less costly than Frys.  Two warnings .  First it's difficult to get in and out of the Ranch Market on S. Central on the weekends -- it's VERY VERY CROWDED!  Second, this is an "ethnic" experience.   My husband, a "gringo," has, on occasion, encountered some language barrier challenges, but has always been successful in navigating it. - so don't let it stop you!  The Ranch Market is always on the tour for out-of-town-guests who visit us from the East Coast.  No way would you find an Super Market like this back there -- unless maybe you were in NYC or Miami.

Our family was traveling a route downtown -- one we've taken numerous times down Central Ave from South Phoenix.   I noticed the store front on Central (North of Southern on the East side of Central) and I made a note to check it out since we often travel to Chandler or Downtown Phoenix to get our bikes tuned up or fixed.  My mental note payed off shortly after Christmas.   "Santa" brought our son a new mountain bike for Christmas and my husband put the bike together.   I don't want to seem ungrateful for my husband's efforts, but mechanics is not his forte.  A couple of weeks of riding the new bike and everything started to go haywire - including the brakes and alignment.  We took the bike over to Bob's and he fine-tuned my husbands work.  Note:  Parking is a bit confusing -- you kind of park in a driveway off Central.  I actually considered dropping the rating to 3-stars just because the parking is a pain.  As other's have mentioned, Bob is also a lawn mower mechanic and a locksmith -- he must be handy to have around the home :)   I don't think my husband is quite as ambitious to fix our lawn mower and he will probably be less likely to volunteer to fix anything else after he reads my review....but for the record, I appreciate him and his willingness to fix things....but I'm glad to find backups in South Phoenix if we need them!

I love it when I run into "my people."  In this instance, I'm referring to New Yorkers.  The Fruit Barn is a family run estabishments and the owners are from upstate NY (or mid-State - depending where you are coming from).    The store is kind of like an expanded fruit stand you might find at the side of the road.   The produce is locally grown and they sell a large selection Arizona-only made products (like Honey, dressings,  and nuts) -- stuff you might find at AJ's.  They also have fresh baked breads - off all flavors and varieties.    Bring cash because they have funny credit card/debit card use charges.  This is one of those little  local stores that you need to stop in and support!   With Thanksgiving and Holiday celebrations coming up, you have a great excuse to stop in and check them out!!

Ponderosa Stables has now made it on the "things to do with visitors"  list.   I took my first ride back in January with my husband and 70 year old father in law who was visiting from Connecticut.   And, no, I didn't do it to torture the old guy.  He's a spry 70 year old who runs every day - I took him because I knew he could handle it :)  Ponderosa Stables is at South Mountain Park, the largest city municipal park in the country (by the way).  I live close to the base of South Mountain and have hiked almost all the trails.  Let me tell you - it's a different perspective to be on these trails on a horse.  Wow!  The price seemed reasonable at $30 an hour.  Each time I've gone - it's just been the guide and my small party of 2-3 people.  The horses are capable and calm and you don't get beyond a walking pace.   You get a nice mix of terrain for the 1 hour ride with some downhills and uphills.  But now that I've been a few times - I long for a small trot.  Ponderosa Stables does offer longer rides that can etiher take you out to T-bones for dinner, all the way to the top of South Mountain, and cookouts (which you need a minimum party of 8 people).  The guides are very personable.  Although, I thought it was funny the last time I went thet were short-handed because a guide had failed the random drug test.  It's nice to know that the outfit that runs the place screens for that sort of stuff.  Bottom Line:  Even if you are a native of Phoenix, and have never been on a horse, I recommend this experience.  It really is a different perspective riding the desert on a horse with no name.  (Do you feel a song coming on?)

Oh, I'm a fan.  Ever since we moved out from Washington, DC - three years ago and stumbled on this green oasis in the midst of all the brown.  Anytime I miss the East Coast,  we visit the Farm at South Mountain.  It turns out that The Farm is convenient to us as well.  But I'm happy to know that folks come from all over the Valley to enjoy the ambiance.  We love the breakfast.  YOU HAVE TO TRY THE MONTE CRISTO breakfast sandwich - it's a little slice of heaven (actually it's a huge, gimundo slide of french toast stuffed with an egg, ham, and swiss - except the description is a little fancier than what I've outlined ).  We've been going religiously for three years - almost every weekend when they are open.   The wait staff seems to revolve frequently- which is sad, because I love it when people know my name (it makes me feel special).

South Mountain Park is the largest municipal park in the country.   It's mentioned by National Geographic Magazine as one of the top 5 City hiking destinations in the country http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/trips/best-trails/best-us-hiking-cities/#/phoenix-south-mountain-park_37656_600x450.jpg  Driving into the park from the main entrance on Central Ave allows you to catch any number of trail-heads with access to parking.  One of our favorite trails is the Holbert Trail - takes you through a valley with petroglyphs (easy 1 mile hike RT), but then leads you up one of the most challenging trails up the mountain to the cell-phone towers.   If you have the time, take it - it's worth the travel and the challenge is not the trail itself but more the elevation climb.  My other favorite is the Kawanis trail: This trail is a short 1 mile climb to a ramada where you can catch the National trail (or other trails) for a longer hike.  The trail also provides you glimpses to petroglyphs along the way.    If you want to bring your bikes - there are trails accessible for mountain bikes, but also you can road bike up the mountain (a short ride from the main parking lot) to catch San Juan Rd (close to cars) and allows you a rolling hill ride to the San Juan Lookout ramada.  There are plenty of trails for different abilities and you should check out the trail maps and descriptions so you can plan for your ability level.   Take plenty of water with you always :)  http://phoenix.gov/parks/trails/locations/south/hiking/

This little hole-in-the-wall, located on the southwest corner of 48th Street at Elliot in Ahwatukee, serves the best gyros this side of the Atlantic.   What qualifies me to make such a resounding statement?  My husband and I have been to Greece several times and were married on the island of Corfu (in the Ionian Sea).    If that isn't enough of an endorsement, our friends from Chicago also thought Niro's served the best Gyros -- and Chi-town has the largest congregration of Greeks (hence "Greektown") outside of Greece.  But it isn't just the gyros that rock, I love any of their fried food too -- Mozerella Sticks, Onion Rings, French Fries.   I don't know what kind of oil they use - but the taste is fantastic and they are fried to crispy perfection.  The facility itself is misleading and unimpressive.  If you can get over that, you'll find a tastey gyro winner.  Don't keep driving by - stop in!

The Aji Spa, at the Shereton Wild Horse Pass, has a wonderful setting going for it.  The Spa itself is relaxing and not stuffy.   This Spa can be pricey -- even in the realm of resort Spas - but it doesn't have to be.  Check their Internet specials.  I just took advantage of their Recession Spa package - 25 minute facial, 25 minute massage, 25 minute manacure, 25 minute pedicure , plus lunch is included- all for a weekday price of $199 (weekend prices are $250 for the package).

The service is inconsistent, but the food is always good - so I'm a fan.   To elaborate, the menu is an interesting mix of Tex-mex Americana. They have enchiladas on the menu and right next to it a plain ol' burger!   All their salads are great! And, I'm not a girl who "craves" salads. If I'm going to crave anything it will be peppered french fries. But, man, I crave the z-Tejas Jerk Chicken Salad. Slightly spicy grilled jerk-spiced chicken (spicy and jerked is redundant) with roma tomatoes, feta cheese, tortilla strips (which I omit), salad and a spicy creamy dressing (which I always have them put on the side).  If the description sounds to spicy for you, then try the Pecan Crusted Chicken Spinach Salad as it is awesome as well.   Next time you are out on Ray Road or maybe coming back from Holiday shopping at Chandler Mall, stop by and try Z-Tejas. But for full disclosure, their service could be hit or miss. Ok- I've gotta run....I have a craving....

The secret to a good bagel is the water.  You can't replicate a NYC bagel without the water.  However, the bagels from New York Bagels 'n Bialys come darn close!  I lived in Huntington, Long Island.  My favorite ritual was on Sunday's (in good weather) to grab a New York Times, bagels and cauwfee and spend my morning on the beach.  I wasn't sad to leave Longgggg Island, but I do miss my favorite Bagel shop on Walt Whitman Highway.  (And, by the way, to this day, I still have  bagels shipped to me from H & H Bagels in Manhattan.  Drop me a line and I'll give you the Web address or Google them)  The bagels from New York Bagels 'n Bialys have the right consistency - not too doughy - not too thick.     I say BOO HISS to Chompies and Einstein Bagels.    The bagels from New York Bagels 'n Bialys just might be good enough for me to want to create a new Sunday ritual.  The store ain't no beach, but a New York Times and one of these bagel might be all I need to recreate the experience (and I can always play a Brookstone CD of sea waves crashing).

I don't get it.  Why the fuss or the great reviews?   I've gone to various locations - Phoenix, Tempe, Shea Blvd.  I don't understand why people will wait 30-45 minutes to eat here?  The service isn't bad, the atmosphere is nice.  But honestly, the food isn't that great (IMHO).   I've tried the Turkey Sub, the Chicken Fiesta Salad, the Italian Sausage Sub, the Margarita Pizza and others...nothing has impressed me.  I wonder if people love this place because they serve Cheesecake Factory-like servings (I've always had to take my food home in a doggy-bag).  It's about as faux pizza and Italian food as you can get.   Don't get sucked into the crowd-source mentality of friends raving about this place.   No way am I a fan of the food.  Period.

This place makes me think of the famous line: "I coulda been a contendah." My Florist has so much unfulfilled promise.   You walk in and the hard wood floors and bright airy space make you think you've walked into a truly urban and unique experience. It's exactly what I might have imagined for a downtown restaurant.   We started with an appetizer -- the nachos. This is the highlight of my visit. The nachos are served on pieces of toasted baguette with melted cheese. On the side they serve slices of avocado and the salsa is served in a halved avocado shell. It's an interesting presentation and was very tasty. But this is where my pleasure ended.   For my lunch, I ordered a grilled chicken salad and my friend ordered a Roast Beef sandwich. First, my grilled chicken was not "grilled" and it tasted odd. As a matter of fact, I called the waiter over to ask if some mistake had been made. He admitted that the chicken was prepackaged and heated, not "grilled" fresh.   My friend's roast beef sandwich looked like "old" processed meat - not like real roast beef. The meat on the sandwich had that shiny metallic look (in my mind I'm cringing as I describe it).   I can't believe that a place that has so much potential and uses fresh baked bread from Willow Bakery could skimp out on the food!   Don't be distracted by the big flashy sign and the reviews in travel magazines and local papers that describe this as a "unique" experience. That's ALL this place has going for it ...unique. But if you want good food try someplace else in the neighborhood - like Chevrount's.

I'm still not sure I "get" the whole Chicken and Waffle  as a food combination, but I guess the question is: do I really need to?   I've read that you may have to wait in line. Luckily that has not been the case for us as we've gone on off-peak hours: Wednesday night for dinner around 6pm and a Friday afternoon late lunch (1pm) .   Service has always been pleasant and the meals have come out on a timely basis.  And, hands down, Lo Lo's makes the best waffle...ever.  I think what makes it special is the  touch of Cinnamon.   I ordered the Betty Boop (a chicken breast and a waffle) - definately enough to fill you up.   My husband orders a couple of drum sticks, waffle, fried okra and corn bread.  He can't help himself, his family is from the south and he likes to re-live his youth.  Too bad his metabolism has moved on....

Downtown location has been renovated.  It's gorgeous and roomy but definately seems to have been "Scottsdale-a-fried" (get it?); it just doesnt' seem right that LoLo's downtown location has "Valet parking."   Since this is an update to my original review, I want to call out that I have a new menu favorite:  Stupid Fries -Hot seasoned fries topped with tender fried white meat chicken, gravy & onions, green & red bell peppers covered w/ cheese.  YMTS(f). You MUST Try Stupid fries  Also - if it's a slow day, ask your waiter if the Chef will make you a Chicken Waffle Martini - if the stars are aligned, you will be rewarded with the most unique and delicious martini you have ever tasted.

So happy to find this little gem in our neck of the woods -- but also well worth the trip from anywhere in the Valley.   For those interested in supporting local establishments put this one on your list. It's family owned for over 30 years and the owners live in Laveen. It's easy to get to but a bit tricky to find only because it's located in an industrial area and you think you may have made a wrong turn. The inside is remodeled - clean, friendly, and homey.   Ross and I tried the chorizo and cheese omelet (served with tortillas) because of the Yelp reviews below and we were not disappointed. YUMMY. We also tried a Texas-sized pancake...HUGE....seriously. Next time we hope to try the Chilaquiles!   Awesome service and great food!

The milk is fresh, local, and comes in glass bottles.   Do I really need to go on?  Maybe it is the sense of nostalgia.  Maybe it's the glass bottle.  Maybe it's the fact that I'm getting local milk that is from a local dairy and processed here locally.   Maybe it's the friendly service we get by dropping by the Dairy itself (although you can buy the milk at AJs now too).    I think it's all of the above that makes this milk taste so good.  We are traditionalists in terms of "flavors:" plain or chocolate milk.  But they make many flavors like orange, root beer, strawberry, egg nog (during the holidays at least), and, I taste-tested a "coming soon" mocha-flavor.   We bought a six-pack wire carry case, like the milk-men back and the day use to use to drop off your milk on your door step.  Not that my husband and I are of the age to remember that exactly, we just like the nostalgia.    The milk is more expensive, but the dairy gives you a $2 refund for returned bottles.      If you can't make it to the dairy itself, then pick up a bottle at AJs and do your own taste-test at home against your Fry's/Safe Way/Basha's, Shamrock Farms, or other brand that comes in carton/plastic.  I think you'll taste the difference.  It will be so good, you'll say "AHHHHHHH."

I've read the three reviews from golfer's.  I'm baffled as to why these golfers only rated the course 3-stars.     Golf Digest Magazine rates this course one of the top municipal courses in the country - for play and price.   The course is gorgeous with views of South Mountain - the largest municipal park in the country (a top 5 hiking destination by National Geographic Magazine). .     Golf Digest  rates Aguila Golf Course 4 out of 5 stars - the same rating as The Legacy, The Boulders, and the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Wildfire.   The course is also a PGA qualifier course and hosts many of the State High School Championship tournaments.   Many golfers through out Phoenix travel to this municipal course, not only because of the prestige and challenge but also because it is well-maintained.    The Eagle's Nest Cafe offers spectacular views of South Mountain  The cafe's food is mediocre - which is unfortunate.  I heard that the cafe was going to be outsourced for management so maybe it will improve.     I forgot to mention Aguila provides choices -- a 9-hole course (with pull carts for rent) and the 18-hole with golf carts to rent.  Prices are reasonable: http://phoenix.gov/recreation/rec/facilities/golf/rates/rates18hole/rate18aguila/index.html  If you are coming out to Phoenix for the golf - definitely play your Troon golf courses, but try out the this local municipal course; you'll be rewarded with a great course, spectacular views, and you won't be running into the typical beer-belly, t-shirt wearing amateurs you see on some of the municipal courses throughout the country.  Top local golfers and winter visitors know Aguila is a gem.

This is an intimate bookstore and hard to spot  when your driving down Goldwater. But it's a little gem in the midst of Scottsdale and well worth any frustrations you might encounter enroute to finding it.  I discovered the Poisoned Pen when I read that Gregory Maguire, author of Wicked,  was going to be signing his new book.   FYI -- Mr. Maguire is from Albany, NY - my home town - and we grew up right around the corner from each other and went to the same Catholic school ( although I feel compelled to put on record that I'm 15 years younger).   In a world where Barnes and Noble has become the new public library where folks go to do research, homework or just hang out and talk on their cell phone, it was a surprising and enjoyable experience to come across this little gem of a book store.   The book signing event was hosted by one of the owners and was a potluck supper -- really inspiring a sense of community in a CBSA that rates us as the 5th largest city in the United States.   Look up this store on the Internet and check out their author events. It's really a nice experience (and had the added benefit of making me feel intellectual).

We highly recommend Dr. Patty and her staff at South Point Animal Clinic.  We have taken Winston, our Welsh Terrier, to her for the last 5 years, along with our recently adopted Clementine (a mixed breed dog).   The staff is so attentive and caring.   They follow-up every call and visit to make sure everything is ok.    If we have a question or concern, we call and they advise us over the phone -- which I think demonstrates that they aren't in it to just make a buck.    I love Dr. Patty and wouldn't trade her for the world!

We have been going to Dr. Patty O'Beirn for about 10 years --ever since we moved out to Phoenix with our five year old Welsh Terrier.   Since then, we have added two more dogs to the pack and Dr. Patty and staff love them all (but I think our first born is their favorite).  We live in Laveen and don't find the 20-25 minute drive up Baseline Road inconvenient.   Yes, our part of town has a few Veterinary clinics, but none with the experience of Dr. Patty.   Plus, you get the sense from her that your pets ARE your children.   She will take the time to really answer your questions.  A couple of years ago, when our Welsh Terrier for starting to show signs of aging, she actually let me come in to talk to her about "end of life" care for an aging dog.  She didn't charge me.  She just counceled my husband and I on what to look for and things we should look out for.  We love Dr. Patty O'Beirn and her wonderful and friendly staff.   She and her staff stand out because they are more like the small town veterinarians you see in the movies.  The kind who really KNOW you and your pets and care about you all.

Kiss the Cook?  Shit - they should fire the cook!  I should have known before visiting that I wasn't going to like the place. After all, the AZ Repugnant rated this place as its #2 pick (behind Matt's Big Breakfast) as the top place to have breakfast in the Valley.  As the six friends who read my reviews know, I've never understood the hoopla around Matt's Big Breakfast - it's OK - but geesh -- #1?  What happened to The Farm at South Mountain -- now that's a unique-fantastic-organic-only-can-find-in-Phoenix-Phoenician experience.  Sigh - but I digress...  Ross and I enter "Kiss the Cook".  The interior is special - hard wood floors, mismatched seats and tables -- we both say it reminds us of a country store.  "Nana" is the one who shows us to our seats.  My hopes rise and I start thinking that AZ Republic scored on it's review.  We order.  Service is friendly, coffee was a little weak, but Ross loves the OJ.  Then the food arrives.    The presentation is impressive.  My omelet was TALL!  FLUFFY!  Both Ross and I were wowed!  Then I cut into it and it was runny, soggy, and tepid (not really warm).  The waitress came by, asked how everything was (and she seemed to really mean it versus the polite ask but they don't really care to know the answer question that usually comes from waiters).  I told her about the omelet and she offered for them to recook it.    She came back with my same omelet that must have been thrown in the microwave.  The top was steaming but interior now warmer - but not yet warm.   I picked around the soggy parts and ate the top (that was Ross' suggestion).  The waitress came back again, concerned that I wasn't eating enough.  She was so sweet.  I didn't want to make her feel badly.  But she sent the manager over -- which I thought was very proactive customer service.  The manager (maybe the owner?), stopped by and asked me what I thought might be wrong and offered up that it might be the egg beaters.  She did not offer me something else (but did suggest the next time I go in I should try the Pecan Cinnamon Roll).  And, when we got our bill, the omelet was still on it (they didn't comp my meal).  We paid and no complaint.  I don't expect to be comped, I just thought the experience with the manager was interesting.

My new favorite. Although, I think the food is overpriced and the long lines unbearable. Despite the hype around this restaurant, I think the food and experience deserve the kudos.   My yelp "tag line" is Erika "waits in no line" Keenan. I hate waiting in line. And I don't wait in line. I pride myself in being a person that doesn't get sucked into hype. I guess that's why it took me so long to try the Barrio Cafe.  Don't make the same mistake.   Parenthesis to my review and to help add a little background:  My mother is from Central Mexico (Born in Leon, Juanajuato and raised in Mexico City). She even owned her own Mexican restaurant in upstate New York. This food reminds me very much of what I grew up with -- but adds a twist (I hesitate to call it gourmet-ish) that is what must create the buzz.   The location is not sexy -- which is another reason why I loved the experience. (Not the best reason to choose a restaurant, but one that always adds extra appeal to my decision making process :) The space is small, but I didn't feel confined. The service was not rushed - but everything came out timely.   Richard, the host, informed us that we would have an hour wait.  But it really only took 35 minutes (still a lifetime to someone who doesn't like to wait in lines).    But, I was celebrating my birthday with friends, so I think I was distracted and maybe a little more forgiving.  My party started with the guacamole. They add pomegranates - which I guess is the "gourmet" twist.  Back East, avocados may be more expensive, but out here, no.  Not sure where the $10 price tag comes from - maybe those damn pomegranates.  A nice add - but not necessary.   Since the guac is made fresh at the table, you can always ask to omit the pomagranates, or any of the additional incredients for that matter, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't reduce the cost.  For the main course, I enjoyed the Enchiladas Suizas and my friend enjoyed the Enchiladas de Mole. Both were incredible and I'm confident my mother would approved of the mole. My friend and I both agreed we loved the Enchiladas Suizas best though. (By the way, we had to take part of our meals home and, for the record, the reheated well when we had the leftovers for breakfast this morning.)   I do think the food is a pricey (especially considering what I remember my mother charging in New York for the same dishes -- well ok -- she never served pomegranates in the guacamole).   But, overall I honestly think this is a great place - and I'm so proud Phoenix has someplace that actually services central Mexican food (there's more to Mexico than a double flour tortilla with cheese in the middle or a burrito).   For another Mexican restaurant - without the hype, the gourmet twist, or the price tag, try Tortas la Presa on 24th St.

I went for my first visit to Lux on a Wednesday morning at 8am.  Apparently I'm one of the few who had never been.  The place is packed.   But even with a line, the service was efficient.   Seating is "family style" - you sit a shared tables.  My latte was great and came with a leaf illustrated in the foam.  (Now these barista's deserve a tip jar!)   I ordered a breakfast sandwich and...I couldn't resist...I also tried their cranberry biscotti (I loved it!).  Careful...finding Lux is a bit confusing.   I actually drove by the store-front the first time.   Lux is located NEXT to Paine Bianco and Lux shares their parking lot.

I don't know what Frommers was thinking when they rated this place a *find* -  I think it should have stayed lost.  Ross and I have been trying to eat there for three years.  Every time we tried to stop in we discovered a wait list of an hour and a crowded patio of waiting (read: drunk on margaritas) patrons.    One night our timing was perfect and we got in with a 5 minute wait. I can't imagine what all the hooplah is about that place.  I can only speculate that the folks who are waiting an hour to get a table are so drunk that their tastebuds are numb when they finally get to eat.  I was very underwhelmed. So much so that I don't even want to spend the energy describing what I got to eat (tamales).  What's worse is that I didn't even like the chips in salsa.  Now that's pathetic.  Native and tourists - stay away.

OMG!  Love Chelsea's Kitchen!  Love it.  First, you MUST have the Chicken Nachitos!  The Roasted Chicken Spinach Salad is awesome. This is what I order most of the time because I think it balances the Chicken Nachito pig out that prefaces the main course.  However, the Fish Tacos are great too!  I love hanging out on the Patio.  It's so lovely and the weather is getting nice now to sit outside.  Perfection.  The staff is great and the service is fast but not rushed.  I wish the owners would open up a  place in South Phoenix -- we are "hungry" for  non-chain restaurants!

It's not bad Greek food - it just doesn't deserve any OOH-PAH!s (which in Yelp speak means "this place doesn't deserve any more than three stars").  Not to brag ...but I *know* Greek food.  I've been to Greece twice (once to celebrate the Millennium in Athens and the other was to be married on the Greek island of Corfu on the Ionian Sea).    So again, I say, the food isn't bad.  I get Chicken Soulvaki or Spanikopita and Ross usually orders Moussaka.  If I were to recommend a Greek Restaurant in Phoenix -- please try Greekfest.  Although the name "Greekfest" is almost as cheesey as  "My Big Fat Greek Restaurant, the food is 100x better.   The thing about chains is that you get a consistent experience and you can find them more readily.  So for that, I think  My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is just fine - but it isn't special.

We waited three years to try Quiessence .  Our first visit took place in early September to celebrate our 7 year wedding anniversary.  The previous year we celebrated at the celebrated 5-star restaurant "Marie Elaine's" at the Phoenician (which I think has since closed and turned into a different kind of restaurant).   It is to this that I'm comparing the experience.  The housing is small and intimate and even so, I didn't feel crowded. (I'm imagining folks who have read my other reviews rolling their eyes and saying "yes yes, we know you have space "issues.")  Here's what I loved best about the place: The food was wonderfully normal yet interesting (read: unpretentious -- no venison stew cooked over leaks and served in a copper pan.) The wait staff was knowledgeable and friendly (read: they weren't in tuxedo's with attitudes); and the atmosphere was relaxed (read: There was a live blues guitarist - no elevator music; you can dress up or down; and the food was well timed and not rushed).  I've heard that people complain that Quiessence is too expensive for the experience.  I say PHOOEY!   The food is fresh and organic.  The food selection is interesting and unique.  And the experience is special (read: NOT Scottsdale).     This place is off the beaten path and I'm sorry we waited three years to experience it.  Mea Culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.

My husband and I and some friends stumbled upon Pie Zanos. It was so good, we'll be back. It's a build-your-own-personal-pizza concept: build a pizza from the ground up, including the type of crust you want (wheat or white), type of sauce, cheese, toppings.   It's a great Phoenix experience because they had plenty of tables outside to enjoy the gorgeous winter temps and the other bonus was they served wine and beer as well.   Order inside, and the server will bring your pies out.   We tried the "Greek Pizza" - which was yummy, but not my favorite. I think because the base of the pizza was pesto sauce. I think a garlic olive oil base would have made it better.   The winner of our group's "taste test" was a pizza combo that my friend Michele built. It wasn't a combination I think I would have come up on my own, but it tasted wonderful so I thought I would pass it along: wheat crust, red sauce, spinach, feta cheese, mozzarella cheese, ham, mushrooms, and basil.   Go with a group and share your pizza's and I hope you have as much fun as we did!

I know they are known for their pasties, but the Chicken Tikka Salad is delish!   We've tried the Portabello, The Italian, The Bangers and Mash -- all are yummy.  The staff is always friendly.  We've had opportunity to sit at the bar, at the tables, and at the bar near the kitchen.   It's fun all the way around.

I must be full of love today....  I love this little store and frequent it often.  First of all - it's historic.  It's the oldest continuously operating grocery store in Arizona.  (I'm always looking for fun facts like that.).    I love the "local" flair...Did you know  that you can call them up before you head over and ask if they have what you need?  For example, I forgot to pick up Avocado's at Fryes and didn't want to drive back.  I called Del Monte and asked them if they had Avocados and they said yes.  Very Convenient.  There is also a mailbox on the corner -a convenience considering that the Laveen post office is a nightmare to get in and out of.  If you have visitors who are coming to town, take them to Mystery Castle (near South Mountain) and then drive them down to the Del Monte for an ice cream out of the cooler.  It's fun to see the local cowboys hitch their horse to the hitching post and walk in to get a cool drink - your friends will get a big kick out of the local folklore.  I miss the previous administration and all the plans for renovations.  But at least the Del Monte hasn't lost it's roots in the community and the service is still good.

I love what this place does for the downtown community, including hosting Food Truck events (Wednesday nights and Friday afternoons).   But I also love the vibe of this little grocery store.  My husband loves their BLT sandwich (which is made with Canadian bacon).   Definitely not for the price conscious, but worth the stop for out of the ordinary.

Cesar Chavez Park is located a quick 20 minute drive from downtown Phoenix (up the I-10 exit 35th Ave).    It is a point of pride for South Phoenix as the home of the largest flat-land park in the City of Phoenix.  It has a 22-acre Lake stocked by Arizona Game and Fish four + times a year with Catfish, Trout, and other.  It's an awesome location to host a party - with shaded pavilions, may shade trees, lots of open space, and a playground for little children.  The lake has a 1 mile jogging path around the interior (1 1/2 mile if you also included the path around the island).  On weekends, you can find me walking my two dogs (leashed) around the park.   There is also a boat ramp and I've seen many take their kayaks and mini-sunfish sailboats in.    The park is also home to Aguila Golf course - one of the top municipal golf-courses in the country as rated by Golf Digest Magazine.  As a matter of fact, an online search yielded the same rating 4 as The Boulders, Legacy, and the JW Marriott Desert Ridge.  Some reviews talk about it being trashed or that it is dangerous at night.    I will say, that after main occasions - Mother's Day and Easter and Community Events - the park is a mess.  But otherwise, I don't see huge issues with trash - especially since most parks I visit throughout Phoenix seem to have the same issues with timely trash pickup.   If I see anything out of the ordinary (i.e. graffiti or trash) I report it to the City of Phoenix and by the next day it is taken care of.  Visit this gem. It's awesome!  We are lucky to live close enough to use the park a lot!

My 10-year old Asperger's  Syndrome son has had the great fortune to work with a therapist from Southwest Behavior Health Services. Our therapist is very flexible in terms of meeting at locations that are more convenient to our home. For example, we live in the South Mountain area, so she sets up our appointments closer to home versus the 3rd St. office. Our therapist calls us before every scheduled appointment, not only to confirm the appointment, but also to get updated on our son's activities and life to better leverage life activities in his sessions.   The value of using Southwest Behavioral Health is that they are access to a wide-range of resources and can help pull in resources when necessary.

You can't beat the million dollar view of Phoenix!!!  And if you like steak, then you should give T-Bones Steak House  a go - especialy if you  want an authentic "western" atmosphere and are tired places like Rustler's Roost.    T-Bones serves up cowboy-style steaks or chicken, broiled over mesquite (usually outside on a giant grill).   They also recently added Salmon to the menu.  Other than that - there isn't a very wide selection.  All meals are served with salad bar, cowboy beans and the ever-present bread and butter. But mind you, the all-you-can-eat salad bar is basically lettuce = probably because REAL cowboys and cowgirls don't need a lot of selection (they've learned to appreciate the simple things in life). Side dishes include baked potato, or mashed potatoes.    Choose from beef cuts that include the immense 2-lb. porterhouse or a 'cowgirl'-sized 1-lb. T-bone steak. For the kids, there is a separate menu with choices of a strip steak, chicken or burger.    Don't expect a Ruth Chris' experience.  T-bones is low key -- litterally, cowboys ride up on their horses.  Or police from the academy stop by to have a burger (at least you'll feel safe).  I bring all my friends from out of town to T-Bones Steak House just for the experience.  Plus, have I mentioned the views?  You honestly can't get a better view and a nice steak dinner at a reasonable price.  And it's family friendly!  I give this a "giddy-yup" rating :)

I'm writing this as I eat a leftover slice from a Palermo's pie (aka pizza).  Ummm...yummy.    I love the crust -- the perfect consistency of a Brooklyn pie, but slightly spicier sauce.  For those who like a sweet sauce, this may not be for you.   The  pies are reasonably priced.  The service and eat-in parlor are basic.

Maybe the management is trying to conserve their carbon footprint  - it sure was dark in there.  Ahhh - but I'm burying the lead.    I'm a fan.  Good food that combines interesting flavors - like their Apricot BBQ Chicken Sandwich.  I usually order the same thing -- a shaved chicken pita sandwich (with feta, olives).  I've also tried the Crepes and they were yummy - but I feel like the sauce could have been richer, thicker and tastier.  But don't let that deter you -- it was still great.  The service was good, but I thought the space was a little crammed (...if you read any of my other reviews - I don't like to feel crowded ).   I'm giving the stars to different menu options.  Support your local, stand-alone, restaurants in Central Phoenix!

No longer a fan.  Service is still prompt and friendly.   But there has been a change in the menu that has made me greatly disappointed.    I recently stopped in for lunch, after a 6-month hiatus, to find that two of my favorite sandwiches have changed.  Both the BBQ Apricot Chicken Feta Sandwich and the Spartan Pita both use to be served with shaved Chicken Breast.   Now they are served as a whole chicken fillet.  Couple of things about this new presentation.  First, it's very difficult to eat a pita with chicken that isn't chopped or sliced.   Second, the chicken looked slimmy - like it had been reheated.   When I asked the waiter why the switch (ha ha) from shaved chicken breast to a whole chicken breast, he said the chef said that the meat was now a higher quality and can't be shaved.  Weird answer on many fronts. I mean, really, why would you even admit you weren't always serving quality food?    All I can say is that the chicken looked like it was frozen, spiced, and heated in the microwave.  This coupled with the fact that a pita is very difficult to eat when the chicken is served a la "Burger King" patty versus shaved (or at least chopped).  I use to love Switch for its unique combo of flavors - but in particular for these two sandwich standouts.   Now, I can't bare to ever go back.

I would highly recommend this salon if you are looking for something that is not the typical asian nail shop experience.  Personally, I was forced to seek out an alternative to the asian nail shop, given that I was recently going through chemo treatments, and due to the fact that immune system is low, all the research warned me to be careful about the sanitary practices of nail salons and to avoid those who used the "whirlpool" baths.  As I searched for nail shops online, I came across Sundrops Nail Spot and read all the Yelp reviews.  I know some of the reviews claimed that the shop was pricey, but given my alternatives, I was willing to pay for sanitation/experience.   And, frankly, I felt this was worth it.  A friend and I recently enjoyed a lovely Saturday morning (10am appointment time) for a mani-pedi.    Mind you, I had to wait a week to find availability. Given our experience, I don't think you can just spontaneously decide to visit Sundrops (unless maybe you get lucky).   But an early Saturday morning was so low key - we loved it!  The shop is very cute, with a nail bar to sit at for a manicure, and a lovely row for seats over sinks to soak your feet for the pedicure.   They offer you drinks (tea, lemonade, water).  And they were playing Breakfast at Tiffany's on the big screen TV.    It cost $98 for two mani/pedis.  (probably about $10 more each person than the asian nail shop).  But given that I have to be careful while in treatment, and the lovely experience at this salon, I don't think the cost difference was significant.  The location was convenient for shopping (there is is a Fresh and Easy in the plaza), and for lunching (there is a great pizza place next door, or you can go over to Chelsea's Kitchen for lunch).   I say, do it up:  bring your girlfriends for an pedi-party and then go out to brunch at Chesea's, Postino's or Le Grande Orange!  Try it out!

I feel as righteous about my Cheesesteaks as I do about Bagels. Forefathers has the most awesome Cheesesteaks this side of the Mississippi.   The bread was perfect. The steak flavorful and cooked to perfection (read: not dry). I use to tell everyone that Uncle Sam's had the best Cheesesteaks around. Sorry Uncle Sam's, this place has you beat hands down -- the most genuine you can find outside of South Street in Philadelphia.   The regular is a perfect size unless you are really really really really really (you get the picture) hungry.   You've got to stop in and try this place out! I hope they open a few more locations! (South Phoenix would be great - hint, hint).

I hate strip mall restaurants.  But - I forgive this little place.  Nothing fancy. Very simple.  Very ethnic. So much that the menu is completely in Spanish.  But don't let that scare you ... there are pictures on the menu! Lots of pictures!  I guess they are mainly known for their Tortas (which are sandwiches).  And their tortas are HUGE! And, yummy.  Some combinations are a bit unusual.  I recommend, unless you are REALLY hungry - start with the little sandwich (I like to call them "tortita" - don't quote me - that's my expression and the waiter will NOT understand you).  But my husband and I always get tacos.  He orders Tacos de Alhambra de Res - strip steak with chopped ham and bacon (I think).  I order a cheese quesadilla de maiz (Maiz instead of flour - much better!).  The quesadilla is served with a  green chile salsa sauce inside - spicy - but not to make your eyes water.  You can get quesadillas stuffed with other fillings too.  They have different flavor Horchata's as well  (I love to say Orrrrrrr -CHA-ta).  I'll tell you what....my mom is from Mexico City.  She says that the tacos are like what you can buy on the streets in Mexico (which is a good thing).  I think you should take a chance and trust my mom on this.  She owned a Mexican restaurantt in Upstate NY before Mexican food was "in."    If you read this and do give it a go - let me know what you think!

Since moving to the Valley three years ago, my favorite passtime has become "test-driving" valley Spas.  Revive Spa at the JW Marriot at Desert Ridge has become my favorites.  If you've never had a Table Thai Massage - this needs to move to the top of your New Years Resolution to "Try New Things in 2009."  Revive is one of the few Spas in the valley to offer this treatment (I've also had it at the Phoenician Resort).  You can read  the official description on the Web site: http://spa.jwdesertridgeresort.com/phoenix-day-spa/Spa-Services.asp?service=Massage.     But I describe the massage more like assisted stretching.   You are gently pulled, pushed and kneaded, stretched.  I always leave feeling invigorated - instead of lazy.  You actually wear loose fitting clothing for this.  At $190 for the 80 minute treatment it could be pricey (or in some resorts a great deal).    If you've ever been lucky enough to have a personal trainer stretch you after a workout - that's what this feels like -- only 80 minutes worth.  It's a little heaven on earth.

I enrolled my nine-year old son in this martial arts academy 4 weeks ago.  We go 2x per week.  Everytime I go, my stomach knots in frustration as I watch my son fake his way through the class and not once has an instructor noticed or offered up assistance.   I'm not suprised that an instructor hasn't noticed; there are 25-30 kids (or more) in a class. That number seems like way too many kids in my opinion for the price this place charges.    I've placed a call in hopes that I can line up some 1:1 time with an instructor.  I'll post an update on my star rating based on that conversation.  Stay tuned!

I wanted to update my posting.   Not only was I able to arrange 1:1 time for my son so that he could get some extra coaching, but the owner wrote to me to assure me that they are expanding the facility in order to accomodate the large classes.   In a world where customer service is lacking, I have to give kudos to Lees ATA Marital Arts for their attention to the parents and students satisfaction with their program.   They've been arround for 25 years and I'm guessing this is the secret to their success.   Thanks.

Who knew Asian food could be so much fun. Sens epitomizes all the reasons why you should skip Scottsdale restaurants and just head to downtown Phoenix.   Executive Chef Johnny Chu as created a hip restaurant atmosphere complete with great service (the servers gladly make recommendations and are attentive), a wonderful atmosphere complete with a DJ that plays hip mood music (my husband tipped the DJ just for playing the Selectors, I guess it brought him back to his college days); and the most deliciously creative Asian food on the planet.   To give you and example of the creativity, we tried a spicy tofu and vegetable dish (a chef special of the night) with a decidedly Asian flavor, served with taco chips a-la salsa-like for dipping.   The combination was suprising and delish!  Parking can be found in the rear of the building. If that is full and you have to park on the street, be aware that the meter-natzi is ever vigilant and exercises her/his authority liberally, so feed the damn meter.

Could Nine has become my new "go-to" Spa for a "quickie." Get your mind out of the gutter. I'm referring to facials, pedicures, massage.   NOTE: As you read on, consider that the Holiday's are coming up (whatever "holiday" you celebrate), and a Spa treatment is always a nice gift. But most importantly, the prices at this Salon are cost-effective in our economy, so a $50 or $100 certificate can go a long way.   Cloud Nine has AWESOME prices for services. Check out their Web site for specials: http://www.cloudninespa.com/specials/index.html   Here's the downside: the Spa waiting area is mediocre and pedestrian. Essentially it's a small room with uncomfortable patio furniture. It's difficult to relax when you are crammed into a small place that doesn't allow for the intimate conversation and gossiping that goes along with bringing a friend.   But, like I said, if all you are looking for a quick treatment, you can't go wrong with either the atmosphere or the service. Everyone at Cloud Nine is attentive and friendly (unlike a place like Dolce, which, by the way, I also frequent, but I find the service to be snooty. The aestheticians are professional and knowledgeable and they aren't trying to sell you their product during the service (which makes the experience all the more refreshing).    I recommend going with any of their facials and their pedicures are awesome!  Try it out! And, consider a gift certificate for your spouse or partner as a nice holiday gift . And, no, I don't work for them;  I'm just hoping my husband reads this :)

I've driven by Smeeks many times but never knew what the little store really held, until today, at lunch, a co-worker took me there.  This little gem of a store with old-fashion sweets, treats and goofy novelty items caused me to easily drop $57 on, how I justified it, "stocking stuffers."  I did buy these GORGEOUS handmade, HUGE, candy canes (stuffed with chocolate).   I bought a little plastic camera the squirts water out the flash for my photographer husband's stocking.  And I bought a bunch of fun stickers for my little nieces.  It was a great time!  If you haven't stopped in this little gem of a store, do so.  It's a fun time!  Shop local!

My son and I have been here a few times after going to a movie at the AMC Theatre and we love their pizza -- reasonably prized, HUGE slices, variety of flavers.  The crust is perfect and as close to NY-style as you can get.  They have outdoor seating and they door serve beer and wine if you are so inclined.  I wish they would open a branch downtown -- seems like we are missing a good by-the-slice walk up pizza joint downtown.

We live in Laveen and usually hike South Mountain park.   Today we drove out to Estrella Mountain Park and hiked Rainbow trail, to Dysart trail, to Toothaker for a roundtrip 4.5 mile hike.  I was impressed with the well maintained trails and the trail markers.  I guess when citizens pay $6 per car/$2 to hike in, we all get a nicely maintained park.    Since this was our first visit, we asked for a map and for suggestions on trails for which the attendant highlighted his suggestions.     We look forward to exploring more trails.

My husband and I have brought our son to see both a Pediatric Urologist and a Pediatric Neurologist at Phoenix Children's Hospital, as well as having had services like MRI's conducted at the hospital.   Each experience has been positive - as far as any medical visit could be.   The waits haven't been long.  The staff has been courteous.  The followup has been great.   The facilities are gorgeous.     I would add a couple of opportunities for improvement (which is why there is one star missing from this review).  First, I think that they should add the ability to send email confirmations for appointments.   (In the one instance, the hospital called to schedule an MRI while we were on vacation and I had no way to write down the appointment time.  When I asked if they could send me an email confirmation, they said they weren't set up to do that).   The second opportunity is with the main parking garage.  The security guards were "quizzing" us as to the purpose of our visit.   My husband and I were both perplexed as to the line of questioning.  I think they should coach the security staff to phrase the question better -- especially if it's meant to be helpful.  Other than that, I recommend this hospital, services, and staff to any parent who needs pediatric services.  This is a top notch hospital!!!

Just visited Dr. Berschler's newly opened office in Downtown Phoenix . He recently relocated his offices from New Jersey to Phoenix. He says he's loved Phoenix for a long time, and once his daughter chose ASU for her college education, he decided to pack it up and move.   The office is very convenient for me because it's close to work and live (I work  near Central and Thomas and live in the South Mountain area).. What makes it more convenient is that he offers free parking in the parking garage of the building. Or, if you choose, his offices, at the corner of 1st Ave and W. Monroe is right off the Light Rail line. The offices are modern, convenient at street-level, and the staff was friendly.   Meter parking is also offered right outside his door at street -level- but why pay when you can get parking in the garage of the building for free? :)  The last dentist I visited said I needed a "deep cleaning" which wasn't covered by my insurance. I told Dr. Berschler this and he checked my teeth and said I didn't need something so invasive. That's when I *knew* I liked him.   I've finally found a home with Downtown Phoenix Dental. Check them out!

Anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm a big believer in shopping local. The Spirit Box is owned by a local artist who is talented and attentive to her craft. Her pieces are one of a kind. I would describe them as organic. She can design custom pieces for any occasion. Check her catalog out on Facebook catalog or browse at http://thespiritbox.com. If you sign up to be a fan of the FaceBook page, you'll be privy to private sales. Favorite place both, for those special occasions and holidays!

With quaint accommodations, friendly staff and interesting selection of food choices, I was able to forgive, and forget, that the Centurion didn't yet have a liquor license.   The Centurion is a cozy (and by cozy, I mean small) place. But it has personality and I can imagine myself hanging out on the patio after work - in cooler weather.   For those vegetarians out there, Centurion offers a diverse selection choices. For our lunch, my companion and I split a Heirloom Tomato (with Brie) Panini and the Shitake Spinach Risotto.  Both were flavorful. And the prices are quite reasonable at $8/each.   The menu offers a diverse selection which includes burgers, pizza, pasta, salads (all around $9) and some higher priced dinner entrees (ranging from $23-$42).   I hope to return to try their dinner entrees, the blue cheese crusted filet mignon sounds wonderful!   I feel like I had fallen upon a hidden neighborhood gem. I'm crossing my fingers for their liquor license!

I've been visiting Short Leash Dogs food trucks since...well...forever.  I just realized I never wrote a review.  LOVE LOVE LOVE their dogs.  Who could ever imagine that mango, cilantro, mayonnaise, jalapenos and a hot dog, served on nan bread, would ever go together?  I'm so thankful that Brad and Kat did, because that concoction is one little slice of heavenly dog.      I actually hired Short Leash to cater a party I had at my house for 70 people and it was the talk of all my friends for months after.   I'm pretty certain that Short Leash saw an increase in visitor's the month after my party from all the guest that were introduced to their marvelous food :)  And, I'll tell you what, the price point was so reasonable (never mind the benefit I gained of not having to cook and clean up).  Brad and Kat are great people who care about the community and support the local-organic trend that is sweeping the nation.   Go catch them for dinner on Wednesday evenings (along with other food trucks) down at the Phoenix Public Market, or at Food Truck Friday's same locale.  You won't regret it!

We need a little diversity in South Phoenix.  Seriously, we have a lot of chain restaurants. And a lot of Mexican restaurants. Little of anything else.   So we would welcome a little Italian food into our mix!   Despite my 2-star rating, I do have high hopes for this little Italian establishment and in all fairness, they were only 11-days old on our visit yesterday.   They don't' yet have a liquor license, but you can bring your own bottle and they'll uncork it (for no fee).   One of the servers started us off with a complimentary meat and cheese plate. The problem was, he set it on the table and there was no explanation as to what was on the plate. I also think if they had plated the selections on a smaller plate and added a touch of parsley garnish, it would have been more impressive. As it was, the compliment was more of an eyesore.  The food was mediocre. The dishes were either too flavorful, as in my "zesty" marinara, or unflavorful as in the "God Father" sauce. In either instance, the menu may benefit from some more descriptive adjectives and perhaps some background on the region of Italy the flavors derive; doing so may help manage our expectations.   We did order a desert. We asked if the Canolli was made on-site, and they said it was. But even that, seemed a little blah.   I felt like the place has potential with atmosphere and a sincere owner that wants to deliver a positive experience. But, the waitstaff needs a lot of help and the kitchen needs to work out some of the kinks in flavors.   Give it a chance, but don't go with high expectations.

What a sweet place. I really enjoyed our visit and hope it picks up steam. I loved the menu which includes comfort items like a grilled cheese sandwich and mac and cheese. Both are served just quirky enough to be interesting but not enough to change the "comfort" part.   They serve orders of french fries three different ways. I tried the Parmesan french fries which were served with a marinara-like sauce. I wasn't fan of dipping my french fries in a tomato-base. But I admire that they mix up a traditional serving of french fries.   The atmosphere was fun with a large outdoor patio, an exposed brick exterior, and fun pop music (i.e. our table was singing along to Journey's "Don't Stop Believing'").   This will be a favorite of ours during the winter months of Phoenix. There's also plenty of room for group happy hours. The central-Phoenix location is convenient!   Give it a try!!!

Ross and I moved to Arizona from Arlington, VA. We use to walk to the original Five Guy's burger stand. So, you can imagine our excitement and concern to see Five Guy's become a "chain" and start popping up all over the valley. Frankly, I was worried that quality would suffer.   Five Guys is still exactly how I remember the experience: Long lines, simple burgers, and tons of french fries. It's a great treat and, in my opinion, surpasses In and Out Burgers.  Some tips for visiting:  1. Unless you are a big man or extremely hungry, stick with the "Little Burger" (one patty).  2. ONE small order of Fries should be enough for a table of four. They give you a serving and then they dump an additional serving into the paper bag.  3. Don't visit during lunch hour during the week (anywhere between 11:30 and 1:30) -- the line and wait for a simple burger is outrageous.   We love Five Guy's -- mostly for nostalgia, but also because of the freshness and taste of the burger!!! I think your own experience and opinion will vary depending on how long you have to wait ...it IS after all only a burger.

From the moment we reviewed the menu, we *knew* we were in for a rough evening.   Starting with appetizers, seriously, how can you decide between deep fried deviled eggs, mac and cheese with crispy pancetta, or a grilled cheese pancetta sandwich served on an asiago cheese rolled and roasted red pepper tomato soup?  The answer is: we couldn't and we had to order all three (which, by the way, is tooooooooo much food).  My husband raved over the tender short ribs, served over creamy mashed potatoes, sautéed veggies, red wine reduction!   And, once again, we all had a hard time deciding over the sides and finally settled on ordering one of each:   bacon cheddar biscuits, candied jalapeño orange butter, the wood oven roasted beckett's bacon biscuit stuffing, and the spinach spaetzle, bread crumbs, pancetta (for which I would totally order a full meal of , but that's just me, as my husband and son where not quite as enamored with it).  Dessert, caused us much consternation and we were much more reserved...probably because we were such gluttons from the start.   May I say that if you are a bacon fan, YOU MUST ORDER the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores, caramel,housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter, graham cracker.  Yes, literally it was two huge, thick strips of bacon dipped in dark chocolate - with a side of smores.  Personally, I just at the bacon and let my son eat the smores.    My hubby ordered the chicory coffee crème brûlée - which he enjoyed.  I can't wait to go back with friends!   I heard the owners were going to be opening up another concept restaurant (southern cooking) in the old Beefeaters location.  We look forward to giving that a try!

Don't miss this experience of combination of atmosphere and wonderfully constructed food!  And, guys, don't be put off by the other reviews that say this is a place for the "girls."  If you enjoy a good, unique food experience, this place is it.   Girls and metro sexual men aren't the only ones who can appreciate it!  The atmosphere is cozy and a little misleading in terms of the space.  At first it looks small and cramped.  But the housing is actually spacious with plenty of outdoor seating in front, along the sides of the building, and out in the back.  The interior reminds me of a a little cottage (ok guys, don't lose me....remember the food....food....)  The food is farm fresh and the menu has interesting selections.  Any of their salads are wonderful.  They've got sandwiches too.  But you need to go straight to the AF Classics. My favorite meal is the Wild Mushroom Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart.  My mouth is watering just at the memory.  I wish I had the talent to write about the "innovative" flavors dancing on my palet, blah, blah.  Instead, I just have to say: TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.  I think this a great choice for a couple or for a low key date.

Breakfast is great.  Cost = Reasonable.  Service is usually speedy.  Bloody Mary's are not bad :)   You can get your parking validated so don't be afraid to park in the garage (this is important for those of us who are making the trekk downtown from South Phoenix/Laveen.)  There is a great variety on the menu for even the most picky eaters.

Lovely. Local. Friendly. Fresh.  This is how I would describe the Grove Cafe, which serves a delicious breakfast Sat and Sundays.   This Venue at the Grove is primarily an event venue in a lovely farm-like setting amongst pecan groves.  I was thrilled when they decided to begin serving the greater public and sharing the lovely local with the rest of us schmoes out there.      If you like The Farm at South Mountain, you'll love this place -- less attitude, more attentive service, and the same great quality food.   The owners are often out and about and very friendly.   So friendly in fact, that in a passing conversation we had mentioned that our son's birthday was coming up, and they remembered the next time we saw them.  Frankly, I was pleasantly shocked by that detail :)  The food is fantastic! And, if you live in Central Phoenix, it shouldn't take you more than 20 minutes to get there from the I10 -- super fast.   You won't regret spending the morning (especially in this weather) eating out doors in a quiet green setting.  The food is fantastic.  The chef comes up with wonderful specials -- just last week I had a BLT Omelet (Bacon, Tomato, Cheese and Arugula Salad...stuffed in the omelet).  My son and husband love the Stanley Omelet (Sausage and Cheese), and I'm a huge fan of their oatmeal served with fresh fruit and brown sugar.  And for the record, they missed the 5th star because I'm a coffee snob and really dislike their coffee...but they do make a yummy hot-coco :)  We are frequent visitors so maybe I'll run into you sometime? :)

For the record, I don't give out two stars often.  I'm not a "ranter" by nature.   However, I feel it is my duty to warn the public that this place sucks.   First of all, try calling to get an appointment and you'll see that the average hold time is over 6 minutes -- they answer, then put you on hold.   Second, once you get in for an appointment, assuming you are early or on time, you are waiting in the outside waiting room for a minimum of 20-30 minutes past your appointment time, and then they bring you into the inner sanctum to wait another  15-20 minutes.   I'm not basing this experience on one visit; I am sharing with you the average time I've waited over the course of the last three years.  Why the heck do I stay?  Because, thankfully (knock on wood), I'm seldom sick, and the place ifsclose to where I live.   But after the last experience, which spurred this review, I'm saying ENOUGH - right, like the bad J-Lo movie - ENOUGH!  We have choices in this world and this should not be one of yours.

I really enjoyed this little cafe nestled between Sens and The Turf on 1st St downtown.  Had a yummy Cobb Salad and a side of Sweet Potato french fries for lunch.  I just wish they served the french fries with an interesting sauce (maybe ailoli).  The salad came with along with a chocolate chip cookie for dessert.   The place has great atmosphere (small and quaint).  They have free parking in the back.  Too bad they aren't open for dinner :(

I've read a bunch of the reviews of opening day.   I think that generally speaking, opening day of any establishment is working out the kinks.    With that said, I've visited a few times in the last couple of weeks and any kinks listed seem to have been worked out.  The shop is super-cute and the staff is definitely friendly.   I love the variety of flavors they serve.  They do have a Facebook page and they post the flavors they'll be serving (either the next day or the next week).    They serve flavors like : Mexican Chocolate (with a hint of Cinnamon);  Cherry Cola (with a cherry on top); Snicker-doodle (one of my favorites); Cookie Monster (my son's favorite, but beware your tongue and mouth turn blue); and more!  I think one of the best things about Pixy Cakes is the frosting -- it tastes like Butt-ahh.  In full disclosure, I don't like anything that is too sweet.  Pixy Cake frosting is the right combo for me and you can taste the hint of butter (pure quality!).  I recently called Pixy Cakes for a "girl's night in" party I was hosting.  They made me an assortment of mini-cupcakes which were perfect for us because we got to try different flavors without a lot of guilt :)  The store is located next to the Harkin's movie theater so it's an easy treat before or after a show or even a nice reward for the kids after shopping at Costco.   Give them a try!

My hubby and I have a standing ritual of having Sunday brunch together.  This week we decided to go to the independent standout, on what I call "chain restaurant row" on 7th Ave and McDowell.   And for those who live in South Phoenix/Laveen area, like we do, the trip took us an easy 15 minute drive in Sunday traffic to downtown.  If you are going for Sunday breakfast, being an early riser has it's advantages.  I recommend going between the hours of 8:30 and 10:30 am.  We arrived at 10:15am and witnessed  the place fill up quickly at 10:30am.  We entered the restaurant from the 7th Ave parking lot.  Vovomeena's has an entrance via the patio.   When you enter from the patio, it's a bit confusing orientation.  To the right you will see the kitchen and that's where you start by grabbing a menu off the wall, stand in line, and place/pay your order at the cashier.  They will give you a number and the server brings the food to the table when ready.   I recommend looking over the menu online prior to your visit, because frankly, I imagine this process to be backed up when the place is crowded by the newbies trying to decide what they want to eat -- there isn't much space to move, so the pressure is on.  I noted there were quite a few family with kids.  While my husband and I have a son, we were on a "date brunch" so we chose to sit AWAY from the families :)    I do imagine the patio - during nice whether - to be a perfect spot to have a family breakfast so don't be afraid to bring them along.  But let's get to the food!   Vovomeena's serves up such creative concoctions http://www.vovomeena.com/menu.html  I enjoyed the "Johnnycakes", described  on the menu as two chile corn hotcakes, prickly pear maple syrup, served with a side of  sweet rice, and choice of meat.   Layman translation:  sweet corn tamale (with chile) pancakes, rice pudding, and either bacon or schreiner sausage.   I loved my meal - but was not a fan of the prickly pear maple syrup (so much that my husband was reminded of a scene from the Tom Hanks movie "Big" when he chews and spits out his food.)  On our next visit, I look forward to trying the "Mexican Benedict" , poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, served on sopes.   This is the kind of interesting culinary twists you can expect to see on the menu.  There is plenty on the menu to keep me entertained and no negative experience to be critical of.     Check it out!

This new gem opened in South Phoenix in a plaza on the NE corner of 27th Ave and Baseline Ave.   The store sells a sampling of custom-made olive oils and balsamic with flavors from around the world.   Their olive oil selections include such flavors as Butter Olive Oil (nice to spray on popcorn or sauteing veggies or seafood; Basil olive oil for drizzling on tomatoes, soft cheese and pasta, or my favorite Bacon Olive Oil -- which I've already used to make a turkey panini and used in my dressing for a Spinach Salad.  Their Balsamic Vinegars also come in a variety of flavors:  Cherry Balsamic, Chocolate Balsamic, Mango Balsamic.  I purchased the Chocolate Manderin Balsamic which I used recently for a dessert of slices of pound cake, topped with vanilla bean ice cream and topped with a drizzle of the Chocolate Mandarin Balsamic ...so yummy, if I do say so myself :)     The owners have a sampling/taste-testing bar set up and have big plans to add in specialty food and events.  In addition to appealing to foodies and those who are interested in spicing up their meals, I think the Dipping Well oils and vinegars make for excellent housewarming gifts and holiday gifts.  And the owner, Tangee Wilkes, is happy to pull together a gift basket for really special occasions.  Stop in and check them out -- it's a lovely shop to visit after a hike at South Mountain or a walk through Chinese Gardens down the street (near corner of Baseline and 7th Ave).

My husband brought me here to celebrate my birthday.   He made reservations for 5:30pm on a Sunday night.   It wasn't crowded, but was getting there by the time we left at 7:00pm  Is it wrong start with dessert? The Chocolate Bread Pudding is to-die-for!  A must.  But I digress...  Rusconi's is a large restaurant that feels cozy.   The staff is friendly, attentive, and courteous.     We started our meal with the Shrimp Crab Cakes.   Really it was ONE cake.   But I wish it were two -- it was that good.  My husband ordered the burger, my son the Salmon, and me the Roasted Chicken Salad.   All had excellent portion size and all very satisfying.

I love this little local company's soap, logo and name.....  I mean, common'  who won't go "awe" when they see the little pig and the name "Stinkin' Cute Soap" :)      The products are available online at their Website or at local farmer's market's around town.   All soaps are handcrafted locally, are made of goats milk and  many are Vegan and all-natural, which I love.     The scents are all unique...I recently purchased a couple of flavors like:  Raspberry Lemonade, Strawberry Shortcake (a soap/exfolliant), Creme Brulee, and Grapefruit Margarita (citrus and clean smelling).   I resisted buying the Guiness-flavored soap (yup, it's really made with Guiness beer)...I'm going to hold off for the holidays to get that one for my husband.  The founder of the Stinkin' Cute Soap Company believes in giving back to the community and she created a product called "Save the Tata's"  with a portion going to Breast Cancer Society.  The owner will also make custom soaps and branding for baby showers, wedding showers, and other events.  I was recently at an event for a local school board candidate where Stinkin' Cute Soap Co created small soaps with the candidate's name and logo that were handed out in "goodie bags"!   One product I'm super in love with is their "Solid Lotion Bar" ....yup, lotion in a stick.  It's convenient to carry around this in your purse or glove compartment during our especially dry weather.  It's kind of like a deodorant stick that you rub on your arms or legs and then rub the lotion in.     I believe in supporting local companies, who develop quality product and give back to the community!  Stinkin' Cute Soap Company is one of those!  Check them out online to see their schedule and their products...I only listed a couple of highlights, but they have tons of cute product ideas!

Our intention was to go to Mazie's next door, but there was a 30 minute wait so we decided to give Zookz a try and we are so glad we did!     I'm not exactly sure how to describe their sandwich:  a round panini,? a round grilled cheese sandwich with other stuff in it, or as they say "a warmly toasted, round and sealed sandwich?   However you describe it -- it is fabulous!  My adventurous hubby tried the No. 15 Thinly sliced turkey, dried cranberries, shredded carrots, roasted almonds and a mild curry sauce.   My adventurous 12 year old son tried the No. 45 Fresh Mozzarella, tomatoes, fresh spinach, roasted red peppers and fresh basil with honey Balsamic Vinaigrette.  And, I, probably the least adventurous on this day, ordered the No. 20 Thinly sliced turkey, crisp bacon, fresh avocado, tomatoes, shredded cheddar and Sweet Heat Mustard Sauce ( I was told it was the most popular sandwich ordered).  All three  of us tried each others sandwich by proclaimed our respective sandwich the best.  The sandwiches are served with a little side of Kale salad.    Price point for sandwiches is around $5.75  They do serve breakfast sandwiches as well, which we plan to try!  Operational Notes:  Hopefully you are enticed enough to give them a try, but beware of their hours - M- F 7am - 3:30pm (they aren't open in the evening).  I believe they are closed on Saturdays (that seemed like an odd decision), but they are open on Sunday's (which is the day we happily came across them).   The interior is cute, and they have outdoor patio seating.  Staff is super friendly as noted on other reviews.  No alcohol is served, but who needs the alcohol... will only numb your tastebud's from savoring those flavorful sandwiches!

There is nothing wrong with this place, but nothing particularly redeeming either.  The food was mediocre, and the interior didn't seem to fit the theme.  The servers seemed aloof.   We were there for the lunch buffet which had an ok selection of the Indian standards.  The best part was a never-ending basket of your choice of fresh baked Naan.

Bragg's is located on Grand Ave -- one of the only streets in Phoenix today that has a painted bike lane (not especially relevant to this review, but since I like to bike places when I can, I did make a note of this street feature).    The establishment is located in a triangular/angular building making the layout unique. And the vibe and look reminded me of an old-school "diner."  The service was friendly and educational - especially to those of us who aren't gluten-free, vegetarians, or soy aficionado's.   We went on a Thursday evening around 6:30pm.    I'm not a vegetarian but I play one on TV.   Not really.  I just felt like I had have a disclaimer in place to prove that I came here, not because I have limited food choices, but more so because I wanted to expand my food choices (if that makes sense).     Prior to our first visit, I had never had soyrizo (Chorizo).   I thought it was delicious and have now replaced my chorizo recipes at home with soyrizo.   I'm sure my Mexican-mom would be able to tell the difference, but my hubby and son couldn't so we are good to go on the path to slowly improving our food choices.  Our family agreed that the "Koo Koo Banana pancakes"  won the "best meal award" with an awesome flavor that included rum and brown sugar caramelized bananas.   For those of us who live in South Phoenix/Laveen, Braggs is located a quick 20 minute drive from the south-west side of town.   We will come back.

I decided to try this establishment out on a recommendation from the ChowBella blog for one of the top places to go on a date.    My husband and I tried the sampler platter, moonshine (how could you not), and the potato brisket as an appetizer.  Everything was ok.  But honestly, we've had better BBQ.   It seems to me that Bootleggers is trying hard to make BBQ hip (kind of like Country Music).     The interior was very modern and as was the music playlist.   But overall...I was left unimpressed with the food and the atmosphere.  The service was excellent though :)

We have been here several times.  We love the atmosphere (an old church), the food (a modern twist on Mexican), and the service (friendly).   Try going for Happy Hour (they have them on weekends too) - for a great value.

Breakfast, lunch or dinner - you can't go wrong at this urban relaxed hangout downtown.   It's open -- we've frequently shared benches and tables with other patrons and the location has patio seating.  The Phoenix Public Market Cafe supports local farmers and vendors.  For breakfast - I've had the Devil's Mess - eggs, fresh veggies, chorizo and chiles and the Fresh fruit with Oatmeal and Yogurt.  Both are delishish!    Any of their sandwiches are fatastic as well!  Plenty of free parking available as well!

We are fans of Snooze AM.   We have visited two locations -- one in Phoenix and one in Tempe.   Service and food was consistent between the locations.     My son loves the pancake flights (you can build your own stack).  I love Juan's Tacos.  And my husband is a fan of their Omelettes.      I've read several of the reviews reference the long wait.   One trick to the long wait at this particular location (on Camelback Road) is you can order your meal To Go and they go sit at one of the tables right outside the restaurant (there are a few in front of My Sister's Closet).  The staff is super friendly and always willing to give an opinion on what to get.

I'm so impressed with this facility.  They are courteous, prompt, and professional.  My entire family goes to Dr. Harris Khakwani -- young guy, with a great sense of humor.     To give you and idea, I recently went in for my yearly physical.  He ordered all the standard bloodwork and called me back in to review -- mostly because I'm of the age of qualifying for pre-menauposal systems (tmi for most, but I'm hoping that a) I may never meet most of you; or 2) if you do meet me you'll go "NO WAY she's a woman of that age.  But I digress.   So I return for my blood work review, and he tells me I've got fantastic cholesterol levels etc.  So I tell him "...well that's great, because I work out a lot and try to eat right, and with the amount of time I invest in all my workouts, I should be looking like Julia Roberts."   Dr. Khakwani, without missing a beat, says "Well, your cholesterol looks like Julia Roberts."    Funny guy.   They do have two locations for our convenience, but since I live in Laveen, the location on Baseline works best for me.(623) 251-7559  (Main Number for Both Sites)  1st  Family Medicine 1500 S.Watson Rd Suite 105, Buckeye, AZ 85326 623-266-4012 Fax  3540 East Baseline Rd, Suite 130, Phoenix AZ,85040 480-621-7043 Fax

Dr. Khakwani saved my life.  True Story.  I went in to see Dr. Khakwani with what I thought was a urinary track infection.  The symptoms I experienced were the need to pee every two hours.   He immediately put me on medication but at the same time ordered blood work for diabetes and tumor marker CA-125.  Simultaneously he ordered a pelvic and trans-vaginal ultra sound.   The blood work came back within a week as negative for a tumor.  But the ultra sound showed a growth in my right ovary.  He immediately referred me to an Gynocological-Oncologist who confirmed the growth as a cancerous tumor.  Within two weeks of seeing Dr. Khakwani, I was in surgery.  My cancer is a very rare form of Ovarian Cancer and is usually found in later stages because the symptoms are hard to diagnose.  Thanks to Dr. Khakwani's swift action, I am diagnosed as Stage 1A.    Dr. Khakwani is knowledgeable and is not hesitant to order the necessary tests. He spends the time with you to ask questions, thoroughly explain treatment, and orders the necessary tests.  I feel very lucky to have Dr. Khakwani as my Primary Care Physician.  And I believe that his swift action saved my life!  If this story didn't convince you, I also recommend his office for convenience.  His office is affiliated with the Urgent Care next door.  If you need to visit the Urgent Care and you are his patient, you don't have to fill out any paperwork for the visit.  It's all very streamlined and convenient!

I vacillated between two and three stars and the two won out in part because "Cocktail Parlour" is in their name and I expected way more from the experience and presentation.  We visited on a Saturday evening (8pm).  We sat at a table and this was our first mistake.  I think that I would have had a better experience if I sat at the bar and had a chance to see the "mixologist" at work.     We ordered food -- a cheese plate...lame, and Green Chile Mac and Cheese (added bacon) -- a WINNER.    But my devastation lay in the drinks and the presentation.  While we did not find fault in the taste of the drinks, I felt the presentation was lacking.   None of the drinks we ordered were out of the ordinary -- Chocolate Martini, a Bellini, and the drink of the night.  None came with any fanfare, and yet, tasted like any other Chocolate Martini or Bellini you might have ordered at Lucky Strike or Copper Blues (both located across the street).  They could have rimmed or garnished the Chocolate Martini or created a Chamborde swirl in the Bellini.   Nothing.  My expectation is that if all you serve are cocktails, and, by the way, charge an arm and leg for them, then maybe you should serve them with some fanfare.    Frankly, I would rather go to Fez or Hanny's for my Chocolate Martini.

Definitely a fan of both the food and location.  So happy to have a little Greek food in the heart of mid-town Phoenix.   It's conveniently located across the street from St. Joseph's hospital 1/4 mile from Central Ave.  My husband and I started with the falafel appetizer.  In my opinion, they make the one of the best falafel's I've ever tasted!  Crispy and spicy!    I also ordered the cucumber salad - very refreshing (although I would ask for the sauce on the side next time).  We order Gyros for lunch - the meat was great and the serving is generous.   Oh, and I ordered the Greek fries served with lemon/garlic sauce -- yum, yum.  My only critique is that I prefer my Tziki a little more garlic and thicker than how they serve it at Mika's.  It's set up more like a fast food joint, but everything is made fresh there on the premises and the inside is very nice, but small.   Give it a try if you are in Central Phoenix at an event at the Heard, or an exhibit at the Phoenix Art Museum.  And, lucky you if you work downtown :)

Never.  These people killed my cat last year.  It has taken me a year to actually write this review.   I actually debated whether to write it at all.   But, now, I think it is my obligation to make sure the general public is aware of this business negligence.      I brought in my cat to be spayed.   About an hour after I dropped our cat off, I got a call from the clinic.  My cat had died under anesthesia (before they even operated).  When I came in to pick up my crate, the vet pulled me and my son into a private room.    There they admitted that they didn't run standard blood work prior to the surgery.  This is upsetting, because yes, I guess there is always a risk that your animal may die during surgery.  But the fact that they didn't do routine tests -- not sure why -- upset me greatly.  We have three dogs and I would NEVER trust this outfit with any other animal.   Our animals all go to South Point Animal Clinic at 48th St. and Baseline.   Dr. Patty O'Beirn lives in Laveen.   We trust her 100%   Also, fyi, University Animal Hospital 2500 S Hardy Dr Tempe, AZ 85282  is an awesome facility for emergency visits as well as general checkups.

What I love about PAZ: 1.   The food is fabulous (I'll get into more below, but if you are there for brunch, try the Tres Leches French Toast). 2.  Convenient location and plenty of FREE off-street parking in the lot behind (off 3rd St). 3.   Great service.  Friendly staff.  Good music (although a little loud) 4.   Great community vibe.  The space is open, friendly, with a patio area that includes ping-pong tables, chalk for kids to make side-walk art, and a bean-bag toss.   We have been there on two occasions.  The first was for Sunday Brunch (11:45am) and we had kids with us.   Between us all, we tried the Tortas, the Chilaquiles, and the Tres Leches French Toast - which, by the way, won the prize as the table's favorite.   We also ordered $4 Bloody Mary's and and $11 bottomless Mimosa.  The drink prices left us with the feeling that we time-warped back to 1990's drink prices.  The next time I went was for the $5 Taco and Beer special.   The taco's are street-size (read: not large).  But they are so unique and the combination of flavors are wonderful.    Definitely do the build your own taco platter (that's not what it's called, I just gave it that name) from choices like Chicken Tinga (a slow-cooked chipotle chicken), Carnitas, Carne Asada, Pork Belly (which seems to get rave reviews),  fish and a Nopales   I mentioned earlier that we went with the kids in tow for Brunch.  But the space and owners are dog-friendly as well.  Dogs are welcome on the patio (although we did not see any on either occasion), and they have dog-treats on the ready for your fury friends.  I love how they are building a sense of community with the space and how they are so welcoming.  We look forward to our next visit!

I settled on 2-stars after going back and forth between giving LV Day Spa 2-stars or 3-stars.   In the end a 2-star rating won out because of the inconsistent service I have received.  And for the record, after my last experience (the 2-star rating), I probably won't go back.  In full disclosure, I am not one of the women who is loyal to a particular technician or even a certain Nail Salon.  I get a non-complicated basic manicure and am more about hanging out with my girlfriends for the pedicure.   LV Day Spa offers massages as well.    I typically go someplace based on convenience and need.  The great tragedy of my experiences at LV Day Spa is that this salon is located, quite literally, down the street from my house.  Sigh.  Let me start with the two star service from the managers/owners.    On four different occasions, over the course of the last three months, I have scheduled advanced "appointments" only to end up waiting 20-30 minutes extra to get in.   For a full-time working mother this is frustrating because I really only have an hour to myself.  So the fact that I make an appointment to optimize my time only to have the time disrespected is very frustrating.  On another occasion,  I called early on a Saturday morning to scheduled a massage.   The appointed time was for 2pm.   I was called by the salon at 1:30 to say that their massage therapist cancelled.  This was frustrating because by 1:30pm on a Saturday it was too late to get in to any other location for a massage I sorely needed.   At NONE of these events, did the managers/owners ever offer me a consiliatory offer (next one on us,  a discount on services, a free service).  I did get offered an apology -- each of the FOUR times.     I will miss going to LV Day Spa because they do have great massage therapists.   I've had both Erica and Bobbie.    Both are wonderful and attentative.    However (and I do apologize that there is a "HOWEVER"),   getting a massage in a nail salon is counter productive if you are going for relaxation.   You can hear the noise and laughter from the salon as the massage rooms are right off the main area.  Even if your massage therapist tries to play music, the conflicting jovial comraderie from the main salon comes streaming into the room.  I'm hoping these are growing pains for the business.  But what I experienced was one too many times for me.

We have been here several times, different times of the day, seated both outside and inside and feel like I have enough information for a 360 degree review and for that, I feel a solid 4 stars are deserved.  By far, for me, brunch is my favorite meal at Corduroy with the breakfast sandwich leading my selection:  spicy bacon, over medium eggs, irish cheddar, aioli, raspberry jam, tomato, on country toast.   Wow!    My second choice is always the breakfast tacos: 4 small corn tortillas, scrambled egg, chorizo, potato, feta, fire roasted salsa, side guero beans.   The mornings and early afternoons are still comfortable enough to sit on the patio.     I love Corduroy for happy hour/dinner because their long selection of starters (or what they call "tapas").   Try the Cuban Cigars: 6 crispy wontons w/ ham, pulled pork, gruyere, sweet onion, pickle dijon sauce.    But the Mango Guacamole (I've ordered it twice), comes out like it has not been made fresh to order.   I believe it is made fresh in the kitchen, but both times I've ordered it, the avocado looked slightly brown which led me to believe they made it in batches.     Their list of specilaty cocktails is impressive.   I think my favorite to date is the Bubbling Hibuscus -- it tastes 'fresh' and light - perfect for the heat.   Our server was very impressive in his ability to recommend wines and describe the drinks - asking us back a list of questions regarding our preferences in order to make a recommendation.     Parking, by the way, is plentiful.  And many folks ride their bikes over from the surrounding neighborhoods.    We like the vibe.  I wanted to share one strange event we experienced in making reservations.  On a Friday night, I tried to make a reservation for four on Open Table for 7pm.  Open Table said they were full until 8pm.  I then called Corduroy to see if I could get a reservation.   They also told us they were full, but that I could try stopping by.    We took our chances and stopped by at 7pm and there was plenty of seating and we go in -- patio seating and all.   After the fact, we noted that it was First Friday so maybe Corduroy was expecting a crowd of walk-ins?   The whole experience was odd to me.      I hope your experience is as good as ours has been so far.   And, SWITCH, next door, is always a standup, consistent, option.

We visited Southern Rail on a lovely Phoenix "fall" Sunday morning for brunch.  We sat out on the patio.   It was 10:45am and still relatively quiet.     We started our brunch by sharing the ultimate sticky bun, pecans, icing($5), which was large enough to share a few bites between 4 people.   We loved it.  For my main course, I ordered the fried green tomato benedict, biscuit, tomato jam, creole hollandaise, frisee salad ($13).  The creole hollandaise sauce was not too spicy.  It was definately a favorite at the table!   My son ordered the SR bread pudding french toast, banana caramel bourbon sauce ($11).  Yes, they turned the bread pudding into french toast -- genious! (I'm going to try this out at home.)  Ding. Ding.  Winner.  Our friend ordered the shrimp and grits ($13).  She thought it was delicious, but it was very greasy (as in the oil was pooling to the side of the grits.     I ordered a Bloody Mary, which I promptly gave to my husband.  I think it must be made with "creole" spices and I much prefer a more simpler version with my horse-radish.  Definately consider Southern Rail for an early morning lunch -- it's realtively quite and the menu interesting.  I love the architectural space and decore of Southern Rail -- very open, airy, urban, with lots of outdoor bar and patio space for us to enjoy the good weather we have in Phoenix.  I would definately put this on the top of the list to bring visitors and family members from out of town.  It's a great space for happy hour too.     And bonus:  After Brunch, we stimulated the economy at "Changing Hands Bookstore" located there on the premises.
