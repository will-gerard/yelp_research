There shouldn't even be an option for a star. The service is horrible and bartenders are very rude. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone not even my worst enemy!

I'm pretty disappointed about updating my review because I love this place. I probably come every few weeks with either my husband or with a friend. But the last few times I've been in, I've had bad, unfriendly service. There is one server in particular that I always get terrible service from. I always try to avoid his section, because I go there to enjoy my time and hate how awkward he makes us feel, but I always end up being stuck with him. (He's the older gentleman, shaved head, mustache.) Last Saturday was my final straw with the terrible service from him. I waited at least 15 mins to even get acknowledge, even tho he walked past my table a number of times. I finally order my glass of wine but didn't get my drink until 10-15 mins later, 30 mins to get my glass of wine, really? The place wasn't really busy. I really don't want to stop coming here, but it's getting to the point where I'd rather spend my money at a different wine bar so I can get better service and not feel awkward and ignored by my server. I hope something is done about this.

I have always loved the melting pot, I have been to the Portland, OR and a Seattle, WA locations and have had awesome experiences. Not at this place! I went there for happy hour today, other than my sister and I, there were only 4 other people at the bar and we still got terrible service. The bartender was unfriendly and too busy hanging out with her friends in the corner, talking about their DUI's, so professional. We had planned on staying there for a while, trying the fondue and have some drinks, but because of the service, we left as soon as we could. Never coming back.

I came in with a groupon, and was excited to see what they had to offer since I read good reviews for Gavin. Well, I was so wrong. I came in for a cut and color. Th color was okay, I had to sit with it in my hair for a LONG time while he finished with a different client. Not only that, but he got color all over my face and ruined my shirt with hair dye, which he didn't mention or apologize for. I only realized my shirt was ruined when I got home. Then, when it was time for the cut, SO terrible. He pretty much did the bare minimum and even sat down half way through the cut. I was not impressed and very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

They have great service, and awesome food and drink prices. The staff is very friendly and the environment there is awesome. You feel like you've stepped into a different world. And what makes this place even better is that it's a Duck bar during college football season, GO DUCKS! This is were they Oregon alumni gather to watch games, the bar reserves tables for duck fans and they offer food and drink specials during the games.

I love this place and I love that they have happy hour from 3:00 - 7:00. My husband loves sushi, I do not. So this is the perfect place for the 2 of us. He can go to sushi heaven here and I can enjoy their other delicious options! I highly recommend the pineapple cheese wontons and the ra'king shrimp! The staff is also very friendly and the environment is great. You can either sit inside or outside!

Came here Friday night for date night with my husband and we had a wonderful time. The wait staff were very friendly and helpful with the menu. They have a great menu and their food is delicious! The atmosphere there is very nice  and such a great place to go for a nice dinner with your significant other. I love this place and we will definitely be back for more. They also have a great happy hour in the bar.

This is a fun place to hang out at. They have great service and really good food! They also have a live band playing on Saturday nights.  It's a bar but also a family place, where you can grab a bite to eat with your family.

Came here for the 1st time for a holiday party and we had a great time. They had very friendly staff that were very attentive with our large group. They have awesome steaks and the calimari was amazing. The double black diamond martini is the best!!

I love this location! The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. They go out of their way to assist you and do everything they can to give you an excellent shopping experience. I always feel so welcomed here, which is good and bad because it makes me spend more money! Lol. I love all of their cute clothes and accessories!

I have been on a hunt for a great breakfast place and I finally found Crackers. They have a great breakfast menu from traditional to Mexican and they also offer and awesome lunch menu. The only things I would love to see here are mimosas and longer hours, especially on the weekends, sometimes you crave a sandwich from crackers at 3:30 and you're too late! Other than that, great food and friendly service!

After this visit I remember why I stopped going to Buffalo Wild Wings. The place was clean, the games were on tv, the service was okay, but the food.....spend your money somewhere else! You get more breading than chicken, the wing sizes are terrible and it's just not good period. Also, my husband ordered a Moscow mule, he got a nasty drink in a glass tea cup. WTF. Not impressed and never going back.

Love this place! They have a great variety of frozen yogurt which changes often and a huge selection of toppings. The staff is always friendly, even when we show up 5 mins before closing! :) They also offer a selection of house made treats, like chocolate covered pretzels and such.

So happy I found this salon and even happier that I found Brittany!!  I've gone to about 4 different salons and could never receive the cut I was asking for. But Brittany nailed it! :) She even took the time to teach me how to style my new cut, which I now do to my hair often. I called on a Saturday and was able to get an appointment the same day. I highly recommend Brittany and so glad to have found her!

My husband and I are big fans of this place. The bad reviews posted here are nothing like our experiences here. We are new to the area and have always been treated nicely by all of the staff since day one. The owner is also a very friendly guy and always does his best to accommodate everyone's needs, especially during football season. They have lots of tv's, inside and outside, so you can watch more then one game at a time. They have good food and good drinks. They always have the UFC fight which is awesome! They also have live bands play on Friday nights and karaoke on Saturdays. This is a great neighborhood place to hang out at.

I used to be a big fan of this place but after being a regular, I started to get terrible service by the girls if I wasn't there with my husband. I would visit with another female and we wouldn't even get acknowledged and would have to wait 5-10 mins to even get someone to come to our table and take our drink order. They do have great food but they really need to have more professional waitresses. If your looking for a fun neighborhood sports bar, go further down the street to CK's everyone is so friendly and welcoming there!

This is one of my favorite neighborhood sports bar. They have great food, especially their tukee rub wings, which you can also get the rub on your fries, which is delicious! They have plenty of tvs to watch sports and it's awesome that they always offer the UFC fights, which is hard to find in this area! The owner and the wait staff are always friendly and welcoming!

Dutch bros is the best! I wish there was one closer to home, but I am always willing to make the 10/15 min drive to this location because not only does their coffee rock! The have the best service! The staff is always so friendly and quick! I have never encountered an unfriendly staff member here and they always make you feel so welcomed and often I actually end up driving away with a huge smile on my face and with a much better attitude and it's not because I'm happy with my coffee :-)

I brought my dog in for the 1st time this week and I was berg impressed with their customer service and the grooming services offered. The staff is friendly on the phone and in person. I used to take my dog to Petsmart and would have to pay so much for for the little service I was receiving. At fluffy tails, my dog received a much better groom at a much better price. This is my new go to for my baby

I always come in here hoping for a better experience than the last, but they always disappoint. Yes the food is good but the service is terrible. The staff is never friendly and they make you feel like you are bothering THEM by ordering a meal. I've never had a positive friendly experience in this location, which is sad, because that's what keeps me away.

I love Francesca's and there cute clothing BUT I am not a fan of the customer service at this location. I've been to many different Francesca's, Oregon, California, and here. And this is the 1st location I had a bad experience. I've been to this location many times, and have yet to encounter a nice welcoming person. When I was in last night, I was the only person in the store and was not even acknowledged once. The girls were to busy gossiping to be bothered with a customer. I found a dress that I really liked, but decided not to buy the dress because of how unfriendly the girls were. I can go to the location off Ray road, buy my dress and have a much better experience.

Unfriendly staff and very slow service. Save your money and go somewhere else. 30 mins wait for a roll when it's not even busy is not worth the wait.

This is the best gas station I've ever been to. They have such friendly employees, free vacuums to clean out your car, a car wash, local beers on draft, an Ice-cream station and everything else you could possibly need. They only thing they don't have is liquor, but they have plenary of wine and beer to make up for it.

This is by far my favorite nail salon in the area. I've tried a few other out, and they were not as friendly and as accommodating as this location.  They are always very welcoming and always try their best to get all the walk ins taken care of, no matter how busy they are. They are very attentive when doing your nails, which I really appreciate, because other places just try to get you out as soon as they can. Not here, they take their time and make sure you are satisfied with your service. They have lots of gel nail polish to chose from which is always a plus!

I was excited to try out this salon, because of all of the great reviews. I did see one where their messages were never returned, but I still gave it a try. Unfortunately, I got the same service as the other reviewer, I called (which seems to be the persons cell phone) left a message with my info and asked to schedule an appointment. Never hear back.... Which in the end is for the best because I found a great new salon with great customer service and even better stylist.

Awesome popcorn and great service. We stopped by this location for the 1st time on Saturday and we're very impressed with the popcorn options and the great service we received from the guy working. I asked him to seal the tin we purchased, and since my husband wanted to snack on the popcorn, he gave my husband a small cup of popcorn. It was very sweet!

Stopped in here for the 1st time this weekend and will definitely be coming back. The guys were very sweet and helpful and made sure to give us exactly what we asked for, and they even took the time to educate us on their coffee. I live that their coffee is organic as well as delicious!

I was SO excited for this place to open. I've only been in once, but I was pretty disappointed. The service was great, the inside is good with lots of seating and lots of tv's to watch sports, but the food?? I was not impressed! I first ordered the buffalo chicken bruschetta, we had to send it back because it was so bad (we still had to pay for it when we didn't even eat any of it) I then ordered the steak taquitos, better than the bruschetta but not still not great, it was so bland and boring. My husband ordered the wings, which he enjoyed and said that they were a great size. Next time I'm definitely sticking with be wings!
