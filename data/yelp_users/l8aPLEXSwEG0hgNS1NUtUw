We had my best friend's bridal shower here. The patio is gorgeous and the food is delicious. Staff is great. Ask for Lee or Kayla. They were so helpful, polite and professional.

They weren't pushy at all. I was able to negotiate my payments up front over email which saved a lot of time when I was ready to pick up the car. I had a great experience. Ask for Greg.

I love this place. They tailor all my suits and made my Aladdin Halloween costume. Prices are reasonable, and they have a good turnaround.

Normally I love this place, but tonight was a different story. We came in ten minutes before closing and noticed the TV menus were off. I asked the cashier if they were still open because I didn't want to order and be rude knowing it was close to closing. She rolled her eyes and replied, "Um, I guess." She turns the menus back on since she knew she was trying to close early. I asked what kind of milk they used and the chubby girl making snow acted like we were doing her a disservice by asking about ingredients and replied, "Um it's non-dairy milk." She acted very condescending after we were nothing but polite. When we walked out I was about to say "good night" but the chubby girl rolled her eyes at me because I ordered close to closing. All I ordered were two boba teas. I highly doubt my friends and I will be coming back solely on the principle of their terrible customer service and rude attitude. I understand it was ten minutes before closing, but our orders weren't complicated.

Ask for Christian. He's a great server that's not overbearing. Food and wine are great. Nine Iron and Chicken Salads are my fave.
