I know this place has been there forever. My 21st birthday kegs were procured at this place. However, on a recent visit I was a little disappointed. I parked the sketchy parking lot, walked into the place to be greeted by a dude, that said, 'hey dude'...okay cool. Then as I continued into the cavernous venue, the stench of old stagnant beer wafted into my nostrils with ill content.  How disgusting. As I made my way around the store, I noticed that every beer bottle had dust on them...why? And what the hell is with the individual bottle sales, I understand you can create your own 6 pack...but I can do this anywhere. Also, the individual pricing convention is lame. But my experience didn't end there.... there is a creepy downstairs to this place. I found a brew I was interested in and went home, when I got home I then noticed that my beer was spoiled....rotten....with nasty floating crap in it. I am currently working with Lagunitas to rectify this situation as the bozo I spoke to at the store told me....sorry man...all sales are final.   So yeah, if you want spoiled German beer from the 1930's with labels that look like Ben Franklin printed them....this is your place. My dollars will go to support BevMo or Total Wine.   1 star for being a part of my memory 1 star for somehow surviving in that location.

So we visited this establishment on a nice a lonely night during Christmas break. I did my research on my beloved yelp and should have erred on the side of caution and "followed my guts" instinct.  Upon entry I realized this was going to suck...The lounging around nonchalant hostesses slowly took us to a seat, but it wasn't like rocket science, as there was only one other customer and his lady friend chomping on some food. We ordered our soda drinks which came in some real thin cup type things loaded with ice. Did they not have a fountain machine on site??? Not sure. Moreover, it came time to order.....we ordered our dishes and an app. Let me say that the Kung Pao that I ordered was the worse tasting dish I have ever had at any Chinese food place. Cutting corners aren't ya....With about 3 sticks of chopped celery. And a bunch of peanuts....not even real brown sauce. The app we got sucked as well. I felt like walking out after it appeared as though something suspicious was going on when the hippy looking cook came out to chill with the girls....dude this is not an authentic Chinese food place.  I understand that I am in east Mesa...but for real, panda express serves it much better than this place. I WISH I could get refunded the absurd amount of close to 40 bucks I spent on a family of three......for such little food and such a bunk tasting meal. Heck....I can rock the wok much better. We will never return and I will not have a menu for delivery in my humble home. Anyways caveat emptor....yuck...............

I love this Home Depot! Not too crowded, and yes I have visited at various hours of the day and week. Since moving into my new castle, I have been on a rampage remodeling and painting and fixing things to my standard. Although after spending about 4-5 thousand dollars in 3 weeks, I feel like I should get an award from them.   The place has everything! At least everything I want....except 1 item that I cant find anywhere except for online....it is a 4 Gang wall plate in BLACK!   Oh yeah, and just about everyone there is friendly....wtf?!?! My old Home Depot in Fairfax. VA was full of douche bags compared  these employees. Then again...most people I have encountered out west are generally pretty nice. I love AZ! (and the Home Depot)

I visited this venue looking for quick lunch and a gyro was what was on my mind. I was greeted quickly upon entry to a vacant restaurant. Not sure if this was a good sign or just a slow period of the day. The venue looks nice, was clean, and a little bit confusing. Greek restaurant over powered by Skyy Vodka??? Say what? Moreover, and although a cold mixed drink would have nice....lunch time was my target. Also, I was searching for a nice new venue to visit during my lunch break, etc.  Now here comes the low down.....a 5 dollar lunch menu...sweet! Until I got my gyro and fries....thats where it went down hill. For 5 bucks a gyro should be filled with meat, lettuce and whatever the white sauce was. Instead I got a gyro with 3 - 2 inch long strips of meat....wtf? The fries (which were an additional 99 cents extra) were nice and crispy. That gyro was damn pitiful and for that this place gets 2 stars. Lets get some more meat on them and Ill reconsider....for now consider this to be continued!

Nope...not what I expected from a Thai place!!! I mean if you are into the bland and sorrowful this is your place. If you have never been outside the US and want to impress Suzy Q with some foreign delicacy, this is your place. If you want to eat real thai food...go elsewhere. You don't believe me, i wrote this for a reason! The Pad Thai was disgusting and the soup they gave me was no more than just hot water with carrots, celery, and cilantro mixed in. No traditional Thai spices available. Ill NEVER return!

So far this has been the best Thai food place I have eaten at in Arizona. I ordered the Pad Thai, and to be honest, that was one of the best that I ever had. Everything I tasted that evening was good!   This place is SMALL!!! But do not let that stop you. Go in and try it out.....

Probably the worse subway I have eaten at. The bread on 3 sandwiches we ordered was stale and falling apart. Service was slow and the restroom was scary. I was very disappointed with this visit.  Subway is eaten often, not sure I'll ever come back to this one.

I love going to Papago Park, or as the locals call it, hole in the rock! I started coming here back in 1995. During 1997-1999 I used to just go solo in the mornings and hike up to the hole and watch the sunrise over the valley. I found it quite comforting. I then moved away from AZ a short time later for a 13 year period and was stuck in the DC area.I have recently returned 'home' and took my now 12 year old son to visit, and it still was as awesome as I remembered it. Now I will visit often to spectate and to ride the mountain biking trails I hear they have there.

Rolled up to the drive through with a $50 and was respectfully declined (and this was on a $27 dollar tab)......So I respectfully split and drove away. Get with the times people....debit / credit cards are used by most these.   However, I can not judge the food. I'll return someday, but not going out of my way to do so.

Oh man, this place rocked in all respects to Mexican food! Fili and all the other "bertos" have something to fear!   Simple review: everything tasted fresh, was well portioned, and all in a nice and cozy atmosphere. Oh, and must I say that the red sauces actually tasted like something! I will return on many more occasions.

So I do not usually go out to breakfast, however, this will be my spot from now on. Great food, service and he location was close to home....perfect! My country fried steak and eggs were good, a little smothered in gravy, but still good. I highly suggest this place for an as close to home taste that you can not find at the '$ilver' chains or dennys.....good stuff.

So I decided to venture out around my neighborhood and found this place. Here is my review: Upon entry I knew this would be an odd experience. It looked more like a smoothie place versus a Thai food restaurant. Other than not having proper Thai spices (think fish oil, chilies, etc..) the pad Thai was sub-par at best! My boy got the sweet and sour chicken and was not to happy with the familiar taste of mediocre food! This was a huge disappointment. The Thai Ice Coffee wasn't too good either. And to think about it, the Thai iced tea kinda sucked as well. Over all this was a fake Thai food joint. I will NEVER return to this establishment.

Today was my first time eating here, and I was actually quite satisfied with my entire experience. What really got to me was that I work right up the block from here and have missed this place so many times.   Service: Freakin Awesome! The gal at the counter was personable, friendly, and inviting. Oh and she was in-fact exercising her 2nd, which I don't blame her....the area can be kind of funny/strange/good and bad all at the same time. I had a good deja-vu moment talking to her. :) Thanks!  Food: Holy cow, it tasted like a hamburger! Sometimes I just want a burger that doesn't taste like the people making it are trying to be unique about a product that we all have had. The onion rings were yummy as well.   Environment: The place is called Two Hippies, and this made me feel right at home, although I am not your typical hippie, scenester or whatever..model VW Bugs, Beetles, a great pic of Jerry on the ceiling, Zappa, you name it....music was good too!  I have found a new place to visit when I get to go out and eat for lunch!  I suggest you go and try it.

Food, beer, hotties in skimpy outfits. ...awesome. Irish nachos. ..interesting and tasted good. Drinks were served cold and promptly, which is a good thing. The rest of the food order consisted of calamari which was cooked right, however, a little heavy on the salt. This is for sure a nice pregame location if headed to see a ball game. I shall return. Oh and it's family friendly.

The service is very personable. The shop is small and tight. The food is Damn good for breakfast as there isn't much to eat on or around Mill Ave. at 7 am. They serve a $5 big ass burrito. But my fave is the corned beef...  try it. This is my go to spot away from home for breakfast foods during the daily grind.

We went, we shopped, we eat, we left. I will be back soon...I have that suspect feeling. moreover, there was all that I was looking for. I like this place, however, am going to need to compare this place with other outlets. I'll update my review when I visit next.

Pacino's might be the closest thing in the desert that makes authentic tasting 'Italian' food. I came here for lunch recently with my son and was greeted promptly by the hostess. I ordered a lunch sandwich called the 'grinder' and my son ordered a huge calzone (that Mom finished off that evening for dinner). As an appetizer we had some sort of seafood appetizer which had seared scallops, shrimp, calamari strips, etc....the seared scallops were awesome! f I could just get an order of that.....heaven. Moreover, our dishes were great tasting.  The decor in the venue is nice. a few murals to Al Pacino....which were kinda creepy, however, tasteful. I suspect someone has a thing for Mr. Pacino.....because I saw a guy walking around the place who even looked like Mr. Pacino, however, was NOT him. The venue is nice.   I will return here, however, not for lunch, and perhaps a 'date night' with the Mrs. We will leave the kid at home.   So if you venture off to these parts, do yourself a favor and check this place out.

Fox Cigar in NE Mesa is pretty nice. Very nicely decorated, and the humidor is fantastic. I am not a huge cigar guy, but every now and then like to throw down a nice puff. I liked the selections, and will most likely return again. The guys behind the counter were very friendly and I felt good going inside here. Perhaps my cigar collection will soon match my wine selection.

Okay so I rarely ever give out 5 stars...4 stars is pretty damn good in my book...  I walked in looking to replace my old technology with some new stuff...what I walked out with is the Amigo 50W Mini Sub Kit. So far this is pretty decent, big plumes of smoke...  The customer service was fantastic. Josh answered all my questions and took the time to describe many of their products that they had....I recommend this location to anyone looking for a good vape shop in or around Arcadia.

healthy perhaps, flavor less ... for sure. lower the dance music so we can hear each other when placing an order. I ordered a gyro which was just Damn disgusting. This is the subway of pita joints. As a matter of fact subway is better. I'll consider eating elsewhere. sorry pita pit, but ya suck!

It's typical.... it's a new location. It's really easy to get to from work for lunch. ..I really liked the service and the food was good tasting. If you have ever eaten at any other location you know what to expect. ..I have to visit in a few weeks when is no longer new. ...Look for an update eventually.

This place is right there off of Mill Ave. Let me say....If it lasts 1 year....wow. This place sucked. The service was lame....for example....The manager talking on some stupid headset to her employee who was 10 feet away.   All I had was calamari, it was flat out gross. Lots of fried stuff except for crawfish. I dunno.....As of today I have no plan on ever returning.....  Sad.....I wanted a nice seafood type place in that area....lunch at PF Changs can be crazy sometimes.

First off I'm at the venue and the only madness thus far has been how much I have paid for sub-par Japanese styled food (kyoto bowl is much better than this place).  I'm not sure how to continue this review, other than...I'm not impressed. And for those of you who claim this place is 'amazing' ... I suspect you have no taste buds or are used to eating feces. Lets talk food...I ordered something they called Chicken Katsu...I am familiar with this dish, and I got served was dried out deeply fried chicken. Plus, I had to ask for my side green salad and Katsu sauce, which they neglected to serve with my order. For three people (lunch), $40.44 was a bit enraging. I will never come back to this eatery for all madness sakes.  Just think panda express meets smashburger in east Mesa and serves teriyaki. This place sucks! Save your self the trouble and go to Panda Express or whatever they have at the mall...I actually would like a refund of my cash. Done.
