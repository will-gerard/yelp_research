Not a terrible experience but not an amazing one. I like LAX as my favorite airport. The wifi is speedy and sso are the check ins. San Deigo has a good airport. I didn't check in so I have never waited in line at TSA. I have had this as a stop over ALOT because I've flown US airways a million times.   Its wifi its spotty. It restaurants are over prices for a state that ends in Carolina. Also no place to plug in devices like Phoenix, Salt Lake, and LA. And the seats are CERTAINLY not designed for sleeping.   Ehh.. okay I guess i can't rank the full experience but I assume it never get really busy. for check in and security.

Come on no one has ranked Filberto's yet. THAT'S A DAM SHAME! I used to rock Filberto's BACK in the day on trips to see friends in Arizona. This PLACE WAS BOMB DUDE! You got some BOMB ASS BREAKFAST BURRITOS. Anytime in the day. You got a lot of burrito for your money too. Even living in LA and having been to Mexico a number of times Filbetos is TOP NOTCH Mexican food!
