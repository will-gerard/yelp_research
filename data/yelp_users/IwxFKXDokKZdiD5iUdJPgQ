First of all, this place is awesome. 2nd of all this place is amazing. It is an authentic 50's soda shop / restaraunt. It's so quaint and real! Just ...To. Die. For. I even commented that I felt like I was back in the 50's and should be sitting in the back of the restaraunt. Ahem. I have a pretty sick sense of humor, but one of the waiters did laugh loudly at my sentiment. They have a list of over 50 types of sodas/egg creams, milkshakes. I was in love. I ordered a nectar egg cream and it was to . die. for. Did I mention you get free refills? Holy crap!! They served me the best Pastrami sandwhich I have ever tasted in my life.  and that's just the food. We haven't even mentioned the shopping. Loads and loads of authentic 50's furniture and clothing and other souvenirs for sale. Box purses. All at more than reasonable prices. Some at downright cheap prices.  I mean I was in love, love , love. I told my grandmother, who lives in Michigan, that when she visits me, MacAlpines is the first place I'm taking her in Phoenix.

I like to focus on the positive so let's start there. The hot wings. Get em spicy hot. They were really good. Worth going here for? No  It's a dark bar, my date liked the English vibe of it.  The waitresses were slow (but pleasant) with bringing the drinks and once we did get them the drinks sucked. I ordered a Irish Car Bomb and got less than half a glass of warm Guiness, with the tiniest shot of baileys/whiskey. It was almost undrinkable. Then I ordered the $2.50 drink shot special which tasted like a shot of kool-aid.  We went for the Monday karaoke, and the DJ was good enough but there was this little tv in the corner with the lyrics displayed. I've just been to better karaoke bars (i.e. Ernies)  Like I said my date liked this place, so I guess YMMV. I think I would have liked it more if the service was better and the drinks were up to par.

went here a second time with my regular date "D" on a Friday night.  He likes that place for some reason.   I needed a drink. The female bartender gave me the beer menu and I looked at it like it was a foreign object. "D" said "oh no she won't drink beer, she'll have some kind of mixed drink". So the bartender made me some sweet concoction. It tasted like weak kool-aid. I ordered 2 more different drinks, even the shot of Raspberry Stoli was weak. I asked her to make me a "British Invasion" cocktail and that was faintly good but definitely WEAK. "D": said even his beer wasn't good. I feel like all their drinks are super watered down.   the drinks at George and Dragon are a BIG dissapointment, make a note of it.   However we also ordered food, cause I was starving. Now THAT was good. We got the Cornish Pasty with mashed potatoes and green peas and also chicken fingers with honey mustard sauce. The cornish pasty was DELICIOUS beyond Delicious.    Lots of people were in there and seemed to be enjoying themselves. I just don't see the appeal of the place. Part of my family is from England but maybe I'm just not British enough to appreciate this place.  I'll probably go back for the Cornish Pasty and also cause men actually FLIRTED with me there, and that NEVER happens to me in person. I like being flirted with and whistled at.

The drinks are so weak here that I had to order a vodka shot to put in my vodka martini and a whiskey shot to put in my whiskey sour. It tasted like water before. Any liquor drinks taste like watered down juice. And they aren't cheap drinks, so that's ridiculous. The food is good though.

The steak and lobster is Perfectly seasoned. Yummy. The girls look great, they have a couple of big girls to my delight. The one complaint is the girls could have paid more attention to the customers.

I liked Roscoes, and who can complain about 2-for1 drinks? they played a interesting video mix of music, Lady Gaga, Britney, Madonna, J-Hud some guy stood behind my date and stared at me, it was wierd. I think he might have thought I was a drag queen. "No honey these boobs are real" Other than that, was a comfortable vibe.

It was a good experience, my salesperson Craig, was very knowledgeable. He had me take off my shoes and socks so he could look at my feet and see how I stand and walk. He said I turn my feet to the side when I walk so I needed a specific shoe to correct that. He had me try on three different kinds of shoes and then walk outside while he watched my gait.   He suggested the Asics Gel Foundation.   I like them they are pink, yaay. I wanted a pair of more brighter color shoes but he said I can't have them. LOL   These shoes were $100. I looked online and they are the same price at other places.   Anyway Yall, this is the first time I have EVER bought sneakers that were not Adidas. I am a ADIDAS brand loyalist, but I had to do what was right for my feet.   They have all kinds of sports bras too. So I bought one. It's a little small, just a little, it's a 44DD. I'm a 46F and dropping. I might be a 44F or 44DDD now actually. I don't know, I havent been measured in forever. But it was only $42 and with my discount it came to $36. Half the price of a Enell bra.   So by the checkout counter they have all these energy gels and stuff I've heard about and I asked the cashier, Barry, if I needed that stuff. He said only if I workout for more than 90 minutes at a time, which I DO sometimes. He said after 90 minutes your body starts burning muscle so this energy gel stuff helps to stop that. you're suppose to take it around the 45 minute mark. I bought Honey Stinger and Gu gel products.

This is a fun place, it's huge with multiple bars and games to play. There was a live band the night I went. They also had $5 Tigers Blood margarita specials that tasted really good. I don't know how often those will be around. Try Tweeting your arrival there, you might get a big surprise like I did. Manager tweeted me back and bought me a drink

This was such a good experience I was up all night with a extremely severe painful tooth ache I don't have health insurance so I didn't think I could afford a dentist Friends and Family told me to look up a dental school and thats how I found A.T. Still I called and they said they accept five Emergency patients a day at 1:pm It was 11am but I didn't care I drove straight there and I was the first patient seen at 1p.m. it cost $15 to be seen, $15 for the X-Rays, and turns out my wisdom tooth was infected and had a cavity  so they sent me up to oral surgery, it cost me $85 to get the tooth extracted i was nervous and they talked me through it and calmed my fears It didn't hurt at all, I was numbed up and the student did a good job  they gave me a three prescriptions to take with me and I have to return next week for follow - up the follow up appointment is FREE!  totally recommend this place to any and everyone!

My boyfriend took me here tonight for a belated Valentines day dinner. It's in a nice location. We were seated at a booth. You can see the kitchen preparing the food. We ordered the shortrib flatbread as an appetizer. It came out and it was a nice crusty piece of flatbread with lil bits of meat and carmelized onions on it, very tasty. The server also brought out a basket of warm bread with a side of oil and herbs. That was good as well. My boyfriend ordered a large 9 ounce blackberry sangria. I didn't think it was that large when it came out especially for the price of $12, however it tasted really good and sweet. More like juice than sangria though. After we ate our appetizer we ordered our meals. I ordered the Seafood Cannelloni with a chicken soup. My boyfriend ordered Lobster ravioli with a ceasar salad. When the soup came out I realized I wasn't in the mood for soup so I swapped with my boyfriend. My boyfriend thought the soup was a little too salty. The caesar salad was delicious although I personally think iceberg lettuce should be banned in restaraunt salads. It is nutritionally void. our entrees came out after we finished our soup and salad. The server added lots of cheese on top, Yum. My dish was delicious with good chunks of seafood in it and I tasted my boyfriends lobster ravioli and that was good too. We ate half our food and took the rest in a to go box. I enjoyed my meal at Carrabbas.

Went to the Phx Art Museum for the first time. It was First Friday so it was free to check out the museum.   A woman stopped us inside and said she was giving a tour at 6:30 of the Theatre De La Mode ( http://www.phxart.org/fashion/ ), so we gathered around her and she was quite knowledgeable and had good information. She told us alot of history of Paris haute couture. The exhibit was exquisite, I wanted to touch the fashions so bad like a little kid. But they had an alarm around it.There were beautiful gorgeous hand made gowns and dresses by people like Balenciaga and other designers from the post-World War II France era.  After showing us that exhibit , the tour guide also showed us the South Wing of the museum and some other interesting art installations.   I want to go back to the Phx Art Museum. It's a large museum and there is no way to see the entire thing in one visit, they have some great, curiously interesting pieces with facinating backgrounds.  There was a cuban band playing in the museum on this night,after the tour we all gathered near the band and just danced a bit while having drinks.

I was craving chicken and waffles aso I decided to try the phoenix location of LoLo's. This location seems bigger and nicer decor. I like the floors. I went around 10:30 am on a weekday. I ordered chicken breast, waffle and cheesy grits. It came out really fast and it was delicious

This is a Mexican restaraunt, I went there for a meetup.com event. I was not impressed with the atmosphere, service or food. the seating is too close together and uncomrtable.  The food was bland. The service was not very profesional. My frozen strawberry frozen margarita tasted like a fruit smoothie with no alcohol. The only bright spot was the outdoor area with the authentic mexixan tiled steps, which I took a picture on. This place is a dud. I will not return.

"D" took me here last week, gonna make this quick atmosphere was old fashioned mom and pop restaraunt waitress was friendly and quick he ordered a draft beer and it came in the smallest glass ever I ordered the country fried steak dinner, with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob and a trip to the salad bar. Their homemade blue cheese dressing is enough to return to this place for. The country fried steak and mashed potatoes both automatically came with some creamy white gravy on it. When I tasted it,  I could tell it had bacon fat in it, and I dont eat pork, but to be honest, i couldn't stop eating my food, it was sooo good.  If you go here I do recommend the country fried steak, but if you don't eat pork, order it wihout gravy.

I ordered my Lenny's bbq burger over the phone and was told it would be ready within 10 minutes. I arrived about 15 minutes later and the cashier couldn't find my burger.  Turns out I ordered from the wrong location. There's a Lenny's Burger SHOP also on Glendale Avenue that I mistakenly ordered from. Confusing! This was my first time at Lenny's so I didn't know all the options they had on the menu. I saw a picture of the Mexican burger and decided to get that instead. It was ready within 2 minutes. It's a cute place so I decided to eat in. This burger was delicious with, yummy grilled onions, sliced green chilli's and  ranch saunce and the fries were big and I couldn't even eat all mine.  Also for such a delicious burger they are well priced, my combo was $6, almost the same price as a fast food joint but this food tastes better. Lenny, the restaraunts namesake, was there and greeting people. He was really nice, there were two other people who had order issues and he took care of them right away. He said that since they've moved to the new location it's been overwhelmingly busy. So perhaps that's why there were order issues. They are still working out the kinks. I'd return here with frirends.

I went to Arizona Nail Technology school to get a manicure and pedicure before my dinner date. The ONLY reason I went to that business specifically is because GROUPON says if I spend $100 there I will get REWARDS and I want to know what my rewards are. This groupon stuff has made me nutty. Anyway so it's not a luxurious spa, its a kinda rinky dink school. they don't have massage pedicure chairs which I love at most nail places. theres just some couches and they bring over tubs with water in them to soak your feet in. My nail tech student was awesome though. She pampered my feet so well, she scrubbed them and massaged them , I added on the $5 paraffin wax treatment to make my feet even softer since it's been about 6 months since Ive had a pedicure and my feet were looking rough. I chose a beautiful bright red polish.  After over an hour of her doing my feet, we went to the nail bar and I asked for shellac nails since I was curious about that but she used something called Gelish Soak-off Gel polish. Gelish stays on nails for three weeks with no chipping or peeling, and soak completely off in only 15 minutes. I chose a french manicure with that product using my natural nails no tips, no acrylic. I LOVE the result even though it took like 3 hours to complete. The total for my mani/pedi was $55 including tip. I don't know if or when I will ever be able to afford to go back but I do want to reach $100 there so I can get my GROUPON Rewards. LOL

Really hot chicks, with nipple covers. ok, I've never discussed this one problem that I have  which is called strippers  I don't frequent strip clubs because I have a stripper problem  I would say my Stripper issue is similiar to a gamblers issue in casino. No will power. I want them all, I put all my money down.  Strippers can have all my money. It's been this way forever. This is why I don't go to strip clubs often.  I drain my bank account, even if it's the last $10 I have, to spend. I could be saving money for a heart operation and if you take me in a strip club, that's it. Over.   Tonight We went to Skin Cabaret  and I lost my mind, soul, and pennies  I don't think my male counterpart could keep up with me in there  The way they shake their asses ......  First of all I am a completely heterosexual, non bisexual, female second of all , my attraction to strippers is similiar to the average dirty old man in America  I like them blonde, skinny, small waists with huge fake tits   for some reason we couldn't get the stripper I wanted to come over, she was fake blonde hair, fake big tits, fake face. i asked for her twice and even our waitress asked her to come over, but she kept saying she was too busy with her friends and would come over later  Sigh. Oh well   so I got 4 lap dances from 4 other girls until I found "the ONE"  this girl named Cameron  she was sooo sexy   she exuded sensuality and sex from her pores, her eyes were the epitome of "fuck me " eyes  her body was sooo sexy, small waist, nice ass, big huge fake tits, she had dark hair, she looked a lil middle eastern but she says she's Sicilian  Me and my male friend both got TWO lap dances from her each I said "that's it, we don't even need to see anyone else after her, she is IT"  If I wasnt dragged out of there, I would still be getting lap dances from her right now  She almost made me a LESBO  My male lover told her she was turning his girlfriend bi, lol  I recommend her to every guy and girl who visits arizona  Cameron at Skin Caberet in Scottsdale  lap dances are $10, but i usually gave $35  hence why I shouldn't frequent strip clubs  I give them what i think they should be making, which to me is usually double or triple what the going rate is   I wont be going back, unless someone else sponsors me

Me and my girls went here today for dinner after viewing a distillery. We carpooled but parking was almost non existent. We gambled by parking at the business next door. We were seated immediately. It was fairly hot and muggy inside even though there was a fan on. They need to get air conditioning. I was sweating buckets. The waitress was nice but she needed to speak up a little louder. It was pretty noisy inside with the music and other noise.  I ordered a bleu cheese burger, not the one offered on the menu that has bacon in it. I don't eat bacon. She accommodated me. I ordered a drink called the Peachy Keen because I had just come from the Arizona Distillery and Four Peaks uses their bourbon in that drink. I'm not going to lie here, the drink was not good to me because it had a strong beer taste and I don't like beer. They use their Peach ale in that drink and it overpowers the other flavors including the bourbon. Don't get it if you don't like the taste of beer. My burger, which came out as I ordered it (medium well) was delivered really fast. I don't know how you make a medium well burger that fast. Anyway, It was not juicy, it was not bad, it was not great, it was edible. My friends liked their food. One of my friends ordered a quesadilla and she said it was good. My other friend ordered nachos and it was huge. She ate some and took the rest home. Anyway, I don't like leaving bad reviews, but my experience was blah.

I've gone to Max's twice. They have decent draft specials, but not much else. The bartenders seemed bored, no real energy in the place. I suppose if you like to gamble or like sports it would be ok. They have lots of flat screen tv and gambling type machines, etc.. Not much of a crowd though. Bleh atmosphere. More of a local place to meet 1 friend for a beer once, than a hangout kinda place for a regular meetup.

This was hard to find when you go down 85th ave, it's easier to find if you go down Peoria. There is construction outside but it's nice inside, the bathrooms are nice. Service was prompt and my sisters strawberry milkshake came out quick. This strawberry milkshake was delicious, yummy cream tasting and they give you extra on the side so its basically two milkshakes. I drank the extra one. I ordered french toast and scrambled egg with corned beef hash. I've been craving good scrambled eggs and this was really good and fluffy. The corned beef hash was not very salty, I actually prefer it a lil greasy and salty but it was edible unlike the cottage cheese from my moms stuffed tomato plate. My sister liked her filling strawberry french toast. My sister said the home fries only tasted good with ketchup. however we both didn't like that the ketchup was coldout of the fridge, i prefer room temperature ketchup. My mom felt her stuffed tomato with Tuna salad was just right. She liked the plate presentation and said the tuna didn't have too much mayonnaise , it was just right. Overall we liked this place and its open on Christmas Day .

I visited Delux a few weeks ago with a friend after hearing about it via meetup.com Upon entering, I was immediately impressed with it's nightclub ambiance, blue lights, and the long table with high chair seats down the middle of the restaraunt. It felt ultra hip and trendy. The menu is very minimalist, but I immediately found something that peaked my taste buds.  My hot and sexy male waiter came over stared me and my friend in the eyes and took our order. We ordered mixed fries for the appetizer, which is a mix of sweet potatoe and brown potatoe fries with aioli sauce. they arrived in a tiny lil shopping cart, which was so cute my friend and i both took pictures with it. I ordered a delux burger because it came with gruyere cheese and I'd never heard of this cheese. I requested my buger not have bacon and well done. Another hot and sexy male waiter delivered our food and agin flirted with us. My burger was delicious. My friend and I were very impressed with the attractiveness of the waiters, we even left them a special love note because we are immature in that way, but we tip well to make up for it. I would return to Delux for both the food and great service.

Liked this place better than I thought I would. "D" asked me out for late lunch so we met here around 2pm. It was hard for me to find, it's located BEHIND the AM/PM more on Hardy than University in my opinion. We walked in what felt like the BACK door and immediately were struck by the cramped style of the restaraunt. I wanted to run back out and go to the bar next door, but "D" really wanted a pasty. So I gave in. We walked to the front and sat at the long table with the long bench. That didn't feel as cramped as the two-seater tables.  we both had pomogranate ice tea, which was delicious after I added sugar to it. I ordered the Chicken Greek Salad Pasty and he ordered the Peppered Steak pasty.  When the food came out about 10 minutes later and I dug in, I finally knew what heaven on a plate tasted like. Both Pasty's were cut in half so he and i switched half of each others food. OH! MY! My chicken greek salad pasty was delicious, the artichokes and sun dried tomatoes were so scrumptious. I loved the dressing as well. It was all so good. The peppered steak was also delicious, although I'm personally not a fan of mushrooms and it had many in it. But besides that really great food. I loved it.   They were deceptively filling, so I want to go back and try just the dessert. Was too full to try it this time.

I love this asian style spa. The owner has an unbelievable memory.  I hadn't been there in over 6 months and when I went back he asked me how my grandma's kidney is doing. I couldn't believe he remembered. that detail.  It's very clean and has impeccable decor.  Also, they are fast and efficient. I got a manicure, pedicure and wax in 60 minutes flat. They do your mani/pedi at the same time on the pedestal style massage spa chairs.  I love the hot towel they use on my legs and feet after each pedicure. The wax is never too hot like some other salons I have tried.    The manicurist's are very friendly and gave me a awesome sculptured nail using white powder for the french portion of my nail instead of white polish.  I definitely recommend Perfect Nails & Spa.

My boyfriend and I go to strip clubs about once a week. We like to find a favorite place and go back repeatedly and even bring some friends some times. It's our favorite way to socialize and we spend lots of money.  I have never had a negative experience at a strip club..... Until tonight.  My boyfriend and I decided to try a exotic dance club nearby instead of heading east. We found Pink Cabaret on the map as being very close to where I live, so we headed there. There's a girl at the front entrance to take the cover charge which was only $5. Before entering I asked her if they serve food.  She said "no but we have a list of places that deliver" , she showed us a few places including Dominoes. I wanted hot wings but I don't like the wings from Dominoes. I said, I'd think about what I wanted. We went inside and had a couple of drinks but I was still craving hot wings.  My boyfriend decided to order from Bruno's, a restaraunt that was just a mile away. We asked one of the hospitality/door man/security guys at the front if it was ok and he said no problem, people order all the time. He said we could either leave the money at the front desk or he would come inside and let us know when the delivery arrived. We were like "wow every one is so nice here". The bartender was super nice. The bartender went out of his way to make sure I loved my drink. Our waitress, Mandy, was very attentive. I did notice that she said "welcome to Christie's" when she introduced herself, so maybe they are changing the name of the club soon. Anyway, the wing delivery arrived and the hospitality/door man/security guy came to get us to pay for it.  So we were happily drinking alcohol and eating our wings with one of the cute blonde strippers named LOVE. She was a little hungry so I offered her some wings.  Then this guy comes over and starts saying something about how we brought outside food into his establishment. I thought he was joking so I asked him if he wanted some wings.  He was serious though.  He was very accusatory saying that bringing our food in was the equivalent of bringing our own alcohol into a bar.  I said, "your front desk told us we could order delivery here."   We weren't being sneaky or trying to do anything wrong. We had permission. Hell they even encouraged it. He very rudely said "I don't know how many times I have to repeat that I'm the manager and you are not allowed to bring outside food in". He went overboard in asserting his authority. My boyfriend said "you should talk to your front desk".  I was very embarrassed and I'm non confrontational, so I just said "ok" and packed my food up. I have never been embarrassed that way.   A minute later while my boyfriend got a private lap dance from Love, the manager came over and told me "well if the front door already said it was ok, go ahead and enjoy yourself".  I just said "ok" and smiled. To be honest it was too lil too late. He caused a scene and He didn't even apologize.  When my boyfriend came back to the table, we settled our tab and left.   I think the manager should learn how to talk to customers without being rude and make sure there is some consistency amongst the staff as to what their policies are, so this type of situation can be avoided.  We will not return.

This particular Applebees is a great fun time on Thursdays! They have live music of Brian Legate and the whole bar gets into the act. Sometimes the waiter will get up there and sing with him. He plays rock music and takes requests. What I love about this Applebees is they always remember you when you come in. They even remember your favorite drinks. You'll be lucky if you get Roxy or Wendy as a waitress. they are fun! Happy Hour has $2 beers and $4 Long Island Ice Teas!! Oh and wings for $4 too.

well since i so enjoyed The Coffee Shop at Agritopia, I decided to try Joe's Farm Grill at Agritopia last night.  OK I was really excited to try the food , even though I feel the fries are on the pricy side, I upgraded to garlic fries with my hot dog basket. My roommate ordered the BBQ pork sandwhich I love how the drink station is outdoors with all the condiments that's so cute we ordered our food to go , but maybe we should have eaten it fresh because my hot dog was sorta dry and I didn't much like the garlic fries  My roommate, on the other hand, loved her BBQ pork sandwhich, she said it was the best pork she ever had.  I am going to try some of their other food in the future and eat it fresh and see if I like it any better.

My roommate and I drove past this place a few times before finally deciding today to stop by Agritopia and see what it's all about.   You can't see THE COFFEE SHOP sign from the street, so we didn't even know about the place before pulling in, we just wanted to find out what Agritopia was about.  The atmosphere is awesome, but I think the coffee is what really sells this place. I ordered a Turtle Monsoon which was delicious and my roommate ordered the Black & White mocha hot, she's a coffee aficionado and she said it was much better than anything at starbucks. They have more flavors of coffee than most coffee shops too.   There is a charming den in the back of the coffee shop with nice leather seating, couches and books, a much nicer place to sit and have coffee while reading than Starbucks.  Also, what I really swooned over was the variety of desserts. There is every flavored gourmet cupcake you can imagine including "birthday cake cupcake", "boston cream pie cupcake", "peanut butter and jelly cupcake", "red velvet cupcake", and even more that I haven't mentioned. We asked if they were hiring pastry chefs and they said the owners do all the baking themselves.  outside the coffee shop is the The coffee shop nursery which we took a look around and they had a lemon tree, a pomegranate tree, orange tree, really nice area to walk around and view the scenery.  This would be a great place to go on a first date. It's an old farm and still has the charm and quaintness of farm life. I can't say enough about this place, it was great. Go visit it today!

I've never had a bad time at Koi, I don't know why it seems so many other reviewers hated it. Yes they do add a 18% gratuity but I appreciate that cause I don't have to tabulate a tip. I love their sushi, specifically The Minnesota I think it's called. It comes out really hot with yummy spicy mayo and it is to DIE for. There's a older asian lady who works there who is a hoot! She has a great sense of humor, you really must talk to her.

I've been here before but didn't review. I like their mimosa's. I went around 1:00 pm this afternoon with my boyfriend. They are in a good location right on Bell Road, I think they close at 3pm but don't quote me on that. I really was in the mood for corned beef hash and was very happy to see it on the menu under Meat and Eggs on the Breakfast side. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, diced potatoes, corned beef hash and a pancake. Instead of the mimosa I ordered a big 20 oz. glass of orange juice. It was pretty good. My eggs were a little flavorless, I like the eggs at Denny's better. Pancake was fluffy and the maple syrup was good too. The corned beef hash had the right amount of salty taste, I like mine a little burnt and this had a good amount of crisp to it. The potatoes are seasoned well. It was a delicious afternoon breakfast. The bill wasn't too bad, though my orange juice was nearly $5 and I commented that I could buy a gallon of orange juice at walmart for $5. However she did mention that the orange juice was fresh squeezed so that made it worth it. I like The Place.

I went to Chompies tonight with Valley Movie Group of meetup.com This is the first time I've ever been to Chompies and I couldn't wait to run home and tell you how AHMAZING! my sandwhich was.  I ordered the Aaron's Choice which is hot corned beef and pastrami, swiss cheese, coleslaw, and 1000 island dressing on an onion roll. This sandwhich was huge and stuffed full of meat. I assumed I would only be able to eat half and take the rest for lunch tomorrow. That's what I thought UNTIL I sunk my teeth into that sandwhich. It was soooo goood. The meat was tender and melted in my mouth. I could not stop eating and eating. This sandwhich could solve all my problems. This sandwhich makes the world a better place to live in. I would recommend this sandwhich to ANYONE. Service was great as well.

So me and "D" were at George and Dragon and I was not having fun with the weak drinks, so we searched on our phone for someplace else to go. He suggested a gay bar. I'm not saying he might be gay but is that odd for a straight man to request?.....  So we drove less than a mile over to this gay bar called KOBALT.  It was a bit hard to find, it's right off Central but we circled the mall and couldnt find it, then we went down this little side road near the parking garage and it was in the middle of the strip mall area. There were lots of lesbian looking chicks sitting in there so I felt right at home. No I'm not lesbian but I get mistaken for one all the time.  The bartenders were SUPER friendly and nice which was a nice change from GnD, I ordered a jaeger/red bull and it was STRONG so I officially fell in love with the place. I want that to be our new hangout spot.   It was soooo gay. Video of half naked male models on the screen, and posters of drag queen shows. Oh I love it. I am a huge f-hag. They had a special "end of the world" shot drink for $3.   It's a small place but I love the patio. I danced the whole time all by myself on the patio in front of "D"as he sat on the floral patio furniture. They played Erica Badu, D'Angelo and Jason M'Raz on the jukebox. I love this place.I felt wierd touching/making out with "D" in there (is it okay for straight people to make out in a gay bar?), so we kinda kept that to a minimum even though I wanted to crawl up him and have sex on the patio furniture. The place kind of lends it self to wanting to have sex. Or maybe that's just me.  He said his dirty martini was delicious and very strong.   I recommend this place to everyone, it's my new hang out spot from now on.

So my birthday was on the 5th of May and I recieved this email for a free mini manicure from Sundrops Nailspot, a salon in East Phoenix that I'd never visited.  I made a last minute appointment 2 hours before arriving and they were very accomodating.  I was impressed with their sunny feminine glamour decor and ambiance, especially the chandelier and huge flatscreen tv featuring  "Legally Blonde" which totally fit the nail salons mood.  My manicurist Rakhil, an older female, was very pleasant and told me a bit about the salon and herself as she worked on my hands. Since, I  recieved  a FREE "mini manicure" I didn't expect it to last too long, but Rakhil was very thorough and my nails were buffed to a high sheen.  After the manicure Rakhil gave me the file and buffers she used during my manicure and I love that all of the files, cotton and buffers at Sundrops are one time use items that are discarded or given to the customer.  I would definittely return to this place and even bring friends and family, or maybe I'll come with my boyfriend and we can both get buiff mani pedis!

This was my first time at Benihana and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  We went on a Friday evening, and our wait was about 10 minutes for a table. I was in a party of 4, and 2 other couples were seated with us at the Hibachi Grill. I ordered the Philadelphia Roll, Rainbow Roll and shrimp tempura Hand Roll, as well as a Bottle of Sake. The sake was delicious and had a hint of nutmeg and apple peels. My sushi came out timely before the rest of the tables food was beginning to be prepared so we passed the sushi around for everyone to taste. The cream cheese in the Philadelphia rolls was scrumptious. Our chef Christian was entertaining and funny, he did the volcano trick and the shrimp tail in the hat and pocket trick and recieved plenty of "ooh" and "aahs" from me and the others. I was rather impressed with how fresh the food was and how nutritiously "clean" the food was prepared. For a party of 4 including drinks and appetizers our bill came to only $107.  I would love to go to Benihana anytime, especially if someone else pays.

The one positive is that our waiter was great and very attentive. When we went outside he would come find us and give refills or whatever we needed. My friend ordered rum and cokes and they were so weak she had to send it back...twice. I did not like the corned beef and cabbage. The corned beef looked processed to me. The live music was so loud we had to find a corner somewhere that would not blow my ear drums out. I was not impressed with this place.

this is such a rockstar place, I LOVED coming here tonight with my boyfriend. When we first rolled up my boyfriend was nervous that it would be a pretentious yuppie bar because the parking lot was full and it looks very nice from the outside. I did not realize it was a gay bar at first but my boyfriend had a clue. I loved the drinks they had advertised for really reasonable prices. I had the Bellini which was advertised on a sign for $5 but it was $1 off on the night we went there. They also had a 2 for 1 special on some drinks and my boyfriend's Stiletto Martini happened to be one of them. The martini was delicious, it had like a pomegranate or some fruit flavor to it. Oh it was so good. I totally appreciated the décor of this place and my big clue that it was a gay bar came when I was watching the music videos on the tv screens displayed throughout. There were a few obvious gay music videos, and they were so fun I couldn't stop dancing. They also played music videos from some of my favorites like Kelis and One Direction. The Women's bathroom, which I had to go to THREE times, was nice and updated although very tiny. The patio is fun, great relaxing furniture and has air conditioners on it so you are not sweating your balls off outside while having a sip and cuddle with your partner. I want to come back here as soon as possible. Good Drinks at a Good Price in a Fun Atmosphere.

Last night I went to Blue Wasabi for the second time in the week. I am a new fan. We went at 4pm when Happy Hour started and boy did we have fun. We sat outside on the patio and my group of 4 only ordered 'Happy Hour' items off both the food and martini menu, but we ordered alot. The martinis at Blue Wasabi are top notch, I ordered a Lemon Drop martini, the Mowie Wowie, and the "Milky Way" which tastes just like the candy bar and comes in a caramel dipped martini glass. Yum! The great thing about Blue Wasabi is they have more than just sushi on the menu, so if you're not in the mood for seafood, there are other items to try. For instance my companions ordered the Macadamia Chicken Strips which came with a sweet n sour sauce, and we ordered the 'Fowl Play" which had Grilled and chilled chicken and wrapped like sushi. Both items were perfect to taste. We also ordered many seafood items such as the 'MARILYN MONROLL' one of our favorites and we love the presentation of it but our new favorite by far is the 'WANGO MANGO ROLL" it tastes so different but is AMAZING! You must try it. We are still trying to figure out if the Blue Wasabi is made blue with food coloring or if it is actually a different kind of wasabi. It tastes a lil lighter than the traditional green wasabi. Our waiter Chris is one of the best waiters in Phoenix, he remembered us from last time and gave us top notch service, he is attentive without being intrusive. We were there for HOURS last night and some in our party got a lil tipsy off all the martini's but we had a great time without breaking the bank cause we left right after Happy Hour ended. ;-)

Went to Waldo's for the first time tonight with family who were in from out of town. Walking in the door, we could smell the smokeouse and that whetted our apetites so we were happy that before we could settle into our seats, cornbread magically appeared before us on the table. It was great because we were VERY hungry. I don't eat pork, so I ordered the Beef Back Ribs, which were so juicy and tender and just fell off the bone. Unfortunately they didn't have any house salad left which was the side order I would have preferred. I removed a star for the lack of house salad. Instead I ordered the seasoned fries and boiled corn on the cob.  The others in my party ordered pork ribs and said they were some of the best they'd ever tasted.  It was $2 rum & coke night and of course I ordered one, it came out in a mason jar and was delicious!  The manager Joe came out and charmed my entire party. He even snuck us a lil taste of something sweet.   This is a great place to eat. Go there and try it out.

This place is really beautiful. My date took me here on my birthday.  We were seated in a huge round booth in the back facing the whole restaraunt, it's so beautful especially from that view. I love the ceiling decor. It was $5 Martini Thursdays! so of course I had a caramel chocolate martini and he had a dirty martini with blue cheese olives he gave me one of the olives, so good! for Appetizer we had Lobster Bisque Soup and Spicy Shrimp with Eggplant, both were delicious. I don't even like Eggplant, but this was actually good. The appetizers were filling so we shared a entree of Gorgonzola Lamb chops (not on the menu) with this great spinach salad. I definitely recommend BRIO, those lamb chops were to die for. They pre split it up for us and we both had 4 miniature lamb chops and a side of spinach. That was thoughtful.  For dessert they bring over examples of all the desserts they offered. I ordered Butterscotch Pecan Bread Pudding and another caramel chocolate martini.  Then they surprised me with a Raspberry Mascarpone Cheesecake with 3 lit candles on it. That was so sweet. I made a wish and blew them out.

Friday night, we were heading to Blue Martini for the first time and it looked loud and packed, we were looking for some place to talk. Since Ocean Prime was right next door and didn't look quite as busy, we decided to stop in there instead. This place has a very upscale ambiance and I immediately thought it was going to be a pricey night and I was right. We went to the lovely bar to seat and I ordered some sort of berry martini, it had a fruit ice ball in the center and it came with enough for 2 drinks so it was worth the $14 price tag. My boyfriend ordered a dirty martini and that also came with enough for 2. We had the best time at Ocean Prime, there was live music and they were singing some of the old jams. When they started singing "doin the butt" I ran on the dance floor and danced my butt off. This is the kind of place where you can leave your purse unattended which I did to go dance. I decided to try something to eat so I ordered the ahi tuna tartare with avocado. It came out and looked so pretty I felt like I shouldn't wat it. But I did. Hahaha It was delicious. It wasn't like tuna tartare I've had in the past though, this kinda tasted like tuna sushi. When our friend arrived we decided to try some wine. We both had a glass of Moscato which was absolutely delicious and sweet, almost like a Reisling. Oh it was VERY tasty and I do recommend it. My boyfriend and I danced the night away there until they were closing up. We will be back.

The baguette is delicious, it comes with garlic that spreads like butter. Service is above average. The ambiance with the tea light candles on the table was romantic. I ordered Mac n cheese with lobstah. It is to die for. Full of creamy goodness. It filled me up, best I've had in years. Everything was top notch. My date had the best lobster bisque ever. $41 bucks for the best meal I've had in years.

The peach cobbler is astounding, ask them to warm it up. I read a few bad reviews of this place so i was nervous to try it. My food took about 5 minutes to come out. I ordered the 2 pc. Catfish/shrimp comes with a side and a drink. The catfish was outstanding. Lightly fried and hot to touch. The mac n cheese was good too, and the lemonade was delicious. I was impressed and i would return.

I had a burger here tonight and it was amazing. It was the burger of the week, with cracked pepper, mozzarella and blue cheese. I had it medium and it came out really juicy and melted in my mouth. I also like the seating, we were sat near the outdoor patio so it felt like we were outside but we weren't. You'll have to go there to see what i mean. I like that the seats aren't so close together and on top of each other. Our waiter, was great, prompt and polite. Din't try too hard, he was just right. I ordered a Mai Tai and it was yummy although at $9 a little pricy. My garlic fries were good too. If I ever want a burger, I will go back to this place for sure.

There is a new location in the Union at the Biltmore that has many more flavors of the macaroons. I got a cute box of 10 for $14. All kinds of colors and flavors, my favorite was the lavender, followed by the Nutella version.

My running group and I love Luci's after a long run. This morning I ordered the KRABBY PANTS OMELETTE which was delicious but holy hell full of oil and calories. I didn't eat the potatoes that came with it. I did eat the little ramekin of fresh fruit that came with it. This meal was like 750 calories. I'm glad I ate it earlier in the day, I have the rest of the day to burn some of that off.

we drove to Scottsdale cause I heard of this place called Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles on YELP  When we first drove by there was a line outside the door, this on a Saturday afternoon. By the time we turned the car around everyone had been seated inside. The place was packed but my party of 4 were seated right away at a large table by the window.  It was really funny in there, the waiters had on black t-shirts that said funny things like "HOOD Rich" and "GHETTO FABULOUS" and all the menu items were named 'ghetto' names and they even had Red Kool-Aid as a menu item. Since I'm from the "hood" in Detroit, I found it all hilarious.  Me and my grandma shared a meal, it was called "Ke-Ke's" which consisted of 3 pieces of fried chicken, a bowl of grits, some cheese eggs and 2 waffles. Much too much for one person but perfect for 2. Our meal was soooo delicious, that fried chicken has the perfect batter on it, not too thick, perfect seasoning. the waffles tasted like it had a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg in it and came with warm syrup, the grits came with a ice cream scoop of butter on them, The eggs were the best scrambled eggs n cheese I've ever had, ever, even homemade scrambled eggs weren't this good.   I mean this food was sooo good.   My cousin Apryl ordered 2 chicken legs, baked macaroni and cheese and candied yams, my Aunt Vicki ordered fried catfish, grits and collard greens.  The food there is perfect and I really want to go back cause i want to try the beans and rice, the greens, candied yams, actually all their side orders I want to try them.  The waitress was nice, and 2-3 came to our table to deliver the food and check up on us,  and our table was bussed pretty quickly. My only complaint is we had to wait a long time for our check to come and we were ready to go. We had to ask a bus girl to get our check for us. Also we'd asked for the check to be split in 2 and that wasn't done, so we had to wait even longer for them to get that worked out.  I recommend the place for it's food and ambience.

Went to Shelley's for the first time today. She let me try the buttermilk pie and I fell in love. So I bought a slice of that and a slice of the lemon bar that everyone is raving about. That lemon bar is very tasty. It's not that lemony though, so if you're looking for something lemony order the lil petite lemon bites. THAT was lemony. But the lemon bar is good for other reasons, the crust is thick and delicious.

Warning: Sweet Daddy cupcakes are addictive. I went through a little spell where I would buy them every time I left the gym. It was so bad that I had to take all my money and credit cards out of my purse and leave them home whenever I went to the gym. My favorite is the Pineapple Express, which taste just like a pineapple upside down cake. The cake of their cupcakes is just as delicious as the frosting. One time I bought 4 of them and ate two in the car before leaving their parking lot. It is true that the box that the cupcakes come in as a group is not great, my cupcakes did indeed fall over inside the box. If they could fix that, it would be great but they still get 5 stars from me. I've been to two of their locations, one at Arrowhead and the other in Chandler. They are the best cupcakes I've ever had. I'm currently rehabbing from them and trying to stay away but it's hard.

It's deliciousness every time I come here. I ordered the chicken satay which came with the tastiest cucumber salad. I had to order another cucumber salad it was so good. It was only $2 extra. They give you six skewers of chicken, so its more than enough for a meal. The thai iced tea is so sweet and refreshing.

I went to Kings and Queens to get my tree braids in my hair. I had never heard of tree braids till I saw their ad on Craigslist, but the picture looked cute so I decided to try it. My stylist name was Pebbles. Usually I get my hair done at someone's house, but this is actually a barbershop/salon. The workers there are very funny, telling jokes, great Barbershop type atmosphere with the jokes and people coming in to sell jewelry and selling cd's and dvd's.  They cut hair as well and do wave nouveaus or jerri curls. It took a very long time for my hair to be done, 9 hours in total. But my hair looks FABULOUS. I'll be back to get my hair done again.

I was craving a burger and I wanted a good one so I searched yelp for good burger reviews. I decided to try this place out today because it's just two miles from my home. The location isn't all that great, like someone else mentioned it's more like a convenient store than a restaraunt. I ordered the gyro burger and it was such a great idea and delicious. My only complaint is the burger patty was really small and didn't cover the whole bun. I washed it down with a Fentimans Dandelion & Burdock soda which was interestingly different tasting. They have so many different soda's it was hard to pick one so I just tried the one with the oddest ingredients I could find. My friend ordered the Baja burger and it was very messy but she said it was awesome. She liked the bread and the toppings. We're both fans now.

I went to redeem my Groupon for frozen yogurt at Yumberi today. It was a bright clean location. They had atleast 10 different flavors all either low fat or fat free and a huge selection of toppings including lots of fresh fruit. So I picked up a 16 oz cup and started filling it with pumpkin frozen yogurt. Then I spied the cake batter flavor and had to add that to my cup. Then I needed to try the strawberry yogurt so that went into my cup as well. I topped it with cherries, pineapples, blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. The Groupon was worth $6 and my total was $6.39. Thank goodness I had some coins with me. I sat there inside and ate my fro yo. OH My Goodness the pumpkin flavor is TO DIE FOR. I want some more right now. I'll be going back there again this weekend I'm sure since I have 3 more coupons.

We sat in a corner booth at this small intimate place and enjoyed watching the food prepared in the open kitchen. I ordered the watermelon infused bourbon drink and it was delicious. This is some of the tastiest food I've ever had at a restaurant. Most restaurants can be a little on the bland side with their offerings. Centurion had foie gras tapas, foie gras is my favorite. This was a little different as it was stuffed inside butternut squash and wrapped with pancetta. I don't eat pork but I couldn't resist this dish. I unwrapped the pancetta from each piece. They paired my foie gras with a glass of chardonnay that went really well with it. Happy Hour price on that glass of wine so you can't beat that. (Happy Hour is after 9pm) We also had the crab and lobster salad which was without a doubt the best, most tastiest salad I've ever had in my life. My only complaint is that there wasn't more. we also had the lobster and cauliflower which was presented in such a beautiful way. Now I don't like mushrooms and my boyfriend ordered the stuffed mushrooms. I decided to try one and I couldn't stop eating them, they were tasty. That is my adjective for everything at Centurion; TASTY. Like I said my only complaint is that everything is tapas so you just get a small bite of amazing food. I wish it was all big heaping plates, that would make this a 5 star establishment, but I do like what they have going on here.

I've been going to Ernies about once a week for the past month and a half. I mainly go for the Karaoke, food and atmosphere. The sound system here for karaoke is the best in the Valley and the DJ is great. There are multiple tv's displaying the lyrics as you sing. There are also some regulars in here that sing amazingly like professionals. I'm just a novice and do it for fun but everyone is supportive.  I LOVE the food here, it's fresh, doesn't taste like it came out of a box or frozen. Ernies always have food specials for around $10 - $13 written on the chalkboard as you walk in the front door.  I've had the seafood sampler twice, and it's delicious, it includes, shrimp, clams, and mussels in a yummy seasoned broth with onions and it comes with toasted baguette to soak up the juices.  Another option is the 1/2 lb. or 1 lb. steamed shrimp. It's ALOT of shrimp, but you will not regret it, it's seasoned to perfection, a lil spicy and so good.  I've also tried the shrimp stuffed crab which came with fries and cocktail sauce. That was delicious but unfortunately the last time I went there the waiter didn't know what I was talking about when I asked for it. My date was very dissapointed about that as he'd tried it before with me and fell in love with that particular meal.  I also went there on St. Patricks Day and ate the corned beef and cabbage, which was to. DIE. for. , the owner brought me out some horseraddish and told me to try that with it and I almost creamed my pants it was sooo good.  Regular Happy hour is from 2pm - 7pm includes discount on food and drinks. Reverse Happy hour is from 10pm - Midnight and includes $1 off all drinks. I like that you don't have to wait for your drinks, the bartenders are friendly and very prompt. No waiting for 5 - 10 minutes like has happened at some other bars I've gone to in the Valley (i.e. george and dragon). I usually order a tequila sunrise and the bartender remembers my drink when i arrive, but on st. patricks day they got me addicted to something called a "Nutty Irishman". My friend usually orders the KiltLifter on tap.  There is an outdoor bar and patio as well for those who want a smoke. It includes a big screen tv.  The crowd there is touch and go. There are a few regulars, and sometimes kids aroundage  21 come in and then sometimes it's an older crowd. I haven't gotten a handle on what is the night that everyone loves the most. Sometimes it's a big crowd but the last time I went on a saturday, the place was practically empty. Which is a shame cause  Ernies in Chandler is a gem.

well we've been here a few times and I haven't reviewed the place it's in a decent easy to find location at the corner of 44th street and thomas Everyone is friendly at this club from the security to the dancers to the waitress the cover charge is not too bad at $5 One thing I must mention is that this is itty bitty titty committee land the girls do not have fake boobs or much on top at all there are quite a few girls with nice asses though and several of them can really work the pole I'll give a shot out to NINA who REALLY knows how to climb that pole and do acrobatics, she's the best The club is small compared to others in the Valley and that was initially a turn off for me but now I've come to appreciate being the only couple in the whole place you really get alot of attention from the girls also this is the only strip club with a girl who has actually turned my boyfriend on he came away saying he was turned on and that is not common for him so KUDOS to Sugar 44

I had a great time at Club Fullfilled last night. i went ALONE as everyone else I knew had plans. I'm usually nervous to go ANYWHERE alone, but I heard this place is a very welcoming dance club for people of all sizes. I'm a BIG girl. I don't need to feel self conscious at a dance Club. I've heard that this place makes you feel comfortable.   I went to their website first, and they seem to have a theme every Saturday night, so I put on my white dress because the theme was an all white party, and I headed over to 25th Ave and Peoria.   It's very easy to find this location, it's located right off I-17 inside the Crowne Plaza hotel. Christy Lee, the owner/hostess meets you at the door with a big friendly smile.  The cover charge is $5 before 10 pm, (and $10 after)  I arrived at around 9pm, they have a full bar so I ordered my drink (a long island ice tea variation), after it started taking effect, i headed onto the dance floor, at the time no one else was dancing, but I had to get my DANCE on because the LIVE DJ was playing all my jams.  I haven't had so much fun in a long time , just a release of energy, great mix of music, the drinks were a good price, $5 for most, i also got hot wings for $5 with blue cheese, cant beat that  there was this guy dancing in his seat really good by himself so i told him to dance with me, and he did for the rest of the night  There were lots of gorgeous girls there, I spotted a really cute young girl in a black strapless floral dress getting funky, so we danced with her  we had so much fun dancing to Britney Spears, Katy Perry and Kesha they have all kinds of music though (rap, old school R&B),   i was getting down low, low, low, but I AM TOO OLD to be getting down low, low, low almost had a couple asthma attacks  but anyway, it was so fun, they close around 2am  i am definitely going next Saturday which is Nightie night, i will be there in my nightie dancing the night away  I strongly recommend everyone come there to dance, it is not pretentious, it's literally just a burst of fun and its cheap. Great time

I went to Stacy's for lunch today after searching yelp for BEEF RIBS and seeing the great reviews here. I called ahead to ask them to have beef ribs ready. The location is easy to find and faces the street. They have wonderful side items and 3 different kinds of beans. I ordered1/2 slab of beef ribs, macaroni and cheese and bbq beans. They usually give you the bbq sauce on the side but I requested that he pour it right on top of my ribs. The employees were very friendly and everything was ready within 7 minutes, to my delight, as I only have 1 hour total for lunch. I came back to the office and sat down to eat my 3 huge beef ribs that were moist and tender and fell off the bone. Their bbq sauce is outstanding. The beans were delicious and I even put a lil bbq sauce in them as well. The macaroni and cheese was just so-so, I prefer baked mac n cheese. Overall I had an excellent meal from Stacy's for about $15.

You can pick out your steak for them to cook when you first walk in the door. For drink I ordered the Sangria Margarita. It came in a nice size fish bowl and was yummy, I ordered it with a shot of patron. What a great price, only $2.00 extra for the shot. I didn't eat the rolls as I had already reached my carb limit for the day as far as bread goes. That didn't stop me from ordering a 11 Oz. Hearty Cut of their USDA Choice Sirloin* Medium Well plus corn and sweet potato topped with marshmallow. My date ordered chicken fried chicken with a Caesar salad and cup of chili. We both enjoyed our meals with no complaints at all. Came out in a timely fashion, our server was great, we left a higher than normal tip for her. We were surprised to see our bill was only $41 so you know we will be back. There's 3 or more steak houses in a row in this neighborhood and we have tried Black Angus but they are more expensive than Texas Roadhouse. We enjoyed the value and bang for our buck here.

Groupon had a great deal for tooth whitening at Serene Dental that I had to try. I've always been curious about proffesional tooth whitening. When I called to set up my appointment, I was asked when the last time I'd had my teeth cleaned. It has been several years so they recommended I get my teeth cleaned first. I arrived at my appointment and the office was really calm and beautiful and smelled great. Included in my teeth cleaning fee were 4 x-rays. Then Dr. Hangalay came in to clean my teeth. She was proffesional and had great bed side manner. She communicated with me the whole time. She found several small cavities in my teeth and let me know that they have a dental plan that might be able to cut the price on the service, The cleaning took about a half hour. Then Courtney came in to do my teeth whitening. She put some glasses on me and this weird mouth guard thingy that kept my mouth open. Then she applied some kind of gel to my teeth and used a laser light thingy on them., Then she applied some other kind of gel or liquid with a small dropper. That had to sit on my teeth for 20 minutes for each coat. Dr. Hangalay over saw this application and applied the second and third coat herself. The whitening took about a hour. One of my teeth became really sensitive after the tooth whitening, it was soo painful. I am lucky that none of my other teeth felt that way. I am happy with the result, my teeth are noticeably whiter. I will be returning to Serene dental to get my cavities filled and also for future cleanings and treatments.

I had the opposite experience from the other reviewers. When first walking in I was impressed with the size of this club, it's very large and has several stages and atleast 2 bars. I went with a friend and my boyfriend and we sat near the front stage. The music was all rap music which is annoying, I would like some diversity. Watching the girls I was unimpressed, they didn't know how to do any pole tricks and looked awkward dancing. One girl was a messy drunk on stage, she was entertaining to watch. A customer walked by and knocked my friend entire margarita over. I told one of the guys who worked there and he came by and wiped the table. My friend told him that the drink spilled all over her purse and he said "accidents happen". I was really pissed by his dismissive attitude because the least he could have done is offer her a towel to wipe off her purse.  If the club was really up to par they would have offered to replace her drink which was not cheap for such a small drink. We were there for a little over a half hour and none of the girls that we asked to come dance for us came by. After getting that bad impression from the snotty worker I decided we had to leave and as we walked out we noticed the drunk dancer vomiting at a table. Disgusting. It's a beautiful club and I was excited to go here after hearing it advertised on the radio but they really need to work on their customer service cause they lost me. There aws nothing to bring me back to that club, most of the girls were flat chested and didn't know how to dance. Why would I go back?

while eating my fro yo I was checking out the groupon app on my phone. I was ready for lunch and there was a sushi place 1 mile away offering a Groupon. $10 for a $20 Groupon.  So I got the groupon and drove to M Sushi Bar which was literally on the same street as the fro yogurt place, just a mile away. It was a dark trendy place in sort of a strip mall. I loved the pop music playing, my current favorite song by Taylor Swift "we will never ever get back together" came on and it was on MTV at the same time. Yipee! Put me in such a good mood. It only took like 3 minutes for the sushi chef to make my sushi at the sushi bar. I had 4 pieces of Nigiri; smoked salmon and I don't remember the other kind and 2 handrolls; lobster and spicy tuna. The lobster handroll was AMAAZING. chunks of yummy lobster, soooo goood. I drank ice tea and they gave me a full sliced orange with like some kinda marshmellow fluff on it for a complimentary dessert. I love healthy desserts. I was in and out in 30 minutes.

I am giving this place 4 stars for atmosphere, service and the yummy martini's. We went on a Monday so the martini's were $3 off making them $7 each. Such a great deal. I liked the martinis with lychee fruit in them, I had never tried lychee fruit before but it was sooo yummy, I must recommend. We did order food, I had the yellow curry. I'm not going to lie to you, I've had better curry but that was green curry, maybe I just don't like yellow curry, who knows. My boyfriend had some kind of fried rice, it was good, I mixed it with the curry and it was delicious. Anyway, I would go back here for the martinis and cool atmosphere. We sat at the bar by the way.

Went back here tonight with my family. They loved the zucchini rings and the saffron rice. Mom likes the grape leaves. The wings are really good. The lamb was a little bland. I like the feta in the Greek salad and the olives were delicious. The atmosphere is nice, it's not loud, you can have a conversation. Nice bar and hookahs.

The first time I heard of Nothing bundt cake was when I went to a Yelp event and they were a vendor offering free samples. I tasted the lemon bundt that time and thought it was the yummiest bite of cake I've ever had. I took note of the name. The second time I heard of Nothing Bundt cake they were a vendor at The Kiss Me I'm Irish race that I ran in. Again I tasted their cake but this time I wanted to know where to get more. They told me they are located not too far from me on Thunderbird and 59th Avenue. Today was my boyfriends birthday so I thought it was a perfect oppurtunity to go there to celebrate with a Bundtlet. We got two, one cinnamon swirl and one pecan praline. I was able to taste a sample of the praline pecan before I bought it. Delicious! The frosting is so good. I think next time I will get the lemon bundt cake since that was what I originally sampled. The Bundtlets are only $4.00 and that's about the same price as a gourmet cupcake but the bundlets are bigger than a cupcake. It's worth it.

The Gladly is located on the SE corner of Camelback and 22nd street. Happy Hour here is from 3-6pm and it has a great menu. We went here at around 5:10 on a Wednesday. It was not very busy. My waitress was a female, I can't remember her name but she was extremely knowledgeable about every item of the menu and could name off all the ingredients to whatever we ordered by memory. I arrived about 20 minutes before my boyfriend and she checked on me often. Service was fast; I don't know how they got our food out within 5 minutes of ordering. I ordered the Happy Hour cocktail. It had a unique taste with chili flakes sprinkled around the rim. I can't remember all the ingredients but it had a little orange juice in there. I also ordered the pistachio chicken liver pate which was incredible for only $6. It came in a little jar and the lid held the capers and pickled onions. It spread on the baguettes very smoothly and had just enough of a chicken liver taste for me to love it. I also had a glass of Rose which on the Happy Hour menu was only $5 He ordered the Smoked chicken wings with blue cheese dressing. I tried one, they were ok, I prefer hot wings. The bleu cheese was not the best I've ever had either. It could have used some bigger chunks in it. The Brussel sprouts were sooo good, every time I put a forkful in my mouth I said "mmmm". They came on top of grits that were creamy and delicious. On the Happy Hour menu the sprouts were $5 For our finale we chose the Banana Creme Jar which came with 2  peanut butter cookies. It was awesome and tasted like Banana pudding with a little hint of a nutty after taste! This dessert was $10 and was the only thing that we ordered that was not on the Happy Hour menu. I would go back here to try the chopped salad, the table in front of us had that and it looked really good. This place regular menu is a little expensive so make sure you go during Happy Hour for the great deals. Our check came to less than $50 including 20% tip.

I went on a tour of this distillery with 5 other girls. We weren't the only ones on the tour, there was about 30 people there. The owner (I think his name was Jason) explained how they make Bourbon, whiskey and gin. He let us taste the head of the bourbon straight out the distilling machine. After the tour he set out cold shot glasses and poured us a taste of each alcohol. The gin was my favorite. The other girls felt it was too flowery but I really loved the lavender tones in it, so I bought a bottle. It was $30 for a bottle of gin. Decent size too. They also sell t-shirts, tank tops and hoodies.  I recommend this tour and distillery, they have a good Groupon that we all utilized. Get your friends and go.

I was looking for Indian food and found this place on Yelp. I called and ordered over the phone and my boyfriend picked it up. This food was so damn good, I've never seen my boyfriend eat so much, he loved it. I ordered palak paneer, garlic naan and something else I can't remember, shoot. The bread was so flavorful and delicious. I definitely will order from here again.

I went back to Nawaz because their food was so delicious the first time, I had to see if it was just a fluke. This time I drove over there myself. The appearance is basically hole in the wall. It seemed a bit sketchy, but I ordered my food to go anyway. I ordered curry chicken, palak paneer, garlic naan and rice pudding. The curry chicken is extremely spicy hot but very good. Nice flavor. The palak paneer was spicier than I remember but also delicious. I gotta say I did not like the rice pudding. It was very liquidy and didn't have much rice in it. That was a disappointment. Other than that I do recommend this place the food is quite good and it's cheap was just $22 for everything I ordered.

Fez is in a great neighborhood on Central Ave. the atmosphere is cool chic. The day I went there were a couple of drag queens at the bar, so cute. Fez's Happy Hour is one of the best values. Get any kind of signature margarita for $4. I ordered the apricot margarita and it was really good. Also on the happy hour menu was a gyro bowl, which is basically a salad with gyro meat in it. It was tasty. I also ordered the Spiced Peach Manhattan and let me tell you, that drink will knock your socks off. It was very strong. No wonder it cost $12.95, the ingredients are red stag spiced cinnamon whiskey, peach liqueur, lemon & orange juices, lemon bitters. Very much worth the price. All in all this is one of my favorite places to go for Happy Hour after work.
