Oh, Altered Ego Salon & Spa, I'm sure you deserve more than 4 stars!   But I can't say too much about this place (yet) since I *just* got my hair cut there. First, let me preface by saying I have a high expectations for salons. A salon is a place where you can relax, dust off your dirt and 'clean up'. Personally, a salon is a luxury, and in the end, should feel luxurious.   The decor: Altered Ego's decor is fantastic! Classy, rustic, and dare I say, homey? It's got a very relaxed feel to it, and each work station had its own little rustic dresser of... brushes, bobby pins, styling tools and more! It's definitely a cute place.  O.K., so I must admit I don't get my hair cut often... maybe twice a year. I came into Altered Ego on a whim (I made a reservation of course) because I needed a change. And a change I got!   I got Matthew and he cut about 4-ish inches off my hair. How short is my hair now? Short. But he cut my it very well, and the layers really frame my round and sometimes awkward face pretty nicely. I think my face actually looks a little sharper now! Overall, I'm pleased with my hair and the price wasn't bad either (I've had a more expensive cut and it was about the same, if not worse.)   To top it off, Matthew actually talked about interesting things, and didn't talk too much, which is very important. Granted, "interesting" is relative, but I enjoyed discussing theatre and broadway shows with him. :-)  So, was it luxurious? Yes, in a cutesy way. Was it relaxing? Yes. Did I clean up well? Definitely.

My parents came into town and insisted on having Chinese food, but I told them that I didn't think there would be any authentic Chinese food in the middle of a desert. Well...  After stopping by the Lee Lee supermarket next door (uber Asian!) my parents and I wandered into this place, unsure of what it would hold... and lo and behold! Dim sum? Cantonese speaking servers?   I was pleasantly surprised by how authentic this place was, with the push-around carts and the loud boss running around poking fun at his employees. Everything about this place made me feel like I was back home in NY eating in Chinatown...   CONS: I got a little stomach ache from the 'lo mai gai' or rice wrapped in lotus leaf and unfortunately suffered from that for the rest of the day. I also think the seafood could have been fresher... Also, not too many choices but then again, if there's only a few authentic Chinese restaurants in the area, I won't complain if it's the run-of-the-mill dishes...  PROS: The 'dan tat' or egg tart is pretty good, though I do prefer my crust to be a little more moist.

Prices are great, portions are perfect, and it's fresh! When I spend 5 hours in a cubicle in the early morning watching the guys behind the counter slice the meat never fails to entertain me.   They don't overload on ingredients. The sandwich is simple because the meat is good enough alone. Nice choice in bread, too. And for less than $5 I can definitely make a couple of visits per month.

Meh.  I wandered in here on my lunch break. I'm new here, and I heard the Mexican food is great in AZ and I just love Mexican! I had to try it.   The Hippies Cove reminds me again how important Yelp is. Well, it was a bad $11 mistake that I won't be making again. Here is my review in short:  I was the only customer there at that time. The guy who served me at the counter seemed uninterested. Styrofoam plates. Microwaved food?? Not sure. Crappy cheese. Plastic cup for water. Cute decor, but didn't cut it. And upon leaving, he didn't even say goodbye to me because he was too caught up in his lady friend.  Avoid this place. I'm sure it's a great hangout for teens, but the experience overall sucked.

I don't have a car here in AZ, so I rely on public transportation and taxi services. And for any of you who are without cars, you know and understand how important it is for your ride (be it bus or taxi) to *be on time* or your entire schedule is pushed back waiting for your next ride.  I've had bad experiences in the past with taxis in the Tempe/Chandler/Mesa area: none have been on time/would take too long to get to me. I called Clean Air Cab in advance and when the time came, the taxi was there 2 minutes early.   PRO: Friendly driver. She told me she was a retiree from a respectable place, so I was glad to know my driver wasn't a total nut-zo. We had a nice little conversation but she did have a good sense of when I did not want to talk. Most important, it was **ON TIME**!   CONS: Driver was an amateur, and not too familiar with payment machine (which is fine). However, she did forget to start the meter because she was talking, and asked me to give her an average price I would pay for other taxis. I'm totally clueless how much it would cost, so she gave me an average of $1.80/mi and a $2.50 surcharge (I did see that when she started the meter) and then we fumbled around with the GPS to see the total mileage she had driven. We finally estimated a price, and I'm not too sure if I paid more than I needed to or not...  I will definitely make clean air cabs as my go-to cab service :)

(This review is for Zipcar in general, not just this location.)   I've been using Zipcar for about a year now (I know because I was just charged the $35 annual fee) and it has never given me any major problems. Minor problems? Kind of:  [CONS] I just rented a car for the weekend and it was the *first* time I got a dirty Zipcar (i.e. shoe marks all over dashboard, stained seats, garbage in the back, sticky steering wheel, broken ipod touch) with a broken arm rest. I was pretty shocked Zipcars came in that condition--especially after a year of using very clean and like-new cars--so I called customer service to report the issue and try to switch to a different car. Another incident I had was getting lost finding the car, and that was extremely frustrating (but maybe that's my fault, not Zipcar). Another incident the previous driver parked the car in the wrong lot and I had lost 20 minutes on my reservation.  [PROS] For all these minor incidents, I called the Zipcar number and after weeding through options on the automated call center (slightly annoying--I just want to be connected to a rep!) I finally got compensated for all my troubles, yay! :-) Additionally, I've compared prices with regular car rental companies and when their prices average to $55 a day + under 25 fee + insurance + no gas for free the amount comes out to be about the same...   Overall, Zipcar is super convenient and I've always thoroughly enjoyed the cars. I've actually called a couple of the Zipcars mine and have gone out of my way to reserve certain models.

Been here once... and a half, I guess.   I took an out-of-town visitor here because he wanted Mexican. We went at the oddest hour in the day, which could explain the very friendly service we got. The tacos were tasty, especially the fish tacos. The fried fish stayed crispy, which is the most important part, and the taste was not overpowering. Overall, food was good for its price, and the presentation was not too shabby.   However, two downers about service:  We wanted to sit on the bench tables near the umbrellas and mist, and since it was so insanely sunny we asked the host if she could open the umbrellas. She said she couldn't because then the misters would drip water onto the tables... hm... We resorted to the small slabs called tables, which ended up being just enough space.  [Side note: I went back here again for dinnertime and got seated in a booth where the table was up to our knees. And it was kind of far away from the bench. I personally couldn't stand it being in a skirt and all... unfortunately, my guest and I decided to book it before the server came back to take our orders.]   Also, our waiter was not as attentive as you'd think he'd be with a nearly empty restaurant... with such a small table as the ones outside, one cannot afford to have extra empty dishes laying around...  Overall, tasty food at decent prices, nice ambiance, and really nice fish tacos! I would come back for a light afternoon lunch, but not for dinner.

I always passed this place and thought, Man! It seems like it's only a sit-down breakfast restaurant. Whoa, completely wrong.  NCounter is just a solid sandwich and salad cafe (correction: it does actually serve breakfast food like omelets and all that jazz) that brings your food to your table. The flavors are great and not too overdone. When I went I had a sandwich (forgot the name) and I was extremely impressed by how tasty it was. And the price? Honestly, I've paid about the same amount of money--if not more--on crappier restaurants down the street, but none of those dishes could ever compare to NCounter's sandwiches/salads!   If I had time to go back here, I would. Seems like this place is always busy, though, and with a limited amount of time for lunch, I can only enjoy this place once in a while. So sad!
