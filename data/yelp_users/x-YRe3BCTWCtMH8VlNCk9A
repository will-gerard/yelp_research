My favorite steakhouse in the valley.  I typically order the chop salad and Brussels sprouts, with a Gin Martini .  Service is impeccable, as expected for a high-end steak house.  Love the service at the bar and you always meet some interesting peeps!  Got to love North Scottsdale

The customer service in the deli area has gone down from a 10 to 3.  Really enjoy the skewers, but it looks like only one person can help us out and nowhere to be found

The gin martini at Soul Cafe made by Sean is by far the best in the valley. A must visit!

What a great example of superior customer service, courtesy, and a can do attitude.  Always nice to do business with a hometown company :-)

Drinks were pre made and service was very very impersonal. Needed help. Bartenders usually make the atmosphere and this one sure did... nobody mingled!
