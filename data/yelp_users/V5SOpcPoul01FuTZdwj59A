I hadn't been to the Science Center in probably 4 1/2 years, the last time Bodyworlds came to town. Yesterday, I experienced it again with my now-five-year-old son.   Since we went for the reduced evening fee, we were only able to get an 8:15 pm entrance into the exhibit, giving us more than two hours to explore the rest of the center. My son was pumped, and we spent nearly that whole time on the first floor. He is a Lego fanatic, so 30 minutes with Legos, building an intricate house with a backyard nearly killed me...but I digress. After herding him into the rest of the first floor, the fun began. Luckily, my son is very bright and inquisitive, so he did more than just push buttons on interactive exhibits. He learned.  It took a bit of effort to pull my son from the rest of the activities into Bodyworlds, but he got there and was very good in the crowded, hot, and close spaces. We looked at everything, and I gave him a little instruction at each piece. Thankfully, I had prepped him prior, so he had cursory knowledge of body parts and how things work together. Also, his father is a nurse, so I'm sure he'd heard a few things there as well.   One of the things I like so much about the AZ Science Center is the interactivity. I've taken my son to the Children's Museum of Phoenix a number of times and that just feels like playing. Here, it feels like learning disguised as playing. And, to me, that's the best way to get a child to learn. I'm thinking a membership is in our future.

35 minutes. That's how long my four-year-old son and I waited from the time we sat down until we received our lunch. Granted, my son is more patient than most children his age, but after about 20 minutes, he started to ask about where his food was. This occurred on Good Friday between 1:30 and 2:30 pm.  I guess I should have been alerted to this situation from the moment I walked in. No one greeted us, and it took about three minutes before we were even acknowledged. We wanted to sit outside, but after 60 seconds of debating with a colleague, the gentleman told us there were no outside seats - although we clearly saw two empty tables. Then, the shirts on the employees said, "Unique like a Brooklyn accent." I really should question a company that doesn't use proper grammar. (It should read, "Unique, like a Brooklyn accent.")  The person who seated us also took our order moments after we sat down. I asked for apple juice for my son and was told they were out, so we switched to iced tea for him and water with lemon for me. We shortly received our drinks - sans lemon.   After we were there about 10 minutes, a large party of 10 was seated near us. Half were small children my son's age and they received lemons with their beverages, so my thought that the restaurant was perhaps out of those too was erased. Unfortunately, our waiter never checked on us, and I actually had to flag him down as my son was whining for food to get a water refill and ask - again - for a lemon. It was then that he told me he'd check on our food.  FINALLY, 35 minutes in, our food arrived. I think we were so hungry at that point that dirt would have sufficed. My son doesn't usually like mac and cheese that is penne with cheese sauce, but he ate nearly all of it. My eggplant lasagna was certainly not the best I've had. Neither of our items was baked, so I'm still not sure what the holdup was. And, by the way, the table of 10 received their food before we did and came and left in the hour we were there. While I'm complaining, my son's ice cream was so frozen I almost needed a knife to cut it for him.  I would like to say the poor service was because the restaurant was understaffed. Although the place was full, I counted seven employees, including a manager. Other tables were receiving much better service, so I'd have to say the problem was more with our server (who never shared his name). My son and I eat out about once a week, and I always leave 20% for a tip, but this time I left $1 on a $16 bill. At first, I felt badly about it, but then I remembered, "Oh yeah, it's not like I'm ever coming back here."  *** On 4/5/10, Alana, a representative from NYPD Pizza sent me an e-mail when she came across my review and offered her sincere apologies, a follow-up call from customer service, and a coupon for a free pizza / meal. I was very appreciative of the response, and as I told her, I've been to other NYPD Pizza locations with much better results; I think this episode was the result of a new or poorly trained server.

I cannot begin to express how poorly I think of Corporate Office Centers. As the reviewer before me stated, the location is ideal and the offices are lovely, but the customer service is atrocious. I had a one-year lease in the office with a number of challenges throughout my term. Unfortunately, my requests for assistance fell on deaf ears. The staff is trained to make money, NOT to help tenants. Below are some examples:  Shortly after I moved into the office, I was told that I could not use my AirPort to connect my Mac to my printer and make a wireless environment. That meant that I had to run wires across the office and inconvenience my clients when they visited the office. Apparently, had I paid an additional fee, I could have used my AirPort, which is NOT a router, as specified in my contract and verbally.  Then, when faced with personal and professional financial challenges, I approached the management about moving to a virtual office or finding another solution so I would not have to endure continued financial hardship. Again, I was flatly denied the option to even discuss the situation.   Finally, after ending my lease, I was BILLED! The management requires a substantial deposit, yet I was billed for mail forwarding and cleaning. I had less than $3 worth of mail forwarded to me because I picked up the other pieces. I also never used or publicized the number provided by Corporate Office Centers, as I just forwarded my own number. Therefore, my COC number was not used, even though I still received a $375 fee. And cleaning a 125-square-foot office for $325? I have had my entire 1,300-square-foot home professionally cleaned for little more than that. That amount is ridiculous, especially since I cleaned all surfaces before vacating.  I will vehemently discourage others from using Corporate Office Centers as they are a complete rip-off. I have heard this tale of woe from others who were lured in and are now stuck. If you need an office space, do yourself a favor and avoid COC. It will only cost you if you go this route.

Yum. In the North Phoenix area, there are about two Middle Eastern restaurants, one of which is Pita Jungle, but I've never been a fan. I drive by Saba's all the time and finally had the opportunity to stop by. I was pleasantly surprised.  The lemon-rice soup was divine, and they offer a truly vegetarian option as well. There are also numerous vegetarian choices on the menu. We started with saganaki, which was passable, and my main dish was a pita with tabouleh, hummus, feta, and pepperoncini. I'd never thought of putting that in a pita, but it was a great choice!  Service was quick other than that I had to ask for a water refill. The prices were fantastic. I will definitely be heading back to try all of the other veggie choices, and this will be my first choice in Mediterranean fare in my neighborhood.

The service was just fantastic, and they were in and out quickly. Most of the spots were gone, and the carpet dried within about five hours. I would definitely have them come back out--maybe for grout cleaning next time!

In this age of Starbucks, it's a pleasure to support a local coffee shop. Jolta Java is the epitome of a local place, complete with the friends you'll see coming through as you're enjoying your java or nosh. But it's also so much more.  Decaf lavender mint iced tea is a taste explosion in your mouth, and I am always thrilled when it's available. On my latest visit, I learned that, while the original size is in the $2.50 range, a refill is only $.71. What a bargain! I enjoyed three glasses of my favorite tea while eating a hummus wrap. A vegetarian's delight, this wrap has a hint of spice in the hummus, which is a perfect complement to the veggies and cheese also in the sandwich. Like any good deli, the sandwiches are accompanied by your choice of side (I went with the chipotle potato salad) and a pickle spear. What's a great sandwich without a pickle?  Friendly, cool, and inviting, Jolta Java beats Starbucks hands down for a great place to grab a cup of Joe or a light snack. All food is made fresh on premises, and they have more flavors of biscotti than I thought were possible. Yum!

If you are looking for a Thai place in the Phoenix metro area, you've found it. When I first moved to Phoenix, I discovered the Swaddee Thai location in Chandler. A few years later, I moved to N Phoenix, and I was thankful to find that there was another Swaddee Thai close to me!  My favorite things on the menu are tofu coconut princess and Tom Ka, a coconut milk / mushroom soup. I love the amount of vegetarian options; you even get a choice of soft or fried tofu!  The service here is fast, the food is fantastic, and this is a great place to seek out for a delicious lunch or dinner.

I know I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, but that's exactly how I feel. I have been to Grimaldi's twice: at my last two birthdays to use their free pizza coupon. Although I appreciate the "freeness" of the pie, I'm going to have to pass in the future. Why? The pizza here is just not very good.  I should have known when the waitress offered garlic and oregano with the pie. If I wanted to season it myself, I would have made it at home. Seriously, this sauce is just pureed tomatoes. I think they try to make up for it with Buffalo mozzarella, but the bulk of any pizza is the crust and sauce. Although the former is tasty, the latter is a waste of tomatoes.   Thankfully, I didn't pay for it, because a large pizza goes for nearly $20 here. My suggestion is to head to a local Barro's and get something much less expensive and better. The benefit here is that the service was pretty good, but if you're looking for pizza, walk on by.

There used to be a time when neighborhood pizza shops outnumbered the chains, but it seems that's reversed. So last night, when my four-year-old said he wanted pizza at a place where we ate there (as opposed to take-out), I was stumped. Then, while driving near our house, we passed Barro's. From the outside, it barely looked open due to the poor lighting, and it definitely looked like a neighborhood "dive," so I was hoping for something yummy.  This is a no-frills pizza joint, to be sure. When we walked in and were greeted by high school/college gals, I told them we wanted to eat there. I was educated on their process: order at the counter, sit down, and your pizza is brought over. Okay, no problem.  Barro's has pizza sizes ranging from mini to extra-large, which immediately made me happy. My son likes cheese only (he's four), and I like a little more variety, so I ordered a mini cheese for him, a small for me with tomatoes, olives, and mushrooms, and a couple of drinks. We then sat down to await the yumminess.  I could tell that many of the patrons were regulars. For a Saturday night, it was pretty dead, and most of the folks eating in were either families or couples. Mostly old-style booths with serve-yourself everything, the love here goes into the food and service. Our pizza arrived pretty quickly, and while my son waited for his to cool, I dug in.  I have one word: delicious! Doughy, soft crust, just the right amount of toppings, and a wonderful taste greeted me. Topped with some Parmesan and chili flakes, it was amazing. My son ate a whole piece as well, which is rare for him. For my part, I polished off half of my six-piece pie.  After the meal, we visited the ice cream machine, where my son picked a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich, which we enjoyed there before heading home.  I will be visiting Barro's more often. It's now my neighborhood go-to pizza joint.

Usually I don't like store-bought cupcakes. I'm a fairly decent baker (okay, I'm good), and my cupcakes are yummy. I make everything from scratch, so I am a tough judge of baked items--especially something as simple to make as cupcakes. Sprinkles, however, is a cut above the rest.  I thought of Sprinkles on my first visit because they have daily words patrons can whisper to get a free cupcake. I was in the area, so I stopped in and whispered the phrase to receive my complimentary red velvet. The sales associate was wonderful, telling me all about the available choices. She even gave me a postcard with all of the flavors so I could plan my next visit. I'm looking forward to peanut butter chocolate day!  I make really great red velvet cupcakes, but this one was just as good! The cream cheese icing was rich and creamy, and the cupcake tasted fresh and crumbly, just like homemade. I was a little disappointed that I didn't take more time to savor it because it was a fiesta for my tastebuds.  At $3.25 each, I won't be frequenting Sprinkles, but it's worth a trip from time to time--especially when I don't feel like baking.

Thank goodness for Groupon, because if not for their daily offers in my inbox, I would not have heard about The Cider Mill, a little gourmet "deli" and market tucked in along Main Street in Old Town Scottsdale.  On a day that I had a need for lunch and the time to head over to Old Town, I made plans to use my $10 Groupon. I had already looked at The Cider Mill's website and made my initial choices since I'm vegetarian and I wanted to be sure they had options for me. Not only did they have Sue's Tomato Mozz sandwich as a regular, they were also offering a daily special of three-cheese grilled cheese. I was a happy vegetarian!  I ordered the aforementioned mozzarella sandwich, a cup of tomato basil soup, and a drink. The sandwich was offered with chips, which I could change to a pasta, potato, or cottage cheese side. I opted for the latter.   I got my soup pretty quickly, which I ate while the sandwich was made. It was delicious! Then came the sandwich, freshly made and off the grill. The ciabatta bread was delicious, and the flavors melded perfectly. My cottage cheese was also amazing, spiked with radish, green onion, and cucumbers. I'm not a huge fan of cottage cheese, but this concoction was fantastic!  Although I didn't take advantage of them on this visit, The Cider Mill also hosts daily "delights," including cookies and individual strawberry pies. Perhaps next time.  Not only was the food wonderful, the service here was impeccable. I was warmly welcomed when I opened the door, and I had a nice conversation with a couple of the employees. Although most Phoenicians don't head into Old Town on a regular basis, if you're in the area for lunch, make a stop at The Cider Mill. Your tastebuds will thank you.

I had never had a facial before, so when Groupon offered a "signature pumpkin orange peel and micro-derm skin spatula" treatment at Divine Skin Spa for $39, I didn't think twice. The spa is less than a mile from my house, so the choice was easy.  There's no outside sign on the establishment, but there are also not a lot of businesses in the plaza, so I was able to figure it out after a few minutes of driving around. Once I entered the spa, I saw that it's a lot like going into a massage therapy location: dimly lit, water fountains in the corners of the room, and soft music playing. I filled out my consent form and back I went.  I was led to a room by Rebecca, my esthetician, who directed me to strip down, cover with a wrap-around towel, and hop up on the treatment table. Since I'd never done this before, I didn't realize so much would be happening. I was in for a treat.  During my roughly 50 minutes of treatment, my face and chest were washed twice, the pumpkin orange peel was applied (which smelled heavenly!), I received an arm and hand massage, the peel was scraped with some kind of electrical spatula, my face was moisturized twice and washed, and I got a full bust massage.  I'm a big fan of massages, and unfortunately, most LMTs are hesitant to rub faces and heads - so this was a slice of heaven for me. I was totally in a different zone. Rebecca told me everything that she was doing, gave me hints on aftercare (expect some flaking, hydrate a lot), and told me about their monthly membership.  For $39 a month (normally $49), Divine members can receive a signature facial, 50-minute massage, peel, or hydrating body treatment. Unused months roll over to be combined and it can be canceled at any time. Sure, I shouldn't have purchased, but why would I deny myself this slice of heaven on a monthly basis? I very much look forward to returning next month.

About 10 years ago, I spent every fall in New England recruiting for a college in Arizona. At the time, no Dunkin' Donuts were in the Southwest, so I relished the opportunity to visit a DD and get a yummy jelly donut. Sure, the service was always so-so and the coffee was horrible, but man that donut!  Now that Phoenix has a DD every few miles, the donuts don't have such the draw. They're still delicious, though, and thankfully the coffee has gotten MUCH better with DD's recent rebranding. I typically visit the location on the SW corner of Bell & Tatum, and while the service has been less than spectacular a couple of times, they are usually busy and right on target.  So, today while out running errands, my four-year-old son saw the banner for this new DD. I had a coupon for $1 off a combo, so I thought it would be a nice break. Parking was available, a few people were inside chatting, and we started to make our selections.  Granted, it takes us 2-4 minutes to figure out what we'll get (he's four), but no one was even behind the counter. Then, when our choices were set, still no one showed up. No bell, no way to call, nothing. Then, a young man magically appeared. I placed my order, which he apparently didn't hear. When I repeated which combo I wanted, he said they didn't have grilled cheese, only the ham and cheese, and would that be okay? No, of course not; I'm vegetarian. I was ready to leave right then, but I knew my son would be disappointed (and loud about it), so I ordered his juice and donut.  Right there on top of the cash register was a sign stating that if you didn't receive your receipt with the purchase, it would be free. I was given my total (in the $3.50) range, handed over a $5 bill, got my change, and waited. No receipt. He ripped it off and placed it in a pile.   I got my son situated and then went back up to the counter, pointed out the sign, and the cashier pulled up my receipt and gave me $3.20 back. Although I'm not positive what my total was--since I wasn't given a receipt--I'm pretty sure I was short-changed.  I like DD's jelly donuts better than any others, but I would only return to this location if I used the drive-through (since that seemed to be where 99% of the crew's attention was focused). If I'm in the area, Paradise Bakery is just next door--and their service is WAY better.

I met the owners of Moxie Girl long before I actually used the service, as often happens in a "small" town like Phoenix. When I did choose to move forward with house cleaning, it was when I was moving to a new home and wanted to have a thorough cleaning prior to moving. The owner (and person I knew), Amanda, came to my home to go through everything with me and provide an estimate.   I was not there when the house was cleaned, but I thought the services provided were good enough to move on to a monthly cleaning service. I'll admit I had been a horrible cleaner prior to hiring someone, so having a regular deep-clean was appealing. Each time someone came to the house, he/she would do things I didn't expect, such as make my bed or put those cute hotel-style points on my toilet paper. I guess that, even if you're not a good cleaner, there are still things you would do differently, but that's one of the things you give up when asking for assistance, right?  What I do love about Moxie Girl is their focus on customer service and the slew of services they provide. When cleaning, they use all-natural products, which I appreciate. But, if you just need an extra set of hands, they can do that too. Whether it's help with organizing, setting up and hosting a party, or cleaning out the garage, Moxie Girl has you covered. And, for a busy professional, a little extra help is always appreciated.

As a single mother, I have to admit that I sometimes need help with household fixes. Over the years, Turn It On Electric has been my go-to company for those "honey do" things. They have done rewiring, installation of lights, updates of switches, and even some troubleshooting on the electrical components of my pool pump. Without hesitation, I would recommend Turn It On to anyone.
