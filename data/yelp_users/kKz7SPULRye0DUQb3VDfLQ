DO NOT TRY TO SELL JEWELRY TO THIS PLACE!!  I brought in two diamond rings.  I had full documentation as to size and color and clarity.  I researched on www.bluenile.com before going in.  I know blue nile is retail, so I was not expecting what they asked for theirs.  I had a 1.32 carat round brilliant that blue nile listed at $7000 to $8000.  I also had a .81 carat that blue nile listed for $2500 to $3000.  Using low numbers, that is $9500 retail for the two diamonds.  I figured getting maybe $5000 to $6000 for the pair.  London gold only offered $1400 for both and that included the settings which were gold.  One setting had 1.5 carats of baguettes as well!  These people are hoping to rip you off.  If they do this buying,  just think of what they are doing to you when they sell you something!!!!!  DO NOT GO HERE!

My pool pump was squeeling. I disconnected it from most of the plumbing. I could not figure out how to remove a plastic housing that contained the impeller. I brought the whole thing to Laura and Mike. With their expertise...they dismantled they remaining portion including the impellor...put on a new seal..reassembled it all to a new motor and had it ready for me to remount.  The total cost of the additional help...  $.01!! That's right! A penny for all their help!! Unbelievable!!! It shows on my receipt! I also got a discount on the pump motor as they had a generic 72 hour sale!!  They deserve all 5 stars!!

This is your 'classic american diner'. They have wonderful dinners in the evening. Traditional mashed potato and gravy style dinners. Meatloaf, Liver and Onions etc... A special every night for just $5.50. A long counter so if you are eating alone it is quick and comfortable. If feels like a small hometown diner. Reminds me of the Bakery and Coffee shop in the little southern Minnesota town I grew up in.  Great Eggs Benedict selection on weekends and mornings.  NO CREDIT CARDS or DEBIT CARDS. Bring your cash! They do have an ATM inside the door if you forget.

I love this place!! Yes, I am a local, and live down the street.  Probably affects my excitement a little.   The bartender Jon will remember your name, and he greets all the people that come in and sit at the bar.   He puts his hand out and introduces himself!! Not just a 'what can I get you?'   This peson alone has made me a regular.  I feel like NORM!!! when I walk in!  How cool is that.  You too can have this feeling after just a few visits.  I have noticed other regulars, like Stuart and Sam.  Everybody knows and likes the bartender Jon and comes back.   The mac and cheese on the menu has a zesty bite to it.  very cheesy!  Something you will order again!   You can make many new 'friends' passing through town at this place.  Just depends on your personality.  The gentleman that commented about the 'bridge' area being quiet, is correct.  It is set to far away from the bar.  I think they just added tables to a walkway because they could.  Find a seat in the bar for a nice time.

I do like this place.  Taco tuesday is a great value here!  My biggest disappointment is that they won't honor their special when the spring training games are on....so they just loose this local to the other bar down the road for awhile!  I have updated my review to reflect 5 stars!  I did this as a result of the contact from the Customer Service Manager Jeff.  He contacted me and explained it must have been a mistake on the part of the staff.  They DO HONOR their specials even during the Spring traning games!!!  WOOHOO!!!   He was very genuine in his communication and very nice. It is this kind of reaching out over just a little issue that makes a business stand out!!!  I am on my way back!! THANKS DOS GRINGOS!!!

I can't give this bar high marks.  I know it's a dive bar.  That's ok with me.  I am a happy hour kinda person.  Sooo  my experience with this bar has only been happy hour.  The service sucks.  The prices are great, as is selection.  But the service sucks.  To get any kind of service, you need to sit at the bar. If you sit at a table, you will be ignored.  The waitress never starts before about 6 pm.  so much for getting help earlier if you choose to sit at a table.   If you sit at the bar, you will be served relatively quickly, but be prepared to cash out and reopen another tab.  For some reason the owner thinks happy hour is a great time for shifts to end and start.  It sucks for the patron.  I guess it just make their life easier for scheduling.  Everytime, and yes it really has been everytime,  I have ordered food and drink, and I have to cash out before I am done eating and drinking because the bartender is going home!!!!  I cant say this place would be bad later in the evening, but after going in many times for the great food pricing at happy hour, I still hate the serviice...

This is my favorite Zipp's.  It is close to home and CJ is the best bartender. Come a couple of times and he has your name down. The tacos on Wednesday night are great! $4 for 4. I like the chicken. The wings are awesome here. My nephews always ask me to take them here! A huge 32oz draft at happy hour will make you happy for sure! On Wednesday night the flavored Zipparitas will knock you on your a....! Watch out! That's why they limit to 3!

This place just changed owners. The new owners are younger and want to make it a better place to hangout.  You will see some cool changes coming! But some of the great stuff will stay.... Like Taco Tuesday..Any taco for $2.50.  Try the Shrimp Taco! It is fantastic!  They also have a great fish taco.  If you like bold and spicy, go for a buffalo chicken style taco with bleu cheese crumbles! You won't regret it. Grab a Modelo with these on Tuesday.  Oh, and did I mention..ITS ALL DAY!!! NOT JUST HAPPY HOUR!!!!  Want a little comfort food on a Thursday..try the Grilled Cheese. I think it was like $3.00!  Jamie is a great gal bartender.  Nathan has an easy ear to bend.  The front patio is very casual and nice. Out back on the patio I saw some folks playing 'cornhole'. I hate that name for bean bags, but I guess many people call it that.  Sit at the bar and you will have plenty of TV's to look at...In fact it doesn't really matter where you sit... there is always a TV to see in this place.

I was in the market for a used corvette.  I had done lots of looking on craigslist.com and on dealers websites as well as cars.com.   I came across a 2006 that was on craigslists at Right Honda.  The car was priced about $1500 less than other ones I had found with similiar miles.  I called Larry in the Fleet department.  He confirmed the car was still there.   I drove out and looked at the car.   It wasn't perfect, but it is a used car.  I drove it and wanted the car.  It was cheaper than other ones.  I asked Larry if he could work with me on the price.  He explained that internet prices are generally very low to entice customers in to purchase.  He did offer me an additional $300 discount.  I took it.   The finance guy was very nice and showed me I could buy an extended warranty on the car.  I decided not to buy it.   The whole transaction from the time I got there and the time I left, was about an hour!  Very easy.   I think that is cuz I knew it was a fair price.  I read lots of these reviews, and it seems they all say the dealer wouldnt deal with them!  Maybe these people were unrealistic in what they could afford or what they should pay for a the car.   I could afford it, it was fair..I know they made money, but don't we all expect to get paid?  I had a great experience and will definately check them out when I need to get my daughters car.

I have to tell you about the poor follow through after purchasing a vehicle from Chapman Volkswagen by the staff including Jamie Cox the customer service manager.   On September 3, 2013 I purchased a 2013 Passat from Gregg Parmley. He was very nice and tenacious. That is why I purchased from him. He followed up and did his job. He convinced me to buy. The pricing negotiated was fine. The trade-in negotiated was fine.  I am an adult, I am not going to complain about a deal I agreed was satisfactory. I do not have buyers remorse as some folks on here.  My concern is the follow through and attention to detail. I had a payoff on my trade-in thru Vantage West. While doing the paperwork I noticed the payoff institution was listed as a different credit union called Tru-West. I mentioned this to the finance manager. He did not feel he needed to change it. He said 'the girls upstairs would take care of it'.  A few days later while taking care of other business, I made the General Manager, Chad Hubler, aware of my concern. He must have passed it off to Jamie Cox. I was informed it was taken care of and the check was sent out. Just shy of 2 weeks later I received notice from Vantage West that there was no longer insurance on my trade-in. I let them know it should be paid off shortly as it was traded in, and the insurance had been transferred to the new vehicle. At the end of September I received a statement from Vantage West. My trade-in vehicle was still not paid off. My account with Vantage West was now in "delinquent status". I contacted Vantage West to verify the account status. They stated they had not received a payoff from Chapman Volkswagen. I contacted Jamie Cox. She tracked the check and provided documentation that the check had been sent. Yes, Chapman Volkswagen did send a check made out to Vantage West, BUT they used an address for a TRU-WEST CREDIT UNION located inside of General Dynamics in Scottsdale!!! Why?? because, when I asked someone to fix it the first time, he was to lazy. When I mentioned it again to the General Manager-- He passed it off...and the person he passed it off to--didn't care enough to verify it went to the correct place. She obviously just checked to see a check had been sent. She didn't bother to check on my actual concern of the address being correct or changed. Nobody at Chapman was actually listening to the customers concern.  It wasn't until I checked on it myself that this mistake was even caught. It was then that Chapman cancelled the first check, re-issued a 2nd check, and sent it to the correct address in TUCSON where Vantage West payoffs are suppose to be sent.   Please note, they had a copy of my account statement when I purchased the vehicle with all Vantage West's contact information.   Jamie then explained what steps she did to fix the problem and made note that she wasn't asking me to pay for additional interest. Wow! What a favor! Was it my fault the payoff wasn't sent to correct place, or one of the 4 people that didn't do their job correctly at Chapman Volkswagen.  Now, even though the payoff has been finally sent properly, my credit with Vantage West has suffered. Vantage West is showing in their system that I did not payoff my loan as promised. I have had excellent credit since the 1980's. Never missed a payment on anything! Ms.Cox says 'it won't affect your credit because it is less than 30 days'. I explain that is does show late in Vantage West's computor system.   Chapman chooses not to do anything. I write a letter to the main head office of Chapman Auto Group. After doing this, THEN, and only THEN does the finance manager and general manager and Chapman Volkswagen attorney get involved to have Vantage West Manager Marie in the Underwriting department falsify the records associated with my account. They have Marie backdate the effective date of receiving the funds from October 10, 2013 to September 28. This makes my account no longer delinquent. It also eliminates any damage claim that I would have against Chapman Volkswagen in court. Had I not threatened legal action, these emails and phone calls would have never taken place. My credit would have stayed damaged and Chapman Volkswagen could have cared less.  I received a phone call from Marie explaining she made the changes because 'mistakes were made'. I asked her what prompted her to do this, as I did not initiate this change with Vantage West, and she would not answer.  The 'apology' I received from Chapman was a free oil change. Really generous considering that oil changes are included for from Volkswagen on my new Passat. I guess that means that Chapman isn't really sorry at all.

I found Gemtime about 2 years ago. I have been going there exclusively since. John is extremely smart in his trade. I have had watches repaired, links removed, and batteries replaced. He will honestly tell you whether a watch is worth the cost of a repair or if you should just replace it. True customer service here! John is so personal that I have found myself stopping by to just say Hi. Having done so much business with him...I now consider him a friend and not just a business that I patronize. It is close in my neighborhood so very convenient. He also has a very friendly dog named 'big'. Big occasionally 'works' with John at the shop. :)   I would trust John with any watch I own from a simple Invicta or Timex to my Rolex.  Give him a shot...and you to will soon find you have a 'friend' in the watch business.

The lavosh is awesome!!  Boneless wings are NOT breaded! A real Plus.  They are like flash fried! It is almost like its just chunks of real chicken breast cut up! It is such a huge portion its hard to eat it all! I read Joanne P. 's review about a $9 drink. What?? I don't have a clue what she ordered, but Wednesdays are Crown Royals drinks for $4 bucks. Thursdays are Jack Daniels $4 bucks. Fridays are $4 Pink Drinks. Try a Deep Eddys Grapefruit and Soda! Refreshing! Or just a Vodka Cranberry! Anything Pink is $4 bucks!! On Sundays it's Bloodies and Mimosa's for $4 bucks!   I have never been charged $9 bucks for a well drink at this bar!  Thursday Night is Bike night, so if you have Bike..wether it be a Harley or a crotch rocket... bring it up and relax with everyone! Its a color/patch/cut free bar, so everyone is welcome!  They have live music most every night. Tuesday is open mike night. Great diversity.  They have country and Rock bands.  As its cooling down now, they have a HUGE patio to relax on!  If you have a group of friends, they have a 2nd bar near the band that makes a get together easy!!   Give it a try...

Ok Julie H.   Really.....your complaining about the store not letting you in when you got there at 8.  The store doesn't open until 10!!  Your being unrealistic.  And I suppose it is the stores fault you had to wait in the car for half an hour for the rain to subside.  Come on.....  Why did the store lose your business over these things????  Are they suppose to cater to your schedule and demands??     I think your being unfair to a store you did not even shop in.  I think they dodged a bullet by not having you as a customer....

John and Sandy and the best at what they do!  I have a standing account for a salesperson of the month award. As you can figure, the month ends at different times of the week. My all staff sales meeting is on Friday, and I like to present the award in a timely fashion. With exception of the month ending on a thurs or friday, John and Sandy somehow always manage to get my plaque ready by my Friday morning 8:30 meeting!!  They will under promise and over deliver in most cases rather than how many people over promise and NEVER deliver!    I love these guys!!  Trust them fully!!!
