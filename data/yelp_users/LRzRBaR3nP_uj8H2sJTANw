I couldn't believe that this small place packed such a big punch!!!!! The pizza was fantastic and the super simple dinner salad was soooo good! It's affordable, fun, and so tasty. Just wish they were open more. Always find myself craving Chizona's when they aren't open. ugh. Anyway, I will work my schedule around this awesome eatery.

I've been a Village member for 4 years. Although it has been criticized for its high membership fees/dues, it is WELL worth the money and I have never thought otherwise. The amenities, equipment, classes, and customer service are all TOP NOTCH (to say the least)!! I really feel like a superstar anytime I visit the club and even just a brief visit can put me in a great mood. I love how this place is more than just a gym- It's a spa. It's a restaurant. It's shopping. Its a great place for networking. Could go on an on about this place.... LOVE LOVE LOVE.

Okay, after seven years of living right down the street from this place I finally decided to check it out. I didn't know what to expect at all, but I had heard good things about the ambiance, food quality, and reverse happy hour.  Long story short, I was disappointed with all of those. Atmosphere was very dark and dreary and the food (although reasonably priced) was very mediocre. We ate off of the reverse-happy-hour menu: Stay away from the shimp bread and calamari, jalapeno poppers and bread basket are tolerable. Overall, the atmosphere was so sad that it made the whole experience very blah.

Upon my first visit to Corleone's (On Mill Ave),  I asked the cashier what to order. He told me to get the regular cheese-steak "wit wiz" and onions. I was skeptical about the 'wiz' but I shouldn't have been!! My cheese-steak was absolutely delish!! The wiz melted perfectly over the freshly cooked meat/onions, and that concoction nestled perfectly in a fresh bun! Also, the crispy/flavorful fries complimented my sandwich perfectly. I wouldn't order take-out (for fear of soggy-bun-syndrome) but I will definitely go back to Corleones anytime I get that craving for an amazing cheese-steak and casual/fun atmosphere.

One word- Terrible. After doing some major shopping around Tempe Marketplace, my girlfriend and I were HUNGRY!!! We were headed towards The Keg but upon passing San Felipe's Cantina we decided to detour. We were initially drawn to the restaurant because of it's festive decor and indoor/outdoor seating. The thought of munching on some chips and salsa over a girly conversations sounded great too! Boy were we WRONG!!! Once inside the restaurant, we soon found out that there couldn't be more to dislike about this place. The seating was uncomfortable, the staff was loud and scantily clad, and the food-ugh!! We ordered chips & salsa and a chicken and cheese quesadilla . My thought process was "how can anyone mess up chips&salsa or a quesadilla?!! So simple, right? O.M.G. Both were horrible. The basket of chips came out in a messy heap. There were two small salsa bowls but because they were placed in the basket so sloppily, salsa had spilled everywhere and the chips were soggy. Nothing worse than soggy chips. The quesedilla didn't deliver either. Bland and soggy. What a disappointment.

Takeda Thai is delish!!! I've been eating here for two years now and I can't get enough of their food! As a person of Thai decent, I have been to Thailand numerous times and the authentic food that is served at this restaurant really gives me that 'homey' feeling. Also, I can't say enough about how beautiful this restaurant is!! Although it is tucked away in an older/less-flashy part of Scottsdale, this cozy restaurant is decorated with classic Thai art which provides a wonderfully romantic and classy ambiance. Such a great date-place! :) Anyway, as far as food is concerned.. I haven't found a dish that I don't LOVE- the curry is on point (all flavors), firecracker chicken is to die for, pad-thai is a classic, and the thai basil and spicy noodles are delish!! Any of those paired with a Thai iced tea or Thai beer is a sure bet!! ALSO- If you're looking for an EXTRA SPECIAL TREAT- try the HOMEMADE coconut ice cream or banana spring rolls! DELISH DELISH!
