Good Bagels... Good Coffee... Friendly Service...  I gotta remember this place is here more often.... just a mile from my house and easy to get to.

New Paint doesn't help the food...  I really wanted to like this place. It just moved to right near where I live and I was hoping the food got better with the move. I have twice now gone there and ordered a veggie omelette and asked them to add ham to it. Twice now they have just given me a Denver omelette. On top of that the food has no cooked in flavor it is pretty bland despite having all the ingredients that should make it tasty.

Service today was really bad. The order taker was just staring at me as she took my order and didn't ask the correct questions there seemed to be a lot of confusion. Service here has progressively declined since opening and they never quite seemed organized but it seems to have gone over the edge now.   Hope they get better soon!   Oh ya and the trash has two sorting holes for compost and recycle waste.... But only one can underneath!
