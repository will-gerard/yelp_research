I'm going to blame the lack of good reviews for Monicals on the fact that most people reviewing restaurants in Champaign-Urbana are college students.  Because every local I know LOVES Monicals. It is, in fact, one of my must visit places every time I visit the twin cities.  It's different from most of my favorite pizzas in that it's thin... ultra thin.  Crunchy crust, cut in squares, lots of cheese... it's a very tasty pizza.  However, the uninitiated may order this without knowing the best part of Monical's... the french dressing.  This seems odd (at least to all of my out of town friends in the past) but the way to eat Monicals is to get a bottle of the french dressing and dip the pizza in it.  I put the dressing directly on the top of the pizza myself... it's one of the oddest but best combos you will ever taste.  In fact, they even sell their french dressing online!  (And its worth it, because you will never find a dressing that good in stores.  Seriously, I've looked.)  Grab the family pleaser (with salad and cola) and lube up your salad and pizza with copious amounts of french dressing... and thank me later.

Blurb for iPhone App: Great Enchiladas, Chips and Salsa made fresh, but beans left something to be desired.  Give it a try nonetheless.  I just wrote the last part because I will be on the Yelp app, and notice that I often start my review with something that is not useful at all... which is that everyone sees when searching on their mobile phones.  So I guess you could say I'm optimizing for mobile.  Ok, now on the full review.    Took off a star for the beans... they just weren't great.  The person with me had a taco salad, and said they didn't get a lot of meat in it... and the rice was good, but not great.  However, this was balanced by the chips and salsa (which I always eat so much of that I'm not hungry by the time the food shows up) which seemed to be made fresh, not too hot, but with plenty of flavor.  The "hot" sauce (hot is entirely objective here) was very good, and I used that for my chips as much as the salsa.  Didn't ask if they had anything hotter, as the true chilehead will think it's pretty mild...  I had a chicken enchelada with green sauce and a cheese with red.. and although I usually like the green better, the red here is great.  One word of advice however - don't step on the scale the next morning, because you are going to stuff yourself while you are here.

It's not often I feel the need to rush home to post a review for a place I have just eaten.  But I am in a breakfast bliss thanks to this place.    Moving to a different part of town is difficult, especially when it comes to things like finding all new places to eat a inexpensive yet great breakfast on the weekends. Alas, the Peoria Cafe is too far away for a Saturday morning breakfast run, so a new "hole in the wall" was needed. I refuse the "popular" standards such as IHOP and Denny's, and I was worried that there might not be a suitable spot nearby.  Thank God for Yelp! The reviews were mostly good for this place, which was only a few miles away, so thought I would try it.  Everyone said to expect a line, but I got lucky and grabbed a spot at the counter right away. Ordered something simple; eggs and bacon with hash browns and toast. OMG, the bacon, the bacon.  It was incredible, the thickest, most wonderful bacon I have eaten in a while.  Hash browns were crispy (not greasy) and eggs, well are eggs.  I can't wait to bring all my family here when they visit!   ONe thing though, when people say it is small, they are not kidding.  Even after reading that, I was surprised how small it was.  There are about 15 tables packed in there, and that's it. One of the waitresses was talking about 2 guys sitting at a table talking for over 3 hours - don't be rude, go somewhere else and catch up.  Make room for someone else to sit down and let your waitress earn a living.

Nothing like writing a review at 11:30 on a Friday night after about 6 beers! Or, wait... does that make me a loser? I'm kind of worried that it might.   Anyway, it's too late to get a date, so.. on with the review. Soup - ok. Salad - meh.  $8.95 for both? Overpriced. Watching the carbs, so didn't eat anything that I normally would have. Unfortunately, I checked the nutrition info before we went, so don't know if I ever will again.  It's like pouring some marinara over a salt lick and serving it to me on a plate. Blech.   Honestly, this place never held the special plate in my heart that it does for some people I know, even when it was one of two Italian restaurants in the small Illinois town I was raised.  But why are you reading this? You've been there already and have your own opinion.  Just don't read the nutritional info before you go.

This is a place that I like to visit a lot, mainly for their great beer selection and the chance to play some trivia.    The food is moderately prices, with a burger costing about $7 and a personal pizza running around $9 depending on the number of toppings. But if you like the traditional deep dish Chicago style pizza (like I do,) it's worth making the trip, especially if you like beers outside of the typical Bud Light, Coors, etc.  They have over 100 different beers, with about 25-30 on tap, and you can sign up for the "Beer Tour" and get prizes, discounts, and even your name on a plaque for the real drinkers.  Last time in, they gave me a Cinco De Mayo shirt for finishing the mini-tour, which consisted of 8 Mexican beers. Not too difficult!  Since I am a single father, I tend to go to establishments with a good atmosphere that are reasonably priced, on the rare occasions when I don't have my kids... this is one of my favorites.  Also a great place to play some trivia, if you are a trivia buff like myself.  And when I do take my kids, they love the big pan cookie topped with ice cream... one of their favorite places as well!

My second stop on my Champaign food tour was to pick up Jimmy Johns on the way to the hospital.  I needed something that I could take into my Mom's hospital room (which ruled out Papa Del's) so I stopped by this Jimmy Johns.  I was in and out in about 2 minutes, with a delicious sub in my hand.  What makes these subs so good is the bread... the best I've ever had at a sub shop.   They do really pile on the mayo though, but that's part of JJ's experience... 100 x better than Subway!  I wish they had a Jimmy John's in Phoenix!

One of my favorite places!  I have a confession though... I'm a trivia addict.  So any restaurant or bar that has the Buzztime trivia automatically gets an extra start in my book... but for some reason this is where I like to play more than anywhere else.  I usually hang out in the bar/off track betting area, playing trivia and once in a while betting on the horses or dogs (with miserable results, I hate to add.)  One of my favorite sandwiches in the Valley is here - I love their Buffalo Chicken.  It's huge and covered in a pretty hot yet flavorful buffalo sauce. Unlike most places where it's not hot enough... oh and they let me choose the heat level.  Wings are really great here as well.  Now I'm wanting to get back over there for a beer, buffalo chicken and gave of trivia... Too bad it's only Thursday.    Cons: If you are a young single man looking to go out and meet someone, avoid this place at all costs. Also only a few microbrews, and not a lot of choice of beers on tap.

I've never reviewed an Auto Parts store before - mostly because I never thought of it.  Just another retail store, go in, pick out your windshield wipers or motor oil, pay for it, and get out.  But the people at this store make it one worth going to.  Not too long ago, I went there with a taillight out... they went out and changed it for me! Just yesterday, the battery in my friend's car was having trouble starting, so I drove over there, and they tested it without me even having to take it out first.  They even offered to let me borrow the tools and change it right there in the parking lot!  Now I don't know if they are the cheapest, but they give something that's becoming increasing hard to find these days... great customer service!

I promised my carnivorous 10 year old son some BBQ Ribs, and he wasn't letting me off the hook until he got some.  So we ventured over to Dillion' s on Saturday afternoon, since one of my favorite meals is Pulled Pork, and Dillon's was right down the street.    We only had to wait a few minutes and got a table right away.  The atmosphere is understated... not really a place to bring your first date as there is no romantic ambiance here, just rolls of paper towels on each table for those truly dedicated to making a mess.  If you come here, it's for the food.  And it's worth coming here for the food.  I love BBQ, and this is one of the best I have found in Phoenix so far.  My son commented that they had some of the best ribs he had ever eaten (and he's tried a lot). I also noticed that you could buy the pulled pork, chicken, or brisket by the pound to go... already thinking about it for the first week of football.  If you are on the west side and hankering for some BBQ, give it a shot!

All of those giving Papa Del's one or two stars, I want to fight you.  Especially those of you knocking it down because of its service... here's the thing... you go to Papa Del's for the best pizza you have ever eaten.  You want fast service? Go get a pizza at Pizza Hut express and leave one more table open at Papa's...  The secret is, call ahead.  It does take 45 to 55 minutes for them to cook a pizza, that's how good (and thick) they are.  This place is, hands down, my favorite pizza ever... however if you are especially anal about service, just get it delivered.  Whatever you do though, if you are in Champaign, don't leave town without tasting this true circle of cheest awesomeness.

What can I say that you don't know about this place? It's been reviewed over 50 times...  I had been dying to try it as I love a great pulled pork sandwich and everyone was telling me how great they were here!  Well, I was not disappointed.  The pork was tender with great flavor, overflowing off the bun, creating a sticky BBQ mess (which is just the way I like it!) I went for the ranch beans instead of the fries, and while you don't get a lot, they were very good.  I skipped the corn bread and little dessert donuts (didn't need the carbs) but everyone else loved them.   I'm still looking for the best BBQ pulled pork sandwich in Phoenix, but this is the leader so far!

Can't believe I never reviewed this particular B Dubs! Being right across the street from my work, I spent many lunch hours here eating Buffalitos or wings, playing trivia and catching up on the previous night's games.  Quite a few Sundays as well since I'm a Bears fan, and my girlfriend loves the Steelers, so we had to end up somewhere we could both catch our games.  Love the Buffalitos! They are tacos, except with grilled chicken and your favorite wing sauce! I usually went with hot, but you almost couldn't go wrong with any flavor.  Served with chips and salsa, it made a great lunch when you didn't feel like gettin messy with the wings.  Now that I have moved to the Chicago area, I'm really gonna miss this place.  Good thing there are B Dubs all over around here as well!

This was my first stop on my "back home in Champaign so have to hit all my favorite food places" tour.  I love Steak n Shake, so much that I have to get it at least once every time I'm in town.  Sadly, they don't have one within 1000 miles of Phoenix yet.  The food is great, especially the double steakburger (instead of ham, they call it steak you see) platter special that also includes a generous helping of shoestring fries and cup of delicious chili (some of the best around!) To make it better, both me and my grandma ate for under $10... which is cheaper than a lot of bad fast food places.  I'm not a big milkshake person, but everyone I know loves them here as well.  Took off one star because the tomato was kind of bad and my waitress was grumpy... but the food is always great!

Once one of my colleagues learned that I had never tried Dim Sum, they immediately dragged me to this place for lunch.  While it is a buffet, I was informed that they block up a part of the seating for Dim Sum at lunchtime.  Well it turns out that Dim Sum (for those of you who don't know, such as myself) is best experienced in a group, and they have servers bring out carts with plates of different items and ask if you want some.  Whether it be sticky pork bbq rolls (Very good) or some sort of beef rice noodle, there is about 4 portions per plate.  They set them on the table and everyone dug in.  Now I'm not the most picky eater, in fact I like to think of myself as somewhat adventurous, but when my colleague asked for the chicken feet I was somewhat taken aback.  Almost felt like a "survivor" competition... but I just couldn't get myself to eat it.  Those who did claimed it was really good... so I let them finish them off.  Everyone I was with really loved the food, and I really liked what I did try, so I'm going to give this place 5 stars for its authenticity and food.  I would comment on the price, but I didn't pay, so I'm not too sure on that end.   There seems to be a lot of different options of this place, but I can only tell what I experienced.  They do have a large "under new management" banner out front, so maybe that explains the bad reviews in the past.

Wish I would have looked at the reviews on Yelp! before I tried this place.  I work really close, but thought this place looked like a typical dingy tasteless chinese take-out restaurant... so I had no idea what to expect.  The pictures of the dishes on the wall threw me off to start... and the saran-wrapped chairs really made me wonder.  However, for $3.33 they gave me a huge amount of spicy chicken, which I barely could finish (but wasn't going to waste!) As far as value, this kicks the kung pao out of Panda or any chain Chinese...   There are so many dishes here it would take a year to try all of them.  I like americanized asian, but if you love authentic chinese they have that here as well, as everyone around me was eating things I have never seen before...  I'm never going to Panda again.

I'm sitting in this coffee shop as I write this review... I work from home and was looking for a great place to get out and get some work done.  After trying multiple coffee shops and cafes much further from home, I finally decided to check this place out.  I love it here! I can plug in my laptop in multiple locations, the coffee is excellent (although I don't drink the espressos) and the music is perfect for working, not too loud or distracting.  Great place for me to get my work done! And the baristas here are excellent... the manager remembered me after only being here once before and seems to know every other person that comes in. For Peoria, it's the best I've found.

Everyone else seems to have eaten here a lot, but earlier today was my first time eating at a Chipotle.  One of my co-workers recommended it, saying it was her favorite mexican food.  While it's not too bad, I would definitely not call it my favorite.  One thing that is much better than all of the "drive-thru" mexican restaurants around Phoenix is that the chicken was completely white meat, grilled and fresh, which is much better than most fast food mexican.  The hot sauce was mildly warm, although they put a little too much rice in the burrito.  Overall, pretty good,  I'll be back, but not tomorrow.

Ok, here's the thing. This place is the favorite of one of my co-workers, so she always wants to head here after work (for the famously strong margaritas everyone else raves about.)  However, I'm a beer man, and there are only about 5 choices here, which are a whopping 50 cents off during happy hour. When my waitress first told me that, I just stood there and looked at her, waiting for her to tell me that she was just kidding. She didn't.   Of all the things I have eaten here, probably the most memorable was the pulled pork nachos which I just had yesterday. I was expecting a plate piled high, but to my surprise they brought out the plate and there were.... 6.  Six nacho chips, arranged in a circle on my plate.  I felt pretty cheated at first.  However, they were pretty big chips... and they were loaded with heaping helpings of pulled pork which was really pretty good.  Often I think this place tries to be too fancy with their food, but these were just mounds of bbq goodness. Throw a little guac on top (a combo I never thought of trying) and I was extremely satisfied. Of course the 3 beers (which I saved 50 cents on - each) helped out with that.  So minus one star for the happy hour specials, lack of beer choices,  and the pretentiousness, and the rest is all good.

I recently realized that most of my reviews are of the 4/5 star variety.  My theory on this is that when I visit somewhere I really like, I can't wait to shout it to the world.  Otherwise, I just make a mental note never to return, forget about it and go on with my life.  Well since I don't want people to think that I love everything (and discount my reviews thusly) I'll write something about this place.  Went on a Saturday night to see a friend's band... and couldn't get a drink.  Not because of a long line, mind you, but instead because there was one bartender that never came to our end of the bar.  There is seriously a 100 ft bar in there, and a single bartender patrolling only the first 20 feet of it.  And not the part by the band.    Other than that frustration, I really have nothing else positive to say about this place.  Kind of old and run down on the inside. If you live anywhere in Tempe and are looking for a sports bar, I can't think of a reason to go here.

This is the go-to place for me and and a few of my co-workers.  Why? Because it's somewhat healthy (one of my co-workers is vegetarian and they have a lot of vegan offerings) and we all love the food here.  Not everything is perfect, but the meat is always very well cooked and lean, they sometimes use too much garlic (but I like garlic) but the portions are healthy sized, and you don't have regret later for eating badly.    The gyros here are great btw.

I'm not sure of the address, but it's right next to Taco Bell on 83rd and Peoria, across from what used to be the old Wal Mart.    This place has been an abandoned Mexican restaurant for the past 4 years, and we just recently noticed signs of life in the form of scrubbing off the graffiti and replacing the awnings.  Last weekend, the boards finally came off the windows and a sign went up to unveil... a Chinese restaurant!    While the name reminds me of something that is decidedly not food, the food inside is pretty solid.  I went there for take out, ordered their version of General Tsos, and got enough food to fill me up for both lunch and dinner that day, and they even threw in a free eggroll! (Might just have been a grand opening special though.)  The chicken was quality (not always the case at Chinese restaurants) and the sauce was good, but not that hot. My only complaint was that they had the weak mustard for the eggroll - I like the stuff that clears out your sinuses.  Maybe if you eat there you get the good stuff.  I wouldn't drive all the way across town for it, but I'm happy they are so close to my house... finally a much better option than Panda!

I wanted a pulled pork sandwich.  New bbq place opens up near my work whose signature sandwich is pulled pork. Ordered the pulled pork. Devoured it. So full it almost hurts. Must go back very soon.  But hey, I get it. Some people like their food to come quickly, knock off stars for bad service, like to have a waiter there waiting on them hand and foot. Nothing wrong with that.  Me? I'm there for the food.  When you give me that much pork on one sandwich, I don't care if it takes you an hour to prepare it, I'm just that much more likely to be able to finish it.   Couple of things: Yes, the pulled pork sandwich came dry.  But there was medium and hot bbq on every table next to the roll of paper towels. Must have changed since some other reviews. Didn't try the "hot" hush puppies, but the baked beans were very good. My friend loved the mac and cheese, and he had pulled pork sliders which we said were awesome.  Want to take off a half star for my vegetarian friend that accompanied us... she ordered a salad, and they literally cut a head of lettuce into fourths and gave her one. She didn't have a salad, rather a wedge of lettuce.  Kind of odd.  But then again, what's a vegetarian doing in this place to begin with?  Five stars from the carnivores, 2 from the herbivore.

They have Jimmy Johns in Phoenix? Why am I the last to know this? Now if they could only get one in north Phoenix, instead of all down in Tempe... if you want to know what I think of Jimmy John's, see my other review of the one in Champaign, IL.  I'm so happy they are finally here!

These are some Chicago style hot dogs I could get addicted to.  Great fries as well.  A lot of ex-Chicago-ans judge a Chicago style restaurant on their italian beef.  I always enjoyed a good Portillo's beef, but for me the Chicago style dog is where it's at. Neon relish, sport peppers, celery salt, tomatoes, and a pickle spear really make a perfect dog for me... and this place does it great, for only $1.99 a dog!   Not to mention, their chili cheese dogs and fries remind me of some 2am trips to Hoagie Hut, at which I gained 20 pounds in 3 months after moving in across the street.  Come to think of it, you might want to stay away unless you enjoy shopping for larger pairs of pants.  Enjoy in moderation, people.  PS - This is in the old Fasoli's, next to BevMo.
