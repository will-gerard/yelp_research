I've lived here for 1.5 years and am surprised to see anything less than stellar reviews - especially ones posting outlandish claims.  For purposes of this review, I'll focus on my experience since becoming a tenant.  As others have stated, the complex itself is fantastic - great grounds, pools, apartments and location.  However, it is the staff which necessitated I leave a five-star review.  I have been a serial renter and have found the staff at The Dakota to be top notch and 2nd to none.  I have leaned on them heavily and admittedly, have been demanding at times.  Whether it is picking up my weekly deliveries or setting high expectations in terms or my service requests, they have always gone out of their way to accommodate me, show proper urgency and handled with professionalism and a welcoming demeanor.  If you're in the market for a new place and want to know more than what brochures and websites convey, have confidence in the team here.  Cheers -

Fantastic meats and love how welcoming, passionate and helpful the people are!  It is rare to find a butcher now-a-days.  This one is top notch with healthy organic options.

This salon does not elicit 1 star.  Upon entering, I was greeted very warmly by the staff.  Heather was my stylist and she was very welcoming, took the time to understand my desired look - and not only executed perfectly, but added a bit of freshness to my typical style.  Additionally, not sure how the previous review claimed "unsanitary".  This salon is impeccably well-maintained with a great atmosphere.

Every review is spot on!  These guys are thieves!  It was supposed to be $29 per hour - minimum of 2 hours + 1 hour travel and 22% of total gratuity.  They were 1 hour + late and gave me the same lines of BS seen below - "GPS took me...".  Not only were the inefficient, they tried to charge me 6 hours and a bill in excess of $300!  They spent a total of 45 minutes in my place!  Then, they try to use fuzzy math.  1st grade math is all you need.  I wish I would have called the cops.  DO NOT USE!

Love this place - and not just for the sushi and great good, but the atmosphere and service are top notch!  I am a regular for these very reasons.  In addition to their sushi, highly recommend their Miso Black Cod and Pepper Crusted Filet!  Bomb.
