Been here 4 times in the past 6 months.  I love bringing out-of-towners here.  Excellent art and history exhibits specifically related to Native Americans from the southwestern United States.  Reasonably priced entrance fee.  Go on the tour - they will tell you really interesting things about each of the exhibits you otherwise wouldn't know - makes the visit much more enjoyable.  A must see for visitors to Phoenix!

Tasty place!  Fresh dishes with combinations that are delicious and healthy.  Decor is fun, hippy chic.  Parking is definitely their weakest link, but the yummy food and casual atmosphere makes up for it.

A fun, laid-back bar where everything is worn, well loved, and comfortable.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  Went for lunch today.  Navigating the construction traffic was difficult, but worth it.  I ordered the Shepherds Pie (delicious comfort food!) and my friend ordered the fish and chips (likewise tasty!).  Massive beer selection, friendly waitresses, great atmosphere - definitely worth a try and I hope to get back again soon.

A lovely drive up and a fantastic city view from the top of the mountain.  Great hiking trails.  The visitors center is excellent and even offers a super-easy 1/4 mile "hike" over flat ground to some real petroglyphs carved into the mountain rock a long long long time ago.  Great place to go exploring, to get away, and to bring out-of-towners!

When I get the privilege of "dinner anywhere I want" from the hubby, this Melting Pot is at the top of my list!  Sophisticated, intimate, romantic atmosphere and attentive staff.  The cheese and chocolate fondues are delicious and the "dippables" are of the highest quality.  The whole experience is decadent and worth every penny.  And yes, bring lots and lots of pennies.  It's expensive.

A no-frills, no charm grease spoon.  I felt ill after eating the hot dog here.  I hear the italian and gyro sandwiches are tasty here, but I'm too scared to go back.  It has some regulars and seems to be a popular place with the guys.  Try your luck and write a review.

This place is a nice place to go for brunch, especially with a group - they're very accomodating even at the last minute.  Pretty view of the golf course from inside.  Atmosphere is a little rough around the edges, but the place is well loved.  The staff make you feel like family and the food always comes out fast.  The food is mediocre - never had anything there that was gourmet, but you can get a decent meal in a nice spot.  They do weddings and receptions and the pretty golf course scenery makes it a fine spot for a special occassion.

I don't get my nails done at the salon too often, as I enjoy doing them myself and I'm a perfectionist about the polish application.  Bubbles, missed edges, and over-painting onto skin drive me a little nuts.    I am currently pregnant and can't quite reach my toes anymore because my belly has reached epic proportions.  I wanted to find a nail shop that felt clean, sanitary, and well-ventilated for the baby's sake, and also felt pampering and relaxing for my own sake.  I tried a few places in Ahwatukee and Chandler, and Valley Nails is the only one that met all my nit picky criteria.    Most importantly, they keep the place well ventilated (great for pregnant ladies with sensitive sniffers or concerns about chemical fumes).  Most of the other shops I went into had that horrible chemical smell that made me feel like I was probably giving my baby some sort of terrible disease by breathing in.  Valley Nails had a barely perceptable nail salon smell and that was a huge relief. Second, I enjoyed a wonderful pedicure and they did a meticulous job. Third, my pedicure lasted me a LONG time (several weeks) which is a miracle for my feet.  My home pedicures usually only last a week because I have so many shoes that rub the tops of my toes and my big toe naturally curls upward to aid in this process. Fourth, the prices were average, middle of the road prices, but I really felt like I got what I paid for. Fifth, on a splurge I sprang for a design on my big toes which is super cute.  They really do have some fine artists in residence there and it has been fun to show my feet off these past weeks. Finally, I left feeling substantially more relaxed than when I went in.  Between a lovely foot massage, a comfortable massaging captain's chair, and an all-around pleasant experience, I got some good relaxation done. I'm about to call them to make my next appointment (although they take walk-ins) and wanted to post my review on Yelp as a thanks for helping me find this little gem of a nail shop.

A fantastic spot for breakfast!  (Lunch is pretty good too!)  Fresh ingredients always make every dish a home run.  The staff is so warm - make you feel like part of the family.  The restaurant is located on a picturesque, old-time, americana, main street in Gilbert, AZ.  The line is usually long on weekend mornings, but it is always worth the wait.  Great food, authentic country atmosphere, homey-friendly service - it doesn't get any better than this in the Metro Phoenix area.

Food edible.  The staff there always seems tired and unhealthy.  Even for the Village Inn chains which are already pretty junky, this one is on the lower end of the scale.

My first choice in the entire city of Phoenix!  This place always provides a stellar experience for all of my senses.  The view is spectacular, and I (a weather buff) recommend going during monsoon season to enjoy the fantastic electrical storms flashing off in the distance.  The food is excellent (I also recommend the filet).  The service is second to none in the Phoenix area.  It is expensive, but this is the type of place that is meant to be savored only once in a while.  They recently instituted a ($14-ish? can't recall exactly) minimum per person, as many people like to simply enjoy a drink and the view after a downtown event.  The minimum is easy to meet with a drink and dessert - and worth every penny.

This place is awesome!  The gelato is so fresh and flavorful - made on-site!  The decor is fun modern italian.  Fantastic flavors, great atmosphere,  the best dessert spot in the South Valley!

I recently was referred to Chandler Lawn & Gardens by our realtor.  We needed the front and back yard cleaned up - both small yards - only about one hour work in total.  I called Randy, the owner of Chandler Lawn & Gardens, who followed up with me promptly every step of the way.  Randy stopped by the house, went through the yard with me, and he gave me a very reasonable quote.    Shortly thereafter, his team was at our house, expertly trimming our shaggy yard into a tidy oasis.  The guys on the team were bilingual, a fact I appreciate when I have to talk to them because I'm not bilingual (my Spanish is pretty poor - and I'm embarrased to use it, but will in a pinch).  They were done with all the work in just under an hour and did everything on my list, just like I wanted!  I appreciated how professional they were.  I will definitely use them again and feel comfortable referring them to friends and family.

Their website says, "Our physicians go to Chandler Regional Hospital and Banner Desert Samaritan Hospital, and see our newborns in the hospitals," but their office staff just told me they, in fact, don't go to Banner Desert and only work out of Chandler Regional.  Bummer!    Otherwise, they seem very reassuring and kind to this soon-to-be-momma.  Their website contains lots of helpful information and direction which this newbie parent appreciates a whole lot.

A great Safeway.  The staff is generally very attentive.  The place is neat and tidy.  The Starbucks in the front of the store usually has a line, but the staff is always peppy and fast.  There's a nice sitting area in the front of the store with big windows to watch the world go by and sip a latte or eat a deli sandwich in the air conditioning.  No complaints about this store from me!

The decor is nice.  Makes me feel like I'm in a modern HGTV bathroom - but in a nice and restaurant-appropriate way.  They have an outdoor patio with fireplace that looks like a fine place to enjoy a cocktail, although I didn't do that. The ambiance is surprisingly low on snotty, given their abuse of the trendiest foodie terms on their menu.   I was excited to read through the menu, but disappointed at the flavors - the dishes didn't stand up to all the high falootin' foodie terms used to describe them.  The organic salad tasted very, um, organic - had "earthy" dirt-like flavor which I found unappealing.  I let the husband finish the salad off.  For the main course, I had the buttermilk fried chicken, paired with gently steamed veggies and potatoes/gravy.  The gravy was delicious and smooth; the chicken was moist and not greasy at all.  My husband had the risotto, which left something to be desired.  The risotto was well cooked, but the flavors of the dish had a stinky-foot quality I didn't appreciate.  Neither did my husband - so he gratefully finished my chicken dish. On another night, we decided to give it another try with visiting family.  The salad was once again infused with an earthy flavor that nobody liked, but everyone noticed.  The main dishes were well prepared (meats cooked to perfection, veggies still had crisp, sauces doled out in perfect amounts) - you can tell there is some excellent technique going on in that kitchen, but the flavors left something to be desired.  Nothing tickled my palate in the same way the presentation pleased my eyes, or the menu description made my mouth water.  I've had better tasting fine food, and will probably choose to spend my fine dining dollars elsewhere in the future.  I may give it a few years and, if still there, return to see if the chef has improved the flavors with time and experience.

Belle Melange is a new-er salon in Ahwatukee.  Thoughtful details and excellent technique make this place my favorite salon.  I moved out of state, but will only allow Shaunte at Belle Melange to cut and color my uncooperative fine hair - so my hair must wait for my trips to AZ!    I followed Shaunte (the owner of Belle Melange) from another salon in Phoenix, and I am thrilled she has created such a beautiful, full-service, top notch salon!  They offer a full range of services, from hair to skin to nails and even recently added a masseur.  The environment of the salon is excellent, but nothing compares to the actual services you receive there - In the past, I've paid up to $400 for a good cut and color at other salons and have not received nearly the quality services I receive from Belle Melange.  Belle Melange is very reasonable for the expert service you receive.  I always go in with a vague idea of what I want and Shaunte has the vision and skill to see what works well with my hair to bring out the best in it.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Darling husband and I took a chance on a brand new restaurant with a cute back story we saw in the local paper (http://www.azcentral.com/community/chandler/articles/2009/06/15/20090615cr-restaurant0617.html).  The new restaurant shares some of the decor of its predecesor, 56 East, but nothing else.  Fired Up Grill is a brand-spankin' new bar and grill you can feel good about spending money at.  Their story is truly inspirational.  We enjoyed some fine drinks from their full bar and a delicious skewered caprese-style appetizer.  Next we chowed on a comforting bowl of their "Pelligrino" pasta, the sauce was a tad bland, but the pasta was delectable and the grilled ham and chicken atop were tasty.  On to desert - a chocolate ravioli with raspberry sauce - not my favorite but not bad.  The misters on the patio and the open air interior lent the restaurant a casual and homey atmosphere unknown in its past life as 56 East.  The local, family-style hospitality is apparent in the attentive staff and personable owners - who might stop by your table to say hello.  All in all, a great place to enjoy happy hour with friends and soak up the beautiful evening weather via their nifty open air bar design.

Oil change was complete in a surprising 10 minutes, the staff was very professional and courteous, the waiting room was tidy and well air-conditioned, and they gave my car a thorough vacuum and window wash.  They did run through their usual upsell drill, but I have never had any oil change or car repair done where whoever it was, at Jiffy Lube or not, didn't put me through the upsell drill.  They honored my $13 off coupon (got mine in the mail).  This particular Jiffy Lube is a newer location, and feels more clean and inviting as a result.  Also, the location seemed less busy than others (or perhaps I just got lucky on timing).  I'd recommend this location!
