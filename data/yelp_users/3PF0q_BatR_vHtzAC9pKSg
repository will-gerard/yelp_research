Finally made it to the Melting Pot. It's been on our "must try" list for a very long time.  I've seen some reviews that complain about the service, but we didn't have any complaints. We were immediately seated (we did have reservations) and promptly served. This is not a quick dining experience,  so come prepared to spend some time and bit be in a rush.  We had 4 in our party. We each ordered the unlimited 4 course meal, which is by far the best value. The cheese course was yummy, but word to the wise - don't fill up on bread! The Caprese salads were perfect - very fresh. The meat course was great. We had filet, teriyaki steak, shrimp, ravioli, and chicken. We also added the lobster tail for an additional $8. Everything was fresh, tender and delicious!  We ended our dinner with the Chocolate Turtle fondue for dessert. Fabulous! Just wish we weren't so full so we could've eaten more.   Our server, Steven, was on the ball, did a great job explaining everything, and we were quite impressed.   Be prepared to spend a decent chunk of change there. You're paying for the experience and extra work the servers have to do, but it's worth it.

We've been to Comerica/Dodge Theater many times over the years.  Most of the time, the experience is enjoyable, even though the acoustics aren't great.  Last night, we saw Adam Sandler, David Spade, Rob Schneider, et al. The show was supposed to start at 8 pm. As usual, we arrived about 30 mins prior to showtime to grab a beer and get seated.   Normally, doors open about an hour prior to showtime, but when we arrived, the lines were around the building and down a couple of blocks. Doors didn't even open until 7:55!  I don't know if they didn't have enough staff, but the staff they did have was extremely slow moving.  I asked a few staff members what the hold up was, but just got blank looks and mumbled responses. It would have been nice if someone came out and apologized to everyone, but that certainly didn't happen.  You'd assume they'd start the show quite a bit layer to allow people to get drinks, get seated. They started about 15 mins late, and over half the audience was still in lobby! So, everyone was filing in to seats in the dark. Again, a helpful announcement would have been nice.  The bartender we happened to get was slower than a turtle, and when we asked why drink prices weren't posted, another blank stare came our way.  So, I'm thinking we'll skip this venue in the future. We go to a lot of concerts around the valley and I'm just tired of the poorly managed and unfriendly staff.

They did a fabulous, reasonably priced job on our Persian Rug!!! I brought it in, and it was done several days before expected. So happy with the service and quality job. I'll definitely use again!

Best meal we've had in ages! We purchased a Groupon (always a little wary about how we'll be treated with those) and our experience was awesome!  We enjoyed oysters, lobster sashimi, salmon, Brussels sprouts, mushrooms and desserts. Every single thing was perfection!! I have never said that about any meal!  The service was top notch and our server was extremely knowledgeable about both the food and the wine options.  I recommend Roka Akor to anyone wanting to enjoy an awesome meal.

This is my 2nd review of this fabulous restaurant!  I'll admit that going out to dinner on Valentine's Day fills me with angst. Restaurants are overcrowded, service isn't up to par and the food is normally not as good as it usually is. So, as much as we loved Roka Akor the last time, I was scared to tarnish that memory.   I can joyfully say that it was a fabulous night and the food and service did not disappoint!  We had the fixed price 7 course dinner and every single bite was FABULOUS! ! I could rave on and on about all of it, but our absolute favorite was the A5-9+ Japanese Wagyu Striploin. We ordered it med - rare and it melted in our mouthes! It was served with the Japanese Wild Mushroom Hotpot w/ Fresh Truffle - sooooo delicious! The Chilean Sea Bass with Yozu Truffle Butter & Salmon Roe was piping hot and cooked to perfection. Hard to do in large quantities. The Grilled Asparagus w/ Wafu Dressing & Sesame was also just right. I hate soggy or overcooked veggies, but these were perfect - tender, yet crisp.  It was especially nice to see our server working so hard at keeping everyone happy. He could have easily been flustered by the enormous crowd, but he was so attentive, even having time to joke around a bit while doing a phenomenal job! Kudos to the chef, kitchen staff, wait staff and management for giving us the best meal we've ever had on Valentine's Day!

Love 5th & Wine!!! We go there quite a bit, and I've tried many of their menu options. The selection of wine is always top notch. The mixed drinks are very good and I challenge anyone to find a better Bloody Mary for Sunday Brunch!  From their Fried Pickles to the Bruschetta,  to the daily Risotto - everything is delicious. The Tuna Poke is always fresh, so if you enjoy the raw stuff, go for it.  I've never has bad service and, if you go on the weekends, take advantage of the live music on the patio. Always pleasant and entertaining.  5th & Wine is a great place to hang out and enjoy goof food, good wine, and good music.

One of my favorite places to meet friends! They have a great Happy Hour menu and the service is always great.  My personal faves are the homemade potato chips with dip (always a hit!) and the Calamari Salad. The Calamari was always my "go-to" dish, but the last 2 times I've ordered it I've been disappointed.  I've been told about kitchen staff changes and recipe changes, but I feel like they took a great recipe and ruined it.  I still love the location, staff and ambiance, so I'll just find new dishes to order. I've had their mushroom pizza and a few of their other dishes. All good. Hopefully no more recipe changes in the future.

LOVE this place! I've been here many times, at least once a week lately, and I'm never disappointed.  The sushi is always fresh, the drinks are great and the service never lacks.  If you like the more rare types of sushi and sashimi, always ask if they have it. Escolar isn't on the regular menu, but they often have it and the sashimi plate is so good.  I recommend Sushi Brokers on Indian School to everyone - it's just great!

Decided to try this tonight because we received a coupon for a free meal. My advice - it's not worth going even if it's free.  We were greeted and seated. With many empty tables around, we were seated at one that was dirty and sticky. When I asked about beer choices, the hostess had to look across the restaurant at the cooler. Served beer with chilled glasses, but we opted to drink out of the cleaner looking bottles.  Food was sub-par, at best. Nothing was great, or even good. My son, who will literally eat just about everything and loves all manner of Asian food, went for the pizza after trying several options. I've never seen him leave so much on his plate!  Many of the options weren't labeled, like the flavors of ice cream, sushi rolls, etc. One thing that weirded me out - the chocolate fountain with marshmallows sat right next to the marinated octopus.  Not so appetizing!   The ambiance was similar to an old Kmart diner, especially the lighting. There was masking tape covering holes in the wall and post - it notes numbering the tables. The wire mesh condiment holders on the tables still had the price tags on them.  I could continue, but there is no point. Won't ever return.

Wanted to find a new Italian restaurant and a couple of friends suggested Vivo. I'm so grateful they did! We had a delicious dinner tonight and we'll definitely be back!   I started with the Lobster Bisque and it was awesome! Definitely worth the $11 price! Enjoyed the yummy Veal Piccata,  followed by the Tiramisu. Hubby and father-in-law both had the homemade pasta with meatballs. Brother-in-law had the salmon and son had the Black Linguine with Langostino Lobster and Scallops. Amazing!   The service was excellent - zero complaints. Thank you Vivo!

Fabulous meal! Fabulous service! We enjoyed everything we ordered - oysters on the half shell, lobster, brisket and snow crab legs. The Clam Digger (Bloody Mary) was so good, we had to order more. Will definitely be back!

LOVE seeing Lorrie for facials, derma blading, peels, etc. She's so knowledgeable and thorough, and she creates a warm and relaxing atmosphere. Since I've  been seeing Lorrie regularly for the past couple of years, my skin has never looked better!
