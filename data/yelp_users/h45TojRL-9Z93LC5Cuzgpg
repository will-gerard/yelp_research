My first time at this restaurant for our 9th anniversary.  Sat us at a table next the windows, I had a great view, by husband didn't has there was a pillar in the way.  The table next to us, with a full great view, stayed vacant the entire time we were there.  I'm assuming they like to keep diners together.    My halibut with laughing bird shrimp and peruvian purple potatoes was to die for, I ate the whole thing.  My husband was just okay with his veal cheeks, didn't care for the sauce and wished he had ordered the halibut too.  The dessert menu was very odd, we didn't order anything, but they brought us a little dessert that had "Happy Anniversary" stenciled on the plate, nice touch.

The rating is for their macarons.  Finally made it to the bakery when they were open.  Bought the package of mini macarons so that I could try a selection of flavors.  Oh, they are little pieces of heaven...  You must eat them slowly and enjoy the experience.  The raspberry with the filing that is flavored with rose petal essence are my favorite.

Had dinner here the other night for my birthday.  I've been to teppanyaki restaurants before and have had a good time as the chef always told jokes while he was cooking and really kept us entertained throwing stuff up in the air.  So we decided to try Benihana's.    Unfortunately, I think maybe our chef was new as he really just concentrated on his cooking and didn't tell a single joke.  His "performance" was boring, I think he only got 2 shrimp tails in his hat!  The food was very pricey, but the shrimp was tasty.  You need to eat as you go otherwise the food gets cold.  They brought the rice too early and it sat there getting cold while the chef was cooking the meats.  They need little rice pots with a lid instead of the bowls.  They also kept pushing the birthday club and the manager even came around and handed each of us a form to fill out.  This just wasn't the experience I was hoping for.

Dined here for the 2nd time last night.  Had the crab cake the first time and I hate to say but I've had much better.  Last night I had the omelet and salad.  They put anything you want in the omelet.  I had Swiss cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes and asparagus.  It was delicious.    I can't say enough about the great staff.  Very friendly and attentive.  The view is great and we enjoyed watching the monsoon hit the windows last night!

I've been to The Vig Uptown several times now and I love it, especially during Happy Hour!  The decor is so stylish and everyone is friendly and helpful.  I get the Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken every time, it's that good.  My husband has ordered something different each time and has liked them all.  Just a word of warning, concrete floors.  So when the place is full it's very loud.  Not a good place for friends to catch up as you have to practically yell at each other.  But when you're eating food this good, who's going to do much talking anyway?

This is one of my new fav places to shop.  I've found several cute dresses, a great necklace, fun note cards and hilarious frig magnets.  So much fun stuff!
