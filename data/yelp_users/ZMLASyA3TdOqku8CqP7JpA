I had an uncontrollable urge for an old fashioned soda so Yelped "soda fountain drinks" in the area. MacAlpine's popped up with some good reviews. From the outside we would never have walked inside!  This antediluvian restaurant/coffee shoppe is really pushing the limit on dirty vs nostalgic. The wait staff were dressed in mismatched outfits, grungy socks and shoes. The shelves in the restaurant itself are packed full of ageless classic memorabilia. It was fun to sit and let your eyes wonder over everything ~ almost overwhelming. We're talking "out of control packed"!  Walking in we really did not know if we were in the right place because you don't walk directly into the restaurant. There are technically three rooms that cross in the center room which is the restaurant. Each of the side rooms are small and hold antiques, clothing, furniture pictures and misc. items.   Our waitress was friendly and service was OK. I had an old fashion soda with lime syrup, vanilla ice cream and a shot of phosphate. It was refreshing. The hubster had a tuna melt and a root beer shake. There is plenty on the menu to please any palate.

On our way cross country we decided to stop and get one of our favorites ~ a 23 Skidoo. We have been stopping into the Sugar Bowl for YEARS on our travels to the Scottsdale area. We were sooooo disappointed. It is not the same. The restaurant itself was dirty, paper on the floor, customers standing around without anyone greeting them.  A 23 Skidoo is (was) one of my all time favorite ice cream treats. The wonderful chocolate coffee syrup was nothing like it was. in fact, it was like coffee had simply been poured in the middle with one scoop of ice cream on the bottom and one scoop above the coffee (see my picture of the 23 skidoo). The glass was sticky from where ice cream hands had handled it. When I asked about why the difference, our waitress responded with, "we have knew people we're training and everyone makes it different."   I ask our waitress to bring me some chocolate syrup ~ it never came. She said she asked another wait staff to bring it over. Umm, if you are a waitress waiting on a customer you respond directly and then follow up with our customers. Perhaps more customer service training is needed.   I also ordered the tea sandwiches which is a combination of 3 triangle tea sandwiches; egg salad, tuna salad and corn beef salad. The bread was dry as if the sandwich had been made up and left out until someone else ordered the same sandwiches.   This restaurant is in a prime location in Old Scottsdale ~ it is incredibly sad to watch this '50 style diner show they do not care about their customers/restaurant like it use to.

Hungry for pizza so scouted out the area and found this place in Heritage Square. According to their website: The New York Times call the pizza "perhaps the best in America" ("The Road to Pizza Nirvana goes through Phoenix", NYT, July 2004.) Rachael Ray declared Pizzeria Bianco the winner of her Pizza Madness Bracket, a contest of pizzerias across the nation in 2010. Food & Wine has labeled Chris' pizza as "arguably the best pizza in America" (June 2005, June 2009).  So how can it not be great pizza, right?!!  It was 30 min before closing but we were greeted with a smile and welcomed to find a seat.   We ordered the Margarita Pizza ~ made with fresh (local) mozzarella and crushed tomato sauce (scored with hubster on that one because he is not a lover of sliced tomatoes!) and leaves of fresh basil ~ YUM! Loved the crust but not the burnt parts :(  Had the crust not been burnt along the edges, I would have scored this one a 5. Delicious!

Quaint old cafe style restaurant booming with flavor. The Basmati Rice is scrumptious!  I couldn't decide between the beef or chicken ~ after asking our waitress she said the chicken kabobs are more popular. Then chicken it is! So tender, moist and spot on! Highly recommend the chicken kabobs.   I ordered a side dish of the couscous simply to try it. I had the sauce put on the side. I'm so glad I did because I did not care for it at all. Sadly, they used the same liquid to cook the couscous so I could not get away from the flavor.   The hubster ordered sliced chicken in a tomato based sauce with red and green peppers. He totally enjoyed every bite. For an appetizer we ordered the chickpea hommus with pita bread. The "hommus", as they call it, was smooth with a definite chickpea taste and just the right amount of garlic. The disappointment was in the pita bread. It was not fresh, homemade pita bread you would expect at an authentic Mediterranean restaurant, it was store bought! Totally surprised us ~ and not in a good way.

Nice breakfast diner. We had scrambled eggs, omelette, fried potatoes, toast and english muffin. Outside of the liquid butter/oil they put on their toast, breakfast was pretty good. Coffee is great!
