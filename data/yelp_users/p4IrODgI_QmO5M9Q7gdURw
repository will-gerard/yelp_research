Being born in the UK to a long line of English, Welsh, Irish and Scots, so there's nothing more I'd like than for a good Brit pub to thrive in PHX.  That said, this place has the bones and makes an attempt, but falls short.   It's kinda divey, but that's fine.  The beer selection is great.  The crowd is diverse.  Good music, lots of sports on the TV, etc.  On the flip side:  The staff has good intentions, but is not well trained.  They do the job, but don't anticipate - you have to ask.  They don't seem empowered.  We ordered some happy hour food at 6:55, for example, and they said it was over.  It wasn't 7, but they explained the "computers" made the call.  This wasn't something we brought up at 10 p.m. - but before it was 7!   A guy next to us ordered food to go and sat there for 40 minutes.  He kept asking and the response was "it wasn't up" but then he got mad and it magically appeared all boxed and ready.  Bottom line:  service is o.k. for a bar, but the food thing seems to flummox them.  The menu covers a wide range of bases, but also is a series of hits and misses.  We went one weekend for the Sunday Roast.  It was a generous plate of veggies, mash and a massive yorkshire pud.  But the beef wasn't roast anything... more like steak-ums.  The gravy was from a can/jar.   Now some might say this is trivial, but a good Sunday Roast Beef meal to the English is like a Thanksgiving dinner in the US.  You can't serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides... the main dish needs to be lovingly prepared.  On another night, the Scotch eggs followed the same theme.  A great idea.  The dish was served with a wide range of extras, but the core food was odd.  Not bad, but the casing was an inch thick and dry.  I'd love to see this place work.  They offer a menu of what should be made, but just don't quite deliver a good food product.  To be fair, the market might not support it and are happy with ho hum stuff, but on the flip side I've enjoyed much more inspired fare in CA - not just the U.K.

To be fair I've only eaten there once - tonight - and all I had was a salad and brought my own wine.  Still, my tab:  $27.   Ouch!    I can appreciate a corkage fee, but I'm scratching my head in a way... it wasn't a $100 bottle... more like $10.  The staff didn't open it, touch it,  decanter it, chill it, pour it.  They might have not even seen it, but for my asking.  As for the salad, it was good, but nothing one can't make at home for a few dollars.  Greens, apple slices, a few figs and some bits of Rock cheese (or sub any blues).       Combined with the corkage, I thought it was overpriced and easily replicated for a portion of the cost.  Likewise, my friend had the Brie cheese appetizer, which was pretty much a big chunk of Brie served with bread and fruit.   It looked great, tasted great, but honestly is something one can put together after a shopping trip to TJs.    It's a charming place, nice staff and I can see how it's popular.  And as mentioned, I've only gone once so maybe the entrees will prove to be outstanding.

Pretty blah, really.    It's fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste.  The taco platter Jesse mentioned, is three street tacos on a styrofoam plate which has other little compartments filled with a a few spoonfuls of rice, beans, avocado sauce, and chopped lettuce.  They sprinkle a handful of chips over the top.  The meat isn't char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.  I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.    Not horrible, but also not worth the price.  The combos are $6.75 and drinks are extra ($2). so for $9 you get a pretty weak meal compared with other good/cheap Mexican places or decent sit down joints with service.

For me it was just OK. I'm a big fan of New Mexico style red vs. green chile sauce debates, so I was excited to see that this is one local place that seems to offer a lot of red/green choices. However while there's a decent mix of offerings, the sauces themselves were simply ho hum. Not bad, but not "wow." If you live near and need a Mex fix, this place would work for some of the basics, but not really a place to journey.  I did like the hominess factor, but service was a bit slow as well.

They hit you up for their credit card over and over.  Free shirt if you sign up in the terminal.  Skymall discount if you sign up during flight.  Endless letters offering free miles if you sign up via the mail.  So I did.  I was flying with them a lot for work, so I stopped using my company AMEX and began using my US Airways card for everything.  Then I got downsized.  And moved across country, while trying to sell my house in the worst market.  I've never not paid my bill, plus I stopped using it, but there was a bumpy patch where a few payments were a tad late.  I called and spoke with senior management, asking for a break.  Their response?  Something like: "Bite Me."  Followed with their bumping my interest rate to 30%.  Fast forward and I've almost paid it off and am now flying other airlines when possible.  Still, I do have to fly with them now and again.  And inevitably, during these flights, they annoyingly announce a deal to get their credit card and walk down the aisle, handing out applications.  I feel the need to stand up and warn people not to - but that type of behaviour gets you arrested these days.  But apparently usery doesn't.

Grabbed lunch there today - not near my normal stomping ground but it looked like a decent place so I took a chance.  Inside, clean and bright and a mix of biz people at lunch, local workers, some families.  Server was prompt, nice and spoke English fluently.  They brought out chips & salsa and the salsa was fantastic... fresh, home-made and had a nice kick.  I chose a $6.95 combo plate - taco, bean tostada and enchilada.  5 minutes after ordering it was served up.  What immediately stood out was everything was simple and light.  The taco wasn't greasy - just some tasty meat, lettuce and white cheese.  The tostada was similar - just a simple base with some really nice refried beans (def not from a can) and crispy lettuce/tomato and white cheese.  The enchilada was good as well.  I prefer  New Mexico style enchiladas, with a really hot sauce, so i rarely order them outside of NM because they are usually bland.  This had a red sauce that wasn't hot, but was definitely homemade and flavorful.   Overall it was pretty straightforward, simple, yet flavorful fare and seemed a lot less heavy/greasy than typical places.  And I'm often fine with greasy, though the beltline would disagree.  I'd defintely frequent the place if it was near, though it's not so special to merit an out-of-the-way trip.  It's a place where they care about making good grub and that shows.  If you're near or going to be in the area, it's worth exploring.

It's such a shame that this place is very unknown and tough to see.  The beer, scene and employees deserve a higher rating.  However the owners/management are lazy and unmotivated.  For example, they could petition the city and get a patio.  They could petition their property owner to help build out what could be a great beer garden on Scottsdale Rd.  But they choose to stay enclosed and undiscovered.  Likewise they seem to cherish the beer but have no food that relates.  Why not deliver some beer influenced grub?  Otherwise it's a nice place to visit or buy beer, but not a destination to eat or hang out with friends on the patio (which they don't have, unlike Four Peaks which is packed).

This is the McDonald's of Sushi... cheap, clean and efficient but pretty  blah food.   I can see people giving it a star higher for their happy hour deals, etc. but if talking about the quality of the main focus - the food - it's 2 star.   Tuna roll - overwhelming vinegar taste. Not sure if this was the fish or rice. It made me question the freshness.   Spicy scallops looked like cream corn and tasted like mayo + sriracha sauce. The rice and nori were bone dry - so much so that I separated them and only ate the scallop part.   Salmon skin rolls - The grilled skin should have been the star but got muddled with crab meat and other fillings in a very skinny roll.   And these were pretty basic selections - not the fancy rolls with 32 ingredients. That said, they weren't awful - but simply nothing memorable. It's similar to RA or Kona - an inviting space, good happy hour deals, etc. But if you want good fare, check out the higher rated places around town where the food is the star.

This review is based strictly on their burgers.  Why?  I had just downloaded the Yelp mobile app and Harlow's was among the top burger search results for Tempe.  I know it's a great breakfast/sandwich/diner type place, but had never thought of it as a burger destination, until the Yelp mobile results.  So I headed on over.  Here's what I found:  It's not a burger destination.     They offer 5 or so, starting with a basic burger, then different variations based on toppings... green chile, texas chile, bacon focused, etc.  I kept with the basic, plus cheese.  For $8 you get the basic burger with fries, and the variations bump it another dollar or two.  Drinks are extra.    The menu said theirs were char grilled, but I think they are steam table cooked - no char or smokey taste on mine.  Likewise, I appreciate the regular menu featuring a lot of local product sources,  but I'd guess these are from a frozen patty national vendor.  It wasn't bad, but it reminded me of many tailgates where we bought the big pack of frozen patties and simply reheated and cooked them on a grill.  The service was good and fast.  The fries were decent, though nothing unique (also from a frozen bag?).  The bun was ok, and it came with pickle, onion and lettuce.  But it's still unclear if they made them there or used an external source for the patty.    Bottom line:  After tip, I paid $12 for a burger, fires and coke.  There was no "wow moment."  If they produced something unique it might be worth it.  As it stands, I'd definitely recommend the place for other things, but not burgers. It's not their forte.

I hate giving 5 starts, but this is one of those places that elevates cuisine and deserves it.  This has nothing to do with being fancy or pricey.  Simply, the fare here is elevated,  People seek Mexican, but for those seeking authentic Mexican, this is a place that serves fare that isn't about tacos or burritos.  Instead, it's about real food done with Mexican flair, spices and sauces.  Here, you will fall in love with chicken for how its prepared with sauces.  Here, you fall in love with guacamole because they throw in some twists.  In other words, they serve dishes that you'd have a really tough time trying to make at home.  To me, that's a good restaurant.

Rating is for the food.  I love the space, decor, the outdoor grill/tortilla cooks, etc.  However the food is simply blah.  I was there when it opened and have been back about 8 times now and it seems the food is progressively more ho hum, which is odd since they aren't serving blue hair seniors from Iowa.  I just returned from a meal with east coasters unfamiliar with good Mexican and they even thought it was bland.  They also loved the whole look and feel... just not the food.  It's a shame, since this really could be a regional gem where you take visitors (and locals who rarely leave their burbs) and really wow them.  I keep going back because the next door market is also one of those unique-to-PHX experiences.  However Tradiciones is not delivering on the food.  The menu sounds good.  It looks good.  It tastes like buffet fare - dumbed down for the masses.   If only they brought in some recipes and/or cooks from any number of divey but great tasting places nearby, it could be so much better... and that's the shame.

My chiropractor is next door, not to mention Dukes, so I've noticed and walked by this place many, many times but never ventured in.  My mistake.  It epitomizes what's best in local, passionate retail ownership and is worth a trip if that's worthy to you.    It's not big or fancy.  They aren't catering to the person wanting the $20 block of Ginsu knives, but they also wouldn't turn you away if you came in looking.  It's simply a great place to explore a refined selection of professional quality chef's knives - which is clearly their passion.  Most people are content with whatever knife is readily available, but for those who cook professionally - the right knife is as critical as a tennis racquet  for Federer or a golf club to Mickelson... natural extensions to their physical skill sets.  A good knife doesn't make you better, but simply betters what you do.  When I visited, there were several well known chefs, looking for a new favorite tool, and I loved how they were as passionate about the design and fit as a car collector might be when it comes to craftsmanship.  The feel in the hand, blade length, metallurgy, composite materials... all were factors.   The owner was happy to spread dozens of choices on the counter, helping each buyer zoom in on what fit them best.  When it was my turn, I was clueless, but he steered me the right way.  In my case, I'm not a chef but have spent many months in kitchens, doing sexy deeds like chopping up cases of onions.  So I love a good knife.  And what I've since forgotten is how well a sharp knife makes a home cook's life better.   You can go in with $40 or $400 and they'll find the best product for your price range.  And if you don't want to buy, they'll sharpen your existing stuff.

I agree with Than.  Quite often I'm dismayed by the blahness of many local Mex joints.  Considering how many we have and our proximity to the border, it's amazing how average most places tend to be.  Las Brazas is a notch higher.  It's not a place to go for margs with friends, or a special outing... you pour your own Pepsi here and watch soccer on TV as the jukebox blares Mariachi music.  But the food is good, plentiful and seems to be cooked by someone wanting to be a little different.  Again, it's a strip mall place and not a dining destination... but if you like Mex food, are in the area, and simply want a decent meal - it'll fit the bill.  Also love the free chips and salsa bar!

Grabbing a "to go" meal to eat on a plane is an increasingly smarter tactic than relying on an airline who may/may not be offering something decent on any particular flight.  But airport choices are often limited to pizza/burger chains or fancy sandwiches that really aren't that fancy.  So while changing planes and terminals in Charlotte, I happened to wheel by this place and thought I'd give some Carolina BBQ a try (when in Rome).     They've got a combo meal with choice of meat and 2 sides, so I went with pulled pork, beans and slaw, and they threw in a fried pickle and corn bread as well.  Up in the air, between NC and PHX, I opened the platter and the smell of BBQ'd meat, sides and cornbread almost started a mini-riot among fellow passengers.   The pork was well cooked, with both bark and pinkness, and could be eaten politely with a fork in the confines of an airline seat (ribs would be tricky/messy).  The sauce had the Carolina vinegar zing - with some heat - and the sides were solid.   It was like enjoying a really good backyard BBQ, but in the middle of an Airbus 320 at 35,000 feet.    Debating great BBQ is like debating Pizza... everyone has their favorite styles and many will never be happy outside of their faves.  All I can say is this particular meal tasted great to me, and what's even better is that it's found in an airport terminal food court.  Which brings up an interesting caveat to this Yelp review...  I'm not even sure one can eat here unless inside the secured area of the airport.  That is, if you happen to be walking around the streets of Charlotte looking for chow, you can't (or can't easily) pop into this location without a boarding pass.  Likewise, if you happen to be flying through Charlotte (a major connector hub), you likely wouldn't have time to actually roam the streets of Charlotte and have other choices of Carolina BBQ... so reviews of this place should be engaged in this context.             Bottom line from me:  if you happen to be passing through this airport, looking to grab something to eat in the terminal or take on the plane, this is both a good and unique choice.  It got an extra star from me because the home cooked style made me forget - if only for a spell - that I was crammed into a coach seat for the next 4 hours.

I chose the BBQ chicken salad, which our server said was top notch and his fave item.  My friends got burgers and slider meals.    What I got was salad greens topped with battered, deep fried, blah tasting chicken fingers,  cut into pieces, and a bunch of BBQ sauce dumped on top.  Say what?  It's a great looking place and probably cost millions... can't they grill up some fresh chicken rather than serve bagged/frozen/breaded stuff?    The burgers got ok reviews, though the fries were of the heavily seasoned type that get old after 5.  The friend didn't like the pulled pork sliders.  Overall it was pretty blah, chain-like food that when coupled with drinks, makes for an overpriced, underwhelming experience.

Been meaning to try this place for a while and swung by for lunch while running some errands.  Delish.  I won't write a whole review as I've only been once and had a lunch special.  The menu seems to be very pan-Asian influenced, with bold flavors.  If you like heat, ask for the side chile sauces, which you can mix in and increase to your desired level of pow.  The owners were incredibly nice and I'm afraid their lease is up, so it remains to be seen if they stay put.  If you like Asian food, give them some business... I think it would be a great place to take friends and share a bunch of dishes.

A definite gem.   We split an order of veal cannelloni in pink (vodka?) sauce, which were beautifully flavorful and surprisingly light. We also shared a medium pizza - the name escapes me but it was tomato sauce, mozz, some nice sausage with a kick and... broccoli. I can't recall ever having that on a pizza - but it worked. In fact I'd imagine most things cooked in a wood fired oven on a great crust works pretty well. Coupled with the delish bread/caponata dish, we ate very well. And there are a few slices left over in the fridge.   I know some people aren't fans of the location, size, etc. but some of my fave places in other cities are in the most unexpected areas, strip malls, etc. and you have to give the owner props for taking a chance on a spot that would defy any advice from pricey consultants and created a small, but great chow experience.

D'Arcy McGee's is like a beauty contestant... nice to look at but inept when it comes to basic talents.  On several visits the service has either been slow, bad or downright invisible.   The food is avg. at best, and definitely reflects the corporate chain mentality behind the place.  It's as much and Irish/Celtic pub experience as Outback is a celebration of Australian fare.

Went for lunch with a friend.  I had the Bhatinda lamb special. Very good.   The portion was modest (but fine for the avg. appetite in context with the other stuff), and the price included naan, rice, and a couple of other sides.  My friend ordered a vindaloo dish, which was a tad more in price and was just the curry. For him, the rice/naan was an add-on. It was a larger serving, but I think he felt a tad confused due to the different offerings included in my order.   Also, he felt it was pretty mild, though the menu and waiter mentioned it would be spicy hot. We mentioned this to the manager and he said that requesting more heat was an easy thing for them to do. So if you like to sweat when eating vindaloo (and other Indian fare), just be sure to make it clear when ordering.   In any case, it was a first visit so I'm not sure which are the best things to order and if ordering a combination - what is the best plan. I would venture to guess, however, that it would be a great place to go with a small group, then order a variety of things and share.

It's basically an Asian themed mini mall anchored by a 40,000 square foot supermarket. A friend and I swung by this Sunday and did a walkabout. When I say mini mall, it's part strip mall, part regular mall, with outside facing shops but also an internal strolling area.   In any case, it's just now populating with tenants. There looks to be a future-planned indoor food court promising a mix of Indian and SE Asian fare. There are also several sit down restaurants already in full swing... offering Taiwanese, general Vietnamese fare and a Pho-specific dishes.   The market is great. They too had a food court - though more like an Asian (3 item + rice or noodle) buffet. Overall the market is somewhat similar to Lee Lees and the 99 Ranch in the Chinese Cultural Center, though it seemed their produce, seafood and butcher areas are more abundantly stocked. The prices are nice as well - a batch of shitake mushrooms, for example, is $1.50ish which might cost 4 times that in a fancy gourmet grocer.   Regardless, if you are a fan of eating or cooking Asian fare, it's definitely a must visit. I should say S.E. Asian as it seems more Vietnamese/Chinese focused while Asia is a huge continent. In any case, it's a welcomed addition to the growing mix of of ethnic places in the metro area.

The key to this place is the meat is cooked over fire, which only a few "taco shop" type places in greater Phoenix bother to do, and it imparts a different flavor to the meat. For $5.95, my burrito with loaded with tasty carne asada and little else... no beans or rice fillers - just good beef, not dry or grissely, nor mushy/steamed. It contained some pico de gallo and guac, though I didn't notice any guac until the last few bites (must have loaded one end).   The biggest negative for me is paying extra for chips and salsa, especially when the chips come from a local store (and aren't that good). Also, don't go if in a hurry - it's a popular place and a small kitchen, so it can take a short while for orders to come up.   Overall, some might get annoyed with the parking, waits, add-ons, etc. but if you like grilled asada, they do it better than most in PHX.

I've only been once and therefore my experience is limited.  But I'll be back.  Great service. The folks who work here are good.  I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the simplest bruschetta combo, which is kind of a misnomer as they offer a lot of things served on bread.  I had their steak.  I had their salmon.  Both were great, tasty portions.  I'd be back, but I just moved to NY where this would fit in nicely.  Hope they franchise!

I agree with others who thought it's a tad overpriced.  A group of us on a Sunday bike ride (the pedal kind) had a pit stop there and for some reason they have happy hour every day of the week - except Sundays.  Spring training season was over so the place was barely a quarter full on a lazy afternoon.  It's a nice place, but 3 domestic beers + tax/tip cost $18.   I'd expect to pay that at a club at night, but it's not a place I'd stop by again during the day for a casual bev with friends.  For some reason, a lot of Old Town places don't seem to realize there's a big difference between the day crowd and the night crowd.
