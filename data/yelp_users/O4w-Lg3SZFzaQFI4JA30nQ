Came here to eat with my fiancé and brother-in-law. But that didn't happen since the kitchen is closed. Maybe if someone who worked here actually picked up the phone. We would of known that and not wasted a 40min drive. We called a number of times to find out when the kitchen closes...Why so dont you add to the website or even the number that is listed right times for things here.

We just moved to the Glendale area.. My fiancé and my mom were craving Chinese food... So after all these mixed reviews on yelp we decided to go give it a shot.  Ok so we orders egg drop soup which was delish. An order of egg rolls omg they reminded me of the egg rolls you would get from nj/nyc. We also got lo mein, orange chicken, shrimp in lobster sauce, garlic chicken and moo goo gai pan with chicken. Tasted unbelievable so much flavor not too greasy.  They give you such huge portions that it look like we barely touched any of the food so now we have leftovers for the next day.  Amazing spot a must try !!!

I'm from nj/nyc so I'm already a snot when it comes to pizza and anything Italian.. We just moved to Glendale from ca.. Which CA has shitty pizza lol.. And we have a restaurant by our old home called NYPD(looks just like the one here).. Anyway we came here for dinner ordered the mozzarella. the kids a small half cheese/pepperoni. we got a small Wall Street. Have to say it's petty tasty I wasn't disappointed... We will be back to try other foods on the menu  Might be our new spot for some yummy pizza

Nothing like the soup salad and breadsticks. We never actually sat down and waited for a table because for some reason there is always away so we go straight to the bar since we know we're going to get faster service that way. Yeah we are nondrinkers but still going to the bar is a Way faster service to get our favorite breadsticks lol I absolutely love coming to this Olive Garden the staff at the bar are so attentive they're so funny also the managers always come over and talk to us. We've never had a bad meal everything we have had so far tasty super yummy we always try new specials that they have. we're on the rewards program so we gets a little perks like a free appetizer or free dessert. Definitely can't beat that

Worst customer service... I went in for a fill I had one broken nail and a few that were chipped it says $14 for a fill she wanted to charge me $23 uhhh why bc you actually have to work and make my nails look how I want ??? Then some other lady comes over and try's to say I need a new set. no I don't... I do hair and my sister-in-law does my nails usually(I just moved to az sooo she can't do them for me anymore).. I was so annoyed I actually walked out and went across to the street to another nail shop had my nails done with no extra charge or pushing for a new set. Pretty sure I won't come back to this nail shop.

I've been shopping around for my wedding dress I came in with pictures and a budget. I walked in and was greeted by Brittany and Tammy. Who listened to what I wanted pay attention to every detail and the best part stated within my budget. I tried on a few but kept going back to this one special one that had everything and more. Overall I did buy a dress. I said yes to the dress   I would say if you are looking for the perfect wedding dress and a bridal store that listens to your needs this is the place !!!! Don't listen to these one star reviews I've had the best time today and I can't wait to be married !!!!!

I would give more stars BUT my pedi was beyond the worst pedi I've ever had in my many years of getting my nails and toes done ... The worst and the fastest pedi ever!!! No leg massage no warm towel. She was done in 10min such a shitty place never again. But I did get a fill in my nails and the lady who did them she did such a great job. But I will only come here for my fills and not a pedi I'll Find another place that does it right

So we just moved to the Glendale area. And I have to have Starbucks every day like a religiously. I love this Starbucks and the location it's so close to target. This has to be one of the most fancies Starbucks we have ever been to. They have a huge selection of snacks and treats which one day we will try the most we ever get is bagel or a cake pop for our son and my fiancé usually just get a bacon cheddar sandwich. Along with our iced coffee.. Which they never mess up.  Top of everything else the staff here are so friendly they always have a smile on their face you're greeted you feel welcome and it's just a great atmosphere all together!!!

This movie theater makes you feel so spoiled when coming to the moves. Not only can we walk here but we love the lazyboy chairs and many choir of cola we can pick. It's nice you pick ur seats tons of room you don't have to worry about some idiot hitting the back of ur chair during a movie. Another perk is on Tuesdays movies are $6.00 for customer appreciation day! Which means you must have an AMC rewards card..  Love coming here
