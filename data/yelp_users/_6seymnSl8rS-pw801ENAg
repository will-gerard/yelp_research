Always busy, but i'm a fan of their Monday and Tuesday board/bottle deal.. plus their bruscetta is probably the best i've had here in town.

I asked a friend of mine if she had a good dermatologist, and she goes to Camelback Derm.  I made an appointment (dealing with mild acne), and was optimistic for some new treatment as well as to get a prescription for a topical I had already been using.  I knew going into it I would be seeing a PA first and then meet the doctor.  I made it clear on both the written forms they have you fill out as a new patient and verbally stated to the PA that I have an autoimmune disorder and cannot take certain medications with antibiotics.  I met the doctor for only 5 minutes.  i was still given a prescription for a topical with an antibiotic in it and when i got home, after doing more research, it was highly suggested on many websites (including the drug company's) to not use this medication because of my autoimmune disorder.  This was the first frustrating issue.  I called the doctors office and left a message with the nurse's line, and they did call back pretty quickly saying they would change the prescription.  While it was nice that the doctor gave me samples and coupons for the prescriptions, one of them was expired, and could not use it at the pharmacy (though I did end up later finding one online through the drug company).  I also found that frustrating-but only because it costed me an extra half an hour of going back and forth to the pharmacy.  Overall, I felt most bothered by the fact that I expressed more than once that I have this pre-existing condition that should be taken into consideration, and the neither the PA nor the doctors seemed to take notice.  I do understand that this doctors office is very large and busy, but being that I was a new patient to the office, I felt very rushed.  But, this office location is very convenient to where I live, and for the most part do not have many other skin problems to deal with, so I don't plan on having to go to this office very often, other than to follow up on my progress with these medications.

The first time I went to Sushi 101 was probably almost 6 years ago, so I dont remember the experience.  The second time I went to Sushi 101 I will not forget my unenjoyable service!  The waitress we had seemed exhausted and like she did not want to be there.  While we were rushing to get our order in before Happy Hour ended, she seemed overwhelmed.  We had already knew what we wanted, made the order clear and concise, but she seemed irritated to have to hurry.  The biggest issue my party and I had while there was that, after a problem wtih my order (she ordered the wrong roll), she ignored our table for the rest of the time we were there until my new order came out!  When I told her my order was not correct, she made it clear that she would have to pay for the mistake--I'm sorry it is coming out of your paycheck, but you made the mistake in the system!  She did not refill our drinks the entire time we were there, and made me feel as though the mistake was my fault.  All she could do was split the price of the roll that I had not wanted, which I dont understand why a restaurant would have that policy, instead of just clearing it from my tab.  I dont think I will return to Sushi 101!

The space is pretty small so it gets crowded. And while I don't order any crazy fancy sushi, for some reason the Philadelphia roll I usually get did not taste as good at this location compared to the biltmore location.  But their Las Vegas roll was good.

So you would think this place has it down when it comes to large parties because the only time I have ever come here (and have seen many times) is for large get togethers.  Well, they came sort of close...  I have worked in a restaurant as a server, so I always try to give the server the benefit of the doubt.  I know that it is extremely stressful serving large parties, takes much longer, and can generally stress you out.  Our server appeared to be finishing up with a very large party of about 20 women when he started with us.  Ok, I'll give him that.. it took quite some time between the time we sat to the time we ordered drinks, got our drinks, and then placed our food order (about 20 minutes).  It took another 30 minutes before our table got our salads/soups... and then ANOTHER 30-40 minutres after soups/salads were served until we got our food.  By the time we got our food, we were tired, not that hungry, and a little irritated.  Plus, I don't think the food is worth THAT long of wait.  To rate the food/drinks: -Mom said her martini was just OK... should have been served more chilled. -salads were heavy on the dressing, but good. -Main dishes were good, good quality food... but side of angel hair pasta dishes were too dry.  Our server did apologize stating that there were many other problems tonight in the kitchen, hence the long wait.. but who knows if that is true (I may or may not have used that line a time or two as a server...) And he did redeem for the long wait by providing us 2 free desserts to take home (cheesecake was yum!)  I guess my biggest complaint, while also trying to be understanding of the fact that this place is so insanely busy, was the general attitude I felt from the staff we interacted with.  From the hostess to the manager helping the hostess to the server... I felt as a server, they were not emitting the kind of welcoming attitude that should be given at a restaurant.  Yes, I know it is jam-packed in your restaurant and people are probably complaining up the wahzoo about waiting for a table.  But the experience the staff creates for a restaurant is usually what gets me wanting to come back!  Another tip--be prepared to talk loudly when you go.. it is very noisy!  And dark.

I come here every so often. It's within 30 seconds of my moms house, so i like the location   The prices are comparable for the experience. The atmosphere is relaxed and pretty. I like their boutique items and have bought a few other things there.  The last gel manicure I got turned out really well. I love the square shape, and the nail tech offered to do loose glitter instead of a gel polish (for my ring finger accent nail), which is fun.   I don't like that they charge $8 for gel removal if my last gel manicure wasn't from them. I don't mind the little up charge, but $8 seems a little too high for me.  I'll be back though, I enjoyed having Shannon do my nails!

I usually like this place but was a little disappointed this last time. I tried the eggs Benedict and did not like their own made hollandaise sauce. Next time I'm sticking with my usual blueberry pancakes. Boyfriend liked his meal (he had the wolf pack). Service was good. We got in quickly for a busy Memorial Day Monday morning. Unfortunately we both got sick later in the day and it was the only meal we had eaten so I'm going to be a little hesitant next time I think about going to over easy.

I want to like this place but just cannot find reason in how overpriced the services are.   I received a $50 gift card for my birthday and since I'm not a fan of cheapy nail salons, I was really looking forward to a fun gel manicure at a nice salon.   Well this appointment was disappointing. I knew I was going to be paying a good deal, but for $55 dollars I would expect more than just filing my nails and painting them. Oh I did get a simple lotion hand massage... The manicure would have been $50 but the lose glitter on my two ring finger nails was seriously an extra $5. Seems ridiculous for just 2 fingers.   My nail technician was nice and friendly, but the paint job was a little sloppy with some uneven lines at my nail beds and air bubbles.   I wouldn't normally come to this salon. I was also in a few years ago when the groupon first came out to get my hair colored. I thought it was overpriced even with a groupon.

Loved this place!  I went for lunch after my graduation.  We went for a very late lunch so it was dead, which was fine with me.  We had a great server, who was accomodating and friendly.  The mac and cheese was SO GOOD, definitely get that if you go.  We also had the grilled artichokes.. very yummy.  Everyone's lunch was good, and I thought was really reasonably priced for 5 people (3 ordered the kobe burgers, a bottle of champagne, and two appetizers) when the total came out to $115 bucks.  They also provided a free celebration dessert, which was such a nice personal touch.  Food = yummy, decor = adorable, service = excellent.

While the place could use a small remodel to spruce up the place, it definitely feels like an art house or indie film cinema. The bar is small but there is plenty of seating to enjoy a glass of wine or beer before your movie. The theater is also small but cozy. Me and the boyfriend had a fun time last Saturday night seeing a very obscure comedy. I would definitely go back!

Sooo yummy!!! and very friendly employees that are energetic and fun.  The ice cream is creamy and creative.  The mint one is a favorite.  The almond joy-also delicious.  They have creative menu items that you can follow by the board or add your own twist.  The ice cream sandwiches are good--but Churn, if you're listening! The chocolate chip cookies have a little too much salt on them! I know the salted desserts are popular these days, but the cookie was a little too salty!

Great service - though I just came in for an oil change. They have a good Yelp deal. I just scheduled my next oil change so I'm a returning customer for location and quality. I understand the need to schedule an appointment but I wish I could simply pull up any time without one. But I will keep coming back!

I had the best time!! I went with 3 other girlfriends as an alternative idea to bridal shower celebrations.  The package included a glass of wine/beer, which is definitely great! The overall instruction was so easy to follow and the instructor was super entertaining too! Great music, fun environment, and friendly staff.  We all had a good time!  We got our paintings done and were able to chat like girls do.  Definitely plan on returning for my birthday!

Yummy brunch! The hollandaise sauce was really good. $12 bottomless mimosas! Service was friendly. A little slow but it was Mother's Day, so it was busy!   The patio was lovely and spacious. And dog-friendly!  We have also been for wine and tapas. Great atmosphere for a date night!

Thought the burgers were pretty good! Usually not a fan of old town crowd, but this felt more low key and relaxed.  Also had good service, even though it was kind of hard to hear our waiter with the loud music. Dessert was yummy and drinks were good too.  I would return for sure!

I purchased the introductory groupon they offered a few weeks ago, and was hesitant at first because I haven't had the greatest experiences using groupons.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I did look at some of the bad yelp reviews before going in, which made me nervous! So for those of you that only look at bad reviews, I hope you see this one and have a little more hope.  I had a stylist named Annie, she had pink hair.  Super friendly, and really appeared to want to get my style right.  Since I had read bad reviews before coming in about stylists not listening to the customer when they asked for the curling iron to be used for better curl, I was concerned she would do the same.  But, I let her know I was looking for good curl, and with thin/straight hair, it can be tricky to achieve.  She attempted to curl with just the round brush and hair dryer first, and when she was "impressed by her curling abilities with a round brush," she was "equally impressed with my hair's inability to hold a curl." So she broke out the curling iron!  We made great small talk, and I let her know I would be back in a month when I go out to celebrate my birthday.  The salon is a fun, well-decorated environment.  It was pretty loud with the hair dryers going, but not terrible.  The less than perfect rating was that I saw people with mimosas/champagne, and while I had been offered something to drink, I figured I could just choose water or coffee, as that is usually is what at hair salons, I wasn't informed of my choices by the front desk staff.  Now I know for next time to ask for some bubbly!  Another good tip is to plan for longer than 45 minutes if you are planning to do a style with curls.  While I got started on my appointment about 5-10 minutes late, I was there for 1 hour (and I dont have super long, thick hair that takes a great deal of time).  I will be back in January for my 25th birthday night!

Good decor, love the location. Being jewish, I love a good bagel and shmear ;) I was bummed they were out of everything bagels when I arrived at 11 am on a Saturday, only to have fresh ones made right after I got my order! Darn! Decent prices, and will be back!

Tried this place late one night after a long day at work.  I wanted a burger, but did not want fast food.  I remembered the The Stand (and remembered reading good reviews on Yelp) had just opened, so I went through the drive thru.  Ordered burger, fries, chick taco and short rib taco, and a drink.  I pulled around to the window, got my soda, and waited.... and then one of the workers came up and asked if I wanted a drink while I was waiting.  I thanked him, said I had a drink... and then 2 minutes later, I was offered by another worker a free lemonade to try!  Awesome!  They were so friendly, which made the little bit of the wait not so bad.  It did take about 8-10 minutes, which is long for a drive thru, but it is good food and it was clear that it was made fresh.  The burger was good, I'd recommend this burger.  Fries were definitely the end-of-the-day fries but it was 9pm, so it's understandable and they were not too bad.  My mom liked her tacos, I tried them, and they were good quality.  Overall, I would recommend, and I would go back for sit down.

I have to update to add the extra star for the great customer service I had at the most recent trip to The Stand.  We were greeted with enthusiasm and excitement, personable and friendly... Top notch for staff!  The food was de-lish and fantastic as usual.  I had the chocolate milkshake...seriously, AMAZING.  They've also worked on their speediness for to-go orders! I'll definitely be thinking of this place when i want a quick, higher-quality-than-Wendy's burgers!

Yum!   Loved the atmosphere and menu!   Was even busy on a Friday mid morning!! I can just imagine how packed the place can be on weekends. Good service, and easy parking.   Got the breakfast special-scrambled eggs with spinach and sausage. Hash browns were a little different, Kinda mushy. I will be trying the country potatoes next time. Friend had the salami scramble. Also delish! And good size portions! We had left overs to take home.    Will be back for sure!

YUM!  I am huge breakfast fan, and the food is delicious.  The first time I went for a birthday brunch on a Saturday morning, there was a very long wait-I won't deny that it was annoying, but us midtown/Arcadia folks love our bunches! ;) We were told a 90 minute wait (!) but it was more of a 30 minute wait. Even then, we did wait quite a bit for the food, plus some of our orders were messed... but, all was made up when we weren't charged for the mistakes PLUS a  $25 gift card!! All was made right! Pancakes were delish!!  Second time we went during the week for a brunch/lunch, with no wait. And friendly service.  Eggs benedict were ahhmazing!  Check it out, but be prepared for the wait on weekends!

Meh.. its all i can say.  I went here because of the rave reviews, but i didn't see anything special about it, and I've had better.  I also waited over 45 minutes past my appointment time because they were understaffed that day.. i get that people call out and i have patience and forgiveness.. but may offer 10% off for the long wait? that would have me coming back for sure.  the one thing that i really liked about this place is that the nail tech opened a new tool package before getting to work on my nails, so i appreciate cleanliness!

It was a nice small local joint, with a fun ambiance. The tacos were really yummy (we had the basics-pork, beef, chicken). The margarita was nothing special, but not over priced. Friendly staff and the food came out pretty quickly. It's great since we live down the street! Great addition to the neighborhood!

We went last week and would go back! We had the Greek salad with chicken, and a steak pita. Both were good and recommended. A little pricey for a casual feeling restaurant. We want to go back to try the pizza since we live so close!
