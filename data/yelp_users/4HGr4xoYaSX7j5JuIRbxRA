Drive thru was fine. I ordered the pot pie but wasn't fond of it - just a personal opinion - my coworker loves it. The corn bread is tasty. I'll try something else next time.

Just wanted to update that I've tried the pot pie again and really like it. It's so fresh, I love the crust and it hits the spot.

How disappointing - the tech couldn't have been less interested in doing her job. She spent one minute per foot removing dead skin and callus removal. Barely touched my cuticles. I just kept thinking about how I'd do it myself when I got home. I got the $39 DELUXE pedi - what a joke. Don't waste your money or time. I left with dead skin on my toes and calluses on the balls of my feet. Very disappointing.

Got there right before 7 p.m. for a simple cut, I was checked in, sat down and watched 3 employees visiting and goofing around amongst each other with no interest in cutting my hair. Now I realize I'm a walk in and maybe they're waiting for an appointment customer, but perception is they didn't care that a new customer was observing their uninterested behavior.  If one of them had told me that someone would help me momentarily,  I'd have been pacified, but sitting there awkwardly, while they're doing nothing, wasn't impressive. I got up and left after 20 minutes. They had my phone number and could have called to follow up, etc., but they didn't bother. Oh well, they're loss. I'm a great tipper. It's really a shame for the owner of this establishment to lose a new customer who would have referred her friends.

Very creepy experience. Waste of $35 on lousy pedicure. I was the only customer - that should tell you something. I know the kid doing my pedicure wasn't licensed. He was awful. Wouldn't even talk to me just pointed and shrugged. Just a horrible pedicure and awkward experience.

Top notch place for pet lovers. I have Wayne to thank for hooking me up with my newly adopted Chihuahua "Tiffany" - she's stolen my heart. I adopted her through One Dog Arizona which visits, with pets in tow, the Choice Pet Market in Chandler. They so kindly not only gave me a starter bag of Grandma Mae's Country Naturals for Tiffany, but also gave me a bag of special blend for my overweight Chihuahua, Rosco. They love this food. I'll be back for more of the personalized attention my pets receive for their special needs. Great place to do business!

I love this store. I shop here quite a bit. It's a "help yourself" store but that's fine by me. There is usually a clerk at the register but that's about it. I even got a credit card for this store. The prices are fantastic and they usually offer me deals with my credit card. You can't go wrong here. They have great clearance racks too. I highly recommend this store.

Best pedicure I've ever received. I was a walk-in and only waited about 15 minutes while my feet were soaking. The pedicure was thorough and oh so soothing. I got the Signature pedi for $33. Worth every penny. I'm so happy I found this place.

It does the trick. I'm here at least once a week. My only complaint is the employees want me to pull in directly behind a vehicle and I'm so close it makes me nervous that I'm going to hit the car ahead of me or get rear-ended. I wish they'd give more space.
