I am sad.  This used to be my favorite coffee shop.  Without reservation, I would have told you this was the best mocha I've ever had.  Not anymore.  Today, I ordered a mocha.  I routinely get tastier ones at Starbucks.  The barista either used too much milk or not enough chocolate powder, or they changed the chocolate they used.  Either way, it wasn't chocolaty, or even sweet.  It was really... bleh.  Not only that, but when I asked for whipped cream (which I never had to ask for before,) the barista went to pull a can out of the fridge.  They no longer make their own amazing, tasty, homemade whipped cream.  They put something like Reddi-whip on your drink.  It was really hot inside there, as well.  I truly hope that I just went there on a bad day.  I hope that they're not cutting corners (on things like air conditioning!) and reducing the quality of their product.  Their quality was what set them apart from Starbucks.  But today, I realized that I paid more for a mocha and enjoyed it far less than I would have from a major chain.  At least Starbucks makes their own whipped cream.

I LOVE this place.  Are the hours too short?  Yes.  Would I prefer a larger, more central location? Of course.  But, unless the prices are jacked to the sky, I will keep going there for the food and the philosophy.    The croissants are, bar-none, the best in the valley.  No joke.  They are buttery, flakey, flavorful (my mouth is watering as I write this) and worth twice what I pay for them.  The chocolate croissants are heaven on a plate.  I will say that I was slightly disappointed in the almond croissant, not because it wasn't good, but because it was too sweet compared to the plan or chocolate ones.    I love my mochas, as well, and they have a great one here.  I highly recommend it with one caveat: the mocha is perfectly sweetened UNLESS you eat a sweet item before it.  Therefore, when buying both a chocolate croissant and a mocha (which I often do,) either drink the mocha first, or eat the croissant and wait before tasting the mocha.  Trust me, they are both delicious if eaten correctly :)  The macaroons are amazing!  I prefer the creamy ones (hazelnut, vanilla, caramel, dulce de leche, pumpkin) but some people prefer the fruity ones with jam in them.  The chocolate has a fudgy, not creamy filling.  It's still good, but it's not what I was expecting.  As I said, their philosophy is awesome.  They buy local and organic, compost, use sustainable resources and recycle.  What can I say?  It's everything I want in a restaurant!  Try to avoid this place at lunch because it is CRAZY busy.  But tasty, tasty, tasty.

My birth was just about perfect with Shell.  Caring, warm, and wonderful.  I actually cried about a week after having my baby because he'd no longer be part of my weekly routine.

What a gem!  This place is a little hidden in the same shopping center as Lee Lee's Asian market, so I had to really look to find it.    We had the egg and vegetable noodle soup, the fried dumplings and the chicken fried noodles.  You can really tell that they make their own noodles.  Delicious!  Don't let the picture on the menu fool you, their portions are HUGE!    I have to second the comments about the amazing service.  Everyone was prompt and polite, and I love that I could see into the kitchen as my noodles were made.  I now have firsthand knowledge of how clean their kitchen is.    I would not hesitate to recommend this place to someone wanting Chinese food that's authentic and a little out of the norm!

Everything pickled and everything pork!  Try the charcuterie!  The bread is flavorful and fresh, and trying everything else on the plate is a veritable adventure.  The croque Monsieur is among the most delicious things I've ever tasted, and the worst part of dessert is narrowing your choices down to one!  The cookie was amazing, and next time I'll be trying the chocolate cake.  Seriously, any restaurant that offers pork belly as a side is a foodie dream.  Beer selection was small, but interesting and good.
