Made an appointment at 350.  They close at 4 apparently.  So I get there and they had to cancel and reschedule because the doctor left. So why make the appointment that close to closing time? I'll update after my appointment but this is definitely not a good start.

So I was a little hesitant about coming here because I didn't see any great reviews on google and menu prices were high. We get there and it literally took over an hour to get our food. I ordered a bread board and nachos. Bread board was good which is why I gave 2 stars but the nachos...Geeze they should not be called nachos I paid $6 for a tiny bowl of potatoe chips with very gross, COLD cheese (if I could even call it cheese) I have a pic attached so you can see for yourself. I only ate like 2 chips and had my friends try too, they weren't pleased.  My friend ordered wings which tasted like plain chicken and they were suppose to be spicy. Those were also not hot. Another friend ordered steak and eggs medium and got rare. I do give props to the waitress she tried really hard to fix the situation,  but often it took her a while to even get to the table which is why I think our food took so long. would not recommend this place, overpriced and food is not good.

Michelle is awesome! I get my eyebrows threaded every once in a while. She does an amazing job. She is super friendly and very accommodating. She also gave me a 15 min massage once (as part of a promo) it felt great!  I haven't had the chance to set up a full massage appointment but will be doing it soon . Definitely recommend her
