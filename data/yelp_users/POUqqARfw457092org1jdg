So, imagine a movie theater that may have been the gem of Phoenix, constructed in about 1977.  You'd have mirrored ceilings, Aztec-ish bronze doors, and crystal shafts falling from above the concession stand like something out of the Superman Movies. A disco palace made especially for the silver screen.  Definitely, this was one of the coolest movie theaters of Phoenix, in the day. I can imagine seeing the Empire Strikes Back here, and loving every second.  Fast forward 30 years, and we have the Silver Cinemas, a discount ($3.00) second-run theater. All of the mirrors, glass, and inner illuminated crystals are all there, and are still quite a spectacle, if you like to travel back in time.  My first time I strode into the lobby, I was smiling like Billy Dee Williams.  I've been to a few dollar theaters in my days, and they all show signs of decay. Face it, they're not pulling in the big bucks in this very difficult business.  Silver Cinemas is little different, with signs of wear and tear evident if you look close enough. However, when I attended with my son recently, the place was clean and the help was doing their job.   The movie (or the projector?) itself showed a good deal of scratches and wear, though I found it easy to forget about after the first few minutes of the film. Also, my first chair was at a funky angle, so I moved to another, and all was grand.  Since we were seeing the second run of what is a modern B-movie, there were only a few others in the little screening room with us, which was kinda nice. I didn't feel so bad when my 6 yr old had some loud reactions to what he was seeing on screen.  MINUSES: - Semi comfortable seating compared to modern theaters - Drinks and popcorn still expensive (Hey, they gotta make a buck)  PLUSES: - $3.00 movies, a bargain in this, and any other, economy - Awesome lobby and inner sanctum hall! - Time travel for cheaps.  While the Silver Cinemas will never be my prime theater, it will be where I go to catch a movie I may have missed on it's first run.  AND, a really cool place to feel nostalgic for the late 70's and early 80's. If you like such things, make sure that you check this theater out!

Okay, so I liked Mamma Mia's.  Went with a co-worker for an escape from the workplace doldrums.  For cheap pizza, it's pretty damn great.  But for great pizza, it's... alright.  My 4 stars come through my "cheap bastard" filter; I rate my food not only by taste, but by value. Value = great here, so it pulled my 3 stars to 4. I've not often spent so little for pizza that tasted this good.  It wasn't a very comfortable place to eat in, but that's not really the point of Mamma Mia's. I know that, now. It's a take-out joint. Or, if it's not frikkin' hot, eat outside.  You'd probably want to call in your order, and take it back somewhere air conditioned to eat.  Pizza = garlic + cheese Crust = a little too done, but nice and thin. Size = BIG pieces. Man-boy likes this.  Verdict = If you're wanting to battle your belly viking on the cheap, this is a great place to grab a slice.

Okay. I'm angry.  -1 Star (For being cross)  Food is simply not supposed to be this savory, this delicious, this damn fine.  - 1 Star (Cornish Pasty is too good)  Meat/gravy/vegis that comes wrapped in a golden crust is simply not legal. I had something called the "Cottage Pasty".  -1 Star (Golden crust legality issue)  I noticed that on the menu, there was no chance that they'd make Pasty boxing gloves for me to wear, and punch my own face with this delectable treat. This is a problem for me, as I'd like to have their food around my face in greater quantities.  - 1 Star (No Pasty boxing gloves on menu.)  I feel that dark wizards got together to create this unnatural feast. It must be unholy food, as these pasties should not be this desirable and fabulous.  - 1 Star (Dark magics and too tasty ingredients)  However, if this establishment were to ever disappear from my locality, I would throw myself off of the tallest castle that I could find, while yelling "for the PASTY!!!!!".  +5 Stars (Please never stop.)

Red Hot Robot is a fantastic little "urban culture" art store. I don't know what else to call it.  Sure, it's full of cool vinyl toys, but also prints, books, cards, local art... things the the owner has carefully selected and arranged with a keen eye.  Even my wife has been swayed by the Robot, who usually doesn't like to follow me into stores like this. She's gotten interested in the vinyl toy movement, too!  I've always had great service, and parking has never been an issue for me.  My favorite store in PHX.

Crappy bar food. Greasy.  Didn't know we were going to a strip club, though the service was friendly.  Won't be back.

So, we live in the middle of sprawl, in the far NW 'burbs.  The only real restaurants around us are the typical chain places... you know... the Chilis, the TGiFridays, that sort of thing. Fine if that's what you're into, but... we like things a little more interesting and unique than that.  So, with a great deal of surprise, a new restaurant by the name of "Kawaii" opens up next to our local Walmart grocery store. What? I figured that at best, we'd get some stupid chain fast food dealio.  So, last night, we decided to try Kawaii. Wowsa, the place was packed, and we managed to get a little booth in the corner.  Atmosphere: Good. A hybrid of Japanese tradition (wooden booth benches) and modern decor.  Staff: Nice folks, that seemed to be sincerely there to serve.  Food: Tasty!  My wife and I both ordered Bento boxes. Her: the tofu. Me, the shrimp. Both teriyaki. Our son ordered the Soba noodles, vegi style.   Salad - crisp and cold, with a nice ginger-mustardy dressing. Tasty and fresh.  Miso - Creamy flavor. Again goodly.  Tofu Bento - The tofu was cooked fabulously; crisp and chewy on the outside, buttery on the inside and served on stir-fried teriyaki vegis. The vegis were cooked right and good. 6 little Shumai were nice little bites. The California rolls of course were clearly far better than the ones served next door. Chewy rice and clearly fresh.  Shrimp Bento - Pretty much the same as above. The dish came with maybe a dozen medium shrimp... all good and peppery, with a nice brown teriyaki sauce.   Soba - Man this was great as well. Lots of vegetables, and soba that tasted like they may be making it there. It was really good, and while I dug my Bento, I think that I would have enjoyed the Soba just as much. Really tasty, my 6 year old son just kept eating it.  So, all really, really  great.  Downsides:  No kid's menu, no specific kid's offering. It was a little painful to order a $13 meal for our kid. But hey, I'm cheap.  Prices were pretty standard for this kind of food. It's not cheap food, but they're not gouging you for it either. I felt like I had a great meal, not a stab in the back.  When we go again, I'll let you know how it fared.
