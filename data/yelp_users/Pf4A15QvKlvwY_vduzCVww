I have found my mechanic. I had used this shop a few times for oil changes from a discount Super Saver card. They always finished quick and did a good job, refilling all fluids and letting me know what might need to be repaired. They also did not charge me extra, as most shops do, as my 2002 Cadillac Deville takes appx. 8 quarts of oil. Again, they told me what MIGHT need to be repaired. There was no "the sky is falling scenario", pressuring me into getting unnecessary repairs at that moment. But I was let know it should get fixed eventually.       This honesty brought me back to the shop when I had a little extra cash to put into my ride, and I was very pleased with the results. I needed my fuel pump replaced which caused some fuel injection, and loss of power issues. Also, I had several leaks of my radiator, which suggested I needed all hoses connected to my radiator replaced. This was all done on one Saturday at a very reasonable rate. Many mechanics do try to fleece you because Cadillacs are supposed to be harder to fix. I did not feel this way at all. The work was done properly and I felt Craig, the shop manager, was straight up and explained everything completely and honestly.       OEM parts were used in the repair and I was not gouged a higher price. They also saved all the old parts taken out to show the customer the wear on them. He even replaced my thermostat for free! And my gas gauge, which has never worked in the 2+ years I have owned the car was now operational, also at no extra charge!  Overall a very positive experience. I am comfortable that Imperial Auto and Craig will be my mechanics for years to come.

Very disappointing. Ambiance is a lot nicer, and restaurant is much cleaner than location on Van Buren. The last couple of times I dined at the Van Buren location were a tad weird. One time, a couple of friends and I were BSing in the parking lot, when a creepy guy in a half shirt approached and inquired to when the gay club next door opened. The last time, a dude that seemed like he was on something, was loudly tossing around profanities and asking for change-inside the restaurant.       Unfortunately the quality of the food at this Priest location is not even close. Decided to check out this location with my girlfriend after we purchased a Deal Chicken half-price voucher.  Cashier stated he could not accept my Deal Chicken discount after order was placed. Eventually rectified after much confusion. Food was ready at pick up counter very swiftly after transaction was completed. And that is where the positivity of the visit ended.       We had a couple of combo meals to try a variety and everything was a disappointment. First tasted were the baby back ribs. They were not bad-tender and cooked decent. But the taste was bland. It's like they use a whole different cooking process then the Van Buren restaurant. None of the woodsy smokiness that weaves into the meat and outward to your taste buds. In fact, none of the meats possessed this quality. We also had chicken and pork sandwiches which were perfectly fine, but not up to the Honey Bear's standard, that has made them a Valley favorite for decades.       The side dishes were not an opinion changer either. We had macaroni and cheese that had a mushy consistency not unlike chunky mashed potatoes. Decent cheese flavor if it hadn't been doused in what seemed like half a shaker's worth of pepper. Similarly, the beans, which have always been some of my favorite legumes, were overwhelmed with the cook's over-anxious shaker arm. It even affected the BBQ sauce, which has always been a sublime combo of sweet and smoky with tender ham chunks. But with way too much spice, all the usual standout flavors are dismissed.        Lastly, for dessert a peach cobbler would end the subpar experience. Still piping hot when I popped the lid on the container 20 minutes after it was packed, I had hope. Again a letdown was in store. The cobbler at the bottom was disgustingly uncooked like a huge chunk of cookie dough with no sugar or tastiness. As a certified sweet aficionado, I do not dismiss any sugar products quickly. With this though, it was one bite and into the trash it went. Ok, more like two bites-just to be sure. A sorry end to a meal I approached with great anticipation. As one of my favorite BBQ brands, I will not give up on Honey Bears. It just may be awhile till I visit again. And it will be to the Van Buren location. And I will sit back, savor the taste, and enjoy the cast of characters there.

Real good basic Mexican food. Been to this location twice and the flagship in El Paso once. Always go with the same thing with satisfying results......the carne asada platter. The carne comes on a hot plate sizzling with temptation. Also has beans, rice and tortillas.  First off, my girlfriend and I told the cashier to hold the guacamole-we're both mildly allergic (a travesty, I know) and he offered to double our tortillas from five to ten. Hell yeah, we're off to a great start!        Next we were off to the salsa bar to load up on the extras-and there are plenty of em. About ten different varieties, along with marinated onions, jalapenos, guacamole, limes, cilantro, etc. Many great choices, along with a helpful explanation of each salsa, its heat level, and what meat it pairs best with. And before we could finish loading up our cornucopia of condiments the order was sizzling at the pickup counter.      After about two more minutes of salsa selection, we're headed back to the table to a still crackling platter surrounded by two individual servings each of beans and rice. The carne asada was a perfect mix of crispy edges paired with tender chunks, atop a layer of marinated onions. The beans were whole, brown, and included the best mix-in of all-bacon! The rice was soft and fluffy, with a perfect smoky seasoning. Tortillas were good quality (we opted for flour), thin and flexible, but with the heft to hold all our stuffings in. All these ingredients made for a great make-your-own taco to be specified to one's own liking.       No real complaints about the food except for the serve yourself tortilla chips that were mostly broken and coldish.  Not much atmosphere, but the food is the star here. A game room with about ten video games is tucked away in the southeastern portion of the building to provide some entertainment for the kids if time is needed to settle that stomach. lol. Overall, a great value as the platter ($19.07 after tax) can feed two-three, and there are larger choices. We strive to come back and explore the rest of the menu, but memories of the sizzle have made it hard so far.

Very fun and they manage to make me laugh without vulgarity. Which is pretty hard to do sometimes. Lol.

Great staff and treatment.  Very helpful and friendly.  I arrived at 9:50 on a saturday night when they closed at 10:00 and was in the back within 5 minutes. I'm guessing since it was a Saturday night everyone would want to get off work and go home....or party!! But, they never made me feel that way, as they were courteous and patient, yet prompt and thorough . My insurance had lapsed and I received three stitches, along with the painkilling shot, and an X-ray all for only $250, when a couple others I called ranged from $400-800  Nurse was very kind and gave me plenty of care material to take home. I hope I do not need a reason to go back, but if I do would not hesitate to revisit.
