Do not go here! I paid $40 to have my truck washed and they proceeded to remove the parking pass for my employment from my dash. The parking pass was stuck to the dash with adhesive!!! The pass cost me $75 to replace and when I called to inform the manager the best he could do for me was offer me "free services". I'm now out over $100 for what should have been a very simple car wash. Choose anywhere else!

My husband and I are Gilbert locals and frequent the Heritage District often. We have been looking forward to the opening of this new restaurant for weeks. We went in Friday night and thought immediately it might not have been the best idea with the hour long wait. We decided to stick it out and went to the bar to sit down for a drink while we waited for our table. The bar was very full and we were fortunate to find two seats outside. This might have been or best decision of the night. The misting system was beautiful and dropped the temperature down by at least 20degrees.   We sat outside and everyone around us seemed to be really enjoying themselves. The bartenders name was Tyler and he was very enthusiastic and talkative with all the customers even while being very busy. Throughout the night he would engage and educate all of the customers outside about drinks and the food at once just for fun. He recommended a cocktail that had tomatoes in it. I was hesitant but it ended up being one of the best cocktails I have ever had. We were going to wait for a table but we were so impressed and entertained by the bartender that we decided to stay outside and enjoy the show with our meal.  My husband ordered the Don Alfonso pizza and I had the Pomo. Both were fantastic and definitely good enough reasons to come back. However, anytime that I return in the future, I will make sure to look for our new favorite bartender in the Heritage District before getting a table. This place is a must see!

Stopped into Pedal Haus for the first time this Thursday night. My husband and I were going to a movie and were surprised by the size of the place. The restaurant is beautiful! We sat at the bar and the two male bartenders were very awesome. They greeted us and taught us all about their beer. We were allowed to sample, which is always nice. I drank the Maple Milk Stout and my husband had the Weizen. Both were fantastic! We were sad we had to leave for the movie between the amazing service and the even better beer we will definitely be back!
