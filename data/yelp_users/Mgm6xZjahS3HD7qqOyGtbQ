Great salon.  I got a cut and color by Ashley Wright and she did a phenomenal job.  I have been going back to her ever since and trust her every time she does my hair.  She listens to what I want and does it; simple as that.  She never chops inches off when I just want a trim and always gets the color just right for the season!

Great place for lunch!  Their menu is huge, there is so much to choose from. Sandwiches, pasta salads, salads, etc. Their grilled cheese is amazing.  Only criticism is that they need more seating!

AMAZING food and I'm a vegetarian!  Their pizza, appetizers, and sandwiches are great.  Good brews too!  My only complaint is that it is REALLY loud and pretty pricey.    I tried to go there for a late lunch (around 2 or 3pm) with a friend one day and they wouldn't let her in since she wasn't 21.  I thought that turning away business at that time of day was kind of strange.

Great wraps and sandwiches. Some very good vegetarian options too. My favorites are the Veggie Supreme and the Greek Wrap. Check to ASU Student handbooks for coupons!  Be aware that they don't stay open too late though.

This is the only tanning salon within walking distance from ASU.  I wish they had longer hours (they close at 9pm most nights) so that I could always make it there after work.  I have tried all level beds here and been satisfied with them all.  I was shocked at myself for paying what I did for a one time upgrade to a level 5 bed two weeks ago but I got great color that lasted.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and they proved clean towels and goggles.  Look for coupons that they put in The Student Handbook that are handed out on ASU's campus every year.

I've been here multiple times, once for a pedicure and other times to get acrylics and have never been impressed.  This is the only nail salon withing walking distance of ASU's Tempe campus so they know they will gte business no matter their prices or customer service.  I always feel rushed and the staff is typically rude.  They are constantly trying to charge me more money for a simple design with my pedicure or tell me I need a totally new full set when I go in for a fill.  They nail technicians have been really rough and it hurts!  I shouldn't dread getting pampered.  During my last experience I asked the nail tech to make my nails a bit shorter and she got so huffy about it and rough with my hands that I almost had to ask her to stop (and I typically deal well with pain)!  Unless you're an ASU student without the motivation to find transportation elsewhere I would not recommend this salon.

From the looks of this place, both inside and out, you would think that they would have better deals.  The appearance is what I would call "ghetto".    The beds must be old because I thought it was going to close all the way down on my face when I got in for the first time.  They also allow you to tan 20min in  the same level bed that other salons only allow 15min in and I felt as if I did not get as good as color so the bulbs must be old too.  The beds are cracked and look ancient.  Cheap paper posters are falling off the wall, they have tacky cork boards for local advertising and even tack fliers up in the room.  I'm not interested in auto-glass, etc. when I'm tanning, sorry.  Music is played out of an old-school "boom box", and they still have pictures on "employees" on their 'employee wall' of girls who haven't worked there in years.  I don't even want to know how long their lotions have been sitting around.  One day I accidentally left my Michael Kors rose gold watch in a room, called to inquire about it and they claimed they didn't have it.  Obviously they clean the rooms after each client so I'm guessing that one of the employees is rocking my watch these days.  I have another friend that left her lotion for them to hold there (a service they offer) and the next time she went to tan they claimed they had throw it away.  I'm guessing a nice bottle of lotion didn't just go in the trash and maybe an employee got to put that to use too.  Look around for cards locally that offer 1 week free or $10 for 10 days to new customers to try this place out if you still feel inclined to go.

The best nail salon I have ever been to!  There was no wait and all of the staff were very friendly  They were easy to understand which can honestly be difficult at times when you visit a nail salon.  The nail technician did my nails just how I wanted them and didn't try to charge me, "5 dollar extra" for everything.  She listened to what I wanted and did it for me.  My nails were drying a little bit after 7pm (their closing time on weekdays) and they didn't rush me out.  My only complaint is that the salon looked a bit outdated and could use some visual updates and a UV light to dry my nails under so they I didn't have to sit in front of a little fan the whole time.

I was EXTREMELY disappointed by this place. I went out to dinner here with a friend before a night out in the club upstairs and received awful service from the start. The hostess suggested we sit at the sushi bar to avoid a wait for a table and then failed to walk us to the back to seat us. We awkwardly wandered through the restaurant until we reached the sushi bar in the back and there we not even any open seat there. Once we were finally seated our waiter brought us water and took our order. We said we wanted to hold off on ordering drinks until we got our food.  A different waiter than or original one brought out our food and we were never checked on. Didn't have the chance to order drinks, no one asked how our food was or if we needed anything...we were totally ignored. I ended up asking a third staff member in passing to bring me a drink. A man who appeared to have a managerial position based on the way he was dressed was wandering around our area for awhile and never even picked up on the fact that we were not being helped. About an hour later we had to ask him where our server was just to get our bill and neither apologized to us.  I had high expectations for this place based on the prices and reputation but was extremely disappointed and will not be back next time I'm in town.

I had a minor injury that I needed to be seen for.  I had heard of the WAHOO service that they provide so I went online, submitted a short questionnaire and within minutes their 800 # had called me back to set up a time to come in.  They had a room ready for me when I got there and once I went through triage the doctor was in to see me within minutes.   They administered a tetanus shot for no additional cost, cleaned up my wound, and taught me how to take care of it on my own.  I was there less than an hour and received superior treatment.

My favorite boutique on Mill Ave.  The prices are very reasonable wtih a huge sale section.  I can always find something that I love and can't live without.  The store is clean and easy to navigate.  Very friendly and helpful staff as well!

I love everything about this place!  Amazing employees, product, and service.  The management must be doing something right because they always have what I want, the employees are all extremely friendly and competent (something that seems rare these days), and the service is fast.  I've had great iced coffee, hot chocolate, flavored Red Bull, and smoothies here.  The drive thru is so convenient, especially on the way to class.  They offer punch cards (buy 10 drinks, get 1 free) and distribute coupons around ASU's campus.  The prices are great; some of their drinks are  almost half the price they would be at Starbucks!

My favorite sports bar ever!  They have good deals and specials every night of the week.  Tacos on Tuesdays, pizzas on Wednesdays. 2-4-1 drinks on Thursdays 8pm-1am (my favorite), etc.  Happy hour 4-7 with 1/2 off all apps and drinks.  Huge bar area to get serves fast, nice patio, flat screens everywhere, shuffle board, and pool.  My only complaint is that they need larger bathrooms with more stalls; the lines get ridiculous on busy nights.

So far I've only used their tanning services and and happy with everything but the wait time. They could use some more beds in there.  I'm wondering if anyone has used their teeth whitening services and what you thought. Was it worth the money?

Delicious! Great sandwiches and you can buy their "day old bread" to make you own sandwich at home.   The really do have "freaky fast service" both in-store and delivery. The staff is always very friendly too and they have really reasonable prices on their sandwiches.   Add hot peppers to any sub for an extra kick!

I have been tanning here on a very consistent basis for 2 years now.  The staff is very friendly and always looking to help you out.  Because I am a regular I have gotten two bottles of lotion 30% off and it is things like that that keep me coming back.  I tan in the level one beds and it is less than $20/month for unlimited tanning, great deal!  It is always clean and I love that they are open late (until 11pm most days) so it fits into my busy schedule.  My only complaint is that you get charged automatically every month as a member.  I would prefer if you had to come in to pay every month.    If you are an ASU student look for their coupons in The Student Handbook every year and don''t forget to refer a friend to get $5 added on to your account for upgrades!

Great clothes, great accessories and Steve Madden shoes. Doesn't get much better than this. There is a range of prices ($30-$108 for a dress, etc). Friendly staff and a clean place. I love shopping here.  Check the ASU Student Insider coupon book for coupons!

They get the job done and no complaints here. There is one nail tech that is very easy to understand and I like going to her.   I have only gotten acrylics put on here two or three times and have been satisfied each time.  If you are an ASU student look for their coupons in The Student Handbook each year.

Fun bar to hit for a night out as well as a good place to watch college football on the weekends. Appetizer specials, free shots when ASU scores, a big screen to watch the game on and a good rowdy crowd of fans.  Food was decent besides the mozzarella sticks...those were weird...pass 'em up.

Delicious! This place was so good and had many decently health options. I went for lunch to celebrate a co-workers birthday and will definitely be back. Interested to see what their dinner menu is like.  I also love the looks of this place, super cute and a really nice patio too.

I loved this! It was so much fun and something different to do. I drove all the way from Tempe and it was definitely worth the trip. Great staff and amazing studio. We had a ton of fun and I love how I didn't have to worry about buying supplies, setting up or much of a clean up. The regular price is $40 per 2 hour session but I purchased a Living Social deal for $20. If they do any deals in the future I will definitely go again but $40 is a bit steep.

One of my favorite places to go for lunch! The food is great (greek salad, hummus, tzatziki, veggie pita pizza, spinach feta roll ups), the staff is friendly and the wait time on the food is never bad. Decently priced for what you get. Get a reusable Zoes cup for soft drinks, etc. if you plan to go here often!

Love this place! My manager set up an employee meeting for our store here and we all loved it! Great food, plenty of sitting room, good lighting and friendly staff. I will definitely be back!   Their menu kind of reminds me of Pita Jungle's menu - hummus, tzatziki, baba ganoush, wraps, pasta, pizzas and much more. There were lots of vegetarian options (which I appreciate) and daily specials. We all shared an starter sampler with roasted red pepper hummus, tzatziki, baba ganoush, pita and veggies and I ordered the black bean and corn tamales. All good stuff.  Everyone should check out this little gem!

Not a fan. I went for lunch with a group and we were literally the only people there. There were 12 of us and our food took a long time to come out. I got the mac n' cheese and wasn't very impressed compared to what I paid for it. Nothing special and kind of over priced.  The staff was very friendly though, I'll give them that. I would go one more time at night to check out the bar scene there and give this place a second chance.
