Dr. Frost and the entire team at Red Mountain Root Canals are amazing. I have had several root canals over the last 10 years, all performed by Dr. Frost. Pain free, efficient and incredibly nice people. They even saved me from a tooth needing a root canal by determining it wasn't the tooth, but a sinus infection. I have referred countless friends and even my parents to Red Mountain Root Canals.   You don't go to a foot doctor for open heart surgery, why would you go to a regular dentist for this highly specialized procedure? Next time your dentist says you need a root canal, tell them you have an endodontist for that and call Red Mountain, you won't regret it!

Holy crap does this place not have ANY customer service in their DNA.  As the retail customer and the person that ultimately keeps them in business, you'd think they'd be a little warmer, more helpful and willing to work with you. They are not. In fact my wife and I found them snobby, condescending and not at all helpful.  During the remodel process, we had to go to the slab yard a few times, each time felt like we were an inconvenience to them.   The final trip to Arizona Tile came a week before fabrication. Our fabricator Diamond Granite (see their AWESOME review on Yelp, went to confirm our slab was there. He asked them to pull it for us so that we could see it at 1:30PM as we had a very limited window of time to view the slab before picking up kids at school. When we arrived, they were once again too busy for us and had us take a seat. When we got to talk to someone they were unaware of our slab and asked who had our paperwork? How are we supposed to know? We were told they never pull a slab until a customer arrives and we'd have to wait for a large truckload that was now being offloaded.   We told them we had to be out at 2PM. It was now 1:45. At 2PM, we were told to be patient. At 2:15PM someone went out to see if the slab was there. It wasn't until 2:20PM a full 50 minutes after we arrived, that we had minutes to confirm our slab choice.  I couldn't wait to get out of there. My wife and I hated the experience of working with Arizona Tile. The other company we looked at was Bedrosian's and the experience there was night and day different.  Our recommendation: Go to Bedrosian's first for great customer service. If they don't have what you want, be prepared to get crappy customer service in exchange for the larger selection.

You want New York pizza? Go to New York. You want the best New York pizza in Arizona? Go to Venezia's. Yes this family run shop was featured in Breaking Bad, and they have shops in AZ and NM. This pizza is better than any other pizza place that claims to have New York pizza. Trust me, I'm a New Yorker.

As always the food and service at Chelsea's Kitchen were exceptional. They are masterful at combining flavor, atmosphere and service to make every meal I've had there a memorable one.   My only complaint isn't necessarily with the restaurant as much as it is this new trend to make Kale the hip vegetable that everyone should eat. People it's used in floral arrangements and is a plate garnish at best. Kale is the most gas producing, fart creating vegetable in the world. Why on gods green earth would anyone want to eat this crap? Please stop putting it on our plates. Yes, you too Chelsea's Kitchen.

Sylvia and the entire staff are truly awesome. We feel like family when we eat here, the portions are generous, the food is amazing. Having spent part of my teenage years in the Mediterranean, I can say with certainty the food is authentic.

I have to start with huge props to Toyota for always taking care of their customers. The customer service we get at Riverview and Toyota as a brand have been nothing short of exceptional over the years, this time even more so.  We brought our 2005 Toyota Sienna in for a sliding door issue, it was rubbing the metal of the minivan body and not sliding well. It had an alignment issue. Our service advisor Rich Filippin quotes me $485 for the parts and labor, informing me the door had to come off to repair this issue.  Later in the day I got the call from Rich. He had good news and bad new for me. The bad news was, the car needed to stay overnight. The worse news was that when they removed the door, they discovered the pulling cable had frayed and the wire was bound around the doors motor. This caused much of the grinding we felt and heard when the electronically door opened or closed. The part was $1,500. Here we are with an out of warranty repair at 80,000 miles and Rich informed me that Toyota will cover the replacement of the motor and cable. Why? Because they felt it shouldn't have degraded and failed the way it did. We still had to pay for the hinge, and I can't complain about that. The two issues were on the same door, but clearly unrelated.  Once again, year in, year out, this is one of the many reasons I own Toyota vehicles. It's why I will buy another one, and one after that. They understand what customer service is, and they deliver a consistently great product every time.   Final note, I purchased my first Hybrid from Riverview in April 2008, just before they moved to their great location off the 202. I have now had 1 purchase and 6 service experiences at Riverview Toyota and can say without hesitation, they are fantastic to deal with from sales to service. I highly recommend them.

Let's start with an easy tip. If you are a first timer here and are new to Thai food I strongly recommend you start with pad Thai. This is a safe bet as it won't kill you, and leave you with a "Thai food is too spicy for me" feeling. Look, the reality is Thai food is freaking hot.  Thai Rama is my favorite spot for Thai. Introduced by a friend several years ago, Thai Rama is a go to place for me when I'm in Tempe.   The service is always good, the food is outstanding. As with all Thai food the combination of flavors awakens the soul, or at least your sweat glands. I never order above medium heat and often times find myself in a full on sweat. My friend orders extra hot and never breaks a sweat. I guess we are all wired differently.  If you follow my advice and start off by ordering pad Thai, here is my next recommendation. On subsequent trips I would recommend that you go through the menu and try different items one by one. You will soon find many favorites on their extensive menu.  Finally, if you do by chance eat something super spicy and want to put the fire out, grab a beer.

Seldom do I crap on a place in my reviews. But when your customer service sucks, too bad.   Ok, so I am waiting for my MRI and decided to live post my review.   I had an 8:30 pm MRI appt. on a Friday night. No one is here. They called the 1 person in the waiting room back at 8:40. I am live posting this review at 9:30 pm, an hour after my appointment time, still waiting. They told me I'd be here until 9:30. They have zero customer service. No one has said, "sorry we are running so far behind", not a hint of caring. I hope the image they produce is better than the image they present. Go somewhere else, they need a customer service makeover. Badly!!!   (Updated 9:37pm. Still waiting)  (Updated 9:45pm. Told they are running behind) really?  (Updated 10:00pm. Still waiting.  At least give me the option to decide if I want to wait or reschedule my appointment. Don't make me wait 90 minutes beyond my appointment time.   Next update coming soon.  And at 10:10pm I was finally taken in.

I'm giving them 2 stars, why? Well, I subtract one star for each tip jar on the counter. While I really like Cold Stone, there ice cream is always top notch, I am so done with tip jars all over the place. Do we really need 3 jars? How about just continue to do a good job and be rewarded by collecting a paycheck? One tip jar okay, but that's it.

Great $5 pizzas, but the subs are killer! You need to try every one of them and find your favorites. The buffalo chicken sub was picked by a friend. I took a bite and was hooked. Their Giant Pizzas are great for big families or party's. They feed lots of people and the leftovers can be frozen and reheated like they just came out of the oven. Delivery drivers are prompt, the food is always hot and now that they have online ordering, it's easy to order what we want, when we want it.

Wow, were we disappointed multiple times with one visit. We hired Wave to do a post kitchen renovation deep clean. They were to do shutters, window sills, etc. They did a good job on the regular cleaning, but get an F for the deep clean. They breezed in an out of the house in 2 hours and brushed over the stuff we paid them to do. When we called the office, they offered us a partial refund (still waiting for that) and they were going to have someone come out to re-do what was missed.  The person showed up Friday to see what needed to be done and was to come back Saturday. When Saturday morning rolled around we contacted them to let them know we had a contractor in the house just in case it wasn't convenient. The person said it wasn't a good day anyway due to a family emergency. We get that, things happen.  We waited until Wednesday for them to rescheduled and when no one did, we called. My wife had to start over again, explaining everything that was missed. She was then told we would incur a $25 cancellation charge for Saturday. REALLY? We did not cancel on them.   If you need a cleaning service we don't recommend Wave. They don't keep their promises and they are unreliable.

We decided to use Inspired LED for the under and over cabinet lighting in our kitchen renovation project. First we were overwhelmed trying to figure out which lights, what connectors and how to make it all happen. We decided to use their online live chat feature and were able to have a back-and-forth discussion with one of their employees. Not only was that employee helpful, they told us about the free design service they offer. We simply emailed our kitchen design plans and cabinet layout to them told them what we were looking for as far as lighting and they did the rest.  They emailed us back a complete set of plans that included every type of light fixture, wire connector, switch and component necessary to light our kitchen. The package arrived in one day and had another set of instructions just in case we lost the plans they had emailed us. Within 30 minutes I had installed every light, made every connection and had our kitchen cabinets lit up beautifully. The only criticism I have is that their website doesn't completely explain the components and connectors you need with every option or configuration. You really need to interface with a human being to understand all of that. Finally, while I really like the under-cabinet dimmer switch, it feels a little cheap and doesn't function the way typical dimmer switch functions. It's a tiny dot of a button you have to push 1-4 times to get the desired power. It's a weird switch and should be designed better.

My first review was 4 stars NOW 1. The owner had my review removed citing I violated content guidelines. I find that a gutless move to address a concern I had as a customer. Let me see if Yelp removes this one.  I recognize that they are getting five-star reviews for a product that is fantastic. They will NOT get that from me because of two experiences I've had in their shop.   Yes they have really good gelato, dare I say amazing? But the owner (not an employee) needs better customer service skills. The owner yelled at one of my kids for touching the glass when pointing at the flavor they wanted. She had just had an employee clean the display. Sorry, ma'am it's an ice cream shop and your displays are at knee level for adults, eye level for kids. Get over it.   I removed the other part of my review which directly spoke about an employee.   What floors me is rather than the owner using Yelp to talk to me as a customer, they defensively had my review removed. If this one disappears, I will assume it's because FROST is a paid Yelp advertiser and they will bend over backwards for businesses that give them money.

On a scale of 1 to 10, I don't know if WOW is acceptable? Elite spent hours detailing the exterior of our camper. After washing it and removing the oxidation they brought it back to a factory shine. I cannot wait to have them back to work on our cars.

What a great customer experience. Unlike our experience at Arizona Tile (read my review on Yelp) Bedrosians made us feel welcome and even allowed our children the cook experience of going into the slab lot.  They grabbed the slabs we were looking for without hesitation and even moved them into an area that had direct sunlight so we could see fine detail.  The customer service was stellar. Their selection while good, wasn't nearly as wide as Arizona Tile, but that doesn't matter to me.  If you are doing a remodel, shop for your slabs at Bedrosians for great service. If they don't have what you need, you might be stuck shopping at Arizona Tile. I pity you if you have to go there.

Good food. Lethargic service.  I waited to review The Egg I Am until after my 3rd visit. My first visit, I thought the slow service was a fluke. Visit 2, the server had a new server in training as a shadow, so again I gave them a pass. My 3rd visit made me realize that the slow service is an ongoing issue.  While the food is good, you best not be in a hurry. If you go bring your patients.

What a difference a few months makes. Had a great breakfast meeting and the service was OUTSTANDING! Tentative, efficient, no waiting. The food was superb and the service matched the quality. I love a restaurant that responds to a complaint by making adjustments. Can't wait to go again.

The lobster bisque was out of this world. For an east coast native, this is the best seafood restaurant I've found in Arizona. The bar manager John makes a mean Old Fashioned too. My wife had the Tide Roast which was an 8 out of 10, I had the gumbo which was 9 out of 10. Go, eat and enjoy.

I wish we installed a home theatre sooner. Justin and the team at Wright AV are pros. They were affordable, have great customer service and did an incredible job. Our basement was transformed from a TV room to a home theatre in a day, and has become one of our favorite spaces to hang out as a family.  We cannot wait to spend the holidays with everyone in our new home theatre room.  If you are looking for a pro installer and one with integrity, Justin and Wright AV are top notch. Popcorn not included. :)
