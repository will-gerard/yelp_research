My favorite Modified memories:  -Piebald.  Super fun! -The last Suicide Nation show with Jeromes Dream, Usurp Synapse, and Racebannon.  Seriously some of the most intense sets ever. -Love Life and Get Hustle. -Getting drunk outside while my friend thought he gave a homeless person his car keys in a handful of coins from his pocket.  After breaking his passenger window with a brick, he found them in THE GLOVE BOX.  Who puts their keys in the glove box?! -More recently, any time I walk through it now during First Friday to see some (usually) wonderful artwork.  I hope Modified never goes anywhere.  I've got some iffy memories too that are mostly tied to how sketchy the surrounding neighborhood used to be, but it is incredible to see how much it has come along.

Oh, the bread.  I had read enough glowing Yelp reviews.  Today, nothing else would suffice for lunch than a sandwich from Pane Bianco.  Truth be told, the overwhelming praise was the perfect set up.  You know - big expectation, big disappointment.  I've driven by the joint a few times, but actually missed it while blowing down Central.  The light rail tracks made for a tricky time getting back, but I managed.  I walked in the front door.  Small line.  Small customer area.  Seriously, there's enough open space in the back to move the counter 30 feet and insert some tables.  Whatever, I still dug the look.  Small menu.  I ordered the house mozzarella with a house cola, waited for my food, and set up shop on a picnic table outside with my wife.  The sandwich was great but the bread was FANTASTIC with a capital F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C.  Seriously.  I'm still thinking about it.  So, in short, Pane Bianco lived up to every unrealistic expectation I had based on this silly and irreplaceable website.  Businesses like this are the reason Phoenix has gotten 500x cooler in the past few years.

I'm a huge movie buff.  Huuuuge.  4 or 5 years ago, I walked into Movies on Central looking for something or other.  I didn't find it, but liked the place all the same.  Good selection.  Actually, probably a better selection than anywhere else in town.  But seeing as I lived in Ahwatukee at the time, I didn't have much cause to make the trek.  Besides, Netflix had everything I needed.  Now that I live much closer and MoC (that abbreviation is probably annoying, but I'm tired) is more or less on my way home from work, I can stop in easily.  So I did last night, in search of a film called Dementia 13.  I called ahead to verify they had it and hopped in my car.  Central Ave is still a big pain in the ass thanks to light rail construction, but I got there with little trouble.  I don't have much more to say other than the selection is still great, the guy who helped me sign up was really friendly, and I'll probably be back.  I still have Netflix, but I look forward to MoC satisfying my appetite for instant gratification.

The last time we ate at Houston's, we waited 90 minutes for a table. They had quoted 45. We complained. They told us "just five to ten more minutes"  a few times. I was super hungry and expected something to be comped. Anything. I guess they didn't feel the same.  And let's not kid ourselves - the food is just okay. I'm convinced people eat at Houston's because it's at the Biltmore, everyone wears their church clothes, and the decor is pretty nice. Dining here makes you feel like you have money, even though it's not very expensive. Or maybe that's just me.

A typical outing to the Veggie House with my girlfriend  looks like this:  -Start with hot tea and vegetable soup -A small order of absolutely delicious spring rolls -Two entrees...usually the House Special Chicken and Broccoli Chicken  Have you ever gone to a restaurant repeatedly and ordered the same thing every time?  Seriously, if I had the eat and drink the above for the rest of my life, I'd totally be cool with it.  This place is golden in my book.  One time, my friend ordered the House Special Dinosaur.  When the waiter gave a confused and funny look, my friend explained that since it isn't really meat anyway, it shouldn't matter what you call it.  Try it sometime.

Five stars.  The staff at the Royal Palms is so unbelievably helpful and courteous.  I'm not sure I'm the type you might expect to find at a resort like this, but I've never detected a whiff of attitude from anyone here.  Last year, I reserved a "Royal Romance Package" which included dinner and a room, complete with champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries.  Our room was a large casita at the corner of the property, resulting in a very quiet and private experience.  Walking around the resort, you feel like you're really (as lame as it sounds typing this) in an "oasis in the desert."  The other guests have those silly, serene looks stuck to their faces.  The staff is always smiling.  Everything just seems so...leisurely.  Don't even get me started on T. Cook's.  The service and food are impeccable.  At first, the portions may seem a little smaller than you're used to, but the flavors more than make up for this.  I've eaten here a few times and the wait staff are always pleasant and conversational without intruding on our meal.  My fiance and I are currently planning our wedding here in the small, private Alegria garden.  The Royal Palms was the first and last place we toured; we just absolutely love this resort.

A little pricey for my liking, but good nonetheless.  I really like the feel of the restaurant: part Cuban, part Puerto Rican, part Spanish, all classy.  A guitar player jammed away in a completely non-annoying way while we ate our meal and, to me, that is an accomplishment.  Our Calypso Chips were outstanding.  To die for.  One of the best appetizers I can think of at the moment.  For my entree, I ordered the Ropa Vieja which was made up of the most perfectly tender beef and tasty rice with beans.  A little heavy with the peppers, however.  Does anybody else think plantains smell like feet?  My date pointed this out and, although I was surprised, I'm inclined to agree.  That won't stop me from putting some into my stomach as soon as humanly possible.

Breakfast foods are the best foods and, I'm pleased to report, Taylor's does the genre proud.  I've dined here twice, both in the morning.  Taylor's is located on the NE corner of 44th St and Camelback and, if you want to find it quickly, you should turn into the complex when you see Cork 'N Cleaver.  Otherwise, prepare to drive around in circles wondering if the map on Yelp was wrong.  It's a little hard to spot at first.  Inside, you'll find a cute little cafe with cute little tables and a cute little patio.  It's so cute I could just squeeze it.  Seriously though, it feels exactly like a breakfast joint should.  But let's get to the good stuff: the food.  I'm a big fan of morning grub and Taylor's certainly delivers.  My first visit, I had a chorizo and egg dish that was perfectly cooked and reasonably priced.  More recently, I had the poached eggs with salmon which was a giant mouthful of delicious.  If I remember correctly, all the poached egg dishes were priced the same regardless of meat choice, so I had to make it count.  I did knock off one star for the lackluster service we received on our most recent visit.  Still, if you're in the mood for some breakfast eats and the Good Egg sounds about as exciting as a Coldplay mixtape, give Taylor's a try.

The pizza is really good. Just make sure you're on your A game - like other people have said, there are so. many. rules. I've never caught attitude from an employee, but they've got me terrified.

I've spent the past year on the hunt for good chinese food near my house. Flamingo Palace, while about six miles away, is good enough and close enough.  The Hot and Sour Soup was more sour than hot - but not in a bad way. Pretty tasty. I also enjoyed the Tofu Vegetable Delight. The real standout, though, was the Flamingo Special Chicken. Loved it.  Our waitress was nice, if a little off. She thanked us sheepishly every time we said that our food did, in fact, taste good. Kind of funny the first time. Weirder and weirder every time after.  Time to reheat my leftovers.

As much as I hate to admit it, I'm about to be "that guy."  You know, the one who can catalog and recite exactly what he drank.  Rest assured, there is a purpose.  I've only been to Blooze once.  A couple friends and I wanted to play some pool near my house.  This is where we ended up.  I purchased a pitcher and approximately five bottles of beer over the course of two hours.  My tab was $12.50.  Twelve dollars and fifty cents.  Five stars.   Oh, minus one star for getting stared down by a few scary biker dudes.

Five stars for their new happy hour menu, which they call their "economic stimulus package."   4:00-6:00pm and 9:00pm-close: Domestic drafts are 75 cents. Pitchers? $2.99. Small pitchers are somewhere in between.   I'm really, really easy to please.

I'm a half-Anglo Mexican, raised on cheesy potatoes (thanks, Mom) and tamales (thanks, Nana). It amazes me that Middle-Eastern food came to be my favorite.  I dig Yusef's. The Gyros are delicious. The hummus is delicious. Everyone is nice. It's cheap. Maybe not Haji-Baba cheap, but if two can get a good lunch for under 15 bucks, that's cheap enough. I've never bought anything from the grocery, save for a chocolate-covered banana candy, but they seem to have a pretty good selection of everything you'd need to make some awesome grub.  I hope they're open today - I'm hungry.

How have I not reviewed sweet, sweet Carolina's?  This place is a dump in the best possible way.  If you've never been here, you're likely to grimace upon arrival.  Sure, the neighborhood is rough, but the real shocker is how dirty this place looks, inside and out.  Why 5 stars, then?  At Carolina's, it's all about the food.  The tortillas are, as already stated, to die for.  They're soft, yet strong.  Your burrito probably won't be exploding all over itself mid-meal.  I'm a huge fan of the Oaxaca Burrito, which contains generous helpings of chorizo, potato, and other delicious goodies.  The machaca is also very good.  Back to the dump factor (that sounded gross, sorry).  Normally I am easily creeped out by restaurant filth, but not here.  Carolina's reminds me of Christmas Eve parties at my Nana's.  Everyone sitting at shoddy tables in a little room, eating delicious food.  The only thing missing is the mariachi.

The portions are so big.  I can't even begin to tell you how much grub you'll end up getting if you go for one of those "dinner for two" options on the menu.  I think my date and I could only manage to finish half of the food.  Speaking of, the food itself is pretty good.  This isn't the best chinese meal you'll have, but it beats out nearly any take-out place you were thinking of ordering from.  The service is usually good, but can get pretty weird.  One time, I asked for a refill of my soda to which my waitress tersely replied, "no."  Not "we don't have free refills."  No choice to pay for another.  Just a simple decline.  I stuck with water at that point because, frankly, I was too intimidated by this old woman to press the issue.  Such is life!

Love it love it love it.  Whether you're looking for a fantastic bottle to take home or you want to munch on cheese and crackers while you drink and converse, My Wine Cellar has you covered.  The retail portion of the restaurant is really excellent, the walls lined with a huge selection of reds and whites.    If you're intimidated by the selection or are a beginning wino, the restaurant offers "wine education" courses.  My fiance and I attended a weekly "Wine 101" course a couple of years back.  Each week, we sampled a different genre of wine including reds, whites, dessert wines, and champagnes.  Also, each week included a guest speaker, usually a sales rep for a wine maker.  Lots of fun and I learned a huge amount of information!

For the past ten years (ever since FunSports occupied the same unit), this place has been the one-stop shop for my biking needs.  From BMX at age 13 to road cycling in adulthood, SMC usually has what I'm looking for.  The prices don't really compete with larger chains like Performance, but they are reasonable and the service more than makes up for the difference.  When I was getting into road cycling, the guys at the shop were very helpful with selection, fit, and pricing.  A+!

Cardboard crust?  CHECK.  Sugary pizza sauce?  CHECK.  Screaming kids everywhere?  CHECK.  I give Peter Piper Pizza 5 stars because I was once a screaming kid.  My parents would bring me here for my birthday and I would bounce with excitement.  I ate the pizza and seriously thought to myself, "It doesn't get any better than this."  My mom stacked the quarters on the table and I played midget skee-ball until I felt like I tore my rotator cuff.  The incessant dingdingdinging of the games grated my parents, but put me into a zen-like trance.  Sort of like old women at a casino.  Peter Piper Pizza was the stuff dreams were made of.  Now, I think it sucks.  But I'll be damned if I don't take my future kids there when I want them to stop bugging me for an hour.  Come and find me in a few years.  I'll be at the table, a stack of quarters in front of me and a big pitcher of beer in my hand.

I can't believe I'm reviewing Waffle House, but here goes.  If you have never been to a Waffle House before, the food is exactly what you'd expect: greasy, unhealthy, and strangely enticing.  I normally wouldn't put Cheese Eggs and Grits at the top of my "to-eat" list but few things sound better after a night of drinking.    If you have been to a Waffle House before, the food is exactly the same as you remember.  The only distinction this location possesses is that it is very clean.  Pristine, even.  I don't know if it is always so immaculate, but I was shocked.  I'm used to a Waffle House that looks like an unkempt trailer on the inside, not a passable budget restaurant.    The food is really worthy of only two-stars, but this location gets four because when you eat there, you feel like you must be part of some rare historical accomplishment.  My compliments to the janitor.

How do restaurants like Joe's Crab Shack thrive?  Let me tell you a little story.  It might sound like I'm complaining about my (future) in-laws, but I'm not.  I promise.  My fiance's parents love the Crab Shack.  Every year, we all spend a week in Coronado, California for a much-needed escape from the desert.  Every year, we find ourselves driving across the bridge into San Diego in search of a crappy seafood dinner courtesy of Joe and his under-motivated teenage staff.  Every year, my meal both amazes and disappoints me.  How awful is a restaurant when it just keeps getting worse?  I am totally certain that the kitchen contains nothing but enormous bags of frozen seafood and deep-fryers the size of swimming pools.  One time, we had a waiter that kept calling all the men "bro."  I am not your bro.  I am paying for and eating food that would get even a Red Lobster cook fired and, as such, am entitled to no less than five-star treatment.  If there is anything positive to say, it is that the bibs they hand out to people eating crab are HILARIOUS.  I've got the pictures to prove it.  I'll visit the Shack once per year out of obligation.  I'll even be (sort of) happy to do it, considering those close to me seem to love it and I'm not going to rain on their parade.  You will never ever ever ever ever ever find me at one in Arizona, however.  Ever!

I'm into small, low-key, and dark.  Time Out possesses all three of these qualities.  In addition, they've got pool tables, dart boards, and an always interesting mix of people.  Drink prices are reasonable.  When I think about it, there really isn't anything terrible special about the place, but it is just too comfortable not to enjoy.  Oh, the internet jukebox is cool too.

An enthusiastic five stars.  I haven't been to PV in two or three years. The first time I stumbled in, a Pit Bull walked the bar. Like, ON the bar. A thirtysomething army guy on leave hit on my girlfriend ("I just want you to know I'm over there fighting for your freedom"). A mailman chatted me up about how he couldn't decide what he hated more, his job or his wife. I slept in the back of my truck. Bliss.  Then the hipsters came. Until they all descended on Rogue (and then Hot Pink, and then tens of other silly dance club nights), PV was the place to be seen. It was kind of annoying, but at least it was loud. Bars are best when they're loud.  Then it got quiet again. That's cool, too. The drinks were still stiff and cheap. It's too bad I moved so far away.

I've been going here regularly for the past five or six years.  They've recently changed their name, but the menu and taste remains the same.  Get the Bombero if you want a mouthful of awesomeness.  UPDATE: Salazar got bought out and re-branded a while ago.  The food is now of inconsistent quality.  Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's booty.  I occasionally roll the dice, but times sure have changed.  UPDATE #2: A friend let me know that the official Salazar Bros lives again, this time at 48th St and Baseline.  Back to 5 stars, you go.  Easily the best of the Mexican fast food joints.

Let this sink in: the Cardinals are going to the Superbowl.  I've had season tickets for years. I don't say that to distance myself from the bandwagon - that's just an ancillary benefit. But you've got to understand that long-suffering Cards fans find joy in small things. A win against St. Louis? Awesome. A light breeze in Sun Devil Stadium? Thank goodness. A team that approaches mediocrity? Bliss.  I didn't think I'd be going to the NFC championship game. Money's tight, ya heard? But the pops-in-law came through and hooked us up at the last second. We tailgated with a cooler of PBR and then watched the best game of our lives. All I can say is, "FINALLY!"

The Bikini during First Friday is a blast, hands down - probably the best place to hang out in Phoenix. A mish-mash of characters drink and chat merrily together without pretense...well, except for maybe the fake messengers outside track standing and riding in circles.  At any rate, the drinks are stiff, the music is loud, and the decor is simply awesome.  I only fault it for being on the far end of the monthly festivities which essentially necessitates a car ride.

Two things I love about Sprouts: The deli sandwiches and their tropical island fruit mix.  The deli here is just awesome.  Sandwiches are big, cheap, and packed with delicious.  When I worked in the area, I would grab lunch here at least twice a week.  Which brings me to my next, star-dropping point...  Every so often, they'd inexplicably screw up my sandwich order.  I don't know how it happens.  For the uneducated, Sprouts has a seemingly efficient ordering system.  Every ingredient is listed on a piece of paper and you indicate what you would like.  If something doesn't have a check mark next to it, it doesn't get put onto the sandwich.  So why do you put mustard on my turkey masterpiece just often enough to notice?  I don't know how I could possibly make your job any easier than it already should be.  Aside from sandwiches, their tropical island fruit mix is the best of any grocery chain.  If you're into dried fruit, it comes highly recommended.

Mickey's is always packed with the worst people in town.  It smells.  It's loud in a bad way - think a constant stream of brospeak.  I gave it an extra star just because they serve beer (hey, I'm easy to please) but then took it away because they serve Schlitz in a can.  That was a lot cooler when I was 21 and broke, now I just find it in poor form.

I went to Sugar Bowl on September 11th.  2001.  No national tragedy was going to come between me and a chocolate milkshake.  A young girl enjoyed her birthday party while her parents stared out the window.  It was a bizarre experience worth sharing.  More to the point, the milkshake was good.  Tonight, my hot fudge sundae was good.  It's a very basic ice cream dish.  Hard to screw up, even harder to differentiate.  Our waitress let us know she has worked at Sugar Bowl for 40 years.  It seemed sweet, but now I wonder how she has supported herself so long this way.  The walls are a shade of faded pink.  Kind of silly, but who cares?  It's ice cream.

A few years back and before this place popped up in Old Town, I spent a week in New York City.  Having studied my trusty Fodor's guide (pre-Yelp era, of course), I knew that one of the most well-regarded pizza dinners awaited me under the Brooklyn Bridge on Old Fulton St.  Walking there, my friends and I met a lonely drifter who followed behind the group, promising not to stab us.  He just wanted some company.  We found Grimaldi's, said goodbye to our shady new friend, and had a delicious meal.  At the time, I didn't know if I really enjoyed the food or I just really enjoyed that I was eating it under the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City.  I just knew that the restaurant found itself near the top of my "things to tell my friends back home about my trip even though they are just nodding politely waiting for me to finish" list.  Less than a year later, I'm driving down Scottsdale Road and I see the sign.  No way!  The same Grimaldi's?!  My girlfriend and I had to try it again.  Same result.  Delicious brick-oven pizza.  Great atmosphere.  Great wine list.  Another time, I went there for my birthday and they put our group in the "Patsy Room."  If you want a quieter and more separated dining experience, ask about it.  I thought it was nice.  There are some other locations around town, but this one is my favorite.

Back in the days of celluloid (you know, film, the stuff we used to put in cameras), I came to Tempe Camera all the time.  Their processing was fairly priced and I could rest assured my negatives would not be scratched.  Though I now shoot digital and don't have a need for these services, I imagine not much has changed.  Equipment sales are another strong point from my perspective.  The salespeople are always among the friendliest I've ever dealt with and helpful to boot.  Sure, the prices are a little higher than some of the mail-order shops (I spent $80 on a filter I could have ordered for $60), but the smiles and helpfulness make the price difference negligible.  I've never brought a camera in for repair, but have been told that they know what they're doing.  If the other components of their business are any indication, I believe it.

Casey Moore's and I have a complicated relationship.  I don't think there's a better place within 400 miles to grab a drink with friends, yet there are times when I just absolutely refuse to go here.  You see, if I go once, I'll likely have such a good time that I'll want to go again tomorrow.  This cycle will continue and, being a person who thrives on variety, I'll totally get sick of the patio, the (always interesting) crowds, and the food.  I don't want that to happen, so I'll just ration my visits out accordingly.  Casey Moore's is a college bar in the best sense of the term.  When I'm 40, I'll come here and not feel weird about it at all.  If you ask me, that is what  a great establishment is all about.

Bean burrito, extra cheese.  Side of rice.  I have dined at Someburros for a huge chunk of my life (15 years?), and only once have I ordered anything different than that which is listed.  They're exceptionally generous with the cheese when ordered like this and the beans have tasted exactly the same (good) throughout the years.  There's a consistency at Someburros that is to be admired, for sure.  I am especially fond of this location on Baseline and Mill in Tempe.  Being a hop, skip, and a jump away from Kiwanis Park, there is little better than a breezy Sunday playing basketball and later venturing a block down the road for some great American Mexican food.

Lady J. remarked of the, "crappy atmosphere and decor."  I disagree passionately.  It's kind of dark.  Old carpet.  Wood panel walls.  Mexican rugs hung from the ceiling.  Random artwork.  Very small-town, very Arizona.  I loved it.  The service?  Great!  Our waitress and no less than four other employees were very attentive.  Refills were prompt and there were smiles abound.  The food?  Good, not great.  The salsa tasted a little like pizza sauce and my green chile was very runny - a personal pet peeve.  On the other hand, the rice, beans, and tortilla were exceptional.  Our meal was cheap.  I'd go back.

Tuesday is opposite day.  Or is it Thursday?  I don't know anymore.  I'm bored with reviewing at the moment, so I'm going to write this as exactly the opposite of how I actually feel (save for the star rating, which I will rate accurately so I don't mess up the average).  I'll let you do the decoding.  Delux is awful.  I hate that they have Arrogant Bastard on tap.  Their cheeseburgers are a huge step down from Applebees, my personal favorite.  Or maybe TGIFridays is my favorite...life is full of such difficult decisions.  Anyway, the french fries at Delux remind me of deep-friend cardboard: flavorless and tough.  When my server accidentally spilled an inconsequential amount of fry sauce on my twenty dollar jeans, he didn't give me 30% off.  Oh, and I hate the decor too.  I'm not already planning to eat here this coming weekend.

I'm an idiot.  Last year, at the most recent height of my physical fitness after losing 40 pounds, I hiked Camelback Mountain with no trouble.  Sure, it was steep and rocky, but only a token amount of effort was required to reach the summit from the Echo Canyon trail.  Really, if you're in any reasonable amount of shape, you should be able to get to the top easily.  I'm not bragging here, I'm setting up the rest of the story.  Fast forward 12 months.  In March 2007, I had surgery on my hand which limited any physical activity I was really interested in (cycling, basketball, etc).  I used this as an excuse to do nothing until the doc said I could remove the splint.  When I say nothing, I mean I became the guy that eats habitually and groans at the thought of exercise.  Not on my best day would I be found anywhere but in front of the television.  Fast forward 4 months and 15 pounds.  Hindsight being 20/20, my decision to attempt Camelback this morning was doomed from the start.  I played basketball for a few hours yesterday, went to sleep around 2:00am, and woke at 5:30.  Oh, it has been raining too.  That means the monsoon humidity was our unwelcome guest on the trail.  Driving to the mountain, my confidence soared.  I've done it before without consequence, so why should today be any different?  I'll be back in time to make it to brunch.  Halfway up the mountain, I had enough.  My legs, once strong and reliable, were seemingly made of jelly.  My lungs, once capable of withstanding hours on a bicycle, were on fire.  My physical capacity has been reduced to a shell of its former self.  The story I tell everyone is that it is way too hot to be out hiking.  The truth is that I just couldn't hack it.  The mountain itself gets five stars.  As popular as the trail is, I haven't felt overwhelmed with the amount of people.    I'll be back next week for the views and exercise, but mostly to reclaim my dignity.  I can't wait!

Legendary service.  Our waiter killed us with kindness.  And knowledge.  And quick refills.  I don't remember the last time I've had service this good.  The grub was above average.  A little pricey, but not unreasonable.  I think my mole hovered around 17 dollars and I'd absolutely order it again.  Very balanced.  The decor is rad.  At first, I felt like I was walking into a little mission.  Once inside, I found a very comfortable, colorful dining room.  Like Danny said, not much to talk about.  It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant, but it's in the top 10 somewhere.

Nestled in the beautiful Hotel Valley Ho, Cafe ZuZu seemingly has everything going for it.  The layout and decor is just outstanding, with uber-modern details abound.  I really liked the look of the menu which contained everything from signature dishes to old favorites.  Our service was pretty great, also.  But everything smells awful.  OK, maybe not everything, but our plate of mushroom grits (better in idea than reality) and my ZuZu burger reeked to high heaven.  I'm being completely serious when I say that I would hesitate to ever visit again based on this factor alone.  Clearly, I'm never ordering either item again, but now it seems like one big crap shoot.  It doesn't help that the burger tasted awful, too.  Our waitress gladly took it back for a replacement which came promptly.  Replacing their terrible, caked-on bleu cheese with cheddar was the best decision of the night.  Still, my backup burger came complete with a scorched bun, an obvious consequence of the rush.  I guess it could be worse.  They could have charged me for that awful burger I ordered and the mushroom grits could have smelled more like vomit.  Still, my expectations were so high and I left totally bummed out.

Maybe I'm crazy, but this place only gets four stars because, as cinephiles, this is all we have in the Phoenix area.  Madstone Theaters came with better amenities and a continuously interesting selection of films but was doomed to be located in the strip-mall of death (Ray and Kyrene) where only two businesses seem to have survived more than a couple years.  Sure, it's nice to have a place to see independent cinema, but the theater is tiny, translating to a smaller selection.  I can't really knock it because, in this suburban McAmerican region, we're lucky to have anything at all.  Still, it isn't that special compared to theaters in other major cities.  We deserve more!

It's cute.  Thus concludes the positive section of my review.  Bad food.  Here's a joke with an awful punchline:  What's worse than eating soggy vegetables, stale bread, and oily shrimp bathed in pepper?  Paying $40 for it.  ZING!  The joke's on me!

Section 105!  One season down, I can say that there is nothing like watching an NFL game in a sold-out stadium.  The hot metal bleachers of Sun Devil Stadium are a distant, yet painful memory.  Cardinals Stadium (yes, I refuse to use its "other" name) is an oasis in the desert.  See you in August!

Minus one star for being the type of place where you're always asking yourself "ass or crotch?"  Apparently, it can get way too crowded for its own good so you'll be doing some serious rubbing as you navigate through the sea of yup.  On the plus side, the feel of the Roosevelt is super cool.  Very dark and well-kept.  Perfect for a date who doesn't mind talking really loud.  On the super plus side, they have Arrogant Bastard on tap.  I can be easy to please.

Stinkweeds shaped my formative years.  Really.  I started shopping at the (now gone) Tempe location when I was 15.  I had a few older friends into independent music who introduced me to this record store.  I begged my parents for rides and, when that wasn't happening, hopped on the bus for the hour-long trek.  Totally worth it.  100%.  I can't tell you how many awesome bands I began listening to just because I would browse the selection endlessly for something that looked interesting.  If I needed something specifically, Stinkweeds would order it for me if they didn't already have it in stock.  The staff was always welcoming and helpful, sometimes offering their own suggestions.  But it's just a record store, right?  Wrong.  Stinkweeds is the jewel of Phoenix, as far as I am concerned.  Now that it's out in central Phoenix, I make it in far less.  Total bummer!

I'm not the first to review, but I'm the first male to review.  That's gotta count for something, right?  I'm super into Lush.  When my fiance comes home with product from here, I get jealous to an obscene degree.  Most often, she has to hide her purchases from me because if I find a bar of delicious smelling body soap or a tube of facial cleanser, it will be gone within a week.  Book it.  I probably use four times the necessary amount each time and, if it weren't for the travel and expense, I would singlehandedly keep their business afloat.    I've even made it a point to visit their San Francisco location while on vacation.  My obsession reaches unhealthy extremes.  Some guys are into sports, some guys are into guns.  I'm into Lush.  Just don't tell anyone, okay?

My first thought was that the place smelled like my great grandmother's house.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt it worth mentioning.  Anyway, the decor is decidedly retro-Phoenix.  Stevey P. nailed the decade perfectly.  In fact, my date and I commented on how The Cork'n Cleaver looked we had traveled by time machine to 1978.  Again, this isn't a bad thing.  In fact, I thought it was pretty cool.  I ordered a center-cut New York Strip and let me tell you, this steak was awesome.  Perfectly tender and delicious  The accompanying rice also had a great texture and flavor.  I was very happy with my meal.  The salad bar has to be the stuff of legend.  If you're into making yourself monster salads with all the extras, this is the restaurant for you.  If I had one complaint (and this is what brings the review to four stars), it would be that the Italian dressing really didn't taste like anything.  It was like I was eating wet lettuce.  My date, on the other hand, went safe and picked ranch which proved to be a wise decision.  The service was good.  Not the best in town, for sure, but good.  I'll gladly eat here again.

I'm not a sushi expert by any stretch of the imagination.  I like sushi, but my experiences at such restaurants all seem to blur together.  This may speak to how average most are, but only two in the region have ever stuck out.  The first is Sushi Ken, located along Chandler Blvd in Ahwatukee.  I'll save that for another review but, if you have the opportunity, be sure to check it out.  The other is Yasu.  My wife and I had an impromptu dinner here a few weeks back and very much enjoyed it.  We actually had one order of California roll as an appetizer and the first quality I noticed was how fresh it tasted, much unlike the kind that comes in a plastic carton from Basha's.  Upgrade.  The accompanying miso soup had a striking taste without being overwhelming.  For our entree, we shared the rib eye steak.  The steak itself was nice and tender but the highlight were the included dipping sauces.  Delicious!  The restaurant itself is a little cramped for my liking, but it has a very cool, laid-back vibe.  The sushi chefs were busy chatting up a couple at the bar, talking about their favorite items on the menu and just making it feel even more pleasant.  Yasu makes me happy I moved to NE Phoenix.

It's small, but serviceable.  The beer selection is really, really great.  It's actually good enough you forget they don't have anything on tap.  It's loud inside.  This can go either way, but I thought it was fine.  Everybody seems to be having a a nice time of it.  Good DJ.  I'm knocking one star off for the snotty bartender who incorrectly corrected me on how to pronounce Hoegaarden.

My Suns.    As a child, I watched Jeff Hornacek and Tom Chambers take apart the Pacific Division only to fizzle in the playoffs.  As an adolescent, I watched a rotating cast of Barkley, Johnson, Kidd, Finley, et al give their best shot at getting out of the West in one piece.  As an adult, I pull my hair watching the current version of Phoenix's own scratch their heads on defense.  The Suns have never won a title and I really don't care.  For the duration of my life, the moments that have stuck with me have been positive.  Hornacek's silky smooth jumper.  Chambers climbing the ladder.  Barkley embarrassing David Robinson.  KJ absolutely embarrassing Hakeem.  Chapman saying a prayer and having it answered.  Nash finding the open man in heavy traffic.  Hell, even Gar Heard's buzzer-beater at the Garden.  According to my birth certificate, I was minus-seven years old, but I've watched the clip enough times to make it my own.  No matter that we lost the game, the shot sticks with me.  In Phoenix, we like winners.  When the Cardinals or Diamondbacks falter, support dwindles quickly.  The Suns are our team, though, and I'm proud to say it.

The park of my adulthood.  I play basketball here a couple times per week, although that might get put on hiatus since the temperature has recently moved into "um, no" territory.  The hoops have the bounciest rims ever in life, but you learn to deal.  On a Sunday night, the crowd is the strangest ethnic mix, from Mexican to Irish to Arab to Italian to people like me, somewhere in between.  I can't say much for the talent.  A lot of guys play like their girlfriends are watching, shooting every time they touch the ball.  It's still good fun.  The Saturday farmer's market here is pretty cool, too.  I can score a bag of banana chips for a dollar!  It's my weekly vice.

It warms my heart to see all the Trader Joe's locations receiving favorable reviews.  This is the closet one to my home, so this is where I love to do most of my grocery shopping.  If I had to find fault in Trader Joe's, I would find it in the meat selection.  For the vegetarians and vegans among us, this is obviously not an issue.  I, however, find myself at the Safeway in the same strip-mall in search of ground turkey or salmon.  Other than that, TJ's is my favorite place to find inexpensive, healthy groceries.  The inner-anarchist activist in me loves that the store feels like a large co-op.  My inner-capitalist pig loves that it is not.  At any rate, I am a big fan of the store brand which means (from my perspective, at least) great, cheap food.  I'm also into some of the wines there that can be had for as little as three dollars a bottle.  Good stuff!

As a bar, Monkey Pants seems to want it both ways.  They have a 1:00am shirtless shot routine that makes the place feel like an annoying college bar.  At the same time, the atmosphere is decidedly low-key, especially considering the "wacky" and "outrageous" name.  I've been there on a few Friday nights and, each time, could count on one hand the number of patrons.  If nobody is going there, it must not just be me.  Maybe it's better during lunchtime...  Time Out Lounge is in the same strip-mall.  I'd recommend drinking there instead.

Breakfast. It's easy to screw up. Even easier to make it a boring, forgettable meal.  If The Good Egg is the Coldplay of breakfast joints (see that review), Butterfield's is Reign in Blood era Slayer. 100% awesome.  The food is really good (example: California Scramble). The staff is attentive and mostly not annoying. The wait on weekends gets a little long, but who cares? You'll be glad you stuck around.

Don't bother.  The food? Blander than bland. It doesn't taste like anything. I can't tell you if I like it or not. Here's what I can tell you: it was served at a piping hot 74 degrees. Like eating leftovers that sat on the kitchen table all night. Also, the pork in my hot and sour soup (neither hot nor sour) was really spongy.  The service? Adequate, if a little curt. I know someone who went here, ordered a Shirley Temple, and got a "You've got to be kidding me" from the waitress. I only wish I had that kind of story to tell people.  Yeah, don't bother.

For lunch, split a Cobb Salad and Turkey BLT. The sandwich was good. The salad was aiiiiiiiiight.  You know what really bugged me? Five kids standing around behind the counter and nine (count 'em, nine) uncleared tables. I wasn't there long (20-30 minutes), but nobody thought to clean up a little. Super messy and gross.  A shame, because the more I think about the sandwich, the more I think I liked it.

I'm not going to reinvent the wheel here.  A young child's message stapled to the dining room wall says it better than I ever could:  "Thanks for leting us come to your rest rant.  it was god.  i eat my hole plate.  from kevin"  Indeed.

I'm not thrilled with Italian food.  A lot of it is too thick and heavy for me to handle.  A lot of the flavors seem to run together, though this may be an indictment of specific restaurants.  Not to mention nearly every Italian restaurant thinks it offers some rare, niche cuisine and charges accordingly.  Come on, you can find the same boring Italian spot in every neighborhood everywhere.  I do like Carmella's enough to give four stars.  Reason #1?  No predictable, "we're a very, very special Italian restaurant with very, very special food," attitude.  The dishes are basic and tasty.  Not too heavy, not too thick.  The service I've experienced is consistently attentive and thoughtful.  Pricing seems fair for what you're getting.     A good example of a family-owned establishment that gets it right.

The only gripe I have is that it can be hard to find for someone who is eating there for the first time.  I've lived in Ahwatukee all my life so this is not a problem for me.  The Original Burrito Co. is a great little mexican restaurant located in an otherwise forgettable strip mall (A liquor store and Gold's Gym being the anchors).  The food is priced well and you can easily feed two for under ten dollars.  The burritos themselves are generous in size and tasty, to boot.  I really like their green chile and carne asada offerings.  The inside is very small, looking more like a take-out place than a real restaurant.  You can sit outside, however, and I would recommend this is the weather permits.  There is no other place in the area I'd rather get a quick mexican meal, for sure.

I used to take the 51 to see my wife, who lived on the NE side of town.  Now married and a NE Phoenix resident, I've learned a thing or two from this wonderful freeway.  The views are outstanding.  Driving south, you're greeted with a wide and long view of the Phoenix landscape, from Downtown to South Mountain.  Beautiful.  Driving north, you'll enter a stretch of freeway that is sandwiched right in the middle of the Phoenix Mountain Reserve.  Beautiful.  Traffic on the 51 is a myth.  For years, I heard horror stories from my now father-in-law who commutes on this freeway daily.  When I moved to my current hood, I expected my trek to Downtown Tempe to be unbearable.  For months, I just drove surface streets.  In an especially ambitious mood one morning, I decided to hop on the 51.  I've never looked back.  On a bad day, I'll experience very light slowing at Bethany Home Rd, but most of the time the coast is clear.  And this is at 8 in the morning!  I feel weird being so passionate about a freeway.

Thanks to the DPS (or maybe the Arizona Department of Revenue, snicker snicker), this and every other freeway in town sucks. Every two miles it's the same routine: drive by a speed camera, but not before you slam on your brakes because everybody acts like it's the first time they've ever seen it. MISERY.  It still gets two stars because it's close to my house.

This is an appropriate place to go if you want to feel good about yourself.  You spent the week eating fast food, speeding down the highway, and leaving the lights on.  Now Saturday has arrived and you can BUY LOCAL and tell all your friends about it.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't guilty.  In all fairness, this is a pretty cool market.  You can pick up a huge variety of produce along with some prepackaged awesomeness.  There's little more I love than buying a bag of delicious banana chips for a dollar.

It's hard to tell others about this place.  At least the people I know.  I get one of two responses:  "You order a SANDWICH at a Mexican restaurant?"  Yes, a sandwich.  It's not weird.  It's not even unique.  It's a sandwich.  You put turkey on yours.  They put ham, hot dog, carne, egg, chorizo, guacamole, mayo, and pico on theirs.  Okay, maybe it's unique.  At the very least, it's better than that quesadilla you're ordering.  But go right ahead.  More torta for me!  "SUNNYSLOPE?"  Yes, Sunnyslope.  I don't shoot meth.  I've never picked up a hooker.  Yeah, there's a lot of Mexicans.  But I'm Mexican, so maybe I should be offended that you pointed it out.  No, it's not scary.  You don't need to lock your car door as badly as you think you do.  Torta Kings, you had me at, "breaded beef."

They should rename Winter in Phoenix "Hoodie Time."  That's all it is: time to put on a hoodie and get on with your day.  Every year I get three months to forget exactly how miserable summer can be.  On the flipside, somewhere in the middle of July I forget how outstanding Hoodie Time is so, when it arrives, I spend two or three weeks with a big fat smile stuck on my face.  Tomorrow's forecast hovers at a wonderful 56 degrees.  Hoodie Time's final gasp?

A "streetwear" boutique without the pretense.  It's in Scottsdale Fashion Square upstairs by Nordstrom.  King & Duck carries gear from 10 Deep, Crooks & Castles, The Hundreds, ALIFE, Stussy, etc.  They don't have the world's best selection, but it's more than you'll find elsewhere in this town.    It helps that the dudes running the show aren't snotty douchebags, either.  I actually got a smile and a hello when I walked in coupled with a genuine "thanks for coming" when I left with my purchase.  Both more than I ever received at any dime a dozen boutique in LA and elsewhere.

This place is awesome. Wife had the shrimp - I had the Cochinita. Both effing delicious and reasonably-priced. And after reading some reviews, I'm really excited to go back tomorrow and try their horchata. The chips were a little salty for my liking, but the salsas we tried (especially the watermelon) were great. Cool art on the walls.  Seriously - La Condesa is the real deal.
