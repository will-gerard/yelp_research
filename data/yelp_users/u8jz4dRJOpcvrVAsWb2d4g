The place isn't that bad.  It's kitschy because of the pinkish interior, and the ice cream is good.  My only problem is that it's too crowded...thanks to Bil Keane.

I went to the Rogue a couple years ago when Shake hosted a Louis XIV after-party and my friend was guest dj-ing.  I had to drive all the way from my sister's house in Surprise just to go to this place.  I do not like the size of the dance floor.  I could barely get around with a whole lot of people dancing all at once.  The parking sucks, too.  I had to park in the residential area nearby.  The drinks are cheap, though.  We have something similar in San Diego.  It's called the Whistle Stop...and Transport and Booty Basement are its equivalent of Shake.  It used to be cool, but we have bros invading from Pacific Beach.  I wonder if it's similar at Rogue.

I've seen my first NHL game here in this arena almost a year ago.  It was the Valley's favorite snowbird team (the Gretzky-helmed Coyotes) against the Calgary Flames.  My dad, my bro-in-law, his dad, and myself had nosebleeds, but it's still gread despite that the Coyotes lost that day.

I've seen my Broncos play against the Cardinals in this big mothership a year ago.  It is way better than sitting in the hot-ass bleachers of Sun Devil Stadium.  Despite it's name (like the UoP has a college team), it's a great place and I think Arizona needs a stadium like this to protect the fans from the heat.  This stadium is so huge that you could see it from miles away, sometimes all the way from the 303.

Not bad.  Unfortunately, we do not have a Johnny Rocket's here in San Diego (but we do have Ruby's Diner).  The food is typical 50's diner fare with burgers and shakes.  I had a Double Rocket and a chocolate malt.  That was pretty good.  The atmosphere isn't that bad.  It's pretty family-friendly with a 50's motif and a man who makes balloon animals at your table.  The downside is that sometimes the jukebox plays disco music by the Bee Gees and KC and the Sunshine Band.  They should stick to only 50's rock and roll and doo-wop from the early 60's (malt-shop favorites).

Not bad for a megaplex in the northwest part of the Valley.  I took my nephew to go see "Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs".  He liked it.  UltraStar theatres do cater to children (especially on Saturday mornings).  The lobby is decent, with concessions, indoor ticket booth (because it's Arizona), little arcade, and a movie seat sample area that shows trailers for the new Harry Potter movie.  The stadium seating reminds me of the AMC theatres, but what do you expect from an new theatre?  Also, the bathrooms have the new Dyson hand dryers.  I've heard people complain about the snacks.  Advice...go to -the nearby Country Kitchen -the Safeway shopping center across Waddell (with the McDonalds and Taco Bell). -the Fry's nearby (with a Sonic).

Not bad for a restaurant, especially next to a small zoo in the middle of nowhere.  The good thing is that you could enter it without going in the zoo.  The food is decent, but the menu is so minimal.  The best part of the restaurant is part of the namesake: the shark tank.  If you seen that James Bond film "The Spy Who Loved Me", you are probably familiar with Stromberg's shark tank that he transports enemies and traitors to.  At Tiburon, the sharks are a little bit bigger than dachsunds.
