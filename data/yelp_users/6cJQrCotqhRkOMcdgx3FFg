Absolutely amazing. Great food, but the customer service makes this place even better. I was once a chipotle addict, but Pancheros has stolen my heart!

I typically go to the Scottsdale location but tried this one today. I took my family after raving about this place since it opened. We waited 40 minutes for our food and only received it after we checked on it and saw it sitting on the back counter. At that point we asked them to pack it to go. Once getting in the car to leave we checked the order and were missing a few items. Then we decided to see if the food was even warm, it was not. Which makes me think it had been ready for some time but no one brought it out. I was hoping to say scratch the order and just give me my money back, but I was never given a receipt. Now we wait even longer to see what can be done...   Extremely disappointed and don't know that I'll even go to the Scottsdale location anymore.

I only came to this restaurant because I grew up going to Lazy Lou's, the previous restaurant owners. I walked in mostly interested in how it had changed but ended up ordering carne asada tacos and a tostada de ceviche... amazing! Not only was the food delicious, but they had EXCELLENT customer service. I was very pleasantly surprised! I'm already going back for the 2nd time this week.

Originally visited the rogue tomato with friends for a glass of wine and appetizers but ended up spending 3 hours there trying the different foods. All of the appetizers were great and the hamburger was delish! I plan to go back soon to try the crab cakes and a few of the other dishes. Excellent service and great ambiance.
