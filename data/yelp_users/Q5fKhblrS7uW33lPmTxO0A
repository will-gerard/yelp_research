I LOVE NYBB!!! The people are wonderful and accommodating, the food is great, and the bagels are the best I've had west of the Mississippi! These are the real deal, and for anyone who knows and loves good bagels, they need to hear over there immediately.

Since moving to AZ last summer, I have been on a never ending quest to find a true breakfast joint/diner. After reading reviews of Harlow's, I was excited to check it out! Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. The eggs were cooked well, but the chorizo tasted off. The hash browns were unseasoned and seemed as though they hailed from a bag of frozen mashed potatoes. The orange juice, which had been promised to be excellent, was nothing more than a hybrid between Tang and Sunny D. Needless to say, I was less than impressed.  Aside from the food (which is the main component at any eatery), the service was quick and friendly and the ambiance, inviting. If you're heading to Harlow's for coffee, toast and somewhere to read the paper or do homework, it's perfect.
