The most over-priced carpet cleaning in the world. BAIT and SWITCH - 3 rooms $120 turned into my 2800 square foot house being quoted at $1600+. I ended up at $1100 but I can't say that the job they did warrants any of their claims.  My online quote was just under $600.  It was 'okay', but I still found areas and spots untouched. They didn't even pick up a floor fan to clean around and behind it. What a joke.  It took more than 16 hours to be "damp" and 24 hours to dry.  My carpets weren't that bad to begin with.  I felt like a hostage after I planned for 2 weeks, vacuumed, moved furniture and arranged for my children to be gone all day.  They were polite, but certainly not genuine.   PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE JUST SAY NO!!!

After a horrible first experience Zerorez called me and came back to make it right.  If I'd had the second experience first I would most likely rate them 5 stars.  The second tech was honest, genuine and did a great job redoing the areas I was disatisfied with the first time.  I think Zerorez needs to work on consistency, but I will most likely give them another chance because I do think my carpets are cleaner than they have ever been.  Hopefully they will live up to their promise of carpets that stay clean longer.  Thank you for making it right Zerorez.

You won't be disappointed.  No high pressure sales pitches, no contracts, just good, honest chiropractic care.  Always friendly, quick to accommodate and very affordable.  I just can't say enough good things about Dr. Hedrix and her staff.

I would give them ZERO Stars if that were an option.  Went in on Saturday to have additional X-Rays after the Urgent Care couldn't tell from their X-Rays about my son's hand.  They told me the radiologist would call me on Monday or Tuesday with the results - never mind that my son's hand could be broken and that he's been in pain for 4 days.  I call, after hearing nothing to be told that they can't give the results to me and that they would be sent to the referring doctor.  Nevermind that I paid for the tests, nor that the told me that the radiologist would call me with the results.  I held for 15 minutes to be told this only to be told I was being transferred to the branch (Avondale) and was disconnected.  Tried calling back but held for 17 minutes before giving up.
