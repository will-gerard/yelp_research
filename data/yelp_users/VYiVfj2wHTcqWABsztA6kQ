Friggin idiots.  So its 2:30. We ordered a pizza at 12:15 and they swear they already delivered it. We payed with a card, which means they delivered a pizza to an old man (that's what they told us) and the card holder's name is Laura.  They don't show up, AND they charge your card without ID or proper signature? Fuck these herbs. Go ANYWHERE else.

I don't smoke cigarettes. Most people do. You can smoke outside. This place barely has an interior. And that is about it.  I guess the food is ok, but the drinks are outrageously priced and all the tap beer taste awful.  I only go there when i have to.  There is nothing charming about pissing on a fake rock outside, and there is even less charm applied to the fact that it is RIGHT NEXT to the bar. Gross as hell.  More often than not, i go home instead of hit "last call" with any of my friends when they go here unless i am already wasted, thus allowing for bad decisions.

Clean place, food is what it is. The jackass behind the counter wearing the sombrero and yelling really bad lil john impersonations is way too much. Get some class or respect your customers.

Honestly, the best dining experience I have had in a while. Lights were dim, music was unbelievable and the pasta!! I will be here regularly, count on it.
