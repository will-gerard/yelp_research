I recently went came here for a group outing and it was my first time playing laser tag. The staff was fun and energetic which really made the experience great. Since it was my first time doing laser tag I don't have many standards to go off of but we all had a great time and it was very organized. Will definitely be coming back here for future events.

Friendly, quick services coupled with great prices make this an ideal dry cleaning establishment. Check out their website for coupons (5 free garments for first time customers).

I don't know what you can say that hasn't already been said. Not only is Four Peaks the best local brewery in the Phoenix area but their food is nothing short of outstanding. Whenever I have friends visiting the area this is the one spot I make sure to make them to. It gets a little crowded (rightfully so) which makes parking a little difficult but you can always find a spot somewhere along the street.

Really awful experience at the Sail Inn. They charged $10 dollars at the door because there was live music but the band was not good at all. The bartenders were extremely rude and unfriendly. I would recommend going to almost any other bar in Tempe.

One of the better sandwiches in Tempe. I've tried a good amount of their menu and loved everything I tasted. They have a promotion after ASU game days where they give you a discount based on how many points the Sun Devils score (they had 54 on Colorado last night so it's 54% off today). Can't beat that!

As far as on campus grub goes this place is top class. The Boston Dog is a classic here; in my opinion it's their best menu item. The reason I'm so high on this place is that for an on campus establishment it's actually reasonably priced paired with quality food. They are definitely known for their hot dogs but they do have other items (the sliders are good) and are now serving breakfast (haven't tried it yet). If you're ever on campus and looking for a spot to eat, I would recommend Dave's anytime.

Chompies is definitely the best breakfast spot in the ASU area. On weekends you're going to have to 20-30 minutes for a table but it is well worth it. They have a very big menu which usually leads to me spending way too much time deciding on what to order but I'm always satisfied with what I get. Their reputation speaks for itself so if you have not been yet I suggest you go soon.

Brand X is the best option for anyone looking to get custom apparel made. Phil helped me make a large t-shirt order extremely easy and stress free. He was very helpful and responded to all emails in no time.   The staff will work with you to customize your design exactly to your liking. They offer a variety of different quality t-shirts at a decent price. Skip the generic internet t-shirt printing and go to Brand X.

If you are a student looking to buy or sell textbooks go to Student Book Center before anywhere else. From my experience they will give you more for your books than other bookstores in the area. The people who run the store are extremely friendly and personable.

I've been here a couple times for alterations and patchwork. The owner is friendly, helpful and most of all, fast. If you absolutely need something done by a certain time or date she will do her best to accommodate. For the price I don't think you will find a better seamstress in Tempe.

Most people really like this place but I can't say I'm a fan. The food is pretty good and they have decent prices on drinks but I've had some pretty poor service when I've been there. I'm never one to complain about service but it has always been very slow and on one occasion the server told us the wrong happy hour prices and we ended up being charged way more than we were told. Maybe I've just had bad luck here but personally I have not been too impressed.

I was brought to this place by a friend who set some high expectations. Those expectations were exceeded.  We stopped in for a late breakfast on a Saturday morning and only had about a 5 minute wait. It's not a very big dining area and we ended up sharing a large table with another party of two (a couple chairs separating us).  I decided on the "build your own omelette" option which had plenty of ingredients to choose from. They definitely don't short side you on the portions either; my omelette was stuffed. My friend got banana pancakes (a la jack johnson) which were also outstanding.    It's a great local concept and features ingredients from local farmers as well as microbrew 6-packs for purchase. Awesome atmosphere, friendly service, and great food. Highly recommend Hillside to all my fellow yelpers.

I came with a group during Sunday brunch to avoid the lengthy waits at some of the other Scottsdale restaurants and was unimpressed.  It's a trendy little spot in the Saguaro hotel. Our service was very slow which I normally wouldn't complain about but we were one of 3 tables in the entire restaurant.   They had a $30 buffet going but we decided to order off of the menu. I would say the food was decent. This restaurant seems like a good place for hotel guests that don't want to stray too far from their stay but there are a lot of other options in the Oldtown area.

I stopped in here on my way to class this morning and was very impressed. The place is very small (only seats 10-12) but I kind of liked that. I didn't get the servers name but she was very nice and personable. The menu was very simple but they had all the essentials for breakfast. Food was above average and the service was very fast. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes and if you order a coffee they will give you a fresh to go cup on your way out. The only downside was the prices which were slightly higher than your average breakfast but for a location on Mill I guess you should expect that. I will definitely be coming back here in the future.

Handlebar is my favorite bar on Mill. They have a good relaxed atmosphere with great music. It's a nice switch up from the Scottsdale club influence that seems to be taking over other bars on mill. Handle has a great beer selection and their happy hour includes half off brews. If you're looking for some food I'm a big fan of their burger and fries (roasted garlic aioli on the side). I've had questionable service a couple times but it was nothing to stop me from coming back. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for drinks on mill.

Nothing special here. I've been here a few times for happy hour and can't say I've been impressed on any account. I like the concept of the outdoor bar but the service has been sub par in my experience. Don't be fooled by the $1.50 tacos; they come in bite sized portions. I'd recommend trying something else in the area.

I'm pretty indifferent to the restaurants in this area of Old Town; however, CB&C is a treat.   First of all, you know what you're getting. They have a great variety of burgers and plenty of beers to choose from (almost too many). My favorite burger is the steakhouse truffle which can be accompanied by a number of side dish options, I usually go with sweet potato tots. Their other food is good too but if you're going for a first time I'd start out with a burger, they're bound to have one you'll like.   You can tell Cold Beers puts an emphasis on the quality of their food, unlike other places in the area who seem to try and get by off the location and ambience. It can get a little crowded but that's to be expected, especially in the winter and spring seasons. This has become a great go-to spot when trying to grab a bite and watch a game.   Oh yeah, you also get $5 off with a yelp check in!!

I'm a big fan of this new spot in the Mill Ave District. You order by filling in the extensive options on a paper bag which made it very easy to create the sandwich exactly how you want. This place can get very busy during the lunch hours; however, the ordering system allows the lines to move along fairly quick. I would recommend not getting the lettuce wrap option because it can be very messy.   (Yelp check-in gets you a free bag of chips!)

Stopped in for the first time yesterday and I was extremely impressed. I live right down the street from Biscuits but I only noticed it a couple weeks ago.  The menu was fairly extensive and had anything you could want as far as breakfast goes. I went with Joe's Scramble which came with a choice of toast, biscuits, or pancakes. I chose the biscuits (comes with 2) and all my food was very good. I'm not sure if the rest of the menu comes in such large portions but I wasn't even able to finish the whole meal.  Everything was in the $7-10 price range; more than reasonable for the quality. I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially if you don't feel like waiting to be seated at one of the more crowded breakfast places in Tempe.

I was pretty excited to find out they were opening a Zipps in Tempe. There hasn't been a great place to watch sports on MIll Ave so I think this will be a popular spot. It is saturated with TVs which is a good thing I guess.  The food is solid and reasonably priced. They have a good selection of burgers for around $8 with fries (double patty). The fries are just okay but I'd recommend subbing the onion rings if you're in to that sort of thing.   The real draw to this place is their happy hour deals. From 3-7 every weekday they do $3 zipparitas and domestic pints plus some other good deals. There are also specials from 8-close that vary depending on the day.  The first time I went the service was less than great but I've been back and they seem to have worked out the kinks. Zipps is a great place for all; I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone.
