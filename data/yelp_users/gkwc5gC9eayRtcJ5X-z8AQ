I went to Sam's cafe with a group of 8-10 and they had no problem accommodating us, even though the restaurant was packed.  The service was great and the food was amazing!  The complimentary chips and salsa were addictive.  The variety of chips was incredible, sweet potato, multicolored corn chips, and some other unidentifiable but delicious vegetable based chips.  Amazing.  I had a stuffed chicken dish and my date had the carnitas plate.  I tried them both and they were really delicious, but the carnitas was definitely the better of the two.  It was moist and tender, but with delicious crispy caramelized edges.   I didn't hear a single complaint about the food and drink from anyone at the table!  The only complaints I could possibly voice are about the atmosphere.  It was very crowded on a Friday after work and so it was pretty loud.  The sun beating through the floor to ceiling window was a little much, I was blinded for the first third of our meal and it was a little warm.  Once the sun went down, it was pretty great though.  I would go back!

Buono's pretty consistently delivers a good pizza.  The crust is the best I've had in the valley- it's ultra thin and just crisp on the bottom.  The sauce is really great and they are liberal with the cheese, but don't drown the rest of the flavors.  It can get a little greasy, but that's easily remedied with a napkin.  I really love the pizza from Buono's. but I've learned to keep it simple.  The meat toppings (pepperoni, sausage) are delicious and have a nice spice.  Vegetable toppings is when things start to get a little soggy.  I would advise staying away from tomatoes or spinach.  The spinach was obviously frozen chopped spinach and the tomatoes, though fresh, were in large slices with all the seeds and slime- my pizza was a wet mess.  The service is good, but I wouldn't call it friendly.  There is a younger set of employees recently and they definitely have attitude.

This is my favorite Chinese restaraunt in the valley.  The service is fast and friendly and the prices are reasonable.  The staff here is so amazing, I can't stress it enough.  Very recently I called them with a sizeable order late one evening, only 20 minutes before they were set to close. They assured me that it was no problem at all.  When I ran up to their door they were there waiting for me, order in hand, and greeted me by name!  I have tried several of the dishes and I have found them all to be delightful. I frequently order take out and it never takes more than 15 minutes to be ready and is always fresh and hot.  Eating in is equally enjoyable, the service is prompt, they serve complimentary tea, and at the end of the meal they serve a complimentary pastry filled with banana and dusted with powdered sugar.   I've enjoyed the lunch specials on numerous occasions and they are awesome.  The egg rolls here are the best I've had in a long time!  Even at lunch the portions are very large, but are super cheap!  The lunch specials even extend to Saturdays!  Recommended dishes: Garlic Chicken, Golden Gate Special Beef, Mushu Pork, Pork Fried Rice

I've been to Caswell's twice and have been satisfied with the service and the facility both times.  The employees are knowledgeable and helpful.  The facility is clean and well kept, though it is small and at times there is a wait for an open lane, but that is to be expected on weekends.    My first experience here was a class (two years ago) that I took with two friends, "Intro to Handguns".  The instructor was knowledgeable, friendly, and very helpful.  I had no experience outside of revolvers and shot guns, so the instructor made recommendations of different guns for me based on my size and grip- he picked for me what is now my favorite 9mm.  We had adequate instruction (both revolvers and semiautomatic were covered) and range time, and the instructor stood by watching us all carefully and correcting or advising when needed.  It was a really great experience.  Most recently, a friend and I used LivingSocial deals and had over an hour wait, mostly due to the influx of other people attempting to use their soon-to-expire deals.  It was my own fault that we had such a wait- I had called days before and the associate I spoke with warned me of the busy weekends and advised that we come in early to minimize our wait time.  We dawdled and didn't get there until 11...oops!  Even with the wait, the experience was great.  My friend was very new to shooting so we shared a lane and gun (the aforementioned favorite gun).  The Range Officer was immensely helpful and gave my companion instruction regarding her stance and grip.  He was friendly and funny, and most of all he was mindful of his "charges", paying attention to everyone on the range and making sure it was a safe environment.  I will definitely be returning to Caswell's for Ladies Day on a Tuesday or Friday.  The prices are a bit high, but specials like the LivingSocial Deal and Ladies Day make it very affordable.

I am 5'0", so I require a lot of alterations and it is essential that I have a good alteration service.  I will never go anywhere other than Elegant Reflections for my tailoring services.  I have had innumerable pairs of pants hemmed here and have been completely satisfied.  They have nice private dressing rooms with real doors (I refuse to undress behind nothing more than a curtain), everyone on staff is competent and very friendly, the prices are reasonable, and they are almost always able to complete your alterations in less than a week.  I have only ever encountered one issue..when I had two pair of very thick trousers hemmed with a cuff at the bottom, the cuff seemed loose.  Since I didn't want it to get caught on something and come apart, I took them back to be adjusted.  The second alteration was done in just a couple days (in winter, which tends to be a busy busy time for them) and the new stitching was nearly indestructible!  The staff here also seems to have an exceptional memory, because even after a year hiatus- they greeted me by name!

I went to this restaurant for my birthday on the recommendation of a coworker- best recommendation ever!  I was so impressed with the service and the delicious food that I drug a friend visiting from San Francisco there for dinner.  He was impressed with the curried duck dish he ordered, and that they had his favorite imported beer.  He claims that Swaddee is far better than any Thai restaurant he has found in SF.  The prices are reasonable, the food and service is great, and the atmosphere is really nice.   Recommended:  Beef or chicken Prig Khing curry, pork fried rice, red curry duck, and a "Thai Iced Tea".

The food at Kona Grill was good...but everything else sucked.  At about 5pm my friend and I braved rush hour traffic and the mall parking lot in search of some tasty treats before catching a movie.  We were greeted by a hostess who asked us if we preferred outdoor or indoor seating.  It was 102 degrees outside, so we opted for indoor seating.  The hostess provided us with menus and the server was prompt to greet us.  All fine.  But then I noticed that there was no happy hour menu to be found.  I finally asked the server and he informed us that because we were sitting in the dining room, we were not allowed to partake of the happy hour specials.  What?  Happy hour is seating specific?  Are you kidding me?  No.  He wasn't.  He informed us that we would have to sit at the sushi bar (which was full) or outside (102 degrees) to be able to order from the HH menu.  He said we could move, but then didn't want to relocate us.  He finally relented and "got special permission from the manager" to allow us to order from the HH menu.  Menu debacle settled, we ordered the pot stickers, roasted corn and goat cheese flat bread, and the crab crunch roll.  The pot stickers and flat bread came out with no issue and were rather tasty.  My crab crunch roll, however, was wrong.  I informed the runner that brought it to me that it appeared I had been given the wrong sushi rolls.  She responded that "well, they are almost the same".  I don't care how close they are, it wasn't what I fracking ordered!  She returned with the correct menu item and it was delicious.  I also ordered a mango mojito, but was served a regular mojito, and it was awful.  It tasted like pure simple syrup and was garnished with a whole stick of rock candy.  Cute presentation, but it certainly didn't help the already too sweet flavor.  In addition to the specific pitfalls, the service was slow and unremarkable.  I doubt I'll be returning any time in the near...or distant...future.

I used to love Xtreme Bean as a teenager.  Now, nearly a decade later, I am unimpressed.  The coffee is okay at best, the prices are what you would expect from a coffee house, and they offer free WiFi - that's about all the good I can list.  The serious downside is the staff and the ambiance.  On my last visit to the Bean, I went with a friend who is a regular.  The girl at the cash register recognized him and chatted with him while completely ignoring me.  After 10 minutes of chatting laden with profanity, complaining about her employer, the sun, and screaming "F***" while continually asking her coworker at the drive-thru to give her sunglasses- she finally asked him what he wanted to drink.  She then ignored me again.  After literally taking out money and waiving it to her I ordered my drink and a bagel.  All I asked for was coffee with hazelnut added and a bagel with cream cheese.  She got my order wrong.  There was no hazelnut in my coffee, the coffee tasted burnt and old, and there was about a half pound of cream cheese on my questionably toasted (cold but crunchy) bagel.  I MIGHT have even been able to overlook many of the downfalls in service and quality (frankly I'll drink just about anything you call coffee and pour in a cup for me) if the atmosphere had at least been pleasant.  The staff is in charge of music and apparently often uses their personal play list as the music for the shop.  This would be fine if it wasn't being played at a concert level volume.  I like Thrice and other loud bands, but not when I'm trying to enjoy a cup of coffee and conversation.    I'd rather go to Starbuck's across the street.

Best omelet ever.  The O'Pear Grenache omelet was incredible, I tasted my companions and was immediately regretting my choice of French Toast.  The French Toast was really good, but didn't compare to that omelet.  The service was incredible.  The place was absolutely packed, but my table of two never lacked for attention.  What we did lack was space!  The table we were at was TINY, our meals and drinks barely fit on the table. The restaurant itself is not large, it is actually quite cramped.  Don't go here if you are bothered by crowds and cramped quarters.  It's also quite loud on weekends, conversation was difficult.  We went on a Saturday around 10am.  We managed to get a table immediately, but it looked like most others had about a 15 minute wait.

I've eaten lunch here a couple of times and I have been very pleased with my meals.  The service is good, though it seems that the kitchen staff is a little slow.  Don't stop in here thinking you can cram a meal into your 30 minute lunch break.  I have tried a number of items here and found them all to be delicious.  The portions are very generous and I've never been able to finish an appetizer and meal.  Generally I split the hommus and lebne with a coworker, we each get a meal, and we take most of everything home as delicious leftovers.  Check out the bakery, the baklava is decent and it's cheap- plus they have varieties that I have never seen, like almond/hazelnut.  And you can't go wrong with fresh, warm pita!  Recommended:  Hommus, Hommus Deluxe with Lamb, Lebne (best I've ever had), Shish Kabob pita combo (comes with a drink and fries for $7.99), and the Gyro Platter.

I love HTC.  I've been a client for nearly a decade and I've never been disappointed.  I started with my inner conchs for my 18th birthday and just kept coming back.  A septum, two vertical lip rings, both nostrils, both rooks, and several ear stretchings later and I'm still a fan.  Each piercer and staff member I've interacted with over the years has been professional, knowledgeable, and kind.  The facility has always been spotless and the employees practice exemplary hygiene.  The aftercare information that they provide is really thorough and it works.  I've never had an infection, scarring, or any mishaps with any of my piercings (I realize that is mostly due to my actions, but it started with good advice from the folks at HTC).    All said, I have recommended HTC Tempe to many friends over the years, and I will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

I just returned to HTC a few days ago for some new additions to my ears and had another great experience.  The waiting and display area is very clean and has tons of beautiful jewelry to choose from, including a case of gorgeous hand crafted jewelry.  I've developed a serious infatuation with several of the pieces already, and will definitely be making some future purchases.  I decided on my left rook and a double helix, Mat helped me pick out the appropriate jewelry and was very helpful and personable.  He went over the paperwork with me, collected my ID, and verified my information quickly and professionally.  Kevin did the piercings and he was awesome!  He is so funny and friendly that it was impossible to be nervous, plus he did a great job.  I love the placement and it was quick and painless (well as painless as three piercings can be).  They sent me off with aftercare instructions, sea salt, recommendations for a gentle soap and a quick chat about some favorite authors.  I'll definitely be back in 8 weeks to have my other ear done, and I'll definitely continue to recommend them to others.

I went to Jerry's on a recommendation from a friend (or ten) and I am SO glad that I did!  Shopping at Jerry's has saved me hundreds of dollars, literally.  I represent a specific demographic though, I paint almost exclusively with oils. At Jerry's I have found an incredible selection of artist and professional grade oil paints.  Many different brands, every color I can imagine, and tubes ranging from 35ml to the largest tubes of oil paint I've ever seen (great for white and black BTW).    Did I mention the prices!?  Jerry's consistently offers prices lower than the majority of their competitors.  Oil painting is an expensive hobby- on my first attempt to gain supplies at another chain store, I spent over $200 (not including a new easel)  and still wasn't prepared.  I was able to get a far larger supply of paints and brushes (and had a vastly larger selection to choose from) at Jerry's for half that price.  Comparing the prices that I paid at this other store...Jerry's was a solid 25-75% cheaper depending on the item.  Jerry's also has really great things that aren't available at all stores, they have a very comprehensive collection of art supplies.  The staff has always been friendly and helpful.  I have never walked in to the store without being greeted by someone at the front of the store, and more often than not one or more employees will approach me in the aisles and ask if I need assistance.  The store is HUGE, so I really appreciate having someone available to direct me.  The one things that I really dislike is the summer hours- they are super short and inconvenient.  I work full time (bank hours), so it's impossible to get to their facility either before or after work because they simply are not open.  They seem to cater toward students with their hours versus working adults like myself.  Fortunately they are open on Saturdays and have longer hours when school is in session.  Also, some of the more basic supplies that I enjoy (spray on gesso and various spray on varnishes) are often very low on stock or out of stock.  I just make a habit of buying an extra can when they are available- it's really not that big of a deal.    Over all, I love this store and will be continuing to shop there for the foreseeable future.

Most of the food here is adequate, but that's about all I can say.  The service is okay, but not great.  The wait staff is generally nice, but not friendly, and not very quick.  I can say that I was VERY dissapointed by their idea of "bruschetta".  I refused to eat it.  It was pita bread, cold tomatoes, slabs of mozzerella cheese, and avocado.  Awful.

Two of my co-workers and I went to Claim Jumper on a Friday for lunch, we all ordered the fish tacos on the recommendation from our server. I guess ordering fish tacos from a place like Claim Jumper was our first mistake, but this is Arizona and we figured it couldn't go to terribly wrong.  The issues started before we were even seated. We stood at the entrance for a solid 10 minutes despite the place being mostly empty. Apparently no one was paying attention or just didn't care that there were potential customers waiting at the door. We were all hungry so we persevered and were finally seated. As I mentioned, we all ordered the fish tacos. Our server recommended them and said that they were the best fish tacos she had ever had. When our tacos arrived we were not super impressed. The fish fillets on the tacos were tough and just barely warm. The corn tortillas were also tough, almost hard in spots. Everything was extremely greasy and bland.  Our server came back and asked us how everything was, when we told her that it was not good she argued with us! She said that their fish tacos are really good, but of course we couldn't expect them to be great because this wasn't a Mexican restaurant. This is the same woman who had 20 minutes previously told us these were the best fish tacos she had ever eaten! The manager came over and offered us a third off of our bill, we accepted because we just wanted to leave and certainly didn't have time to wait for something else to be prepared.  We asked them to split the bill into three equal portions, which they did without a problem. Two of us paid with cards and one member of our party paid with cash. She paid with a $20 bill (her total was $9) and the server never came back with her change! She just disappeared.  Thoroughly disappointing, I'll never return.

I really love Sahara.  The only issue I ever have with them is the semi-inconsistant hours.  Some days they are open all day, some days they close in the middle for a couple hours, sometimes they close early.  Call before you head out.  The food and service is excellent.  When my coworkers and I venture out for lunch, this is a prime destination.  The service is good, without being the overly-perky-waitress-that-checks-on-you-every-five-minutes.  The owner is incredible, he actually remembers the names of his semi-regular guests, and seems to remember the preferences of our groups.  He really pays attention to his customers, which is really a nice bonus.  The food is just delicious.  The lebne, the hummus, the tabouleh is all great.  My favorite entrees are the Chicken Tikka and the Vegetable Sambousek.  Order the Sambousek as a meal or an appetizer, you will be happy.  It's a rich flaky crust filled with nicely spiced vegetables and potatoes.  The Gyro is also good, several of my coworkers order it consistently, and my mother loves the Chicken Shawarma.  Check out the lunch specials!  They are great for lunch, not too busy around 11-12 so you can take your coworkers and not have to wait for seating to be available.  They have also never had an issue in splitting our checks with no additional fee.  Lastly, do yourself a favor and get a piece of baklava and a Turkish coffee.  It's amazing.

I bought a Groupon for Guru Palace a few weeks ago and just used it this evening, boy am I glad that I did!  The food was delicious, the service was quick and efficient AND really friendly, and did I mention that the food was delicious?  First thing is first, the food was incredible.  My companion and I ordered the Samosa appetizer, Garlic Naan, Lamb Korma, and Chicken Tikka Masala.  I also had an Indian Tea (Chai) which was perfectly spiced.  The Samosa was amazing, the filling was moist and flavorful and the crust was delicate and flaky.  There was just the slightest hint of sweetness to the filling that really perfected the dish.  The Garlic Naan is the best that I've ever had!  I think I could happily make a meal of just the Garlic Naan and not regret it. The Lamb Korma was also amazing, the lamb was tender and flavorful and the sauce was rich and thick.  The Chicken Tikka Masala (a staple in my life) was to die for!  The chicken was super tender and swimming in amazing, thick, rich sauce.  The spice level was perfect in all the dishes- the server asked us on a scale of 1-10 how spicy we wanted our dishes and we ordered a 7.  I can honestly find no fault with any of the dishes I sampled!  The service is really great as well.  I was meeting my companion at the restaurant and I was the first to arrive; the staff greeted me promptly and made sure that I was comfortable while I waited.  As soon as my dinner companion arrived, we were seated and served water and complimentary Papadum with a delicious chutney.  I really liked our server (and all the other staff members that spoke to us), he was efficient and friendly, and happily recommended his favorite Samosa variety when we expressed interest.  During our meal, three different people (one being the owner I believe) stopped by to make sure that everything was good and that we were pleased with our meal and service.  I appreciated the attention, which felt genuine and was not at all bothersome.   The atmosphere in the restaurant was also wonderful.  It is not a large place, but the tables are all well spaced, and the entire place is impeccably decorated.  There is a lot of art on the walls, ambient lighting, soft music, and well dressed staff.  Though it is still a casual restaurant, it's also nice enough to feel really good about taking a date there.   I really enjoyed my meal and service at Guru Palace and I will definitely be returning soon!

I ordered one of Rosati's gourmet pizzas for takeout on a Friday night.  The pizza was pretty good, but had some pitfalls.  The service was okay, but not entirely reassuring when the employee didn't know the menu.  2.5 stars - I've had better, but it wasn't terrible.  As I placed my order I had a couple of questions....namely how much is a 16 inch gourmet pizza?  Instead of giving me this information, he asked me for my order.  Fine- I can always tell him no later.  I requested the 16 inch Pizza Valentino and was quoted $25- wow.  That is an expensive pizza.  I then asked "it looks like there is a pepper compote or something on the pizza, is that correct?" The response I got was "Well, I don't know every pizza on the menu, and that's not really a popular pizza".  Are you joking, you don't know your menu and couldn't just tell me "Let me check for you" ??  I ordered the pizza anyway and hoped for the best.  When I arrived my pizza was ready and the kid at the counter showed it to me to confirm that it was correct, which was nice.  No significant complaints about the service once I was there.   The flavor of the pizza was good enough, there were lots of toppings, not too much cheese, and a nice amount of sauce..  The "thin, crispy crust" that was advertised was all lies though.  The outer edges of the crust were very crispy were burnt (a very dark brown the whole way through and crumbly) and the middle was so soggy I had to scrape it off the cardboard with a spatula.  The middle pieces did reheat nicely in a toaster oven though.  The toppings (Italian beef, sausage, tomatoes, onions) were pretty good, though I would skip the sausage next time, as it had zero flavor.  The beef was actually very good, lots of flavor and very thin and tender.  All in all, I would NOT pay $25 for this pizza.  There are frequent deals through Groupon Now and the store itself though, which makes the price a little better.  Still expensive for what you get, but better.  I won't say that a decent coupon won't tempt me to try Rosati's again, but my first impression wasn't great.

I hired In or Out Movers to transfer my furniture and approximately 20 medium sized boxes from my one bedroom apartment to a condo less than one mile away.  All of my furniture was bare, the boxes were packed and labelled, and everything was stacked neatly in the living room.  I even had the boxes in order by room.  My move was scheduled for noon on November 29th.  They arrived around 12:30 and the horror began.  First of all, they didn't bring tools with them, though I had explicitly informed Terry that I had several pieces of furniture that needed to be dismantled before they could be moved and he assured me that they would have a drill and any other tools needed.  I even confirmed two days before the move that they would have the appropriate tools for the job and still they arrived unprepared.  Luckily, I had my own set and I was able to dismantle my own furniture while Terry and his counterpart did who-knows-what elsewhere.  Every direction I gave was questioned, questioned again, and then ignored.  I was asked repeatedly to move my own items (i.e. "don't you have a backseat that you can put this in?" regarding my television and lamps), and treated to a condescending attitude about some of my less expensive furniture (i.e.: "Do you really want that moved?" in regard to a storage cabinet from my bathroom).  To top it all off they damaged several pieces of my furniture, including completely dropping the drawers out of one of my nightstands on to the asphalt.  I watched as they hurriedly shoved the drawers back in and then argued about it.  In the middle of their arguing and breaking things, they did manage to move my stuff.  Though I did all the breakdown and reassembly, it still took them nearly three hours to move my furniture and handful of boxes!  They each disappeared for up to 20 minutes at a time and several times returned empty handed from trips to the truck.  Instead of stacking several boxes on the dolly and moving them all at once, they moved one at a time.  Considering that I packed and stacked each box myself, and I am a 5' tall female, they could not possibly have been so heavy or cumbersome as to require individual trips on a heavy duty dolly.  The truck was poorly loaded and disorganized, and several random things (like a 2-step ladder) went missing.  Just believe me that it was the worst moving experience I have ever endured.  Find another company, or hell, find some college students and pay them in beer.  They couldn't do any worse.

I have been debating on how many stars to give Lush, because I can't decide if the problem is with the store or if it's with me.  Probably a little of both.  Generally speaking, I do not enjoy shopping, but after recommendations from so many friends I decided to give Lush a go.    My conclusion:  I don't think Lush is going to be my kind of store.  The employees would not leave me alone when I just wanted to look around for literally two minutes.  And all four of them that I dealt with wanted to give me their life stories, their likes and dislikes, and a spiel about how their products are vegan/handmade/from outer space.  I kind of stopped listening after the first minute.  I just wanted to buy my thing!  Also, one of them called me a "first time Lushie" and that made me vaguely uncomfortable.  And they kept touching me, which made me really uncomfortable.  The employees, while clearly enthusiastic about the products, also clearly can't read a customer's body language.  If I jerk back every time you try to touch my arm or shoulder, stop trying to touch me.  If I keep taking steps back and you keep stepping forward into my personal space, it's a problem.    I did buy a solid perfume and it's a nice product, but if I want to purchase it again (or anything else) I will do so online.

This is the Chipotle of pita places, and I wouldn't call that an endorsement.  I've been there twice and Pita Bistro will not be on the top of my list for lunch spots.  My first experience was okayish, I had a gyro wrap with pretty standard gyro ingredients.  The veggies were crisp and the meat was fairly flavorful.  They asked if I would like rice or lentils, I chose lentils...and they put them ON my gyro.  I was expecting a side (the menu wasn't super clear, it just said that the wraps came with lentils or rice) and suddenly my perfectly adequate gyro was covered in lentils.  This wouldn't have been too terrible, except that the lentils were HARD and flavorless and there were a lot of them.  Skip the lentils or rice and it probably would have been alright.  Today I tried a hummus bowl...it was bad.  They take your choice of hummus and spread it all over the bottom of the bowl and load everything on top of it.  In theory this would be fine, but by the time I got to the end of the line my bowl looked like a runny mash up of hummus and vegetables, topped with some lukewarm shwarma.  I was still hopeful until they wedged my tiny slivers of pita bread mostly under the hummus.  I made the 3 minute trip back to my office and everything in the bowl was already soggy and had mixed itself into an unappealing paste.  Some of the individual components of the meal could have been good, but mashed together into a soggy lump I could only made it halfway through my bowl before I gave up.  It's currently sitting like a rock in my stomach and I'm a little nauseated.  The components: Original hummus - a little runny but okay flavor Veggies (tomatoes, red onions, cucumber) - seemed fresh enough, the cucumbers and onion were crisp Mediterranean salad stuff - watery and flavorless except for some parsley Tzaziki - I don't think the liquid they sloshed over my bowl deserved to be called tzaziki.  It was thin, translucent, and just waterlogged the bowl without adding any flavor chicken shwarma - okay flavor, but a little tough pita bread - probably would have been fine if it hadn't been shoved into the hummus soup, but it ended up soggy  The service is standard for any of these production line quick-serve restaurants.  There are a half dozen people behind the counter, straining to hear over the din of the dining room.  They kind of hear your instructions, but they're super busy and a little impatient if you hesitate or ask a question.  I don't actually mind that- I know they're busy and the pay probably sucks- so I'm not going to expect 5 star service.  But the food wasn't good, so I'm not going back either.

I just needed my undercut touched up, so I stopped by Crowning Kings after I was turned away from another barber shop nearby because "we don't cut women's hair." Anyhow...  I walked into Crowning Kings and got a couple confused looks, but very shortly the shop and a couple patrons gave me a welcome. Corey took a quick look at my hair (I had an undercut with a grown out design) and quickly assured me that he could take care of me.  I showed him a picture of the design I wanted, a repeating series of pointed arches, and he had no problem. Corey did a great job.   My undercut is fresh, the design is exactly what I requested, and he gave me his card and welcomed me back for even more creative designs!  The atmosphere is definitely not my usual salon, but everyone was in good humor. The staff and patrons joked and talked about food, family, and girls. Not long after I climbed into the chair I was brought into the conversation and even teased a bit. It was fun and I'll definitely be back!
