How is this place in business?  Seriously!  I'm still angry over how bad this place was.  My brother who was with me agrees.  So here is what happened...  We sit down, look over the menu and instantly notice that the place is super expensive, even for lunch.  Then my brother points out that everyone sitting down seems to be over the age of 50 and eating huge piles of colored salads.  I'm guessing this is the turkey salad.    My theory is that for the price everyone went for quantity.  We skipped the original plan for sushi and rolls because at $12 - $15 at lunch this place did not have the atmosphere or the token chefs to warrant those prices.  We decided to start easy and try the Panko Udon noodle soup with tempura.    My false expectation:  Thick udon noodles, in a nice translucent dark broth, with tiny green onion bits floating on top, paired with a plate of assorted vegetables covered in a light fluffy batter.  Add battered shrimp or fish depending on the place.  All this would then combine in my mouth into that great saliva generating Udon freshness that I have come to love.    It arrived...  -INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE-  The not even joking reality:  Placed in front of me was a white bowl of soy sauce with a pile of store bought rough spaghetti noodles.  Floating in this disappointment was a horror show of deep fried unrecognizable straight from the freezer bag vegetable shapes.  I say shapes because vegetables  usually have flavor which is the whole reason for including them in a dish, these could have been cardboard cutouts soaked in grease.  I wish I was joking about the soy sauce or the noodles.  It tasted like something a Home Ec student from Beverly Hills would have made first day of class.  -INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE AGAIN-  Well we didn't find the hidden camera and only got a few bites into the mess before giving up.  Here is the best part, the bus boy was not at all surprised when he picked up the plates mostly unfinished.  Weird wait staff aside, Shogun is absolutely hands down the worst Sushi place I have ever eaten at.  If you can't do Udon Soup don't put it on the menu.  They should be ashamed for taking that much money from innocent people who don't know what good sushi tastes like.  Avoid the disappointment and save yourself some money.  You're better off at East Wind 1 mile north at Thunderbird and Tatum.  Better yet head to over to Hiro Sushi at Shea and the 101, its absolutely worth the drive.  -INSERT FINAL EXPLETIVE HERE-

I bought from MDI Rock twice, they were friendly and genuinely concerned about customer satisfaction. When we had a hiccup with too much sand being delivered for my daughter's sandbox, they took care of the issue and made sure the problem was corrected.  I'll buy from them again.

If you're looking for a mesquite flame grilled burger (or chicken) and you value the taste and quality of the meat as well as the overall grill flavor of the burger....  Then the Chuck Box is the only place to go in Phoenix.  There is a reason its packed at lunch.  There is a reason its been around for years while other places come and go.  There is a reason the locals swear by it.  There is a reason the atmosphere is minimal and the main draw is the burger.  The Chuck Box burgers are that good.  Why are they that good?  Its a mesquite open flame grill that has not had time to cool down in 20 years.  Trust me the burgers are moist and oh so full of that grill flavor.  As far as Mullac's review: Garbage, his other reviews are of bistros, not a burger expert.  As far as the condiment bar, its minimal because the burgers are 1lb and trust me when I say they only need minimal condiments to add flavor to the burger.  He prefers "flat griddle-surface" for a burger, that disqualified the review right there.  Oh and Lauren: Its busy during lunch because its that good.  If the burger at the Chuck Box was OK where did you have better?  Sorry I love food, and the Chuck Box got me all through college and is still a favorite.  Yes I created a Yelp account just to write this review.  Look at all the people who know what they're talking about, all the ones rating Chuck Box a 5.

This was my first time to V's, I went because my normal barber was not available and V's looked like a place guys should get their hair cut.    My barber was Nissan, we started off with the usual prep work.  Ten seconds into the hair cut I realized V's was a place every guy should get his hair cut.  Think 30's Chicago style mens barber shop, minus the cheesy candy cane.  V's has an absolutely guy atmosphere that makes you feel like a man should when hes getting his hair cut by a barber not a hair stylist.  Nissan gave me the absolute exact hair cut I asked for and pulled it off better than almost every other barber I've ever been to.  He asked questions which I like, then he cut my hair just the way I like.  The process was quick and relaxing, I watched TV and exchanged brief chit chat with Nissan here and there.  The man took absolute pride in his work and I didn't need to micro manage his every snip.  The results actually made me grin.  Nissan works M W F, ask for him but the other guys looked just as sharp.  If you've ever seen an old movie and thought, whatever happened to a mans barber shop, you know the ones with class?  Go to V's.    I walked out of there with not a single hair on my shirt or back.  I felt and looked like a million bucks.  The $21 hair cut was more than worth it, next time I'm going for the $45 full deal.  Warning: V's is not a hair styling salon, its a man's barber shop.  If you're a man go here, if you know a man, send him here, and if you don't know a man, get one, then send him here.

You know when I like to drink my coffee?  In the morning, when this "coffee shop" is not open.  No opinion on bike shop. Made me drive off the freeway for a cup of coffee before work, only to note they open at 8am. When I'm at work.

City North is finally complete and it comes with its very own coffee shop.  For having been open a month or so the place has a dozen or so patrons milling around at all hours of the day.  I stopped by because I was tired of going to Starbucks and I've been coming here to work and enjoy hot beverages ever since.  WIFI is free for patrons but the crowd is more upscale than techy.  What do they serve you ask? Everything coffee, tea, chocolate, imported beer and wine.  Plus a great lunch menu of fresh sandwiches and salads that could pass for a decent meal at a gourmet bistro.  The coffee tastes great, not burned or excessively sweet.  You even get to drink it out of those cool San Francisco style over sized mugs.  The wine selection is around 30 different light and dark bottles between $5 and $16 a glass.  Check out their periodic wine tastings.  Food and drink aside any good cafe needs good atmosphere, and this one blows everything I've seen out of the water.  I genuinely want to be here at all times of the day.  Located on a quiet corner of the shops the large windows open during warm days onto a shaded terrace.  Facing the windows is a great granite bar with tall stools for sipping lattes and working on your Mac laptop.  Great for people watching.  Towards the back is a large oak table for group meetings while the front of the shop has a comfortable leather couch for relaxing.  The whole space is well lit by soft light thats easy to read by but elicits the best cafe atmosphere.  Evening include candle light, has to be seen to get the full effect. The music playing in the background is very good and the staff is absolutely amazing.  I've been here three times and already I'm on a first name basis with a few of the employees.  They're informed, helpful, and eager to make sure you have the best experience possible.  Its like this place has been a local spot for years.  So if you live in the north valley, skip Desert Ridge, forget Starbucks, and head straight to Press at City North.  Plus theres a Kona Grill within walking distance so you can spend all day here then go out for the evening.    I reserve my limited review time for places that absolutely positively rock, this is not an exception.

Great drip coffee and great quick breakfast bagel sandwiches.  It reminds me of NY, down to the staff.  Definitely one of he better breakfast spots in the area.  Has couches and tvs in case you need to catch up on your morning news.

I just ordered a Dewars before a Garfunkel concert. The bartender took out a "soda gun", pushed a button and "dispensed" my scotch/whiskey blend. Classy!  It was a 1oz pour, literally wet the bottom of my plastic cup about a 1/4 inch tall, slid it over and asked for $7.50 plus tip. Mouth watering!  Do you tip the guy at Wendy's who dispenses your soda? Needless to say for a casino to reduce something as basic and enjoyable as ordering a scotch to this, bullocks!  Don't typically leave negative reviews, drink before you get here.

I've been a regular at Press Coffee for years for several reasons.  I love the atmosphere, very clean and bright in a warm way.  The only thing you really need to know about this place is that the staff and the owner is absolutely passionate about roasting and brewing coffee.  I've watched staff debate the absolute best way to brew a specific cup.  I've been asked to try a new brew method or grind and have yet to be disappointed.  I've talked with Steve ( one of the owners ) about his trip to South America to meet with coffee growers directly.  I've been impressed.  The true tell on how great Press Coffee is and why so many people love it is that I can drink their coffee black and it tastes amazing.  I've gone to so many places that pour asphalt into a cup, add corn syrup plus white color then call it coffee with a kick.  Its called not having to pay for good baristas because we serve corn syrup with caffeine.  So next time you're there try one of the cups black, I recommend the Amarro Gayo.  In between the rich earthy coffee flavor, you can actually taste the coffee's natural sweetness.  Press is one of the few places in town that has enough passion about coffee to be brave enough to serve coffee that way.  PS: Lea C. Give it some time, after sucking down high fructose tar at Starbucks you tend to forget what good coffee can taste like.  Once your taste buds come out of hiding good coffee will come back to you.

Co+Hoots is a co-working space.  Meaning you can walk in anytime sit down and do some work on your laptop.  Yes you can do that at a coffee shop but sometimes you need a place that feels more your own.  The space is located in a historical building.  Imagine walls of gothic windows set in unfinished turn of the century brick.  High ceiling and open spaces make it a pleasure to sit down at one of the desks and concentrate on some work.   The place is super clean, and the owner "Jenny" is a designer so its got a very cool gallery feel to it.  The space makes it easy to work and concentrate, it has the right feel and good creative vibe you see in movies.  A big plus is PARKING!  Yes its in downtown phoenix and it has its own parking... I know.  Full bathrooms, a water cooler, and even a serve yourself coffee and tea stand are available.  I usually park there and leave my car when I walk to lunch.  Local coffee shops and lunch places are within walking distance.  Across the street you have "Roosevelt Row" with breakfast, coffee, food, beer, and even a full bar.  Its nice to walk over and take a break.  If you stand up and say "I'm going for coffee, anyone in?" you'll instantly have half a dozen cohorts.  You can walk in anytime and just ask for a desk on the spot, but they have monthly rates too.  If you're looking for a quiet comfortable place to work, give this place a try.  Its hard to describe but you'll find yourself coming back, its just a great place to work.

This is one of the few places in town that has unique teas and understands the importance of roast and brew technique on coffee.  Great atmosphere is nice for hanging out in downtown. Always running into fun people.  I promise you'll try it once and love the coffee.

Great coffee, amazing iced tea, and one of the few coffee shops to serve pretty spectacular lunch Tamales.  If you get a chance hop off the light rail for a morning brew between Tempe and Phoenix.
