umm I will never go here again and never recommend this place..  In fact 2 of my other friends that went on different days than i did agree with me on this one...  I had the special combo sushi roll meal thing they had and it was really bad.. I felt soo hungry after eating lunch here that I ended up having an early dinner...

I wasn't too impressed with the food-- we got stuff to go from here. Ordered the lamb and mint pastry and the chicken mozzarella pastry. We also got the chicken tandoori salad. When we got back home and set everything up, the tandoori chicken was there but there was no sauce and no salad--- just two lonely pieces of chicken--- so much for that dinner!

Came here for the happy hour specials --- ended up paying as much or even more than what we would pay in a $$$ restaurant for 2 people (we only ordered from the happy hour menu) Pretty pricey I must say, but everything we ordered was just great! You have to trying this place!!

Service is superb! I love all my servers.. I came down each day for breakfast and had 3 different servers.. 2 out 3 were fabulous!   However, there was no variety in the food selection--- who wants to have the same exact breakfast every single day? Everything was the exact same unless they were out of something then they would just take that off the menu but they wouldnt replace it with anything else!   Food was simply okay and if you were paying $20 for breakfast that has no variety, I think you are better off going to something down the street!

Loved this place! I had the salmon burger-- the burger was super delicious! Highly recommend this place -- not too expensive either roughly 25$ -$30 per person

Surprisingly good! We were hungry at 11 pm so we walked from our hotel to this pub!  I ordered the sweet and sour sauteed shrimp as a wrap and it was very good! My friend had the veggie burger and she could not stop raving about it!

I came here and ate the santorini crepe. It was really good. Definitely would love to try more crepes out from this place, but unfortunately I do not live there to be able to keep on swinging by. My only problem was that I was the only person that was in line, and he took 5 minutes just to ring me up (I had pre-ordered and my food was already waiting for me-- it was kinda cold, even though I ordered it 10 minutes before I got there). Nonetheless, the crepe tasted great and I would definitely be back.. just not sure about coming here when I am on a time crunch, especially if there will be more people waiting in line.

So this place had a special check-in offer (just a free drink with your order). However, when I went to redeem it, it did not say dine in only, but the manager or owner said he cannot take the coupon if I do not dine in. I honestly did not feel like dining in after a long drive up there. I just wanted to go to my hotel, eat, and crash. Nonetheless, the beef shawarma I had was great! I ordered to go from here twice in the two days that I was there and I enjoyed my meals.

Best shawarma I have had in the U.S.! No questions no doubt about that! A damn good shawarma!   So the restaurant was pretty empty on a Monday night. But I really enjoyed the food--- ordered lamb and chicken while dining there and got the shawarma to-go! We also ordered some baba ghanouj (which was okay-- not that great! I have had better), and some yogurt on the side!  In general the serving sizes were huge! There was definitely plenty of rice that came with the food too!   Everything was great! Loved it!

Can I come here every week? Gosh, the wait is horrible, and the service was bad, so maybe not! However, the food was on point! my favorite, the brie apple with figs and dates with pistachio.   I called to see how long the wait will be and told them I want to be in and out pretty quickly-- she responded that if I get there in 15 minutes, I should be seated within 15 minutes, I got there in 15 minutes and had to wait 45-60 mins for my table. We could have still made it to our other plans had our server showed up on time--- but he didnt even welcome/greet us for 15-20 minutes after we sat down... We ended up having to cancel our other plans, which was the most annoying part...
