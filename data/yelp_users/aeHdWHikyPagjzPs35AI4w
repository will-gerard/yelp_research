Food is great but the staff not so much. A lot of attitude from multiple servers. Tempe location is much more friendly and a better environment.

Went online to check this place out and it didn't fall short of my expectations. Jacob gave me one of the best cuts I've had in a long time. He paid attention to so much detail and didn't let me walk out of there until it was perfect. Would definitely recommend him and this shop.
