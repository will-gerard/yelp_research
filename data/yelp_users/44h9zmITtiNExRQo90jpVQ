We came in at 9 am for a drop off and no one is in here. The one person is outside showing a car rental. You would think it would be best practice to have more than one person working today. The phone line is ringing like crazy. I feel bad for the young girl who is working by herself. She is doing great under this pressure but it isn't fair to her. Enterprise should be have a procedure when there is only one person working.   Rented a dodge and it was dirty. It was not cleaned before us. There was pet hair and stains on the cup holder. I had to go home and wipe the cat down myself. I cleaned off most of the hair left in the passenger seat. It was very disappointing because we normally have a great experience.  Update- at the time of drop off for rental I was given a discount due to the car being dirty. I was not expecting this so this made me happy that the representative understood my frustration. Kudos to the one gal working!

Came through the drive through to order ice cream and the machine is down. I understood. I looked at the menu to see what other desserts I can order since I drove here. I ordered two Apple pies and the girl who is taking my order says there are no Apple pies because someone just ordered some. I asked to speak to a manager and he said he can make them for me but it would take 10 minutes. I said I could wait. I waited 15 minutes before I had to leave my car and walk in to see what was taking so long. I asked for the managers managers phone number but was told he cannot give that type of info out and I would have to call tomorrow.   Worst customer service skills ever this manger had. No sympathy...he just wanted me out of his sight...

Dr. Gonzalez truly cares about me and my dental health. She is very honest with me and I appreciate that. Dr. Gonzalez and her staff make me feel so comfortable every visit. When I first met Dr. Gonzalez I told her about my anxiety with the dentist. She was able to work with me and make me less anxious and comfortable.  I know that the fear is irrational and I can't do much about it but she is able to calm me down. No dentist has ever made me feel comfortable and less anxious. Thank you Dr. Gonzalez!   I love that the scheduling is catered to when I am able to make it in. The office is always clean and the office staff are always so happy and eager to help.

We were seated outside patio area for about 20 minutes. No server came outside to greet us or serve drinks. I had to get up and let someone know we were outside and no one has been outside to take our order or offer drinks. When I stated this the server said oh I don't think the person who sat you outside told anyone you were sitting in the patio.   No apologies or discount. We won't be coming back.

Dr Nicholas John Argyros, MD, FAAP is an amazing caring Dr. We took my daughter in a few weeks ago who was diagnosed with pneumonia. Dr. Argyros gave me his cell phone number to call him directly to give updates on my five year olds progression. No doctor has ever went out of their way to call me to check in on my daughter. He has proven to be caring and he is passionate about what he does.

I made my appointment yesterday and was able to be seen the next day. I brought my 8 and 5 year old for eye exams and we have had the best experience. The facility is up to date with today's technology. Student intern Lidia Tekie was so caring and attentive to my 5 year old who was nervous. They played with each other until my daughter was calm. There were iPads that were available for use. I have made this facility outer official eye doctor. Both Victor Calderon, OD and  Roger Juarez, OD were amazing with my kids. They are truly passionate about providing the best care!

The only thing I enjoyed was the atmosphere. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was okay. I've had better in a whole in the wall bar. Tasted a bit water downed. For brunch I ordered the Hawaiian French toast and was able to chose bananas or strawberry for an extra 1.99. I was told that they didn't have bananas so forced to go with what they had. When I received my plate there was literally 8 chopped up pieces of strawberry for 1.99 the price doesn't seem reasonable. I also ordered the spinach omelet and there was nothing spectacular about it. I won't be coming back it want worth the money...

Horrible wait lines. Three cashiers and two lines not very efficient. Clothes were everywhere and not on racks. These wait times are ridiculous

We live in Avondale and our friends who live in chandler told us about this place. We had the el Diabloito and it was the best tasting treat. You have sweet and sour all in one. I can't wait to go back.

Food was absolutely amazing!!!!!We ordered different entrees tonight and so happy with all of the choices. We loved the Greek fries. I've never had fries like these these are a must try. The lamb was so juicy and tender. For dessert we had the cheesecake and it was delicious! I cannot wait to bring my family to try Zetas Grill.

Love love love the pizza! The pizza is so fresh and flavorful.   The staff is super friendly. I like that there are fun activities to keep the kiddos occupied like coloring books and board games.
