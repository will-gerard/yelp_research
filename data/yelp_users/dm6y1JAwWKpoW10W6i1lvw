I've been here twice so far, both times for dim sum, and both times I've gone home happy, visions of pork buns dancing in my head.   I'm glad that my first trip was with a regular, or I wouldn't have known what to order. In fact, my only complaint is that the servers offer only a breif description, and there is no printout with what is offered on each cart. Other than that it's a fun and inexpensive way for you and your friends to try something new.

I don't think there's a better seafood or steak place in the city.   If you're undecided on what to try, consider...  Any size fillet, oscar style  Chilean sea bass  Salt and pepper tuna  Diver scallops   Pair anything with the mac and cheese or mushrooms.  Sides are meant to be shared   Start with tuna tartar or fondue, and end with the peanut butter pie   OP's wine list is very nice, but I think everyone should try a pinefin on the rocks at some point.

Maybe I just went on a bad night, but I was very let down and a little confused by Blue Martini.     I had been next door to Ocean Prime (which is excellent, by the way) plenty of times, and Martini always looked packed.  "There has to be a good reason for that," I figured, and while I'm in no way a "scene-ster," I just can't resist exploring the hot spots that get the locals buzzing.  Typically there's something great going on, and I don't want to be left out.  From the street outside I see expensive cars parked in front, which is nothing new at City North.  My friends and I pass by the crowded excitement on the patio to make our way to the line at the front door.  Entering the building, all hype quickly vanishes.    It's replaced by the realization that the bar itself is extremely average, and the crowd is a hodgepodge (yeah, I said it!) that spans about 40 years.  I saw forty-something men shaking it on the dancefloor, or crowding tiny tables drinking over-priced dekuyper-laden martinis, while average-looking twenty-something girls try to catch a glimpse of their money clips.  Welcome to Scottsdale!   But that's not all.  There were at least two tables full of looky loos in their early sixties, and a small bachelorette party getting trashed by the patio.  There were lots of low-key types just chilling with their wine and their friends, and it seemed there were very few people that went there intending to dance all night.    Don't get me wrong...I'm all about diversity.  I was just a little shocked to see why the bar is always so packed; because LITERALLY everyone and their grandmother hangs out there.  I'm used to bars that are known hotspots for older singles or younger singles, or places that are specifically for dancing, or very accommodating to people who want to chill and talk with friends or their date.  Blue Martini is, unfortunately, trying to be a home for all types.  That might seem like a smart idea, but when people look around and see it as an incohesive mess, they realize that Bar X-Y-Z is more for them, because it caters specifically to them.

Nickname: Blue-hair-tini.  When I was eating at OP last week, I saw a group of five 40-somethings heading in, wearing skirts shorter than any I own.  The mix in that place is so bizzare.  Good for Rose and Blanche for finding a place though

Loveland is the best!   Visit once and you'll be hooked.   This is one funky boutique that really does have something for everyone, even your pup, and especially your little ones. The clothing and jewelry are unique and stylish, and the trends really aren't too pricey. I mean, who can put a price tag on looking fabulous, right?! (By the way, thanks again, Mom) Also, you HAVE TO sign up for their mailing list, because they not only alert you about upcoming sales, but also events, like jewelry making classes   I really had a blast chatting with Jinia and playing with Beans, and found some really great dresses on sale. I've been looking forward to my next trip before I even left the store during my last trip.   If I could pick one store to max out my credit card at, it would be Loveland. Is there any better compliment than that?

I'm writing this from memory as it's been close to two months since I've dined at Petite Maison. I'll be sure to write a more detailed review immediately after my next visit, which I hope will be soon. For now, I just want to mention what stands out the most in my memory:   The building itself is small and charming. There are a few table outside, about 7 tables inside, with maybe 10-12 spots for dining at the bar. Some will say it's crowded. To them, I say go back to Fridays and put your name in for a booth. This is a very romantic, intimate dining experience, if you can get a table. If not, dining at the bar is sure to be a treat here. We were able to spend some time with the bartender after our meal, and like the rest of the staff, he was really a pleasure to chat with.    You'll notice that everything on the menu sounds fantastic, so deciding on something may be a challenge.  Their wine list is really terrific, though, so at least paring your drink with your meal will be easy. Everything that we tried that night was delicious. On our way back to the car I decided I was walking out of my new favorite restaurant. I'm so excited for my next trip, especially if I get to attend one of the "staff meals."

I'm sorry to say it, but the only two things this place has going for it are a cool name and toasty buns. Even the sauce on the table was beyond dull. (I swear it's 85-90% ketchup.)   I wasn't very hungry, so I decided on the slider app. They offer several different choices, including pulled pork, brisket, chicken and hot links. I picked 3 different ones to try, but naming them won't matter because none of them were anything special. I'm a sucker for a good, toasty bun, though, so I had something to keep me going. I was thinking to myself that if the food was good I would try a slice of pie to top off the meal. The food was boring, so I can only imagine the pie is a dud too.   Putting the food aside for a second, I think the restaurant is pretty neat looking. It smells great. It's got a good location. I just wish the food was as great as the name.

Poor Bill. He was really craving wings yesterday, and rather than stop at one of the nearby favorites, we checked Yelp to point us in the direction of the best wings in town. We wanted to try Long Wongs, after reading some reviews that said many people considered the wings here as their favorite. We again, for whatever reason, decided to pass on a few closer LW's to experience the one in Tempe.   It was easy to find, and at 3:30 in the afternoon there was no issue parking. So far, so good. We decided to sit t the bar, like we often do, and I think that was our best decision of the whole trip, because the bartender was fantastic. I wish I would have asked her name, because she's the only reason LW's gets 2 stars instead of one.   Bill and I both ordered a beer on tap and looked over our (paper, printout) menus. There were a few things that sounded good to me but I wanted to stick with the plan, so I got a dozen boneless wings and Bill got a dozen bone-in. He got half hot and half garlic parmesan, and I got half spicy BBQ and half garlic parm as well. No one gave me a hard time for ordering chicken nuggets with sauce, so I once again figured "so far, so good."   Our food came out in styrofoam containers and solo cups, along with plastic bags of what would be carrot sticks if they were twice as fat, and some ranch dressing (in solo cups) to dip them in, I anyone even bothered. The garlic parm sauce bears a curious resemblance to plain old ranch dressing. Don't bother. The hot sauce and the spicy BBQ were ok. Nothing great. The boneless wings made me feel like a kid. At least BW3 serves something breaded, and roughly the size of the big kid's wings. Bills wings were kind of small, and he said they were overcooked. If it matters to any wing fans, he got mostly wings; one one drummie of each sauce. He was happy with the ratio, or at least he would have been were they better.   We won't be back for food. If there's any small chance either of us go back at all, it's because we're in the area and want to have a beer, but even then we might just pick one of the dozens of other bars in the area.
