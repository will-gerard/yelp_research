Their eggplant parmesan was BOMB DOT COM. I also had a cup of the cappuccino and really enjoyed it. The atmosphere is really neat because you are eating in a grocery store. Love it.

Lee's Sandwiches has always been a pleasant place to go since it opened in Chandler years ago. From what I remember it was cheap and delicious. When I went back today, I found it to be cheap in a different way, as well.  I ordered the #17 (Jambon and Pork) on a croissant and a large thai iced tea with no ice. 2 items, $9. Not quite the Lee's I remembered. They called my number and I walked up to get my food. Croissant sandwich, check. No ice in my drink, check. Thai iced tea...half check. My large cup was only half full (not being optimistic). Quite literally half full. I picked up my cup and asked where the rest of my drink was and was told that I ordered no ice (well duh). I told him I didn't order "no drink" and he said he wouldn't give me what I paid for.  Very very disappointed. The only thing that saved Lee's from 1 star was the delicious sandwich.  Food - 4 stars Customer service - no stars

Dr. Liu is easily the best dentist that I have ever had. From his knowledge of dentistry to his approach to patient care, everything he does he does to the highest degree. One thing he said that really put me at ease and helped me realize this was, "if you have any pain, then I haven't done my job."  Dr. Liu will literally walk you through your oral history and offer suggestions and helpful hints about your oral health. I feel like I just walked out of a dentistry conference after visiting Dr. Liu. I am confident anyone who visits him will leave infinitely more knowledgeable of their own oral health. For once, I am looking forward to going back to the dentist!

THE BEST hot dogs I have ever eaten. The Wild Willy w/ peppered bacon is BOMB DOT COM. I want to try everything but when I get there I just want to have the Wild Willy. Randy (the owner) is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet. Talk to him and you will find that out yourself. Wonderful food, even better man that cooks it for you. Really really suggest you try this place out if you've never had it. Like you probably see in other reviews this place is actually inside of an antique store. So don't drive past it! Make sure to go in and get a hot dog and then check out all the neat things inside.

The menu here is similar to the other Vig locations and the food is well up to par. However, the service here is spectacular. What could have been a horrible meal was turned into a great experience. A simple mistake with my food was fixed and then some. The staff here will make sure you are well taken care of!
