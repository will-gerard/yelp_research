Vien is amazing, the technicians go above and beyond!! My nail tech was a guy I didn't get his name but he was a real perfectionist. He took his time on my nails and did a great job, I couldn't of asked for a better tech. When I walked in I was greeted right away, there was a bit of a wait time about 20 minutes. I can't complain because when,it was my turn my tech listened and did exactly what I asked for and when I didn't like the design he would do it over to make sure I got what I wanted. This place is great and you absolutely cannot beat the prices!!! I got 2 acryllic colors and a gel base with a simple design and it was on $50 including a $10 tip. Incredible, next time I go I'm definitely trying out their pedicures. Wonderful neighborhood place with really great people.

The Fall From Sushi Grace!!  Kampai used to be my favorite sushi restraunt, there fish was very high quality and purchased fresh everyday. Now Kampai is simply meteocre, the new owners have completely changed the menu, sushi chefs, and the quality of fish has gone down drastically. Honestly I would not go back to Kampai now based on price alone, they are just to expensive for the low quality food that is served now. Less is definitely more as far as the old Kampai goes, their menu was simple and so were the ingrediants in the rolls. If you do choose to try out the downgraded Kampai I suggest the spicy tuna roll and the vegas roll, both are decent tasting. This sushi restraunt has nothing special to offer its consumers anymore. If you have been loyal to Kampai you will see how badly a mistake the original owners made when they decided to sell. Also Kampai is now open all the time so you can eat their crappy food almost anytime of the day now.

Herb N' Legend has everything! All their products are good quality and they carry a variety of kratom. One of the best things about this shop is that they are open on sundays until 11pm! I will definitely be going back.

Plaza Bonita definitely surprised me, I had read the reviews here on yelp but even then I had my doubts. Its a very intimate setting, it reminds me of being in Mexico. The staff are very friendly, they call you Amigo which I thought was funny. The staff could be a bit more organized we couldn't find our waiter for a good 15 minutes. Besides all that the food is phenomenal!!! I ordered the Pollo Fundido and Jack got the Steak Fajitas, the food came out steaming hot! We had to wait a few minutes to eat it, it was so hot lol. The Pollo Fundido was creamy, and the chicken perfectly cooked not dry at all, the Steak Fajitas were bomb, the steak wasn't chewy or over spiced, and the tortillas were perfect. Oh and their guacamole is made in house and its beyond tastey. I definitely will be coming back to Plaza Bonita in the near future, be sure to order a side of ranch with the tortilla chips. I know it sounds weird but its super good to dip the chips in. As for their margaritas WOW! Felt like I was back in Rocky Point on the beach! Strong but good and very decent priced. :) Got a nice buzz off of one!

I absolutely love this salon! The first time I went in I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she did the exact design and shape that I wanted. My nails turned out perfect. Prices are perfect, definitely more than reasonable. I will never go to another salon ever again. Try and make an appointment if you can, that way you can for sure get in.
