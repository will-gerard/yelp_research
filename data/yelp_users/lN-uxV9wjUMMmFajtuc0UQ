Contracted Arbor Care to remove a troublesome tree from my backyard, and I was more than impressed.  The team showed up promptly on time, quickly got to work, and were finished very quickly and left my yard very clean and showing no evidence of a tree even existing in the first place.  Their online quote-request was extremely useful as I was able to get an estimate in a matter of hours.

Lunch buffet is medicore at best, def. better food to be had elsewhere.  I usually only go there for the chaat.  However, today we were informed that the restaurant wasn't taking any chaat orders as the kitchen was too busy, all after the waitress had already taken our order.  Meanwhile, one or two other customers were given chaat orders to-go, I'm guessing they called ahead of time.

Called them because their stickers were all over my new home.  Techs came out, told me $250 to replace the wheels, and he'd lube the system for free.  Then after they replaced all the wheels, he asked if i wanted a reinforcing strut installed, and i asked him if he'd do it for free, and he said yes.  Next thing you know, i'm getting charged $360 for all the work, and when i protest, the guy tries to intimidate me by saying he'll go in and rip out the strut if thats what I want.  Complete jerks and ripoff artists, I will NEVER call them again.
