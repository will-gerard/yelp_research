Its a mint to eat here my wife and I used to each here before BC (before children) and its pretty damn wonderful. The wait staff it there for you to wait on YOU. They are excellent, they want you to be happy they want you to have an excellent menu, they want their tip.   It is the old school-old world eats the steak is so tender you can slice it with a fork the lobster my wife had was massive and excellent. And they will shell it for you, you know how hard it is to get at the meat of these things.   The wine is excellent and its a wonderful place to visit if you can take out a low interest loan.   Our bill out the door with tip was $310.00 for two people but that was years ago and I know it has not gotten cheaper.

I had open heart surgery after a cath that showed my heart had a blockage that could not have a stent in it. Everyone here has treated me excellent.

Dr. Fox was suggested to me by my primary care physician because he said that I might have add. I had always considered I had add but just pushed though with coffee to help me focus. But, drinking a pot of coffee is not always the answer and at the age of 39 I took the advice of my doctor of 10 years.  His waiting room is small and has many magazines on the human mind. With the stack of issues there you could with enough time figure out and identify your own disorder thus bypassing the need for your co-pay. I did not have to wait long so I didn't have a chance to dive into the arena of self-diagnosis.  His office staff is very polite with a good sense of humor, as it should be. They do no shake hands in this office, as one of the staff had an organ transplant, and thus wishes not to be sick. While this office rule surprised me if it was my heart I would do the same.   Dr. Fox has been in practice for 20 plus years and it shows. You walk into his office and there is the common couch and chair, he sits by the window. All three times I met with him he did not use any electrical light but chose to use the natural light from outside. The setting is very relaxing and due to the location of the office and building there is very little noise from the other offices. It backs to a huge pond and is well also very relaxing to see this.   He asked me why I had come to see him and answered him with truth. He asked about my early life and family and progressed to current work, life and family. Never once did he seem bored or distracted by the stream of information he was asking for. He is very soft spoken with no air of you're the patient and I'm the doctor. We are just talking and it felt like a conversation. He has a good sense of humor and smiles in agreement with answers or remarks.   The next visit was a 3 1/2 hour test which will or won't be paid for by your insurance the office staff will do the checking for you. This test is taken in the waiting room and takes a long time. It's to see if you have add, hyperactivity or other disorders. My suggestion is bring a snack and a drink if you ask the staff they will give you want out of the cooler. After I was done with my test it was given to the staff and I paid my co-pay and I left.   Two weeks later I received my call and they had the results. I came in reviewed the test sheet agree and they gave me a copy of the results. It was just as I had believed, I had ADD without AADHD and I was a well adjusted person. I was then asked to check to see if they spelled everything correct and the city I was born in was spelled wrong by American standards but spelled correct in Gaelic, I pointed this out and he thought it was amusing. We then discussed the test results and at the end I said, I do not believe there is a reason to see you again.   For people whom need more than 3 sessions to find a solution or their issues consider this, you are paying for the attention of your doctor. You are paying for a trained audience to give you feedback for your personal issues.  You get out of it what you put into it. If I should need to talk to another professional I will return to the care of Dr. Fox I felt he does have the best concerns for his patients.

My cousins were on vacation and so I believed that goldfield would be a good day. The shops are great for children there are no touch me NOT shops and they are kid friendly. The mines are fun for children as is train.  The food is terrible and there is a 20% gratuity tacked on even if the food is bad and the service is terrible. The chicken wings were cold and took 35 mins to come out and people next to us were serviced dinner and we came in 30 mins before them. When I asked why everything took so long she looked at me and said chicken wings take a long time to cook. I used to work in a bar and they take 15 mins so that excuse didn't work for me.   When the dinner came out the food was cold all around and when I asked if we could get warmer food she just walked away.   For 3 kids meals with drinks and two adults came to $91.00.  My advice is to eat before you get there there and don't be slighted this abuse of food and service.   2 Stars is what I give.

The root beer that they make is should be considered CRACK! I go there just for the root beer. Everything in this place is good they have a few floor managers whom walk around asking you if your food is ok. If its not they will take it back and then something else is back to you in 10 mins.   And its right next to a comic book store to boot. Its a good area to go and eat. I would visit again and again.

I want to say this, I've left Phoenix and since moved. The owners of the liberty market wanted me to come back and they would buy me dinner or whatever would make me happy. They didn't do this to buy my review they did it to correct an error. As a owner of past company I respect the effort that they wanted to do this and I'm changing this to 4 stars for the effort alone.   Yes people they do care about their customers.

When a power surge in gilbert took out my LG clothes washer I found myself needing a laundromat which was coined by Westinghouse. (I did not know that.)  1. Its clean in here and smells nice. 2. Free wifi (I'm here now)  3. Met the owner. Heres a really nice guy.  4. Lots of machines and all difference sizes to the amount of clothes you need to wash. I will bring our comforter here as unless you have a uber-huge washer isn't going to do a knock up job.  5. Open 7am to 10 pm every day. Don't know about holidays.  6. Wash and folder service by the pound.$1.10 as of now. 7. There is someone always here on staff, so if you need coins or questions you have service.  8. Its not humid like some of the other places I've been in where the air is so thick with the smell of fabric softer it sticks to your skin. That is not this place.  9. Vending machines chips and snacks and soda.  10. It feels safe here they have closed circuit monitoring, its well lit of you have a full view of gilbert road.  11. Disk network, streaming hi-def TV. You won't miss your game or show if its not already being used.

Going to Houston's either on Scottsdale or on Camelback is like throwing dice. Sometimes its good and sometimes its not at all. Over the years and I have been eating there for years the staff has become less and less polished. I've watched it go from slacks to jeans and very attractive staff to just ok.   It's not cheap to eat there and you expect the food to be consistent but it always isn't. My wife loves the fall vegetable plate but the last two times it was not good the fish that I ordered was very overcooked. I sent it back and the wait staff rolled her eyes.   One other time (years ago) I was waiting with my wife and another couple and we waiting for 30 mins which was normal and person came in with his friends and handed the front person 100.00 it looked like and they were seated right away. I asked the wait girl how much she made a week and she looked shocked that I caught her. She said excuse me walked away I didn't see her for the rest of the night another person seated us 10 mins after that. I wrote a letter to the corp office and never got a letter back.   The real money they make is made off the snowbirds that come in for the winter. So during the winter I would avoid this place.   Good Luck.

Best Breakfast you can get in chandler. Its excellent and its owned by a family. Its a family place and they take special interest in making sure the kids eat well.   My wife and I have eaten here many many times and you need to get there early to so you don't wait, anytime past 9:30 and your looking at a wait. Its not a up to date eats, it looks like something out of the 60's and its charming.   Its right next door to a adult video store but that itself has a bit of humor for the window show and all the morman dads and moms raising eye brows as they would never visit such a place.   Remember people you need to spend money downtown to keep downtown alive.

Cowboy up people, this place is all about the old west. Gun fights in the streets, horse rides, jails for the spouse, its got something for everyone. I told my kids there and they had a ball. My son loved it with his boots and hat and cowboy gun. Its a excellent place to go for the whole family. Yee Haw.

I used to live right down the street from La Casa Blanca and my wife and I used to visit once a week but that was 3 years ago. We moved to Gilbert and didn't visit until tonight. Walking in on a Friday night in the past you had to wait but now none of the tables in the front room had customers only the booths were used and the back room didn't have anything going on.   I read the past reviews and I was stunned because it used to be a 4 star eats. But now I didn't believe it was possible to have food there without flavor and how do you make Mexican food bland? Is it even possible? But yes it is possible but man they did a great job and the wait staff was just blah. They could not care if we were there if we there. They were not rude just not engaged at all.   I'm very sad at what happened to this place. I don't know if it changed owners or management but we won't be returning.   Good Luck out there.

This is the best Mexican food you can get in Chandler considering the they are THE Mexican place to eat in chandler. I've eaten almost everything on the menu and a few times it didn't agree with my taste buds but I'm like that, I'll try anything once even if I don't know what I'll like about it. Your only here once so make sure you try everything.   I've been eating at Serrano's since I made my way to Phoenix way back in 98 both Mesa and Chandler  Chris B, there is a del taco on germann and gilbert that would be better suited to your level of taste but they don't serve beer.   As for the adult video store next door, you could really do yourself a favor and spend some money in there. If, for no other reason than to rub one out and relax, you, really sound like you need to.   Its a great place to eat. Friend or foe I tell the truth.

I have two 6 month old boarder collies and there was two pitbulls that were picking on them and I told the owner to control their dogs after the first fight broke out. They said dogs fight and that its risk that I enter into going into a dog park. These are the type of people that enjoy dog fights and throwing them out of windows on the US 60.   I won't be returing to this place there is no grass the water pond smells terrible. I know the water isn't standing but do they ever drain out the water and replace it? Also the only part that is covered in grass is the small dog area and I have two dogs that love to run so that area is not a consideration.

I wish they served fried chicken but I was told its southern thing. The wait staff is always nice here. I really come here for the pie which they push but don't have to. Anne the waitress is always polite and charming. Also this place won't bust your pocketbook.

I loved it so much I became a member. My kids learned so much being here and it gets you into all the other Carnegie area's in the city and I could not say no. Yes its an investment but I can say to watch the sparks in my kids eyes that they are learning and experiencing meant everything to me.  Your community is what you invest into it. I'm investing into it from all the way from Erie. Yes its a drive but its an all day event that we don't and won't have it in Erie.  The future is where you invest it. Our children and our communities.

If you love beer and I mean really love beer not get drunk but love the taste of beer this is your spot. I am a beer snob and if you ask for a sample they will give it to you without concern they are in the business of quality beer and the food is great too.  I have been lucky enough to be there while a live band played and it was a good equal crowd, what do I mean by this? In Scottsdale its a holier than thou attitude if you drive to downtown chandler there is no attitude. We in chandler know we are not Scottsdale nor do we dream to become.   Downtown Chandler is a better place to have The SanTan Brewing Company. When I move back to PA I will miss this place.

Its about spending money and time where you want to be. I'm really brutal with the places that I visit often and spend money. Try and always spend money at local family eats because if they are a chain they really don't care about you.  When you walk in you get good energy right away. And the UTL was built out with the customer in mind not with the flow of traffic. From where you sit inside you have a complete view of everything. The teas, deserts, kitchen and staff.  None of this, what is happening in the kitchen everything is transparent.   I've tried to eat everything on the Menu even stuff I know I won't like. Everyone is not created equal in the kitchen and the cook proves it. The owner has enough insight to know the kitchen is the cooks domain. As I've been a cook before this is very important to have the peace of mind that I'm in my cooking groove I love to cook and I love this food. When I taste the food that is what I get from the Urban Tea Loft.

San Tan Flat Cowboy up!  My wife and I found this place when we were exploring in queen creek and I thought it looked very interesting. You can if a place has good food by how long its been open, and this place has been open for a long time.   A cowboy theme with firepits for the kids to roast your own marshmellows and S'mores you can purchase a complete kit with long iron sticks Its very family friendly open area. The kitchen as I used to be a cook is near the back and when I looked it looked clean and the staff looked polished. There is straw on the ceiling (yes I'm serious) which my children look at all night. Also cowboy and farm tools are hanging on the way which was very interesting to a 2 and 4 year old.   I ordered the BBQ ribs and the roll and corned cream that came with it was excellent, so good my daughter ate my creamed corn too.  My wife had the lobster tail and steamed vegetables and our kids decided that they were not going eat the chicken fingers we ordered for the because our food was so good.   1. Its loud in there it was a Friday night it was packed and the table are turned over every 45 mins I could count.  2. Yes there are screaming kids running around. If another parent yells at your child what did they do to deserve it. If nothing than have the spine to stand up for your kids even if it is in public.  3. Unsafe environment? Only if your NOT watching your kids,  4. People were getting read to dance which I am a big supporter of. 5. If your food is bad "YOU SEND IT BACK" again this goes back to having a spine. If you are dining with other people this sends them a  message to other people I want what I pay for.  6. The wait staff was johnny on the spot for service and my drink was never at the bottom.   Will I go back sure I will, but it will be when the kids are more rested for the marshmellows.

I stopped at Pita Jungle after I left my heart doctors office and he said you have to eat better your cholesterol is high. So I drove over to Pita Jungle because fuck it one last philly steak and cheese isn't going to kill me. The food there is excellent and the people god-damn rock whom work there. They are always nice and tell me what is good and what has changed or been added to the menu. The pita jungle garlic dip is the thing of dreams and my body loves it.

I found this place purely by chance and it was a jewel of a find. Its tucked away and seems to only be known by the locals. Not very nice to keep a secret like this away from the rest of Phoenix.  The wait staff wanted to know how I liked my meal and is there anything I believe would be better on the meal. They have wine and beer everything on the menu is healthy and did not taste processed or rushed. This place is also kid friendly inside and on the menu.  They try to use local produce and cook seasonly but I'll never know because I've moved from Phoenix. This is a great place owned and run by great cooks and owners.

Bring your fly swatter because the manager from Chicago said I'm sorry we can't do anything about it because its a open bar to the outside. I understand this but I could see them inside of the kitchen because we were seated against the glass. When I looked into the kitchen the cooks were just standing out talking to the management. It was not busy when we were there so the either they are of the religion of Hinduism that all life is sacred, to be loved and revered, and therefore practice ahimsa, noninjury, in thought, word and deed or it just isn't important. I don't know and I didn't ask so I can't say either way.  The waiter brought out chopsticks trying to be funny as to bring the idea of the Kesuke Miyagi from the movie the Karate Kid from 1984. I didn't find it funny as the flies were diving upon my wife and I during our lunch.   Enough about the files which are gross lets talk about the food. Our food was just ok, we started the baked spinach artichoke dip, mozzarella, parmesan, tortilla chips $10.50 which was soupy and not thick like I remember it was not hot but just warm. Like I said it was ok, not worth the $10.50 more like $7.50.  I had the macadamia nut chicken house mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables, shoyu cream, pineapple-papaya marmalade $14.25 and it was just a bit on the warm side of cold. I asked for a extra bit of pineapple-papaya marmalade because what they put on the plate was a dot the side of a quarter (I guess this is more expensive than printer ink due to how rare pineapple is). Again my food was warm and not hot. Being a past cook I would have given it some radar love and made sure it was hot going to the customers. Or at the least put it under the heat lamps so it didn't lose the existing heat. In the end they didn't try...  My wife had the fish taco's for $11.00 and it looked like a good amount of food. You get two of them for the price.   My wife had the ice tea and I had a beer our total for the lunch was $46.08 and feel it should have been $10.00 cheaper as we acted at pest control.   4/22/2014 Earth day 1:30 PM

When my family visited Hong Kong Kitchen II the first thing I noticed is that the family dining area can be moved around to host a large group of people. Its also very clean while we were there for the 1 1/2 we noticed constant cleaning. The bathrooms are also spotless and smell nice.   The Food: (Hunan, Mandarin Hong Kong Style)  No M.S.G All the food that we ordered tasted fresh and was full of flavor. During our meal the wait staff stopped by often and paid attention to see if we were looking at them in a way that says, please come here I need something. Often Chinese food tastes over salted but this was not the case. My wife had the sweet and sour chicken because our children 2 and 4 could dip it into the sauce, it was not over done and the vegetables were also fresh and high quality.  I ordered the wonton soup and I have noticed that not every place makes it the same. The wonton's were solid and tasted good but the  chicken broth of the soup was weak and lacked other meat such as shrimp or pieces of chicken. The best wonton soup in the city is hosted at "PF Changs" which has pieces of pork and shrimp.    I had the chicken Lo-Mein and I always expect the slightly greasy noodles but they didn't taste that way or like paste. The amount of chicken in the lo-mein plenty and I felt it was a good meal  This is a family business (I asked) and they seem to have a good flow of position and were polite in teaching my children a work in Chinese. I will always visit a family business over a standard eats in your all to common strip mall.   I will visit this place over and over again as I would like to try everything on the menu.

I remember when this was a landfill and I used to live down the street from it and wondered if it would keep growing like Mt trashmore in Va Beach where I have skate boarded at in my younger years. The city of chandler plans everything out and I believe the city planner might have serious illness of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder because the park is very well planned out.   There are tube slides to keep your kids from having the skin pulled off by the hot desert heat. I didn't know that slides can get to 160/180F until I saw a parent with a heat gun reader at one park in Mesa. I was shocked and told myself I would never let my kids get burned. There is a geo-spider web dome that the children can climb to the top. Its not easy to get to the top which slows them down going up and coming down.   There is golf Frisbee which I didn't know it existed until I watch a group of people play. You need patience and very good aim to play this game but it looks to be popular.   Do you have a young girl in the house that loves the hunger games and believes archery is an art form? You in luck because the other side of the park is the nicest archery range I've ever seen. The amount of land they set aside for this area was wise and I'm sure it was a much better idea than a shooting range.   Cross training track covers the whole of the park and its not easy when you're a dad in your 40s and very challenging. The vista is a great place to sit down relax and take in the whole of chandler and it might be the highest point that isn't in a building.   Bathrooms are clean and are cleaned every single day which makes taking kids there much easier. Also I noticed there is always someone from the city there either taking tests or cleaning or checking out the park. Many times I've noticed a chandler K9 police units there to give their dogs some downtime from riding in a car all day.   The dog parks are the cleanest dog parks I've never seen. I say parks because there are two of that are rotated so one dog park does not become a overrun wasteland like Cosmo park in Gilbert. They are covered in grass and there are places for the dogs to get water and for people to sit. I found the best times are early morning at 8AM and 6PM for all the dogs to meet and greet. What makes Paseo dog park different is that I've not had an issue violent dogs or violent dog owners. These people whom believe its ok to take their ill-tempered dogs to the park and then they pick on other dogs for the sport of it and the owners think its no big deal.   So pack some treats and water make the trip here. Its free and great place to burn off a few hours.    Good Luck, Jason

Runny eggs and when I sent them back they were still runny eggs. The t-bone steak was 70% fat and I showed the waitress and she didn't care at all. It was the worst cut of meat I've ever had. If you HAVE to eat there get the ham steak you will always get a good cut that way. The coffee was cold and I had to asked for more then one creamer and she brought back a cup with on creamer in it. This screams of management cutting back on everything or the wait staff just hate the customers. Perhaps its a little of both I don't know.   Never again will I go into a Dennys.

The customer service here is terrible. I went here on April 1st and I really planned to buy three pairs of shoes but being an old man (43) I was not important and I even said I'd like to buy some new shoes and after looking for 30 mins at all the shoes I walked out. And the the counter clerks said thank you for coming. Jesus? How do the owners expect to make any money with these people manning the counter? With each of the pair of shoes at $60 that would have been $180.00 and they must get commission.   Here is the biggest kicker, we, my wife and I were the only people in the store as it was the middle of the afternoon.   I won't be spending my money here again because there are a ton of other stores that want my business in the mall area. You have been informed...

Its crack chicken, its really really good and you want another sandwich as soon as your done with yours. There is a play area where the kids can go and you can actually talk to your wife or husband. Just make sure the kids wear socks as it gets kinda dirty in there. I know they clean it, but its a high traffic area and it gets dirty.

Every time I visit famous Dave's I try and get something different and I'm not disappointed. You will not leave this place not full even the more smaller plates are stacked high.   When place opened my wife and I were walking by with our kids and it was the pre-opening. It was VIP day and the manager asked if we were hungry and to come on it, the food is free today.    I've been back about 4 other times since February and the manager comes by to talk because I used to be a cook and in the food service. All the side dishes are really great, my daughter decided that the corn bread on her plate was not enough. She helped herself to my plate finished my cornbread too and then moved onto the rib tips. 20 mins after that she was asleep in the chair and slept all the way home and throughout the night.   The beer selection could be better, I'd like to see some more micro-brews but I feel this way from drinking beer at San Tan Brew in chandler.

Its Olive Garden its not very special and the food tastes processed. The waiter was very nice and gave crayons to my kids. She got a bonus tip for that. Its a wide selection and it changes as its a national chain and they have new specials all the time.   Its a good bet you will get a good meal there and leave full.

My wife said we are going to see a movie and you can get lunch while you watch the movie. Sure, great our son wanted to see planes and its been a while since I saw movie with my son.   I ordered the coconut chicken tinders and they were terrible. I used to work in the kitchen and you can taste when the deep fryer oil has not been changed out and what happens is everything then tastes the same. It was overcooked, the sweet potato fries were soggy and my drink was watered down. Walls are thin and you can hear the other movie room next to yours and it ruins the experience. My son sat in the middle and didn't notice but his mac and cheese came out and it was super salty. He tasted it and said Daddy this does not taste right. I tasted it and called the staff over only to be told, if we get him something else he will only come out 10 mins before the movie starts. I stopped being charming at that point and gave them a new order and that order came out cold and didn't mix well with the Ice cream my wife ordered for them.   The seats are stiff and you can't really get comfortable in them and the other seats are office chairs with long desks in front of them where they pay a little less but I'm guessing the food still sucks.   There is 1 bathroom for the guy and 1 for the gals. In the guys room there are three stand up urinals and 1 stall. Whoever designed this place had no concept of math at all. For the girls room the line went out door and curved around. My daughter almost didn't make it but a few women said go ahead of us.   1. Bad food 2. Bad service 3. Bad bathrooms 4. Bad seats.   Not a bad movie for a 6 year old child. My son really liked it.

My son loves eggs everything about them how to prepare how to whip them hard boiled. I took him here before we have a day together of talking and walking to the comic book store, train store and he said Dad those eggs were good. They were sunny side up not burned not slimly and they made the smile face with the bacon and toast were ears. I like little touches like that seem like a gimmick but to a little boy without a high chair it's a big smile and it takes such little effort for the cook (I used to be a cook) or the server to make a plate look good.

Kneaders can make really good bread and deserts but the soups but sandwiches and soups are not that great. I had a chicken salad sandwich and it was so boring. It was served on a croissant and it had tiny pieces of chicken and celery mayo too. I had the wedding soup and it was just blah. I could tell it was a serious pre-mix. My two kids had the chicken noodle soup and the noodles are bigger than Paradise Bakery but it has little flavor. Its just boring and it sucks that its boring.

Its ok food, I know its a local family business but the wait for the food was almost and hour and I think they lost the order or forgot because when I told the manager that people have been seated and ate and then left he was not happy. Also I'm an old cook so I know how long it takes and oh my server was no where to be found he just disappeared. I won't go back back because the food is just ok its nothing great. I've had frozen pizza that was better.
