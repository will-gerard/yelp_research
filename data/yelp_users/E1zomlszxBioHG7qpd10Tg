Haven't seen the show yet but Darnita from the staff is awesome at the box office. She is full of good tips and made sure we got good seats with our voucher. Just super friendly

The gilleys girls are great and overall the bartenders are amazing. This review is for Wednesday night karaoke. The DJ is an awful nazi for everyone but himself. He doesn't consider lynrd skrnrd, the band or Bonnie Rait to be country karaoke. Meanwhile he let Robin Thicke and Jay-Z pass as acceptable song choices. He is all about himself doing songs instead of people from the bar. I only gave one extra star for the service before 10. He freaking allowed his wife to sing rap instead of country that people wanted to dance to. He had no sense of what the crowd wanted. I won't go back for karaoke that's for sure.

I don't know who is more awesome, the bartenders, the live band or the Canadians fucking with each other at the next table... But I love this bar.

I absolutely loved this place. This is a really good place to bring out of towners because the vibe is cool and the food is good. It was a little cold because the doors don't really close (skip this place in the dead of winter). The fried zuchinni is excellent and the fontina burger is highlighted on the menu for good reason, but honorable mention goes to the grilled cheese.

I have seen both Dr. Fowler and Dr. Enos now so I can confidently review the practice as a whole. They are great! It had been a while since I had seen a dentist and they stay true to their word about educating you instead of lecturing you. Even more importantly their staff of hygienists are FAST! I've never had a cleaning be that quick and thorough before. Overall I would totally recommend to a friend.

The food was so delicious! I didn't really know what a lot of it was but I enjoyed every bite. If you don't eat tapas a lot I'd Google some of this in advance so you know what to expect but it was all really good. We got four small plates which was awesome for two people. Very filling but not too much food. It was all kind of rich as well so don't go in expecting many low calorie options. The service was great and the flamenco was really cool for the atmosphere.

This place is really good for a date. Cocktails were very strong which I like! You have to try the cheetah roll. I'm not a sushi purist so in love the experimentation! Actually okay to go on weekends too because it isn't bursting at the seams with people. We sat at the sushi bar the first time and a table the second time and the service was good. Definitely coming back.

The bull roll was like whaaaaaaaatttt amazing. The service was incredible as well and everything was very clean and precise... Exactly how Japanese food should be. This was a great spot for a quiet date and it was quiet on the weekdays so might be good for meetings as well. It looks a little weird from the outside but the inside is nice.

I love this  place. I get take out here all the time. The service is really good and the food is obviously good too. They have spicy levels 1 through 5 and for once I actually think that they are pretty accurate for how spicy the food actually turns out. They'll also do steam tofu but you have to ask for it. Overall I would recommend it it's good for a date night.

Really good. They had a live band when we went on Saturday. The salmon cakes were delicious and the bottom burger has a really good bun.

Jay I'd awesome to work with. His consultation for my pool was quick and his fee is reasonable. He is never late and I always think he does a great job cleaning and getting everything perfect so I can just enjoy my pool. I also really appreciate that he has automatic billing so I don't have to think about that either. The girl in the office (forgot her name) is also excellent at emailing and communication. She was really nice when my card expired and it was time to update all my info. I would recommend them for sure.

This place is misleading advertising. They don't have their own food menu. The menu is from Crust upstairs and if you haven't had the misfortune to eat the microwaved food you can spare yourself. The ostrich tops off this mushy microwaved misadventure with an added dash of being too dark and musty for this 26 year old. Skip it.

Shelby is a really responsive agent. Some agents say they are available at any time, but she really means it and her team has really good cooperation.   I was really impressed with her knowledge of the Phoenix and Glendale areas, which is good because I wasn't sure where I wanted to buy. She has a good approach for making sure you think about all the parts of the transaction, including things like having good resale value and knowing what paperwork you need. I would use her again.

This place is not ready for prime time. First of all, they don't have their full menu up on the main wall, they have the sandwich menu on printer paper which I almost missed. I got the SW salad and it was drastically overpriced. It had a few beans, a bit of corn and some tofu (the tofu was the highlight of the salad and there was not nearly enough) and barely any dressing. The quality of the lettuce was inferior. There is no way this should be an $8 salad... I can get a much better one from Paradise. I won't be coming back.
