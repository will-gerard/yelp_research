Love the place-food was okay. I had a great visit here. The place has a lot of unique antique items. Worth the visit if you love old items. They even serve the old pops. The thi g about it is I was thinking the food would be as good as the atmosphere. Well no. The food was okay food but not something that I would say I am thinking of getting any anytime soon.   The server was nice but took sometime for us to be served.  Would not comeback. I was really looking forward about this place..

Been using this more than usual lately. It quiet good in regards to airports around the US. and better than any airports outside US! Its just those who are not familiar to the exits or the round about upon exiting might get lost, I suggest following the signs and slow down.

This place is what I call hidden gem. Like the kind of gem where you need to dig miles and miles below the earth core before you find this shiny gem. The place is on a very remote area of phoenix. Not only is this very hard to fins- there is basically nothing next to it, its also very hidden, only able to find because of yelp. I was shocked when we found this place cause it looks like they have a ton of patrons and the flow of orders are none stop. The last time we went( yes I have visited multiple times) I have tried several foods that they offer and to tell you that each one of those food did left my taste buds very satisfied is a understatement.  Try it. And keep tell your friends to try it too. So that this gem can be discovered by others. Its a shame that a lot don't know this place.  :)

If barnes and nobles has less expensive toys than your store, you have a problem.   Huge store- spent 1 hour trying to find some stuff to buy. Just to come out empty handed. I went to find stuff for some gifts, of all the categories I checked was way too expensive than other stores.  1. They have limited pop funko on the store ( only 12) - which were also was more expensive than amazon, barnes nobles and target.   2. Lego - they have alot, but again they are way too expensive. Believe me I spend 30 minutes looking for some kind of decent (fair) price. None. Even the Lego store at arrowhead has cheaper price.  3. Minions- the minion part is the most ridiculous part of this store. Not only are they too expensive for their quality, they are just plain stealing the money out of your pocket- my gf said that the quality of the minions are so bad that she can't believe such stuff are being sold on a store like this.  I used to love toys r us but it seems they are failing year by year to come out with the right strategy to make me come back to buy anything.

Don't buy the sushi here. That's all, you'll thank me later. I bought the arizona and the Las vegas roll. 6 pieces each - for 18.50?. The flavor is bland. The portion and size is the smallest of sushi I have ever eaten.   There's no eel sauce on their sauces on the side.   Literally 18 dollars for 12 pieces of sushi? I will never come back here.   Had to drive through McDonald's to satisfy our stomach. Can't believe I went here for a sushi. Probably the worst sushi I ever tasted, as the other person with me said "frys cold sushi is better than this".  Please stay away if you want sushi...

Wahhhhhhhhh!!!! I found the da vang near Laveen! OKAY before you bash my review, that was a compliment!!!  Every pho places I have been to, are lower standards than DA VANG superior food flavor. Let me say that this place surpasses that and it's has that da vang flavor too in some of their food:)  This just became my number 1 pho place!!!

I appreciate great food when I find one. And this my fellow yelpers is hidden gem near Laveen. Read ahead for fora full review.  Short review- the area can be intimidating at first, but believe me the flavor is amazing, worth the trip. They have traditional American breakfast food but runs specials on the weekends. I tried their hearty breakfast w/c comes in different meat along with hash and toast. Their flavor is just outstanding, the patty melted with the hashbrown and with an egg on the side- it was just heaven. Portions are huge and price is cheap. If my pictures does not convince you to try it out- I hope this review does.  Detailed and long review. Came here on a Saturday with gf. Got a hard time finding the place and that was using Google map, when they say it's "tucked in" they really mean it's tucked and hidden. The place caters to the surrounding  area and have alot of patrons. What they lack my friendly yelpers are elites coming and representing the area! They have been here for years!Back with the food- Their patty is very juicy and the egg benedict is just out of this world with their flavor.   I hope the pictures will convince more yelpers to come over and check it out.

This is my to go when it comes to Vietnamese food. Its cheap, flavor is awesome and they have consistency. This was also my first place to go with pho. Its been years since my first taste and every time I go eat Vietnamese food my taste buds always compares it to Davang. That says a lot. The only caveat I have for the place is that sometimes they don't have a lot of the foodsin the menu- like their curry. Also the place could really benefit on a make over- been to places like little miss Saigon that has the atmosphere and decorations on top of their delicious food. But other than that its all good.  If its your first time- get the BBQ bun. Its very delicious and very cheap then grab a pho - number 1.

One food will make you wow= mashed potato.  If you find any place that have better mashed potato than this place let me know:) But for now this is the best place to get mashed potato.  There turkey is like heaven!!! On top of the juicy flavored meat, its topped with gravy. The chicken here also ruins alot of the chicken i have tasted for a long time. :)   Cozy place. Something that whole family can just chill and relax.  Okay but theres more!! Not only the food are tasty, they are also HUGE! Their sandwich can feed 2 persom their pies (ONE slice) can feed 3 person, no joke.   I cant believe after taking home 3 boxes full of home made bread, half of each our orders we only paid 30 @_@ with a freaking tip!! Woaaaaahhhh!!!  If you dont believe me, go try it. Then you can thank me for making you believe.

Since I came to phx this place has been my family's choice of dimsum but recently flavor have become a bit stale maybe because we might too much there now that the flavor seems to bit  "missing" something. The only thing we get now is the BBQ bun and even that one is fading. Maybe just our taste buds but pls try it out. They really had us for more than 4 yrs. Might need to stay away for awhile and then come back after few months.   :) still like there dimsum. A bit pricey but its the only dim sum I know near phx area.  Update: the flavor is degrading a bit. Their usual spicy pork chop just got erased from our to go. It's so salty now.   Also this came to my mind the pink slip. I think it would be nice if they put a English version of that paper that they come and check every time you order something. Wouldn't that be nice?

One of the best pho i ever tasted. The place is a bit far from my place and hard to find- but the drive is all worth it. Mught also want to call them before thinkinh og deiving there- cause one time we drove all the way and yelp says they were open but the time we got there it was close. Try their pho its really good. I recommend the pho and their rolls.   The pho they make has more aroma and flavor than most vietnamese places i have been. If youre in the area and wants to try something i would suggest this place. The only thing against this place is- their a bit more expensive than the other vietnamese places i have been to!

One if the best mouth watering pizza I have ever tasted. In days after my first visit, I am already back for more. You don't even need to read my review to see how good this place is. There are tons of people raving this place. The only stuff I can add is this  "NO MATTER WHAT YOU ORDER, YOU NEED TO TRY THE SPAGHETTI CALZONE"  If that does not blow your mind then I don't what would. Another tip, the other spinatos places seems to have lower stars. I don't know why but I have not even dare to try them. I live like 11 miles on other spinatos  and this is like 16 miles away. We choose this.

My sister in law swear to god this place kills all pilipino food around vegas. She has been here for alot of times now and this is first time coming in here. We already ordered when i found the news hee in yelp. :( it my fault i guess that i didnt check yelp before, I usually believe her when it comes to food. But this recent nrws really knock my appetite to the food. Yet Iam here to tell you that I didnt rate them because of the recent news (roach infestation.) Rather iam writing this rating with the same criteria I have been giving other food places.  We ordered: Chopsuey Pancit bihon  And family set( includes ; bbq pork and chicken, squid, and arellanong bangus. Rice  Lets start with the chop suey. The vegetables were fresh and the flavor is there when it comes to the chop suey taste that filipino style shouls be but the chicken that came with the chop suey was dried up. So dry that we didnt touch it. Next the pancit, it was probably the one thing that i ate alot of on the bunch, it taste good, and has all the flavor i want frpm a pancit. Lastly the big family plate which contains different food, the beef bbq is probably the only thing that was near the taste that is near the standard of pinoy beef bbq. The chicken bbq was we only took 1 bite out of it, 4 sticks remained on the platter. The arellanong bangus was okay, but it tasted not fresh, as well as the squid, which i may add has only the bbq sauce on top of it, and smoked. I would have done better prepartion on it, no to mention , it tasted days old or refrigerated.  Regardless of the ROACH infestation which we saw momenta before we eat, i find this place pricey with foods that are not as highly as other yelpers say. Maybe my standards of pinoy foods are high, but when a chicken bbq is so messed up that the bbq chicken that I make home made is way better than what you sell, then theres a problem.   Lastly I would not reccomend anyone to eat here. I dont know if its true but they should have the GRADE C on their door, I may be wrong but its either they have never put it out, or they have been inspected again since January i cant find an update about the roach infestation.  This will be the last time i will eat here, i took a chance to see if the flavor and taste are what the other yelpers said are true, even in the midst of knowing what might be back on that kitchen. Yelpers take this advice, and stay away, not unless you want be another brave sould to try out their kitchens delicacies.

I will be a honest i used to a believer and used to come here often. Yet recent visits seems to make me feel that this place has lost its touch.  4 reasons: (each points is a star minus.)  1. I am a spam masubi guy and I probably have gone to most of the places that serves them in the valley. This place was my go to before until i start tasting others. Today I ordered 2 more for old time sake and i cant believe that this was the same spam masubi I tasted before. First theres so much rice, so much that you cant even taste the spam. Theres so little sauce. I even told the guy for extra sauce and checked my order and theres still so little sauce. As a guy who loves spam masubi, i had my share of experience on making them, and if my spam masubi is better than the one you can buy in any place, then that place needs some changes. You go out to eat a better food that is not in your house- thats the essence of eating out.  2. Their soup has no flavor. No joke. Try it. I dare you.  3. If youre vegeterian or feeling dieting for a day please dont buy their healthy salmon. The fish has no flavor at all. Almost made me puke:(.  4. Lastly it seems they stop listening to customers. When I we used to eat here all our request were fulfilled. If you ask more sauce on your food you get initially. If you ask for put the lettuce on the side cuase maybe your allergic they do it. If ask for extra gravy you get them in the side. Yet now all our request seems to be neglected. As my friend said, it feels like they are slimming their food. Maybe to get more profit?  Anyways, the experience is no longer there and the taste is basically gone. Maybe those who havent tried other places might find them really good. But to those who have tasted others I request you to try it once. If you like it disregard my review. For me this is the last time I am driving 45 minutes for their food (yeah i was dedicated).  P.S  One star for the nostalgic part of it. Also yelp wont allow 0 star.

Been coming here for 5 yrs. Nothing beats their chicken lo mein. Then don't even think about the price for less than 30 dollars u can have lunch for 4 to 5 people!!! Some says that their flavor has decreased? --pls tell it to the owner or the chef, it will help with patrons like us, or new comers. I had one time asked them to add more teriyaki sauce for my order and spice which they did. From now on when I order that item they know to put extra flavoring.  Sometimes our taste buds get used to flavors  and need a little more to get that same flavor were so used to. it's scientifically proven that the more we eat the same thing the brain we crave more of that flavor, :)

Best place here in baseline for: Running Walking Bbq Fishing Biking Skating Reviewing Or just chillin  The place has a library near it. Grab a nice book and read it in the park overlooking the lake where ducks are floating all over it. Theres plenty of shades,  places for kids to play, alot of spot to fish, a huge parking spot. Theres nothing more to add. This place is one of the scenic park here in phx. Hands down:)   P.S  When you go walking bring something to drink the whole place is almost 2 miles. It also have a island where it goes full circle. Other than that come and enjoy this great park!

The worst customer service ever, if ur looking for blinds this is not the place to go, rebecca and myra are kind only to the point where u buy ur item then when their done and yoi get defective items they will ignore you, we waited 20 days for them to fix our blinds and after all the hassles they wouldnt do it!!! So yes please dont go here, worst service ever!

Update: just came here for the 100th time to fix our blinds. This place don't have their act together. Evwrytime I come to visit it takes no less than 2 hours for them to fix something that need to be fix. Even if you call them ahead and make arrangements nothing is faster than 2 hours. Iam sitting here right now waiting to be help.   So the lady that supposed to help me in the customer service - Miss Wendy. Not only told me they can't be helped here and I have to do it on my own. Well good thing I called their Manager before hand and asked him "where, what, how do I fix this?" He said "Go to customer service they should be able to help you". Good Lord it's been 2 hours and 30 minutes and I am not finished here yet. I went for a emission testing and I was there faster than it.  Oh btw the way I end up talking to the other with a person whose supposed to help me. This is ridiculous.  -______- already thinking of pulling everything off and going to lowes. I don't want to curse but this place is a waste of my time.

For an easy and quick review read this part. Pros: 1. Place has the atmosphere. Great place to drink I bet. 2. Very clean place. 3. They run some lunch specials. 4. They give 15 percent off. 60 days expiration  Cons: 1. If you're not familiar with Korean flavor stay away  2. Most of the food we ordered is lacking something, there is just that missing flavor. 3. Pricey- I think this should be between 3 to 4 price.  4. A bit rude customer service and slow at the same time. (More on the review)  If you want some detailed review keep reading. I came here long time ago but wasn't using yelp by then. We had a bad experience " a small friendly critter was on one of our food." I was a bit skeptical to come back here but let me put it this way, that previous incident did NOT in anyway affected my review. I was even open on trying everything. And when I say Everything I meant everything, even the sides that most of my colleagues didn't want to touch.  LET me try to do my best to individually give feedback on the food we ate. First the their most tipped food the bulgogi, it was too sweet for me. Just little onion and other than the sweet flavor I didn't tasted any other flavor, however my colleagues stated that I should had tried the pork bulgogi. Teriyaki chicken was lacking in flavor too, even though the meats were soaked with so much sauce. Chicken katsu was so bland, if you have tried any decent hawaiin place that has chicken Katsu, you will understand what i mean. Fried chicken that looks and feels like from Church's , crunchy but covered TOO much with flour. They also have sushi. We tried the Vegas roll  and the tempura. The tempura tasted good. I think that's the only reason why I liked the place, thus the one star. The vegas roll however did not do good on my taste buds. So little flavor. Lastly I also tried the different sides, the only thing that was okay was the cabbage.  So that's for the food's review.  Continue to read for miscellaneous part of the review. The service was quiet odd because the guy who was helping us was a bit slow. He also wanted to make sure WE knew that it was a Korean place when we asked for condiments that they did not have. The price also was a bit on the high price, felt like we dine on Scottsdale when there was only 5 of us and we paid on the high hundreds.   The only thing I could add is that they have a good atmosphere.

Okay! This needs an update. I knew it was too good to be true. Well I came and got another order from this location. And was so surprise to what the new employee did " he weighed all my food" then took some away? Like what?!?!   I didn't sat anything to be respectful but to weigh food in front of you and be taken away is just ridiculous. I probably ate atleast twice a month here especially for easy Asian cravings. Until they fix this I won't be going to this place anymore. I would rather go somewhere else.  P.S the new guys name is Jonathan. Yeap. Sorry. That's just not appropriate. Would u want me to serve you then take just a piece of that food cause it more than what the weigh says?  Ughhh.

Iam used harkins for 4 yrs. And have been a Amc stub member for 2 yrs. We rarely use other movie house since I started being a stub member @ harkins. Today that will change! This place is awesome. A dollar cheaper on both AmC and harkins. A lot of parking spot even for a Saturday! Also they have the same as arrowhead AMC chairs- recliner.  Pros:  Alot of parking spot. Cheaper than AmC Reclining chairs Less crowd They always play international movies!  Cons: Food is meh. Finding it was a bit hard even with Google maps.   Overall this beats both harkins and AMC!

Best filipino food i ever tasted. Settle with the basic and youll be fine like the adobo, the fried fish. There's some room for improvement for some of their food like the pancit, the pinakbet, but with the right seasoning I think they can make them better. There's a ton of sweet stuff to look for here, they have a small part of the restaurant that shows all the great pinoy sweets. I suggest taking anything with taro, or ube. They are so good.   Their a bit on mid range when it comes to price but I think its worth it. The people here are so nice too!

Never tried their food. Might be really good but read along for the 1star review.  Came here after a long walk on the strip. We called in and asked what time they close. Also checked yelp for good measure. Then when we walked in, the employees were literally closing the place. Few food was still outside but they were scrubbing soap and cleaners on the counter.  As soon as I said "hi". The other lady said "just take out now". And I was shocked, we still have 45 minutes to eat right? Wrong. And other of the employees said " you can eat outside if you want". WHAT? They want us to eat outside when it's literally 40 degrees outside. There are snows in the mountain tops of the nearest mountains in vegas!! And lastly just to put the experience over the top. The other lady jokingly said " unless you will pay us overtime sir?"... yeap. That just happened.  For a Filipino place that caters for our culture they have negative way of trying to make you "feel at home". This place might have good food. But they get zero manners. Not a way to represent the Filipino culture.   Hope no one ever experience the same thing. And I hope the owner checks the attitude of his workers. If If I own a business, I won't kick people out that way. I will make sure never to come back to this place, and make sure the people I know don't check this out either.

Family loves to come here for brunch. I used to really love this place. I highly recommended it first when I had my first bite but as time goes the flavor and its "wow " factor is gone. Now its just an average restaurant, family still comes here once in awhile catching a brunch or a dinner. Their a high on price, but I think with the selection of food its expected.  I would like to state that the servers are great here. But sometimes when youre caught between breakfast and lunch they just take out the breakfast portion out of the way, sometimes just while iam waiting on the line to get a waffle or something on the breakfast menu, and there is no way to get it back on the selections of food.

Nothing can beat this place. Heres quick 5 points to why it stands with all the pho places in the valley.  1. Consistent flavor. Some places misses their flavor especially when packed but not this 0lace.  2. Customer service is top notch from the moment you walked in to the time you leave.  3. Reasonable price. The price is not as high as those pho places that around the valley. The portions are good too.  4. Clean. Yeap simple as that.  5. Atmosphere is good.  Other thought: i wish their open 7 days.

The first and last time i went to this place they gave us cold food. I was so excited to try this- by the time i went here they still had 4 stars. Now writing this revirw its down to 3. Makes sense to me. Heres the thing i found not quiet good abiut the place.  Cons: 1. Cold food. 2. No flavor. 3. Expensive. 4. Very rude server 5. The cake- is very bland- too dry- like dry as a bread. 6. Vegestable not fresh  Just avoid the place. We went to another restaruant that day to finish the day.

When we came here, i was given the impression that the food was good. There was also a bunch of people in the door waiting so i got pump. When we got to our food though, i was so disappointed. The food is mediocre and my aunts cooking is way better. Their food are oily. No joke, no offence but take a bite and you will using those wipes alot because the oil are gonna stick at your lips. Now the good things, the steak was huge, the biscuit was big, and pancakes are large enough for 2 people. Also the bacon is good and thick. If I was given a chance i would pick another breakfast place. There was so little flavor to my order (steak breakfast) that i had to use so much seasoning, tabasco, ketchup, pepper, and salt.   This is only my review i lf you want to really try please do so. :)

I love books. I literally would spend hours just browsing at them. And this place is by far one of the biggest barnes and noble place I have seen :). The place has its own place for food! Not only they have books, food, they also have toys and alot more for the young at heart and even for the hobbyist in all of us!  Just a quick tip : join the membership if you plan to buy alot of stuff, it will get you 10 pct off your purchase! That's basically your tax on each item!!!  What I would like to see though is more tables or places to just chill- but I guess that would be asking too much since people like me would never -ever leave the place and just read their books for hours!!!!!  So what are you waiting for?! If you see me here yelpers- don't be shy to say hi! :)

The last time I went to eat their pho I was not impressed. Maybe because I had so much of 43rd express and phone avihna- or davang cafe. Those 3 has better flavor and better portion. I think they have the same price range. But I have to actually put some spices on my pho to get something out of the food. I think they get a lot of people because it s convenient on those who just visited the market place.   If you thinking of phone I can't recommend this place. Its very forgettable.

I love this frys! Not only its near my house they also run alot of sales. I get the newspaper but they also send me exclusives deal! We usually buy most of our itmes on this store then used our points at the end of the month on their gas. Double whamey!!! The only reason i took 1 star is that they decided to remove the spot where they sell nuts and chocolate covered items, like the one @ sprouts!  Other than the change iam very hapoy that i live near this place!!

First review in almost 5 months. used to go here alot. I even know the faces of the serves and I know them by name. The thing about this place after not coming here for so many months is that they had a hug renovation. Gone are the old decor and the old tables and chairs. The new style and atmosphere is 10 times better than the old one but to my dismay the food went from 4 star to 2 almost 1 star. Here's the 4 main reason I put it to 2 star.  1. My favorite pot roast was smothered by gravy. it's covered with gravy I can't even see anything in my plate just dark brown gravy.  2. Foods are too salty. This was not an issue before, yes maybe their leaning more in the salty side but not this salty. I could swear to god my bread was as salty as my gravy.  3. So after my dismay I told myself maybe it's just one of those day, u know. But even in the dessert department they got me upset. First ordered a milkshake. Maybe it's just me but it doesn't taste like it used to. It doesn't have that smoothness and it's too chocolatey. Almost like someone just poured a bucket of chocolate powder in a bucket and shared it. Oh and they forgot to ask if I want whipped or not and put whipped on it-_-  4. Okay after that I tasted their used to be pancake. And said of course they can't mess this up. Well, the pancake is so stale and was not smooth at all. You know that feeling of like eating a either cold or old food. That's what I felt when I started eating that pancake.  P.s I will still give it another try.

I have tried this place for several times now. I just didn't had time to make a review by then. Anyways I truly loved their buttermilk trade mark pie. I would say it's one of the best buttermilk pie in the valley.   Now that's out of the way let's speak of the overall experience. If it's your first time coming in here I totally suggest trying their- small portions they put out to try their new stuff or just ask them if you want to taste their food. Most of the bad reviews here are based on bad experience because they see a 5 star review and thinks everything is good here. Just like other places though there are different taste on each stuff they sell. I for one thinks some are too sweet and some are too flavored. But in their fairness most of the items they sell are  better than others.  The atmosphere is very inviting- I suggest you cherish it and just don't order pick up. We usually just take 15-20 to just stay for awhile:)  Other than guys I thinks it's nice that this place exist. It's unique- other than address so hidden the place is awesome- go try it out!

I went here to get my maltipoo  be taken care off. I should have learned from a previous experience on the same company @ a different location. When we came in i wanted to get her a groom and some toys. I was shocked when she got her haircut. It was not even close to what i call good looking. We do grooming with some of our own equipments with hwr but wanted to give her the special treatment. It didnt end up well. We went home feeling a bit discouraged to use their grooming place:(

Wow finally a place to put my rant!! This place cant be more unproffesional!! I had my fillings done in this place and swear to God i will never ever ever go back...okay let me first tell you the trouble i been to, first i went and got a cleaning plus fillings then the doctor recommended a root canal i said i would do that after the fact i go back home to my country, all i wanted was to get a filling and kill the pulp or whatever they term that, oh my mom is a dentist but shes not here, so i know what i was aking the dentist to do. After few visits i Had to forcefully ask the dentist not to ask me more about root canal and other stuff, and by the way they charge u 25 dollars for miss scheduled visits even though they schedule u 3 months in advance and dont give u a call to say that its your turn the next day. Anyways when i got all my fillings and cleaning done... I paid more than i should have i mean, i asked my insurance and they said why u paid for "toothpaste, toothbrush, dentist fee, rescheduling fee" this are all not supposed to be paid on ur wallet. To cut the story short the place keeps sendin me mail saying i owe them money when my insurance said they already claimed and talk to them!! For god sake this place is a rip off!!! Just let me know when u meet the lady who accepts phone call, do assist the dentist, clean the garbage and yeah do all the dentist doesnt do, talk to u, u can sense how phony she sounds like. Also the dentist is pushy, pride, boastful and very very arrogant !!! NEVER EVER GO TO THIS PLACE PLS..

Let me summarize this in 1 word = clean.  This place is probably the shiniest eat all you can that serves around the valley and I have been to alot of them. Too many in fact. Here's some of their best foods.  1. Sushi ( huge selection ) try the scottsdale sushi 2. Mongolian beef ( just the right flavor ) 3. Sesame balls!!! (Nuff said) 4. Dessert ( try their mango ice cream) 5. Noodles not the pre cook.

PLEASE READ MY REVIEW ALL YELPERS.  Now i got your attention. I will point out 5 things you will encounter on this event ( I am saving you next year). Each point are 1 star off the rating. Which means I would give 0 star if I can on this event.   First is the ridiculous parking. I mean I have gone to alot of state fair, alot of other events that have tons of parking problems but this is one of the worst parking ever.   Second the execution. There are so much potential but all ends up being a failure. When we got there, the cooking event was cancel on one hour 1 pm i think. The chef cancelled and the people end up just roaming around. The eating contest is host by a boring lady. The band that the lady keep on saying is " worth the penny you pay" is nothing but a bunch of teenagers singing loudly, out of tone out of rhyme on the mic.  There are alot of lines. I mean it. Its like going to Disney Land but instead of ending up on the line and enjoying your ride, you will either have to pay for a sample or pay for the most expensive one bite burger you ever had. There is so much line I have to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes to make a order on one of the truck. Thats under the sun, on a sandy part of the event. There is limited shade and sittings is so lacking. Never again.  Fourth is the limitation of menus. So you know a truck here? and want their best food to offer? Well guess what, they might not have that on the menu. Most of the Truck have only 3-4 dishes to pick on. One truck in particular have 2 mini burgers, I mean mini, smaller than the fist of my niece. NO JOKE. As for the taste, we have taste more, and mind you we tried alot of this trucks, and there are more places in PHOENIX alone that offer better on taste, on portion, and obviously on PRICE!!!!!!!!!  Fifth and maybe the WORST thing ever about this event. The money you will spend in this event is ridiculous. There is the entrance fee, then there is payment for small portion of samples? THE F? ( costco have bigger portion and they dont freaking make you pay for samples) Water cost is 2 dollars. The cost for desserts will land you from 4-6 dollars. The main course foods which may I say are in small portions ( state fair have bigger portions ) are priced at minimum at 8-16 dollars.  So lets recap: 12 + 2 + 4 + 2 +8 = 28 dollars for one head ( this is when u decide one sample, one drink, one dessert)  For 28 dollars we all know you could have gone and go to a upscaled restaurant and even gave a tip. Also thats just one bite. What happens in dinner? another 16- 30 dollars of food?    For my last note, the advertisement on this event are all false, all of the reviews are probably done by someone who works there. No one in their right mind would like to buy a small cupcake for 8 dollars. Also the token system dont make sense, each token is worth 2 dollars, you pay 2 dollars but whats the worth of this inside? 2 dollars!!!! What? why even have another currency (token) when there is no advantage for the patrons on doing so?   This event made me realize that not all the reviews on websites are not true. Oh and they changed their name thats why I wasnt able to find it on yelp, It was previously named Food Truck Festival (last review was on 2012).  Please I would never want you to go through what I and my family went through. This is a money grabbing event. Your way better off going to state fair. Better yet save it for a good restaurant.

Where do we start? The place is hot, dusty, very crowded, and so disorganized. Okay that aside, the reason why were giving this event a 1 star ( 0 if possible) is the false advertisement to  various ticket sellers. They proudly say " trucks are asked to sell food on low price" this is well printed and customer service even answer this question on their website. Well let me save you the precious time, money and save you from getting angry. Not only you have to pay (12) dollars for entrance, you also have to pay parking (5). The websites also says "trucks will gove samples", well were the hell have you seen a place to ask (2) dollars for a sample? Yes! You read that right, samples have prices. Yet this is still not the worst part, when you start to go to their trucks you find out that thr prices are not only expensive it also feels like your getting rip off by the price!!!!! Heres the sample of prices (2 dollars on the following)- eater, soda, 1 minicupcake. (4 dollars) 1 medium size cupcake. (6 dollars) lemonades, shakes, sundaes. 8-16 dollars are the prizes for the maim foods like bbq, burgers, etc. In the end of the day you end up paying 150 ir more just trying foods. With that prize I could have bought a nice dinner and good lunch on a good restaurant. This is not only a rip off, its obviously a misleading event. Oh and did I told you that alot of their foods are mediocre at best? Also some events were cancelled when we went, so unorganized. YeaH WE Will never comeback and will spread the word. Alot of people are still going to it, feels like alot of people dont use yelp ( 2012 was the only event related on yelp).   I hate this event. I really do.

Not good. Frozen sushi is not real sushi. The portion is fine for a sushi place but if someone makes ur sushi in less than 10 seconds something is wrong. The rice is already attached to the roller by the time the girl take it off the cooker. The ingredients looks and taste really frozen. I dont like bashing new upcoming business but this is basically the Mcdonalds of sushi, fast, frozen, bland sushi. If your looking sushi drive 5-10 more miles for other places such as ibachi, teharu, lis bowl, and others around that has real sushi experience. Pls stay away, but if u love mcdonalds or something like that pls feel free to try them, oh just a reminder i ordered 2 sushi and paid alslmost 20 bucks, 20 dollars in teharu can give u sooo much.

Okay my turn. It took me awhile to write my review but I had to not only try the system but also see if there will any mishaps in the security itself. We moved to a house 2 years ago near Laveen, it was quite safe neighborhood area so we did not bother to get any security at all. Yet there have been a steep growth of crimes the surrounding area that us the sign to get one security. That aside, I research for almost 5 weeks on which one to get, houses near us told us different companies but also with different cons and pros. So i decided to hit yelp and in 2 seconds I found JPG, I tell you not I was worried to my brain if this will come true, and having a very paranoid house mates did not help either. I gave Jim a call and was able to setup a appointment in couple of days. In those couple of days not only I tried to call the different companies to see if I can have them give me a price range, I also research Jims company. The more I dig into his stories (creepy isnt?) the more I get confidence that this was the one I needed. The other calls I made before my appointment all fallout, either they didnt have the technicians to come or they simply didnt pick the phone. Anyways Jim came to our house 1 hour early, and also follow up with a day before the meeting. As we inspect the house he also taught us small stuff to protect the house from a break in. His background really made the conversation more comfortable, he was came in the house, not like a salesman but someone who cared to protect the property that we own. My house mates were also amazed on how he presents the alarm system, also how fast the whole ordeal went. It took us less than 1 hour to decide what to get and when to set it up. Jim was pleasant to talk with. After the whole thing we end up having the top notch for only 1/4 of the price. ALL, i mean ALL fees were waived as promised on their website, and all our windows were covered, and there is alot of windows in the house, when he started to count them, I started to think we might pay almost 200 for the installation, but to my surprise, WE DIDNT EVEN PAY A SINGLE PENNY!  I can really go on and on an on!! On the things that made our experience the best we can imagine. In less than 48 hours our security was connected and running. The other guy who came and connected was also early, and was kind. He worked fast and was able to teach us the what to do and not what to do.   We end up getting the alarm that has the phone app, I kid you not, its the best thing ever made by humankind! Think how many times u think you left the garage door open? Think for a second, if you can take that worry off in just a click of a button? This alarm made our sleep better, and outings less worrying.   I dont know if I should mention prices but for 50 dollars our house is 24/7 secured and forever safe (yes even if the electricity gets cut off, or even if wifi is cut off, it still runs.) The system is so easy to use, if you can use a smart phone, let alone a ipad to watch youtube, I bet you can manage a 8 inch touch screen that has less things to click with.  LASTLY, I would like to offer my yelp as  a Q&A for anyone who wants to ask anything about the system. I know u can directly call Jim, but if u want to just want a easy question, I will do my best to answer your question, just shoot me a compliment, (thats the only way i think u can message here, unless Iam wrong) as a question, and I will answer you. Iam mostly on, everyday. So yeah.  I hope this review helps, I can manage to put some more, but the other people who reviewed it speak to its volume. I dont want to say bad things about other companies I never tried but If I would do it again, I will never call anyone else but JIM!!!

The only reason i became a duke o  this fantastic sams is the fact that i had to go here 3 times to get my freaking haircut fix. Patricia is the worst ever on cutting hair.  I can go and gice you 5 reasons why not to come here but theres only 1 big reason you should not ever step into this barbershop- Patricia. I can show you all the pictures of the uneven haircut that i have to deal with because of her. After 3 tries of getting them fix it. I have given up. Even the other person who tried to fix my hair said "just let it grow." What the ??? Really?!! I came in to get a haircut not a disaster. Check pictures to see how bad the cuts are. Oh it started to be a simple faux hawk. It turned out to be this way

Good place to play volleyball in the morning while the sun is up but when the night comes in  the lights are really dim and they dont have much lights that will lit the court. The basketball court also have dim lights. Theres also houses nearby. At first it was funny qhen all you hear are karaokes blazing in then it geta a bit annoying.   Therea alot of shades around but the lights are just nowhere to be found.   More lights and would be good.

This is the best barber place in Laveen.  Trust me for the previous 2 years that I lived here I have gone to 3 barbers around here. Just look at my terrible experience on supercuts@_@   Get Poli his off wednesday, and their off sunday.   Update 2015- i dont know why but it seems like the quality of haircut has decline. I still go here and go almost every other month. My hair grows fast. Yet for the last 2 haircut I have noticed that alot of my hairs are off, or just not right. I dont usually get Poli anymore since my schedule wont allow me to. I usually check my hair before leaving but i never had to do it here before since their haircut usually was spot on.   I will try them again next month but i will be more cautious now.

I love Pho alot. I even travel far and beyond just to tasted pho's everywhere. This place used to be own by another business. I even remember  it cause the people used to be 5-6 rotating for the shifts, yeah that's how often I used to come here. Then they changed owners and the name of the place. I gave them 2 chances at least to get my fave "pho" on the same spot that the former owner had. Unfortunately they did not retained the same flavor. I really tried to give them a fair judgment but when 2 out 2 me and my co-yelper are having the same result, I think it's enough for me to say " it's way too different, and it's not in a good way"  As a reference on the old place, I reviewed them with the same criteria. Basically it goes down to taste, authentic flavor, customer service and of course price. Taste was just not there, as orders said no "wow" factor at all. Just plain and simply, there's nothing that this place offer in regards to that department. 2nd the authentic flavor, which I may say when you tasted so much PHO you want to have that "it's different from this place" taste- there was none here. Nothing made me want to come back except for the fact that the old place had such a food taste and had authenticity.  To add to that me and other yelpers had bad waiting time- :( . Then lastly with the their price, which should be okay if the first 3 was present, it's a bit too pricey for something this bland.  In its fairness it's still a beautiful place to eat if your stranded around the area. Atmosphere is pretty nice- nothing changed from the previous owner. I did however found some PHO places nearby, I don't want to tell their name but yeah 1 of them tasted better.   I hope you guys look at this review and expect what I didn't expected. A bit mediocre on my taste but if your new- pretty sure you can find their flavor still pretty nice. Just not quite for me who have spent some time eating Pho's around the valley.

Came today and try this new resto. Iam full pinoy and my standard of pinoy food is simple and basic: if my grandma and mother can cook better, it should not be served on restuarants.   We ordered 8 things in the menu; Chicken Sinigang na hipon Lechon kawali Nilaga Chicken sisig Pork sisig Pancit miki bihon  Laing  In this 8 items only the laing is what my mom and grandma dont cook. Anyways lets start with the good, the chicken. Its one of the best crunchy and flavored chicken we had in restuarants, my mom agreed its good, and I liked it too.  Unfortunately thats where the good things stops. The other 6 items (excluding laing which was okay regarding to my family, i have no taste for it.) So for the bland foods are the following; pancit and nilaga. It was so bland i have to use 1 spoon full of condiments to make them taste anything. The nilaga was served cold too. Next the super salty are the following; kawali, pork sisig, chicken sisig, all of this items have strong salty taste, too salty that we were not able to eat them all. The last one the hipon na sinigang, they got the "asim" (TANGY) part but they did not catch other flavor than that. This sinigang is missing that unique sinigang flavor.  In the end i was only able to enjoy my plate due to the chicken that was really good. When i was over, i had a full bowl of the soups (untouched) pancit on the side which i tasted only once, the sisigs were just next to my pancit and the other stuff making my entire plate half full.   Oh i would like to add it took the food to come in 35 minutes. I finished the freaking 1 episode of a tv series before they come all together. Which i think is the reason why our soups were cold, if iam not wrong it means that the soups were sitting on the counter but they were waiting for all the foods to be finished before serving them.   In the end Max didnt deliver the filipino food that i expected. Back home they are known for the chicken, i guess they should only stick with that. There are better less known restaurants with real flavored, well served, authentic filipino cuisine around.  Update: last time we went here they had 5 stars it's down to 3 now. Not surprise.

I am a stub member and I have been alot of AMC's places now. Let me tell you about my latest and worst experience yet in a movie house. As a background let me describe the many AMC's I have been to, I experienced the one near Ahwatukee,  the Esplanade, the one near Scottsdale mall, and the one near Westgate and the one at Deer Valley. The chairs in this place is just like in esplanade. But the customer service are terrible.  This is probably the worst AMC's in the valley. I will enumerate the stuff I have found in this that disgust me to my gut.   1st the chair is not clean. Literally. One of our trip here we have report a cup holder having liquid stuff in top of having smears of don't know what on the top of our chairs. Their leather so you could feel the icky feeling of slimy and gross liquid that stays on that chair.   2nd. The kids ( yeah their probably younger than 18) that work on your order are snobby and are slower than a turtle. I have been in Harkins and I could say that service is way faster there.   3rd and probably the worst is their inconsistency. First in our trip we went to watch deliver us from evil. Around 8 pm we went through. With a child with us. No problem. The child loved it. Next and probably our last trip in this freaking place. We wanted to watch Lucy. With the same kid. They stop us be cuase it's their policy for to not let any kid watch anything rated r after 6? Really? Then why was I one able to buy and watch deliver us from evil in our first trip a obvious rated r movie, 2nd why was I able to buy ticket which was showing 720 pm at their website with me indicating I had a child with me? I asked for the manager after traveling 45 minutes to watch a movie, with the kid, excited and with full guardian with him. We were greeted with a ungrateful manager.   To top it of we travel led through the storm. Yes it's raining at phoenix today. August 12 2014. Not only we have not watch a movie we were basically turn down by this manager with no compassion and no consideration. I believe as a customer who poured his money and effort tot get to their movies , I have the right for a compassionate, rightful and considerate way of being treated as a human being.  I will never go watch a single movie at AMC. Better wait them suckers at torrent.

:) my review after 2 months of hiatus and iam back! And my first place to go didn't disapoint! It just became one of favorite place to eat. This place has the best breakfast  burrito I ever have tasted. Miss Irma is so gracious and kind:) you can taste it from her food. Here's the 5 reason why this place should be supported.  1. Locally owned. Heart warming welcome when you get to the door. 2. Clean. Let me emphasize that, very clean. Just check their staff wearing gloves when they serve you:) 3. Price. That price. Check the pictures:) 3.99 for a burrito! 4. Presentation, for a small place their presentation is very impressive. 5. The flavor. Just come and try.   Iam so sure youll like this place that iam willing to  pay your food if you don't like it. For Less than 5 bucks and you'll have a new place to eat.  :) the place is small and in a very hard to find. But I tell you. The trip to this place is worth it.   Again less than 10 bucks for a great food. So great I am pretty sure you'll like it.   Update: brought my family back to taste Miss Irma's cooking. My mom said her beef soup is one of the best beef soup she tasted here, in the valley. That's a compliment that's hard to get. My Family also loved how Miss Irma always comes and say "hi" to their customers. This place  just made my family a believer of local small local businesses. Hope this place gets more attention;)   Yelpers come and try their foods.

What a cluster mess. Decided to join the crowd and try this one more time. Last year we also went to the other one on sxottsdale- seems like we didn't learned the lesson back then, now I will sketch this on my memory so I will never ever forget this madness.   Let's be positive shall we? So what's good this year? The location atleast this year is better than the last few years, still a mess and disorganized but hey there's a free public parking everywhere. This is also free - when we went last year there was an entrance fee. But unfortunately that's were the positive sides ends.  Shall we dwell with the negatives? Let's be fair, first is the price. The price is just out of nowhere outrageous- I would really understand that if they are good mouth watering food but most of this stuff are below average. Next is the debacle of the "free sample". Just read the other reviews in regard to how bad this is being misshandled. Got pictures of trucks putting "NO MORE SAMPLES". Lol.   I would really like to know whose the organizer of this event. It should never be done again. It's what we call a scam. A switch and bait. A freaking misleading ad.  I hate to make such a bad review for events that promote local and food trucks- but in the end of the day, we all worked for the money we use in this events. I really hate people taking advantage of others like this.  What a shame. We will never ever go to one of this again.
