Ahwatukee might not be on most peoples list of places to visit while in Phoenix, but after tasting the great thin pizzas here at Florencia's ... it's strongly suggested that it should be.  This locally owned establishment has a variety of calzones, salads, sandwiches, paninis and pizza ... but IMHO, the pizza is what really shines!  They have a long list of pizzas to choose from (Traditional to Specialty pizzas), but what makes their pizzas awesome is the dough.  The dough is made fresh daily, along with the daily made mozzarella. Combine these two very fresh ingredients with your favorite topping and what you have is a classic style pizza that will take you back to Italy.  They don't over do the pizzas with lots of sauce or flooding the top with toppings.  No, here ... they get it that pizzas are an art form and each custom pizza is a work of art.  They taste great 30 minutes later, but are amazing straight from the oven.  You can go and wait hours at those hip pizzarias that cater to the $$$, but if you just want a great place to chill, have a beer or a glass of vino and amazing pizza ... you have to try Florencia!  Ciao Bella!

What better place for a wolf pack of five guys than to eat steak where the Rat Pack dined?!?  Sure, it wasn't on the strip nor it didn't have any flashy decor; rather, it was dark, walls plastered with pics of famous actors and actresses from the heydays of LV, oozing with rich history. If only the walls could talk ...  As for the food, the quality of meat they prided themselves on wasn't just fluff; the 22oz Ribeye with bone in was very juicy and flavorful. The medium rare steak cut with ease, and the amount of plump fat was just right.  Like other $$$ steak houses, my heavenly creamed spinach was a la carte. Ate it all up.  I'll have to come back again to see how consistent they are. Until then, fly me to the moon ...

This place seems to have its place in local & movie history and has lot of autographed photos of movie stars dating back to the 60's.  It's not too far from ASU and has been around for decades.  Harlows' rises above other morning establishments with fresh typical breakfast dishes as well as great signature meals. Plus, it's not a chain so it has that mom n pop feeling right away as you enter into the restaurant (nothing fancy, but a place that you can sense has down right good eats).  The fresh juice is squeezed daily and their homemade muffins come served to your table piping hot.  We tried a little of all three muffins (blueberry, peach, and strawberry) they had that morning but could only consume little chunks of each because we were so full from our meals.  I had the Eggs Maximillian with chorizo both times I've been here and it still tastes great.  The combination of eggs with chorizo, onions, green chilies, scallions, and salsa on top of bed of home fires is simply overwhelming (In a very good way).  The excitement from the first time had gone away, but the food was still delicious.  I really wanted to get a side of their fresh made biscuits and gravy, but saw the portions and knew that I had to select one dish or the other and not both.  The service is top notch and the food came out quick, hot and very fresh tasting.  The very nice waitresses are never rude, pushy or short tempered. And the prices are very reasonable for what you get; great service, great food at really decent prices.  The only bad thing and it's not really their fault is that the parking is extremely bad (so I heavily suggest carpooling).

Okay, so I came here for with my buddy during a night in Vegas and although the steak and service was awesome, it didn't have the two guys hanging out type of atmosphere. The place was very exquisite and felt very posh, but at the same time seemed more of a "date" or anniversary or even a milestone birthday sort of a vibe. Not a place for two guys to just chow down on some fresh beef, killing a few pitchers of beer and laughing it up.   We had reservations so we waited less than 5 minutes while they made sure our table was properly ready. The dining room is a very tall one story high volume (at least 25' high) area with crown molding and soft lighting everywhere. When they sat us in our high backed curved booth, they literally pulled the table out so we could be seated and then pushed the table back in. Once they knew we were going to have prime rib and steak (as if we came here for a salad), they brought out this huge rolling cart that was domed. Under the dome was a mountain of actual various choices of meat that we could get. My prime rib looked succulent and ready to jump in my belly; my bros steak had just the right amount of marbling for that juicy taste. They tagged the pieces we selected and rolled the cart away towards the kitchen. When the steaks came out, the tender meat seemed to jump onto my fork and just melt in my mouth. I've been to other steak houses and this was one of the best pieces of meat I've had (outside of Texas). The sides were awesome as well; the potatoes, the mac n cheese, the creamed spinach, the bread ... all great. And the drinks were great too; we had a few beers as well as a couple glasses of scotch and finished off with a simple rum and coke.   Overall, the food and service were outstanding but it was the more formal atmosphere that kept the dining experience from falling off the charts.

Lots of character, with oldies playing over head...  -Ordered Bristo Classic Pizza -Stuffed Mushrooms  Service was quick n food came out fairly quick. The stuffed mushrooms were amazing, bursting with flavor and oozing (yes, I said oozing) with cheese. The Pizza was well balanced and the toppings were extremely fresh.  The crust was fine, but nothing super.  Yes, it was better than CPK pizza, but still not the best that I've had (in OC or Phx).  But perhaps that was the down fall. Comparing to other greats ... puts this place at a disadvantage. But if I'm used to only CPK, then I'd be very impressed.  Don't get me wrong, this place has lots going for it and the overall experience was fun and super laid back yet with service that was awesome.  But compared to other pizza places eaten less than 24 hrs ago ... I'd say it isn't worth the long drive if you're coming from South of the 60.

There aren't many authentic Chinese places to choose from in Phoenix and its surrounding areas, but considering this place has both traditional and westernized dishes as well as great dim sum you may not need to go any where else.  I've been here several times; all for a Saturday dim sum with my large family (so we get to try a lot of dishes) and they churn out the food fresh and quick.  The waitresses push the rolling carts of tempting delights stored in steaming bamboo trays stacked several high.  The standard dim sum dishes are all very good and not too greasy (although some are).  And my grandmother tells me the chicken feet are very tender and succulent (I'll trust my grandmothers' word).  If your exposure to Chinese food is only PF Chang or Panda Express, be daring and try some traditional Chinese dim sum one Saturday morning and learn what you might have been missing out.  My relatives will be here this weekend to celebrate the Chinese New Year!

After visiting a tea farm in mainland China, I learned there is not only a difference with taste but also on how the teas level of enhancing your health varies from standard quality all the way to high quality.   Sure, the prices are very high, but the quality of tea is actually of a better quality than what you would find elsewhere (if your tea comes in a tin from Dilmah or Republic of Tea, you know what I mean). And if your only purchases of tea are from Lipton, Celestial Seasonings, Twinings, or Bigelow you will gasp and be totally shocked at the prices.   What I really like is how they have taken the concept of blending teas to create several sensational teas that are so much more robust then the teas separately. It's this artful blending of teas that also demand the higher tea price. So, if you are looking for a good quality tea to drink at home at your leisure, you shouldn't have any trouble finding a tea blend to your liking. But if you just want tea for a one time use, better going to the store and buying a bottle of Tazo.   I've sampled several of the teas, both hot and cold, and all are very good. They use a German rock sugar for some of the teas they sample. But even without the rock sugar the teas are really good. And if you do want the sugar, you can use an alternative like pure cane sugar that is cheaper but is just as good. And if you don't have an air & light tight container, they have a few sizes that are reusable.   Lastly, if the prices are still too high to swallow (no pun intended), I've been told they have sales every once in a while. I'll be looking out for those sales!

Again, thanks to Yelp, was able to look up the location of this store.   The store is well organized, women's shoes on the left; men's shoes on the right. I found a few shoes that looked cool, but had no idea of how they would fit. The really nice girl working their said she could help me choose a shoe based on my walk. I've wanted to have someone examine my walk but never had the chance. After a few walks down the "runway" she gathered enough information to tell me that I, like most people, over pronate towards the inside. She showed me two shoes that would best help adjust for this. I tried them both and felt like I was gliding on air, but didn't really know which one felt better then the other. So, I kept switching shoes, walking around, trying one on each foot and walking some more, and so on.   She was extremely patient because although they had already just closed (we got there 15 min before they closed), she didn't try to push one shoe. So after another 5 minutes, and way past closing, I picked one of the shoes. The overall experience was pretty good, the girl was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about shoes and I felt like I was getting a solid shoe that will help me run better at the gym.   If you are looking for a good shoe, don't go to the "walking" store at the mall across the fwy. You'll get more selection and great service here.

Was here over the weekend and I've been looking for a new pair of running shoes to replace my old Asics.  And because I knew New Balance shoes made running shoes in wide sizes, walked into the store to see what they had.  I saw a few New Balance shoes along the display wall and one they had looked nice and was extremely light.  I asked the guy there if they had this in a size 8-1/2 2E.  He looked at me and after taking a quick glance (dude, I saw you) said that this is their top of the line running shoe and that since most runners are slim, they don't make this model in wide.  Dude, what the hell? You could have easily just told me they don't carry or make that shoe in wide.  I give this place 2 stars only because he told me there was a New Balance shoe across the 101.

I am impatient when it comes to very hot weather. So I'm not about to wait in 100 degree weather for BBQ, the best or not.  Sure, Rudy's is a "chain", but I have to say that it's the best darn BBQ "chain" that's West of the Mississippi!  They have it all; Brisket (moist n lean), pulled pork, pork ribs, Turkey, Chicken, sausage.  It was lunch time, so I figured I'd give their sandwiches a go: the Brisket and the Turkey (hey, I like to eat).  The smoked turkey was so flavorful and tender. For sure surprised my taste buds. But what really got me is the generous amounts of lean brisket that I munched in each savory bite.  It comes dry, but with a little of their sauce ... Yum!
