The service was amazing! The people are friendly, very knowledgeable, and the food was fabulous! I had the tempura bowl for lunch. ot's rice with a little bit of teriyaki dressing, and has a combination of vegetables and shrimp that is fried. It was fabulous, and the breading is not very heavy at all!

Joe DeMarco and his staff at The UPS Store have always taken care of my business needs, and now they do my shipping! I had to ship my daughter's magnets for her wedding announcements; the box arrived on time, in good condition. I also had to ship my son's X-Box to his station in the Marine Corps, and the contents arrived in mint condition. Kudos to Joe and his staff! Always ready to help, pleasant and knowledgeable!

Listening skills need work. Order was placed, repeated, and correctly charged; shorted a small fry & didn't get my burger as ordered (wanted to add bacon and take off onion, didn't happen). Service was okay. Thus is not the first time our order has been messed up but it will be the last. #Wendys location just lost a customer.

You have to try the Crispy-Spiced Salmon Bites with Pineapple Salsa - WOW! You won't be disappointed! Does have a bite, you've been warned!   Service was wonderful! Not too noisy, but I came in on a Wed. night so might be different later in the week. Nice separate meeting room in the back. Great experience!

The pizza is DELISH! Wings are to die for, either boneless or bone-in (I prefer bone-in) with 12 different sauces to try! I'm told petrolatum is a combo of BBQ & teriyaki - gotta give it a go next time! Casual atmosphere with friendly staff, great with suggestions for first-time goers!

Professional & courteous, and tasty shakes! We always have a great experience at Sonic - a frosty place for treats in the middle of the desert!

I went with a friend to attend a networking event. Event didn't happen, but manager Brad and his staff were above professional w/customer service! He even offered to call the other locations to make sure we were at the right spot, then offered us water while we waited!  Courteous, spot-on customer service! Thank you, Brad & staff! :-)

This location is always clean, friendly people, and quick service!  I recommend the family meal (extra crispy of course) & don't forget the cake!

My husband and I tried this restaurant about 10 years ago, and we get back whenever we can! Always professional, courteous service. The food is fantastic! He's trying the pineapple beef; my favorites are the house chicken or shrimp w/lobster sauce & veggies (tonight's dish). Have to order crab angels when we come. It's a great family-owned restaurant & wonderful experience every time we're here!

Stop by & say hello to my longtime friend, Matt Borowski! Delicious food, tantalizing desserts, and  a quiet, intimate decor completes this beautiful spot. Homemade bread from Martha's recipe! The flavors and atmosphere will captivate you & call you softly to return with a friend. I recommend the beef barley soup with turkey sandwich on their homemade bread, and don't skip dessert or you will regret it!

OMG, absolutely THE BEST pizza I've ever had! Fresh ingredients, light crust, delicious toppings! Can't be beat anywhere! Have to come in at least once for the experience! Try grilled chicken, bacon, pesto w/garlic & oil, roasted peppers, fresh mozzarella & parmesean! (Oh and add more veggies of your choice!)

Service was okay, not extraordinary. Not greeted when I walked in, but only one clerk being cashier whole other was stocking, then she stopped to help. No napkins! Not good since I dripped coffee onto my hand & couldn't wipe it off. Also, their coffee was 20 cents higher than QT - what's up with that?? Not the store's fault but the company has to stay aware of that.

First time & I'll definitely be back! Try the Beef Schwarma pita w/hummus sauce instead of cucumber sauce - it's fantastic! People are friendly, great with suggestions, and pay/sign at what looked like an iPad terminal. Convenient & quick!
