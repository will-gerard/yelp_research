OK SO HERES THE DEAL.   I used to love this place. I took family here, mom , grandmas, brother, cousins, the whole shabang . I brought dates here, I brought friends here, I had meetings here, my friends were the ones that brought me here in the first place and I fell in love.   Well honey, that was a year ago, or maybe a few months ago, BUT NOW that has all changed because they CHANGED THEIR MENU.  and its awful.  Long story short, Im a phx native, but I go to school out of state and I had always craved green when I was gone because I wanted GOOD vegan food, that the boca burger and salad crap. So after 14 weeks away I decide to order one of my two favorites and really the only two things i order other than a soynami or wings; the orcettee bowl with no harm chicken parm or the sweet and sour. SO I call to order to go and find out that both of these are NOT on the menu anymore and that they changed their menu literally days after I went back to school. SO , I CANCELED THE ENTIRE ORDER AND WENT SOME WHERE ELSE THAT DOESNT CHANGE THEIR MENU AND TAKE THE BEST THINGS OFF. aka pita jungle.  Literally I am so devastated that i decided to look up other responses to find that I wasn't the only one complaining and that they had changed other things on the menu as well as taken favorites off. They changed their delicious burgers to disgusting boca burgers, and added a bunch of salads.   SERIOUSLY. YOU ADDED BOCA BURGERS AND SALADS? AND TOOK OFF SOME OF THE BEST VEGAN FOOD IN THE WORLD? ARE YOU SERIOUS? I wont eat a boca burger if it was the last thing on earth. Im so sick of going to bbqs and being asked if i want a boca burger. NEXT thing is adding salads? REALLY? did you ever think that salads are really the only thing that vegans can eat at normal restaurants? and you decide to take the good food that vegans cant get anywhere else and replace it with the only thing we can eat.  WOW. THANKS FOR GOING FOR THE STEROTYPE  . VEGETARIAN = ONLY EATS SALADS? REALLY? WHAT ARE YOU GOIGN TO TAKE AWAY NEXT? THE WINGS? THE SOYNAMI? im getting out of there waaaaay before that happens. like maybe now. THANKS GREEN.  you hurt my feelings. :(   I honestly dont think i want to go back im so up set. In fact DONT GO. whats on the menu now is nothing compared to what it used to be.   THE POINT IS:  IF YOU HAD SOMETHING AMAZING WHY CHANGE IT?  if your going to add things to the menu dont take things away. the sweet and sour and the ocette pasta was literally the only thing i ever got there besides wings and a soynami and now what? you may call me stubborn but both of those were so good that all you ever wanted were those two items. If you have the ingredients why not put them back together to make something amazing?  so thanks green for making my homecoming suck because you changed your menu and made it horrible. MAYBE you should just Add on to the old menu and not completely wipe it off the face of the earth.
