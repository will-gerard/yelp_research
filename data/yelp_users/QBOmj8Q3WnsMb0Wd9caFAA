Very impressed with the customer service, and since I was a first time customer, my slice of pizza was on the house. This is something you don't see very often. They have gained a customer for life. Brit, the manager was very friendly, and made it a point to give the history of the establishment and she truly made me feel like i was at home. And to top it off, the pizza was great. Very rarely do I encounter a place were I enjoy being at. Highly recommended this place.

Came in to get a quick bite to eat, but based on the customer service and service from my server(woman server in her 30's with a bun in her hair); I will not be coming back here ever again. I asked for some crackers or bread for my one year old son, and my server seemed annoyed by me asking. I also asked for a quick run-down of the beers on tap, and she quickly answered they are on the menu. I asked this question, because sometimes seasonal beers are not listed on beer list. This server was not only unwelcoming but rude; I understand people have bad days, but when you work in the service industry, you need have your game face on at all times. She also didn't offer if I would like some water for a good 10 minutes. Terrible, terrible service. I will make sure to let everyone I know not to ever eat here.

Great service, great food and an overall great experience. Owner/manager gave me complimentary Red Velvet waffle (which was delicious) for my birthday. We will definitely be back.

I am writing to express my disappointment with today's service, ironically this is not my first time eating here. My first visit to Eggstasy was quite pleasant, and this is why we decided to pay this place a visit again. Based on today's service, I don't that I will be back here anytime soon. My server was not only inattentive but seemed very apologetic when she made a huge error on my wife's order. My wife and I are always very explicit when it comes to not having any pork or pork products in our meal; I let the first 4 mistakes slide (steak not cooked appropriately; hash browns not cooked correctly (to her defense, she did correct this after I told her); other tables being served before us; and having to hunt my server down to explain the mistake on our order). Finally after I expressed my disdain for the service we received, our sever did finally right her one wrong. But what bothers me is, she only righted her wrong, because I had to tell her how disappointed I was with our service. I am not willing to give this place a 1 star, because of our service the first time, but I would hope that management understands that servers need to be extra cautious when it comes to food allergies and requests, because this could be a law-suit waiting to happen.

Great atmosphere, great staff, and spectacular service. A cigar smokers dream palace.
