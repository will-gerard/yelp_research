My family and I have been going here for years and it is always a wonderful experience.  Their food is wonderful... the staff is great... and the meals are decently priced and large enough to share with everybody in your party.  Definitely recommended!!!

This facility is clean, well managed, and well kept.  The shooting range has knowledgable range masters keeping track of people who don't have any idea what they are doing and for those that want some extra time with an instructor... they offer that as well.  Their store is priced about average for a Scottsdale Gun store but don't expect any killer deals/prices on guns, accessories, or ammo.  I've taken 2 classes at this location that were both great and will continue to renew my membership for many years to come.

I feel awkward giving this restrauant the lowest score it's received but I came here based on Yelp! reviews.  The rolls were all specialty rolls so I went crazy and ordered 5 of them. The heart attack roll was weak and the jalepenos were not stuffed at all... The fire and volcano rolls which are supposed to be baked came out cold and tasted extremely bland... And the Mama Mia roll was somewhat decent.  It's a small place and although we got there later in the night I did not expect to be stared at to finish and feel uncomfortable with 10 minutes until close still while they turned all lights off.   I won't be going back.

Bliss has definitely gone downhill.  Save your money and drive a couple blocks down the street and go to The Candy Store.  It has the same lower class strippers with stretch marks and jailhouse tattoos --- except they have boob jobs there.    Bliss is attracting the wrong people with their talent there and hopefully management does something about it soon.  *** UPDATE 09/2014 ***  This review is from 4 years ago when I went to Bliss multiple times over a 12-month period and watched the place fall apart regarding service, talent, and overall enjoyability.  Yet I have current dancers there sending me messages about how I am being rude to the dancers because of my comments.  If you were there 4 years ago then you were probably part of the problem.  If you are new then you are either part of a good transition or the same crappy talent from before... So stop messaging me.  It's a strip club people... Nobody (male or female) walks in hoping to find overweight, ugly, toothless women to "entertain" them.  We can get that walking through the residential Wal-Mart.  Instead crowds come here to enjoy drinks, friends, and in all honestly... the scenery.  So if you're mad about my review of the talent four years ago, then oh well.  I haven't been back since and I hope the business is doing better than before.   Enjoy Yelpers!!!

There is always good stuff to find at the Maxx.  This store is a great way to kill an hour looking for something and end up spending 10 bucks.

Decent BBQ food but nothing to scream about... but be prepared to have a TON of food to eat.

If you like Steak Burgers... this is your place.  To anybody who is used to the typical hamburger, you might not be a fan of a steakburger... just sayin'.  Their custard is absolutely amazing.

Azool Grill has great food and a great bar for after dinner drinks if you want to stick around!  I've had at least 10 things from the menu and have never been disappointed with anything.  From fish and fries to the one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever ordered, the food never seems to amaze me.  Sandwiches, pastas, salads... it's all absolutely great!!!  Meals range from $10-$15 each..  The bar has several beers on tap along with a larger line of hard alcohol.  Prepare to spend about $5/beer when though.  There is no such thing as happy hour either, so these prices are the same all of the time.  The staff and owners are what keep this place running.  There is a consistant stream of regulars that come through the doors and the staff makes each one of them feel at home.  You're always greated by somebody when you walk in the door and seat yourself and that type of attention keeps customers coming back for more.  The venue has two sides to it... both that have bars and dining areas available.  Big screen televisions and a projector television in the rear room show as many sporting events as possible while even broadcasting the occassional UFC fight.  A jukebox, pool table, Golden Tee arcade game, and electronic darts make sure that there is plenty to do while you are drinking and relaxing with company.  The patio is usually filled with those that choose to smoke, but if you can catch it empty at sunset, it's nice to sit and just watch the traffic go through the parking lot with a cold drink in your hand.  ** Side Note ** --- the side room of the restaurant is available for private functions as well so you can have your own party there.  My wife and I did this for an event and we couldn't have been happier with the food selections and preperation and staff availability/friendliness.  Very reasonably priced too for your own private bar with full staff and your very own restroom!!!!  Enjoy!!!!

Waste of money and time. I understand a surcharge for convenience... But a 200% markup is ridiculous. Owner is rude too.

Hopefully this was the first of many times I will be attending Basis New American.  If this place was in a more crowded part of the town where there was more business I would guarantee it would be packed.  My family and I were one of three tables in the entire restaurant the entire time I was there and as you can see by the other reviews on Yelp... this place is awesome.  My four year old sat down with us and the manager realized they didn't have any crayons.  So about 10 minutes later he walks up and hands us a box of crayons with a store receipt still in his hand because he had just ran to the store to purchase crayons!!!  Talk about service!!!  We had the tasting selections ($15) and everything was great, the cheeseburger which was absolutely delicious, and the lobster cheeseburger which was fantastic too.  Here's how you know a restaurant takes pride in their food --- Their kids meals are awesome.  The chicken fingers weren't your typical chicken fingers you throw in the french fry oil and just fry up.  They were battered actual chicken pieces that made me feel like I should have paid more than the $5 it cost!  Sweet Potato Fries FTW!!!  They had a wine bar off in the corner that nobody was sitting at which I thought looked like a great place to sit and have conversations with people... maybe I will try that out soon.  Wonderful atmosphere... wonderful wait staff... wonderful food... will definitely be going back!

If you don't like something on the menu... no big deal... they have 100 other things to try.  This menu is quite possibly the second largest menu (behind cheesecake factory) that I have ever seen.  And this is just the food!  My personal favorite is the Parm Crusted Chicken.  Did I mention that this was a brewery that had some great beers as well?  There are very few seasonal beers I can tolerate but every season BJs releases a new beer (even if it's a repeat from last year) I am amazed at how delicious it tastes.

I eat at Dickies at least once a week so I may be a little biased when it comes to writing this review.  The food is always awesome, hot, and filling.  I always get the sandwiches but the one time I got the meat plate it was good as well.  All you can eat pickles... all you can drink soda (with that awesome crushed ice)... all you can eat ice cream... and three different BBQ sauces to choose from?  What more can you ask for?    How about 32 ounce domestic beers for $3.50... two big screen TVs that are always playing sports... and a friendly and awesome staff always there to offer tips on types of food if you're feeling ambitious to try something new.  -- Waffle fries are awesome... -- Baked beans are delicious... -- Mac and Cheese are shells that are kind-of odd if you are used to the Kraft box style like I am... -- Side salads are small but you get the point...  Make sure to say hi if you see me there on a weekend day!! :)

I decided to try this place due to Yelp reviews and obtaining a restaurant.com certificate.  I read the reviews of others before I ordered my food so I could ensure I got only the best.  - The Fried Pickles are absolutely fanFRICKENtastic. - Sweet Potatoe fries were a little on the over cooked side. - Wife ordered a mushroom/swiss burger which was fairly simply and she said it was decent. - I made my own with Spicy BBQ sauce, pineapple, bacon, lettuce, and all kinds of other sloppiness.  I went through a lot of napkins to eat this burger which made me very pleased.  I don't know if I'd pop in there on my own if I were in the area considering I like several other burgers served in the area much better, but it surely did not disappoint.

Being a fan of Chicago style food I had to go to Joeys when it opened. I usually go to Lukes which is in Scottsdale and figured this had to be the same. Boy was I wrong.   The hot dogs were very small and the chilli dog had cheese that was ice cold and not even melted on it. The hamburger and fries that my family ordered weren't anything to scream about either.   I will continue going to Lukes and not Joeys.

I wrote a really long review for mellow mushroom once before but I'm not seeing it anymore for some reason so I'll state the quick pointers.  1.  The pizza is awesome.  Yes, it takes longer than 10 minutes to cook a GOOD pizza... so sit tight.  2.  The meatballs are amazing.... try them.  3.  Their beer selection is by far the best selection in the North Valley HANDS DOWN.  4.  The wait staff / management is super-friendly so don't be afraid to losen up and meet some new people while they are serving you.  5.  Happy hour is 1/2 all alcohol and appetizers... need I say more?

When asking about the food at the restaurant, the employee went on and on about the sandwiches that were available and how good they were.  Being that the rest of my party wanted pizza, we ordered a pizza.  The pizza is thin crust pizza.  When I say THIN crust I want to emphasize THIN.  The pizza came out on a plastic rectangle tray and not on a pizza dish or even pizza-style plate.  I'm not necessarily all about presentation and prefer taste over presentation, but don't serve me my food on a plastic tray you would find in Taco Bell, Burger King, Fill in the blank here..  Back to the taste of the pizza...  We ordered just a simple plain pepperoni pizza and we couldn't even pick up the pizza without it falling apart.  It was like attempting to pick up a wet noodle and hold it straight while eating it.  I would not recommend this pizza to ANYBODY.  The staff was helpful and very friendly, while the setting was somewhat quaint and small.  Somebody try the sandwiches and let me know!  Large 16" Football Shaped Pizza ---- $16 Free refills on soda while you are there dining in!

I need to preface that I've been to this location two other times and had 3-star experiences.  This last time though.. .if I could give a 0 I would.  - We sat there for 45 minutes before I finally had to ask our waitress what the deal was with our food (there were three meals ordered and other tables had sat, eaten, and left already).  - When confronting the waitress she offered free beer while we wait which sounded nice... until they were dumped into my lap while she sat there astonished.  - When the food finally came out I realized that there was a distinct black hair in my orange chicken that did not belong to any of us... I about lost my cool after sitting there for an hour without so much as an apology.  Finally after sending back the food, the owner comes over and tells me that my meal is going to be free, in which I tell her that our entire dining experience is going to be free and if she doesn't like it, too f-ing bad.  She didn't even come back and talk to us but sent the waitress back over to tell us that everything was free.  1.5 hours, jeans soaking wet from beer, and leaving without food?  I will NOT be attending this place again.  The service has sucked EVERY TIME I've gone here.  My Wendy's Club Sandwich on the way home was delicious.
