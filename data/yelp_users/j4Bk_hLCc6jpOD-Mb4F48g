I love the staff at this store. They are the reason I keep coming back.  This store is usually very busy - however the employees take the time to talk to you, get to know what's going on and really build a relationship with their customers.    Any Starbucks can make you a drink - this Starbucks is more about the experience.

Great atmosphere. Great Staff.  The food is excellent.  I enjoy the water feature inside the restaurant, and the music they play over the speakers is positive and encouraging music.

Better than Starbucks anyday!  The staff encourage their customers to get creative and provide new drink suggests to add to their list such as "The Annihilator".. My personal Favorite: "The Cookie with a little raspberry"

I would eat at Jimmy Johns every day if I could.   Great atmosphere, employees are all quick to say hello! "Subs So fast you'll freak" is more than just a slogan - by the time I paid for my sub and filled up my cup with my drink, the sandwich was done and in front of me.   To top it off, the food is absolutely delicious!

Went to this place about a month ago. The place was not busy, the only server seemed to be working the bar also.  My order was taken quickly, food delivered quickly and it was hot. It seemed overly salty. I was never asked how my food tasted, my beverage sat empty while the server gave all her attention to the 3 people at the bar. Never was offered a refill. After this experience, I wouldn't go back.  I drove by last week and it looked closed - had a "remodeling" sign in the window.  Even if they re-open, I doubt that I'd go back.

I was very dissatisfied with Sky Zone. The staff was inattentive and were more interested in talking to friends than paying attention to what was going on in their section.  In the Dodgeball arena, one child was intentionally throwing the dodgeball at other kids faces.  He was asked to stop by the other kids, but the staff didn't respond. The staff only acknowledged it after my child was hit in the face and started to cry. Then they went into "cover our backside" mode.  Since the staff refused to address the child - I did and told him to knock it off. VERY VERY unpleasant experience and I will not return.

I have been a fan of Dutch Bros for several years! When they finally opened a shop in Peoria I was THRILLED. It seems it was a great idea because they've actually expanded to a 24 hour location!   The staff is always excited to see you when you drive (or walk) up. They do more than just make coffee, they get to know you, they remember you and make every experience awesome!  I have been to all of the Dutch Bros in the Phoenix area - and by far this is my favorite, but I've NEVER had a bad experience with any Dutch Bros store.   Very Highly Recommended!

I'm a die-hard Dutch fan. The staff here are always friendly. They love their customers.  Dutch Bros promotes  the theme that they are "about MORE than just coffee" which is very visible in their philanthropic ways - the corporate office, local franchisees and employees are always giving back to the community.    Dutch Bros is all about the experience. Every visit is a GREAT visit.

After battling with the company that installed my AC for service - and the lack of common courtesy that was offered by them, I was introduced to Clark by a friend.    First, they took the time to get to know me on Facebook, learn about my problem. Second, they were honest and up front even when the news they had to deliver may not have been the best (Personally, I gave them the wrong model #, so they looked for the wrong part)  Third, they went out of their way to make sure that I knew the process and how they could make sure my problem was resolved.  In two words I can summarize how this company is different and BETTER than my last company: CUSTOMER SUPPORT

Three days ago I was introduced to Clark Heating & Cooling.   Two days ago, I was told how and when they could fix my AC unit and how much it would cost. Two days ago, they sent their tech out to check out my unit to make sure they got the right parts - even had the tech come back out that night because he wanted to double check what he wrote down.   One Day ago, they sent me a text to let me know, "Hey we got the part and will be there at 8 AM tomorrow to get your AC running!"  This morning at 10 minutes until 8 AM, their tech arrived. By noon, my AC was working again.   Dave and his team have been consistent. The were here when they say they would be. The job took the amount of time they said it would. They charged me the exact amount they quoted me. They even apologized that they couldn't do the repair yesterday because they were already booked - remember, I called them at the last minute - they could have easily pushed me back, but they didn't!  They have earned my loyalty and I highly recommend them!

I went to NY Slicers for the first time today. Being from back east, finding food that reminds me of home is not the easiest.  This place is the real deal. The sandwiches are delicious, the portions are generous and the staff - let's just say, they remind me of back home!   They are open limited hours to cater to their prime customer base, I wish they were open later in the day so I could go outside of work hours.    Very impressed and I WILL be back.
