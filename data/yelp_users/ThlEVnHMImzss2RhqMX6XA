It is a sweet tooth heaven!  Personally, I do not buy all of my groceries here as they can get bit expensive but I do visit AJ's for many other things such as flowers, fruits&veggies and my all time favorite BAKERY!  The have an amazing selection of cakes, pastries, and any other sweets you may crave. For many different occasions I ordered cakes from Aj's and it was never disappointment.   My all times favorite is their big fruit tart cake. It is dangerously delicious. Order it for your next event if you like fruit tarts and believe me, you will nor regret it.   Fruits and veggies selection is great. I love to go there for some of my seasonal fruits and veggies. They absolutely have great selection. Same goes for their flowers selection. From nice, fresh birds of paradise to Lilly,s to - you name it.   The staff is always nice and friendly as well. I am glad AJ's is part of my neighborhood.

This review is solely based on hostess service at Camelback/7st location.   We were so hungry  and craving pasta from Oregano's. Knowing that wait can be long, we called as we were  three minutes away to make sure the wait is not going to be 40 minutes.   The guy on the phone told me that they had several tables inside and few outside. We pulled in three minutes later and based of hostess greeting us, I should of known it will not go well.   She takes our name, barely greeting us and does not tell us about how long the wait will be at all. I see tables outside but she is not even going to check and see if they are available. Five minutes in, we change our outside table to inside one since at this point we are not getting seated.   She changes it without telling us again, how long the wait will be. At this point, I am super hungry and getting a little frustrated.   I finally ask another hosted who was cheat cheating there, how long will out wait be? She tells us 20 minutes! I was so mad at that point. Empty tables, which I can see with my eyes and after ten minutes of waiting they tell me, oh the wait will be 20 minutes. The place is clearly slow.   I know that sometimes they might not have enough chefs, servers....but please. This was such an awful experience. My time and money are imported to me as they are to everyone else and when somebody disrespects it-not good.   We walked away, as I was not ready to leave my money there after that treatment. So sad as I wanted the pasta and I always had good service at this Camelback Oregano's!   I recommend that hostess get some additional training on how to communicate, especially when you are working in the industry where hungry people are at your door at all times.

I have been going to this store for over 10 years.   One thing I love about it is the uniqueness of it. It also brings me that much closer to a motherland with all the product they have.   I enjoy diversity of products. It is a great place for cool gifts. Staff is always friendly and helpful. However, I must say, this location is always super busy, so make sure you have some patience prior entering.   This place just makes me happy. I can just  go there and walk around for an hour....However, it is really hard to leave without spending money. Each time I go, there is always something new I find.   It is also perfect for Holiday gifting.

I can't say enough amazing things about this Trader Joes.   The other day I went to the store to get my groceries done, which I really enjoy. After spending over an hour picking up everything I needed, finally I made it to the friendly register personnel.   She was amazing. All my groceries bagged and what do you know... My debit card does not go through . I don't have back up card. After she tried couple of times and no luck, she asks for the manager to help her.   They tried every possible option but no luck. It was a debit card from Chase and I had this problem before. So I decide to call them.   Long story short, they couldn't do anything because their system were down. Horrible, I couldn't use my own money.   Enough about awful Chase, I am writing this review about my all time favorite grocery store. I apologized to them and told them my hideous bank can not do anything since their systems were down. I felt bad that they will have to put all of the groceries back.   They said no need to apologize and said they were sorry I had to go trough the hassle. Not only that they showed sympathy but the manager would not let me leave the store without packing some dinner on Trader Joe's. How amazing are they?  I was bit embarrassed  of the whole situation even though it was clearly my banks fault, I must say Trader Joe's took that away and made me feel comfortable and safe.   Thank you Trader Joe's for being you, for being simply the best!!!

I started seeming Kari a while back. She does my eyebrows and skin treatments. Kari is the best!!!! She is very welcoming and she makes you feel right at home. Explains everything well and makes sure you are satisfied.  The room where waxing and skin treatments are done is very zen. It is clean and peaceful .  She offered full waxing services as well as several skin treatments including chemical peel. Many different kinds of customized facials and chemical peels.   Prices are great as well and they run monthly specials as well. Let's just say chemical peel is half price then what it costs me at my dermatologist office.    The best at of all of this is that Kari uses PCA skin product. This skin care line is purely amazing and it has been invented locally in Arizona. It is so light weight and it recovered my skin from acnes. PCA also has aging line.  I can't say enough how great PCA skin product is as well as Kari. You will have to check it out yourself and believe me, you will not regret it.

I have been going to this location for a while now.   So far, I get a really good service even though I do not see a same person every time I go.   Girls are helpful and friendly. Office is clean and organized. Front desk id very responsive and organized as well.   I love, love the prices the most. The salon, compering to many other places has great prices and deals.   The only down side for me so far is the fact that I have to drive from Central Phoenix all the way to Shea and 90th street. Nut then, that should tell you something about the place ;)   I would highly recommend it and I already did to many of my friends.

I just love their fish tacos.   I was in the neighborhood and needed a fast fix,,,I was happy when I saw Rubios sign.   Gentleman that was helping me was super nice and polite. He put my order in and it was delivered to my table in a timely manner.   Place is nicely kept. Very clean, organized, and salsa counter was also very well taken care of.   Fish taco was the bomb.   Great fast food to have around when your fish taco cravings kick in.

We went here for a quick lunch today while waiting for my boyfriends sister to have a baby at Arrowhead Hospital.   It was a great experience.   Service was exceptional. Wish I remember the name of our server. He was super nice and helpful. Food came out in timely manner.   There was seven of us and everybody liked their food and atmosphere.   If you are in the area, I would for sure recommend this place! Lots of choices of delicious pastas, salads, pizzas, etc.

First, I would like to take the opportunity to thank all of you who recommended this place to me.   I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner.   He was absolutely stoked!   It all started with the entrance through the kitchen (Goodfellas style)!This was one of his favorite parts as he loves the movie.   Then, we were greater by a friendly hosts who escorted us to our table. Our server showed up shortly after and the party has started.   For start, they bring you this amazing bread roll, soaked in olive oil and topped with mixture of leaks and few other greens. Then complimentary plate of raw vegetables served on bed of ice. Amazing!  We started of with some cocktails and deep fried chicken liver for appetizer, which was delicious. For the main course, we both ordered 8 oz. Filet Mignon that was served with super fluffy and delicious mashed potatoes. Easy 10 stars for the main course. The Filet was cooked to perfection and was melting in my mouth like butter.   The dessert was complementary on the house for a birthday boy! We choose to share Creme Brûlée Trio for which, I easily give 5 stars.   The atmosphere was super nice. It made us feel like we were somewhere in New York. The story about the restaurant was super cool and our server was kind enough to share it.   Expect great food, atmosphere, service but also expect to pay $$$$ for it. For special occasions, absolutely worth every pennie!

Always did, still do, and always will love this place.   The only hesitation is the space. it makes me claustrophobic when I go there for dinner.... People sit on top of each other at the restaurant and hopefully I have table by the exit door in case of fire while eating dinner there....  Parking is also a hassle but i guess that makes the place more special. I can deal  with the parking no problem, it is just the restaurant space and so many table close to each other.

My friend recommended this place to us and we decided to go and check it out.   It was Monday when we went and they their Monday special was $5 burger. We decided to start there for the first visit.   Our server was super friendly. We told him it was our first time here and he made sure to give us all needed information. We got the same treatment from him as if we ordered the most expensive item on the list. That is what I call great service.   Our food arrived and I must say, we were both really happy. I would of paid full price for that burger as well.   On the end our server came with the biggest piece of an ice-cream cake I have seen. It was on the house for us to share. How nice was that?   If you go, I can't promise you free ice cream cake, but I can promise great service, great food, great ambiance....You need more?   Thank you Feeney, we will see you again soon!

Great overall experience!  I went to Urban cookies on the Day of Valentines, even though I do not celebrate it because it is override it in my opinion - I still stopped by to get some delicious sweets for friends and family.   As always, amazingly delicious cookies, cup cakes - you name it.   Service was great as well. Ladies were really welcoming, helpful and fast!  Please swing by and you will not regret it. Support your very, very sweet and delicious local business!

Great, healthy pizza.   Zpizza has a ton of great, fresh ingredients to choose from. A lot of the sauces and toppings are organic too! Additionally the wheat crust is amazing! Oh and to top it off; they deliver.Can't beat that.   My favorite pizza here is Casablanca. I could eat entire one by myself and I am not ashamed of that. Hahaha...  It is a great place in my neighborhood when you want good pizza delivered to your home. Sometimes, you just want to stay in and enjoy comfort of your home in a company of good pizza.   Cuztomer service is grean and place is really neat if you prefer to get out there and eat!

It is cheap, fast, and unhealthy ;)   However, we all need a quick fix once  in a while and this place does it for me.   It was my first time on this location. In places like this, I do not have high expectations. Service was descent.   Usually, you are in and out. For that reason I am giving them 4 stars.

There is only one thing I keep not likening about one of my favorite local bar/restaurant. The fact that tables are so close to one another, especially outside.   I understand that restaurant wants to make money, but they are pushing a line with putting people seat so close to each other.   Every time I go there, I can feel guests next to me breathing on me. Little privacy would not hurt so much...Especially when business is always booming and that extra table will not make a huge difference if it is not there.  For everything else, I give this place 5 stars...Service, food, drinks, etc....

I have been to this place many, many, many time.   It never disappoints.   I am purely in love with their tortas and even though their are bit out of my way I do not mind driving when I crave torta.   Service is also great and I love laid back atmosphere.   Food is super filing and super delicious.   When you have your cheating day and want something filling and greasy but yet so good, please go and check them out.   . Muchas Gracias Los Reyes crew!!!!!

We stopped here for a happy hour and it was an awesome experience hence it is connected to the mall.   Happy hour food was great, fast, and fresh! Beer, I don't have to talk about that... Never disappoints:-)   We sat at the bar and my boyfriend was happy as he could watch the goofball game while I was writing this review. Our bartender was really friendly, exposing menu to us and helping us pick the right choices.   Music could be little louder and air condition lower.   We are for going to swing by next time we are at the mall!

Went here for the first time for work lunch and must say, the first impression was not bad.   I am glad that there is a decent sushi place by my work.   Service was really good, food was good, and I am planning to go back for sure. I ordered their bento box and I was impressed as it does come with a lot of food. Besides sushi, my favorite item out of the box was their tempura vegetables.   One ting I did not like is how cold it was in there. I was shivering the entire time. When I go back, I will bring a blanket :-)

Decided to have lunch outside office and was craving a soup.   I must say, I was never so disappointed in service at this place as I did this time. All employees were so down and not so friendly. Place was not so busy and a lot of tables had dirty dishes on them so I couldn't choose to seat at them.   I must of had high expectations for this place but this visit confirmd for me, it is just another overrated chain.   Sorry PB.

I had the worst experience ever!  I was on my lunch brake; therefore, I didn't have 3 hours to spare....  Not only that i waited for a cup of soup and salad for a while - it was inposiblle to find a seat. It was really frustrating.   On top of it all, service was not good either. Our cashier  was on the phone while we were waiting to place our order. What happened to days where customer that makes a drive has a priority over somebody on the phone.   The place is very crowded. After we finally got a seat, I felt other customers were seating at my table. You really got no privacy/space at this place unless you are lucky to grab a boot.   Unfortunately, it was a bad experience for me and I do not think, I will be going back anytime soon........

Love. Love Chipottle but not this location.  The staff was not so friendly and they were speeding me trough the process like the place was on fire. Once I got my order, it was the smalls portion I ever got at chipottle and did I mention how hungry I was? Starving!  My boyfriend ordered his usual burrito and also was so disappointed. Salsa that he asked for was not even in there and it was the smallest burrito he has ever had at Chipottle. He said, it was mostly tortilla that was served to him.   It was not a good experience for me second time at this location and the only reason I go to this one is becasue it is right by my office.   Never did I experience this type of service at the Chipottle by my house....No bueno Happy Valley....

This place was recommended to me by my dear Indian friend.   It was Sunday and I was craving some good Indian food.   He mentioned this place couple of times before and I finally made it there. He warned me that on Sundays they have buffet style food and that I should not have as high expectations as I would if I went on regular day and ordered from the menu. Despite what he said, I wanted some Indian food then and I took a risk and went.   There was four of us that went. We walked in to the restaurant through their convenient grocery store. The restaurant was full of happy faces and that was enough for me to take a seat  and join the happy crowd.   One of the employees warmly  welcomed us in and explained how the buffet works. She was really nice.   They had a lots of options on their buffet and we made sure to try it all. It was a big success. Everything we tried was delicious. Chicken Tikka Masala was awesome! The Naan bread was excellent as well.   My recommendations are to try everything and you won't regret it.   They even came to our table and offer to make us fresh Puri. I am so glad I said yes! It was heavenly.   The ambiance was great. The restaurant was a bit outdated but still great family ambiance.   There it is my friends - you must check this place out!

This place has recently been introduced to me by one of my friends and I fall in love.   It is absolute treasure that is been hiding for me whole this time I lived in Arizona. Thank you JIll for taking me.   I love everything about it.   We went in the morning and had breakfast there , which was amazing. Then we took a stroll around the farm and it was extraordinary. I felt like I was in La la Land.   The food was fresh, with ingredients picked from the farm. Market was full of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as local products such as breads, honey, pickled items, juices, etc.   There was local band playing as well while we were there. I tell you such a happy little place.   I am for sure going back to zen out and enjoy the scenery and so should you ;-)

As a first timer, I was impressed!  I am hooked on PHO now and I must say, for sure going back to this place.   The atmosphere was great. The place was packed with smiley faces as it looks like everyone has been enjoying their food.   The service was great and straight up. What you see is what you get :) They were really fast as well.   My favorite of all was their Vietnamese coffee. It was the BOMB.   I am for sure going to be a regular customer here.

We went here few times to pick up our order.   Everyone was super nice and welcoming.   While waiting for food, they always offered something to drink. Place looks nice and clean.   Many pasta selections to choose from. Just be aware, pizza is pretty small size and if you are super hungry,perhaps you might not want to share it.

I was at Happy Valley location last week for lunch.   Casual atmosphere, not to bad of a service either.   Then I checked my banking account and found out that I was overcharged! My bill was around $27 and change and I was charged $57 and change. I have used a $10 groupon and after that, my bill should have been $17 and change plus tip.    Immediately, I called the restaurant, which was early in the morning.   One of the employees who answered the phone claimed she was a manager and she is unable to help me; however, she will take all of my information and manager "Brian" will call me as soon as he gets in. 8:30PM, I am not receiving my call and I decide to call again.   Employee puts me on hold for Brian "the manager". He pretty much tells me to wait out until Wednesday as they have been experiencing a lot of problems when groupon is used. Per him, everything should correct itself. He also said he would give me a call first thing Monday morning and its about 1:15PM and still no call.   I am really disappointed on how this matter is being handled. I understand it is $30 and for the manager at Mallow Mushroom that may not be a lot but for me...It is. It makes me mad that he would not even have a courtesy to give me a call....What would happened if I never checked my statement? How many people were overcharged like this and never cut it?

Yesterday, I started 5:30am class at this yoga studio. I am on day two today and I must say as sore and as hard it is in the beginning, it is so worth it on the end. I feel amazing afterwards. The studio is clean and so far instructors have been friendly. I did Bikram for a while and wanted to try this studio. It's little different and I like it. Even though it can be real loud at the times to where it is hard to hear instructor, I like that they play music in between.   The only thing I was not extremely impressed with Is that I thought it will be bikram with little flows in between. I am use to Bikram paste and for heated room some of the poses were little tense. My heart was racing so fast....  I will keep pushing my self to go and get better with my practice... And so should you. Get out there, it's amazing!

This was our 4th time at this place.   The only reason we gave it another shoot past Sunday is because it is so close by our house and we were craving sushi.   We waited almost 30 minutes for patio table while seating at the bar and looking at 3 empty tables and no people in line. When we set at the bar to order drinks while we wait for table, it took waitress good 15 minutes to fix our drinks.   When she brought our drinks, she placed so far away from us and while she was putting them down she was talking to customers that were behind her. Awful.   Finally we go to hostess and ask her when will we get our table? Magic happens and she seats us right away at tables that were empty entire time. Reason behind it - they were understaffed. How is this my problem?  Finally at our table, greeted by our server who never even brings us a water and she never did until we asked for it. We ordered so much sushi and we had to ask her on several occasions which sushi is which.   Never did anybody check on us to ask how was the food?    I understand that you can be understaffed; however, acknowledgement of that or explanation would of been really helpful.   This restaurant has a great location but it lacks a good service. Perhaps better management.

This store is place to go when you are on a budget and need a quick fix.   It's fast, cheap and people are helpful and friendly.   I am just not fan of 30 pairs of same pants on the table... And 100 shirts.... Too much stock on floor . It would be way easier to shop if there was less merchandise on the displays.

I'll tell you a little later how Restaurant managed to serve me the tastiest food but yet was able to disappoint me at the end, but first, let me tell you about how I met the world's nicest server on this evening.  I took my fiancé to this great restaurant for his birthday. Reservations were made ahead. We were seated and the fun has begun. Our server was such a refreshment. He was polite, knowledgeable, personable, funny, and more.... We decided to go with a tasting menu and he was sure to explain to us of what we should expect. Overall, the service was great and it is almost comparable to first-class service of French Laundry :-)   The ambiance was very zen like. This restorante is great for special occasions.  They only have 8 tables. Very intimate and personable historic, two bedroom house in downtown Phoenix. The place is really easy to find as it seats right across from famos Pizzeria Bianco.   They are open 7 days a week but I highly recommend that reservations are made prior your visitation as they are really small and popular place. They start serving dinner at 5PM and are open for lunch from 11am to 2pm.    Both of us really enjoyed the food very much as it took us to Japan and opened up our palette. My favorite were sashimi's for which, I am definitely going back :-)   The only catch to this evening was that I did find a little bit odd that they didn't do anything special for the birthday boy. He was served the same desert as i got without a single candle or any acknowledgment of his special day. When I originally called to make the reservations, I was advised that they do something little for b-day guests but I must say we got nothing.   For me, it is not about the free desert, I can pay for that - it just the principal. It would of been nice to get at least a candle for such a special occasion, especially at pace where one drops over $300 for dinner for two :-)  We are definitely going back and highly recommend this place to those with deep pockets ;-)

I just discovered this place, which is right by my work.   It was a really nice find. Being from Central Phoenix, I get picky with coffee shops.   This place is not a chain and that is what hit the spot for me.   I had lunch there. My order was vegetarian crapes. It was super Delicious; however, I must say that crapes were not the best crapes I have had.   However, let me mind you I am a crape guru. Being from Europe, we grow up eating super crapes so I get really picky and judgmental when it comes to those.   Service was super nice and I liked how we were introduced to all employees when we first walked in. They were all ready to help and answer any questions we may have.   Place was very cozy with the big holiday tree and a lots of decorations.   I will for sure go back because not only that I liked their coffee but the fact that they had savory and sweet crapes was pretty awesome!

When I do not bring my lunch to work, Like to grab a quick sub here...  Every time I went, it was always a great experience!  Service is great and fast. Employees are especially friendly. Food is fresh and delicious.   Even though I always order the same thing, they always get it exactly the same. My fav item is Turkey Breast and Provolone - Mike's way and no onions. Makes me happy every time! Subway who?

I was pretty impressed with not only food but service we got.  My boyfriend picked us food from this place few times but this was my first time going in.   Our cashier girl was extremely nice! She explained and answered any questions we had. Her beautiful smile and kindness will for sure take us back for more of great Persian food.   Also, the portions per my opinion are pretty big. I always have leftovers next day.   I also like that they have Groupon deals often.

Me and my boyfriend stopped here with his brother-in-law.   He was looking for a box of cigars to share with his friends and family on becoming a new dad.   Great service. Very helpful sales person. He took his time to explain all different types and hooked him up with great deal.   I would highly recommend this place.

Aside from crazy hot day, I was impressed with Food Truck Friday!   It was my first time and I can't wait to go back.   Music was playing, food smelled well from every direction and there were "misters"!!!! I ended up getting short leash hot dog, no surprise there and also got Mojo smoothie to kill a hot day, at least temporary.  There are for sure many more food trucks that I would go back and try food from...in the mean time, I would recommend this experience for everyone out there. It's a "must" thing to do in Phoenix Downtown

We went for a drink with friends and everyone really enjoyed it.  The atmosphere was great. DJ spinned great music and the views were spectacular. It is a great place to go with group of friends locally.   Service was great as well. We have not had any food but next time, I for sure want to try some!  The only recommendation I have is, perhaps is better signs on how to get there. Because, once my friends got on the correct floor, they were not sure which way to go.  Please make sure if you are Downtown, to stop by and grab a drink at LUSTRE.

My favorite meal of the day is breakfast.   Today was my first time at Vovomeena and I was so impressed. The entire experience was amazing!  The atmosphere is just great. Very chic ambiance, nice art, wood detail on the wall....Loved it.   The service was great as well. Everyone was really nice and helpful.   The food, I must say was my favorite part. I had Savory Crapes and I will dream about them tonight. They were amazing. My boyfriend had BMOC and he was really happy with his order as well.   This place is just one more reason for me to love breakfast even more so.   I am so glad we found this place and mostly glad we live in the coolest part of Phoenix that is full of cool new local places like this one.   Thanks Vovomeena and thank you Mid/Central Phoenix!

It was my first time ever at Portbelly and boy was I a happy customer.   The employees were super friendly and welcoming. Especially, lady that made our food, she was exceptional. Mind that this is kind of like fast food joint, the customer servise she gave was 5 stars. She should show some local restorants servers how its done...Can't remember her name :-(    She made sure to welcome us with the kindest greetings. Explained menu to us in and out. Gave us samples to try...Amazing employee....Recommended few items on the menu while giving us a background/history of the Portbelly.   Food was amazing! I had a Mediterranean sandwich and my boyfriend had a phlly sandwich. We were both happy with how they turned out to be. She also gave us a cookie on the house as first timers...  For sure recommending this place and we are definitely going back when in need of a fast and yummy sandwich fix.

I keep going back to this place because I love their salad bowl; however, I hate how every time I go my salad gets smaller. Also, I do not like that they move so fast even if I am the only person in line...give me some time to be able to tell you what I want on my order without rushing me like there is no tomorrow.   The staff is friendly do not get me wrong, but they just need to chill a little....

Gave it another try and I am already regretting it!   They do not listen, they go 100 miles an hour....shredded lettuce is no sheared lettuce at all...Pieces are so not nicely chopped ...   Instead of chicken quesodilla my boyfriend got open quesodilla. He was not happy.   Please slow down - at least when it is not so busy and listen to your customer.

Very different approach on sandwiches and I like it.   I love the ingredients and all the different options that they have. It is fresh and yummy for sure.   Portions are perfect but not everybody would agree with me on that one. For me it is just right amount of food.   Service is great and atmosphere is nice. Location is awesome and I cant wait to go back again!

I just realized that this place is on yelp...   This café is located in my office building. I have been going to this café since they open. The owner "Ken" is amazing!!!!  He is so welcoming and as picky eater as I am, he is alway ready to fulfill my needs by making sure I get what I want.   This place is very cozy and welcoming and food is decent!   Did I mention that owner Ken will remember you and your name from day one. He takes a pride in his little café and puts whole family to work.   Everyone is so nice and if you are ever in the area I would recommend you swing by for a quick lunch or breakfast.

I was never much into shaved ice, but this place...let's just say I am addicted. I can't get enough.   The ambiance is great with a hip decore and nice art.  It has great location. The service is super good and fast.   I mostly order mango flavor with nutella. They have great selection of topings to choose from. Many different combos and trust me, you can not go wrong.   I am looking forward to my next visit....

Finally, the place I had on the list for such a long time and the place that is in my neighborhood made a cut.  I took my boyfriend here on 03/27/15 for his actual birthday for dinner as celebration was taking place next day.   As soon as we pulled in, i was impressed.   Super friendly hosts greeted us and escorted us to the table outside. Once I set down I felt I was somewhere in Europe, which brings me that much closer to home.   Our server showed up shortly as well. She was amazing. Since we were first timers, she made sure to tell us all about the restaurant and options that we had on the menu as well about the current specials they had.   We ordered, Curry mussels, Duck, Brussels sprouts, and Sweet potatoes. Everything was super delicious, especially Brussels sprouts. They were the bomb. If I could I would give them10 stars. Portions are small just FYI, but I personally like it that way.   The cocktails we ordered were super tasty as well.   After dinner, we chose to share complementary dessert and it was as delicious as   it looks on the picture below. With the dessert, we had some expresso that was also the bomb.   The birthday boy enjoyed every minute of it and I found my new favorite spot!

Just went for an Happy Hour for the first time.   It was a really nice atmosphere. I ordered their mussles with glass of house Pinot and I must say - it hit the spot.   I would like to go back for full service and then get back to you guys with more kosher review :-)

Let me say first that I am not into sushi at all....  It was my friend's birthday and she requested sushi for dinner. I looked up this place and it looked pretty good and since we wanted to stay locally in downtown it was perfect location.   We got there and place was so busy. The hostess was extremely helpful and made sure to get us a really nice table in timely manner.   Between 6 of us, we ordered so much food. So, I decided to give a sushi yet another try.  And I must say it was a success. I tried a lots of different kinds and it was all pretty good despite my lack of love for sushi.   Server was awesome as well. She was very present and helped us with all questions that we had. She made sure to check on us at all times and was really kind and funny at the same time!   Atmosphere was really good. We had a great time and I am for sure going back to the Squid Inc again. Maybe not for sushi but for drinks and ambiance for sure.

This place pulled me in because of the historical building that I absolutely love.   The ambiance inside is great. Interior design is amazing....I love the gothic but yet modern look. Chandeliers are beautiful...the fact that original windows were kept from the previous church is amazing. Décor is pretty awesome which helps the great atmosphere.   The food, I must say it was nothing special. I had better tacos for sure. I also thought they were little over-priced for the amount you get.   I would for sure go back to this place, but mostly because of atmosphere rather than food.

My first review on this place was not 5 stars but this time experience was for 10 stars.   It is true when people say service is as important as the food is.   Me and my boyfriend took his parents, grandparents and his brother for lunch. It was a first time for all of them   From the start everything was great.   We got really nice table and the best sever ever. Yes, his name is Eric.  Eric was exceptional. The best sever I came a cross in a long time.   Food was amazing, from appetizers to entrees, to drinks...etc.  Everybody was so happy with the choice. Grandparents enjoyed the ambiance and loved how the church was transformed and made into this nice restaurant.    Eric made sure we were taking care of at all times. No question we are going back, but calling ahead and making sure Eric is working if we have a bigger party again.   Thank you Eric! You are amazing!

There are no words to describe the love I have for this pizzeria.   It is as close as you will get to an authentic Italian food.   The atmosphere is absolutely amazing with Italian music playing in background. The smells inside are unexplainable. The smells of fresh oregano when you first walk in are a must experience....All of the staff is real friendly.   Every pizza that I have ordered and all of others entrées I tried, I was amazed every time. Everything is so fresh and in house made. Then if you are lucky, the owner will pour you his homemade lemon shot, which is purely amazing...They call it homemade limoncello. The owner is mostly there serving and cooking, which shows you how much love is put in the atmosphere and food of this little local Pizzeria.   They take reservations...I can't wait for my nest visit...

This place was recommended by a friend. Great recommendation indeed!  The atmosphere was great, it felt like I was out of town like in a real big city - if you know what I mean.   Service was outstanding. Our server was very friendly, always made sure to check in and at the same time gave us our space. Wonderfull!  Food, I had mussels and as picky i am with sea food - I would order them again for sure. We also shared a pretzel and it was great! Prices are reasnoble as well.    I am looking forward to a cooler weather outside to be able to seat on their beautiful patio.

How happy am I to have such a cool place in my neighborhood.   Great food, great service, great atmosphere....  Starbucks who? Coffee here is amazing and no plastic cups. You get a normal grown up ceramic coffee mug.   The only thing that is missing here is nice patio....

What a great experience!   Despite this being a fast food. I enjoyed it.   Customer service was great. Very friendly employees, great and clean atmosphere. I was impressed.   Food was good as well. I ordered a fruit salad instead of fries and it was actual fruit that tastes good. There were even blueberries in it.   I am not giving it a five stars just because it is still fast food chain.   Nice job chick- file :-)

Every time I go to this location I have an awful experience....  The wait to get drinks, food, or any kind of attention was just insane.   None of us enjoyed our food...Let's just say none of us wanted to take left overs home. I do not understand how can food taste so much better at Up Town location? People we are talking about food here, not atmosphere. Get it together Fillmore....  Even though I like atmosphare and vibe at this location better, I am  not sure if I ever want to go back. Too bad

I do not know about you guys but this is my favorite sushi place in town. I have been here plenty of times and have never been disappointed.  All the staff, including the owner of the place is super friendly! Every time I go there the owner makes sure to say hello to everybody and even comes by the table. Now, that is called amazing customer service.   Food is absolutely delicious! I usually like to start my meal with the Misho soup. They have a great twist on everything. Best edamame I've ever had. It comes seasoned which I love. I tried so many rolls and really can't pick the favorite one. However, I can recommend few...H3 roll, Sex and the city, Oh My God Roll, Oasis roll, etc.    The technique used to sear and flavor is really very nice. Also, they use purple rice !!! Anything you order of the menu, believe me, you will not regret it. And, do yourself a favor and get the fresh made real wasabi.  Atmosphere is super nice. It is such a welcoming place. Be sure if you go in a bigger group to call ahead for reservations, as they really get busy.  The only recommendation to the owner is, perhaps to play some Japanese music

The atmosphere in this place is awesome! I can't decide if I like it more inside with all fun local arts and owners timeline pics or outside, with a great view on a central avenue light rail....  We ordered pizza, wings and jalapenos mac-and-cheese. My favorite was mac-and-cheese. Pizza, I for sure had better but I would order pizza here again, no problem    Service was great. Our server checked on us many times, explained specials, filed our water in timely manner...loved it!  I would recommend this place for anyone to check out.

I am in love with this place!  For such a little place, who would of think it would be so much fun!  Every time we go, we have a blast.   They have great selection of wine and beer. Did I mention a great selection of grilled cheeses that they have? They are absolutely delish. Order up people.   The atmosphere is always awesome. People that work there are extremely friendly and have great knowledge of their products. You are never ignored at this place. Even if you went all by yourself, you would feel like you are in a company of so many friends!  They have several fun games all around so you are never bored at this place. Also, take an advantage of chalk wall and leave your prints.   I forgot to mention that this place has been most yelped place in the entire USA! Yes, entire USA. You must check it out and believe me, you will not regret it!

I am a big fan of the LGO and this new amazing place just proved again that this team definitely knows what they are doing.   The atmosphere at this new place is purely amazing!  Three of us went for the first time around dinner time. The Food was really amazing. In my opinion sizes are perfect; however, that is the only one thing me and my boyfriend disagreed on as he thought that portions are bit small....No surprise there...hahhaha  We ordered their popular chips and I do not know if I like chips or dip more! These amazing chips were Crispy, crunchy, and served with a lemony tazaki kind of dip (not sure what exactly it was but - it's super legit!) Ketchup who?     For dinner me and my friend ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had a Paris, Texas burger of course. I was lucky to try both as me and him split ours....Crispy chicken was amazing, the spicy aioli they use is out of this world. The chicken was crispy but yet nice and tender at the same time. I loved the apples and dill pickle combination in sandwich as well. Burger was good as well but I am not big on red meet so I am not as good judge on that. However, I can say my boyfriend liked it a lot.   The only thing I did not like is the fact that they served food and drinks in plastic ware. Food in plastic didn't bother me as much as drinks did. For example, the beer would have been fresher in a cold glass as opposed to a plastic cup. But perhaps that is just me....  Outside seating area is amazing....Overlooking Campbell avenue with beautiful lighting outside was great! Service was amazing as well. The fact that their chef came out and asked how the food was, is kind of place I would for sure go back too.   Everyone there was really nice and friendly and I will for sure go back!

We finally made it to The Henry!  Despite the long wait it was worth every minute.   We were greeted by a really nice hostess and she right away told us about the wait time as she told us to get a drink at the bar and make our self's comfortable in the waiting area. We did, and the time went by really fast.  The atmosphere was amazing.   The interior design was right in our back yard. Music was perfect and drinks from the bar were the bomb.   40 minutes later, we were escorted to our table on their patio area. It was perfect. The weather outside was perfect and atmosphere was divine.   My boyfriend ordered Roasted Turkey French Dip and I ordered Warm Salmon salad. We shared and we were both stoked. Every bite was so delicious. We did not want it to end. For drinks we ordered Upstate Gentleman and Old Fashion. Yummmm  We are going back for sure and would recommend this place to any of our friends. The only disappointment we had was the fact that we waited this long to go when it is so close to us.   Thanks to all "The Henry" staff!

I am a huge fan of all Upward Project restaurants.   Joyride is a new addition to my list.   I ordered in. The person over the phone was super nice and helpful, which made my ordering experience that much easier.   Picking up was a great experience as well. Fast, with great customer service. Food was nicely packed so when we got home, everything was kept fresh and temperature of food was excellent.   Food was delicious. I do not know what I was fan of more, enchiladas or tacos ;)  They have advised us that now they have a happy hour every Tuesday. We attempted twice already; however, the wait was petty long. We will keep trying as I would like to experience of dining in the restaurant.   It has perfect location. Parking is well situated.   I highly recommend it!

I went to this place on three separate occasions and every time it was a disappointment.   First two times, I could not even get the table and last time I went hostess was so unprofessional and rude. When 5 of us walked in she was talking to her friends that were leaving and would not even pay attention to us for good 3 minutes. Let me say that when she finally acknowledge us, she was really rude.   We walked in, place was dead. There were two people at the bar and that was it. I wouldn't of mind staying if the whole entrance experience was a bit nicer but we decided to go elsewhere.   This place is really nice inside but I it is hard for me to go back for fourth time and experience the same service.   I do not understand why do some people think they have a right to be so rude in positions that they are in. No offence, I was a hostess once but never would I treat my clients like that.   Hopefully I am wrong about this place and it was just my bad luck to have this kind of expiriance 3 times in the row.

I finally made it to this super nice place that many of my friends recommended.   It was exactly the way they described it if not even better.   I went to meet up with my friend and we were both first timers,   As soon as we entered premises, we were greeted by really friendly employee who worked at the bar area. She advised us that we can have a seat at any available table.   We agreed on the table inside. The place was so cozy and has such a nice atmosphere. Both of us being born and raised in Europe, this kind of place made as feel just like home. Our server even had European roots. Funny, ha?   He was super cool. Very welcoming and informative. He explained the menu, including the Happy Hour one. Also, he made sure to check on us during our entire stay.   We "obviously" ordered some wine and some of their extremely delicious starters.  Everything was great. Food was delicious and when it comes to wine, I never had  one I did not like :)   There is also patio outside and with beautiful Arizona weather, I can't think of a better way to go. Wine + Starters + Weather = Pure Happiness.   Parking will not be an issue either, considering it is semi-downtown location.

I don't even know where to begin!  Food, ambiance, service, atmosphere, everything was above and beyond.   We were shopping at the Union and decided to stay there for dinner. Place looked great but since we never tried their food we were not sure what to expect. And then...What an amazing surprise...  The food was absolutely amazing. I had tomato basil soup, which was amazing. Then for the main course I ordered Baby Octopus that was served with mashed potatoes, old bay aioli and breadcrumbs. It was out of this world. The portion was really small but you do not want plate of entire octopus on it...just saying.   My boyfriend had Mushroom pizza with house made sausage, garlic and thyme. He was as well blown away. I had to have a piece because it looked so good and I didn't want him to eat entire pizza by him self . The crust was awesome. It was tender but yet crispy throughout.  It was full of flavors. I had to pick sausages out as I do not eat pork but he said they were the bomb.   Drinks were to die for as well. We had Ways&Means (bourbon, sweet vermouth, 2 bitters, maple) and High Tide (gin, orange, lime, mint). They were very different from each other but flavors were amazing on both.   Service was just out of this world as well. Our server was really helpful by explaining the Menu, checking on us in timely manner and getting us exactly what we needed when we needed it.   This is a kind of a place that I will keep going back to. They have a beautiful fire pit outside, which is perfect to have a drink by on the semi-cold Phoenix nights.   Thank you unique but absolutely amazing Forge and crew, we will be coming back for sure!

Loved this place!  We went for Sunday mid-day Coffee.   The service was super nice. Our barrista was super nice and made an amazing coffee, that is not served in plastic cup (sorry Starbucks lovers).   The location is superb. Inside is super spacious and outside seating area is just as nice. It is not cluttered.   We only had coffee and some pastries and all of it was delicious. I was craving a lemon bar whole day and they didn't have one but it is kind of hard to top the lemon bars I make so it is better they didn't have any :-)   We are for sure going back to this place and we want check out their food.   Thank you Fame!

We went here for the first time to see what is the buzz all about.   As the first timers, my expectations were bit high. I was expecting better service in a sense to where they would explain to us how it works or if they had any recommendations. It was a complete opposite.   The girl that was helping us could care less about any questions we were asking, she was really unfriendly and just wanted to take our order and get to the next person. Did I mention, the place was not even that busy.   We seat outside and food arrived. Totally average burgers. In my personal opinion they are super average for the price. The buns are nothing special....I was not impressed at all.   Little over $30 later, bad service, and average food I did not leave this joint with the mindset of wanting to come back ASAP.

I was super excited when this place opened up, close to my work.   When it first opened, I went to get lunch and it was a just ok experience. However, I wanted to give them yet, another try.   This time, I ordered a caprese salad to go (NO ONIONS OR PROTEIN). When I got back to the office, as hungry as I was - I started digging right in to my salad. Boy was I in for a surprise.....  Not only that I got chicken and 2 pieces of some gross looking salami, I also got a whole pail of onions. Really???? Chicken, I was not to mad about as much as I did not care for it but onions.???? That is where the line was pushed. I wonder does is ever occurred to food industry people that we might have certain allergies.....?   The lettuce it-self was super chunky and in large pieces. Not appetizing at all. In the entire salad, I got 2 pieces of mozzarella cheese but they sure did not mind to hook me up with onions.   I was really, really disappointed. Yes, it is a cheap salad but still - this was a compete waste of my time and money. The salad ended up in garbage and I ended up eating banana and peanut butter that I had in the office for my afternoon snack. At least there were no onions on it ;-)   I do not think I will go back and if anybody asks me at work, I will tell them the truth about my two unsuccessful visits there. Did I mention there is over 400 employees in my office and I am chair of our Wellness Committee. I am sorry, I am going little to hard on Salad- to -Go but when you leave me hungry by messing up my order - trust me, you do not want to be around. How hard is it to mess up a salad, really?   For me, it does not matter if my lunch/dinner costs me $5 or $50, I will be picky and have decent amount of expectations. It is food and it should be handled properly.
