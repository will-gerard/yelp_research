If I could give it negative stars, I would. The only good thing about them is their price. They are also a pretty good size, but everything is cheap, broken, and poorly made. I guess if it's all you can afford and you don't mind sharing your home with hundreds (probably thousands) of roaches, then they aren't bad. We moved in almost a month ago, and have been begging management to do something about the roaches but all they do is spray on Wednesdays and that does nothing. We have sprayed and fogged and baited and nothing works. We kill between 30 and 50 a day/night. It's horrible! We even have bites from those nasty things..seriously, google it. I'm not walking back in that place besides to get my (probably roach infested) stuff out. Besides the roaches, their playground and gym and everything else is always closed. The pool is so chlorinated it burns your skin for days. And it's not the safest place to walk around at night. I would rather be poor in a decent place than try to save money at that hellhole. I could go on for days, but just ask yourself, do you really want to live in a place that doesn't care that they are completely infested with roaches. All the residents I talked to said their place was just as bad..am I the only one who can't live like that?!

Pete Vaca is amazing. I love my tattoo and this shop. He made me feel so comfortable! This will definitely be where I go from now on.

This place is great! First time there was with my fiance and son. My son had a donut, I had the fried bologna sandwich, and my fiance had the chorizo burrito. Everything was great! The sandwich took me right back to my childhood and the chorizo burrito was the best I have had. The following weekend I came back with my son and got the burrito and he had a donut. Again, everything was very good. The service is perfect, Bobby is friendly and remembered us from before. My fiance went for donuts with our son and now tells us he wants to go see Bobby and get donuts almost daily. The place is cute and clean and feels very relaxed. I'm glad we decided to stop in instead of go to Dunkin Donuts down the street. The only thing that would make this place better would be if there were iced and blended coffee choices. I see this being a fairly regular weekend spot for us. And I can't wait to go in for a homemade meatball sandwich!
