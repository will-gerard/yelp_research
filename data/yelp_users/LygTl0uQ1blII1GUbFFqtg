It started off kind of rough as I had a digital copy of a coupon that they said "needed to print" to honor. However, I liked the style of the shop, it was cute and clean. I loved the perfect match color option as I have struggled with many shops to find a match for my gel nails and regular polish for my toes...so that was a major plus. Also, KD was nice and the kept my appointment time. I think I'll be back soon :)

Very friendly and accommodating staff. Location is convenient and prices are reasonable. The shop is not the most upscale venue but clean and gets the job done. Steve and staff made sure I was satisfied and let me know that's what they are there for :)

Umm how can I put this in words...GROSS! I got the gyro and I could only stomach one bite! The sauce was absolutely not authentic, runny and nasty! Guess I should stick to Niro's Gyros!!

This place is always soooo good! I mean REAL barbecue and yes they smoke everything to perfection! Customer service is always great probably because the owner has a watchful eye on his staff lol. They are routinely on Groupon too! Even better...for the best BBQ in AZ

Dope! I had a Groupon for this place in my neighborhood and it really is a hidden gem! Super fast, clean, and my eyebrows haven't looked this good in a while! They offer other beauty service such as lashes and even brow extensions lol. Highly recommended! Go ladies!!
