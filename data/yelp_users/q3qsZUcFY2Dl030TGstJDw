I'm traveling internationally and needed help from a local agent in Chandler. I called several times and the agent (Tim, if I'm not mistaken) was an ass. Couldn't be bothered to hear me out and find a solution. Kept trying to send me to another store - get rid of me. Not the AVIS that I am used to. No customer service skills. "Help me find a solution. Don't become another problem."

Josh is my guy. Always straight talk about good news and bad news. Has proven himself to be someone I can trust and someone I can count on. Even when I'm traveling I can count on a family member to drop of a vehicle for service without getting hassled for unnecessary maintenance.   I have five vehicles that have been serviced at Greulich's over last five years. When Josh moved to the Gilbert store- I started bringing our vehicles over hear.

Best yogurt place in S. Chandler.  Tried Fresco and Golden Spoon, but neither compare to this.  Friendly service, bright open spaces, and clean everything.  Cost model is simple: get what you want (dozen different flavors, cone/cup, toppings, and fresh fruit on top) then it's $0.38/oz.  Hint: there's even free WiFi and a Mac for customers to surf online (or write their yelp review).  Shhhh...
