If Arizona is your destination, then most likely you'll be coming through this beautiful airport!  Though I can't comment on the parking as I came through here and opted for a rental, I have to say this airport is spacious though it doesn't look as busy as when I went through O'Hare.  If you're doing a rental, be sure when you collect your baggage, you exit the doors and take a roomy, air-conditioned shuttle for a 5-10 minute ride to the rental building which is a couple miles away from the airport but as I said, not too far.  Staff at the airport are friendly and always willing to help or answer a question if you have any.  There's ample signs on where to go for check in, luggage, or rental cars.  The airport is clean including the bathrooms.  WiFi is offered for free and the signal is really good.  My only gripe with the airport is the lack of eating/fast-food shops like Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, Burger King, etc. at least for the gates that I came in or departed from. (-1)  Definitely love this airport and looking forward to making it a part of my future travel plans!

Lots of parking to be found and not too crowded seeing as we went there during the middle of the day.  The food court was packed though but throughout the mall wasn't.  Lots of stores, e.g. Dillards, Sears, JC Penny, Macy's, Dick's, an Apple store, etc.  One thing I do like about this mall is that it's layout istn' confusing and you don't get lost easily.  It's on the small side of malls as I've seen and been to larger but small is good especially when you're looking for something particular. Definitely will be coming back here, not only to shop at the stores, but to try some of the restaurants in the food court which seemed to be popular.

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Glendale just in front of the mall.  For me it was a bit difficult to figure out the entrance from the street so I just entered by way of the mall entrance.   Parking is plentiful.   Place is clean both outside and in and well lit.   I found the place a bit small inside with the spacing between the seating a bit close seeing as I had to maneuver to get to the food bar.  I can imagine if the place is filled with people it might be difficult to move between the tables. (-1)  Menu - a party of 3 and we paid about $30 plus one in our party had a drink which was about $2.29 extra....not too bad.  Service - The staff was very friendly.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and pricing was explained especially the extra for drinks.    Food - It's buffet food and though it's not as extensive as some other buffets I've seen or encountered there was enough variety except maybe in the dessert department though I'm not going to minus points for that.   Rating - 4/5.

Decided to visit with the family and I have to say, my overall opinion is a bit disappointing. World Wildlife Zoo is located in Litchfield Park next to the Luke Air force base.  There's lots of parking which is free.  The zoo is large and it's about $32 for entry as an adult but we managed to snag a deal on Groupon which they happily honored and brought down the entry fee to about $23.   The zoo is large so be prepared to walk however one should consider bringing sneakers as it's mostly dirt roads so open-toed slippers isn't a good idea.  One should also spray themselves with bug spray before coming if you're planning on wearing shorts or sleeveless as there are some bugs around some of the animal pens. There are lots of exhibits however I found that around every corner was bird exhibits and this should be an aviary rather than a zoo as there's more bird exhibits than regular exhibits.  Some exhibits allow you to feed the animals however there aren't any antiseptic gel dispensers so one should walk with some Purrell hand sanitizer after you've fed the animals as it could get sloppy. Be sure to bring a backpack with water as I didn't find too many concession stands evenly spaced around the place selling drinks. Before leaving be sure to check out the aquarium to the left of the entrance.  I can easily see how it can be missed as there aren't too many glaring signs for it but it's worth it.  For me, I thought it was better than the regular zoo. Some of the enclosed exhibits, e.g. newborn smelled malodorous so be prepared to gag if you don't have a strong stomach.  I found that these particular areas could've been cleaned and aerated better for the public. Definitely not worth coming back to.

Updating this review as it most definitely deserves the three other stars I neglected to give it before. Visited the zoo during Christmastime and I have to say I was really impressed with the expansion projects, more exhibits, the safari exhibits they've opened, and the continual improvements they're making hoping to open more exhibits this year 2015!  As usual, the aquarium portion of the zoo which is must-see and must not be forgotten is a real treasure! This zoo is really much better than the Phoenix Zoo with lots to see, do, and participate in! I will definitely be returning again in 2015 to see some of the newer exhibits they hope to open this year.

Located in Surprise right behind the large U-Haul building just past the train tracks.   Great place to get your car washed!  Staff are friendly, answer any questions you have, and aren't pushy with offering you services that you don't need as I have seen in some of the surrounding car washes in the neighborhood. The place is clean and well lit. You pull up to one of the stations just as you enter on the right, then you tell them what you want.  The attendant will mark your choice on one of your windows with a removable crayon.  Then you wait a minute while he prints out a receipt, you them exit the vehicle, and take the receipt inside to pay at the cashier who is also friendly and smiling.   You can either opt to stay indoors where it's cool and have a look at your car going through the wash through the large glass windows or you can wait outside.   When your car exits, one of the many attendants outside will take it and wipe the vehicle off of any remaining water and will shine the tires too even on the $9.00 ultimate external wash only. I even sometimes tip the attendants working on the cars outside as it's hot and they really do an excellent job of getting it ready for you. Will be coming back many more times!!!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Peoria in a strip mall off Bell Road around the furniture store Tres Amigos.   Parking is horrible as Jamba Juice is situated next to the Panda Express and it seemed that the parking lot wasn't big enough.  I think it would pose a problem if you had a larger sized truck or SUV. (-1) Jamba Juice was small and on hot days like the day I visited, it was packed with barely enough seating to accommodate me or my party though you could opt to sit outside while you wait for your order but who wants to wait in 115 degree weather outside, right.  With it being so packed, inside can get a bit stuffy and even noisy with all their blenders going at full crunch!  I was raising my voice to the person behind the register just to place my order. (-1)  Menu - Very extensive and lots of options/choices, and well laid out that I didn't have any questions and very clear to see.    Service - Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Greeted us when we walked in even though the place was packed.  My order - I ordered the Caribbean Passion Smoothie which was supposed to contain passion fruit, mango juice, strawberries, orange sherbet, and peaches.  Staff informed me that they were out of peaches and asked if I'd like to substitute it with another option which I did with blueberries.   I have to say the drink was cold and smooth with no bits of fruits or didn't have that grainy feel to it with some smoothies I've had before.  There was some bits of leftover fruit in the bottom of it but not enough to deter from the overall taste.  I also have to mention that I didn't seem to taste any passion fruit, strawberries, or mango as the drink advertised.  I did definitely get the orange and blueberry taste and even saw that characteristic blueberry color so I'm not sure what quantities or concentrations of fruits are added.  Is it equal proportions of each fruit, I don't know. (-1)    I don't think I'll be returning here in future for my smoothie cravings as there are many other local businesses out there vying for my attention with their innovative smoothie creations that I'd like to give a chance to.

For our Sunday lunch we were in the mood for some Southern cooking and comfort food so we decided to give this place a try.   We came hungry and left happy!  Location & Aesthetics - located on S Central Ave in Phoenix.  It's a corner restaurant and wasn't difficult to miss with big enough signs.   The parking lot at the side of the restaurant was on the small side and packed.  Thankfully at the time of our arrival a couple of people were leaving so we got lucky to snag a parking spot.  There's a parking lot across a small street opposite the restaurant which I believe can be used to park as I saw other patrons parking there as well.  The restaurant had plenty of seating both inside, what looked like a back area, and an outside area though there weren't any folks dining outside due to the hot weather but the misters were on. The restaurant was clean and well lit from light from the outside and inside.   Noise levels was high with all the dining folks, and I believe there was music playing in the background.  Large screened TV's adorned the walls but were on mute.  The walls also contained paintings and pictures of various musicians and stars. My suggestion for an arrival time would be early.  We arrived at/around 1-1:30 in the afternoon and there was a wait of about 30 minutes plus the waiting area was packed with only standing room left. There's only one entry point into the restaurant from the parking lot and that would be on S Central Ave itself.  As you enter, you're greeted by staff then you provide them with your name and how many are in your party.   If you choose, you can wait around by the door as most people were doing if the one couch they have is occupied or wait outside as I also witnessed folks doing.  Menus - while you wait, you can grab a to-go menu (many copies available) to have a gander of what's on the menu as it was similar to the real one that's provided when you're finally seated. When you're seated, you're provided with a 4-page colorful, self-explanatory menu that also contained drinks and desserts as well (can't remember if I saw that on the to-go menu).    Service - All staff, from the folks that greeted us at the front door to our waitress, was super friendly.   The waitress explained everything and asked if we ever dined there before.  She provided suggestions of the favorite dishes that folks ordered and checked on us periodically throughout our stay.  Food - For me I ordered The Famous Soulfood Platter which came with your 1 choice from eight items plus two sides and it came with a cornbread.  From the 8 items, I chose the 3 pieces of chicken (Southern fried).  You can opt for random pieces or you can pick which ones you want.  For me, I went with the leg, a wing, and breast.  For my 2 sides, I chose the mac n' cheese and the rice with beans. The wifesky, ordered The Cool Bre Bre's Chicken Salad (field greens, white meat chicken, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes, avocado, applewood bacon & your choice of ranch, raspberry or balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing) and it was huge!  She almost didn't finish but she managed to push through. For my meal, first the sides - the mac n' cheese - served in a small bowl but was of a heaping portion and wasn't too dried out and sticky, and wasn't too runny either.  It was done just about right because you can't have mac n' cheese done too runny or too dried out in my opinion.   The rice with beans was to die for.  My only regret was not ordering another side of it.  The rice was well cooked and fresh plus the beans...not sure if it was red beans because it didn't look like baked beans was done to perfection!  It was well cooked and the sauce/gravy it was served in was nicely seasoned with a small kick to it. The chicken was moist, tender, succulent, fresh, and cooked perfectly.  It was well seasoned and the fried skin/batter wasn't overwhelming so it had enough bite/crunch to it.  The chicken wasn't too oily/greasy  It was truly Southern styled, comfort food!  Definitely would love to come back to try those oversized Belgium waffles I was seeing on other folks plates!  You truly won't regret your visit here!

Decided to give this place a try after seeing their television commercials.  Visited on a Friday evening and the place was packed though strangely enough by many seniors. Parking was troublesome and we had to find parking at an adjoining parking lot associated with business offices. Wait was about 20-25 minutes.  There was ample seating inside to wait but we chose to wait outside but sadly there was only 1 bench to sit on. Staff greeted us warmly.  Waitress was pleasant but never visited us throughout the meal to check up on us to see if the meal was satisfactory if I need a refill on my drink (Old Fashioned) (-1). Inside - tables were cleaned quickly, lighting was a dark, did notice when we were leaving there was food on the floor.  The restaurant can be a bit on the noisy as it was packed. Food was plentiful, very tasty, and very well seasoned.  Plates can be on the pricey side starting from the mid-teens to above $20-25.  Menu could be a little more varied in my opinion but definitely worth a revisit.

This mall is huge but it's really great!  It's got every conceivable store you can want or wish for though I didn't see an Apple store and a Potter Barn but that's not a big deal.  It's got favorites like Mont Blanc and an Omega watch store.  It's got it's customary big name department stores, e.g. Macy's, Dillards, and Niemann Marcus.  For me, it's not too far to visit from the West Valley, it was about 30 minutes which I don't think is bad at all.  I also believe the mall has a movie theater as well as I saw a sign for it but I'm not sure.  There's a large food court in the center of the mall so you're not without your food or a quick snack.  Parking can be somewhat of a hassle to find but there is an enclosed parking garage where you can find ample parking and easy walkway access directly into the mall.  There's lots of places to sit and take a break from the endless walking/shopping etc. and I didn't find that the mall was filled with the excessive number of loitering teenagers as I've discovered at other malls.  Definitely high-end and high-scale and I love it.  Will be visiting here many more times to come!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Peoria opposite from the Peoria Sports Complex and nestled between the Cheesecake Factory and The Elephant Bar.   Parking is plentiful.   The restaurant is clean, very spacious, and well lit.   Menu - 3 was brought to the table - drinks, main, and lunch menu all easy to understand.  Service - Staff was super friendly and helped answer any questions we had.    Food - I ordered The Big Slab with Wilbur beans, creamy coleslaw which comes with a corn bread muffin.   Creamy coleslaw was indeed creamy and fresh.  It wasn't watery or warm.  The Wilbur beans had a little kick to it but not too much and was well seasoned and just the right temperature. The ribs was tender and juicy with lots of ample sauce.  It wasn't too tender where it was falling off the bone but well cooked and well smoked as well.  It tasted as if it had been smoked for some time as that flavor was down to the bone!  Will most definitely be returning to try many of their other items on the menu and to also try their to-go service!

Thought I'd give this location a try from the one I usually go to in Surprise but I have to say it's even worse. Despite it being a little more spacious than the one in Surprise, the eating area wasn't well cleaned by staff with food on the tables and floor (-1) The food in our orders looked as if it was tossed up in the air as it was all on one side of the bowl (-1) The food contained numerous bits of burnt ingredients (-1) The portion sizes was lacking in comparison to other locations and there was little of everything like rice, etc (-1) Guess I'll have to look for another alternative location.

As I'm from the East coast, I thought I'd give this place a try to see what their philly cheese steak sandwiches were like.  Was I disappointed or not?  Location & Aesthetics - located on N Alma School Road in Chandler and was very easy to locate with their signage.   Lots of available parking.  Parking lot is shared with other surrounding businesses but was big enough with plenty of spaces. Seating was only available indoors (no outdoor dining) with smaller tables and chairs toward the front of the restaurant for small parties, and large tables and chairs toward the back for larger parties.  The restaurant is on the small side though (-0.5). Unfortunately I did notice some of the tables, including ours, wasn't cleaned thoroughly and the floor had a sticky residue on it possibly indicating someone spilled soda prior (-0.5).  Menus - posted on a board above on the wall, and easy to read and comprehend.    Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming, including being greeted when we walked in, to also being asked how the food was when we were leaving.   Answered any questions we had about menu items, and even made suggestions which was welcomed by some in our party. I read from previous reviews that their bread can run out so I called ahead and asked about this.  The owner, I believe whom I spoke with, said it was true as they only have a certain number of bread on hand for the day.  He further explained, when it runs out, it's not like they can call the local bakery for more as they'll be closed.  He offered, by phone, to save a number of bread for me corresponding to the number of folks I was bringing which was really kind of him and was really appreciated.  Food - For me, I had the Original "Philly" Cheese Steak sandwich - 8'' (also comes in 12'') - layers of wafer thin steak, grilled with sautéed onions, their special red sauce, served on soft Italian steak roll, and made it a meal with their seasoned fries and a drink. Steak was cooked to perfection on their grills, and I like the fact that it's wafer thin (not chunky) as it allows for more to be packed into the bread.  Steak wasn't over oily/greasy, and even with their red sauce, it didn't make the bread soggy.   I think that's a huge mistake and oversight when creating a philly cheese steak sandwich - is giving the customer a soggy sandwich.  Who wants that? I can't remember what their red sauce consisted of, but when I inquired, was told that it gave the sandwich flavor - like a condiment, and it wasn't spicy at all but very tasty and flavorful. Onions were sautéed perfectly and wasn't overcooked or burnt.   The Italian bread roll was neither too hard nor too soft, but felt and tasted like it actually just came out of the oven - it tasted fresh! I expected the seasoned fries to taste seasoned as if it was supposed to have salt and pepper in it, but it looked like ordinary wedged shaped fries.  It still tasted good but it wasn't different in my opinion.  This place is a bit of a drive for me, coming from the West side of the valley, but I would definitely recommend if you're looking for an authentic philly cheese steak sandwich.  It definitely reminded me of what I've had back on the East coast.

I heard tons of positive reviews on this restaurant particularly their famous 'Switch burger' so I thought I'd give them a try.  Location & Aesthetics - Located in Phoenix and on my initial drive to the restaurant I sadly missed it even though the GPS said we had reached.  The facade of the restaurant looks unassuming and, in my opinion, the signage could've been a little better.   When I turned around, I didn't miss it the second time.  Apparently parking is in the rear and you can also choose to enter in the rear or in the front.  To me it was easier to enter in the rear as I parked there. Lots of parking when we arrived which was around 1630-1700 for dinner.  Our initial thoughts was we were going to be the only ones there as the parking lot was empty.  My advice, if you're going for dinner, get there early because as we were leaving, the parking lot was full with no spots left.  In fact, when we pulled out, another potential customer took our spot immediately. The restaurant itself is snazzy, chic, superbly clean, uncluttered, lots of space between tables/chairs, and well decorated.  One can chose to sit outside with what looked like comfortable chairs and tables, and even fans attached to the wall to keep folks cool.  We chose to sit inside where the A/C was on but wasn't blasting, just comfortable enough.  Menu - Well laid out, self-explanatory, and wasn't overwhelmingly 2-5 pages/leafs long.  Service - The staff was really nice, friendly, warm, welcoming, and accommodating.  Any questions (about the menu) were answered promptly.  Our waitress checked on us several times throughout the meal to ask if everything was good, asked about drinks/refills, and asked about our appetizers.    Food - For my drink, I ordered the sweet tea vodka lemonade which was positively addicting!  I wanted more but since I was the designated driver, one was where I drew the line. For appetizers we ordered the onion rings.  Initially we were told it was just going to be around 8 but instead was greeted with much more plus given 2 dips - ketchup and another whose name eludes me now.  The onion rings was hot, fresh, crunchy and very tasty with not too much batter surrounding the onion itself (not overly fried). For the main course, I ordered the 'Switch House Burger' which was out of this world.  The beef was well seasoned and cooked to perfection, mouth watering, and juicy, and cooked exactly how I asked -- medium-to-well done.  Many of the ingredients it contained balanced each other out, e.g., the tartness from the goat cheese was balanced by the Switch fig dressing; and the zesty taste of the Arugula was balanced out by the onion strings....everything was perfect!  The only reason they lost a star was because toward the end of the meal, we felt rushed as the waitress asked if we wanted to order any dessert, we declined, and immediately presented with us with the check.  Not a big deal in my book but the gesture was noticed by another in my party.  This place really some nice looking tasting items on their menu and, for me, it's definitely worth coming back to try some of them.

This place reminds me of Panera Bread from back east!    Location & Aesthetics - Located at Litchfield and Bell in Surprise.   Lots of parking space and the restaurant is spacious, clean and well lit.  Noise level isn't too bad.  Menu - very extensive and spans about three walls.  What's nice is the soup menu is clear and separate from the others, e.g. salad, drinks, entrees.  They're all on separate menus.  Service - Staff was super friendly, helpful and answered any questions we had.      Food - I ordered along with my party, ordered the Pick 2.  I had the newly released flatbread - Thai Chicken with the bowl of salad and the Strawberry with Ginseng smoothie. The flatbread reminded me of a taco and one in my party said it reminded them of a Naan bread.  It was well toasted and filled with lots of chicken and other stuff and there was that definite Thai taste of mixed sweet, tangy, spicy taste and it wasn't even that spicy might I add.  The bowl of salad - the strawberry, poppy seed was very taste with all fresh vegetables and fruit....very crunchy!  The salad dressing was a hint and wasn't overwhelming! The strawberry with ginseng smoothie was low salt so you don't get that sugar high yet it was still smooth and very cold!  Very tasty.  The meal comes with a complimentary cookie and despite not liking the one I was already given - chocolate chip, I was given one that I preferred - oatmeal raisin that was free!  Will most definitely be returning to try many of their other items on the menu and to also try their to-go service!

I've never had Greek food before and thought I'd give this place a try....  Location & Aesthetics - located on E. Indian School Road and not difficult to miss with their large signage out front. This place reminds me, in terms of their layout, of The Stand - similar in terms of seating, the interior, and drive through. Parking is available alongside the restaurant and also available toward the rear.  There is no parking on the side of the drive through as it's a bit of a squeeze there. Lots of room and seating inside, and there's also seating outside, though I didn't see any misters in operation! The restaurant was well lit with all of their tables and chairs clean. Noise level wasn't bad with two TV's on, on either side of the restaurant, in the corner ceiling.  Menus - located above the check out.  It's not as detailed as what's on their website, however the cashier, who also takes your order, was available for any questions.  Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  We were greeted when we came in. Staff answered any questions we had about the menu, and even made recommendations which was much appreciated. When you're ordering to dine in, staff (very friendly) will bring your food to you and ask if there's any thing else you need.  Food - I had the Gyro Platter for $10.95 which entailed seasoned beef and lamb cooked and sliced off a rotisserie, and it comes with pita bread (about 5-6 triangles); also served with rice, Greek salad, and roasted lemon potatoes.  I have to say, for $10.95, do they give you a lot of food, so much so, that I couldn't eat it all and left the rest for dinner. Rice was well seasoned and cooked well.   The Greek salad was fresh and contained lots of fresh Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, bell peppers, Feta cheese (not too much to overpower the salad but seemed the right proportion), and olive, and two sides of Greek dressing. The beef and lamb were seasoned perfectly though appeared somewhat on the dry side (-1).  My perception of gyro was that the meat was supposed to be moist as it cooks on the rotisserie but I could be wrong.  Overall, I would recommend this place, and myself, would love to return to sample their other dishes like their pita combos, salads, and some of their interestingly named Greek platters!

Decided to try some take-out today for lunch.  Called ahead and was told the food would be 10 minutes and sure enough when I got there it was ready. The restaurant looked nice enough to even stay and eat but I didn't have time to do so. Ordered the Mongolian beef which came with a side of fried rice, a crab rangoon, egg roll, and soup of the day (chose the chicken).  For the price, it wasn't bad in terms of the portion sizes. Crab rangoon was fresh.  The egg roll was crispy and tasty.  I wasn't impressed with the Mongolian beef as compared to some of the photos I've seen on Yelp.  Beef was well cooked and despite asking for it to me mildly spicy, it wasn't even close, and there barely was any greens. The rice appeared overcooked and was very brown as compared to the color of fried rice I've had at other places before (-1). Will probably give them another try to sample other items from their extensive menu including the lunch menu.

Came here for the July 4th 2014 fireworks and I have to say this place is huge.  I didn't actually go into the stadium but the parking lot was large and there were plentiful grassy areas to sit with friends and family for the fireworks.  There was even a small lake that allowed fishing with a valid permit.  Even at night, it was well lit!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Peoria on the corner a somewhat large intersection though it stands apart from other stores within that area such as the JC Penny Home Store.  Therefore with that being said, be careful when you take the entrance for the JC Penny Home Store thinking you'll get to In-N-Out Burger because the restaurant has its own entrance and exit.   There's tables and chairs outside for dining purposes with misters if that's your thing or you can dine inside though when we went, inside was a bit crowded as it was a Friday night.  The restaurant was clean and there's always staff going around cleaning up the floors and tables.  Some in my party thought the place had a 50's look to it reminiscent of Freddy's Frozen Custard but I didn't get that feeling.   Parking can be a little difficult to find on a busy night like Friday as parking is somewhat limited to their parking lot which seemed small in size.  If you're doing the drive-through be prepared for a long line as we witnessed. (-1)  Menu - The menu is very simple - double double, cheeseburger, or hamburger.  Then there's fries, shakes, or beverages.  I have to say that I am really a fan of this concept of simple menus!  With that being said, we still had to step aside as there was one in my party who couldn't decide what they wanted.    Service - The staff was spectacularly nice and friendly!    Food - I ordered the double-double meal and substituted my drink for a strawberry shake. The burger was divine!  Juicy and mouthwatering with fresh lettuce, tomato, and of course American cheese which was dripping over the sides...my oh my oh my!  The french fries was fresh and lightly salted and tastes as if they just went out and picked the spuds, cut it up and put it right in the fryer!  The shake tasted like it was from real ice-cream - creamy and smooth, and most of which was consumed by someone in my party who, once they got a taste of it, couldn't put it down.  Suffice it to say, I was only left with a quarter of it to drink despite repeatedly offering to buy them one...that's how good the shake was!  Definitely will be coming back here for more!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in same lot with Big Lots and just opposite the hospital in Surprise.  Forgive me for the lack of directions as I'm new to the area.   Lots of parking available and this Starbucks offers a drive through.  If you wish to have your beverage outside, there's lots of seating and tables along with the misters for that cool feeing. The inside is clean including the bathrooms!  There's lots of space available to sit and charge one's devices!  This place fills up quickly with the elderly crowd and seating can become an issue but every time I've been there, I've always been able to grab a table and chair for myself.  Menu - it's a Starbucks and as usual, it's laid out in front of you above the cashier.  Service - The staff was very super-friendly.  Whether you're a regular or not, you're greeted immediately as you walk into the door. One thing that needs to be mentioned is the reliable WiFi here.  It's robust just like the coffee and never drops which is always best if you're there to work on that laptop or iPad!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Chandler on a road that seems to be the main drag with lots of other businesses, fast-food restaurants and other places to eat.     Parking is a bit limited as the restaurant shares parking spaces with other businesses  in the same mini-strip mall but when we went, there was plenty of parking available.  .   The restaurant is clean and well lit though a bit on the noisy side with the reggae music (-1).  Bathroom was clean.   Menu - The menu is posted on the wall at the counter behind the cash register and is not confusing to read however one thing I didnt understand was how it showed each dish and the accompanying day that it will be served, e.g. oxtail on Wednesday's (don't quote me on that as that's just an example) so I had to ask the lady if I could still get the curry goat on Saturday which she said yes to.  Service - The staff (one lady behind the counter) was very friendly and answered any questions we had. One thing we didn't like was a couple things - out in the dining area was no access to napkins or plastic forks, knives, spoons, etc.  If you're dining in, you are provided with a couple napkins and a plastic fork but I would like the freedom of choosing what plastic utensils I'd like to eat with and also I'd like the freedom to choose extra napkins if I so desire. (-1) The second thing is, one could not bring in your own beverages to be consumed from the outside.  We brought in our own water bottles and couldn't consume it because of the sign stating this policy.  Some people do prefer to consume water rather than the beverages offered on the premises and from my recollection, I don't recall water being offered for sale. (-1)   Food - I ordered the number the curry goat with rice and beans and plantains.  When you place an order, you are offered the option of white rice or rice and beans; and vegetables or plantains.   I was a little disappointed when I saw that my plate only had 3 plantains as I was expecting a bit more. The rice and beans was very bland and dry with no moisture and lacked any kind of seasoning or salt.  I would've put some extra salt on it but the dining tables lacked salt shakers. The curry goat lacked any kind of meat and was very small in size though it was hot and spicy as it should be. (-1)  I was really hoping that this place would've been my go-to place for Caribbean food whenever the hankering hit but unfortunately I cannot recommend this place.  I have eaten at many other Caribbean establishments and sadly this place just isn't up to par with them.

We decided to try this place based on the recommendation of a friend as we were in town on business.  Location & Aesthetics - Located in Glendale off the 101 highway on W. Coyote Blvd.  The restaurant is nestled among other restaurants and there's plenty of signs for it.  You can dine inside or outside if you desire.  If dining outside, there's mister's when it's hot outside.   There's lots of parking but it's not close to the restaurant.  There's small streets between the various restaurants and whatever parking spots they have usually full up quickly.  The restaurant is large and immediately when entering, you're not only greeted by staff but in front of you are large screened TV's and a huge center bar with plenty of lights. The place can get a bit noisy as we found it but it wasn't bad that we couldn't hear each other.  Menu - Their menu is large and can be intimidating as the first couple pages is reserved for their large variety of beer.  Seeing as we were new in town, we just wanted to try a softer drink and had to ask the waiter where those can be found on the menu.  The rest of the menu is straightforward and clear.    Service - The staff was very friendly!  Food - I ordered the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The beans tasted as they were just picked and they were verdantly green and crunchy and lighted buttered.  The mashed potatoes was equally tasty and delicious.  The ribeye was done just the way I asked and was soft, tender, well seasoned, and juicy.  I did however find that the food portions were on the small side (-1)  Rating - 4/5.  Definitely will worth coming back for the ambiance, atmosphere, their large variety of beer, and to try other items on the menu!

Where does this place get their fish from?  Is there a dock out back?  Read my review for more....  Location & Aesthetics - located on corner of N 59th Ave & W Union Hills Drive, in the same compound as CVS Pharmacy.  In fact, the restaurant is right behind it, and isn't difficult to miss, with good signage. There's lots of parking in the surrounding parking lots though not too many directly in front of the restaurant as the restaurant does share parking (in front) with other businesses.   Lots of seating within the restaurant and outside though I didn't notice the presence of misters for folks sitting outside. The restaurant was very clean -- floors and tables.  Adequate light from outside.  Music levels weren't too loud and there were two flat-screened TV's tuned to sports channels which was muted.  Menus - located above the cashier, where your order is also placed.  Very easy to read and comprehend.  Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  We were greeted when we came in. Staff answered any questions we had about the menu, and even made recommendations which was much appreciated. When you're ordering to dine in, staff (very friendly) will bring your food to you and ask if there's any sauces or extra condiments you'd like (a variety of condiments available on the table too).  Food - I had the broiled Atlantic salmon which came with "fresh vegetable medley" and "homemade seafood pasta salad". First off, the fresh vegetable medley was actually steamed vegetables and they were very fresh, not soggy at all, but very crunchy and served hot! The seafood pasta salad really tasted like it was homemade -- lots pasta, shrimp, and pieces of lobster meat with green beans, and served slightly chilled as it should be! The Atlantic salon was fresh like it was just caught, brought in from the dock, cleaned, and immediately placed in whatever apparatus you use for broiling stuff -- a broiler?  It was served hot, well seasoned (not over/under seasoned), soft, tender, and moist, not dry.  When cutting into it, it wasn't breaking apart on the fork which I think fish should being consumed, but that's me. Truly a savory dish!!!  If you check in with your Yelp app, there's 10% off your order so be sure to check in! I like that fact that they have all-you-can-eat fish-days.  I believe it's on Sunday (catfish) and everyday (tilapia) which is something I'm highly interested in. I most definitely will be back to eat here.  I can't say how much I loved the broiled dish I had today, and would love to try other broiled options like the Mahi Mahi or Pacific cod, and many others on their menu. I'll also like to return to sample their many and varied fried dishes on the menu.

Great tacos and burritos!  Visiting the restaurant in Goodyear.  Lots of parking space available with available outdoor seating.  Restaurant was spacious and well lit.  Staff were friendly.  Service was prompt.  Food was fresh and tasty.  Loved their sauce bar where you can help yourself to their various hot sauces.  Particularly like the variety in the menu with fish options!  Definitely will be back to try it all.

I had a hankering for some fried and thought I'd give this place a try based on many of the positive reviews from my fellow Yelp community.   After trying it, I have to say there isn't one ounce of regret in doing so....read on.  Location & Aesthetics - Located in in Phoenix on Bethany Road opposite the Phoenix Baptist Hospital. The restaurant isn't difficult to miss with their large sign but the street can be busy with traffic behind you so it's not easy to slow down and you can miss it if you don't know where it is.  Thankfully my trusty phone GPS pinpointed the exact spot. Parking can be somewhat difficult as the parking spots are limited and whatever are available are shared with other businesses.   There is a small street parallel to Bethany Road that must be used to access the restaurant and some of the other businesses and I believe one can park there as I saw a customer parking there but don't quote me on this.   The restaurant itself is a bit dimly lit but there are large windows in front that provide light.  The restaurant is a bit old too and could probably use a sprucing up in redecoration as some of the ceiling tiles had prior leak spots/stains.  The restaurant itself, most importantly, was very clean.    Menu - Clearly visible but not above or behind the cashier/order/checkout area but rather to the left on the wall.  Clear and concise.     Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  Any questions were answered promptly.      Food - I had the whiting and my wife had the catfish.  Mind you, I have never had or tasted these two particular types of fish.  The side I had with mine was the fried okra (yet another item I've never had) and my wife had the coleslaw. The fish was well fried with not too much batter and very well seasoned.  It was soft and tender and didn't have any briny taste to it.  This opinion applied to both the whiting and the catfish. The fried okra was the perfect combination of batter and okra.  I was able to easily break it apart and see the okra which was well cooked and none of the slimy was evident from the okra itself. Another thing to note is the 2-piece plate does come with 3 pieces of shrimp (fried) which was very tasty and delicious, and a drink.    Despite never had whiting and catfish in my life, I have to say that I'm now hooked on it and since I left, I've been craving on returning to this restaurant to have more!

So instead of the regular Friday Papa Johns pizza for dinner, we decided to give this place a try!  Location & Aesthetics - located on W Greenway Road by the corner of N Reems and W Greenway by the Walmart Neighborhood Market. Parking was a bit difficult to find as the parking lot is shared with part of Walmart Neighborhood Market, and it was a Friday evening.  The restaurant was clean on the outside and inside.  The restaurant (eating area) itself is spacious however the area where you order at the checkout immediately upon entering is a bit limited in terms of space. As we entered, there was a lot of people waiting around - some waiting for their orders that was placed, some picking up their orders, some who can't decide what to order and are looking at the menu, some in line, and some who can't decide what place they are in line. There is a three-seater bench/chair with two extra single chairs placed in the waiting area in case you wish to sit and wait for your order which nobody was really taking advantage of. The place was hopping which ought to tell you something!  Menus - the menu was self-explanatory and up on the wall.  Very easy to read.  Plus there are copies of the menu on the counter top in case you want to grab one and have a more in-depth perusal.  Service - We were there to place an order to go as when we attempted to call prior to place the order, we encountered an error message on the phone.  Thankfully there were 3 cashiers on deck trying to whittle down the crowd milling around at the checkout/cashier area, and they were working fast and efficient to take orders.  Despite the craziness of it being a Friday evening, they were very friendly, patient, and answered any questions we had. I asked about the phone situation and was told that on Friday's, their phones can get busy as they have 5 lines and they do get filled up quickly so it's best to keep trying and hope that you get through. The cashier even offered us water while we waited for our order!  Food - We order the large chicken supreme (Chicken, Mushrooms, Green Peppers, Onions, Mozzarella & Cheddar Cheese) with a side of 12 wings.   With the 12 wings, you can't mix-and-match however with the 24 wings you can which was no biggie.  The 12 wings was ordered as mild but still had a little kick to it which again wasn't a problem for me.  The wings were hot, juicy, well seasoned, flavorful, and very tender (not too tough) to work off the bone.  You do have a choice of original (bone) or boneless. The pizza pie was heavenly!  The pie was piping hot and pulling it apart, one can see the beautiful strings of cheese attempting to hold itself to the pie. The crust/dough was soft, buttery and moist, and not very dry.  The pie had lots of cheese, and adequate and equal amounts of ingredients on each slice.  The chicken was well seasoned, soft and tender.  The ingredients like the green peppers, onions, and mushrooms tasted fresh!  I think I've found our new go-to place to order pizza from now!  Absolutely love the food and their service!

If you're looking for a great tasting burger, then this is the place to stop into!   Conveniently located in Surprise with lots of parking.  Restaurant was clean except for some tabletops and small in my opinion (-1).  Staff are welcoming and friendly.  Service is fast. Menu is extensive so take a while to decide what you want! Their burgers are great - tasty, filling, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  They even butter the outside of the bread which makes it even more tastier.  Fries are good - fresh and hot. Their concrete mixers it would seem is their specialty with about 19 flavors from what I counted.  I wouldn't compare it to DQ's Blizzard but it's right up there and it's really tasty. Definitely will be coming back here to try some of the other varieties on the menu including other concrete mixer drinks....so addicting!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Tempe off E Guadalupe Road next to Albertsons on the end in the corner of the strip mall. Lots of available parking.  The restaurant was clean including the bathroom facilities.  The place was well lit though a bit on the cold side from the air conditioning.   The tables were clean as well.  Menu - Clearly visible above the checkout on a large blackboard written in chalk and pretty much self-explanatory.    Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  They answered any questions we had regarding the menu.   The place was surprisingly empty for dinnertime on a Saturday.  When we arrived there was only one patron eating and another who came in to pick up his order.  After washing up, I came out and discovered we were the only ones there for the entire time and we spent about 45-60 minutes there. No servers but the guy who took our orders at checkout brought out our food to the table.  Food - I had pork ribs with a side of BBQ beans and plate came also with a side of cornbread.  I have to say I really wasn't that much impressed with either the sides or the pork ribs. The pork ribs should be tasted enough on its own without having to douse with some of Andrew Original BBQ sauce which was by the way very tasty. The BBQ baked beans wasn't quite seasoned enough or provided that kick I was looking for.  The pork ribs wasn't hot and didn't feel as if it just came out of the smoker but cooked much earlier in the day (remember, we were there around 1700-1800 for dinner), and the meat didn't really slide off the bone as I expected.  It wasn't juicy, tender or soft. The cornbread was too moist and wasn't tasty but had a rather bland taste to it.  (-3 on ribs, and two sides)  Can't say I'll be back....

Review is for the Luke Air Force Base Air Show on April 2-3, 2016  Parking/Getting to the base - located at the corner of Litchfield & Olive in the large open spaced area.  There is another designated parking lot which also serves as handicapped as well but I'm not sure where that one was located.  Be prepared for lots of dust!   A suggestion would be to leave very early as we left closer to the time the air show started, and it was standstill traffic practically the entire way down to the base via Litchfield, despite police directing traffic which wasn't much help. Also, do keep note of your parking aisle because that'll be important when returning for your vehicle as the aisles aren't marked. After parking, be prepared for a security check point - wand, and all pockets emptied, all bags checks - this is only understandable and obvious. After the security check point, there are school buses available to bring you to the base.  Admission - free.  Food - not free.  Bring cash as I don't believe they were equipped to take credit cards although I can't speak for all vendors.  Lots of other vendors selling snacks, alcoholic drinks, souvenirs, toys for the kids, and I believe I saw umbrellas for the shade and seats to catch the show being sold.  What you'll see - Lots of planes to see - A-26, B-1, B-17, C-17, C-45, C-47, EF-18, F-15, F-35, F-16, KC-135, T-33, T-38, T-6, and the TMB Avenger.  Lots of aerial shows and performances - United States Air Force Thunderbirds, U.S. Army Golden Knights, F-35 Heritage Flight Team, Tora Tora Tora, Acemaker (T-33), Red Bull Demonstration Team, Jack Link's Screaming' Sasquatch, Alabama Boys. Lots of Luke Air Base personnel to chat with including veterans from various wars.  Lines to see the cockpit of some of these planes were long but they well worth it for me. You might want to bring sunglasses, sunscreen, a hat, nose/mouth protection if you're sensitive to the dust, lots of water, a seat and umbrella, and ear protection for the kids.  Returning/leaving - be prepared for long lines, to wait for the buses, on your way back to the parking lots.  You may not want to leave exactly at or toward the end of the show if you're in a hurry to get somewhere because of these long lines.  Is it worth it - you bet your sweet bippy it is!  Despite the traffic to get to the show, and the long lines to leave, as an aviation enthusiast and student pilot, this air show was definitely worth it and I will be back when it's next held.

Visit today to replace my router which broke the night before.  This is visit 2 of 2.  The first time I visited last evening, I forgot to check in.  What can I say about this Apple Store?   This Apple Store is no different from any of the other stores except maybe it could be a little more wider/spacious but they're located in the mall and every inch of space is valuable. Upon entering, on my first visit last evening as the store was practically empty, I was greeted as I entered; however, on today's visit, no greeting but they were busy and packed.  My only gripe with that is if you have someone that's supposed to be at the door greeting folks, then shouldn't that person be there doing their job? (-1) Customer service - on my first visit, it took me 1-2 minutes to get help and be helped.  Most of the employees were just milling about in cliques idly talking amongst themselves (-1).  Even trying to make eye contact with them proved to be futile.  Suffice it to say, I was eventually noticed and helped.  From then on, the customer service experience went smoothly.   On my second visit today, I encountered the same thing - difficulty trying to find someone to help me despite seeing many employees idly doing nothing with lots of time on their hands (had to exchange the item as I erroneously purchased the wrong item last evening).  I then courageously stopped an employee who wasn't doing anything and pretended to look busy using his employee iPad.  I told him what I was here for, he asked my name, and said I had to wait to be called.  I couldn't fathom why I had to wait to exchange an item which would only take a couple of minutes if so much!  (-1)  I waited and someone who was helping another customer in the vicinity of the item I wanted to buy saw me and immediately helped. Also, take note of this - if you're here to purchase something, be sure to tell them where you're working (guess, it's a little known secret as the employees are supposed to ask) to see if you're eligible for a discount - 20%.  The employee whom I was working with told me they're supposed to ask customers this but not everyone does. I wouldn't mind coming back here again only because I'm an Apple person fully embedded in the Apple ecosystem but their customer service really has much to be desired and needs lots of improviement!

Heard if you were in the area and was looking for a great buffet, this was the place!  Location & Aesthetics - Located in Scottsdale off the 101 highway, next to a mountain whose name I don't know, this place has got lots of free parking and a parking garage too that's free and is a part of the casino.   If you're unfamiliar with the casino it can be a little difficult to find the restaurant like I did as I didn't come for the casino so I had to stop and ask someone in the for directions.  Apparently I had to walk through the cigarette-smoke filled casino before getting to the buffet (-1 for lack of signs for the place) The restaurant buffet itself is large and well lit with large windows that gives you a view of the outside, letting lots of sun in.  It's very clean  Menu - The buffet offers a large, and I mean a large, variety of food, more than I have ever seen at other buffets.  The price wasn't bad for two people, we ended paying around $30-32 for lunch.  Service - The staff was very friendly and immediately greeted me as I entered the restaurant.  There was even a waiter around who immediately greets you after you've paid and chose a seat.  He'll ask what drinks you want and comes around frequently to ask if everything is okay.  Even toward the end of the meal, he'll ask if the dessert is okay and offer coffee.  Rating - 4/5.  Definitely will be coming back here to try their crab legs which I've heard and read lots of from the Yelp community!

There's no question about it, the buffet food here is phenomenal and top notch. Lots of variety, fresh, colorful, tasty, everything to please the most discerning or picky palates.  The atmosphere is great except maybe for the smoky smell from the casino but that usually doesn't bother me.  Waitstaff are always available and friendly.  If you want top notch buffet food at a great price (about $15/person), then this is place to come!

One of the reasons I love coming here is because of the Wandering Horse restaurant where you can find great buffet food for a great price.   Parking is free and there's covered parking.  The hotel looks huge and perhaps one day I'll rent a room to see what its like to stay there.  There's a huge pool that looks like fun with cabanas around the pool area which is another impetus to come here one day. Staff are friendly from the ones I've stopped to ask for directions to the restaurant. Really a great looking place with a great restaurant!

I came here for my own personal Man versus Food challenge to see if I can best the Torta Del Rey.   Read more to find out who won - was it Man, or was it Food?    Location & Aesthetics - Located in Phoenix on West Indian School Road.   The area is pretty busy as the restaurant sits right on the busy road (and bus route) and is close to an intersection as well.  I wouldn't advise parking on West Indian School road. I would suggest either parking in front of the restaurant (limited parking spots available) or at the rear.  The parking stalls in front are small and are for the handicapped so if you're driving a large truck or SUV, you'd be safer parking in the rear. The parking in the rear isn't all that fancy (isn't paved well, has potholes, etc.) and looks rather run down but it's the only choice (-1) If those spots become filled, I'm not sure what other choice you'll have to park.  I did manage to see folks parking along the sides of the restaurant as it looked as if there was stalls there, but again, if you're driving a large vehicle, it might be tricky maneuvering through the side to get to the rear. The restaurant is a large open area, inside, with lots of tables and chairs and adequate space between them.  There's music which wasn't too loud and was actually 80's music playing at the time, a favorite of mine.  There's flat screen TV's along the walls with the volume muted but the programming looked as if it was Sabado Gigante playing at the time.  Menus - The usual, given upon arrival and when you're seated.  Very large, self-explanatory, and easy to understand.    Service - The staff was nice, friendly, warm, welcoming, and bilingual.  We were initially greeted in Spanish, then after their faux pas - that we didn't speak a lick of Spanish - apologies were quickly issued. Staff answered our questions adequately and did check up on us frequently throughout our visit - very attentive!  Food - Upon being seated, it would appear that every table is given a complimentary bowl of chips and salsa.  Chips was fresh.  Salsa wasn't too thick, and though it appeared a little on the watery side, it was well seasoned and not too spicy. For drinks, we ordered the Aguas Frescas Naturales - iced water, sugar, and choice of fruit which came in a large glass with a miniature umbrella and looked like a large smoothie which was fresh and very tasty.  These drinks, it would appear, are made right there in a corner of the restaurant that looked like a little cabana. As for the main meal - I came here for the Torta Del Rey - Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage and Mexican sausage come with tomato, onions, avocado, chipotle sauce, smear of refried beans and potatoes ruffles on the side, and was a huge sandwich.  All ingredients came together nicely and completed each other really well, it was fresh, very hot, and very tasty. Sadly, I have to say that food won this fight and I had to take the remainder home.  I definitely do like this place and it's got lots on the menu - things to try that will bring me back for sure!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Peoria in the same shopping center as  Hobby Lobby.  Parking is plentiful though there are surrounding businesses and it may at times be difficult to find suitable parking.  Parking lot is large and well lit too. The restaurant is well lit and seating is ample though I would've like to see more seating.  The restaurant was clean as was the bathroom.  Menu - The menu is very simple and is posted on large billboard like signs over the cashier.    Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming and answered any questions I had.  Prices were very reasonable.  Food - this restaurant, their menu, and even their name reminds me of a Caribbean restaurant and they even try to mimic their meals after a Caribbean restaurant, e.g. all or most dishes come with rice and vegetables similar to Caribbean dishes. The veggies were moist, fresh, and crunchy.  The rice (white) was soft and well steamed.  I had the pork ends which was well seasoned, soft and tender.  Definitely will be coming back here for more!!!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Avondale just off of McDowell Road.   It's a little difficult to find amongst the many different stores in the strip mall but once you find Frazee Paint then it's opposite. There's lots of available space and parking. The store is spacious and well lit with lots of maneuverability throughout.    Service - The staff was very nice, friendly, warm, welcoming, and accommodating.  I was greeted immediately as I walked through the days.   I came in to have my road bike serviced.  After our move here to Arizona, the bike got pretty banged up en route.   I explained what the issues were and what I wanted to have done.  The bike was taken, assessed and immediately I was given a price for the repairs/service which was very reasonable.   I was also shown various products/accessories I needed to have replaced.  There wasn't any pressuring sales tactics.  When I left I was told that my bike would be ready by tomorrow however about 30 minutes after I left the store, I got a call stating that the bike was already serviced with the necessary minor repairs made.   I was really impressed with the speed of service offered here.  Despite being told that I could pick up the bike tomorrow, I still have to wait for an item to be ordered from another one of their satellite stores in California so I opted to leave it there till the item came in.  I really do like the feeling knowing that my bike (Trek) was being taken care of by the people who have the same name over the store - Trek!  Most definitely will be returning here for continued service with them.

This is great library to come to if you crave some peace and quiet.  It's located in Waddell and nestled at the base of the White Tank Mountain.  It's a bit of a drive from Surpise (about 28 minutes) but in my opinion, it's worth it.  It's peaceful and serene here.  Sometimes I don't even feel like going into the library.  When I exit my car, I just want to drink in the panoramic view of the West Valley and as I said, it's so quiet...there's no traffic, no cars...just quiet! The library itself is spacious and well lit.  If you want a more spectacular view while you're studying or reading, as you enter head to the back of the library where the large windows are and there you can see more of the White Tank Mountains. The library staff are friendly and helpful when needed.  I find the selections small or limited. I don't use the computer and I'm not sure if they offer free internet for patrons but the library does have free wifi so that's helpful if you bring your tablet or laptop. The library is usually quiet except for the occasional noisy kid.

Decided to come here for some soul nourishment.  I have to say, the place was big.  Lots of parking available which was easily marked with signs and/or staff directing you.  For the elderly there was golf carts for assistance in getting to the facility if they parked too far. Some parts of the Surprise campus was under construction which meant walking on dirt pathways into the facility. Dress is casual which for me I thought unusual.  Call me old fashioned but I thought we had to dress up for church as a sign of respect...oh well, I guess the times have changed. Staff/employees was super-friendly and welcoming. Before heading into the auditorium for the mass, there's a small bookstore/gift shop and a small cafeteria that serves breakfast, lunch and coffee/tea. The auditorium was small but they informed the congregation that they were expanding so the small surroundings was only for a short time. Music is loud, live, on-stage, uplifting and broadcasted on screen for everyone to sing along.  Although there are some staff that come upon stage to talk, the main message is usually conveyed on screen and pre-recorded which was a bit of a turnoff for me as I expected a live on-stage presentation (-1) As for the on-screen message, I too wasn't impressed (-1) as I was expecting the presenter to take a verse from the Bible, take it apart, examine it, and apply it to everyday living but that wasn't the case as they talked about a central theme - as of writing this, the theme they discussed for this week was on Wisdom. Newcomers weren't expected to tithe but it does seem that the church expects 10% of one's salary for tithing from what I've read on their site. There's no formal confessional booth so I'm guessing one was supposed to confess personally then choose to accept their communion which was passed around on a platter rather than coming up the aisle as in a Catholic church.  The platter that is passed around consists of small bits of crackers (didn't resemble wafers) and small cups of grape juice. Mass was held for an hour with homework given.  Another turnoff for me was the pushing of social media (like Tweeting on Twitter about your homework readings given) by the presenter on-screen. (-1) After mass, newcomers were welcomed to approach the welcome desk where they were asked to supply their address, email, and phone number.  I only supplied my address and email and have noticed that I have started getting both mail and email which I had unexpected, yet another turnoff. Very questionable if I'll be coming back to nourish my soul here.

Came here to try their much talked about Pho but settled on something else.  Nonetheless, this place was Pho-nomenal!  Location & Aesthetics - located on Bell Road (corner of Bell and Litchfield) between Longhorn Steakhouse and Carrabba's. It might be easy to miss from Bell Road because what you see from Bell Road is the rear of some (not all) of the restaurants as their facades face south.  The sign to the restaurant is large enough from Bell Road so I'm thinking you won't miss it.  Even if you miss it while traveling west, it's not a problem and very easy to make a U-turn on Bell as there are enough U-turn options available on the road. Lots of parking in the rear, and the parking lot was well lit. The interior of the restaurant is well-lit if you're dining in the evening as we were, and I'm guessing if you're dining in for lunch too, you won't have a problem as the restaurant is surrounded with glass windows.  There is also the option to dine alfresco at the side of the restaurant. Normally I would minus a point here as the restaurant was on the small side and felt cramped however the owner - Dennis did come around and happened to introduce himself to us, asked how we knew of the place and picked it (told him Yelp of course!), as well as indulged in some small talk, and did mention that he was expanding the place by taking over the space next door which will be occurring mid-December to sometime in January, and even extended a personal invitation for us to attend the grand re-openinging. The place was also exceptionally clean.  The noise level was average as it was a Friday evening but wasn't overly loud that I couldn't hear anyone in my party. Despite the place being really busy for a Friday evening, I didn't notice anyone having to wait for seating.  Service/Menus - menus were provided to us as by our waitress soon as we were seated.  Very easy to read and understand.  Even our questions were answered promptly.  Our waitress took our drink orders immediately and gave us time to think about what we wanted to order.  Drinks came promptly and our waitress even saved us some money.  We came in a minute before happy hour was finished (3-6 PM).  Thankfully our waitress put in our drink and appetizer orders just in time so we ended up paying a little less (Happy Hour prices) for those items.  Food/Drinks - For libations, I ordered the orange martini which was delicious and not too tart.  For appetizers, we ordered the shrimp & pork spring rolls (2 and its cut in half so you end up having 4 bites) - lettuce, bean sprouts, rice vermicelli, and mint served with a peanut sauce dip - very tasty particularly the ingredients added to the rolls like the mint and bean sprouts which served to enhance the tastiness of the shrimp and pork.  The rice vermicelli also gave the rolls a particularly nice transparent appearance.   For the main course, I thought I was going to have the Pho but instead settled for the Filet Mignon Shaken Beef - which is seared cubed beef tenderloin marinated in their house special soy, and served on a sizzling skillet with onions.  When this part of the dish, came out, it was sizzling and I even had folks who were passing by asking me if I ever had this dish and commenting on how great it is, and it's the only thing they order when they're there.  By itself, the beef was tender, moist, juicy, and very flavorful.  The soy wasn't overpowering or too salty, and the onions were sautéed beautifully and not burnt at all.  They will ask you how you want the beef cooked, and for me it was medium, and it was done exactly like that!  It was also recommended by the wait staff to mix the lime and salt and pepper that comes with the dish first, then use that to dip the beef in (as an option) to enhance its flavor.  I tried it and they were correct in that it did seem to multiple the flavor(s) tenfold! This dish is also served with jasmine rice which was warm, fresh, sticky (as rice should be in my opinion) and very tasty; a side salad; and a scallion broth which was hot and just the right thing to clear those sinuses (though mine wasn't in need of clearing).  Well, my intentions were to come here to sample their Pho and despite that not happening, I don't have any regrets coming here at all.   As promised to the owner, I will return to try their Pho!

Conveniently located in Surprise right after the entrance/exit ramps to the 303 and a couple stores next the Safeway supermarket.  Parking is sufficient.  The establishment was a bit dirty (-1) - tables were dirty and floor was dirty.  It was well lit and not too cramped.  At the time I visited, it was empty which was a plus for me.  Staff was friendly and service was fast. Food items didn't taste fresh, though not stale as I had a glazed donut and another in my party had a reduced-fat muffin.  Also complemented the order with a Hazelnut Swirl latte which was cold and tasty. Will be back because it's conveniently located for me and I'm a fan of Dunkin Donuts.

When I moved here into our house, we required a handyman for some minor work to the house.   I was referred to Ryan and his company by my home inspector and I can't be more happier with being referred to them. It took a week for Ryan and his company to come out.  He and his coworker Mark was friendly, very courteous, punctual, professional, and very efficient. They completed all the work and left the work areas clean.  The price was very reasonable, and for what I needed to have done, it only took them about 4 hours.  He even saved me money on some aspects of the work that was done, i.e. rather than going out to purchase new items, he tried to fix the broken items and was successful at doing so! Ryan has always been available if I had a handyman related question and would respond in a reasonable amount of time.  When he responds, he's never impatient or indignant and would take the time to explain what needs to be done, etc. He is usually very busy with jobs from small jobs to large jobs but I've never found him to not have the time to fit me into his schedule which is usually within a 2-week span, and for my needs, that works as it's not emergent in nature. If Ryan can't fit me into his schedule or can't come to my location, he usually goes out of his way to find someone who possibly can or is nearby that can take on the job and I really like that flexibility with working with him. I wouldn't trust anyone else into my home after working with Ryan and his company, and I look forward to continue working with him in future!

KFC move aside!  If you're looking for some really tasty non-greasy fried chicken, then look no further as this is the place to come.  Be warned though they only serve chicken fingers! The place can be a little crowded as it was on the weekend we visited so you may have to wait for a seat to open up if you're looking to dine in.  Alternatively you can choose the drive through but that line was long.   The restaurant was clean, well lit, and spacious though there wasn't a lot of space between some of the tables/chairs. Service was fast and the menu was very simple which I'm in favor of!   Ordered the 3-piece basket and a lemonade.  The lemonade wasn't too sweet but cool, refreshing and tasted as if it was fresh squeezed. The fries was plentiful and was shared.  The basket comes with a slice of buttered toast similar to Texas Toast which was soft, chewy and practically melted in your mouth. The chicken tenders was well seasoned, crispy, not greasy, tasty, juicy but what really stands out is that it was light.  It's filling but you don't feel that overstuffed after eating them.  I really like the simplified menu, the lemonade drinks, and the chicken tenders which is definitely a draw for me to be back here!

So the wifesky said we should eat something healthy today and wanted to give this place a try. Well, if the little lady wants to try this place out, that's what we'll do!  Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix on N 7th. Street.   A word of caution, if you use Google Maps (like I did) to search for this place, it'll show you a location on Scottsdale road (2240 N Scottsdale Rd #8 Tempe, AZ 85281) which obviously isn't the location for this restaurant as listed by Yelp (2022 N 7th St, Phoenix, AZ 85004).  I'm not sure if they're both affiliated or not. When you're driving on N 7th St. and you don't know what you're looking for, it's easy to miss the restaurant. The signage is large but it's decorative with decorative writing so drove past it.  The entrance too can be easy to miss as it's a bit small and the signage to enter was just as small. The parking is very limited and also....small, so if you've got a monster truck or SUV, you might have difficulty parking in the back.  Parking is also shared with their sister restaurant called Nami located next door that apparently serves vegetarian pastries.  We were lucky to snag a parking spot however, if the parking lot was full, then I'm not sure where else we would've been able to park. (-1) The outside had the usual seating for dinning but was small in size and close to the busy road. The interior was also on the small side. At first we didn't know if we had to be seated first and wait to be waited on, but after seeing a line forming by the cashier, we promptly joined it.  Apparently what you do is grab a menu, join the line, and while you're waiting to get to the front of the line, you choose your items to order.  Then you pay, you're given a number which you place at the edge of your table of your choosing wherever you wish to sit providing there's seating. I'm guessing if the place was packed, I'm not sure where we would've sat.  Perhaps we would've ordered to go.  Menus - the menu was self-explanatory.  The cashier who took our orders answered any questions we had about the food and the drinks.  Service - once staff brings out your food, we didn't see them again checking in on us.  Seems like they're there to either bring out the food and clean the tables/area.  Food - I had the big Wac -- 2 hand packed vegan burgers, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame bun and the thyme fries (you can choose fruit or a tahini salad). The thyme fries didn't taste different than regular fries which I guess is a good thing but it was certainly crunchy, fresh, hot, and very tasty.  It certainly wasn't oily and greasy like regular fries was. The vegan burger also didn't taste like a vegan burger and in fact, I thought I was going to be biting into a piece of cardboard.  While it wasn't meat from ground beef, it was certainly very tasty and didn't lack any flavors as I thought it would.  In fact, the special sauce, cheese, pickles, and onions only served to enhance the flavor of the veggie burger patties itself and brought out the taste even more.  Even the sesame bun was soft and fresh as if it was just baked.   I think the various vegan items on the menu is enough to bring me back however I'm a bit leery of how small the establishment and their parking is.

Happily popped in here for lunch, came out with nothing but regret!  Placed is located in Surprise just off Bell Road in a small strip mall nestled between Papa John's and a barber shop. Lots of parking however I noticed signs for only one-hour parking (-1).   The place is well lit but small with only seating against the wall.  There is seating outside however there aren't any misters and this is Arizona folks!   Staff who greeted us at the cash register was friendly and asked if we'd like menus which we did.  Took some time to order and wasn't rushed.  I ordered the corned beef sandwich with a side of potato salad, another in my party ordered the basil mascarpone burger with chili fries, and another in my party ordered the make-a-sandwich. The portions was very small and not very filling (-1).  The side of potato salad I ordered as my side was placed in a small cup similar to those cups filled with butter you dip lobster in...it was that small!  The sandwich itself was nothing to write home about as I have been to numerous NY delis and New England delis and it definitely didn't compare. The biggest turnoff of this visit was when one person in my party found a long stranded light-brown colored hair in her sandwich which immediately got her turned off and infuriated.  We alerted the waitress who initially brought our meals to the table and she simply looked at us without a word of apology, then said, "I could re-make the sandwich!"  That's all well and good but what about an apology!  (-2)   We decided then and there we were prepared to leave and asked for the sandwich that was being "remade" to go.  The waitress brought it to our table, we said thanks, and she walked away with not so much as a word or an apology for our experience! This is definitely not a place to put on your radar and will not be coming here ever again!

Really great service!  It's a one-man operation but he does everything from USPS, UPS, FedEx, to DHL.  He has mailing supplies and stationery.  Extra services include faxes, scans, and if you want to send him a document you can do so via a secure email and he'll print it await your instructions.  The owner is super friendly and very helpful.   After discovering this place, I definitely won't be going anywhere else for my mailing/packaging needs!

I decided to use this place of business, based on many positive reviews from Yelp, and I have to I am very happy to have done so. Initially I reached out to the email on their website and immediately received a response, no doubt, from the owner Rick.  We emailed back and forth - talked prices, choices, budget, and a time to come in. I came in and Rick was as friendly in person as he was in his emails!  No pressure or high sales tactics.  Rick gives you the advantages and disadvantages of each product and takes the time to spend it with you explaining everything.  Even while he's meeting with you, he ignores his phone and anything else, dedicating the time especially to you.  He'll even tell you to go home and think about it if you like. Once you commit to a product, you have the option of waiting in the waiting room which has comfy sofas, water, a TV, bathroom facilities, and coffee and even free wi-fi.   It's been many weeks since my product was applied and I couldn't be more happier and pleased with the extremely courteous and professional service and pricing.  Even after the application, I had questions and Rick answered them promptly via email which was the method I chose for communication. Definitely will be sending many others his way and even the wife!

Located just to the right of the Sprouts supermarket and behind the Shell gas station and car wash.  The strip mall that this business is located in is large so you might have to drive around a bit to see it as the sign is on the small size.  Parking can be a hassle to find as the barbershop shares the parking spaces with other businesses in the strip mall so that can be a hassle (-1).  The business itself is clean and well lit with lots of TV's - both small and large to keep yourself occupied while you wait though I didn't find too much reading material available.  Staff have greeted me when I entered and they're super friendly.  The barbershop was well staffed for a Saturday with 3 females and 1 male.  It was my observation that the female barbers cut faster than the male.  When you enter, you must sign in which is a first for me as I've never had to do this before at a barbershop but that's okay as I guess it lets the staff know who came in and in what order.  Prices are clearly posted on the wall right in front of the sign in sheet and are very reasonable.  Don't forget to tip your barber!  After you get your hair cut, you're given a free complimentary warm towel that's wrapped/draped over your head including a back massage with one of those handheld massaging devices.  They do clean your head, ears, neck areas ensuring there's little to no cut hair around when you leave so if you're on break from your job or have to go to an appointment after, that's good because you don't need to rush home to shower.  With the great service and staff plus the location, I'll definitely be returning to get a little off the sides next time!

I've always been a fan of Rita's Italian Ice since we lived back on the East Coast.  Staff are warm, welcoming and friendly. If you're a first timer here and unsure of what to try, I'd suggest asking for a sample to help you make up your mind as there's lots to choose from on the menu.   On this particular trip, it was hot outside and went for the grape Italian ice which was cool and refreshing.  The wifesky had a vanilla custard which was different than the frozen custard I've had at Freddy's down the street.  The frozen custard here tastes like a frozen soft serve but nonetheless it was good. Definitely will be back to try their gelati, misto, or blendini all recommended must-haves or must-tries!

Tough week at work....had to have some rehab.....Rehab Burger that is!  Location & Aesthetics - Located on E. 2nd St. in Scottsdale which was a bit of trip for me from my usually stomping ground in the West Valley but it was worth the drive. Parking is a bit of a mystery as I couldn't figure out where I was allowed to park.  There weren't any signs where patrons was instructed to park so I just followed the crowd and parked across the street where there was a large parking lot.   The restaurant itself looks small on the outside and even the outside patio with its fans and misters was small and seemed crowded with the arrangement of the tables and chairs being in close proximity to each other.  The inside was the same - small.   Another mystery was how customers were seated.  For example, from my observations, a party of two was sometimes seated at a table with four chairs with the two other chairs being unused.  On the other hand, I noticed a party of two with a kid was seated at the long table - a long table with a slew of high chairs on either side of it, where the couple was supposed to sit opposite each other and not side-by-side. The couple with the kid had to put their kid on one of those high chairs which, in my opinion, didn't look too safe or too comfortable. The way the chairs are bunched up together at the long table, was in close proximity to each other, meaning that on a day when the place might be packed, I could envision folks sitting elbow-to-elbow at said long table which is really not comforting in my opinion!  (-1) Thankfully, when we went (on a Friday evening), there wasn't anyone sitting immediately next to us at this long table but rather a chair over from us on either side which didn't make the situation stifling.  Menus - The usual, given upon arrival and when you're seated.  Very large, self-explanatory, and easy to understand.    Service - The staff was nice, friendly, warm, welcoming, and answered any questions we had about the meals. Our waitress was prompt with introducing herself to us upon being seated, and was also prompt with the complimentary glasses of water (which tasted stale), and our drinks. Despite having folks around us and having their orders taken after our orders, we did notice that our orders came well after theirs but it wasn't unnerving.   Food - The burgers were very tasty and creative.  I like the fact the have their own names, sizes (only 2 - Rehab or Relapse), their own particular and peculiar set of ingredients which I think makes each one a unique creation and a taste unto itself. I ordered the BBQ Burger but couldn't tell if it was a Relapse size or a Rehab size as I had forgotten to mention it to the waitress but nonetheless it tasted superbly. I also like you can choose the type of bun to go along with your burger.  Unfortunately, for sides, you're only allowed fries or sweet potato tots (two dipping sauces supplied with it); the latter was very tasty.  I can see the great variety in their burger creations can possibly bring me back despite the place being small.

Really loved stumbling upon this place as we've been big fans of frozen yogurt from back East. Staff was tremendously outgoing and friendly despite the place being packed with patrons.  Staff wasn't overwhelmed or stressed. The place was well lit and really clean though on the small size but most frozen yogurt joints are which isn't a big deal for me. There's available tiny cups at the entrance/exit so be sure to grab one to sample the flavors. I liked the many selections and varieties.  I also liked that there seemed to be a larger variety of toppings available versus what I've seen at other frozen yogurt places plus there's a variety of syrups to try at the checkout. Really worth visiting again!

Location & Aesthetics - Not sure where this place is located except that it's in Queen Creek.  We stumbled upon it after a business meeting and our driver was asking us where we wanted to eat.  After much indecision, the driver said, let's eat here as he was passing by it and we all agreed saying why not.   There's lots of parking as it's located in a small strip mall.  The exterior and interior was exceptional clean including their bathroom and the whole place was well lit.  We came in a little after lunch and the place was quiet with no lines.  Menu - Can either be found on up on the wall behind the cashier.  Menus weren't overwhelming to read or comprehend and the cashier did answer any questions we had about our orders.  The sandwich comes in two sizes - an 18 inch and I believe a 21 inch though don't quote me on the latter as I'm not sure about it.  I opted for the 18 inch which was more than enough for me and very filling.  Service - The staff was very friendly and even brought out our meals to the table and even picked up our empty baskets and asked us how our meals were.  Food - I ordered the steak and cheese which was delicious.  The cheese was well melted, the steak well seasoned and soft, and the bread was soft and tender as if they just baked it themselves.  You can do the meal option which gives you a drink and chips.  For soda, they have one of those new fan dangled soda machines that boasts on offering over 100 choices.    Rating - 5/5.  Definitely can't find anything wrong with this place and only wished my trip was long enough for me to have returned!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Surprise in the same area as Home Depot (just opposite) just off Bell Road.  The restaurant's signage can be a little difficult to miss as the strip mall is large with many stores so it can be overlooked.  Once you're facing Office Max, just walk to the right pass Panda Express and a couple other stores and you shouldn't miss it then.   Plenty of parking is available but remember parking spots are shared with other surrounding businesses so the parking area can get a little busy but don't fret, if you can't find a parking spot in front of the business, you can easily park in the surrounding vicinity and walk, and the walk isn't far at all...just a couple feet.   The restaurant is clean, spacious and well lit however my only gripe with the atmosphere was there was no separate place to order to go.  If one wanted to place an order to go, either you would call ahead or, if you're on the premises, you have to walk through the restaurant, pass the dinning tables where other patrons are dining  Menu - The menu is available at the counter where you place your order to go.  You can even chose to sit at the counter which resembles a bar counter and wait for the order or eat it there.  There's a lunch menu which is a bit cheaper ($8).  I also believe you can place your order online as well.    Service - The staff was nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  The lady who took our orders answered any questions we had.    Food - I order the sweet and sour chicken which, to my puzzlement, came separated in two containers unlike the rest of the orders that was placed.  I guess this was to ensure the rice didn't become saturated with the sweet and sour sauce.   The rice was soft and hot (the way I prefer), the chicken was well cooked and seasoned with the correct proportion of chicken to vegetables in the sweet and sour sauce.  The latter - the sweet and sour sauce was perfectly made with the correct ratio of sweet versus sour, neither being too overpowering to the other.  I will definitely be back to try some of their other offerings on the menu!

I heard John Snoh (for you Game of Thrones fans) was in town, at this place, so I came to see him, but oh boy, did I get it wrong!  Location & Aesthetics - located in on E Camelback Road with no trouble spotting the business with their large outdoor sign. Parking was iffy as I found their parking lot to be on the small side as the parking is shared with other businesses within the same compound (-0.5). Interior decor was interesting as it was decorated with anime, Star Wars, and a mishmash of other posters/pictures.  They even had a flat screen TV that was playing anime.  I suddenly asked myself, "Was I too old to be in this place?"  I felt as if I wandered back to my teenage years when I collected and traded Pokemon cards.  Patrons were even playing board games on the tables which I've never seen being allowed before at a business....interesting concept.  After all, the place does look hip (does anyone say that anymore....now I'm starting to feel old....I digress!) Seating is limited inside and outside as the place is small in my opinion.  As you enter, there's seating on the left and right - large tables with chairs and smaller tables with chairs, and one small bench outside that could probably seat 2-3 (-0.5).  When we arrived, practically all the tables were occupied, even the larger tables with chairs had only 2 patrons. Thankfully we snagged a table, while waiting for our orders, as some folks were leaving.  Menus - posted on a board above the cashier, and it was overwhelming so I suggest you take a good gander before ordering.  I say this because when it came time to place my order, I got it wrong.        Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  They answered our questions about the menu, and even that little faux pas I made with my order, was corrected nicely and friendly by them.  Food - For me, I had the build your own snoh - medium with two toppings (this is where I got it wrong as I thought it was 2 flavors but it's 2 toppings) + plus glaze.  I had the strawberry + 2 toppings of strawberries and custard pudding + glaze of condensed milk drizzled on top. The strawberries was fresh and sweet (no tartness); the custard pudding didn't look runny but held up on its own; the condensed milk was fresh as well and insanely sweet (it's supposed to be so no complaints there) but what I liked was that is was drizzled on top of the whole creation, not poured.  I have been used to it being doused on top until it's running over the cup which I think is overkill. The snoh I left for last to comment on.  When I came here for shaved ice, I was expecting  chipped crunchy ice as I am used to and not a a fluffy snow type of shaved ice.  When I had shaved ice in the Islands, it was the former - chipped crunchy ice, drizzled with guava syrup and then drizzled with the optional condensed milk and that was it.  For me, it was interesting to try this and my first impression is that I love it.  I like the fact that it isn't super sweet, like frozen yogurt, but it's lighter and fluffier, almost like cotton candy...I guess I could go on and on with the similes as I write this.  I've never had anything like this before and I definitely do like it.  I like the menu items and the insane permutations and combinations that one can utilize to create one of these things.  They also have combo cups and even creations on large dinner sized plates where, let's say, a family can dug into from the center of the table, and I think on my next return I'd certainly like to try one of those.  Most definitely do recommend and will return!

We were in the mood for some burgers and fries for our Friday evening out but decided to try something different from our usual burger joints.  Location & Aesthetics - located on East Indian School Road in Phoenix.  The restaurant cannot be missed with its bright blue colored exterior, and large sign 'The Stand' (no relation to Stephen King's novel). There is a drive through option.    Parking was available on the side and rear of the restaurant but in my opinion not adequate for large crowds.  If dining in, the restaurant had minimal seating inside; there is some seating available under their covered patio which offered lots of privacy from the peering eyes of motorists from East Indian School Road.   For the minimal parking and dine-in seating (-1).  The outside seating was comfortable with music playing and a large dehumidifier to keep patrons cool (no misters).  I'm guessing it might be a bit difficult to eat out on the patio during the middle of the summer months.  Menus - clearly displayed over the cashier, simple, and easy to read.  They offer one burger with and without cheese; stand-ins which I didn't try; tacos and sides, and drinks. The offer a variety of drinks including horchata and a drink called a "Jamaica" which tastes like sorrel (a drink known in the Caribbean) but upon further research I discovered it's Hibiscus Iced Tea (hope I'm not wrong on that). Staff offered us samples of both to try.   Service - Staff was extremely friendly and greeted us immediately as we entered and asked if we were dining in and took our names.  They answered any questions we had about the menu and drinks.  Food - For me I ordered the Standard burger (2 House-Ground All Beef Patty, Crisp Leafed Lettuce, Fresh Tomato, Sliced Onion, Dill Pickle, and Stand Sauce) without the cheese, a chicken taco and a side of fries with the "Jamaica" drink. Despite the burger not oozing with juices and had a dry look to it, it was supremely tasty!  The burger itself was well seasoned and fresh along with the ingredients like the lettuce, tomato, onions (not overpowering), and the dill pickle.  I couldn't really tell whether the Stand sauce was in there or not but, if it was, it didn't deter from the taste of the burger.  The burger wasn't greasy, messy, or full of oils.   The fries was fresh cut, well seasoned with the right amount of salt and again wasn't oily or greasy. The chicken taco (Warm Corn Tortillas, Tender Roast Chicken, Pickled Red Onion, Cotija Queso Fresco, Fresh Cilantro) was also extremely tasty and my only regret was not ordering more, and even if I did, the wifesky would've put the kibosh on that one!  All of its ingredients were fresh, well seasoned, and served hot.  Even the tender roasted chicken tasted as if it was just made. The entire meal wen down easy and most importantly I didn't have that, "I feel overly stuffed," feeling post-prandial.  Despite it being a little out of the way from where I live, I'd still very much love to visit here again as I thoroughly enjoyed the burgers, tacos, and the exotic 'Jamaica' drink!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Glendale off Bell Road, almost hidden behind Paradise Bakery, and is next to Five Guys. Plenty of parking despite sharing the parking lot with Five Guys.  Restaurant is spacious, well lit, was clean at the time of our visit.   Lighting wasn't too bright or too dim.  Menu - posted on a large billboard on the wall as you enter.  What I did like and found different was the order system - one orders their sandwich by filling out a multiple-choice menu that's already pre-printed on their sandwich bag, then you hand the sandwich bag to one of the guys behind the counter and they go to work.  There's even a desk with pens to fill out your choices. The sandwiches were tasty and for their sizes, filling enough.  Prices were reasonable.   Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming and answered any questions I had.    I'll think I'll definitely give them another try.

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Surprise just opposite from Fry's.  It cannot be missed as there aren't really any nearby or adjoining businesses.   Parking is plentiful and there's even a drive through if that's your desire.   The restaurant is clean and well lit including their bathrooms as well.  Interesting thing, if and when you go into their bathroom, there's these miniature monitors attached to the faucets that flash these advertisements which I found to be really cool as I've never seen that before.   Menu - Their menu is large and it will take you a couple minutes to figure out what you want to eat so you'd better step aside for the other patrons, at least, that's what we did.  Menu is clear and above the cashier and staff are very helpful in answering any questions you may have.      Service - The staff was very friendly!  There's staff at the order counter, staff at the pick-up counter, and staff that walk around and even clear up your table for you.  All of them were very helpful and friendly.  Food - I ordered the number 1 which was a double hamburger patty hamburger with all the fixings which came with their signature shoestring fries and I substituted my drink for a large vanilla milkshake. The hamburger was mouthwatering and done just right.  The condiments and all the toppings tasted fresh.  The patty was thin yet still juicy and tasty.  The burger wasn't greasy or sloppy with everything falling out.  The buns was soft as if they just came out of the oven. The shoestring fries was hot, crunchy and tasty.  I think I could could've ate 2-3 portions as it didn't feel as if it was filling.  It was that light! The vanilla shake was a definite pleaser!  It tasted as if it was made with real ice-cream, it was very cream and rich, and cold!  I ordered it for myself but the wifesky drank most of it and kept apologizing!  Rating - 5/5.  Definitely will be worth coming back for their frozen custard which I'm kicking myself for for not trying but it's an excuse to come back isn't it!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Scottsdale somewhat on the corner of Scottsdale & Bell Road.  The restaurant cannot be missed as the sign was visible from both roads.   Lots of available parking.  Upon entering there's no delineation of eating area and line-up area to order as one does have to walk through the eating area amongst the tables and proceed to the from to order.  Not a big deal for me. The restaurant was well lit with lots of space.  One can choose to eat inside or out though the latter was a bit limited on space if you're there with a large party.  The eating areas were very clean even the bathroom facilities after a visit.      Menu - Clearly visible above the checkout and pretty much self-explanatory.    Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  They answered any questions we had regarding the menu.   There's even lots of young waitstaff that bring your food to you, cleans up the tables, and even would stop in and ask how's your meal which were also helpful in answering any questions we might've had.    Food - I had the fish and chips which came with a small cup of tartar sauce, a small cup of salad, and wedge of lemon.  The fries was hot and tasty.  The tartar sauce was well seasoned and looked like it had either chopped coriander or cilantro in it.  The salad was bland and was under seasoned.  The fish wasn't overly fried where there was more batter versus fish.  It was very well seasoned, soft and tender, and broke apart nicely....not tough.  My meal was served in a basket though I thought it should've been served in a large plate instead.  I found the basket too small. (-1) The wife had the rice with salad and mahi mahi and found that it too could've been served in a large plate.  I only had a bite of her fish and it was the same as mine - soft, very tender (very easy to cut into), well seasoned, and didn't have that briny sea-salt taste to it as I've encountered at other restaurants.  I really do like this place and will definitely be back to try their fish taco which I saw someone devouring, and try their fish burgers!

When we moved here to Arizona, we realized we had to hire a landscaper for our yard.  I was referred to Omar and his company by my realtor and I couldn't be more happier with them. Omar showed up to my residence within a reasonable time - within a week.  We discussed his different plans and what they entailed and how it would be incorporated into my yard and my needs. A week later, he and his company began work.  When he began, he realized that the irrigation system was dysfunctional and we also required him to replant a small tree on the front of the property per HOA guidelines.  Omar promptly fixed the irrigation and replanted the tree without any hassle or fuss. To this day (almost a year), Omar and his company still services my yard and he and his men have provided outstanding work and are very professional. The trees are always trimmed properly and beautifully.  The lawn is mowed to the right height and even in winter, he replants the grass seed to coincide with the winter months, and I've been told (by him) that come summer, he'll replant another grass seed to coincide with those months and it's no problem for him.  He and his men always leave with the yard super clean and free from dust or debris.  He also takes care of the weeds around the property as well. He has even provided advice on things ranging from a leaning tree we have out front and whether to have it removed or not; redecorating our backyard like changing the stones and planting trees to provide extra privacy; and to what I should do if I see a scorpion or two around. He's always available for questioning and would answer within a reasonable time.  Very friendly, courteous, helpful, and professional and his this goes for his crew as well. I look forward to continue working with Omar and his company to service my yard and all my landscaping needs in future! No regrets in being referred to Omar and his company....none!

I was in the mood for some Trinidadian food and thought I'd give this place a try after learning that the owners are from Trinidad but sadly I was disappointed.  Read on for more....  Location & Aesthetics - Located in Phoenix or rather in Glendale as Yelp would list the address; however if you're using a GPS as I did to find the place and use the Phoenix address as was printed on their business card (previously given to me), you will be directed to a residential area.  You must use the Glendale one listed, and you will know that you've found the right place when you near Bethany Road and the U-Haul depot.  Parking can be hit or miss as they share the parking lot area with other business so I can envision the area becoming full.  If that's the case, then unfortunately there's no other place to park as the street is busy and one cannot park there.  Thankfully there was a tattoo parlor that closed which opens some parking spots.    Menu - Situated below the order counter and is self-explanatory.    Service - The staff was nice, friendly, warm, and welcoming.  Any questions we had was answered promptly despite not having any except for the occasional question asking if certain Trinidadian foods was available, e.g., if 'Buss-up-Shut (paratha roti) or 'Sada' roti was available?  Food - I ordered the curry chicken with channa and a side of 'Buss-up-Shut' (paratha roti).  The wife ordered the same except she had regular roti (sada roti).  We were hoping to order some Trinidad soda called 'Solo' but was disappointed to see that the restaurant didn't carry this (-1). While we waited, we were given a complimentary bowl of pholourie (fried batter shaped into balls) with some dip which was supposedly was tamarind but didn't taste like it.  Sadly the pholourie wasn't large and fluffy, wasn't well seasoned as expected, and tasted very bland as well as the dip which, if it was tamarind, would've tasted tangy and sweet but definitely didn't.   When the meals came, we discovered the plates was very small and as such the food was overflowing from the plate after being piled high on it (-1 for inappropriate sized plates). The channa and chicken tasted okay - both well cooked however the accompanying curry in which these items swam in was very bland and didn't at all taste anything like the curry from Trinidad which by the way, the country does make its own brand. While we ate the meals, we were provided with a complimentary plate with a 'Doubles' - two bara (fried flat bread) with channa.  The bara tasted tasteless with no seasoning and one could surmise that only flour and water was used to make the bara.  The channa was okay although the plate was heavily seasoned with pepper and sadly we couldn't take another bite of the 'Doubles'. (-1 for the food)  I definitely wouldn't be back here based on how poorly the food tasted as it wasn't anything like what Trinidadian food tastes like.

I'm really happy we found this location versus the one in Goodyear not that the latter location is bad, it's just that the one in Surprise is closer to us.    Store was clean, spacious and well lit and seemed to have a little more space than the one in Goodyear which was a plus.  Staff was friendly, courteous, and helpful.   Seemed to have more machines open versus when we visited the location in Goodyear as a couple of the machines were out of service in the latter.  We loved the flavors and the variety of toppings offered.  Definitely will be back to this location!

You want to get your dog groomed the right way - then this is the place to come!  Remember stay and support your local business.  Don't take your pooch to those large pet business chains for grooming!  Location - conveniently located in Surprise along West Bell Road opposite Walgreens, just on the corner with Reems Road.   The business is located in that shopping center/strip mall on the corner behind Sonic and next to the gym/fitness center. Lots of available parking and the business is not difficult to find with large signs and two easily identifiable entrances.  Aesthetics - Inside is very large - both the dog grooming area and the waiting area.  As you enter, the business is bright with soft colors on the walls, lots of windows/glass, and smells great!   The last part is important because you don't want to visit a dog grooming business and it smells doggy or of anything else!   Even the area where the animals are groomed has lots of space for them to run about and socialize with each other!  No evidence of cramping at all!  Service - Only one word the sums it up - excellent!  The business is run by Margo and she's there taking calls, greeting folks as they enter, and grooming.  Very warm, welcoming, and pleasant lady!  Initially when I visited I thought it was a one-woman-show but later when I returned to pick up my dog, she had help.  Despite being busy, she is very organized and excellent with the dogs.  She doesn't shout or yell at them and was very patient.   She's very accommodating in terms of timing and scheduling and was willing to accommodate my schedule.   She can usually get you in within a day and that's what she did with me - I called on Friday and was able to get an appointment on Saturday which fit my schedule perfectly.   Prices are affordable for a grooming which includes everything from teeth cleaning, nail clipping, to hair cut, etc. and you can tell what you want and what you would like to omit.  There's even a 10% discount for new customers.   Each dog is individually cared for and not treated like a conveyor line production like you might find at some of the large pet chains.   I have been going to many dog groomers and usually my dog will come back with some kind of problem, e.g. an allergy to the shampoos used but this wasn't the case with Margo.  My dog returned home happy and healthy without any problems!   Rating - 5/5 stars!  Definitely will be returning and have already scheduled my 8-week follow up appointment!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Tempe just adjacent to the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.   Parking is limited.  I wouldn't advice parking on the street besides I don't even think you could as the road is busy with traffic.  Parking is limited as the lot is small and gets filled up quickly.  This is a popular joint and many people come from all over to eat here.  If the parking lot is filled, my suggestion would be to park in surrounding businesses parking lots but only on the weekend as I did.  When I did so, the businesses were closed and their lots were empty except some of the restaurants customers had also parked in the lots as well.   When you arrive, there's a staff member who directs traffic in the parking lot and will let you know what's finished and what isn't.  That's right, you heard me correctly, if you don't get there early enough, their meats will finish which I hadn't known.   More often than not, when you arrive you will encounter a line unless you ordered your food online and just came by to pick it up.  Be forewarned, the line moves snail-pace slow as there's only 1 carving station so be prepared to spend some time in the line.  Thankfully there's chairs to sit if you're in line and there's free bottles of water.  I even saw a bottle of sunscreen though I wasn't sure if that was for everyone or if someone left it there by mistake.  Menu - Unfortunately there aren't any menus available to view but you can see what's available online.  Alternatively you can ask the gentleman who's directing traffic and he'll take you out of the line and let you go inside and take a pic of the menu with your phone as I saw someone did who was in front of me.  You can order your meats by the pound, by the plate, or by sandwich which is basically it.  Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  There's 3 behind the counter - the carver who individually cuts the meat and weighs it for you, a guy who serves you the sides, and the cashier.  There's another guy who walked around with an apron that looked like the cook so I assumed he must've owned the place. You can eat inside which is small or outside that has long picnic like tables.  Food - Now, despite the fact that the meats do run out because from what the guy who was walking said (the one with the apron), he only cooks 'x' amount of meat a day and don't reheat so when it runs out that's it, but I have to say it's really worth the wait in line.  By the time I got to the counter, there was only brisket and turkey for my 2-meat plate combo.   The brisket is melt-in-your-mouth good!  The turkey was juicy, tasty, and very well seasoned.   My sides - baked beans which has a little bit of kick to it, well seasoned with meat in it.  My next side - cole slaw - vegetables were crunchy and seasoned well and it wasn't too sweet or tangy. You can also get as a free option to adorn your plate - pickles, onions, and 2 slices of bread.  Definitely will be coming back here for more of their meats that ran out, e.g. the sausage, the pork ribs, and the short ribs.  Guess next time I'll have to arrive a bit earlier!

If you hail from the Caribbean as I am and you're looking to stock up on any kind of item from back home that'll make you nostalgic, then this is the place for you.  Let me know start, the place is located in a small strip mall and wasn't hard to find with my GPS.  The sign outside was large enough to see from far.   Parking is more than generous.  The outside of the establishment is clean.    As you enter, I was greeted by the friendly employees.  On the left is the grocery side and on the right is the restaurant side with some tables and chairs for eating.  On this particular visit, we found everything we were looking for that couldn't be found at any local grocery store, Walmart, or Target.  We picked up curry and saffron powder, cooking butter, a soft drink called 'Solo', poulourie mix, and a jar of mango chutney all produced in our homeland - Trinidad and all reasonably priced may I add!  While we were there, we figured we'd grab a bite to eat so I ordered the regular curry goat which comes with 2 sides so I chose the rice and beans along with the fried plantains which was very tasty and served hot!  Thankfully the curry goat wasn't too spicy.  The regular is $`13 and was enough for two or maybe if you leave any leftovers, it can go for dinner tonight but I consumed it all. One of the food items we came for was roti but they were out but will be retuning in a couple days for it....it's a must have!  We were really pleased to have found this place through the internet and Yelp and seeing as they carry many of the products that are so hard to find in our local neighborhood markets and groceries, we will definitely be returning, not just for that roti, but for many other grocery items!

These are truly the most wanted tacos around!  Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix just off N 7th Street, the business can be a little inconspicuous to notice at first, but once you enter the little strip mall where it's located, you won't have any trouble finding it. Lots of available parking in a large parking lot. Interior decor is interesting as they have paintings of Spanish dressed wrestlers.  The dining room with its comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and clean, l  Menus - clearly posted above the food preparation area however I would warn that you take some time to process it as it can be a little confusing what to choose from as a first timer like myself.  Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming, and answered the many questions we had about the menu items.  They even were accommodating enough to suggest and create a menu for us based on what was most popular which I found to be absolutely fantastic!  Food - I had three large tacos with everything on it, and though I can't exactly say what I had as I gave the food preparers the option to create it based on what's popular, I have to say the food was outstanding.  I do know that one taco had chicken, one had beef, and another had pork and they all tasted great - hot, tasty, and very well seasoned with all the toppings fresh.  Remember, each category of chicken and pork has 5 types of levels of spiciness or meats (not sure if the latter is correct as I am no connoisseur of tacos so forgive the misinformation); the beef only has 4 levels.  I do know that the preparer made one with some spiciness, and I have to say, it did have some kick to it so for those with sensitive palettes, watch out.  Overall, really great food, atmosphere, lots of menu items to choose from, and great staff! Will most definitely be back!

Location & Aesthetics - Located in Goodyear on Litchfield Road and with brightly lit neon signs (at least that's what I thought it was) you definitely can't miss this place.  Parking is plentiful though it was a bit tough to find a spot when we went on a Friday night, thankfully there were a couple available spots.  Parking lot is large and well lit too. As we approached the front door/entrance we encountered a long line going out the door and wondered if we had to make reservations or what.  As we discussed whether to do take out, a friendly patron who overheard us told us to not question the long line and it was actually well worth to wait.  She even suggested we try the sliced turkey!  Menu - The menu is very simple and is posted on large billboard like signs over the cashiers, on your way to the cashiers, and a copy is even handed to you as you enter.  Everything is served a la carte and the meats are served by the pound with their prices being very reasonable!  Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming.  As you enter, you're asked if you've ever been here before, and if not, a brief explanation of how their system of ordering and their menu works....wasn't difficult to comprehend.   Food - On my way to the cashier's, one encounters a large trough filled with a variety of drinks, even alcohol all in ice-cold water with lots of ice.  If you desire, you can grab a small bucket and start filling it with various bottles of soda or alcohol to start consuming (which I saw) or wait till you get to the cashiers for checkout.   On your way to the cashiers, there's also a fridge that houses their signature potato salad, coleslaw, desserts, etc. to be grabbed if you want to add it to your meal.  I grabbed the potato salad which was rich, creamy, well seasoned, and very tasty.   As you get to the cashiers, you'll be greeted yet again, and asked if you've been here before.  If the answer is no, then you'll be given samples of any meat on the menu you'd like to try or you can simply refuse and go straight to the ordering if you so desire which I did and opted for the 1/2 lb. of baby back ribs.   Normally I'm not a fan of my baby back ribs falling off the bone so this suited me just fine.  It was semi-tender and you had to do a bit of work to get it off the bone which is the way I like it and it was very juicy, tasty, and supremely delicious.  My only regret was that I only ordered the 1/2 lb. rather than the whole but this gives me reason to return!   After the rest in my party had their samples and ordered, we ordered a small fountain drink (unlimited refills I believe). The layout of the place is unusual because obviously they've eliminated the waiter/waitress because you order your food and then you choose to eat though this takes place in a restaurant-styled atmosphere.  The tables are long picnic like tables so basically you choose anywhere you want to eat, sit and enjoy mind you the tables are together (though not all) so the potential to have others be sitting next to you is there.  On the tables, you can choose anyway you'd like to eat (be sure to clean up after yourself though) plus their sauces are never too far away on the table and there's plenty of it too....in large bottles so there's enough for everyone in your party!  Definitely will be coming back here for more of their meats, e.g. sliced turkey, brisket, etc.

We were looking for a place to eat on a Friday evening and decided to give this place a go as I discovered it was on my bookmarks!  Location & Aesthetics - located on W Indian School Road & the corner of W Wigwam Blvd.  The place was almost a little difficult to miss using the GPS as it told me to go further up W Indian School Road and make a U-turn to come back to the restaurant.  I found there wasn't any need to do that as all one had to do is turn into W Wigwam Blvd then turn into the strip mall area with the businesses.   The restaurant is nestled in a corner, of the strip mall, next to Royal Jasmine Thai, and it can be a little difficult to miss because their signage is a bit small (-0.5). The restaurant has lots of seating - indoors and out.  Very clean, with lots of space to walk between tables/chairs.  They have booths for dining or table and chairs and enough space for large parties/crowds/families.  Good lighting and low noise levels.  There was one TV in the corner, tuned to sports and wasn't loud.  Menus - were very simple - one menu with easy to read/understand dishes, beverages, etc. on either side.  I believe there's also a menu posted on the wall in case you're a walk-in and wish to place an order to go.    Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  We were greeted when we came in, asked if we've ever dined at the restaurant before, and asked if we wished for a booth or table/chair set-up. Our waitress showed up immediately after being seated and gave us a warm welcome as well.  Got our drink orders, wasn't pushy to get us to order something, but gave us enough time to decide what we wanted.   She answered any questions we had about menu items, and even made suggestions which was welcomed by some in our party. During our dining, the owner came by our table, greeted us, and asked how was the food, and made sure we were doing okay. Truly a warm feeling!  Food - For me, I had the pick two - pick any two items (fish, chicken, clam, shrimp) and it comes with fries and coleslaw.   I picked the fried haddock fish with fried shrimp.  The plate came with 2 large pieces of haddock fish, and 3 large pieces of jumpo shrimp.   The fish was lighted breaded and fried - wasn't very greasy and the fried batter wasn't too thick but seasoned just right.  In fact, it broke apart easily/flaky, was very crunchy, and the fish was fresh and well seasoned.  The fish was tender and moist too, and not too dry. The shrimp was the same - batter was light but made it very crunchy, and seasoned well enough that I consumed even the tail!  The shrimp was also fresh. The meal came with tartar sauce for the fish and shrimp sauce for the shrimp (2 small containers).  I didn't require more than that, but I'm sure if I did, I would've been provided with more if asked. The coleslaw was fresh, crunchy, well seasoned, and not too sweet and not too tangy, but just in-between which was perfect for me.   The coleslaw is served in a small cup/lid but I thought it could've been served in a small bowl, like the one you get at restaurants when you order a side of beans with your ribs.  In my opinion, I think the small plastic cup with lid is best for occasions when placing an order to go, and not necessarily for dining in. The fries was good - fresh, hot, but unfortunately on the salty side for me (-0.5).  If you check in with your Yelp app, there's a $5 off coupon for orders $30 or more. Also, when they bring the bill to you, you will discover, the bill is placed within the book 'One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish by Dr. Seuss.  Be sure to sign it and put any compliments you may have within the book prior to leaving!  It was really great to see, on all the pages, compliments, names, dates, etc. from all the folks who previously dined there!  I like the fact that this is a small, family owned business, and coupled with the great atmosphere, welcoming family staff, and great food, I will definitely recommend to try this place out.  I know, for me, I will be back to either dine in or for takeout.

Popped in here to grab a frappuccino as the wifesky was shopping.  What can I say about this store that's different from other Starbucks stores?    Location & Aesthetics - I love the location - along Bell Road in Peoria nestled among many retail stores.  It's easy to pop in here for your favorite drink while going about your shopping.   Parking immediately surrounding the store is limited but one can use the surrounding parking lots/areas and the walk isn't far at all. The store is clean and like any other Starbucks store, there's place to sit outside though I thought it was limited but I can't take a star away for this as I didn't explore the area fully and I was only there for an order to go. The inside was clean and unlike many of the other Starbucks stores I've been to, this was extraordinarily spacious! Wifi was strong and good and wasn't cutting out as I've experienced at other stores.  Service - The staff was nice, friendly, and warm.  I wasn't greeted with a friendly hello as I entered as I've encountered at other stores but in their defense they were busy when I entered.  Plus the wait for my drink wasn't long despite others being ahead of me.      Food - Order was correct and my drink was perfectly prepared with no issues.  Definitely will be back here.  Really happy this location was newly opened.  Very strategic in my opinion.

Over the weekend, had a hankering for some BBQ and decided to give this place a go!    Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix along W Bell Road in the same compound as Caramba, and behind Lamar's Donuts.  If you're not paying attention, you can easily miss the restaurant as it's situated all the way in the back behind Lamar's Donuts.  Thankfully, using our trusty GPS, it told us we arrived.  (-0.25) Parking was plentiful at the side of the restaurant as I thought I spied several parking spaces there.  Parking directly in front of the restaurant has 1-hour wait signs as the restaurant has businesses to the left of it, so if you plan on staying longer, I'd suggest parking at the side.   There were a couple of tables and chairs outside though there wasn't any barrier and offered no privacy from the passing cars and parking lot. (-0.25) The restaurant was well lit; tables/chairs very clean; and floors were equally clean as well.  Noise level wasn't bad. The place was on the small size and felt a bit cramped to me.  If you came with a large party, I guess you could place a couple of tables and chairs together.  (-0.50)  Menus - self-explanatory, and posted right above the serving area as you entered.      Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming.  Any questions we had were answered politely and promptly.  We were even offered samples to try prior to ordering.   I never heard about Carolina slaw (on the menu) and wanted to try it.  Thankfully the staff asked if I'd like to taste it because it's definitely an acquired taste, and it most definitely was!  Very tangy - I guess it's made with vinegar.  Suffice it to say, it was too strong for me and had to pass.  I know...I know...what kind of wuss comes to eat meat and can't handle some vinegar, right?!  Food - My party and I ordered the two-meat platter - two meats, two sides, and a corn muffin.  I had the pulled pork, ribs (I believe they gave me 4), beans, and the creamy coleslaw.   Staff will also ask if you want pickles at the side which amounts to about 4-5 thinly sliced pickles. The pickles weren't tangy but actually sweet, and not too soggy.   The creamy coleslaw was very tasty, fresh, creamy, and not swimming in water.   The beans had a chili taste to it, and was warm and very well seasoned!   The corn muffin unusually had corn baked within it.  This is something I never had and, though unusual, I must say I really liked it.  The corn muffin wasn't too dry, but actually moist. The pulled pork was very moist, tender, and well cooked in the slow cooker!  The ribs too were of the fall-off-the-bone type.  Moist, not too dry, well cooked and well rubbed with their seasonings as well. The ribs and pulled pork was cooked so well that it didn't require any sauces, but for the purposes of this review, I tried the available sauces (by the soda machine) - sweet and spicy.  There were other sauces available for customers.  Both sauces were delicious and the latter wasn't all that spicy in my opinion, though it provided a tiny kick.  Definitely would recommend, and also definitely will be returning!

As a fan of Panera from back on the East coast, I'm really happy they've moved into the West Valley! Thankfully there's one now located at the food court in the Arrowhead Town Center mall. The staff were pleasant, profession, clean, welcoming, answered any questions, and even asked if we wanted a description of the menu items we ordered which they've never done before when we were back on the East coast. Menu can be well seen on the well, and well lit. The surrounding area was clean including the order counter tops. No lines and two cashiers taking orders at the same time made things go smoothly. Food as usual was good, filling, tasty, fresh, and hot! They only lost a star because we asked for one of our orders without the accompanying salt and pepper but it tasted as if it did. (-1)
