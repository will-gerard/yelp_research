Review is long over due.  Marty came out to my house and did a fantastic job and saved me  a few hundred dollars as well.  Pool fence has been up for 3 months and I have zero regrets on using the fence without the self latching gate.  Would definitely use him again.

I'm not sure what happened exactly.  I spoke to Michelle, she came out to my house within a couple days and provided a written estimate the following day.   I responded to her estimate saying I needed one other thing done and that was the last I heard from her.  I have tried emailing, texting and left a voice mail, but no response what so ever.   It's been nearly 2 weeks.  You would think that would be enough time for some sort of response.

Angel from American Home Water just finished installing my new hot water heater and I couldn't be happier about the entire experience. Called them on Sunday to discuss the constant dripping from my hot water heater out of the temperate pressure relief valve.  They told me based on the age of my heater (10 years) it didn't make sense to repair.  Scheduled me for the next day.  Angel called ahead to make sure i was going to be home and then arrived when he said he would (I don't find this to be the case with most companies).  I hate the 2-4 hour window they like to give you). He was efficient and had everything installed within an hour.  Price was excellent (I had been shopping around prior to this happening)and  I rec'd a 5% discount for being a yelp customer.   Will make sure to refer all of my friends and family to them in the future.  Thank you American Home Water for making this such a pleasurable experience!

excellent service once again from AHWA.  Brad came out to my house to service three a/c units.   He also fixed a couple issues without additional charge.  According to Brad, "that's part of the inspection process."  I really appreciate this company putting clients first.  When it comes time to replace my units, I will definitely contact them for the job.  Thank you AHWA!

Wave House Cleaning Service has been cleaning my house for a few months now.   Easy to book appointments and they always do an excellent job.  I have had different cleaning crews at the house, and the results are always same-perfect.  They are excellent with their attention to detail.  They even cleaned the base of my electric toothbrush!  I'm so glad I found them.   Thank you Wave House Cleaning!!

love these guys.   Been using them for about a year now.   They are very flexible and do an awesome job.  Easy to get in touch with as well as schedule or reschedule appointments.  If you have any special requests, they are always taken care of during the cleaning.  I was very impressed with the last service done by their two person crew Richelle and Tiyanna.  House always looks so great.   Look forward to keeping this company for a long time.

CC sunscreens was very easy to work with.  I made a couple different changes on the number of windows I wanted to have covered.  Regardless of my changes they were quick to call me back and to come back out to the house to make additional measurements.  They installed all of the screens within 2 days of me giving them the green light!  I never expected it to be that quick.  Screens look great and they definitely work.  Did I mention I was able to get all of the windows I wanted for about 25% less than the other companies who came out to the house?  Great experience!

very simple--they say what they mean and mean what they say.   Ryan was very thorough looking at several little jobs around my house.   He called me back when he said he was going to and they showed up on time.   Everything was completed in a timely manner for the quoted price.  Will use The Repair Guys again in the future.

I must say I was quite impressed with David and his company.  He came out to my house in Cave Creek at 4:30 and stayed until 7:00.  He provided me with an abundance of information regarding various pests and their habits.   He sprayed my entire front yard, back yard, garage, fence and even the walls around my house to protect me from anything and everything.   I have had 2 other exterminating companies and no one has ever spent as much time on the outside of my home.  He was very mindful of my young son as well as our dogs.  The definitely seem to be all about customer service and doing what is right for the customer.  I will make sure to recommend David and his company to my coworkers, friends and family.   Thank you Arizona Pest Squad.  Look forward to a long happy relationship as well as a pest free home!

just wanted to add an update.  ONce again David from AZ Pest Squad won me over with his outstanding customer service. We played phone tag and he wasn't able to come out originally when scheduled, but in return he gave me a free service.  All I can say is thank you, thank you!!  More companies should follow your example.  Thank yo for the excellent customer experience!!!!

This review is long over due.  Streamline Solar installed solar panels on my roof at the end of last year and I went "live" in January of this year.  Everything has been working great for the last 10 months.  So happy we switched over to solar.  I am saving over $50 per month over the equalized payments I was paying to APS and not having to worry about APS's time of use nonsense.

After reading glowing reviews on Handy Andy I went to his website and emailed him.   Didn't receive a response for a couple days.  I should have stopped right there, but I thought maybe he was busy.  Tried to leave him a voice mail, but wasn't able because the mailbox was full. Should have stopped there, but again thought maybe he was busy.   Got in touch with Andy on the phone a few days later and scheduled an appt for Saturday at 10:00.   AT 10:30, no show so I gave him a text and he said he was on his way.   It's now 12:30, no show, no call, no text return (sent him another text for an ETA).   What a waste of time!   Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this individual.    If you read through the reviews you will see that I am not the only one who received such crappy service.   Thanks for nothing.
