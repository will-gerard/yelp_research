I have been here plenty of times and this has to be not only the worst experience but the worst review I will probably write. Our cook flung food and eggs at my husband by mistake and also lit the chopsticks on a plate on fire. Said both times "well that's the first time ever." Our table was me and my husband and another family. No appetizers or sushi came out until we asked to cancel it. The waitress then canceled it said "well it's free sushi do you want it or I will throw it out?" The family at our table took theirs and it smelled so once saying that they weren't going to eat it she then said "it's free so take it home and feed it to your cat." Not only was the manager not willing to step in after that but she got all of the receipts wrong and was just continuously rude until we all left. This is sad to say since the chef cooked the food too perfection that me and my husband will never be back ever again.

I went here last minute and they were amazing! They were very fast and really friendly! I was in and out in less than 10 minutes! It's nice to have everything kinda done for your! I would totally go back if I had to!

They greeted us right away. Asked if we were new or returning. The first girl explained it all to us, our cashier was fun. Liked how they said to have a "smiley" day which makes you smile. Love that they have a rewards program. Only wish when it came time for yogurt choices they had more in the fruit flavor. But was great!
