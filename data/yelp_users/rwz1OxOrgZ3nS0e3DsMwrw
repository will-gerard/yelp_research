I wish I could actually give some feedback on a massage here, but after buying a Groupon and trying several times to contact the spa, I never received a call back or email reply.  I get that rapid increase in business is not always the easiest to manage, but there was plenty of lead time and I provided several ways to contact me back.  This place will never get their hands on me or my money and I hope this review is lesson to the company and warning to potential customers.

My family and I had dinner at Phoenix Public Market Cafe last night.  The food was phenomal, as always, and the atmosphere was very urban and chic.  We ordered several items off the menu and shared amongst ourselves.  The burger and the Del Real sandwich tied for tops on our list, followed closely by the open-faced peanut butter sandwich and the salmon with black beans.  To top it off, they have several pastry items and signature drinks to help wash it all down.  The combination of the bar, patio, bakery, dining area and farmers market will keep Phoenix Public Market Cafe busy for a very long time.  Aaron Chamberlin and company hit a home run with St. Francis, but they knocked it out of the stadium with Phoenix Public Market Cafe!!!  I look forward to many more meals and frosty beverages at this wonderful establishment.
