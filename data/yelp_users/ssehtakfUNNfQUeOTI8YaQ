These hamburgers taste like McDonald's burgers, however, are way overpriced (for the quality). I will not waste my money, here, again. Instead, I'll stick to gourmet burgers like those served at Deluxe or Blue Burger.

Host service was horrific! When asked what the wait was, I was advised, "I don't know". This happened on two separate visits (the 1st I immediately walked out on).  Server was amazing! Knowledgeable, enthusiastic about the beer, prompt, and friendly.  Beer was ok and food was NOT good! Had the fries with beer cheese and pulled pork, as well as meatloaf sliders (salty and hard).  I will not be back.

Had the Rania gyro...it was amazing! Love the condiments/sauces, too! This will soon be one of my favorite go to places, I can see it already!
