OMG, I found the most amazing,  absolutely unique and profound Chiropractor- Dr. Jesper Reib.  One of my friend recommended him. In an hour he fixed my shoulder problem - pain, acid reflex and lower back problem , which I had for 18 years, after I broke my back. Highly recommend him to everyone. He is a Dr.Miracle:) With joy,  Helena K

Dr Jesper Reib is  a miracle . He is the best, as he uses Qi gong and energy healing as well. He cleared my lover back from 17 years old trauma. Highly recommend to everyone . With joy and appreciation,  Helena K

The worse experience in my life. The girl who did pedicure for me, didn't put any moisturizer on my feet, cut my heels. I payed $35 for the pedi. I can't normally walk.  When I talked to the owner after few days, she just ignored me.  Never, ever will use this spa and would never recommend to any one. Helena K

Dr. Moore is the best dentist in my life. She knows what she does  and does her job so profoundly and with zero pain. She is so sweet and kind and not expensive. I am soooo happy that my friend recommended her.  If you are looking for the best dentist in Phoenix -Scottsdale try Dr. Moore . Helena Kaz
