My family & I have been going to Dr Reed for years. He is a great dentist & his staff is top notch!!   I think people who use groupons for health care deals are reaching if they think they are getting something for free... It's more of a discount on the first encounter & great marketing to get your name out. They are good for cosmetic whitening. Most people who go every 6 months regular cleanings is not going to use a groupon so it's being purchased by people who have not been in years & upkeep has been neglected.

This place is amazing!!! I used to eat the original cakes from Las Vegas where it all began... and these cakes are just as good as the original maybe even better!! I get one every Birthday, anniversary or any occasion (excuse) to get one!! Impress a friend or coworker and get them as gifts!! The cakes are unforgettable!!

My husband lost his glasses yesterday & he needed glasses ASAP. We called them with the Rx in hand & they were done in an hour!! They look great & my husband is happy. Could not ask for better customer service. They have many frames to choose from. I highly recommend Len Crafters @ City North.

Says on Yelp open till 10pm. Stood at the front door for over 5 mins to have someone come out and tell us they closed the kitchen down at 9pm tonight. It was 9:05!!  Won't be returning again. Too many other businesses in the area. Not cool.

This was our first time here & we were impressed. Kendal's service was outstanding! The food was amazing... We ordered a bottle of wine & received the cheese plate for free. The cheese plate was the best mix of cheeses we've ever had. There is this pear/horseradish spread that is out of this world. My husband & I just went wheat free & all the dishes are labeled GF & V.  Corn meal trout &  southern risotto (featured in this months Phx Mag) were both very tasty & I would highly recommend. We will definitely be back.

I hate places on Yelp that say they are "open" & they have a late night menu cause the kitchen is closed. Really... Waste of time, Not coming back.

Had lunch here today. The food was great. Interesting take on southern comfort food. My husband got biscuit & gravy and gumbo. They were both amazing. The chicken & biscuit had  an Asian twist, served stew like. Gumbo was amazing with andouille sausage.  For dessert we had beignets. They were almost as good cafe du monde.  Perfect ending to a great meal. Lunch menu is much smaller than the dinner menu. Will go back to try dinner next time.
