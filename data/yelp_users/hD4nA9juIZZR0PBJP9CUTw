Outstanding service. They got it done much faster than expected, and did a very nice job with it. These guys go above and beyond.

There is not another minister in the same league as Phil, and his associates are carefully hand-picked - truly the cream of the crop. His words are finely crafted and his presence is refreshing.

If you are looking for a personalized, tasteful, romantic reception that becomes a rockin dance party - go with All-American DJ. My wife and I film weddings and have worked with them a lot, and the people have so much fun; we even notice it later when editing the video.

Aldea is a wonderful private, yet spacious location to marry. My wife and I have the opportunity to film weddings here now and then and love the way they treat both the couple and the vendors. The couples seem to have so much fun in the midst of warm and elegant surroundings. They give their vows with beautiful surroundings and hear toasts in the grand ballroom.

They did good by me. It's great to have them in the neighborhood. I appreciate their friendly and competent approach. My car appreciates it too!

My wife and I worked with Jimmy at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale. His timing is spot on, and he kept a fun loving and smooth atmosphere the whole night. I would highly recommend Starz Entertainment.

I'm just not into food that tastes like plastic. It was a cheap experience overall, but the food is not good.

These guys are straight shooters and charge very little. After the job I told both of my neighbors about it and they both had worked with Thunderbird and both said the same thing!!! They've got something going there.

This Dennys is my favorite. They have a great location, great food and great management. I've been coming here for many years, and they remain outstanding and consistant. I hope they are around for many years to come.

I cannot believe how may mail items this post office has LOST. Something is seriously wrong with this place! The facility is nice, but what does it matter if they lose 15% of the letters you try to mail. This place needs an investigation.

Got You Covered does it right. My wife and I get to work with them often as videographers, so we see them DJ a lot. They work hard for their clients and do it with style and excellent timing. They provide us timelines and are just easy to work with. Both my wife and I would highly recommend them.

They always do a great job for us. Great pizza and an attentive staff. Their options are great too. This app says my review is too short, so I'm making it a little bit longer. It's just pizza, but sooooooooooo good.

My gosh, what a cool person. Lisa's shots are amazing, and she works hard to get them. We have the opportunity to work with Lisa occasionally, and truly enjoy her spirit. Her creativity is strong in any situation, which is nice because she is never at a loss for the next epic photo. Both my wife and I would highly recommend her to anyone in need of a great photographer.

Jason and Kerri are on it. They are also the DJs you get, as they maintain quality control by staying small -- VERY important. We've worked with them many times as fellow wedding vendors. They are just spectacular, and Jason has THE BEST DJ voice in Arizona. You've probably heard him, in fact, as he is the voice for traffic updates on most radio channels. Their equipment is top notch. Their timing is spot on. They have great smiles. -- Yeah, go with them.

Rick is the guy you want to spearhead almost any event. He can get you what you need and his execution is flawless. He has an infectious, winsome smile along with the expertise to think of everything. I highly recommend the Production Pros.

My wife and I had the opportunity to film video while Melissa Jill shot photos, and from a vendor's perspective she is a delight. She has carefully selected assistants who are top notch photographers in their own right. She is also very involved in the community, and has strong integrity, which we appreciate. She is highly in demand, so I wouldn't wait long before calling her. Her work speaks for itself, but her personality is just as impressive. Her work ethic is strong, and we fully recommend her.

My gosh. Thad is amazing. His work ethic is unmatched. He was even patient with our yip dog. (Ug!) He really saved the day for us. He gave us an new AC system and got everything working. He even came back to make sure everything was working correctly.   Thad is the most helpful guy as well. To make sure we had AC restored he worked almost 12 hours straight! ...Up in our very hot, stuffy attic!  Definitely give Thad a call.
