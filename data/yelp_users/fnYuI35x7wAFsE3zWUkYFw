Ooh la la!  I came here for a quick bite before getting on a plane.  The atmosphere is really cool - nice outdoor seating area, high tables, low tables, and a couple of booths tucked away.  The service was also very pleasant, with the waitress both attentive and friendly.  As for the food, I went for the bruschetta.  It's about $13 for four pieces, and I thought that it would be four small toast rounds.  Boy was I wrong - it's a meal in itself.  Each bruschetta is about the size of a hand and cut into four manageable strips.  I tried the tomato/mozzarella/basil (my usual standby), brie/apple/fig and ricotta/dates/pistachio.  Although I was afraid of the more "adventurous" ones, I wound up liking the ricotta and brie bruschetta even more than the tomato/mozzarella one, which totally held its own.  The quality of the food was great and the combinations were somewhat inventive but also worked really well together.    If I'm ever back in Phoenix I'll make sure to visit this location (or its other outpost where a buddy of mine saw the McCains).

After watching Top Chef Masters, we really wanted to check out a Hubert Keller restaurant but didn't feel like we could splurge at Fleur de Lys.  So Burger Bar it was.  We went around 8:30 on a Saturday night and it took about 40 minutes to be seated (they give you pagers so you can shop in the area if you'd like).  J ordered the Blackjack burger (with Tapenade) and I got the hot dog sausage (Hebrew National!) although I couldn't have the sauerkraut because it had bacon in it.  The burgers/dogs was really good and the fries were great too.  We didn't try any desserts but they seemed interesting enough.  Now all i got to do is save my pennies and make a trip to San Fran....

We wanted to go to Bouchon for brunch and got there about 10 minutes after they stopped seating.  We had about an hour and a half to eat and get back to the hotel for check-out, and this place had eggs on the menu (although it was the lunch menu).  It's owned by Cheesecake Factory, so if you want to know what to expect, then go to your local Cheesecake Factory and order your usual.  I found the eggs to be too greasy and J's sandwich was mediocre at best.  The waitress who took our order was impossible to track down, and we almost missed check-out because it took over 1/2 an hour to get our food (the table next to us ordered later and got their stuff on time).  I guess the place is okay, the service not so much, but with so many other options, why go to a more pricey version of Cheesecake Factory?

I was told to check out this buffet while in Vegas, and I kind of regret I did.  I think there are two types of people: those who like buffets and those who don't.  I'm of the latter sort, and buffets remind me of eating in college mess halls more than enjoying the food.  But still, we went here for a Saturday brunch.    The variety seemed pretty good - asian, italian, seafood, pizza, breakfast, etc.  I had an omelet which was probably the highlight of the meal.  Everything else that I tried was fine, but I was definitely limited by not being able to have the meat here.  The desserts looked nice but I didn't really like any of the ones I tried.  My fiance was more experimental, but he thought that most of the food was kind of pedestrian or mediocre.  Ultimately, both of us would have preferred eating less at a better restaurant in Vegas, but then again, I guess we're not buffet people.

I used priceline to get a room here because we wanted to go to Vegas without staying in a hotel/casino.  I had read that if you "name your own price" and lowball it, you'll almost always get Trump, so I was happy I took this route.  We had the studio with the "bad" view because we didn't want to pay to upgrade and weren't savvy enough to try the $20 trick.  Note: if you want to upgrade the traditional way, it's $25/night for a better view and $50/night for a 1 bedroom.  The resort fees were $15/day and while you used to have to pay a $22/day surcharge for gym and $14/day surcharge for overnight parking, both of these are no more.  The studio was pretty spacious (mind you, this is my first time going to Vegas so I'm not able to compare it to any other hotels).  Most importantly, it was extremely clean.  When we decided to go away for the weekend, we heard about dirty Vegas hotels and wanted to stay away from these... so we were relieved that everything was spotless.  There was a hot plate and mini-fridge, as well as a microwave and some cookware, but we didn't use any of these.  The bed is really comfy though I think as others pointed out, the mattress is considerably smaller than the bed frame.  The bathroom is flipping awesome... maybe it's because I have a cramped bathroom at home, but first off - there's a giant jacuzzi and a giant shower - both of which are separate.  The bathroom is the size of the dorm room I had in college.  And the robes that you can use are really comfy too.  The pool is fine - I doubt that it's as flashy as most Vegas pools but it was perfectly okay by us.  Lots of people drinking in there, but also a lot of kids.  This seemed to be one of the more family-friendly hotels, since you don't need to walk through a casino to get to the rooms nor are you inhaling second-hand smoke 24/7.  The smoke-free environment was a big plus for us, as was having no casino.    The location is off the strip, but it was about a 5-minute walk from the Wynn.  There is also a free shuttle to TI that runs every 15 minutes, btu we just walked to the strip and took the bus to get to places like Mandalay Bay.  During the day, you can cut through Fashion Show Mall to get to the strip if the heat/lack of a good pedestrian environment (i.e., sidewalks) gets to you.  There were plenty of cabs at the entrance, but we didn't want to pay an absurd amount to travel in 1/12 mile increments.    The staff was all friendly and accommodating.  We checked in just after noon on Friday and did the 4pm late checkout, which was really nice because we were able to make a few last stops before hitting the road.  If we ever visit Vegas again, we plan on staying here again!

I had to go to Phoenix and was looking for an affordable hotel near downtown.  The Wyndham had a special on Suns game nights, with a rate of $79/night.  A step up from Motel 6 and way cheaper than the Sheraton, so I booked it.  I arrived around 10pm and there weren't many people in the lobby (which is quite swanky, by the way).  However, their machines were down and they had to hand-write all of my information to check in.  No problem, even though it took a little while.  They gave me a key and I headed upstairs.  Let's just say that whatever renovations they've done do not include the hallways.  The ceilings are very low and everything just looks really drab and dated.  I get to the door, put in my key card, and no dice.  Call downstairs and they say they'll send someone up.  Well, five minutes later the security guy comes in and keys me into my room but I still have to go downstairs to get a new key.  I got one of the renovated rooms, which looks nice with the same polka-dot and square motif as the lobby.  Nice big headboard and peppy green wallpaper in the bathroom.  But... the TV doesn't work.  And then I try calling an 800 number to change my flight and the in room phone doesn't work.  That eventually got resolved but I couldn't really take advantage of anything in the room except the bed...  And the bed was comfortable.  I could have gotten a good night sleep.  Except that at 5am I start hearing a conversation.  Like really loudly, as if there is a group of four people talking right in my ear.  I realized that the room adjacent to mine had a group of girls who were getting ready and the soundproofing was so bad that I could hear every single word.  When I checked out the concierge asked me how my stay was and I noted this.  He said that after renovations they've realized that there are some soundproofing issues because they replaced parts of carpeting with tile and also left larger gaps under the door.    Also, the water pressure in the shower was mediocre but worse, I couldn't get the water hotter than "slightly above luke warm."  On top of that, most of the staff that I encountered (between check-in, changing my key, checking out, etc.) were rather unfriendly.  So nice lobby and aesthetically pleasing rooms.  But if you want to do what you came to the hotel for - i.e., sleep - then go elsewhere.
