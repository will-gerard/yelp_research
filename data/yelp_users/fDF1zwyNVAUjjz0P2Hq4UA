This place is a joke and I will never stay here again. I made the reservation online for the rate of $55 a night. When I got there to check in the total was $172 and when I asked why I was told there was a $100 deposit (even tho I had a credit card) and the discount would be applied upon check out. It didn't make sense to me and the more I tried to understand and inquire the bigger the attitude got. The front desk staff was rude and obviously had no clue how to properly operate a hotel which was proven when I went to the room and there was already someone in it. I had to wait for the employees to figure out what was available and what wasn't. I asked for a bar of soap and was told to get it out of the vending machine. In the middle of the night I got cold and turned the heater on which set off the smoke alarm. The front desk would come to my room everytime it happened and tell me to shut it off. Who cares that I am freezing cold I guess. The next day starting at 940 the staff was calling and bugging me about checking out. I told them I would be out by 11, which is check out time and of course got major attitude. I should have been used to the crappy attitude by that time cuz that's all I got the entire time. I went to the front desk to check out and the same rude lady that checked me in (guess no one else works there which might explain the rudeness) looked at me then proceeded outside to smoke a cigarette. I waited not so patiently standing at the front desk until she came back to check out. I was reluctantly given my refund back but not the money for the rate difference. I asked her and she said that should have been handled at check in and there was nothing that could be done now. I was steaming mad and all she said was "call corporate office if you don't like it." Wow!! Never again!!

Needed a place to stay while my condo had some major work done so looked online and found this place to be the best deal. The rates are more expensive if book thru the hotel website but really reasonable if you book they hotels.com.  I was pleasantly surprised when i arrived. The place is great. The rooms were clean and spacious. The property was beautiful and  kept up nicely. The bed was so comfortable but didn't have a comforter or bedspread. They have a nice pool and jacuzzi, both have electric chair lifts which I've never seen at a hotel. The staff was friendly. The breakfast was good and they even had karaoke in the evening.  As a explored the place i thought it would be the perfect place to have a wedding. The flowers and trees were alive and healthy and the numerous water fountains were the perfect touch.  The only bad thing I found was the soda machine didn't take coins, there wasn't a list of channels in the room, and all of the rooms were non smoking.  I will definitely stay here again and if I ever get married this place is where it'll be.

Stopped here to get dinner for the family cuz Long John Silvers has always been a favorite of mine. I was suprised to find it wasn't busy. The store was clean, the staff was friendly & helpful, and the food was prepared quickly. When the guy brought me my food he asked if I wanted sauce and I said yes some of everything. When I got home and looked in the bags I was disappointed to find no Tartar sauce, no malt vinegar,  and a whole bunch of ketchup.  :(  Then I discovered  the next disappointment when I started eating the food. I sure do remember the fish pieces being alot bigger. The onion rings were not very good, the hush puppies weren't cooked all the way,  and the fries were soggy! Not that it mattered really cuz I wont eat any of it without malt vinegar!  Ugh! What a waste of $45.

Great place to get tires! I dropped in to have a tire replaced and was greeted by a friendly staff member immediately.  They had me in and out with a new tire within 15 minutes. The price I paid was the lowest Ive ever paid!  I highly recommend Joe's Tire Shop.

I got a flyer on my door so I thought I'd give them a try. I was really surprised when I called and the girl who answered spoke fluent English which is a plus. She was a little rude but I dealt with it. I placed my order and waited for the delivery... and waited... and waited... almost 2 hours later it was delivered. The price that I was told on the phone was less then what the delivery driver tried to collect from me.  Aside from the rude order taker, the price difference, and the delivery time the food sucked! The sweet and sour pork was soggy, the rice was hard, and the beef was like leather.  The best thing and only good thing about this place was the egg rolls... they were better then most places.

The only 24 hour pediatric urgent care in the east valley was Good Night Pediatrics was a definate plus. Other then that there's not anything too positive to say about the place.  The guy at the front desk couldn't have been any ruder. He never even looked up at us.  The doctor was ok I guess. I thought she was nice but my son was scared of her and she made no effort to ease his mind or calm him. She acted like I was a complete idiot or liar but did it with a smile.  We didn't have to wait long to get put into a room and once in the room the doctor came right in.

I come to this pharmacy often, not by choice. The prescription for my son can only be filled here if I want my insurance to pay for it. So every other week I'm forced to reserve time I don't really have available to go stand in a long line to deal with stupid employees that can never seem to get anything right and to top it off they all have attitudes. Their prices are high and the employees are rude. The only good thing about this place is the cleanliness... its always clean and organized.

My company had a party here so I rented a room so I wouldn't have to drive after I'd been drinking.   PROS: Cheap rates, easy online booking, friendly staff, nice rooms, 24 hour fitness center, refreshing cucumber water in lobby, they hand deliver any necessities you may have forgotten at home (such as toothpaste)  and the staff is fast to respond to any questions or concerns.  CONS: Pool closes early, room service has hidden fees that aren't disclosed up front, staff unfamiliar with layout of resort, and the free breakfast they offer as part of the room rate is for kids which they don't mention until you order.

I have taken my kids here many times and have never had a experience that was anything other then excellent.   PROS:  * I have never had to wait more then 10-15 minutes for my child to be seen. * Usually were in & out within 30 minutes. * The staff is very nice & have always treated us with respect. * The doctors actually listen & care about their patients. * The place is fairly clean both in waiting & treatment/exam room. * It's conveniently located.   CONS:  * They don't stay open late.  * The exam rooms could be better decorated for, anything would be an improvement.    So you can see that the cons are very few and meaningless. I highly recommend All Kids Urgent Care (previously named Cornerstone Pediatrics) to any family with a sick child!!

The kids & I decided to have a picnic at Papago Park. While there we felt adventurous and decided to check out the hole in the rock. What a perfect spot for a beginner hiker who's out of shape and really isn't into hiking. Ha-ha!    From the front it looks like a difficult rock to climb and I didn't even want to try. But then I realized there was a path up the back that was easy to hike. Me and my son did it in sandals!  So now I can say that I hike! !

I took my 3 year old son to Fantastic Sam's for a haircut and I can't say Ill ever go back.   POSITIVES:  It was reasonably priced.  There was no wait.  They gave out free lollipops and a token for the prize machine.  The staff was semi friendly.  It didn't take long to complete the hair cut.   NEGATIVES: The staff was only semi friendly. The end results were a good reason that the prices are so low and why there was no wait. The stylist (if that's what you want to call the lady with scissors)  had no clue what she was doing. I'm thinking she completed beauty school thru correspondence courses.    Definately wont go back again!

I had a tire blow out on the freeway and had no spare. After calling a few tow companies I knew I needed to make a choice quickly so I chose Save Money Towing for no other reason then they happen to answer the call and had a pleasant attitude. I am glad I did! Richard answered the phone and was extremely helpful in every way possible. He was also the one that showed up to tow my car, which is a plus cuz he already knew the situation rather then having someone show up that's clueless.  He brought a spare tire that fit and waited patiently for me to get there. Unfortunately I had to send someone in my place but Richard was very understanding and tolerated the confusion and chaos. He was quick to get my car drivable and kept me informed every step of the way. When it was all said and done I owed him money that he let me pay the next day. This tow company is excellent and I will for sure use them in the future if needed!  They are helpful, honest, and reasonably priced!!

My 2 year old autistic son was sent to ValleyENT by his pediatrician to have tubes put in his ears.  We called on a Tuesday and got to see the doctor the same day. The staff was kind of snobby but it wasn't too bad.  The waiting room has a big playground right in the middle! How awesome is that?! The wait wasn't very long to see the doctor. Dr. Chuang is who my son saw and he was wonderful. He was friendly and explained everything in terms I understood and answered all questions I had. We were scheduled for surgery that Friday.  The surgery to put tubes in was quick easy and almost painless.  To make a long story short...maybe its too late for that... I would recommend ValleyENT to anyone, old or young.

I debated on a 2 or 3 star review and you can see what it ended up being...  I've heard so much over the years about Zoo Lights and was really excited to finally go. Here's the goods and bads of the Phoenix Zoo Lights...  POSITIVE: It had lights. It was outside. You go at your own pace. Some of the light set ups were pretty cool. There was a talking giraffe that you could interact with. There was a light show to music above the water. SRP gave out buy 1 get 1 free coupons.   NEGATIVE: It costs $13 a person. The line to buy tickets was rediculiously long and slow moving. The line to get in was just as bad. The lights are ok but nothing like its made out to be and there aren't nearly as many as it seems. The trail you follow isn't very long meaning the exhibit wasn't very big. The amount of money they charge 1 person for a snack is more then you could feed a whole family dinner. The employees are rude and obviously aren't the "people person" type. The slide, caresuell, zip line, and camal rides costs extra. There is not one real animal in sight.   To sum it up the experience was highly over rated, over priced and over populated! I'm glad I went so I can say "been there, done that" but Im not sure which is worse... the amount of money the adventure costed or the horrible disappointment I felt when it was over!

After a bad experience at a different pediatric dentist I was reluctant to take my 2 year old autistic son to another dentist but he badly needed dental work so I searched until I found 1 I was comfortable with which happened to be Kidtastic Dental (used to be called Fiesta Dental) on Longmore Rd in Mesa. I called on a Monday but they aren't open so I called back Tuesday morning and they got my son in that same day. The office staff was friendly, the place was clean, and there wasn't a long wait once we arrived. The dentist was extremely nice and was very informative about everything. He decided that in order to finish the dental treatment my son would have to be put to sleep. The only negative thing about the whole experience was the amount of time we had to wait before they could finish his treatment which was over a month. But once the time came for my son to b put to sleep it was a quick and easy process where everyone worked together to make things run smoothly. They doctor as well as the anesthesiologist were really nice and helped ease any concerns I had. They kept me well informed thru the whole process and focused all their attention on the safety and comfort of my son.  To sum it up the experience was as good as a kids dental experience could be. I highly recommend this place!!

Tonight is my sons first homecoming dance and he's taking his little girlfriend. Now I didn't realize a week ago when he told me they were going that getting a corsage is not as easy as running into the store in grabbing one off the shelf. Apparently you have to preorder them and have them specially made. Oops... I also learned that about 20 other people made the same assumption as I did therefore needing one miraculiously  today. I drove all over town before finding Flowerama who was able to get one made today. What a relief.  So I paid $24.99 and it was done in less then 2 hours.  The ladies were very nice, the price was reasobable, and the coraage was lovely. Ill definately be a return customer.

I was at the dollar store when approached by some kid that was dressed nice and pushy wanting me to have pictures taken. It was only $10 so I said why not. He scheduled an appointment for the next Saturday at the store I was shopping at. Kind of odd cuz I didn't know there was a portrait studio hidden in the store. Haha.  So I spent the next 5 days preparing for the pictures. made my 4 boys get haircuts and bought us all new shirts.  We showed up at our assigned time and asked a store employee where the picture place was and they pointed towards the back of the store. We looked all over but still couldn't find it. Well come to find out the picture studio was a traveling set up which was taking pictures in the fricken bathroom of the dirty dollar store.  OMG!   After a 30 min wait it was our turn so we picked a background and paid another $6 for the sitting fee. The camera guy, notice I didn't say photographer, was nothing more then a young kid with a cheap camera who was probably promoted from the position of the person  that originally approached me for having the most sales the month before. After we were done he assigned us an appointment in 3 weeks to pick up our photos.  I showed up on the day and time scheduled and no1 was there from the photo place and none of the dollar store employees knew what I was talking about. They must have thought I was some crazy lady askig about pictures taken in the bathroom. I called the phone number listed on the paper I had but only got voicemail.  I was mad.  The next day I get a call from the pic place telling me I was supposed to be there to pick up the photos.   To skip to the point ... I met with a person who wanted to charge me five hundred dollars for some stupid picture pacakge. I took my photos and got the hell out of there before someone else tried to scam me into something rediculious.

My children's father got pulled over, arrested,  and got his car impounded on Xmas Eve. He had the kids presents in the trunk. All City Towing was the tow company that the city of Mesa uses to tow and store vehicles. I went down to the impound lot, (which was a pain in the neck to find cuz noone wanted to disclose the location) to get the gifts. All the office staff were so snotty and rude. I waited at least 30 minutes for some young kid to escort me to the car, who was very nice except for him hovering over me like a volture over dead animals. I was able to get everything I needed out & was escorted off of the property.  All City Towing is not as dirt bagy as some other tow companies but the office people definitely could use some customer service training.

I did the online check in and preregistered before coming in and showed up at my assigned time but that was a joke and a waste of time. I was told by the very rude front desk lady that they don't pay any attention to that option and was offended when I suggested somebody should remove that option from their website.  Anyhow I sat down in the waiting room where there was two TV's turned on one of them was playing Spanish soap operas and was a pretty loud (apparently she wasnt going to miss her soap operas by being at work) and the other was English news but was muted. That was pretty annoying due to the fact the only people in the waiting room spoke English. While waiting a guy came in and was upset that he was given the wrong prescription.  The rest of my visit was just as pleasant as the first part. They didn't have an actual doctor on site. They lack communication from one staff member to another is nonexistant. The physicians assistant doesnt take the time to listen and the diagnosis reflects such.

I decIded to update my revIew because after submitting my previous review the manager contacted me to let me know they had read the review. The manager wanted to explain the reasons for why they choose to do things the way they do. In all fairness I have to say that I understand now why the beds are all stand up and why they don't offer towels like other tanning salons... hygeine concerns. I also noticed that they did add chairs to each room.  I think its awesome that they not only took the time to read my review but responded to it and then to top it off fixed some of the things I complained about!!

I got a card from a friend of mine for a week free tanning so I decided to check it out.   POSITIVE: free week, no time limit before the beds turn on, cheap rates after your free week, no sign up fees, no contracts, cheap priced lotions, management actually listens to customers suggestions then acts on it, decent beds, opens early, closes late, and is conveniently located.   NEGATIVES: don't accept cash at all, only have stand up beds (OK for sanitation reasons but not OK for lazy reasons), and some of the staff are a little snotty.   I would highly recommend TanMax to anyone cuz the good out weights the bad by far.
