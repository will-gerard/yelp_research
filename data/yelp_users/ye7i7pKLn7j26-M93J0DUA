Good Thai food is hard to find.  You've found it here!  I went here for lunch today and was blown away. I feel like I've been to so many places around the valley and just haven't found one that I like. I found this place on a whim and decided to try it out. I'm vegan so it's hard for me to find places where I can eat anything. This place had multiple options and everything I tasted was good. I had the Tofu Veggie Pansang. It was delightfully spicy and the tofu was cooked perfectly. My friend had the pad thai and was equally as impressed.  They had good lunch specials and delicious Iced Tea.  I will be going back here again.

Let me preface this review:  I live a healthy lifestyle, exercise regularly, don't smoke and rarely drink.    I rarely go to the doctor and visiting this practice reminded me why. I came in because I've been having trouble sleeping. I made an appointment with KATE MONTGOMERY , RN, CS, FNP.  All I can say is WOW, I've never felt so judged in my life! She was down right rude! Canceled all my remaining appointments They also charge some BS annual fee not covered by insurance.   I will finding another Doctor that is not so judgmental. If I were you, I would pass on this facility.

I have been wanting to come to The Mission for so long,  and I'm so happy I finally made it.  My boyfriend and I came for our three year anniversary. We were treated like royalty. Greeted by the hostess with a friendly "happy anniversary! " she seated us right away on the back patio. The patio was  romantic, strung tastefully with clear lights,  lush greenery, and a charming fountain.   Our server came to greet us immediately. I was incredibly impressed with how much knowledge our server had about the menu(looks like a foreign language) and his ability to help me understand what everything was and what it would taste like. Looking over the drink menu there are so many great options, but I had to try their avocado margarita. Who knew avocados and tequila could go so well together!?  I had the tostadas to start; three crunchy delicious tostadas with all kinds of cheese, chicken, and yummy sauce. I had the salmon for my main entr√©e, I've never had a better cooked piece of fish. Our server was always available to answer questions and always kept our waters and cocktails full.  All I can say is thank you to the entire staff of The Mission for creating such a memorable night for me and my hunny. We can't wait to be back!

Service was great, but the food was terrible. This is one of those places that can make you never like sushi again. YUCK! Stay away!

AMAZING!  I've never had a bad experience here. This is my absolute favorite place in Old Town. Chopped salad is amazing! My favs are the scallops and the chopped salad. The bartenders are nothing short of superb so order a crazy drink, it's bound to be good!

I have no idea what the lady below me is talking about. To be frank, im offended by what she said about Brooklyn  I have been going to Brooklyn every three weeks for 2 years and I adore her!  I am naturally a very dark brunette and she keeps me platinum blonde. I have gotten my hair cut numerous times through her and always love my cut. She is reasonably priced and has a great personality. I will NEVER switch stylists!

Disappointed.   I came here on a Saturday night for dinner. There was a live band that took nearly our entire meal to set up. They were testing their equipment and the sound the entire time we were there. While they were setting up, the restaurant was trying to hide how loud the band was by blaring loud music overhead. I do like loud music, just not blaring like we're at Axis/Radius while I'm eating.   The service was ok. The drinks took longer than our appetizers. They didn't even have enough shrimp to fill our one order of coconut shrimp. I had to get up and get my own salt and pepper from the bar after not seeing my server for nearly 15 mins after our entrees arrived.   The food was AWFUL! I ordered the salmon and my boyfriend some handmade pasta Alfredo dish. Mine was just salmon and couscous. Nothing special and bland. The dish wasn't seasoned. My boyfriend had the same problem with his food, bland. Right after we left I felt sick after eating the little bit of food I did consume.   To top off our "super great" experience we were overcharged for our wine on the bill. At this point we were far too annoyed to say anything and just paid the overage and left. I think its safe to say we wont be coming  back. Such a shame too, considering we've been looking for a great new place. Stay clear of this overpriced gross food. You would be much happier with basically any other restaurant in Old Town.

It pains me to do this, but it must be said.  This place has gone down the drain.   When it first opened I came here often and loved the videos of the plants growing on the screens, the food and the friendly service. I used to take many of my clients out here just so they could soak in the vibe.   I've been here a few times within the past few months and each time my experience gets worse. Today really took the cake.  I came in to order for take out. The place wasn't busy and I even got a parking spot out front! I put 20 minutes on the meter not imaging how my regular order of the Roosevelt which is basically avocado on toast could take any longer.   I placed my order and waited, and waited and waited and waited.   37 minutes after the transaction time on my receipt my to go order comes out. The girl who handed it to me was incredibly rude and the box of food was wide open!   To really sprinkle the sugar on top I walked outside to discover that not only did I get terrible service and wait forever, I had also received a parking ticket!   I will not be returning here. There are too many other new places in downtown that make quality food, offer good service and can put a takeout order out in less than 40 minutes.

I've just discovered my new favorite breakfast locale!   I had the bangkok bloody mary and the snooze breakfast burrito.  The bloody mary: It was great! I love bloody mary's that are spiced with Siracha. They add crushed red pepper to the rim of the glass. That was a cool delicious add on.   The breakfast burrito: Wow! So good. I will say, that I customized it. I had them do egg whites, avocado inside, no cheese and sauce on the side. Tons of moderations and they got everything correct! The black beans in the burrito are purred which is delicious.   What a great little breakfast place. Good food, good drinks, good patio.....a win in my book.

My favorite place in Phoenix.   Chris makes the most amazing cocktails in the city. Just tell him what you like and poof! He'll make  you something delicious.   As for the food, also amazing and unique. Ask for the special because it usually rocks.   I never get tired of going here as it is the best restaurant in Phoenix!

I booked my appointment for Monday April 6th last week. It is currently Thursday April 9th and no one has come to my house. I've followed up with them every single day and now my pool is turning green.   DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!!

This past weekend I had to move. It happened to be a Saturday and March 1st. I was having trouble finding movers at a reasonable price that had decent reviews online.  I came across A To Z Valley Wide Movers and I am so lucky I did.   The guys who moved my house showed up 15 minutes early. It was basically like torrential downpour which is super rare in Phoenix. These guys didn't care and were ready to go. Great positive attitudes!  They were careful with my things and worked fast. We were able to move everything in one load and  finished in 2 hours.   I was really nervous and stressed out about moving. I just want to say a big thank you for helping me out and taking such good care of my belongings.   I will def be referring anyone I can to you.   Thank you!

The only reason I was able to give Ocotillo two stars is because the food and drinks are delicious.   Let's jump right into the reason for the poor rating, my boyfriend found a piece of GLASS the size of a pea in his cocktail.   Following finding the piece of glass in his cocktail, I immediately got up and went straight to the bar. I explained to the bartender how scary this is and if he would've swallowed it he could've died. I mean, it was a chunk of GLASS! She offered him a free drink and no apology...um what....  I told her I'd like to speak to the manager. She didn't realize I was following her as she went to find her manager. My shoes were a bit tall so I was about 15-30 seconds behind her. When I walked up, she was mocking me and doing a full on impression of me verbatim of what I said directly to her manager. I've never felt so disrespected. I don't feel like I was out of line for calling out a giant piece of glass in a drink. As she was talking smack about me, I kindly interjected, "I'm standing right behind you." She looked mortified. At this point she stormed off.   The manager agreed with me this was a big deal and took care of our tab. Mind you, I would've been more than happy to pay my tab if my boyfriend wouldn't have almost swallowed a piece of glass. I've been to this restaurant many times, have never complained and had a wonderful experience.  It gets worse though! I went back to my table, which was a group of 13 and also positioned right next to the bar this girl is working at. She CONTINUES TO TALK SMACK about me and my friends. Not just for a few minutes for the next hour that we were there. She was literally talking about me to the patrons sitting at the bar. I would've left but it was one of my best friend's birthday dinner and I wouldn't dip on her due to this mean girl making me feel uncomfortable.   I've never had a waiter/waitress/bartender make me feel uncomfortable and threatened until now.  To really put a cherry on top, when our party was leaving she sardonically screeched "Have a nice night!" If anyone else would've said it, I know it wouldn't have been rude. I knew she was just trying to get one last dig before we left.   I really don't understand what I did to her to deserve her going out of her way to be mean to me and my friends. We're actually nice people who just wanted to have a good time.   I've been telling everyone Ocotillo is the best new restaurant in Phoenix. This is the entire reason our party chose Ocotillo for my friend's birthday dinner. The food is fantastic and the drinks are even better. Sadly, after being disrespected and feeling threatened by this girl I do not think I will be returning anytime soon nor recommending it to anyone unless they want to be heckled by a rude bartender.

Yum!   It's so refreshing to finally have quality coffee in the building I work in. One of my favorite aspects of Kream coffee is how they offer almond milk.   Another one of my favorite aspects of Kream coffee is the customer service. Aaron and Chris are great. They have a vast knowledge on their industry and are incredibly passionate about their work. I enjoy chatting with them while they make my latte.   Couldn't have asked for a better treat in our office building :)

What a disappointment.   Now, I held off writing a review after a horrible first experience thinking that Chestnut had potential.   First of all, they really have the ordering system wrong. You walk in and have to stand in line while they have one cash register for taking orders. Personally, I love places where I can pay and take my number to a table. There is really nothing more annoying than waiting for a server to bring you your bill so you can leave, although, Chestnut needs to speed up this process. There is no reason why I should have to stand in line for over 15 minutes when only 3 people are ahead of me in line.   I went in today with a broken leg. So clearly after standing at the door on crutches for 15 minutes I was already a little irritated and ready to sit down. The girl who took my order, just rude. You could tell she didn't want to be there and did not want to help me.   We ordered took our number and sat down. I'm still unclear if they bring the drinks to your table or if you're suppose to pick them up. After sitting at our table for another 10 minutes with no one bringing us waters or silverware my boyfriend went up to the coffee counter. There he found my drink and while he was gone an employee brought me his drink. I asked him for waters and he told me I had to get them myself. I explained and showed him I was on crutches and had a broken leg and could not carry them and kindly asked him to bring me one. He scoffed and said alright, the waters never came.   I ordered a Lavender-Honey Latte. Wow....that was the worst coffee drink I've ever had. I asked the girl if I could get something else because it was that terrible. I've never sent back a coffee drink until today. Steer clear of this drink. She brought me a sugar-free vanilla latte with almond milk. It was so-so but not worth $6.   For breakfast I ordered the Bibimbay Bowl which is two poached eggs on a bed of steamed kale, quiona and siracha. I don't know how they managed it, but once again another terrible dish. It was down right disgusting. Salty, the kale wasn't cooked enough and I don't know what seasoning was used but it was awful. After sending back my coffee, which didn't come out until after my food arrived, I wasn't even going to say anything.   After two terrible experiences at this restaurant, I will be eating breakfast at any other restaurant. It's safe to say that Chestnut is possibly the WORST RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX.
