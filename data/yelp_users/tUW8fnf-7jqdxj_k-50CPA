Excellent place to eat or day drink. Unique atmosphere and I enjoy the history that this old house carries. The fish and chips are to die for and so are the oysters. Typically I get worried ordering seafood in the desert, but this place always delivers fresh goodness.

I don't really think its fair for reviewers to knock them down a star because they are pricey. It's clear with the listing how much it will cost, but considering the quality of service and food, it is worth every dollar.  I would have to say everything on the menu was delicious. From the lamb pop appetizer to the "what's in this steak" which was delectable combination of meat, veg, and potato and definitely worth every cent.   The wine selection is excellent. The owner is so personable and you can truly tell he wants you to enjoy your experience. The staff is very knowledgeable, if you're traveling in the area, this should definitely be one of your stops.

Everything is so good. I love the salsa bar and their unique take on Mexican cuisine. Get a horchata, you won't regret it. The alcohol can be a bit pricey if you're not getting happy hour, but worth it. The margaritas are so fresh and I really love how they add a teensy bit of grapefruit.

Baristas are all excellent and make delicious, quality drinks. I appreciate the fact that this business is mindful on what they serve they're customers and where they get their products. They are always creating new drinks and I enjoy the fact that nothing is really seasonal in regard to coffee concoctions. If you like it, they'll make it. The pastries are made by the baristas daily. This shop is as local as it gets, all of the baristas have great insight on their craft. Sometimes there'll be a little line out the door, but don't be alarmed, it moves fast. Everything they serve is definitely worth a wait. My favorites are the green chilli cheddar bagels, almond milk latte, and their iced coffee.

So good. It can get pretty busy. My favorite thing to do is to just order a bunch of dishes to go since I can get a little crowded in there sometimes. The naan and the chicken marsala is so yummy.

Timo is quaint with modern, industrial decor. The patio is also a wonderful place to unwind and with enough shade from all of the trees, it's the perfect place to enjoy happy hour with your well-behaved pup. Oh and they treat your furry pals like guests instead of with the usual disdain some places have.   Sunday night lasagna and wine deal is a steal and addicting. I actually get cravings for that lasagna, definitely one of the best in the city. A huge portion full of veggie goodness, its the perfect plate to share with your vegetarian date and carnivores won't feel like they are missing out because it's that satisfying. It's the perfect way to end the Sunday Funday festivities.   Then there's the chicken Cesar kale salad... It seems like kale salad has become every restaurants trendy new item, but this one really takes the cake, or salad ;). Not only is the kale carefully baked to perfection, it comes with more than an adequate amount of fresh parmesan, and the grilled seasoned chicken is a taste explosion that makes you want to denounce every other Cesar salad in existence.  Seriously, it's that good.   Though the staff is knowledgeable and pleasant, some go over and beyond for great service. The bartender, Amy, always suggests the best meal or cocktail for the occasion and is willing to create whatever concoction you want. Not only is she atop of her craft, but she really treats her customers with utmost care, always making sure every experience is first-rate.   If it's not apparent by now, Timo is one of my favorite places in Northern Phoenix. If you're in the area, its definitely worth a try. It's a culinary experience that's not going to break the wallet, an easy place to pass the time and enjoy yourself.

Amazing happy hour. I love how this place gives such a great farm to table vibe. I'm not a huge meat eater, but surprisingly the bone marrow appetizer was quite delicious.

The food is alright. It's culinary drop-out so admittedly what is served there isn't going to be a complete disappointment, but don't expect to get anything organic or grass-fed.   They have a decent brown bag special with beers and the salads are alright. Little Cleo's can be pretty good too and I don't really consider that restaurant at the same level as CDO or part of this review. It's mostly just GMO products served by vapid, pretty "hipsters." I should be completely fair because some of the employees are really good, decent people who just need to pay the bills, but on the most part employees seem to be Hollister and urban o' wearing zombies. Sometimes they care about the job, you'll get a really awesome server, and other times you get a kid who cares more about gossiping with their coworkers than actually work.   As another fox concept restaurant, they basically exploit a trendy lifestyle without actually holding up to any of the values of the lifestyle they replicate. They don't recycle, and trust me, these restaurants produce so much waste. And as much as the yard does have plenty of bike racks, they could care less about being green, its all a facade, which irks me. You're also forced to vallet to play games and drink beer unless you find parking across the street. I think its due to the neighborhood complaining about people parking on their street, so if thats truly the case, then I guess so be it. In other cities it isn't so unusual, but still its flippin' Phoenix.   Why can't such a conglomeration, who is immensely profitable, be a good guy for once and actually do something right for the environment. Maybe discount customers who ride their bicycles if you can't recycle. Which, again why don't they recycle? Or any of the chain restaurants in Phoenix? When I see all of these tiny, local restaurants take the initiative despite their lack of resources be mindful about their products and their waste, it's upsetting to see such a huge place, with so many resources, just continue to add to the problem instead of trying to solve it.  The only reason I give 2 stars is because it's a great concept and there are some outstanding people who work there, but thats all. When you get down to the it, all this restaurant wants is to be the most profitable, they could care less about the local community.
