Way overpriced for the amount of seafood you get. Don't think I'll be going back to this spot.

Great sushi...great teppan. Shrimp fried rice is to die for! Great happy hour for appetizers and drinks.

Hands down, my favorite place for Carne Asada anything! New revamped location...super modern but still get that feel of home. Customer service is always good. Food is always aaamazing and very affordable!  Only 2 downsides....1. Im a wimp so I wish they had a milder salsa and 2. they seemed to have changed their cut of meat since their renovations. Still amazing flavor, just not the same.

Super full on the weekends with mediocre food. I had the beef tacos. Nothing to jump up and down about. I service was scattered. Most likely won't be returning anytime soon.

Me and the kids favorite place for Sunday brunch. Feels like home...taste like heaven. If your looking for an amazing breakfast...skip Denny's and IHOP and try this place!

Yum! That's all I can say. BBQ sauce is out of this world. Wish they had a bigger building...but the food speaks for itself.

Not a fan. Thier food is served cafeteria style...looked dry the 1st time I went. Flavor was off...meat is tuff...except the ribs. They wouldn't except my groupon before 2pm. Word of suggestion....go next door. Food is amazing.

If this place doesn't define mom and pop...i dot know what does. Very small location in a rough part of south Phoenix, but oh man...the food! My favorite is the shrimp and chicken Pad Thai and the Iced Thai tea. Price is very affordable and on most days, they will give you a free bottled water while you wait. Love this place.

I cant begin to explain how much I can appreciate a good ol mom and pop shop. This place definitely fits the bill!  I had the quesadillas (corn) of asada and cheese and mushroom....it was delicious!!  The price cant be beat ($6 for 3) either.  The server was so sweet and helpful and she spoke English so she was able to explain the menu....which she was happy to do! I will definitely be coming back. Love...love...love this little gem! And for those who were hesitant about the cash only thing...they now accept card. Just bring a few dollars for tip. They definitely deserve it.

Love their beek shawarma rice bowls! Not crazy expensive. Rice bowl can be made into a combo. They have flavored humms. Really good.

Love Tiffany for nail art. Place is family owned and aimed at pleasing the customer. Prices are decent as well. Sometimes they get really busy....but that's usually on the weekends. Would recommend.

Place was BOMB! Got to create my own delicious  concoction of my favorite middle eastern freshness. It's definitely a Chipotle for Middle Eastern food. This place is on my list of go to's from here on in. Absolutely yummy!
