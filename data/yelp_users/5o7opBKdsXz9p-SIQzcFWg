This place is NOT good. It smelled inside and the food was by far the worst Thai I've ever had.  We usually go to Taste of Thai, but when I saw this had more reviews and a higher rating, we decided to give it a try. What a mistake!!! The pad thai was gross, the spring rolls were disgusting, the green curry was ok but the tom ka ghai was horrible!   Yelpers really let me down on this one! I think it is recently under new management, so maybe these reviews are out of date, so steer clear!

What Ale's Ya is the ideal home brew supply shop. The owner/operator is super friendly and always willing to help you out .   Whether you're a seasoned home brewer needing advice on how to perfect a recipe or a first timer looking for a lesson in how to brew beer, they will be happy to help you out.  You can find everything you need to start brewing beer, wine and soda, as well as a full selection of pre-boxed recipe kits as well as all the grains, malt extracts, hops and yeasts to make your favorite batch. They also have a good selection of books and guides.  The best investment (and the largest) I've made at What Ale's Ya is their Kegging kit which contains all the equipment to start kegging your own 5 gallon batches of beer. It saves a ton of time and the owner walked me step by step through what seemed like a really intimidating and difficult process, but after his help I'll never bottle my beer again!  Prices are reasonable and the service makes this the only place in the valley I'll go to get my supplies now.   Home brewing is a great hobby and not enough of the shop owners have a true passion for spreading the joy of brewing, these guys really do!

The BEST sushi in the NW valley, hands down. It is a small, hole in the wall place yes, but what it lacks in the flashy decor of a Scottsdale sushi bar, it more than makes up for with consistently excellent sushi, and amazingly friendly service.  Every time you walk in Jung (the chef/proprietor) and the single waitress are friendly and cheerful. I've tried every roll and nigiri sushi they offer and they quality is consistently good and the value can't be beat, my wife and I can share 4 rolls and beer w/ sake for under $50!  They aren't usually busy, but with only 9 tables and a bar, it can't get too packed, and even with a full house the food is served promptly.   I would recommend everyone start going to Kaneya whenever possible because they are awesome sushi, and because it supports a local family owned business instead of some snooty sushi chain restaurant (RA?)!!!

How have I lived 3 miles from this place for 8 years and had never been in until a few weeks ago!?!?!  Man, I was doing it all wrong. Home made sausage, good Italian pasta, San Marzano tomatoes, everything you need to make a great meal all in one shop, with a side of personality!  I haven't tried the sandwiches yet, but looking at the big old hock of prosciutto de parma in their cooler, I'll be back for those next!

As the number of check-ins I have shows, i eat here a lot. And I never get bored of it!   The owners are super friendly, and they are always genuinely glad to see you when you walk in.   The Gyros are probably 2nd in the valley only to Haji-Baba in my opinion, but they are far from the best trick up the sleeve here!  Try the shish-kabob. Trust me, you won't regret it! Also, the souvlaki is amazing, and the dolmas are delicious!  Personally I get a gyro salad to go on my way home from the gym 9/10 times I come, but i also try to change it up and I've yet to come across something on their menu that wasn't delicious!

The cheapest and tastiest middle eastern food in Arizona. Period. There was a time I ate here 2 meals a day 3 to 4 times a week and I'm still in love 6 years later.   Next to mahmoun's in NYC this is the 2nd best falafel I've had and the Gyro deluxe is freaking amazing. If you're coming for classy restaurant experience then what the hell are you doing at a market in a run down strip mall? The ambiance is that of an ethnic market/cafe which is awesome!

We finally bit the bullet and decided to wait for dinner at Pizzeria Bianco. I was disappointed. No, I was angry at how bad an experience it was.  I won't be so naive as to complain about the wait, we went knowing it would be a long wait, and arriving at 4:45, we were told it would be 3.5 to 4 hours. No big surprise there. Luckily we were actually sat at 7:45, so that was nice.   The market salad was great, a super light vinaigrette, super fresh escarole greens and nicely shaved parmigiano reggiano. The Antipasto was amazing as well, with roasted vegetables and olives and sopressata. So far I was very pleased with my meal.  Then came the pizza. We ordered the Wiseguy, and added mushrooms and garlic.  Now I've had thin crust pizza cooked in a wood fired oven before, but I have NEVER had it be not only undercooked in the center but completely sopping wet. We're talking grab the crust and pull a slice to your place and only get 2 inches of actual pizza, with the rest of the mush still in the center of the plate. Ok, so its a little undercooked, big deal right?  Wrong. So wrong. The sausage must have been sitting next to the anchovies (which I like) because the sausage slices on half of the pizza tasted like  bait chum smells. If you've ever been to a harbor, and smelled that rotting fish carcass smell, imagine how that would taste and you'll understand.   My wife apparently lucked out and didn't get any pieces with that taste because she said it was fine. I was not so lucky. When she had a leftover slice the next day though she got a taste of that and literally lost her lunch.  I'm a VERY forgiving type with restaurants, but I am not ok with waiting 3 hours to feast on undercooked rotted fish tasting pizza. I've never been angry about a dining experience before now, but that's the only way I can describe this debacle.  I may give it another chance, but only after I've simmered for a while.

After a miserable experience the night before at Pizzeria Bianco, my wife and I decided to stop into Barrio Cafe and snagged a table about 30 seconds before the dinner crowd arrived.  Best spur of the moment dining decision I've ever made! Having grown up in southern California and living in Arizona I have a special fondness for Mexican cuisine, and I can honestly say Barrio gave me the best example of how you can do modern gourmet cuisine and retain classic Mexican styles.  First off the Quesadilla de langosta borracha made me reconsider what it means to be a quesadilla, and in a good way!  The Chile Relleno was amazing, open faced and covered in amazing cheeses, scallops and shrimp and accompanied by perfectly roasted squash and onions. Heavenly!  To wash that down with a properly made Michelada Picocito was just icing on the cake.  Speaking of cake, try the churros, they basically ruined zoos and fairs for me from now on because no $6 carnival churro will ever compare!  Now I just have to return 10 more times to try everything else on the menu that looked amazingly good! Comida Chingona is right!

I don't even remember who introduced me to Chino Bandido, but I owe them a debt of gratitude. For years it was like this secret club that if you were in the know, you were among a small group. I'm super happy that they have been getting a lot of press and TV coverage the last few years, but their popularity has become a double edged sword since even when I call 20 minutes ahead I wait 20 minutes after arriving. Worth the wait!  The best advice I can give someone who has never been is to go with an open mind and don't be afraid to try everything at least once!

Pizzeria Bianco (bear with me here) was the first bad review i wrote on yelp. And one of the few.  On a friend's suggestion, our faith in old-house-come-traditional-pizza-joints was restored when we came to Cibo.  I can honestly say that I've tried every pizza, salad and antipasto on the menu and have never been less than delighted by any of it.  Top it off with consistently good service and a great value, and Cibo has us coming back once a month if not more often.

One of the best Thai food restaurants in town. The only thing keeping me from a 5 star review is the service during lunch can be a bit slow.  Don't get me wrong, they are super friendly, but clearly get overwhelmed by the lunch rush of people from local businesses.   Putting that aside, the food is top notch, they make the best Pad Thai I've found in AZ, and if you're brave and get it Thai hot, the burn is so good, but doesn't mask the flavor!  The salad bar with the awesome peanut dressing is a big plus, and they make a tasty Thai iced tea as well. Great lunch spot if you work or live nearby!

I loathe this place. Partly because its a faux Irish pub*, partly because the service sucks and the food is mediocre at best.   I go to bars for good drinks and good food.  If the staff is hot girls in skimpy outfits, that can be a bonus, not a replacement for the other two.  There are places doing the "hot waitstaff" concept much better, find one and go there. Or better yet, find a bar you like that just happens to have a cute bartender, and be a regular there!  *True story, was once having a bad day and needed a good Irish whiskey to cheer me up. I asked what their selection was and after ~5 minutes of searching their backbar they found a (singular) dusty bottle of bushmill's. Nothing else... weak sauce!

We go to Vegas 3-4 times a year, and we usually try to get free rooms on comps. At first this meant staying at Imperial Palace (RIP), but luckily we now rate high enough to stay at PH.  Over the years we've stayed at IP, Bally's, TI, Excalibur and Luxor. None of them hold a candle to PH.   First, its pretty central on the strip, and the best part is from your room to the strip isn't a 5 mile hike like it is at some hotels. Then there is the fact that there is an ABC store in the Miracle Mile shops to get beer, liquor and water cheap and close by.   Then there is the fact that there are casual, fast places to fill your stomach when you wake up not feeling awesome (a Pink's chili dog will do wonders for a Vegas hangover).  The casino is mid-range, most table games are $15 and up at night, but some drop to $10 minimums during the day. The dealers are friendly and if you like the scantily clad type (makes losing money less painful) the pleasure pit features plenty of eye candy at night.  Then there are the rooms. They are smartly decorated and have some of the most comfortable beds I've found in Vegas. And the room hallways are quiet!  All in all, my new favorite hotel/casino!

Switch is awesome. If you read nothing beyond that sentence, its OK.  The decor is very modern and sleek, and the music adds a good ambiance without drowning out conversation. The drinks are creative, and affordable. The wine selection is good, and also affordable.  Where Switch blows me away every time is the food. Whether you want something light, healthy and refreshing or something over-the-top decadently rich, there are options for you. The cast iron clams are not to be missed, and on a hot day the Spartan pita really satisfies without overdoing it.  When it comes to sides, don't pass on the Mac 'n Cheese, but the one that keeps my mouth watering days after I've had it is the greek feta, cucumber and tomato salad. Talk about refreshing!  The other piece that makes Switch cool is the service, they are really attentive and the staff have definite personalities that make dining here a lot of fun!

If you want Cajun food in Arizona, this is the place to go.   If you want Oysters (remember, in season in months with an "R" in them) this is the best place in the valley to get them!   If you want a giant hurricane with a skewer of fruit sitting on top, this is the place for that as well! What can I say, I love an alcoholic slushy!  My personal favorites are the Pappas greek salad, the gumbo and the crawfish etoufee.   You'll pay a fair bit, but you'll never leave Pappadeaux hungry or unimpressed!

Tim Finnegan's is the best Irish Pub and hands down the best bar in the area.   They have the typical selection of pub drafts that you'd expect, and they are never overpriced for a good Irish Whiskey or mixed drink.  The food is amazing, always ask what the soup is. Paul, the head chef, will whip up some amazing soups that have to be tried. I love the shepherd's pie and the Reuben, and if you like hot wings, they are pretty darn good. Having tried them all though I can honestly say every single entree is delicious, and the bread pudding is not to be missed!  The service is solid, and everyone there is friendly and will learn your name after you've been there a few times.  Tuesday pub trivia is a blast, and the live music on the weekends is always great. I have yet to find a bar withing 15 miles of Tim Finn's that will keep me coming back like this place does!

They just updated their menu and it's good! They have a better variety of entrees now and all the new ones I've tried are pretty darn good. They also swapped out Strong Bow for Magner's Irish Cider and the Stella for Guinness 250 which is awesome.

Greek Gyros is my go-to spot when I want a healthy(ish) lunch near my office.  Their gyros are good but unremarkable. I don't mean that in a bad way, I just mean they don't stand out compared to other places in town. Their Dolmas are good, but I wasn't overly impressed with their hummus.  What I find myself ordering most often is their grilled chicken, either on a pita, salad or the plate (with rice and salad). The seasoning is so flavorful and they grill it up to a juicy perfection. If you do order chicken though, be prepared to wait up to 10 minutes for it, as they are grilling it to order and it takes much longer for them to prepare than the gyros they churn out quickly.

Came in for the $20 sushi and sake class. Amazing value, great sushi (what we tried) and extremely friendly staff and proprietors!  This place has a 'local' vibe that is hard to find at sushi places and even though it's a bit of a drive from home, I'd definitely come back.

Crackers & Co cafe is good, but every time I go something just isn't quite fulfilling, and I can't put my finger on it. It's not that I don't enjoy the food, or the awesome chili and tortilla soup.   I guess each time I go I'm not totally satiated the way I expect to be based on what I read on the menu.  Now don't get me wrong, the food is good especially the salad with pears and gorgonzola. The sandwiches are always good too, but like I said I'm always left wanting in a way that eludes me. But then I just order a lemon square and I'm perfectly pleased and all is well!

Words cannot express how much I love the meat shop. I love it like a fat guy loves the place that sells him the best bacon he has ever had... because I am and it is.  I'll be honest, it can be a bit intimidating walking in to the Meat Shop for the first time, if you aren't a chef and don't know your cuts, you may be afraid, but don't fear just ask for help because the staff are excellent!  Whether beef, pork or lamb, the meat here is always the best quality, and knowing its locally raised and by people who care about what they are doing makes it even better. And price? I've never compared closely but I don't really think twice about the price here!  Be warned! If you buy meat here, you will be ruined! You will never again be able to purchase that saltwater packed, antibiotic injected, hormonally treated, ammonia and pink good filled crap in your supermarket again!  And that is a very, very good thing.

As quick service Mexican food goes, Federico's hits the spot. What I find ironic is when this was a KFC, I would see cockroaches crawling all over the drive-through when I was nearby, and now that its a "hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint" its infinitely cleaner.   Late night drunken carne asada fries? Check!  Tasty adobada burrito? Check!   Rolled tacos smothered in guac and cheese? You know it!  Prices are reasonable, quality is consistent and good, and flavor is never lacking

I'm not a fan of roast beef or its many derivative dishes, but from what I see this is the place to get one. Personally I stick to the Chicago dogs and polish sausages and dang they are good and at a good price.  My only beef (har!) is that they aren't a TRUE chicago dog, as they are missing the cucumber and tomato, but regardless still a tasty dog at a great price!

The food is still decent but this place is going downhill fast. Today is my 5th visit in the 6 months since they opened and the place is in disrepair, literally!   There is scaffolding in the middle of the dining area holding up a broken roof truss. They had most tables full but the rest had discarded foodservice items piled on them and there were fries and soda all over the floor by the tables.  The soda counter was filthy and a sticky mess and I truly felt bad for the elderly couple I saw clean their own table off when they realized none of the staff would.   I really want this place and other small local restaurants to survive, but I don't think I'll risk being crushed by falling roof beams for the food again.  **Update, got a message from Vanessa, who says she is one of the owners*** She expressed concern about the cleanliness, and commented that the scaffolding was temporary while the sort things out with a contractor. What upsets me, and made me add this update is the comment she made to me about not appreciating my review (which was written from my actual experience).   Sorry business owners, if you can't take candor from your patrons on a public forum, you're in the wrong business. A negative review hurts your business less than allowing the negative experience that spurned the review in the first place!  Also, the part about being crushed by a falling roof beams was intended as humor, not an actual expression of fear of injury. I know nobody would be dumb enough in our litigious society to allow people in an unsafe facility.

I absolutely love what they are doing at Nobuo. We came first for restaurant week and then again last month with family in town.   The dining style is like Asian tapas, so you can try small tastes of a variety of food, and wash it down with Japanese beer, sake or cocktails.  The finesse and technique applied to the food is remarkable. The textures, layering of flavors and eye for presentation have only been equaled in my AZ dining experience at Binkley's, and that was at 2-3x the price.

Stopped in for a quick dinner Friday night while i was working late. For 8pm on a Friday it was dead (2 other tables occupied) but this seems to cater more the the lunch crowd for nearby businesses.   I ordered the pork bulgogi rice bowl to go and some gyoza dumplings. The Bulgogi was flavorful though not the best I have ever had. I guess you could say it was good without being outstanding.  Their menu looked interesting, and the portions were pretty generous, though the prices were a little more than your typical takeout (but not unreasonable). I plan on stopping in for some Udon and some Yakisoba and maybe give their sushi a try.  Its a clean little place and I hope that it lasts longer than the last few places in this location have!

Heard about Beckett's table at Devoured Phoenix, and I'm glad we went to try it out. Very cool atmosphere and decor, I love the community tables and the pigs hidden around the decor are fun to pick out.  The food was top notch, think traditional American cuisine with an international twist, classed up a notch or two.

Favorite new bar in town.  $5 pitchers of beer and cocktails for happy hour? Great prices the rest of the time? Yeah, I'm sold.  Amazing food, better than you should be able to find at a local, laid back place at prices like this. If its your first time, order one or all of these:  Russian Roulettes - sometimes mild, sometimes spicy roasted peppers. Deviled egg dip - deviled egg, bacon and home made kettle chips. Yes. Porkwich - do you need a description? PORKWICH. Bacon, ham, pulled pork, gold bbq sauce! Bring your cardiologist.  For sides, the Kale salad is insanely good, and their mac 'n cheese is enough to sate this m&c snob!

Not sure why this place gets bad reviews. This is by far the least aggravating gym I've ever been a member of.  Their rates are $10 a month. yes there is a $30 annual fee, but its still only $150 a year. I can't find rates like that anywhere in town.  I like that it is no frills. There is no juice bar, massage clinic, spinning class, etc. I've seen some new gyms that look more like a singles bar than a gym.  They have at least 2 of everything, tons of treadmills and elliptical machines, and the one time that the machines I wanted to use were all busy, I hopped on a treadmill for 15 minutes and the place had cleared out.  Also, unlike at other gyms I've gone to, the trainers don't come up and try to sell you on their services while you're trying to work out. I hated that at pure fitness.  I don't love working out, but I don't hate it as much since I joined YouFit.

An Indian restaurant inside a Holiday Inn? If it were anything but Tandoori Times I might have thought twice before trying!  I've only ordered takeout, but the food is as you'd expect if you've eaten at either of their other 2 locations, which is to say, its good.  The decor of the restaurant is modern and upscale, but both times I've picked up takeout the place was almost completely empty. If you show up and this is the case, don't be discouraged, the food is good and their bar looks fully stocked!
