Friendly and efficient staff, great hygienist and dentist!  Went in off of yelp reviews and they exceeded my expectations. Pleasant experience (not an easy task for a dental office)!

We went on a Thurs evening, 6ish, and as soon as I stepped out of the car, we were greeted by a group of friendly servers.  We got a table right away. I ordered the chicken tender basket with fries and my hubs had 2-pc chicken and a waffle.  We both ordered the sweet tea.  The sweet tea was delish...def no splenda in there but reminded me of my grandma's tea growing up!  Our food came out piping hot and was YUM!  Ok, so chicken and waffles isn't the most extravagant cuisine for a 4-star review but Lolo's won me over with their service.  The food beat Roscoe's in LA and fancy schmancy steak houses could learn a thing or two from their customer service.  It was the perfect experience for what the restaurant is going for!

YUM! So far this is the best restaurant I've been to in Phoenix. The service was fantastic.  They made us feel like we were visiting their house for Sunday dinner.  The guacamole with pomegranate was extremely tasty and the fresh tortilla chips were some of the best I've had.  For entrees, I was between the shrimp or the fish tacos and asked the server for his advise.  He told me he'd suprise me.  Love it! I ended up with the fish tacos and they were some of the best fish tacos I've ever had.  Coming from San Diego, that's a pretty big feat.  My husband had the chili relleno with shrimp and scallops and it was soooo tastey! I really wish we would have saved room for dessert.  The flan or the churros looked unbelievable.  Next time!  I hardly ever give 5 stars so check this place out!

Excellent service! They were able to help me out with an octagonal screen within 1 week of my initial call.  Very professional, efficient, reasonable and friendly.

We visited on a Saturday night for drinks and dessert.  Ended up getting a bottle of wine and sitting on the front patio.  They had some movie projected on to the wall next to us which was pretty cool.  Ambience was fantastic.  Lots of nice folks sitting around and striking up convos.  However, the highlight of my night was the dessert.  We shared this little piece of heaven...a toffee pudding thing with gelato.  I was pretty much the girl licking the bowl in the corner!  Ok...maybe not that extreme but I wanted to.  It was one of the best desserts I've had.  Can't wait to go back and try their other course offerings.

I "treated" myself to a 6 month membership.  Never did I think I would pass on a massage but this place has done it to me.  My introductory massage was in August and was amazing.  The therapist was receptive to my issues and did a great job with loosening me up.  However, once the contract was signed it has been awful!  I tried another location so I could get a facial and massage and both were terrible.  The techniques used by the therapist were just weird (but I'll leave it at that since my review is for the Camelback location).   I recently went in for a prenatal massage at Camelback and was disappointed, to say the least.  First, the waiting room was so busy with what seemed like 15 employees behind the desk and numerous customers waiting.  My therapist was 5 minutes late and made me feel like I was rushed.  It also didn't seem like he knew anything about prenatal other than asking if I needed a pillow for comfort.  The massage was awful.  He scratched my head for about 15 minutes (talk about knots afterwards) then started digging into my neck and shoulders without any oil so my skin was rubbing and it was uncomfortable.  I woke up today bruised and hurting in that area (which I don't think you're supposed to go so deep with a prenatal massage).  I've had tons of deep tissue massages over the years and never was in pain the next day (not to mention, he didn't even get a release out of it).  Then, the ending was so abrupt because of his poor time management skills.  I would rather pay $20-30 more to get better service (although, when they are selling you the membership, they make you think you are getting a spa-like, quality service).  Honestly, I don't think the price is that great either.  I've been to sports massage clinics and have paid the same and received a zillionth-times better therapy. I still have 2 months left on my membership and would rather give the massages away at this point than see if something like this happens again.  I would fight to cancel, but this is the extent of my fight since I'm just pregnant and tired. Great idea, massage envy, but I'll pass.

Came here on a weekend evening to grab a bite and some needed beverages. We ordered a bottle of wine and started out with their app special, the fried green tomatoes.  This was def the best part of the meal.  They were pretty yummy.  I had the seafood crepes as my entree and wasn't expecting and didn't like the cream sauce.  It was too heavy.  My husband had a turkey panini of some sort which was pretty good but you can't really go wrong with a sandwich.  I wasn't super impressed with the food or the ambience so not sure if I'll be back.

Dirty. Slow and unfriendly service.  Food wasn't bad but I felt sick thinking of how dirty their kitchen might have been based on the restaurant's cleanliness.  Should have gone elsewhere.

Thank you, TFK for existing! I wanted to try everything on the menu but it just wasn't possible tonight! This is a place I could go back to every day until I try the entire menu.  I was pleasantly surprised. The food is so fresh and the flavors are great, not too salty, not overseasoned, just right. We started with the thai shrimp dumplings- small portion.  I considered ordering another.  I had the teriyaki chicken bowl and loved it.  My husband had the chicken sausage pizza.  He loved it.  We were pretty content after the entree but I just had to taste their desserts.  The almond oilve oil cake was so delish.  Light, fluffy.  A great summer dessert.  Now if they would only post that recipe.  The portions are perfect, service is great, staff is friendly and the kitchen coordinator was on top of his s*@t!  See you tomorrow, TFK :)

Went with the hubs for our anniversary dinner because everything else in Phoenix seems to be closed on Sundays in the summer.  Views were great although you can't see the sunset because it faces south.  Ambience was nice...mostly couples and quiet with light background music.  I had the lobster which wasn't the freshest but it was prepared perfectly and the sauce was very tasty.  Hubs had the filet which was also cooked to perfection.  They brought us out a complimentary dessert, the pavlova. I had never had anything like it- raspberry sorbet covered in a meringue with whipped topping and raspberries.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  Also, the 1/2 price wine bottles on Sundays topped off the evening.  Def recommend for a romantic dinner out.  Will return to check out the patio with the firepit in the winter for apps and drinks.

Great ambience.  Maybe I had too much wine, but I loved their patio with the mistors (sp?).  We started with (a lot of wine) a small cheese board and proscuitto.  I liked that they let you pair your meats and cheeses and how big or small of a portion you want.  My hubs and I split their light cream sauce pasta and a pizza and both were delish.  We followed it up with more wine.    4 stars for pretty good food, great ambience and nice wine selection.  Will def be back!

So I only give 2 stars because I don't think you should fancy up a burger.  I've had some really amazing burgers for cheap.  That being said, the burger was good.  The truffle fries were ok...a bit too oily.  Nothing out of this world but ok.  The location is convenient being in the mall and the atmosphere is nice.  One weird thing are the cows wallpapering the place.  I'd rather not see what I'm eating while I'm eating.  Kinda freaked me out.   Seems like a great place to grab a beer and watch a game on a Sunday.

So we walk in and grab a seat at the bar while waiting for a table and are warned by another group about the service.  Ok, the bartender seemed to be having a bad night and was a bit rude and un-attentive.  Then, we overheard all the other employees complaining about issues with the restaurant and I felt like I was on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares! We finally were given our table and service was a bit slow (thank goodness for all the wine) but not extremely bad.  The waitress (who was really sweet) apologized for the kitchen and comped a dessert.    The 2-star review is mostly for the food since I've just had better italian elsewhere and for cheaper.  We had the calamari which was good but not amazing, the caprese which was fresh and you really can't mess up, the fettucini w/ light cream sauce and the tiramisu.  The sauce on the entree was uneventful and not reduced enough and the peppers were undercooked.  The tiramisu was not the best I've ever had....bit too much cocoa powder on top and a little light on the espresso.  Will prob visit the other Phoenician italian restaurants for comparison before returning.

Came here after attempting to go to the Vig Arcadia (which was way too crowded with a 2 hour wait).  My husband's friend had recommended it.  We were both pleasantly surprised.  We had a 20 or so min wait so we grabbed a couple beers at the bar.  Score! $7.50 for 2 pints of Stella. I don't think we've had a beer that cheap since our college days.  The bartenders were really nice as was the hostess.  We were seated outside which is a very nice patio with misters.  They had a great playlist of background music which added to the candlelit ambience.  I wasn't too hungry so ordered the ceviche for my entree and my husband had the windsor burger with roasted veggies.  Omg. Those roasted veggies were da bomd! I was upset because I usually pick fries off of his plate....but these veggies were exceptionally tasty.  The ceviche was okay.  His burger was cooked perfectly and prob one of the best burgers in phoenix so far (more so than vinburger, smashburger).  Being this place is fairly close to home with a great ambience, fair priced drinks and good food, we will definitley be back!

Exceeded my expectations. Our system hadn't been working since we moved in 7 months ago. Reasonable rates and extremely knowledgeable and professional. Prompt and courteous. Took the extra effort to explain things to me and offer tips for future use of our system.   Couldn't be happier with the outcome.

Best Sephora I've been to yet (San Diego, LA, Fashion Square). Girls are always super helpful and friendly. They never let me down with their recommendations. I tried new foundations out on my last trip and they even walked me outside to natural light with a mirror to make sure I liked it.  Store is nicely laid out and easy to navigate through.
