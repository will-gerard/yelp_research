Fun local place to hang out and grab a bite when it's a reasonable temperature outside. My bumblebee was excellent. They definitely have the fried chicken and biscuits down.  My friends' three burgers were all overcooked to well-done without the any hint of pink. They're not burger snobs like I am and had no complaints but i probably would have. I also felt the drinks were weak or watered down for $10 a pop. I'll probably be back to try some other food, but it wasn't a home-run as I had hoped.

I love horchata. Their horchata alone would be 5 starts.  Sweet and creamy without being overly sweet, and not that fake powder stuff!! The other aguas frescas looked very good. Wish I had more friends with me to sample the rest.   I didn't find the food itself to be anything special. Taco meats were dry so I just piled on onions, cilantro, lime and salsa verde. Ceviche was good but had a slight hint of "fishiness."  5 tacos for $6 was ok, but I was expecting cheaper for some reason. I think their whole cooked meats are a better deal - $7 for a whole pollo asado, 5.99/lb ribs and carnitas. I didn't try it, but come with a few people and split those items or take home.   There are some great deals to be found in the rest of the market.  3lb/99c bananas, 59c/lb white onion, 10lb/$1 watermelon are things I remember. Come here if you want your Mexican nopales (cactus), peppers, spices,  and the like.  Some of the fruits and produce looked great, others not so much.  So I guess you'd have to be lucky for what you need to be fresh.    Maybe if I'm craving menudo on weekends, I might come back to try.

Great deal for a wash, especially with the yelp check in. My car leaves cleaner than any of those automated drive through spots and they spend a good amount of time wiping your car down inside and out. However, they didn't vacuum my trunk and i had to drive back after the dry to do it myself and suck up some crevices inside as well. There were also towel streaks on the windows so they need to change out towels more frequently or use a better glass cleaner. Even with those, I'll be back for future car washes because I hate places like clean freak, which isn't that much cheaper than coming here.

Phoenix has a large but scattered population. I'm not sure why developers picked this location for a Chinese Culture Center.  It doesn't make sense to me as the area around Dobson might seem more appropriate.  The center seems like it'd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay.  I've heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal.  It's now not much more than a nearly-empty strip mall with "Asian" architecture.  I live up the street and would rather drive to Mesa/Chandler for anything Asian. Sad because I hoped Phoenix could do better.

Grew up in a family of 6 with our extended clan of 50+ in a 15 mile radius so Costo trips were an almost weekly occurrence.    Now that I live with one roommate, I find myself saying NO to things I know we won't ever be able to finish...like their beautiful meats, and huge fruit packages, and snacks, and pastries, etc. etc. But it's ok because I still like to walk down the aisles and stare at everything they offer.  Alcohol selection is great, and the Kirkland brand is generally quite good for a house label.    Gas is also up to 30 cents cheaper per gallon. Very convenient for those of us who live nearby. I don't drive a fancy car so I'm not concerned about it possibly not having additives like the "top tier" brands. My family has been getting Costco gas for years and our vehicles are going strong with 215,000+ miles.  The rewards of the AMEX card pays for my membership so it's basically free and then some.    Costo has everything: food, clothes, jewelry, electronics, housewares, liquor, wine, beer, sugar, salt, toys, towels, juicers, movie tickets, drugs, vacations, coffins (save a family member some trouble later on?).  Do your research and find out what's worth buying or not.    I dream of the $1.50 polish sausage and soda.  Their pizza is also very good (maybe greasy but delicious), and the chicken bake is awesome.  Just don't be counting calories.    Great concept, great value, great company.

My go-to study starbucks. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Music's usually not too loud. Wifi could be spotty sometimes but there are a couple of active networks. Their attwifi is not as reliable as the google wifi down at Starbucks, Indian School and 28th. Sometimes there's a spanish club that comes here to practice. I don't know what's proper coffee shop etiquette, but I think it's pretty rude to start jabbering away loudly when everyone else is quietly studying. I know I'm in a public space, but still!

Order a freshly made, plated salad at the register to save a few bucks for the exact same thing served at the restaurant next door. The girl at the register today was giving me difficulty, saying I need to just grab pre-packaged ones in the fridge. I've been here many times and never had problems before. I stood my ground and eventually received my nicely plated salad :). Smoked salmon salad is my favorite menu item. The tuna niçoise was also very good. You can pick up a nice bottle of wine and eat on the side picnic tables. I forget her name but, on a previous visit, there's a wonderful woman who helped us choose vino and brought us some wine glasses to drink outside. The occasional guests here are of the snooty variety and need to have their privilege checked. But they make for GREAT people watching and it's one of the reasons why my friends and I will linger around after a meal.

I've been a longtime Yelp lurker over many years, and have read thousands of reviews that have lead me to awesome finds and away from the not-so-greats.    Postino gets the privilege of being my first review! I have been in the Phoenix area for a total of 7 days since January and I have ended up at various Postino locations 4 times in those days. That says a lot from somebody who normally would always try a new place instead of frequenting the same spot over and over. Here's why:  Fun vibe - casually bougie without the pretense (it's possible!).  Awesome servers - attentive and personable without being annoying or overbearing. Amazing bruschetta - perfectly toasted with great combinations of toppings. I prefer the savory over sweet.  Excellent wine and beer selections - they've got your standards plus the locals plus some unique options that'll keep you busy. Price is right - I'll gladly share my student loans + interest with Postino, even after 5pm as I did last night with a group of friends.  I will say the cheap Asian in me isn't a fan of the valet parking (it's not always there, though). They are lucky I'm too lazy to walk in the heat of summer. My mother would be so disappointed if she knew I paid for valet.    As a new transplant just down the road, I have a feeling I'll be back many times.  For those of us busy during the day, I am so happy they have weekend happy hour and date night specials. Just need to find the date first, but I won't digress... ;p  Really though, other restaurants should take note.

Local hidden gem. I snapped some pics to share with my OU friends and they were definitely happy. Small place but packed on a weeknight. Two tv's to watch whatever's on.  No frills service. Good bar food. I'll admit I didn't find the wings to match their hype here, but I'd order them again if/when I come back. They have daily specials for you to save a few bucks.

Cheap and fast dry cleaning. Laundered shirts are less than $2 each. They took care of some stains I had been trying to get rid of for a while. Watch the one-way street out front.

Solid sushi place with multiple locations. Great value for the happy menu items. The place filled up just a few minutes after opening at 11 am, which is a good sign. Free miso soup upon sitting down and free edamame with a yelp check in. I thought they were a little undercooked though.  Buy a large bottle of Kirin and get a 99cent appetizer. We had fried calamari with jalapeños which were great and came with a nice dipping sauce.  We also ordered two rolls off the "happy hour" menu. Very nice fish:rice ratio. Some places jipp you with a lot of rice and little fish.  We also ordered the sakana sushi special. Needless to say, we ordered too much food with our hungry eyes.  The sushi fish itself was ok. I felt that it was room temperature instead of cold and straight out of refrigerator. Not fishy yet but just about to go under.  Slices are decent size, but some cuts were a bit sloppy. Total bill was less than $30 and that includes a few glasses of beer.  Would've been perfect if our third party member went to the right location...Double check where you'll be eating at!

I miss LA's Koreatown terribly but this definitely hit the spot. Pretty wide menu with familiar items mixed with more traditional Korean dishes.  Plenty of tables but the place still got packed on a weekday. Korean restaurants tend to be more spendy than other types of Asian food so be ready for that but they have some special deals posted on the wall at certain times. I will definitely be back to Hodori.

This location is so slow. I went here a couple weeks ago with over 30 minutes to spare before class and ended up barely making it. Orders were taken slowly because cashiers chit-chatted for way too long. And the barista (I think her name started with an M) was taking her sweet ol' time. Employees here need to be retrained and put through some speed/efficiency tests.

Uhm...this is what asian stores smell like so docking points because your olfactory nerves can't handle what's normal for most of the world isn't really fair IMO.  I actually thought Lee Lee was pretty clean - there are definitely worse around. Privilege, checked. Besides, you're not going to find 75% of what's in this store at your neighborhood Fry's or Safeway.   Anyways, Mekong and Lee Lee go head to head for best asian market in Phoenix metro. For some reason, the packaged meats here are much fresher than what's in the service section.  Seafood options are pretty well-stocked. Plenty of sauces and spices in the aisles.  The herbs and vegetables are the winner for me.  Some of the options look way better than what I'd find back home in CA, so that's a plus.  Prices vary depending on what you get.  The savvy market-shopper will keep mental tabs on where to buy which items for the best value.

I took my car here after finding a big screw in one of my tires. They didn't charge anything to pull it out and patch the hole. I insisted on paying something but received a "I couldn't charge you with anything even if I wanted to."  Very friendly staff.  I was out the door in 20 minutes.

I've seen this restaurant all over the country but never went because I thought it was pricey for what you get.  Fortunately, Deal Chicken offered a $100 4-course meal and a bottle of wine for 4 people. Definitely worth the experience for that price.   First of all the building and all the neighboring stores are dark at night. Not a very inviting complex if you've never been to the area.  However, the interior is decorated and set up very nicely, typical of a traditional steakhouse.  Be sure to ask for table with dual tops if you want to try different fondues. Kind of silly to force 4 people to agree on one item imo.   Since we sat at a double stove, we got two cheese fondues, everyone had a house or ceased salad, then we get two entree hot pots (mojo and regular), then two desserts (we had yin/yang and bananas foster).  Overall the food quality was very good with a few misses. Bread pieces were cold and stale. Cake/cheesecake were dry. The house wine was pretty awful for this caliber restaurant, but I guess it never claims to be a wine place.  I didn't have problems with the filet as some others said. I was actually surprised by how tender the meat was. Other endless entrees were chicken, teriyaki steak,  shrimp, and a vegetable ravioli. You get to request as many refills of the entree items as you want.  Sauces were great and changed up each bite.  It's a fun and interactive meal. We spent 3 hours total, which I wasn't expecting so don't be in a hurry afterwards. Service started good but then she disappeared somewhere after the 2nd course.    Overall: I wouldn't come back at regular prices.  Maybe just for dessert if you want a romantic date. Or simply have someone else pay. =)

More like bad egg. Feels like, looks like, and tastes like a cafeteria. Reasonable portion sizes. Oatmeal was dry; I had to add a lot of the milk. Biscuits were large but horribly dry. Gravy barely had any sausage in it.  A server dropped plates while bussing a table and someone dropped glass again right next to me, drawing blood with a minor cut. No big deal, mistakes happen. But an apology from management would've been nice. Won't be back.

I fully support the arts but I appreciate even more the nights and events that get you in for free! It's not a very large museum. Some of the exhibits can seem pretty boring, but take some time to read about the piece and/or artist to get a better understanding of what you are looking at.

I feel really bad for writing this review because the people who work here are super friendly and down-to-earth. Unfortunately, the food is not good and that's ultimately what it comes down to. Pho was way too sweet, which overshadowed the complex aromatics of a truly good broth. Bun bo hue was pretty awful. Tasted like fish-sauce water. Grilled pork on the vermicelli dish was wafer thin and dry. And they use a lot of coloring on their meats which makes the food look less appealing. Banh xeo had nice crunch but only had a few small shrimps inside and I don't remember seeing any pork at all. Vegetable accompaniments were each lacking something authentic to the dish. I did not try any of the macarons, but we were given crepe samples which were ok. Free drink with yelp check-in if you want to try some new drinks. I might come back to try a macaron, but not for the Viet food. Hate to be a food snob at a mom-and-pop place, but as Vietnamese food becomes increasingly popular, I'd want people to experience the real deal.

I've been here multiple times and ordered take out a few times since my initial visit and review. The food is always very good and authentic. Lobster is the cheapest in town and the ginger/scallion sauce is so good. Slobber it all over your rice. Other favorites include clam in spicy sauce, salt and pepper shrimp, beef and chinese broccoli. I don't think I've had a dish that was bad.   Yes, the place can be dirty and/or smelly but the food is the most authentic Chinese I've had in Phoenix and definitely worth a try. It'll put all your Americanized chinese places to shame.

I've tried several Vietnamese restaurants since moving to Phoenix and this is the best if you're looking for a place that does a variety of dishes well.  Vietnamese restaurants in more densely-Viet populated areas are known for specializing in specific items even though they may have a broader menu.  Therefore, I waited until after a few visits to write a review.   Da Vang wins easily over Pho Thanh, whose menu, price, and location I find comparable.  The pho broth is richer and less fatty.  The bbq pork (thit nuong) on vermicelli and rice dishes is much more authentic.  Their bo kho (beef stew) was very good and banh uot was also good.  I spotted some crispy banh xeo on other tables and I might want to try that next.    I think this will be my go to Viet spot in Phoenix.

I'll give it four stars for Phoenix dim sum. Price is reasonable. Most dishes were hot and fresh. There were a lot of people both before and after we arrived, which is a good sign. Go between here and Phoenix Palace, depending on which is more convenient for you.

Not a huge bowling alley but there were several lanes open when I came late on Saturday night. Lights were down with music videos blasting along the wall. They seemed to like Nicki, Madonna, and Jlo....  Anways the prices were ok at $13/person for 2 hours of bowling with shoes.  Not sure if prices change with larger groups - wouldn't 5 people in a lane be getting jipped at that price compared to just 2 people? Mixed drinks are extremely weak and overpriced. Don't waste your money on them. Bowling itself was fun. They have seemingly new (p)leather sofa-chairs.

I love holes-in-the-wall and the food here is fantastic. I came with a group and we ordered a bunch of dishes to share. Combination platters offer a sample of everything and we got shwarma to top it all off. The gyro meat was a tad dry but all the other grilled meats and falafel were great. They are not open late so be sure to get here before they close. Prices are excellent for the amount of food you get.

Stopped by for a few hours to get some work done.  Definitely hipster heaven as everyone already pointed out. Great atmosphere but can be pretty loud if you can't tune out sounds.  Internet was fast. I came during lunch rush so it was pretty packed and awkward to squeeze into an empty chair.  As people left, it became more manageable. Great for people watching without looking like a creeper (I swear I'm not a stalker though).  Sizes of drinks ran a little small - $5.50 for large dirty chai.  The baked goods looked amazing but I was on a diet and a budget. Great to see cooks right behind the counter making fresh food orders and throwing pastries into the oven. My olfactory nerves were in overdrive.   Only one bathroom of each gender so there were waits at times.  Rooms in the back were a bit quieter than the front but still busy. I also like that they have a bar if you're looking for a drink with some extra kick.  Minus a star because workers seemed a bit robotic.  Maybe it's their job to be efficient but a little personable touches in taking orders can't be that hard to add. They weren't mean or rude or anything, just a little stoic for what I'd expect from an otherwise cool place such as this.

Don't come here looking for anything specific or you'll probably be disappointed because it's a mess. You've got to have patience and scour over the racks because things are usually scattered outside of their designated areas. Yes, people here are crazy. Just get in there and join the crowd. Maybe you'll get lucky and find a great deal. Makes for good people watching.

I'm lazy and not fit. I'm the guy holding onto rocks hoping not to fall into cacti while watching runners breeze by as if on air, and wondering how they get their foot landings so perfectly balanced. For people like me, go slowly and steadily. Bring a lot of water. Wear sunscreen and make sure the sun and temperature are on your side. Plan 2-3 hours up and down. This is a hike/climb. No pain, no gain!

My first time here several weeks ago was great. My second time lost a lot of points. Monsoon rains were coming and water leaked from the ceiling onto our chairs and table. Apparently the waiters didn't think a leaking roof was a big deal in a restaurant and didn't do anything to accommodate. We ended up just sliding the table away ourselves and heard no apology from anyone.    We asked our server for a minute to take our order soon after we arrived. He took forever afterward and only came when we flagged him down after making awkward forced eye contact. During my meal, he took my plate without asking if I was finished - I was still working on those fries and had to physically grab his arm to set the plate back down.   Then there was this witch with a B giving us attitude because a friend asked why she didn't tell him she had moved his phone that was charging near the waiters' computer workstation. They exchanged some heavy words and we asked to speak to the manager.  The other workers were watching and smirking during this time. She claimed she didn't work there so she couldn't get fired (She was wearing all black like every other employee and had been chatting it up with two other waiters at the station for a while, but whatever she says...).   So minus  stars because these waiters were awful and don't care about repeat customers. Minus stars for upcharging to sub for a measly portion of fries. Minus stars for not stepping in to stop a confrontation in the middle of the restaurant that was completely unnecessary. Minus stars for leaky roof and, hoping no one's contaminated.    They'll get to keep a few stars because the food itself isn't that bad. There's too many comparable restaurants in Phoenix for me to be back.  Bye bye FEZ, too bad.

Still a great production but I was expecting to be more impressed based on hype.   Le Reve's theater is beautiful and just walking in makes you feel like something cool is going to happen.  While the show had some great moments, it got kind of repetitive to me and the storyline was pretty lame. I actually dozed off at some parts of the show. They just do the same thing over and over without enough wow-factor moments to keep me fully engaged. Sometimes there were too many people on the small stage and in the air...I didn't know what to focus on. Seats higher up are better because you get a bigger field of vision to see everything.  People say not to compare it to O but it's hard not to given the acrobatic themes and water-based stage. I'd rather watch O for the 3rd time than Le Reve for the second

Really cool eco-friendly, energy saving design.  Electric panels in lot offer covered parking.  Reminds me a little bit of the atrium-style MLK library in San Jose. Unfortunately, sounds echo and there's the constant dinging of elevators arriving on each level.  5th floor reading room was too hot  as I tried to study, but AC was fine on other floors.  Also, staff should be more attentive in preventing loud groups and those watching tv without headphones in quiet areas. Wifi is fast and reliable. I appreciate that patrons and staff, for the most part, aren't bothered by the homeless trying to avoid the outdoor heat or find things online with their public computers.

Campbell and 40th is my favorite food intersection in Phoenix so far.   The food itself is probably worth 4 stars but I'm going to bump it up for Courtney, our server who was great. Prompt, efficient, friendly.  This place is actually very reasonably priced if you order the right things.  Each pizza is enough to share (as stated on the menu) but we were ambitious and ordered more than enough. Thus, it allowed for us to sample different kinds and take some home which I'm def not complaining about.  The tap beer prices are also a great deal if you order the growler and split among friends. I'll probably buy the jug next time, which you can bring back and get even more discounts on a refill.  Pizzas had a great crust, like a thin crunchy asiago flatbread. Don't forget to add the freebies like onion, garlic, egg, chiles, and extra love. Very good. Friends had gelato and a red velvet cupcake that they said were enjoyable.  Atmosphere is spot on for a joint in Arcadia. Server correctly split our bill without hassle.   Pizza, beer, fun. I'm going to find a fat, lazy day where I just go back and forth between Postino and LGO.

Macarons are pretty good. Comparable to the best I've had in LA. I wish they had a few more flavors of the large ones. The little ones are too small - more like a teaser and are only sold in preset multiples. Also, they close early so plan accordingly. Service sacrificed friendliness for efficiency imo.

I'm a fan of The Vig. All three of them. Great place to hang out and lounge around. They don't fuss if you come in for just a drink without food. There are heaters and fireplaces to cozy up around. Service always friendly. Varied menu to pick from. Come check it out if you haven't.

I've been here several times now and I think, overall, Phoenix Palace has the best dim sum in the Valley. I love scoring a table right where the carts come out. It sucks if you sit in a corner and all the food is either gone or cold by the time the ladies get to your table. I'll take my ticket to a cart across the room if we've been waiting too long. There are too many dishes to go over, but the congee here is excellent. The only dish that fell short was the har gow - skin too thick and shrimp was mushy and falling apart.  We ate a lot and our tab was about $11/pp. My current dim sum order of preference of distance wasn't a factor: phoenix palace, great wall, china king, mekong.

YES. i've definitely just found my go-to Chinese spot in the Valley, and it took way too long.  Their menu is so massive. Good thing asians eat family style. Watching the gringos next to me awkwardly share "weird" plates was quite entertaining. I need new friends to go with me so I can try everything.  But you're uninvited if you're going to order sweet and sour pork or orange chicken! It's in a large strip mall and the neon sign outside isn't working so keep your eyes peeled at night.

So I've come back several times to try more of the menu. I would say to stick to the Hong Kong style dishes and away from the other regional cuisines.  They're not done badly, just not as well.

Really fun place for happy hour with a good number of food and drink options at reasonable prices.  Cheap tap and bottled beer, mixed drinks (very good), and 1/2 off wine glasses. The happy hour portions are tasty and large enough to leave you full.  Service was so-so but not bad enough to prevent a return visit. Nice staff but took a while to get our orders and bring back drinks and checks.  We came on a Friday evening and there was quite a wait as we left, so plan accordingly. There's free valet with the obligatory tip.

Nice spot for a cold, creamy sugar rush. I impulsively got the large size and it was gone by the time I got home; granted, I live over 20 minutes away.  The pearls were perfectly chewy, not overcooked or old from sitting out. They are more sweet than other places so be ready for that.  The taro slush was very good. Minus star because my scoop of boba:slush ratio was skimpy. No more pearls before half the drink was gone. Tip: shake your drink around before sticking the straw in to evenly distribute the goodies.

Of course, Korean food in AZ doesn't compare to CA but this place satisfied my craving. Galbi marinade was good but could have used a bit more char. The seafood pancake was tasty but could have stayed 30s longer each side for a more perfect crisp.  Side dishes were good except cabbage kim chi, which I thought was too bitter. And drinking makgeolli out of a tall beer glass just felt weird. Food can be about $20/person without drinks or tip but you'll leave full.

Don't get in line if you're not ready to order. I did that and got judgmental stares because I'm indecisive need to look at all my options. This place is casual but offers good quality food. The clientele is noticeably different from that of Johnny Rockets and Panda Express (love Panda btw) downstairs.  I would stay away from the boring sandwiches. The paninis, pizzas, pastas, entrees, and salads all look great. I enjoyed my mushroom and ricotta pizza. Wasn't wowed by the tomato soup. Prices are Nordstrom prices for "cafe" food.

Food is pricey and didn't look very good. Too bad nothing around was open. As the food came out, I'm glad all I ordered was a beer. Looked like a dirty diner with the employees just sitting around watching tv bc there were no guests. Won't be back if I can help it.

Watched a movie on the large Cine Capri screen and it was great visuals and sound. The other auditoriums looked pretty small however and I probably wouldn't have enjoyed them as much.  Plus a star for $7 student tickets (cheaper than Costco's $8) every day unlike AMC, which only allows student tix one day a week.

People saying this is great sushi have not even had good sushi. Sorry, I'm a food snob. Actually, I shouldn't apologize for knowing what good Japanese food looks and tastes like.  SakeBomber is another addition to my "Asian food in Phoenix disappoints" list. Oh and I won't embellish on how annoying it is to wear a wristband upon entry if I'm even just contemplating ordering a drink through my meal.   PS: I'm not as bitter as I sound right now.

Large, clean, organized, stocked. They have samples in the grocery  and the cashiers open more registers when busy, unlike walmart down the street.  Wish the target near my place was as good as this one.  PS: there's a yelper below who thinks sushi is Chinese? sm(asian)h

More like a 3.5 but I'll bump up because it's a cute, busy place with reasonable prices.   The pizza crust is pretty good except the center still gets soggy. Maybe Neapolitan's are like that because I've yet to find one with a crispy crust in the middle. They kind of skimp on the basil though. Chicken pesto lasagna was very rich but not enough chicken. It had a nice sauce that I soaked up with the accompanying bread.  Get this if you love cheese. We also had the the rigatoni al forno which didn't seem like anything special.  We calamari and cheesecake passing by our table looked really good but I wasn't hungry enough to try.

Got a falafel pita combo with greek salad and soda for less than $10.  They gave me the wrong order, which I noticed once I got to the car. Returned, swapped bags and left. They redid the other order since I peeked in to make sure it was mine.  Nice to see because I could imagine some places just giving the other customer that bag I looked into.   Very happy with the food. I'm a huge fan of tzatziki sauce and this place was just right. I should learn to make my own batch to store in the fridge and put on everything I eat.  Yes, the salad has  a ton of feta, but I think it's better to have a lot and scrape some off than to have too little and wanting more.    Atmosphere isn't anything special - more of a quick-bite and/or carryout place imo. I'll be back to try their meat dishes.

I hate Walmart. How it destroys small business. How it treats its employees. How corporate reaps all the benefits. But it's close to my place and it's usually cheaper than the competition. And I'm a student living off loans, so I'll be shopping here until I can afford otherwise.   This location itself isn't as bad as others here make it seem. I mean, you're going to Walmart, not a Whole Foods/AJ's/Nordstrom type of place. I've seen nicer stores, but I've also seen worse. Maybe Phoenicians here don't know what the real 'hood looks like. Just don't make eye contact with the guy blasting bass out of his car and you'll be fine. I actually like to walk down aisles and hear different languages, even if they're usually bickering with each other.  The store is pretty big for a Walmart but I agree they need to restock more as some items I needed empty with no employees nearby to check the back.  And they do need more registers open. And they need to sweep the floor. But it's Walmart and I've lowered my expectations, so I won't complain.

Whenever I'm sick, I get the preserved pork and egg congee (porridge) to-go with a side of extra Chinese donut to dip in.  I haven't tried anything else, but that congee always hits the spot.

Another run-of-the mill Americanized Thai restaurant that seems to be the norm around AZ.  Rubbery meats, American broccoli, boring carrots and zucchini. No spice factor, few herbs and fish sauces, no authentic dishes, or dishes done authentically. Where's the roasted duck red curry, larb salads, Asian/Thai vegetables, whole-fried fish, papaya salad with blue crab? Oh, I forgot I'm in Central Phoenix. Geeze, I'm such a food snob. If ya'll think this is good, your mouth will MELT when you get the real stuff.  On the plus side, it's a nice, small restaurant and was very busy at lunch. To-go orders don't get the house salad they serve but you do get a little eggroll wrapped in foil.  My search for  true Phoenician Thai food with bold, complex flavors continues.  Any leads would be greatly appreciated.

i came looking for what I thought were standard items in larger Asian grocery stores and was disappointed.  Mekong and Lee Lee on Dobson have much larger selections (vegetables/herbs/meats/seafood) at cheaper prices. Too bad because I live so close to Super L.  Maybe I'd come back if I wanted some Peking Duck or Roasted Pork from the deli.

This is some pretty good ice cream.  I'm glad this is far from my house and that I don't have a sweet tooth because otherwise, I'd be breaking the bank and widening the waist.  I sampled 4 flavors and wanted them all but settled on one and picked at my friends' servings.  Much better than another ice cream joint I recently visited in downtown Scottsdale.

Last couple times, servers started weighing the scoops and took ice cream out if there was too much. Who does that for portions that are already too small for the price?? Minus a star.

The first time I had Nogales, it was amazing. The next time, it was still good but not as great as I remembered. Maybe it's better when you're drunk.  Maybe I realized the second time that the dog itself was pretty small.  The toppings add a unique flavor. I wish the bacon was more crispy and that it stood out more. $3 per dog.

Cheap, good, fast Taiwanese food. Get rid of the Americanized menu and I might give you the 5th star.   Note for people expecting awesome service here (and at many other Asian places). Don't. It's a different food/restaurant culture. Want something? Make yourself seen and heard.

True Food serves up some bougie, and supposedly healthy, options.  Their dishes look and taste great.  I really enjoyed my tuna sliders with sweet potato hash and kale. However, portions are small and you'll get hungry again sooner than you should for the price you pay. Know this going in and you won't be disappointed. Nice to see cooks prepping your fresh veggies out in the open.  Our server started off doing a good job, but then disappeared somewhere so we had to flag down other servers.   Overall, this was a good place to try one time but it won't be on my list of regulars.

I enjoyed the vibe of this place when I went around 9pm on a Friday night. Dark and loungy with comfortable seating.  Music is at a level that encourages you to get close to your dates but not loud enough that you have to shout. I don't like waiting very long at a bar to get a drink, and I can see myself getting annoyed here if it were more busy.  Despite that, Sidebar is just a cool place to hang out for a bit.

I waited until eating here several times and trying different things on the menu before writing my review. Overall, I've been pretty unimpressed with Phoenix Mexican food since moving here.  Turns out La Frontera serves up what I consider to be the real deal. I'm surprised there's not more competition (send me suggestions!).   Hands down, the shrimp taco from the seafood side is my favorite. Perfectly fried and comes with a nice sauce. I'd pass on the ceviche...I'm not a fan of the tomato juice they mix it with. From the meat side, I like pretty much everything but tripitas, cabeza, and lengua are my favorites. I usually get a mixed plate of tacos and for some reason, they always seem to mess up just one of my taco meats. Other than that complaint, prices and hours are great.

Slowest. walmart. ever. I always question how I end up here while standing in line forever. The caja rapida is anything but. My pissed-off glare is usually very effective but it does nothing here.

I had a great time at the Beverly Hills location and was excited to see Scottsdale offer a summer special: $40 with dessert. Even though I ate a lot, I was underwhelmed by my dining experience.   When eating out, I expect service to correlate with the price point of a meal. Fogo's service should be approaching outstanding. At the very least, I shouldn't be questioning throughout: Where is our waiter? Are they going to bring more sides? Are they going to clear our plates? We've been sitting here a while, are they going to offer dessert? Seems like they don't want us to pay, should we dine and dash? At least our water server kept our glasses full.  We ended up just asking him for more sides and he happily filled our request. Props to him because our waiter was useless: unwelcoming,  not personable, not attentive.  On to the food: the salad bar looked fresh and I enjoyed having some greens to munch on between meats and carbs.  The polenta fries had a nice crunch.  The bananas (what happened to thick plantains?) were good but didn't have a nice crispy exterior.  The cheese bread though is amazing, especially when hot. I could eat these all night, every night.  They probably get a star for the bread alone.  The meats were variable.  The lamb was very gamey and I usually love lamb. Some meats were very salty, especially the pork ribs.  I found the beef ribs to be a bit dry. I liked the different sirloin cuts.  My friends found some meats to have huge chunks of fat - I don't mind that because I like the flavor and texture. Just cut them off if you don't, no big deal.  Sausage and chicken were also flavorful. No sight of ribeye all night. I did have a problem with the gauchos not knowing what medium-rare looks like. They kept giving me medium to medium-well even after they slice a piece and checked it. Why even bother asking me what I prefer if they're not going to give the right temp? I wouldn't have ordered dessert if it didn't come free with the summer special. Seemed mass-produced and overly sweet.  Funny thing is that the wait team was very attentive to the larger table next to us. I overheard a patron there raving to his first-timer guests about how the food and service are ALWAYS wonderful here and how he ALWAYS has a great time. Wish I had the same experience. I'll take my money elsewhere for a pricey night out.    I was going to give 3 stars until I realized that was "A-OK" and 2 stars is "Meh. I've experienced better." Sorry Fogo, you were a 2 that night. Thanks for reading my Fogo essay.

LOVE. So peaceful on the busy Strip. I don't gamble and I don't smoke. My party days are dwindling and I generally come to Vegas now to eat, watch shows, relax, and sleep. I don't want to walk back to a smokey hotel casino. I don't want to go to a pool with a few hundred 22yo's screaming and stumbling around. I prefer a beautiful hotel that smells awesome, provides unmatched service, has a luxurious bed and bathroom, offers fantastic views of the Strip. C'mon, their lobby is on the 23rd floor! And you can rest your bum on a seat in the elevator.   Don't get me wrong. I'm a poor grad student living mostly off loans but I know how to budget if I've got a big expense coming up. The prices are sometimes outrageous and I'm not going to stay here every time. I even park at the Aria for free and shamelessly walk over to avoid valet - that saves you 2 vegas drinks or a Costco-sized vodka! But splurging once in a while and treating yourself well feels soooo good. One day when money is no object...one can hope, right?

This place is quantity over quality. I came for a weekday lunch and for $10, the food was just "meh." I would not let this be your introduction to dim sum, because those dishes are not very good. You can get a real dim sum lunch elsewhere for comparable pricing.  Eagles is an option if you want a variety of mediocre food. To be honest, nothing really stood out for me. My friend randomly threw some cash into a slot machine and won enough to cover our meals. That was good because i wouldn't pay to come back. Service though, was pretty good. Our plates were cleared and drinks kept full.

3.5 stars.   My biggest gripe about Gallo Blanco is the service. It's been incredibly slow and inattentive each time I've eaten here. I just end up grabbing more plates/utensils/napkins from the service bar myself because we're rarely checked on. We also wait forever after being seated for orders to be taken, long enough to be irritated and flag down bussers (who are awesome) to find our servers.   HOWEVER, I like the atmosphere of this place. It's cozy, casual, and fun. There's a neat patio on the roof that should be utilized more...they can pack your food in plastic trays to bring up. The food items are hit or miss. These are not the best tacos in the world. I find most of the meats too dry. Shrimp is the way to go but you'll ask yourself, "Where's all the shrimp?" when it arrives. Gauc is pretty good and they have some interesting mixed drinks to try.

Pretty easy trail but you have to pay a vehicle fee to get in.  The view isn't as great as some of the other peaks closer to Phoenix, but it's nice to avoid the crowds once in a while.

Took about an hour for an oil change. I was expecting to get a wash and vacuum with it as stated on their website and in several reviews here, but I never got those with my service. Maybe because I used the yelp deal and declined to fix their other findings with the car? Kind of annoyed about that, but $20 for oil change with the yelp deal so I'm not going to hold a huge grudge.

More convenient to central Phoenix than Lee Lee. Their seafood is better than Lee Lee's but I do not like the pre wrapped produce here. This forces you to buy set quantities, which are often more than I need. I also find the selection and quality  of produce here inferior to Lee Lee.  Other than those two differences, I think the rest of the stores is comparable and that prices average out.  Unfortunately for me, I'm usually looking for specific herbs and vegetables and find myself driving farther down into Chandler.

Great food, great music, great vibe.  This is one of the few old house-converted-to-restarant/patio/lounge places that works.  It's very intimate, yet homey, at night and perfect for both dates and larger groups just wanting to hang out. They have cozy fire pits outside.  I'm not a big sandwich person, but the ones here are pretty good.  I love the toasted bread, although it was a little dense. I also found the salad to be boring and overdressed.   The food will not break your bank. Service was quick and friendly. This is a spot to keep on your list. And it's next to Miss Anita's Pie Shop!

Cool place in Scottsdale, especially with HH (Matinee) until 9pm.  Drinks are creative and well crafted. Wouldn't pay  regular price for them but between happy hour and the different yelp deals, they are not so bad.   I sampled the mac and cheese, tuna tartare, and a couple of the flatbread pizzas. Food is mediocre imo and service is slow.  Next time, I'd go for the drink, loungy vibe and music but pass on food.

Pleasantly surprised at what i found after walking through the doors. Yum. I underestimated the 2 taco plate size and got two additional street tacos (happy hour 3-6 m-f), leaving me stuffed.  The fried shark was great - awesome crunch with perfect texture while not being fishy. I've had better mole but it's worth the try if you've never had it. Carne asada and cochinita were also good.  Experiment with the different salsas to make each bite different.  This place is not cheap for tacos but def worth the groupon when available.  Good luck parking in front if it's busy.

Most of the food here is very good. Oysters are fresh. I really enjoyed the combo pan roast. The gumbo was also tasty but had okra which I'm not a huge fan of. The clam chowder was too salty, and I wouldn't order it again.  The freshly baked hot bread was a plus and used as a sponge to mop up all the goodness. I found service to be inattentive. We stood around for awhile before without being addressed, ended up just taking a seat (all the tables were empty).  Took a while before being asked about drinks and bread was served to two tables seated after us before I had to ask for any. Our credit card also sat on the table for a while before it was taken back. I'd understand if they were busy, but they were not. The service really hindered our experience.

I'm no Indian food expert but I thought this place was pretty good. Enough meat and vegetarian variety to sample different flavors. Naan is brought out fresh to your table, but they were kind of slow with that and it was inconvenient to wait. Lunch buffet price was great and you can definitely walk away full.

Great place to hang out for a bit if you catch their awesome $3 happy hour deals: all beer, house wine, well drinks. Also remember there's a drink of the day all day. The environment is a little hipster but more casual and without the snooty judgment looks.  Didn't try main food dishes. I thought wings had good flavor but they were not served hot. Hummus tasted like the tub I have in my fridge - nothing to write home about.  Overall, come here to throw a few back and start your night.

Pretty good for viet food in Phoenix. I've only had BBH (please don't call it pho...completely different flavor profiles with different origins, different spices, different stocks, different noodles, different herbs, etc. ok done with mini rant) but will be back to try some other dishes.  Flies in the dining area though so get ready to swat, especially if hot outside.

Pretty dead on a Wednesday night. Their chips are really good and will salvage a star. They charged 50 cents for a tiny tin of pico de gallo ("the kitchen makes us charge for anything that comes out").  Tacos were nothing to write home about. La Condesa is similar concept but much better execution...and they love their grouponers...or at least they don't give people a hard time.  I paid $14 for two tacos with rice and beans. My LA friends would shoot me.    We had trouble redeeming expired groupons. Waitress made it seem like she was doing us a favor to remove the paid value (3 whole dollars), which never expires and must be honored by the merchant per the fine print. They wouldn't let us subtract the paid value from a 2nd expired groupon ($3).  Anyone, please correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding is that expired vouchers become treated like cash. Fine print says PROMOTIONAL value can't be combined with other offers, nothing about expired PAID values.  Manager (Missy) said she didn't have any written groupon contract in the restaurant (why not?) so I showed her the fine print on my phone.  Acknowledges what she reads but still insists the owner (who's not around, supposedly his name is Joe) says they can't do anything else. She said I can send him a message. I ask how do I do that if he's not here and she says "on yelp" so here I am!  If you're going to partner with groupon, then honor the groupon rules...or have the rules on hand to show a customer he's wrong if he is misunderstanding something!   Missy tried to make things right with a VIP voucher for future visits saying it was a better deal than the $3 groupon.  Actually, it's not because I'd have to buy two drinks and an entree to get a free entree instead of spending just $3 to get $10 worth of food. Regardless, it's the principle of the matter not a lousy $3. Just be happy we tipped well on the original bill.   I hate when Yelp reviews become rants, but they must be done!

Yes! I love walking into a place like this and feeling my bougie self get juiced up. Service was good. Great bar snacks and plenty of drink options during social hour, although I wish they used less gin and vermouth.  They may have had the best roasted nuts I ever had.  I already had dinner plans and didn't order an entree so I can't speak much about the actual food.  I did take a bite of my friend's cobb salad and it was pretty darn good, even though it reminded me of the smoked salmon salad at LGO.  I wish I got out of work earlier to catch their happy hour more frequently.

The donuts are great when they are fresh. Problem for me is that I come in very early and sometimes feel like I'm getting leftovers from the night before. I hope they quality control and toss donuts that have been sitting out too long, but it doesn't seem like it. Ask for new ones off the rack if you're suspicious of old-looking donuts!

Fast, cheap, and good food. Last star reserved because servers were overwhelmed by dinner rush, sauces were a little salty (but not a deal breaker), and we sat in a cramped corner in a dining room that got pretty hot. I'll be back though to try other things.

Had an 8:30 dinner reservation and arrived to a packed house with live band playing. The ambience was great and works well for both large parties and romantic dates.  I don't usually eat out at Italian restaurants but was pretty impressed with the food here. Seafood risotto was the winner of the night. Plenty of different seafood pieces in every bite and the risotto was cooked just right.  The pasta trio is also very good, with the mushroom one being my favorite and gnocchi a close second. I also shared a caprese salad that was good but nothing to write home about. I'd probably pass on that and try something else next time.  They have a decent wine list with varying price points that will accommodate your tastes and budget. The entrees, while not inexpensive, were reasonably priced for a nice dinner and atmosphere in Scottsdale.  The only downside was that our pasta plate was brought out cold. They quickly took it back and made a new one without complaints, so that was appreciated.   The menu is varied but not overwhelmingly extensive. I'll be back to try other items they offer.

3.5 stars. I don't think it's worth full price but look online for some coupons or use the yelp check in that saves about $5/person.  At that rate, it's a little more expensive than Pacific buffet and comparable in quality. The place looks more upscale than the average Asian buffet and dishes ranged from bleh to great. Oysters were a little scary and tasted like dirty pond. I made my money's worth on lobster pieces, hot crab legs and crawfish. The sushi selection is better than Pacific but by no means great. The only dessert worth getting is the ice cream/gelato.  All the other options seem bought from elsewhere.

My friend was staying at a fancy schmancy hotel in North Scottsdale so it was the perfect opportunity to hit up this spot.  It was worth the drive! We had the 3 piglets and taco trio.  Meats were generous and full of flavor. Different BBQ sauces for you to mix-and-match. Prices are reasonable for the food and atmosphere. Not outrageously expensive. I will definitely be coming back here. Tom's Thumb will join Oklahoma Joe's on my list of awesome gas-station-bbq joints.

Best beer happy hour around and still a huge fan of their bruschetta and the nine iron sandwich. Wines are also great at $5/glass and there's actually a selection instead of just house red or white. Come on a weekday before 5 to avoid the crowd. Our waitress offered to split the check but messed it up afterward. My order of preference amongst the Postino's is Arcadia, East, then Central.

Atl has some very good wings. They are a nicely sized with enough meat and the right amount of sauce. I was full off a dinner of 9 wings and shared cheese fries. They don't have a lot of people working so you might have to wait while one person juggles taking orders, answering phones, and bringing plates to tables.  Aside from this, the workers are very nice.  My only other complaint is while the exterior of the wings had a perfect crisp, the center wasn't hot  enough (temperature) to my liking. Still, I'd def considering driving out here to get my wings fix.

After being stuck in the rural Midwest for two years where food options were extremely limited, this place was a nice find for lunch.    Glad to have my Pakistani/Indian Yelpie friend present to order as I had no idea what to do.  We got chicken karahi, goat biryani, chicken tikka masala, and chickpeas with some naan to share.  Food came out looking looking very homey and overall tasted very good.   The karahi was by far the best - very tender and moist chicken that I mopped up with naan.  Tikka Masala was also tasty and had a nice kick (you can adjust spice levels).  The rice:goat ratio on the biryani was high and while I usually like goat, this was a bit gamey and dry.   Service was slow given there weren't many other diners at the restaurant.  However, portions were huge and very reasonably priced.  Total bill was $44 for 4  and we left stuffed with 4 full boxes of leftovers.   I would come back for more karahi and to try some other dishes. Probably for dinner though as the food is pretty heavy for lunch.

Burger quality is great and these things are massive. I ordered a 5oz but was brought, and charged for, a 10oz.  If you have a normal-person appetite, split the 10oz with someone for a reasonably priced meal.  The fries were pretty awful though. They should be hot and crispy; these were not. Sweet potato tots also seemed like they had been sitting out for a while. I like my tots with extra crunch. The beach setting was a bit forced and over-the-top...cmon you're sitting in the middle of the desert! Put some good games on the screens instead of electronic fish swimming around.

Chanpen would probably be a four-star place in LA or SF, but we're in the desert and it's easily the best Thai food I've had in Phoenix. It's a very small place and you shouldn't expect anything fancy. The family that runs the place is very friendly. I tried the chicken larb, pad thai, and panang curry. The meat in larb was a bit dry but the flavors of all the dishes were on point and done very well. They will authentically spice it up for you if that's what you want so be careful with the heat scale. Complimentary dessert (we got green tea ice cream) is always appreciated. Check Chanpen out if you haven't for Thai. I think the difference between their food and other popular spots in town is quite noticeable.

Great for happy hour on a warm evening, but I don't think I'd be here for the regular menu. It's more like Cali/Tex-Mex than authentic Mexican food. Server was a really ditzy blonde that needed some extra brain power but she made for good people (er...person) watching?

A quickie version of one of my favorite restaurants. Smoked salmon salad is still the way to go if you have the discipline of avoiding their carb-loaded goodies: pizza, pastries, gelato, etc. etc.  I hung around for some beers before a delayed flight. I'd avoid the red wine though; it was corky and pretty terrible. Small disappointment in an otherwise great airport option.

Stopped in for breakfast and left a happy camper.  I love toasted breads and the outer crust of this sandwich was cooked/paninied/whatever-they-do perfectly. I really enjoyed the 33 but wish the egg yolk was left a little runny...not sure if that's possible with these sandwiches. I also sampled the 44 but did not like it as much. The egg ratio was way too much and I was hoping to see more crispy bacon. Breakfast prices are reasonable but if lunch portions are the same, then I'd be a bit more hesitant.

This is a dance club? LOL. Guess a place can't determine the crowd that comes in...or can it??  I'll bring extra money to play the games next time. Maybe I'm just antisocial but having a bathroom for me to pee in while strolling through downtown at night was the best part. Zing!

Friendly staff and nicely sized portions. The combo is very affordable and can be split with a few friends. Food is tasty but some of the meats seemed dry - either overcooked or from too many reheatings.

Great staff and great food. Enough options to have some variety each visit...or you can just stick to your favorite combos. My mouth's watering just thinking about today's lunch.  I'll definitely be back.

This place looks a bit shady from the outside, and maybe even from the inside. But the service is friendly, the food is good, and the price is reasonable. I ate the water-boiled fish which had awesome flavor but was not spicy enough. Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce was as expected.  Portions were large and I have a big box chillin' in the fridge for lunch tomorrow.

I read so many great reviews before trying this place out but wasn't blown away by the food. Still, it's nice to see a local joint with friendly staff instead of the mega chains taking over.  OBH has fresh-squeezed orange juice and you get a free refill on it. Their hash browns and sausages are very good. I found the french toast to be a bit hard and stale, which was disappointing.  And they don't have my all-time favorite breakfast item: eggs benedict.

Good prices for well-crafted drinks in a nice setting. Haven't tried their food but it did look good. The place is in a strip mall with not much else around and might be far for the Central Phoenician. They were probably understaffed, but the server was very sincere and apologetic. I'd be back if in the area.

The storefront and location are unassuming but walk in to find a sleek and modern setup. You won't find any of the typical labels here. Want Nike, Ray-Ban, Prada, Gucci? This isn't your store. Instead, you'll be shown several incredibly sexy, unique brands with different frames and materials to match your face shape, fashion interests, and budget (although tbh, the prices can get quite high for several options).    Even better than the selection, the team here is fantastic. I've been having regular eye exams and swapping out new rims/contacts for over 20 years. Brian and Dr. Angela truly make the experience. They are patient and offer their honest opinion on how different frames suit you. I really appreciate their no-pressure customer service and they were not annoyed with me trying on every frame in the store. Such a relief when compared to some other offices obviously just trying to maximize profits.  Definitely check them out for your ocular needs. I didn't even need new glasses...I recently did Lasik (not perfectly corrected, still some astigmatism) but still had vision credit from my insurance to use up. Glad I did so here!

Reminds me of Vietnamese sugarcane and drinks/desserts found back home in San Jose (that's a good thing!). They took a while for our drinks to come out though, so minus a star for speed considering there wasn't a line or anything.

I've tried a few drinks and shaved snow since my first visit a while back. Even though it's farther from my house, I like this place over Snoh on Camelback. Great portions and no frills here. Snoh acts like it's so trendy/hip with something to prove. I like the pennywort/mung bean drink, but have to ask for less mung bean because the pasty texture is a little too much for me.

Food is probably a 3.5 but I'm rounding up to support my people's small businesses.  I ordered a rice dish and it had pretty authentic flavors but the thit nuong (grilled pork) was too dry.  I love Vietnamese egg meatloaf (cha) and the little piece I had was good but not warmed up enough. The bi (shredded pork skin) was very good and reminded  me of home. I had a sample of the pho broth and thought it had too much anise flavor without the depth of the meat bones.  Not sure if I'd eat pho if I came back but there are other dishes that looked good like banh xeo and papaya salad with liver and beef jerky, which i haven't been able to find anywhere else in AZ! Prices are also a little more than I'd except from a Viet restaurant.

Now HERE is were the benny's are at. Perfectly poached eggs, a killer hollandaise sauce, and enough variety of flavors for you to mix and match.  You get two bennys and hash browns per order. The portions look small when the plates arrive, but they will definitely fill you up.  Granted, my friend and I also got a plate of pancakes to share along with his own entree. And our mimosas. And beermosas (With FRESH OJ, mind you. I loathe minute maid and concentrate junk). But it's ok because their prices aren't outrageous like some other bfast spots so you can go ahead and order whatever the heck you want. The spuds were great although a little carb heavy. The pancakes have a nice crispy exterior and a smooth fluffy interior. This probably will be my go-to breakfast joint!  Food is definitely worth the wait. Just anticipate that when timing your arrival and estimated eat time. Plus there's nordstrom rack, trader joes, and whole foods for you to peruse while waiting for the text saying your table is almost ready.

Fun vibe and great staff. We came for happy hour and sat at a booth in their indoor/outdoor dining room. Free chips and salsa all night long. Drinks ranged from good to great. Love the $5 mini-pitchers. I forgot how much I like the San Tan Epicenter, which I used to order from Postino next door.  Some of the cocktails were a little sweet for my liking but they offered good pours. The aguas frescas tasted good too but I had to ask for some extra kick from the not-as-strong liqueurs. Can't say anything about food other than it seemed overpriced. Irrelevant side note: I really enjoyed the wheel knobs on the bathroom sinks.

The pizzas were similar to other good neapolitan pizzas I've had. I wouldn't say among the best but I'd come back if someone wanted to go. I think they skimped on basil for one pizza but did good with arugula on another. Two friends ordered tomato soup, and they both really liked it. One picked up the bowl and slurped it clean. Owner? comes around and offered some treats at the end of our meal which was a nice touch.   The restaurant is not large and I can imagine there'd be a wait during peak hours.   Not a 5-star experience because: parmesan and oregano were brought out after a whole pizza was already eaten, staff looked really tired/disgruntled when they walked around, and the bathroom was pretty dirty with towels all over the floor. Not big deals but things for the restaurant to work on.

Great location with a nice patio and view of Camelback mountain.  Wide selection of unique beers. The wings I had were pretty good. I wasn't hungry enough to order the huge burger that looked awesome as it kept passing by. Enough tv's to catch a game. Downside was that service was slow enough to be kind of annoying. Other than night, nice place to come chill for a little bit.

Fun little place with great service. I had the Lady which was really good and the naan surprisingly works really well. The accompanying salad was a nice side but too overdressed and small in portion. My only complaint is that I was still hungry after my $10 dog! I could get 4 polish sausages and 4 sodas at costco for that price. I know, not in the same boat...but just saying.

I normally don't have a sweet tooth but this banana cream pie definitely hit the spot. None of that corporate, mass-produced-in-grocery-store-or-factory-somewhere  nonsense.  Good thing I don't live too close or else I'd be fat and broke (oh, wait...maybe too late for that).  Great pies to wash down those dogs next door. Will stay a 5 if the other flavors are as good.

This Whole Foods is smaller than many other WF's I've been to but it's new, clean, and sufficiently stocked...for now. I think the parking lot is too small for it. The bar inside is a neat addition with daily drink/food specials. I rarely ever buy anything from Whole Foods. I just like to walk around feeling important as if I've done something with my life allowing me to afford buying groceries here (none of these is true). I then hopped over to TJ's next door to get what I actually needed.

The guys who run this place are great but the coney itself didn't blow me away. It's pretty small for the price and I actually enjoyed eating the fries more than the dog. Check in on Yelp for a meal discount. I guess i'm more of a $1.50 Costco Polish kind- of-guy.

They don't have a sign on top so look for signage in the window. The place is in the LA Fitness plaza. Tables were full throughout my lunchtime visit on a Sunday. Pretty solid food. We ordered the following:  Tendons in chili oil: Great texture and spicy chills. A little bit too oily, but it hit my tendon craving. FYI, tendon may look like, but  is NOT, fat.  Stinky tofu: definitely not for the non-adventurous palate/nose. Smells kind of like you're at a farm...Nonetheless, I still ate my half of the dish without problems. Xiao long bao (XLB, soup dumplings): A little too dry for my taste. Ask for a soup spoon to eat the traditional way with some vinegar and/or soy sauce. They should serve this with sliced ginger.  3 cup chicken: Hearty, satisfying dish. Lots of chicken cooked down in a wonderful sauce reminiscent of home-cooked family meals. Only downside was the very bony chicken.   We didn't order any noodle dishes but they looked quite tasty at neighboring tables. Prices looked reasonable on the menu but came out to just under $20/person with tax and tip. Maybe we were just hungry and ordered a lot? I will be back, maybe on a weekday lunch where they offer 4 dishes for the price of 3 (cheapest item comped).

Cozy little place in an unassuming strip joint with some equally good culinary neighbors. It's new with the typical Phoenician menu of salads, pizzas, beers (what's up with that in Phoenix??), but they also have some unique items as well.  Definitely worth a try in your restaurant line up.

Glad I stopped by during restaurant week to take advantage of the deals. I like that they offered most of their regular dinner entrees with the same portion size.  Duck meatloaf was a bit gamey and pretty heavy. The scallops and rockfish special, though, were on point! Service was so-so. We asked our busboy for a lot of things and he happily helped us out. Don't know what happened to our actual waiter throughout the meal.  Clientele seemed a little stuffy, but this is the Biltmore area so I shouldn't be surprised. I'd maybe come by for happy hour, but not full dinner service.

Great patio to hang out at when it's not too cold out. And even if it is cold, they have plenty of heat lamps.  Most of my stars are for the atmosphere alone. Very hip/trendy without being pretentious. It's easier to find parking here than at other places downtown. The food menu is a weird mix of everything with so-so execution. None of the appetizers we ordered were particularly rave-worthy. Reasonable prices on beer and wine. Service is friendly when they're around. We did have to wave servers down a few times throughout the night. Come for happy hour of half-off wine bottles on Sunday.

Best sushi spot around. The caveat is that this is 5-stars, for Phoenix. I haven't been a fan of many other sushi places with Bei probably a distant 2nd. Harumi is very casual and offers friendly service with fresh and fast food. The portions are filling. My friend and I ordered two combo plates ($15 each) and left more than stuffed.

Prices have gone up and quality of food has gone down, along with sizes of the sashimi cuts and sushi rolls. My last visit here was on Superbowl weekend. First we were told we couldn't be seated. About a 1/4 of the place had reserved placards but some reservations weren't until 30 minutes after. As we were about to leave, I guess the hostess changed her mind and pulled two tables together for my party of 6. I've been here many times and have never felt so rushed during a meal. This used to be my favorite sushi spot in Phoenix, but I left disappointed after taking out-of-town friends here. Oh, and I think they took off their check-in offer of miso soup and edamame.

The Whining Pig really is a local gem. It's a very cozy place and I hope all these stellar reviews won't draw too much attention to overcrowd the place. Greg is great behind the counter. The drink selection is pretty impressive.  The prices, and their hours offered, are hard to beat.

This is the best Vietnamese food I've had in the Phoenix area. They have a limited menu but most of the dishes are done well. I sampled banh xeo, pho, bun bo hue, banh cuon, and bun thit nuong. I would order any of those again here. The service is a bit slow for Vietnamese food, but the prices are fair.  To be more authentic, I would suggest they add banana blossom to their BBH and offer ngo gai (culantro) to their pho herbs. I would come much more often if I lived close by. The food is much better than any of the Viet places in Central Phoenix.

Best Viet food in the Valley. They've expanded the menu a little bit since opening. Love the banh cuon and anything with thit nuong (bbq pork). I've never had it too dry like at other places, and it's properly charbroiled with great flavor. I don't mind driving from Central Phoneix to get here for good food.

Prices have gone up and quality of food has gone down. Pho broth is very sweet here. The last time I went, they admitted they forgot to season the bun bo hue broth, but they still served it to us anyway?? The thit nuong also tastes not as good as it used to be. I used to to make the drive here for good Viet food...but now probably only if it's convenient.

Sit in the sun with a sangria pitcher and potato chips during happy hour for a nice escape from reality. Fresh veggies with double dip were also very good. Burger was juicy but had too much relish. Food prices are typical for the LGO/Postino corner.

You can't come here and not compare it to the o.g. Boiling Crab. Whether the owners like to admit it or not, it's pretty much an exact replica...and that's not a bad thing.  I've been craving this kind of food so badly since moving to AZ and finally got a chance to hit up the Angry Crab. The food is awesome. Spray ketchup on the table and eat with your hands while butter, garlic, and grease slop all over your face. Not an ounce of shame. Flavors are perfect. Food is hot. Spice levels are SPICY. Shrimp were large and not overcooked. Fries are perfectly crisp. Blue crab is kind of hard to eat but if you like crab guts and like to work for your food, it's worth it. Crawfish was sold out when I went so I can't comment on quality. I hope they don't raise their prices and somehow keep the 2-3 hour BC waits away. Shout out to our server Michelle, who was great and full of energy on a busy day. Protip: the sauce here is great bowel care, if you get what I mean.

Some servers here are pretty awful and need to take a lesson on 1) writing down correct orders and 2) keeping track of what food's been brought out and what hasn't and 3) not arguing with customers when errors are pointed out.  Given that, food is still good. Will see how Hot and Juicy in Tempe compares.

Awesome place to people watch. I stopped by for a few drinks and sat on the front patio facing Camelback. Really fun to watch beautiful, fancy-looking people come in and out of the place. I called ahead about happy hour and was told 4-6:30 $5 wells and $2 off cocktails, wine and beer. Turns out it was just 4-6pm and $2 off draft beers and wine. But the wine list doesn't show which are on tap so good luck with that.  My waitress also tried to convince me we that ordered a round of drinks after the 6pm cutoff. She gave some attitude and made it seem like a big deal having the manager make the price change.  Unfortunately for her, I had closed another bill at the bar just after we had ordered said round of drinks and the time stamp was 5:52pm. I circled that time on the receipt and left it with my tip.   I was really liking this place and she kind of ruined the mood for me. I told her I wasn't trying to be cheap ($2, no big deal) but I like to receive the correct price for something I order and not be lied to about it.  I've yet to try the food but will update this review once I make a return visit.

The folks that work here are awesome and really make this an experience. Don't come if you're expecting a quick lunch. I arrived around 11:10 on a weekday and waited about 45 minutes to order. They let you sample all the different cuts before you make a decision.  Most of the bbq was pretty good, but didn't reach "my eyes rolling back in their sockets" amazing which is what I expected after these reviews.  The pastrami was very dry and salty. Fatty brisket was the best cut for me followed by the sausage of all things. The sides tasted like they had been cooked and were sitting out for a while - not impressed. Overall, Little Miss is worth checking out at least once. For me, it wasn't above and beyond some other local offerings....and definitely pales in the nationwide bbq hunt.  Seems like they've got a good following though so my chip in the reviews shouldn't hurt too much.

I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and prefer to have ice cream over gelato or sorbet. But this place is pretty damned good. They have so many flavors and don't mind if you take your time trying out as many as you'd like. I was overwhelmed by the array of options. Service was wonderful for their first day. My friends and I were sitting outside after our order. Staff even came out to offer us water and more samples of their gelato. What kind of dessert place does that? FROST does. And it helps that portion sizes are pretty generous.
