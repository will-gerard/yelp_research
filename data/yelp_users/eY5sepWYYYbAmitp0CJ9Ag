For anyone who is a fan of Mexican food- you must try Los Dos Molinos.  I LOVE spicy food, and it's hard for me to find a place that has salsa that is spicy enough for my taste buds...  that is until I found this amazing place.  Their salsa is not for the faint of heart- so beware- also no free refills on the salsa, but it's worth paying extra for, in my opinion.  The margaritas are yummy- they don't douse it in sweet and sour mix and lime juice.  Service is not great but not horrible either. I just go for the food- which is what restaurants should be about anyways.

I am simply writing this review to let you know to shop here ONLY if you want the shittiest service of your life.  Staff here is BEYOND rude and have sticks up their ass.  Sure- you were probably hired because you're hot, but do your damn job and help the customers out instead of standing at the register and rolling your eyes at every customer who walks in.  You work at an American Apparel...... please get real.

I love this location of Takamatsu.  I frequented this location A  LOT when I used to live in PHX.  As far as Korean restaurants go- we all know that they aren't known for their remarkable service. This location of Takamatsu is the exception.  Korean food here is really tasty for PHX standards, but the reason why my boyfriend and I kept coming back here aside from location was because of the service.  Every time we came here, the servers were very attentive and SUPER friendly. Even if they were deep in the weeds, they still managed to remain alert to our table- or at least apologize if they forgot something (which rarely happens at Korean restaurants).  They are far from cheap when it comes to their ban chan (side dishes).  The servers here work really hard, and I know you would have a great dining experience if you decide to check this place out.

I stayed in one of the penthouse suites here back in April of 2010 for a friend's bachelorette party.  I loved how the penthouse lounge offered free gourmet snacks and unlimited wine, beer, and most any type of liquor. Always a plus in my books.  Our check in was very fast, and the concierge, staff, and host took great care of us.  The hotel is gorgeous and I love the restaurants they had to offer.  The only problem I had was at one of the bars- one of the bartenders was BEYOND rude and condescending. I did something I've NEVER done before and that was to speak with his manager.  The manager apologized for his rudeness and offered a free round of drinks for my friend and me- which I politely declined because that's NOT the reason why I complained.  Other than that minor bad experience, I had a lot of fun here.  Haze is a great club- a bit pricey- even for vegas- (Cmon 18 dollars for a jager shot?) and the pool is an equally fun place to hang out. Both the club and pool play great music.  I'll definitely want to stay here next time I go to Vegas.

This is probably one of my favorite restaurants that I've ever been to- not exclusive to just Phoenix. Who can say no  to carbs and alcohol????  They have a very extensive wine list and their cocktails are delicious as well. Some of their cocktails take a bit of time, but that's because everything is freshly squeezed.   I've tried some of their sandwiches here and they definitely don't hold a candle to their bruschetta and other appetizers. Try "the plate" from Postinos- a blend of peppers, salami, asparagus, olives, etc.  The staff here is super friendly, helpful, non pretentious, and good looking! You get a bit of a hipster vibe here.   Mondays are a great night to go here after 8 for their special : 20 dollars for their bruschetta and a bottle of wine!   I miss living down the street from this place.

Yum yum yum!  Great place for burgers, drinks, and a place to watch a game!   The space here is a bit limited, so not great for accommodating large groups.  Their burgers are juicy and their buns are light and crispy- not heavy and soggy with grease.  I prefer here over DeluxBurger.
