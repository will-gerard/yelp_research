I've been going here for two years now and I refuse to let anyone else cut my hair. Ed cuts the best fade I've ever had and he always treats me well. They all know what customer service is supposed to be like and they always deliver.  I even started having Ed cut my 3 yr old son's hair.  He seems to be the only one that can deal with him squirming all over the place.

This was my first time getting a spray tan. I couldn't have had a better experience! Ann did a great job explaining how the process would work and how to make the tan last as long as possible. The prices are some of the best I've seen online and the tan came out perfect! I had a bunch of people ask if I'd been spending time in the sun...nobody had a clue that it was a spray tan. I'm definitely going back!!!

Signing up with Seth and the other trainers at TPT was the best decision I've made in a long time. I've lost a bunch of fat, put on a bunch of muscle, and I'm feeling better physically and mentally than I have in a long time. The workouts are tough, especially at first, but I've never left disappointed.   On top of that, I've made a bunch of good friends. The other people in the gym are so encouraging and positive it makes you want to go back. We all hold each other accountable!

This is my second review of Thurston Personal Training and I still can't say enough good things. You train with small groups of people ranging from 1-10. It's a really close-knit family and everyone is incredibly encouraging. I've lost over 40lbs of fat and gained more than 10lbs of muscle. My clothes fit better and my confidence is through the roof. I'm stronger than I've ever been and I look better than I ever have, even when I was running marathons.   It's worth every last penny! I guarantee you won't regret it!!!

Absolute best fish tacos! I've tried a few of the other options here and they were all good but the fish tacos are my favorite. The serving sizes were also bigger than I expected.

Justin, the manager is ridiculous. I was here for a birthday party and we were given bad instructions. The birthday boy was made to wait for a half hour before using the eurobungee jumper. They then refused to let him on because he didn't have the right card, despite being told it wouldn't be a problem by another staff member.   When we explained the problem to Justin he was rude and unwilling to listen to reason. He was just being jerk for absolutely no reason. $600 for a kid's birthday and they don't let him jump on a damn trampoline! Needless to say they've lost out on our business for good. This guy needs to be fired.
