I have been taking my 2 Lhasa Apsos to Dr. Stevens since they were pups.  They will be 11 on 10/23.  I was referred to Sunburst by the breeder.  I do have to say that I have never been disappointed with this hospital.  They are always busy, but they get the job done.The front desk and vet tech girls seem to be the same employees since I started taking my dogs there.  They all are very knowledgable, caring and seem to love what they do.  Dr. Stevens is a wonderful caring person as it shows in his passion for his job.  I had to keep one of my babies there for 4 days and they were so wonderful and got her back to health.  I highly recommend Dr. Stevens.  If u can't get in with him, know you should feel good about any other vet in this office.

I ordered chicken and hummus to go as I had just gotten off a flight from San Jose.  My expectations would have been the norm which consisted of fresh moist chicken with regular and spicy hummus. Unfortunately, The chicken was subpar. It looked like dog food from out of the can and a few chunks of chicken which were not fresh. I expected freshness as the time was approximately 1 o'clock in the afternoon, with a full house of customers. Most of the pieces were hard and rubbery and the rest of it just tasted old.  The hummus was fine, just as my palate craved it.   I was disappointed and contemplate going back to Pita Jungle.  If I decide to go back it would be for something other than chicken.

I have been a customer of  Matt's poop up for about five years.  I became spoiled to this service as he did a much better job than I!  He is professional and extremely thorough! My backyard is immaculate by the time he is done doing the clean up service I would highly recommend this company to do business with!  You will not be disappointed!
