Best breakfast I've ever had in a restaurant. Everything is amazing and the staff is always sweet. One of my favorite breakfast spots! Try the French toast!

Favorite Indian food in AZ. The staff is friendly, my father is a regular and they know him by name. Buffet is so good, and it tastes so flavorful. The naan is also very good and my favorite.

If you like frozen yogurt....go here. No kidding. I don't even really enjoy frozen yogurt because it's too icy feeling for me. Less flavor than ice cream obviously, but this place changed my mind. This little gem is hidden next to a dunkin donuts. The creamiest, flavorful yogurt I've ever had. I brag about this place still, and I don't live around here anymore. If you're in the area GO! :)

If I could give this no stars I would. I went through the drive thru, ordered a Big Mac combo meal. I opened it and it was soggy. It had definitely been sitting around. My fries were literally half filled. And the big mac had no sauce. I walked in and politely asked them to add sauce. The manager (or whoever it was) told the cashier to inform me that there would be extra charge. First of all, I ordered it WITH sauce. I informed the cashier (since the manager refused to talk to me) that I wasn't  about to pay extra for something done right that I ordered. Nobody was in there when I walked in. So it shouldn't be a problem right? I told them that I work at a mcdonalds, and this isn't how customers should be treated, especially because I was so calm about it. The cashier finally comes back and says, "they put a lot of sauce" and threw the box at me practically. I didn't take a picture but no exaggeration but it was literally COVERED in sauce. I had to use 8 napkins to wipe the sauce off and even then I couldn't even wipe off the excess. So annoying. I called in and asked politely to talk to the manager just to let them know, and they hung up on me. This experience was ridiculous.
