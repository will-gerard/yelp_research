We went through GrubHub to have Graziano's deliver to us.  They arrived within a half hour and the delivery driver was incredibly friendly - kudos to the man with the long beard who didn't make me feel rushed to get my food inside and tip him! We got garlic bread with spaghetti and meatballs. The bread was soft and fresh and it was not overly greasy with butter.  Their marinara sauce is also very flavorful - I could have eaten the the garlic bread with sauce for dinner and been quite content.  My only complaint was the meatballs. They had absolutely no flavor to them and we ended up throwing them away.  Otherwise, the food was great! We'll be trying their pizza next time.

We had adopted a kitten from the humane society and were advised to go here because the initial check-up would be free.    The appointment took over two hours and when we finally did leave, we were given medication that we were not instructed how to use. I would rather pay a little money to have veterinary staff that is going to take the time to review things with us.  We will be searching for another vet and not coming back to this location.

I don't go anywhere else for Chinese food ever since deciding to give Ginger a try.  The food is always excellent (definitely try the Chicken Lo Mein!) and the service is fast. I don't know where the reviews about dirty dishes all over the place are coming from... It is always spotlessly clean in and the waitress is on top of keeping beverages filled and taking orders.

My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner.  He is a huge fan of Benihana and I have never had any sort of teppenyaki before so we decided to give it a try.  On a Tuesday at 5pm, we were both surprised that there was only one other patron in the restaurant.  The staff was incredibly attentive - our glasses were rarely even close to empty and they checked on us fairly regularly.  We also received complementary edamame as an appetizer and coffee cake as a dessert.  Both were absolutely delicious.  Our main meal was of decent quality - if the portions had not been large, it would not have been worth the cost (which is similar to Benihana).  I did, however, take home enough food for lunch tomorrow which made it worth it in my opinion.  We did not order any alcoholic beverages but a quick glance at the menu showed a decent selection of beer and wine, all for a very fair price, especially if you go during happy hour.   Overall, I wish I could give 3.5 stars but given that the staff went above and beyond, I will round up instead of down.  I would certainly consider going back - again, the cost v. quality is the only reason I would overlook Osaka.

I am very leery of nail salons due to prior bad experiences with cleanliness.  In fact, I lived in Phoenix for nearly a year before a friend finally convinced me to try out Lish Nail Salon.  Let me just say that this place is wonderful.  The staff and owner are incredibly friendly.  You are offered a water upon walking in the door and they don't mind making conversation with you if you want.  Most importantly, they are clean.  Liners for the tubs are changed in between each pedi and they open a new package of tools each time.  I highly recommend them - I definitely won't be going anywhere else.

If you have to get CenturyLink, go through this location. Do not call their customer service people to set up service.  I made that mistake and two days after I was suppose to have my service turned on, it still hasn't been turned on. Technicians show up whenever they want, without regard to when they said they would or they just don't show up at all.  They also do not call. Calls to the 1-800 number last over an hour because those individuals are useless and don't . The people at Arrowhead Mall are significantly more friendly, understanding, and helpful.  Despite this, if my apartment complex had Cox, I would go to them in a heart back.

Sammiches is wonderful!  The service, the food, everything is great.  I had the Tasty Turkey sandwich without bacon.  The bread was light and fluffy, not dense like sandwiches made elsewhere.  It made the bread to turkey to cheese ratio perfect.    My only complaint is that I work while they are open so I have only had the opportunity to eat here once.  Hopefully their new location will have longer hours so I can indulge more frequently!
