We went there on a Saturday evening. It was packed, but we only waited for a minute before being seated. the service was fast. The staff was polite. The pizza was very good. I wouldnt say that it was the best that I ever had.... because Deluca's Pizza in Lansing, Michigan is the best.... but overall, we were very pleased with Spinatos. We will definately return.

Unfortunately, the trip to India gate restaurant in chandler was a waste of time. The only good thing was that we had a buy one get one free coupon. The staff stood at the bar and stared the entire meal. They even brought us items off of the buffet... and we didn't order the buffet. i expected my food to be freshly prepared... all of it. even the naan. Maybe we hit them on a bad night. None-the-less, we wont be back.

I usually call ahead and am always told to come right  over. I never have to wait. Everyone is very friendly and the male manager does the best pedicure and french. Spa pedicures are $18 with $5 extra for french.  The polish usually lasts until your next pedi (which for me is 4-6 weeks).

So, we were on our way home today from our trip to Sedona. Every time we pass by this place I suggest we stop. I read the reviews today on my trusted blackberry and we decided to give it a try.  They were not kidding about the food there. It was awful!!! The service in the bar area was horrible. The waitress didn't want to work and was irritated when we asked if she was going to take our order.  The food took forever, thus our Philly cheese steak and fries were cold. The caeser salad arrived with minimal, I mean minimal dressing. When we asked for more dressing, the waitress said "we are out of that". I questioned how they could send a caesar salad out of the kitchen when they knew that they were out of dressing. This made absolutely no sense to me. NONE. There was no one working to complain to so we paid our $35.00 and left. Did I mention that I had sometime black in the bottom of my beer mug. I gave them 1 star, the pie was edible.

We come here about once or twice a month for happy hour or to catch a game. Great happy hour specials and there are tons of tv's to watch. I especially like it for the off track horse race betting. Since I don't spend all of my money on food and beer, I have a little extra to gamble away.

In Peoria, this is where we love to go to for sushi. The bar tenders are friendly. The prices are not too bad. My niece loves the chicken here. If you come during the week there you don't have to wait, and the food is just as good!

Great happy hour food and drink prices. Good service, despite it being all women, they do not ignore female customers.....which we know can be a problem.   The place is full of "regulars" bellied up to the bar. Lots of T.V.s, darts, and beer. The patio is nice if you have a larger group and its not 100+ outside.

Good food. Good service. Tasty sangria.  For a chain restaurant I was happily surprised with the food here. The lettuce wraps and the jambalaya are my favorites.  I like to try different restaurants....but if i ever run out....I'll be back.

I've come here in and off since they opened. The only place in my 30 trips to Vegas that I've ever really won some money. A nice selection of games and slots available. The dealers are nice and helpful. If you join the players club you receive great offers on rooms....sometimes the rooms are free! A little bit of a drive from the strip but a great place to gamble and possibly win something.

OK, its in a strip mall....but what isnt?  I absolutely love this place for Indian food. The staff is friendly and the service is fast. The madras chicken melts in your mouth! We seriously lapped up every bit of the gravy with our naan. This wasn't the only dish that was fantastic. Everything was very good. Definitely one of the best places for Indian food in the valley (east and west).

I am a huge hockey fan from Michigan. So of course I have to go to see the Red Wings when they come to town. I was impressed with the arena. Of course its not Joe Louis, but it was the right temperature and had adequate restrooms for the ladies. The prices are what you expect them to be when you go to a concert or sporting event. I plan on going back tonight to see the Coyote's play the Stars. This time maybe they will win.

Stayed in the pyramid. Needs remodeling(these rooms do). Towers rooms I hear have been remodeled. Lines to check in are ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. They need to change this. Casino is ok. Restaurants are okay. Fair prices. Not happy that the back pool was not open until noon. I went in the middle of July and found this very inconvenient, as wells as did the other guests at the pool.

I went here the second time that I got my nose pierced. They were very informative. I didn't know that they suggest having them change the ring instead of fighting to put a new one in.  After having my rings a month I lost it. I went in and they gave me the discounted jewelry price and put the ring back in . No problem. I started getting a little bump and was told that I needed to soak it in warm salt water more often. he was right. the bump is gone....it took a month, but its gone. I highly recommend HTC!

Everything was great....except next time, Ill order my meal "hot". The medium spice just didn't cut it.

OK, so I am writing this review for my boyfriend. Gentleman Joe's is the ONLY place he will go to get his haircut in the entire valley. He drives all the way from Peoria just to get a hair cut. He loves the attention he gets from the barbers. I believe he enjoys it as much as women enjoy going to the spa! I went in to pick him up one day and saw him getting a shave with a straight razor, just like in the movies! He also had his own private television set to watch as he got his hair cut!!! Maybe I'll send him there for valentine's day.... bet he would then volunteer to do anything I wanted to do. :)
