Who doesn't enjoy a day at the zoo! I took my boys here to just enjoy a lazy Sunday. The crowds weren't bad at all and since this weather has been amazing, the animals were out and about. Word of advice, bring in your own water and snacks because they can be a bit pricey there. The camel rides are fun for children and the tickets are only 5 bucks per person! This is a very clean and well kept zoo, you'll enjoy seeing tons of animals from all over the world. Overall, this was a very fun experience!

The crispy beef tacos here are really really good. Take it from someone who knows tacos. They don't skimp on the beef and they give you just the right amount of lettuce. You know how some places will bombard you with lettuce to make it look like it's this amazingly huge taco and when you bite into it, you're left thinking WTH? I'm I being punked? Not here.    I should have taken pictures of my crispy beef tacos and buttered tortilla, but my hunger go the better of me and now I'm ashamed. I think I inhaled the food, I'm still unsure. I wanted to show you all just how great they look, but alas, I can't. You're going to have to try this for yourselves. Take the journey here or forever regret it.

I had to ship back my broken cell phone, so everything was all ready to go with a prepaid label and everything. I was greeted as soon as I walked in, which is always nice to see. The staff was moving really fast, but were super efficient. I was in and out in a jiffy. They had some pretty cool pens there and I picked up one because I needed a replacement purse pen.  Come on in and use these guys for all of your shipping needs!

Amazing place! I walked out to my car and realized I had a flat, since this place is so close to my place, I drove it there for assistance. This was on a Saturday, so they were pretty busy, I explained my situation to the guy working there and he informed me that there were several cars in front of me and if I was dropping my car off. I told him that I couldn't because I had errands to run. The manager on duty told the guy to put my car ahead of the others because mine wasn't a drop off and wouldn't take long at all as it was just to fix a flat. I was super thankful as he didn't have to do this! He really cared and went above and beyond. If you check in on Yelp, they'll give you free wipers! YAY! They were fast and friendly. While I waited, I had some of their complementary coffee and watched some tv. Will totally use these guys again!

I have lived here for several years and I don't have one negative thing to say about this complex or the staff. The staff has always been quick to answer any questions and the maintenance crew does the job well too. It's quiet and I'm very lucky that my  neighbors are respectful to others. I highly recommend living here.

Let me start off with saying that Robert and Erik are the best waiters here. If you happen come here make sure you ask to be sat in their sections. They're fast and friendly.   I'm huge waffle fan. I've been to many places in search of the perfect Belgian Waffle. I've been to locally owned places as well as chains in search of a waffle that knocks my socks off. I have found that place. The waffles are delicious with the edges a bit crispy.  Mimi's has these amazing potatoes too, I highly recommend them. If you want a great waffle, stop by. Your coffee cup will never be empty and your taste buds will thank you.

Carne asada tortas are amazing! The down side is that they always get my order wrong. I keep telling them no salsa on my tacos. Their red salsa is kinda hot so I would like to enjoy my meal without exploding later. No matter what I do, they always add the salsa. I put it with it because the food is so damn good. Not that this has anything to do with the food, but the woman who is always up at the register looks like she rolled out of bed and didn't shower. Her bra straps are always showing and it looks really unprofessional. It's kind of gross actually. If she is the first and/or only person the customers are going to see, I think she should at least look more presentable. She is representing the restaurant. Other than that, the food is amazing!

This is a great family owned place. I have been coming here for a few years. They have always been very friendly and their prices are great. The lady also does alterations and is really good at it. She fixed a dress for me that was too long and took off a strap for only 40 bucks. I take my comforter here because unfortunately it's dry clean only. They take great care of it and always do the job right. A+

This is the only pizza place I will dine in or order take out from. I'm very picky about what I eat; a total food snob. I love their pizza! I always order their pepperoni and mushroom deep dish pizza!! The servers are always friendly and the prices are very reasonable. You can't go wrong here, everything is good!

This is my go-to place for dinner when I'm pressed for time or just don't really feel like cooking. My family really likes their garlic sauce to dip their pizza in. The downside is that each sauce is .75 cents each. They deliver! That saves me so much time, there is a two dollar charge for that. Tip the driver because that doesn't go towards their tip!

I've always been a fan of their happy hour. Can't go wrong with their drink specials! I'm a huge fan of their pork gyoza and edamame. Great for lunch too! Ironic, since I hate all sea food, this is one of my favorite places.

I was here because my friend was having a baby. Of course I couldn't wait to see the little one, so I had to go visit. When I walked in, I noticed that the hospital was clean. I was paying attention because someone that I cared about was there and I wanted to make sure they were in a nice clean place. I noticed that the nurses were very attentive and caring. They helped my friend out so much! Nothing but a pleasant experience here.

This place reminds me of a dollar store. The reason I had to stop in was because they carried a toy that my son wanted. Otherwise, I don't think I would have stopped in. Prices aren't all that great either.

Out of all the TJMaxx stores that I've been to, I like this one the most. Yes, it is like any other TJMaxx, it's hit or miss. When I do find some great deals, I walk about with a cart full and a huge smile on my face.

Been coming here for years. I love love love this place!! Their 'The Works' skillet is amazing and so is their French Toast. It's made with a delightful custard batter that can put a smile on anyone's face. To be frank, all of their food is great. The service is stellar too!! You see a lot of the same people. During the week, they have a great breakfast special. There is no reason to come eat here!! Jaime is the best waitress ever!! Ask for her!

Lame overpriced toys. The only reason I stopped by was because my boys wouldn't leave me alone about it. They too were "MEH." The customer service sucked, but in all fairness, I would hate life too if I had to be around kids running around the store and throwing things around and their parents just pretend they don't see what's going on. Wont be coming back.

The keg is a really good steak house for a nice dinner. We went to eat here on a random Friday as a just because dinner. We had the Prime Rib and their au 'jus sauce is really good. I recommend the Caesar salad as the Wedge salad looks really plain. The veggies are really good especially the mushrooms. The bread is really good and holds you over until your food comes. Staff is friendly too!

This place is quite good. I'm a super fan of their Mongolian Steak. The price is really decent and it's a great spot for lunch. You can order online and they'll let you know when it will be done. Huge time saver when you're on your lunch hour. The soda machine brings my dreams to life with their cherry-vanilla Dr. Pepper. Their chocolate chip cookies are pretty good too. If you come during lunch time, this place gets pretty packed and seating may be a problem. Staff is friendly and I have not had a problem at all at this place. Will be coming back!

There isn't a bad thing that I could possibly say about Liberty Market. Liberty Market launches my taste buds into space because their food is out of this world good! The biscuits and gravy are a must try along with an Americano. They also offer foods that are gluten free as well as vegetarian options. Customer service gets an A as well as the cleanliness of the restaurant. Don't leave without trying the Liberty Potatoes!  Parking is not your friend here, so good luck with that. Also, go early because this place gets packed...fast.

Giuseppe's is really one of a kind. As soon as you walk in, you can tell that your experience is going to be great. You're warmly greeted by the staff and they give you a sense that you're almost walking into their home for dinner. That's the vibe that I got because of how welcoming the entire staff was. I had never been here before, but they make you feel as if you've been a regular for years.   The food. My God...the food! You must-I repeat, you must try the eggplant appetizer. Your life as you know it will never be the same. Don't bother wearing socks because they will be knocked off. Luckily, I wore sandals so I was ok. It comes with delicious garlic bread. Who doesn't love garlic bread, right? I got the Pasta Alex. The portion is huge! I had to take some home (it was good even warmed up the next day) It has a bit of a kick to it, not too much where you can't enjoy your meal, but enough to make sure you don't pass out from carb overload. Add this to your must try's.  You can bring your own booze! No more wondering if a place has this or that, you bring what you want! You'll need to sit down for this part. There is no corkage fee!! You read correctly, my friend. No fee. Nada.    You can't leave without trying their sweet treats of deliciousness! The cheesecake is amazing! Everything that they have there is made there. How cool is that?!   You really need to do yourself a favor and check this place out. I will be returning...with stretchy pants.

It's a bit pricey, but I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for. When you're out doing what you love to do, you don't want cheat equipment to fail you.   The staff here is soo amazing. They're the Gandhi of all things outdoors. Trust in them.   This place rocks. *drops mic*

I walked in with my family and we waited to be seated...for 10 min! Employees saw us there and just ignored us and kept going about their business. I fully understand if they're slammed and running around, but a "we'll be right with you" goes a long way and we didn't get any of that. We just got blown off. We were all hungry and this was totally unacceptable. We left and went down the street to Venezia's. They were friendly and wanted our business.

Great prices and I can't argue with that. I am all about saving money and I don't really care what the customers look like. I am there to shop not criticize what the customers and employees look like. I have been coming here for almost 10 years and I have never had a complaint. Management has always helped me out with an issue that I might have had and I have always left the store satisfied.

Look no further for all of your waxing needs! Just ask for Sylvia and she'll take great care of you. She's really fast and talks to you through the whole process. If you book online, you'll get five dollars off. If you check in with Yelp and it's your first time, you'll save 50% on your first Brazilian wax there.

The food here is great! So many sauce combinations to choose from or you can create your own if you're the adventurous type. I always go for the Mongolian with chicken. There's a smorgasbord of veggies and goodies that you can add to your food. The downside is that they charge you for a to go box.

I tried. I really really tried to like Mexican fast food, but sadly, I just couldn't. Taco Bell has this weird aftertaste that I just couldn't get over. The meat. It was the meat that had that funny taste. From now on, I'm only getting veggie stuff there. If anything at all.

If you love soul food, you'll love this!! My personal fave is the Betty Boop. It comes with a waffle and a breast. The portions are big, so bring your appetite! The chicken is out of this world good! The seasonings used are amazing. The sweet tea is to die for as well. You really can't go wrong here. Try the chicken tenders as well. Don't forget to try their grape draaannnk. Will always be coming back here!

This is my favorite spot by far! I wish I actually lived closer to this place so I could come here more often. The staff is really friendly and super helpful. I had asked to see what hops looked like and the manager on duty was kind enough to bring some over to my table and explain the process to me. She was kind enough to take time out of her busy day to answer questions and make me feel like I was the only customer in the room.  The food is delicious! There isn't anything on their menu that I don't like. My favorite is their nachos! Get half chicken and half beef, you'll have the best of both worlds. The beers are so refreshing! My favorite is the Oatmeal Stout. The beer is amazing! It's smooth and finishes with a hint of chocolate. It's super creamy! I think what I really love about this place is that they're always playing great tunes. Staff is great, food is great, beer is great, what's not to love?! I can't think of anything negative, except maybe the parking can be a bit of a hassle. That's not going to stop me from having an amazing time here!! Go check them out now!!

I'm unsure how to review this. I don't care for MasterCuts too much, but Ricky Cherry (Manager) is amazing. He is Picasso and my hair his canvas. He's fast and knows what he's doing. I wouldn't see anyone else there, but you have to go see him. Location isn't that great. It's at AZ Mills. (yikes)

I'm updating this because I again wanted to sing my praises to Ricky Cherry. He is amazing and is the only one I trust with my hair. You could go to more expensive salons, but what's the point of that if you have this amazing man here. I get a lot of my hair products here and I couldn't be happier with my service. Again, you must try Mastercuts and let Ricky Cherry cut your hair. He's the best!

What the heck happened to this place? I used to come here often when I worked close by and the food was always good. This time around, it was lackluster at best. The place looked dirty, dingy. This place looks like it's on life support. It's a shame too, really liked this place before. I hope it pulls through and the owners really step it up.

This is one of my favorite pizza places!! It's a tiny little place with hardly any room, but I think that's what gives it the charm that it has. The pizza is delicious and the girl who normally works the counter is super friendly. They have great lunch specials for those looking for a quite bite. Did I mention how much I love this pizza?

Really happy with my recent trip to Ikea. I bought a chair, desk, and a bookshelf. I was able to put them together myself!! I'm a big girl now! Instructions were easy enough. The actual place was pretty busy, but I didn't let that bother me. I was a woman on a mission. The guy helping with was really friendly and answered all of my questions (which were many, he probably needed a smoke break after dealing with me) and he did it with a smile. I even bought a plant to go with my neat new stuff.   I'm going to be back to look at their lamps and other lighting products. I just didn't have to time on this trip. This gives me a great excuse to come back and have some meatballs!

Ikea is like going on a adventure! Be prepared to spend a lot of time here because they have it all.   I've bought some furniture here and I can't complain about the quality. My kids rooms are full of their furniture and it's taken their abuse, so that's a plus. You can furnish a room for less than a grand...yes, please!!  You can't leave Ikea without at least trying their meatballs once. The other stuff they sell is pretty tasty too. I've never had a complaint about their food.   All in all, you have to at least stop by once!

The food here is really good! They have amazing happy hour deals too. The downside to that is you'll be surrounded by an older crowd. Diners beware: You might end up on a Cougars plate. Our waiter was really nice, friendly, and attentive. I had the Fettuccine Con Pollo & Fungi which was awesome!! Their bread is pretty tasty too! Will be coming back!

I have been coming here for years and I have never once had a problem here. Sure, there are the stupid people who bring in their screaming kids to movies that they have no business in and the morons who insist on using their phones during the movie. No text is that important that you have to be on your phone at the movies. PERIOD. Harkins has no control over that, so I get that. Their popcorn salt makes my toes curl! I love that stuff. Make sure you buy your souvenir cups for the 1.50 refill. It used to be only a buck, but all of their prices have gone up. Overall, I will still continue to come here because it's close to my house and it's just a decent movie theater.

Harkins theater is walking distance so you can do some shopping, dinning, and catch a flick! I highly reccommend this place!

This review is only for their nachos. This place is very close to where I work. More often than not, I'm pressed for time. I will call in my nacho order and swing by and pick them up. I'm a huge nacho fan and would go as far as to say I'm a nacho connoisseur. You can add chicken or beef to your nachos. I personally like the chicken, but add whatever you like. It's your journey. Swing by and try some or if you're like me and are pressed for time, call them in! Enjoy!

Santa Maria de Guadalupe Tortilla de la Machaca! This place is the real deal! It's like Arizona Ave turned into Little Mexico with this gem.   I bought my mom some amazing pan dulce (sweet bread) and let me tell you guys, it was so darn good! Have some with your favorite beverage. I love this with coffee, but milk works too. They have such an amazing tortilla set up. Can't leave without taking a package with you.   Try the chicken salad with Spanish rice. You will love it. I guess everything is pretty darn good.   All in all, they have it all. I want to go to there.

This review is only about their treats of sweet deliciousness. I wanted to do something nice for my work team and thought I would bring in scones and muffins for them.   I was greeted by a sweet guy who was friendly and helpful with my questions. (I had many, I'm sure he was annoyed, but never showed it) The prices are fair for what you get. I have made a mission of mine to go back and have lunch there at some point because the menu looked pretty good.    Everyone at work raved about how good these treats were. I raspberry scone was by favorite. It wasn't too sweet where you'd get a bunch of cavities from eating it, but sweet enough to enjoy with some coffee. You must try their pastries!

I'm torn with giving this place two or three stars, but I'm going to go with two. I really enjoy the yogurt, but here are a few reasons as to why I'm going with two.   The good: I love their yogurt, especially their peanut butter yogurt. They pile it on high and the toppings are delicious too! They put them on the bottom of your cup as well as on the sides.   The bad: It's a bit overpriced considering that there are tons of self-service yogurt places. How are they supposed to stay in business if they can't compete with the prices of other yogurt places? I will have to make a special drive or just go there if I'm out that way because the closest one to me is miles away. They seem to be closing them up around the valley and very few are open and unfortunately  I don't live by one. The inside was a bit dirty and it was empty.

Best locksmith around! I called Jeff because I saw Anthony P's review. My mom misplaced her keys and was locked out of her car and he was very understanding of the situation. He also took the time to help us search her car for them. He also called his buddy who makes keys to get us a quote. Jeff went above and beyond. I hope we wont ever need his services again, but if we do, I wont hesitate to call Jeff again. You should too! You wont be sorry!! Fast, friendly, professional! What more could you ask for??

If I could give Arbor Care Tree Service and Howard a 10 star rating, I would! Howard is the most knowledgeable and patient person ever! He totally knew his stuff and would take the time to explain everything to you. I had contacted him to get an estimate on my tree because it needed a good trimming. He went over either that same day or the next and gave me a quote. Their pricing is probably the best in the valley, no joke. Call them. I dropped the ball and didn't move forward with the trimming right away and a huge part of a tree branch broke off.  Now, my tree would need to be removed. I called him and he gave me a quote for tree removal, which again is the best pricing in town! They removed my tree in about 20 min. Howard and his crew are fast! Arbor Care Tree Service will the ONLY company that I ever call for any tree services I may need in the future.   I can't say enough about Howard and his crew, professional, honest, and friendly! Give them a call now before your tree has to suffer the same fate as mine!

Mindy really helped out my family. I will continue to come here and I think you should too!

I always take my boys school shopping here. I find amazing deals and I'm pretty satisfied with the selections that they have. They have brought in a Sephora as well. I buy a huge chuck of my makeup here and now that it's closer, I am one happy camper. The store was very clean and the staff was friendly.

I love this Safeway! It has the friendliest staff and it's very clean. They have a great mini Starbucks. This is by far my favorite Starbucks. I will actually drive out of my way to stop here for the fast friendly service. The have the best staff there too!  They know my drink and as soon as they see me, they start working on it.

The adult Chuck E. Cheese! Good food and good drinks. Took my son here for his birthday and he had a great time. This is a great place for older kids and their parents to be. Also makes for a great date place. Would come here again for sure!

The staff is really friendly and today I got a free drink with my order. I went to have lunch with a coworker and really wasn't that hungry. I only ordered fries (which are delicious) and the guy was nice enough to give me a drink. Some places will charge you for a glass of water! My coworker raved about his cheesesteak and I have always been a fan of their Buffalo chicken. The portions are large, so they really fill you up. They have a pretty good fry sauce too! This place is really close to where I work so that's a huge plus. Highly recommend this place if you're in the area. Don't leave without trying their cookies!! They're to die for!

This was my first time eating here and I found it to be a very pleasant experience. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. He explained how the process all worked and was very on top of refilling our drinks. My kids really enjoyed being able to make their own bowls and had a lot of fun with it. The meats are fresh and not frozen, there's plenty to choose from as far as topping are concerned. You can sample the sauces to find the one you like the best or you can mix and match. Bottom line was that the food was good, the prices were fair, and the customer service was great. Will be coming back!

Just happened to stop by here to try something a little different. Nothing local is around where I live, so I'm always going to the same coffee places. This was a nice change of pace. I got an Americano and I was great! Try this place!

How on earth did I miss reviewing this place?! This place is an absolute dream! I am so in love with their Potato Cream Cheese soup and the Wild Flower grilled cheese sandwich. Word of caution though, this place is almost always packed. Sometimes seating can be a problem, if you're pressed for time, you might want to call in your order. Pastas are a must try also!

This is by far the best Chinese food I've had here in Arizona. The food is flavorful and the portions are big! Think lunch prices and dinner portions!  I live pretty close to here and we order here more often than I'd care to admit. You must try the Mongolian Chicken dish there! You'll thank me later!

Every Sunday you'll see this Farmers Market without fail. It is pretty small, but it has everything you could want. Fresh fruits and veggies from local farmers and delicious food that local venders have made. I had trouble finding a parking spot, but it might have just been a coincidence since I haven't had trouble finding parking before. It's open from 9-12. You'll also find people selling their crafts. This is a great little jewel in Ahwatukee!

This is a great local bar. It has it all! The DJ is great, always playing some great tracks and there's even a little dance floor for you to shake your booty. The food is really tasty too. Bar food is hit or miss and this place is a real hit! You must try the nachos! They have Ginormousize nachos which are just that, ginormous!! They use real melted cheese not like that gross cheese sauce that other places use. The Mushroom Swiss burger is soo good!! They have daily specials that are only for dine-in and trust me, they're totally special! This place is great to hang out with friends, catch a game, and just have a great time!

Marshawn is amazing!! He helped us and was so knowledgeable and friendly, he made our experience there awesome!   My sons phone gave out on him and he was able to order a new phone and get us on our way in no time. He had the best attitude and humor. If you can have him help you, do it! He's great!   The store was nice and clean too. Will drive out of my way to come to this store from now on. Thanks Marshawn!

Honest, local, and awesome work! I have been taking every car that I've owned to them and they have never let me know. The location sucks big time, but I'm willing to drive into Guadalupe for these people. They have never overcharged me and have always been honest. They're work is great and fast. I highly recommend these guys if you like great quality work and a fair price.

To me, this blows Chipotle out of the water. For one, you won't get sick. Boom. In all seriousness, this place is super good. I suggest getting the steak burrito. The tortillas are fresh and the meat is flavorful, unlike the "other" place where they get your tortillas out of a bag. A bag!   Let's talk about cheese, baby. Let's talk about you and me! The cheese here is super good. It's like you're almost having a religious experience. Don't believe me? Go and try it for yourselves!

Sephora. You complete me. I'm normally on the app, but if I absolutely need something right then and there, I'll come into the store. The staff is beyond awesome and knowledgeable. I thought I knew makeup, but I was nowhere near their level of knowledge. They pretty much have everything you'll ever need!

I brought my mom here to see Dr Beck. He is an amazing doctor who actually cares about his patients. My mom means everything to me, and it means a lot to have a doctor care as much as he does about my mom. The entire staff here is friendly. You can tell that a caring doctors  practices have influenced his entire staff.

My son was stung by a scorpion this past weekend in our living room, so of course I saw this as an act of terrorism and now it's personal. I've declared war. Like with any war, I needed weaponry and lots of it. I visit Bug & Weed Mart because it came highly recommend by a coworker. He knew what he was talking about.   The gentleman who helped me explained everything in great detail. I was confident that I could win the war on terrorism or at least make them go somewhere else. I'd be happy with them going anywhere other than my house. I have no clue what the other people are talking about when they didn't get greeted. This guy was friendly and beyond knowledgeable in all things bug and that makes him A-ok in my book. People need thicker skin.   The weaponry was all that I could have hoped for. The granules that I sprinkled worked like a charm. They were my mini grenades of awesome destruction. I have a blacklight that I take with me nightly outside to go toe to stinger with them. They think my back wall is like a five star resort. Instead of me rolling out the red carpet, I show them my flyswatter. So after I sprinkled the granules, I honestly saw just one and that jerk was in an area that I might not have sprinkled as I should have.   All in all, they sell quality weapons to battle terrorist bugs. I hate doing it myself but in the end it saves you a ton of money and you get the satisfaction of knowing your making your casa a safer place. Use these guys next time! You won't be sorry!

My AC broke and I spent several night here. I couldn't be happier with my experience. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. I can't really say that it was just one person who was nice, it was actually the entire staff. They definitely went above and beyond.   The room was really clean which is important when you have kids. The fridge and microwave were really clean too! Yay for clean stuff!!  If you want to stay in a clean hotel with an amazing staff where you get free breakfast, without breaking the bank, look no further!!

I came here on a Saturday morning, big mistake! It was super packed, but the line moved sort of fast. The bagels of course are always delicious and the service seems to always be friendly. I've been to several different Einsteins and that's pretty much what you're going to get all around. The location is really convenient.  You'll love this place!

When I'm in a rush and I don't have too much time, I pop in here. They have the basics and the prices are reasonable. The store is always clean and I haven't had a staff member be rude. They are always helpful if you have any questions. Lines aren't long or I've just been really lucky!

This place offers dreams and rainbows in a self-serve cup. Each flavor so enticing, so glorious, that it's difficult to choose. My suggestion is to try the coconut. Its flavor transcends space and time. Anyone who didn't love this place, wasn't loved or hugged as a child and I can only pray for your soul.

Dear God!! This is the worst...I repeat...the worst postal workers ever!! Everyone seems to have a package shoved way up there. This weird looking lady with red curly hair is the devil. Beware. She will cuss at you and in front of children. Tried complaining, but her boss is just as bad. I guess they train them that way. What can you do right? Government workers...geez! This is why I will be using any other other way of sending a package instead of these unfriendly people.

I was really hoping to like this place, but it just didn't happen for me. The place was nice and we got seated quickly. We ordered drinks while the rest of the party arrived and those were pretty good. Our waiter seemed nice and friendly in the beginning. We asked him to take a picture of my friend and I and he took a selfie first. Seems like he's easy going, but when we ordered our food, his demeanor changed. Almost as if he was annoyed at us for whatever reason.  Nothing really stood out to me on their menu, so I decided to play it safe and just go for a personal veggie pizza. I immediately regretted that decision. The dough that they use is really weird and was just off. It wasn't like any pizza dough I've ever had. The pizza sauce is SWEET! What!?? Who does that?! Since when is pizza sauce supposed to be sweet? The veggies that were used are from a can. You read right. From a can. Shocking and disappointing. The pizza didn't taste good at all. I sent it back because there was no way I was going to eat that willingly. The waiter looked shocked that I didn't like it. Sorry bro. The manager comes out and wants to know why I sent it back and if there was something else I would like instead. That was a negative because that "candy" sauce is in everything I'm sure. I thanked him and he took it off our bill. I'm sure this place works for some, but it didn't for me.

I love frozen yogurt.   This place is super close to my place. I'm trying to stay away from this place but it's so difficult to because they carry the basic flavors but for whatever reason they taste so good. The toppings are always fresh and great tasting. Their cookie dough flavor is AMAZING! I've become a fan of their tart one as well. Stop in and enjoy!

As soon as you walk into this place, it feels like you're in a pizza joint in NY. There's tons of pictures of NYC which gives it that authentic feel. The lights that they use are wine bottles handing from the ceiling and they look mighty nice. Now, lets get to the good stuff-the food. Their pizza is really good. The crust is amazing! We got a large pepperoni and mushroom pie. My kids really enjoyed the food and they're pretty picky eaters. Service was really good, I'm not sure what everyone else is talking about, but our waitress was very friendly and fast. I highly recommend this place!

I have heard many positive things about this place so I finally had to go try it. I went with a coworker. I got the three finger combo. It came with three tenders, fries, Texas toast, and a drink. For the price, this is a great deal! The chicken and fries weren't greasy! That's really important. This location is sort of difficult to get to. There's plenty of seating and the girl that helped us was new, but very friendly. If I'm ever in the area again, I will be coming back.

I was moving out of my apartment and needed my carpet cleaned ASAP and done well. It was a cream colored carpet and it looked more like chocolate! I called them up and was very impressed by the level of customer service. When I spoke to Mike, he was very friendly and polite. They did a wonderful job! It looked just as good as when I moved in! I highly recommend them! You won't be sorry!

I have always been a fan of Pita Jungle. Their food has never let me down, especially their hot pitas! My top pick is the Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (Shawarma). You can get the roasted potatoes for an extra .99 cents. They're not bad, but not my favorite.  The staff is very hipsteresque, but extremely friendly. You always get a warm welcome when you come here. They have a lot of art on their walls that's for sale supporting local artists. This place has a great bar with some great beers on draft. Great place for a nice meal!

Not sure what all of these negative comments are about, but it's an ice cream place that normally has kids working. Relax. Lower your standards. They serve ice cream and fast food, they're not drawing up plans for your house. They've never let me down. I'll always be back!

This is my spot! I don't know what the heck the other people are talking about, but this place has always gotten my car clean. I'm not sure what people are expecting here. Car cleaned...checked. Dryer...check. What else do you need?! How difficult is to drive your car into the area...if you can't do that, then I think you have bigger issues than a car wash.

I started doing most of my grocery shopping here. I love the variety of goat cheeses that they carry. The produce is always fresh and they are always well stocked on their fresh herbs.  They don't have any organic ground turkey at this time, so I have needed to go elsewhere for it, but everything else I can get here. The gluten free bread variety is great. I find myself shopping here at least two or three times a week. The customer service that you can expect here is top notch! A+

Wow! Let me say that again...WOW!!!  This place is so good and it's going to be the cause of me gaining a million pounds since it's so close to my house. This was my first time here, I had no clue that this place was here. The owner told me that they've been here for two years!! I've been missing out for two years! This place is located in the Bashas shopping center, it's sort of behind the Taco Bell. So skip that junk and head straight on over to Ezekiel's!!  I had the Fried Chicken Dinner that comes two pieces of chicken, two sides and cornbread. I got their mac and cheese and french friends. I can hear my arteries clogging, but it's worth it!! The chicken breast was huge and it was super juicy. The breading tasted delicious and crispy. The cornbread. Super super moist, sweet and tasty. I really can't tell you how amazing this chicken is, words don't do it justice. You have to come experience this fried goodness for yourself. The mac and cheese will make your toes curl. No joke. I wish I was joking, but I'm not. I'm as serious as a heat attack. They make that delicious cheesy goodness there and it's baked. "whaaaa?!" you say. yup. It's baked there. The fries were really good too. I don't know what sort of fairy dust they sprinkled on them, but they had me at spud.   The owners are so friendly and easy going. They made you feel welcome and knew how to treat a customer.   If you want some real good food, I mean some REALLY good food, your search is over, my friends. I must warn you, your taste buds will never be the same. This is like taking the red pill...there's no going back. Your eyes will be opened to what good soul food is all about.

I order pizza and wings here normally on Mondays. It's just my Monday thing. I really should start cooking more, but you know how it goes. You get home from work, you suffered all day from the Mondays. The last thing you want to do is cook. I always call in our order and just swing by and pick it up. The Barro's Special is really really good. I'd say that's my favorite, but my kids don't like all that extra jazz, so for them, I just order the pepperoni. Do yourself a favor and not cook. Just call them and pick up a pizza. If that's too much, they deliver too!

I have to really give it up to this place, for a chain, their steaks were pretty darn good. I had their New York strip with their baked potato and seasoned rice pilaf. I was pretty happy with the meal. They some pretty tasty bread too, which is unlimited! So bring on the carbs! We didn't have room for dessert, so that will have to happen next time. Our waitress was friendly and quick. She was on top of our drinks and made sure we were never empty. For what this place is, it's not bad at all.

I LOVE MIKA'S GREEK!! This place is located just a hop, skip, and jump away from where I work. This is by far the best place to get a gyro or a pita. My apologies to those other places who sell the same thing, there's a new sheriff in town and they blow you guys out of the water. The customer service is great. There is always a smile of their face, which makes a world of difference. They're really quick, so this works out great when you're pressed for time. I like to just call and order my food, very rarely does this take longer than 15 min. The Chicken Souvlaki Pita is AMAZING!! The chicken is never dry, it's always really tender and moist. I'm super happy they opened up. This place is great for lunch and dinner. You must come here and try it for yourselves!

This place is really neat! Our waiter was super friendly and had a very dashing mustache, added to the charm of the place. When you walk inside, the decor is very simple and nice.  I had the bratwurst which is cooked in four peaks kiltlifter beer (my fave beer!!)  with sauerkraut, onions and bacon topped with swiss cheese and sweet delicious bavarian mustard. I asked for their homemade chips which were super good. They also had Four Peaks beer on tap, which is pretty awesome as they're supporting local breweries. The bathrooms are unisex, which was totally different from what I'm used to, but somehow it worked. There's a nifty little pie spot right next door that I'm going to have to try at my next visit. I will be coming back here for sure.

I'm writing this review with a heavy heart. I'm from around the Bisbee area and have eaten at the original Bisbee Breakfast Club. Their service is NOTHING like the service at this one...theirs is fast and efficient.   The first time I came here, things were good. We were seated quickly because there were no people. Food was really good, but took forever to come. I thought nothing of it and thought that the next time would be better. How wrong I was. The second time let me see how badly this place was run. The restaurant has potential but it's being run to the ground by the manager. At least I think she's the manager. She was the women seating people the two times that I've been there. Has somewhat of a hippy look. She needs to be trained IMMEDIATELY. She's beyond unprofessional and her staff is following suit. The bus boy cleaning tables hated his job. He was so slow doing his job and would throw things around. The waitresses were more interested in conversation with each other than servicing their customers.  We were sitting for a good 10-15 min before someone took our drink order. The "manager" told a waitress to get our drinks. The waitress came over to our table hating life and asked "what do you want to drink?" There was no smile, how are you, I'm sorry for the wait, nothing. I wouldn't believe what I was seeing.   The food is pretty good, it's a shame that the service is driving people away. I hope something is done soon and they either train the manager or get rid of her altogether. The sooner they correct the issue, the sooner people can return and support a local gem.

I have been looking for a place that sells Primal dog food that's closer to my house. I used to have to drive out to Whole Foods for it, but now I can just drive down the street. The customer service offered here is stellar! The guy helping me was super friendly and really knew his stuff. This will now be my number one pet store choice. Come see them for all of your pet needs!

I brought in my two Pugs here and they loved it! They were pampered and walked out of there smelling good and clean. Of course, that didn't last long because those two love to get dirty. Furry Beginnings is a great place to bring your fur baby. The staff is amazing and very caring! You'll love this place!

I am completely pleased with the genius truck. I don't care for the idea of having several different companies come to my house and with the Genius Truck, I am able to get all of my yard services from one place. My neighbor highly recommended them to me and I couldn't be happier. I am one of those people that refuse change, but I'm so glad I listened to her! I requested a quote and they got back to me right away. I'm also very impatient, so them getting back to me so quickly was a huge plus.   When I got their quote, it took me a while to process what the guy had just said. No joke. They were going to be cheaper than my regular pool guy and landscaper. I also found out that they offer pest control and they clean up the little surprises that my pets leave outside.  So after a few minutes of me trying to process all of this, I said "when can you start?" They started me that same week.   The quality of work far exceeded my expectations. They have always gone above and beyond to meet my needs. Did I mention that I can be a bit demanding? They don't mind at all and are always friendly and so knowledgeable. Any issue or question that I might have always gets addressed. I really feel that they care about my business. That's rare nowadays.   It was unfortunate that I had to let the other guys go, but you can't argue with saving money and having higher quality work done to your house. My pool has never looked better and my lawn loves them. I can't stress enough how happy I am with their work. If you're tired of having many different companies coming to your house and want high quality work from knowledge people, call them up. Request your quote and you'll be happy you did!
