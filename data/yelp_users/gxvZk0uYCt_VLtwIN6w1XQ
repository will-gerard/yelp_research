I cannot recommend Joseph and his team enough for potential ring buyers. Between the stunning quality of their rings and the phenomenal service from the employees, I could not have envisioned a better purchasing experience!  It all started when my fiance (spoilers) and I decided to start ring shopping for a setting she would like, she mentioned Joseph Schubach and I decided to reach out to them. Their immediate response was to let me know that not only would they set the stone to the setting I chose, but they could even build it from scratch to allow for customization. The process of getting the right design and to build the perfect ring was incredibly smooth and enjoyable, and the price of the gorgeous ring they were building in house obliterated the market price of the setting at different stores.   Throughout the course of the design and build, I was constantly in the loop about the ring's status, and they beat their expected build time by 3 full days. The ring was flawless and it was easy to tell that my fiance loved it when I proposed because she started crying immediately after I opened the box. It was one of the best moments of my life, made possible by the fact that I had the right ring to give to her!  I have already reached out to Joseph about getting our wedding bands done with them as well, and will continue to recommend them to anyone who is looking to start ring shopping.  Of course, I saved the very best for last. If you are lucky enough to speak and work with Ms. Beth Nicastro, you are in for a treat. In my 5 years of working in the professional world, I have yet to meet someone with Beth's depth of knowledge and passion for her craft. Beth is a consummate professional and will work tirelessly with you to find the perfect ring. In the 20 emails and in store meetings I had with Beth, I never felt pressured or forced to make a decision. Instead, she had a candid discussion with me and made fantastic recommendations.  Thank you to Joseph, and a special thank you to Beth! You two are the best!!

This place was a joke. Lived here for 2 years despite reading that they will absolutely bone you with you deposit. The management couldn't give less of a crap, unless they're towing your car out of the lot. They once got a full sized truck towed in the 5 minutes we took to unload everything and drop it in the new place. It was unreal. I had to get my girlfriend's car out of impound on a work day because they towed it due to her pass expiring OVERNIGHT. As of midnight, the pass expired, so they waited until 12:01 and towed it. I know this because they informed me at the impound the next day while I was questioning why we were there.   When it came time to move out, they not only didn't let us do the walk through with them, they charged us over $800 in damages. This was for everything from ripping out all of the carpeting, despite them saying not to clean it because they were just going to steam it and charge us anyways, to re-finishing the surfaces of the kitchen. The counters are plastic. They will nickel and dime you out of every penny you have, for mid quality apartments in a decent location. Avoid at all costs.  PS, God save you if you try to play music at the pool. I've seen a squad of cops show up and start yelling at people because they were playing music in the pool area....on a Saturday afternoon... in Old Town. That is the level of idiocy you'll be dealing with at San Marin.

Just went in this morning for the first time. My usual haircut is every 8 weeks at super cuts, but my fianc√©e convinced me that I should try these guys out to get a real haircut. Boy, was I happy with the switch.   From the moment I walked in the experience was phenomenal. The owner, Alex, immediately greeted me offered me a water and introduced me to my barber, Boris. No wait, no hassle, just sat right down and got to work  Boris is an expert barber. I have thin hair and a cowlick, making my haircuts more difficult to manage. Boris was able to clean up my look like he'd been cutting my hair for years. Add in the straight razor trim and the hot towel/massager at the end and I left a very satisfied customer. I have already planned my return trip to Who's Next and have sent their number to my friends. I can't recommend these guys highly enough and I look forward to my next visit to the shop.

My girlfriend and I tried this place yesterday based on the "all you can eat sushi" banner and the fairly positive reviews on yelp. We got there around 3 and the staff immediately sat us and walked us through the process. The conveyor belt wasn't on, but that wasn't too surprising given the time of day. The menu is all you can eat from appetizer to dessert and the waitress said try anything you want just don't waste food. We did not think anything of this at first but then we noticed that the top left corner of the second page tells you that if you do not eat all of the food you will be charged accordingly. The food was great, everything was freshly cooked for us. We were able to try several rolls, appetizers, and desserts, and we enjoyed everything we tried. Our bill came out to $30 after taxes including two drinks. Can't beat it. My personal suggestion is to try the miso soup, gyoza, spicy salmon roll, volcano roll, and the deep fried bananas with green tea ice cream (it tasted like Fruity Pebbles!). Overall, a great experience, definitely the first of many for us.

Love this gym. Used to be at a box in chandler and these guys do it better for less cost. Great location and awesome facility. They have me excited to work out again. Would recommend to anyone looking to find an affordable crossfit in Scottsdale or just trying to get involved with xfit. Beginner classes are very friendly and informative. Been crossfitting for a year and and am learning new things here every day. Best gym in the area.
