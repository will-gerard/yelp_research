It's is the place for sushi in Tempe and south Phoenix. It's priced fair and the fish is so fresh. This is the only place I suggest for sushi in this corner of phoenix.

I love breakfast so when I started my new job I was excited to have a breakfast place across the street. Food is pretty good, I've tried a couple things so far and they are good. The staff are nice and attentive.

Amazing place! Took my wife here for her birthday back in May and we sat outside under the misters which turned out to be a very pleasant place to sit. I had been a little worried that it'd be too hot. The staff is very nice and fairly quick to respond, I don't think my water glass was empty for too long. We had a few nicely mixed cocktails and ended up never making it past their amazing appetizers.  I think we ordered most of them on the menu and enjoyed them all.

This is my new favorite Chinese place. The food is good and their prices are very reasonable. I've been slowly making my way through their menu trying different things, all so far have been at least decent most have been good.

I tried their catering menu for a family party a few weeks ago. For the amount of food you get their prices are great! When I picked up the food it was nice and hot and was all ready at the time it was promised.

Good gluten free option for pizza. We discovered this place when we thought I had a gluten allergies. Decent cocktails and a nice atmosphere. Service can be a little slow but I enjoy their pizza so worth it to me.

When the faucet in our shower broke in the on position this morning, yes it was a Sunday morning, I called around and very few companies would answer the phone and the ones that did quoted outrageous prices. I called A+ services based on the reviews here on yelp. Mo was in and out in about an hour and quickly quoted me a fair price. He had the parts on his truck and had the faucet fixed in no time. I will certainly be calling them next time I need help with my plumbing!

One of my favorite bars, the perfect place to drop in for a beer or stay for a couple.  Boulders has a great selection of beers on tap and my favorite part is it seems like they always have something new to try.  The food is very good and if you need a big breakfast before heading out for a weekend adventure stop in for their PBR blueberry pancake.

Lunch is not as busy as dinner and happy hour but I kinda like a mellow lunch time. Food and staff are just as amazing as always. And to top it off they just started a lunch punch card program, buy 5 and get the 6th lunch free.

Fast service and good Thai food. Perfect for a quick lunch away from the office. The staff are quick to refill drinks, my water was never empty. Will certainly be eating here again.

I had a membership at Climbmax for few years and I just wanted to add my warning to any future climbers: This gym is under new management as of last year and any review prior to 2013 doesn't really count. The whole place needs to be cleaned, the floor padding needs to be replaced and routes and holds need to be replaced everywhere. Ropes are frayed and in my opinion dangerous. For a safe climb please go to one of the other gyms in the valley.

Great service, Joe was very helpful in helping me find the right shoe for my foot. He was even training a new employee while he helped me. I was in and out in 30 minutes and this included the gait analysis.

Great beer, good food and a amazing staff. I don't get in here as often as I'd like to but every time i'm in Jon has something new on tap. If you are in south Tempe, this is the place to hangout. Try the fish and chips, it's still my favorite dish they serve.

I used a few other landscaping services before I found CYC. I have to say I've been extremely pleased with their service. There is always one person on their crew that speaks good english and I'm always able to communicate what I need done on the yard. Their crews do a great job, my yard has never looked so good!

My friend and I hit this place hoping for another good bar with great local beers. They do have a lot of beers but unfortunately the bar is too small and poorly laid out. I don't mind standing but there wasn't even any good places to stand here we were always in the way.   Service was pretty horrible, I was handed a beer list and ordered a beer only to be told 5 minutes later that the keg was empty. So I ordered a different beer only to be told another 5 minutes later that that keg was gone. Frustrated I just ordered what my friend had gotten and that beer was finally handed to me about 10 minutes later.   My friend and I finished our beers and decided to bail, it took another 20 minutes to get our bill (for our 2 beers).  Needless to say, there are much better places to go for a good brew.
