ugh.  So while the actually dress buying process was OK- their costumer service post-purchase was HORRIBLE.   I purchased my dress in September and they assured me it would be in by February 1st "at the latest". Come February, I start calling to check on my dress. EVERY TIME I called ( maybe 5 times) the person on the other end said she would call me back after she checked on the status of my dress- THEY NEVER DID.   The dress FINALLY arrived on April 20th- and no they didn't call to notify me- I had to call them.    Now I'm freaking out because I don't have time to get alterations done- Lillian Lottie WILL NOT accommodate rushed alternations.... despite the fact that you have just spent thousands of dollars at their store...  Planning a wedding is difficult enough, don't complicate your life by coming here.

Because of work/ school/ dress ordering complications I only received my dress a few WEEKS before the wedding. Needless to say I was kinda freaking out about getting alterations done in time. Jenny put me completely at ease and completed my alterations in UNDER A WEEK. The dress is perfect and fits me like a dream. She did a great job with all the lace on my dress! In addition, she is very reasonably priced- you will pay less here then at any bridal salon/ department store and her service is unbeatable!
