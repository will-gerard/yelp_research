Our family was looking for another Mexican restaurant last night and couldn't find it when we stumbled upon Manuels. The place was packed, which is usually a good sign. The hostesses seemed a little confused and disoriented, but after we finally got seated, the service was excellent and the food was fabulous. I grew up in New Mexico and Arizona and I think this restaurant has very authentic southwestern flair mexican food. We will go back.

This is our favorite place to eat out when my kids and I are meeting my husband for lunch on his lunch break. I love their shrimp plate with rice and macaroni salad. My daughter loves the same plate, though she foregoes the mac salad for extra rice. My three year old eats off of our plates and gets fresh, hot french fries. My husband likes their pork bbq plate with the rice and mac salad. The help is always friendly and always greet us with a happy, "Aloha." Definitely love this place.

We have had Cox as our main internet and television provider for about 3 years - ever since we moved to the Phoenix area. Recently, we downgraded our internet service because we didn't need the incredibly high speed internet we had first ordered when I was working for a company from home and had to have a certain speed dictated by them. The process to downgrade was great and the technician I spoke with was very clear about the costs and what we would get. He was knowledgeable and helpful. Then, a few days ago (after having had nothing but basic local channels all that time) we got something in the mail inviting us to try DirectTV. We looked into the costs DirecTV and called Cox and found that we would not save anything except installation fees if we went with DirecTV. So, we decided that for the savings in hassle and to not have to put an eyesore of a dish on the house we would just go with Cox and upgrade to a full package of 220+ channels. We even were told by the sales person that hooked us up with new boxes and turned on our additional TV channels that we could save $30 off the installation fee we were originally quoted by having the boxes shipped and installing them ourselves, so that is what we did.  Now we had to get the service activated on the new boxes. We got one set up on Saturday when the boxes arrived (they arrived two days earlier than estimated arrival - YAY!) But, we weren't able to activate the other until Sunday. The lady that I called and spoke to in the Atlanta, GA location on Sunday was DELIGHTFUL! I wish all technical service people took lessons from her in personality and proper service! Even better than the technician I spoke with on Saturday (who was pleasant and helpful, too) she didn't just try to guess which box we were activating, but had me give her the serial number so she could make sure to activate the right one. And while we were waiting for the activation and for the software to do its thing, she initiated pleasant, fun and caring conversation for the 10 minutes or so that we had to be on the phone. She was sweet, kind and knew her job. Way to go Cox! We're super happy customers!

My husband and I found this place by accident last night. We went out to do something else and ended up here. We found their wine to be wonderful, the service was fantastic and we even met some new people we hope to see again. Can't wait to go back!

Never again. My daughter and I wanted to get a fun pedi before we left for a trip to Disney. We decided we would get matching Mickey Mouse heads on our big toes. I picked this place because I saw that they had chairs for kids, but my daughter wasn't even offered a seat in them. The spa pedis were decent and competitively priced for the area, but the paint job was absolutely atrocious. I should have known when they asked what design we wanted and I said Mickey Mouse heads and all we got in response were blank stares from the technicians. They really had no idea what we meant. So, I quickly did a search on my smart phone for an idea to show them. When I showed my technician right as she started my pedicure, she said, "Ah, easy!" So, I sat back and relaxed and figured all would be great. They asked if we wanted our fingers done, too and I declined because we were short on time. Am I glad I didn't pay for a manicure here! My daughter's nail tech said that she would include a paint job for my daughter at no extra charge since I was getting a longer pedicure. After seeing the awful job that was done on her nails, I am so glad that I only paid for a totally messed up pedi, not a messed up mani, too! The paint on her nails was incredibly sloppy. Her toes did turn out okay (not great,) so they were decent enough to go to Disney with, but my toes turned out HORRIBLY. The tech struggled to make a round circle to start off the head! The bottoms of both of the heads on my big toes was squared off! Plus, she was attempting to center the heads and one was way off to the left. Never mind the fact that the ears are proportionally way too small for the size of the rest of the head. It all looked awful! And then, to top all of that off, when she was painting them she accidentally dragged a line of black across the rest of my big toe and instead of fixing it properly, she just tried to just dab it with nail polish remover and then immediately paint over it. So underneath the 'mickey' head immediately began to chip! WORST PAINT JOB EVER! Finally, when I went to pay I was still going to leave a moderate tip, but when I handed the girl cash she acted shocked at the size of my tip and asked if it was for both techs or just one. I will never be back.

We had taken our kids out to see Santa last night and then wanted to take them for a fun treat. My parents were tagging along for the fun. We just did a quick map search for a nearby ice cream shop and this was the closest place. When I told my mom that we were going to Cold Stone, she literally groaned. Cold Stone is not her favorite choice for ice cream. Imagine my surprise, then, when my mom ended up by tipping $2 as she paid for her sweet treat last night! Not only was she excited by the prospect of being able to get a brownie dessert (something we've never gotten at any other Cold Stone and which she really did like,) but we also were all entertained (from age 5 up to age 71) by the singing/flinging servers. Not only did they sing their appreciation for every tip placed in the jar, but they were slinging the ice cream into the cups and putting on quite a show. No wonder the line was nearly out the door when we arrived at this fun little store! It was a great way to end a fun family night out. Kudos to the owner and staff for hiring so well and doing such a great job!!!
