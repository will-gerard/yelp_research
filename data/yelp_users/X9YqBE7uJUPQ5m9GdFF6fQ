I am giving this place 1 star because they only have vanilla soft serve.... Why not chocolate?! I find this very strange and annoying.

It's a shame that this location is run so terribly. I live in the neighborhood and EVERY time myself or my husband go into this location our order is messed up (which is generally a pretty straight forward bagel). On top of that the customer service is awful, the employees are rude and completely unattentive. Can't wait for Lucy's to go in right around the corner at least there on he rare occasion they screw your order up, they are happy to fix their mistake instead of rolling their eyes as if it were your issue to begin with. If you hate humans get out of the customer service industry because it shows!! There are plenty of great restaurants in this area DO NOT waste your time here!!

I do not generally yelp because I feel that you should always experience it for yourself instead of read about it. However, this is an exception to the rule because this place is just that great!!  Yes they are associated with The Mission and Zinc Bistro and those places are great but the house is different. This place could be anywhere L.A., New York, London, San Francisco, and you'de still feel at home. The ambience is romantic, cozy, and chic yet not overdone. The food is amazing! The steak tartare  with house cut fries that dish alone is worth going for but then there's the beef tongue wrapped in a house made scallion crepe... if it hadn't said tongue on the menu I would have never know, it's that delicious! Matt Carter takes risks with food but in a non-confrontational way, which is so refreshing! The guys at the bar...these guys are mixologists! The house "remedies" are top notch. I am usually not a huge fan of gin but the Green lantern is my new favorite drink in Scottsdale! Gin and chartruese with a touch of serrano chile... sounds crazy, tastes crazy good!  This place is small and for being so new it is busy!! You may not be able to sit right away but there is always a cute hostess at the front with a smile and a glass of champagne while you wait.  Once seated we were greeted almost immediately by our server who was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She offered some great suggestions, beef tongue being one of them, and though reluctant at first to try it, we loved it!! We also had the scallops and bone in ribeye which were amazing! At the end she also suggested the house made cinnamon whiskey which was ridiculously good, fireball's got nothin' on this stuff! We will definetely be returning to this unique little spot! Loved it!

There are not many Thai restaurants in the uptown area so when my husband stumbled across this place we figured we would give it a shot. We were pleasantly surprised. The red curry with tofu was delicious with just the right amount of spice as was the pad Thai. The owner, a Thai woman, was incredibly nice and passionate about her business. We are glad they are in the neighborhood and will definitely go back.

This place is the perfect example of what a neighborhood bar should be like! This tiny spot reminds me of the Osterias in Italy, unassuming and to the point! I live in he uptown neighborhood and have a passion for wine so I couldn't wait to check it out. When I first walked in I was a little shocked at how small it was but not in a claustrophobic way. The esthetics were eclectic and DIY which gives the place a lot of character. The owner, and a cute older gentlemen who I assume was his dad (mainly because he kept calling him dad lol) were both very friendly and had some good suggestions on wine. We had a meat and cheese plate, which dad made, and it was delicious as were the wines the owner suggested.  I like the fact that they don't waste paper on reprinting menus and instead write on the chalkboard walls.   When we left my friends and I were very pleased as were our wallets! Needless to say I will be back

Don't let the strip mall location throw you off, this place is great! It has an upbeat modern Japanese vibe and the staff is super friendly. It can be a bit confusing at first for a novice hot pot goer so I would definitely suggest having a server walk you through the the menu/process. After some suggestion from our server, we had the yin yang pot with spicy lemongrass and coconut curry (favorite) broths, organic shabu beef,  shrimp, and a variety of vegetables with udon noodles. Everything was super fresh, the flavors were fantastic and it's a really fun experience overall. Such a great addition to Phoenix and the uptown neighborhood, we will definitely be back!
