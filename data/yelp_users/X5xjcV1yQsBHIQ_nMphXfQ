Recently moving to Chandler, I tried FCAW for an oil change, leather conditioning and car wash.   The person who took "my order" could barely speak English. Not a problem until the free upgrade he gave me on the car wash was non-existent. Still not a problem.   The problem was they neglected to tell me they had 3 people working on cars today and there would be a longer than average wait. After one hour and 35 minutes, and my car still sitting in queue to be finished, I had had enough. When I asked about it, they told me, "Sorry. We are short handed today Three people called in sick."  That's when I decided to finish my car myself. I wiped it down, washed the windows, polished the dash and trim. I got my $50 back for the leather they did not condition.   Then I notice oil leaking so I took it back to the oil bay. They were sorry too; they had forgotten to wipe the residual oil off the car. They said I could bring the car back if it didn't stop leaking.   I will never go back there. I do not recommend it. A two hour wait to get a wash and an oil change is ridiculous. Ruined the flow of my Sunday for sure and had to change plans around. The manager wanted to give me a discount for my next visit, but I told him there wouldn't be a next time.   The guys in the oil change told me they always understaff on Sundays because they are slow. No one called in sick today. So, if you dare to try them, do not go on Sunday.

For a chain grocery,  they do a terrific job giving this Basha's a home-town feel.  I love the employees there--so friendly and helpful. The deli staff is awesome and Jim makes a mean sandwich! I work in Carefree and eat lunch there 3 or 4 times a week--always something good to eat. Their chef cooks a special lunch every day, including a green salad. Add their awesome Chinamist ices tea and it's a hit.   Viva Basha's Carefree!  July 2, 2012 Update!! Basha's has four new deli sandwiches that are AWESOME!! Jim, the sandwich maker extraordinaire, told us they are being timed when they make the sandwiches---under three minutes. And they have several specials that are easy on the wallet, for people like me who eat lunch there nearly every day!  Once again, viva Jim and Basha's in Carefree!

I'm a regular at BMCS. The menu is comfort food--great breakfasts and lunches with all your faves like grilled cheese, patty melts, fish sandwich, great waffle fries and onion rings. Elizabeth, the amazing server, is a treasure and  why I  keep coming back! It's a diner with all the quirks and trimmings. One of the best things about Carefree, for sure. Eat here and get a taste of the local flavor.

Absolutely a storybook wedding!  My daughter had her wedding at The Castle and I have to say, from our initial consultation to the minute she and her new husband drove away in their limo, it was a fabulous experience.   The wedding consultant was very knowledgeable and offered terrific ideas and special touches to create the most beautiful wedding I've ever attended. She coordinated everything with meticulous attention to detail. I know everyone says there's always a glitch at the last minute, but everything went smoothly. From the beautiful flower arrangements to an amazing catering job, we were impressed.     They recommended a great band and we had most of the 250 guests on the floor at some point. It was so fun!  The grounds are beautiful and The Castle offers a rich ambiance that made her wedding seem a little like a fairytale affair.  I will never forget the thoughtfulness of the staff, their impeccable communication and their attention to all the details. They had a can-do attitude throughout the planning process and the wedding itself.  Our wedding consultant was on-site throughout the wedding, just to be sure things went smoothly.  In addition to it being a beautiful, organized venue, it was a value.  I highly recommend The Castle for any couple who wants their wedding to have a little magic in it.

I am lucky to work in Carefree and have this delightful little gem within walking distance of my office. I see ERTR as a destination---it is worth the drive from ANYWHERE in the Valley.. Everything was simply perfect: the ambiance,. our server, the tea and the food was outstanding. A visit to our table by the owner was icing on t he cake. Her name is Jo and she is as delightful as the dining experience.  As a frequent high-tea person, I was tickled to see the addition of a lunch menu that veered from the typical tea sandwich selection. I had what they called "special quiche." Dried tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach and cheddar cheese in a delicious, rich crust---to die for! (Since it's not on the menu and you want to try it, call ahead to see what days they might offer it.) They have other quiches on the menu such a vegetarian and a smoked salmon with cheese and onion. Quiche is served with a mixed greens side salad and your choice of dressing. I had the bleu cheese---it's chunky and fabulous. They had some English comfort food dishes on the menu as well---I will be trying them soon.  My lunch date had tea sandwiches, warm scones with strawberry preserves and Devonshire cream, plus a delicious array of miniature cakes and pastries.She loved it as much as I loved the quiche.  We loved being served on beautiful china, having a lovely table and basically, feeling a bit elegant and special. And here's something that really won my heart. The owner has a trunk of fru-fru hats (what you'd expect from an English proprietor) that offers an array of styles to don the heads of young girls enjoying high tea with their moms and older women enjoying a little playfulness while embracing the magic of an old friendship and the enjoyment of a wonderful meal.    If you'd like to do something fun, grab someone special and head out to Carefree for a memorable day. Dine inside, or on the patio---either way you will say to you lunch partner, "Jackie's review was spot on."  Enjoy this gem. It's a little slice of magic in the middle of the desert. My only question is, :Why did it take me so long to find this oasis?

Love this place. Their quiche is to die for...seriously, if you're a foodie, you will have dreams about this stuff. (I do!) Ok, so this is my second review for ERTR. But I had to write this one because I discovered a little surprise when I finished my lunch yesterday!  I had my tea leaves read by intuitive consultant Janice Roper, who has a cozy alcove in the adjacent ERTR gift shop.   Great lunch, fascinating experience with Janice Roper. (I was able to get a walk-in appointment with Janice---I hear it's a good idea to call for an appointment.) Where else can you have  a fabulous lunch, experience tea-time ambiance, shop and get your tea leaves read? No where but here. Enjoy.

I was excited for my first visit for dinner---I had heard so many great things about Latitude Eight! Guess what---everything I heard was true or even better!! Wonderful, authentic Thai food, very reasonably priced. Charming ambiance---very small venue which makes the owner's (David) presence very personal and authentic. David made our evening so special! Service was perfect; our server anticipated our every need and that was with a party of 12!!   One more thing I have to say. They make a cantaloupe martini that is off the frigging hook. Seriously, I can't wait to go back there.  If you like Thai, make reservations and enjoy a fabulous evening out.  I love it when I get a find like this one!!

Hungry Monk bills itself as a family friendly neighborhood restaurant where great food, sports and craft beer collide. And that's exactly what it is.  It feels like "Cheers" to me...definitely a neighborhood hangout where everyone "knows your name."  Whether I stop by for a beer or to watch a Coyotes game, it's a fun place to hangout. Bring friends...or make new ones. It's that inviting.  For me, I like the fact that the employees are super friendly and truly happy to see me walk through the doors. It's a very welcoming place. Service is warm and sincere---and excellent.   They have an eclectic variety of yummy food. Whether I'm hungry for a salad or a plate of fresh wings to accompany my craft beer, the food is really good. I love a good rice bowl--and theirs is dee-lish! The quesadillas are outstanding. Of course, they have typical bar food, or comfort food as I call it, but the quality and taste surpass what I've had elsewhere. You can get a burger and fries or a gyro with hand-carved meat---and dozens of other delicious options.  Something else that I like about it is that I met the owner on my first visit there. Jim--a nice, down to earth guy who loves sharing his penchant for craft beer! His presence adds to the "friendly neighborhood restaurant" atmosphere.   Bring friends, family or just yourself. Enjoy great food, craft beer (many that you won't find anywhere else) and the camaraderie of others who want to know your name.  I am a big fan!! Tell them Jackie sent you!!

Just because this place is in a strip mall and is technically fast food, doesn't mean it's not the best chicken teriyaki bowl in town!   I have only tried the chicken teriyaki bowl and each time, it's the best I've ever had. Wonderful sauce---not too sweet and superbly grilled chicken.  Every time I come out this way, I make place to stop in for lunch or dinner.  Best $7.50 you'll ever spend on a bowl and drink.  Nice staff too.  Someday, I will try their sushi.

Yuck.  I thought I had found a delectable dive in the midst of metropolis. Nope. I ordered the something "Monte" they said was their most favored breakfast. I couldn't eat it--tasted like old grease.  It wasn't just me. My friend had an omelet. Meh.  For those of you seeking a new, off the beaten path "find" for breakfast, this is not the place.

This man cured my chronic pain and insomnia.  I met Bob last summer when he hired me to do some web design work.  That's when I learned about hypnosis. I thought it was interesting that hypnosis is probably the only profession that can be used as entertainment and as therapy. Pretty amazing how that works--audiences are "curious" about what hypnosis really is and if it's legitimate--unlike a magic stage show where illusion is the story. Both stage hypnosis and one-on-one hypnotherapy work on the same premise--tapping into the subconscious mind. It's real--no illusions.  Watching Bob perform on stage as well as one-on-one, I became a believer. I wanted to share my experience with Bob with you. Hypnotherapy has changed my life--my quality of life is better today than it's been in a decade.  I first approached Bob for some help relaxing and to sleep better. One session and I was able to relax, turn off my brain and get a good night's sleep. After years of trying medication prescribed by my doctor, without any luck, I was amazed at how one session with Bob changed my life. When I think of the time and money I spent going to my doctor, I wish I had known about hypnosis a long time ago! And no drugs!  I was visiting with Bob last week and told him I was going to a chiropractor to see if he could help me with chronic neck pain that I've had for over five years. (And, yes, I've thrown a lot of time and money at this too. MRIs, neurologists, surgeons, pain medication--I've tried everything.) Bob suggested we do hypnosis for the pain. Before he performed the therapy, he cautioned me that the pain would go away, but I still needed to pursue the underlying problem. He felt that hypnosis, coupled with chiropractic care, would be a healthy approach to not only correcting the problem, but having a better quality of life.  Ten minutes of hypnotherapy and my neck pain was gone. Gone! I was incredulous! Wow. Much of my sleeping problem was due to the neck pain. I had this hypnosis four days ago and am still pain free. I had my initial visit with the chiropractor and he was so impressed that I had the presence of mind to use hypnosis AND chiropractic. He said not many of his patients use hypnosis because they don't know/understand enough about it. He did say that our mind is the most important tool to help us heal.  I can't say enough about hypnosis and Bob. My take is, if you're not making progress with an illness, sleeping and relaxation issues, self-esteem, focusing or whatever is holding you back from living the life you deserve, hypnosis is a wonderful alternative therapy. You'll know in one session whether hypnosis is for you. I recommend Bob without reservation.  If you have any issues that have been holding you back, see Bob. Students and athletes use hypnosis to learn to focus. There are many applications for hypnosis--think about it. It may change your life as it has mine.

It always tickles me to find a little slice of heaven in my own back yard. Barrelhouse is it.  Hidden in a strip mall, once you're inside, the hip, almost industrial vibe sets the mood for a laid back evening of eclectic cuisine, drinks so delish you'd think they had a chemist behind the bar and a respite from from a formulaic chain or an over priced indy restaurant .  I've been there twice. First time, service was a little shaky, but they communicated with us abut the situation and we had an amazing dinner. Plenty of time to talk and catch up with friends, while enjoying cocktails and appetizers prior to the  entrees. I knew they were having an off night---they were more upset about it than we were. Food was amazing.  Last night, we gave them another shot. Service--- five stars. Amazing. Food is nothing less than marvelous. I had Caribbean Jerk  Spiced Sea Bass and it's the best I have ever had. My best friend had pot roast---simmered for 8 hours and while I would never order pot roast at a restaurant, I would order this!! (Your grandmother has nothing on pot roast compared to this.)   I could go on and on about the menu, but check it out for yourself. It's unlike any menu I've seen----from grass fed beef hamburgers to truffle mac n cheese.   You can make reservations too.     Enjoy a little find in the east valley!

Naming the place Taco Haus prepared my palette for a taco experience. Especially since it replaced Blue Burrito.  But that's not what I had. It's almost like the chef wants to be a clever alchemist but fails. Tom Jetland he is not.  I had two tacos. One chicken. One carne asade. The chicken one had no flavor except I could taste the corn tortilla.. The steak one tasted like the steak had been marinated in Worcestershire sauce, which was unpleasant. I dressed them both up with guacamole and salsa (I had to ask for and they were extra). I hated the lunch.  The place looks like it would be a great happy hour--inside has picnic table style seating, built to be lined up with butts from the frat house on Saturday night. There's a lot of seating outside too, which would be a fun happy hour.  Service was slow, although there seemed to be a lot of servers. My friend and I paid $30 for our lunch, left and went to McDonalds to get ice cream cones to cleanse our palettes from a lunch we are trying to forget. He had ceviche, by the way, and was more than underwhelmed.  I am happy to read that some of these reviews of Taco Haus are so glowing. Maybe I caught them on an off day but somehow, I don't think so. I am a total foodie and this is one place I would not recommend.  But what I will recommend to Taco Haus:  write a little blurb about your style and philosophy on the menus so customers understand they're not getting a taco that their palette might be craving.  I'll give them two stars because it appears they have a wide selection of tequilas. After enough tequila, anything tastes good, right?
