Customer service here as in the whole of Royal Palms is nearly through the roof great, at times even bordering on obsequious. Service was not quite excellent, but it's really great. Had dinner here and ordered tasting menu ($40) and accompanying libations ($20). The tenderloin was pretty much the best tenderloin I've ever eaten. The beet salad was delicious and the cheesecake was thick and creamy. My bf had the antelope (!!) which he thought was great, cooked to perfection, tender and tasty.The accompanying drinks were interesting and fun, but I'm not a big drinker so I reached my limit pretty early.   I don't know about y'all who are complaining about portion sizes, portions are normal-sized and VERY filling. If you're used to strapping on the feedbag at a buffet, then you may be disappointed, but the bf was happily full and I left STUFFED and quite happy.   I highly recommend!

Loved my visit here. I think it was my second or third time. Loved whoever curates the shows because I enjoyed everything! They had just torn down their Hollywood exhibit and that's find with me because I'm from LA.   I recommend that you go into the Yoyoi Kusuma room/exhibit. I LOVE that room! Kusuma loves dots and paints dots and makes dot art. She was a contemporary of Warhol and has lived at the Seiwa Hospital for the Mentally Ill in Japan since 1973. Crazy, huh? Seriously, she must have an art studio at the mental hospital because she's still making some serious art. A can't miss!

A) this place is open on Sundays which apparently a lot of good lunch spots in Phoenix are not and B) this is one of the best BBQ joints I've ever been to!   The BBQ brisket was tender and moist, my bf is from the south and was very impressed with the authentic Carolina BBQ sauce. The service was really above and beyond, at least 3 different staff members came to check up on us and everyone was SO friendly. (A certain resort in Sedona could learn from the people here!).   The strawberry lemonade was super sweet and after you've stuffed yourself on delicious, moist BBQ, they give you 4 donuts in a bag with your check. Great idea because a bag of beignets certainly makes paying easier, though the food and service were so good, paying would never be a burden here.   If you like BBQ, you MUST come here! We'll be back for sure!

Okay, this Mastro's is meh, 2 stars. Sis and I have eaten as Mastro's Beverly Hills for decades and I thought this was a safe choice for Xmas eve. It was predictably crowded, we were seated promptly, but we waited almost too long for our food. Then when my sister's monstrous rib eye came out, she found it overcooked. So much for medium rare having a warm center, this steak was medium, which sis hates. The waiter apologized and took it back to bring out another. My bf's filet was more medium than the medium rare he ordered, but he is loathe to complain and ate it anyway. The broccoli was a tad past al dente and the snap peas were cooked to a mushy consistency. Yikes. When sis asked for boxes for the left overs (some were for the dog) the busboy balked at putting things in separate boxes. WTF? I realize this is not Beverly Hills, however the prices are the same, but the quality is definitely not there. If you're used to good steakhouses like Fleming's where they know how to cook a steak correctly, then you'll be disappointed in Mastro's City Hall, I know I was.

I had the scallops which were delicious. The creamy polenta was really good and the bacon popcorn was dangerously good! My bf had the tenderloin which he thought was great and I also had the Thai Margarita which had a spicy salted rim and was surprisingly delish. Service was very attentive and not at all pushy. For a mid-range dinner spot, it's as good as it gets! Entrees about $20-35.   The hostess was friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend!

Gotta love the Palomar! Came here with family over Xmas and though the staff was pared down to bare bones, we had a very relaxing time. We upgraded to a corner suite (well worth the money), watched the ice skaters on the temporary rink right outside, Golds' Gym is so close you can practically crawl there and then there's the uber friendly service. From the free cocktail hour to the free loaner bikes to the dog friendly vibe, we very much enjoyed our stay. I was worried that not being on the top floor might be noisy (I'm a light sleeper), but I didn't hear anyone and the bed was so comfy! A welcoming and warm place to visit! And winter rates were quite affordable.

For a butcher shop/Mexican restaurant, this is as good as it gets! Went here for lunch thanks to Yelp reviews. Had the stuffed poblano chili which was HUGE and creamy and delicious. The bf had a torta which he really liked. Our waitress was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about which items were gluten free and which weren't, what more could anyone ask for? If you like Mexican, stop here!

The staff here is so friendly and helpful. Unlike some upscale stores where they look at you, deem you unworthy and ignore  you, at Prada they wait on the sidelines with smiles and a helpful attitude.   And the quality of Prada bags goes without question. Though I didn't buy anything this time, I still love this store.
