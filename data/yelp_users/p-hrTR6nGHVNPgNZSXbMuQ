I have been to practically every spa and salon in the valley searching for a great nail salon.  My friend worked at the Village as a camp counselor and he suggested I check their salon out.  I was sadly disappointed.  When I originally called to make an appointment the receptionist was rather rushed and sounded inconvenienced by my call.  I am an understanding person so I didn't really think much of it.  My friend and I went in on the day of our appointment and were still asked to wait for about 20 minutes because the nail tech hadn't come back.  Again, I am not really impatient or unreasonable so it didn't really bothered me.  The thing that pushed me over the edge was the nail tech.  My friend was getting a pricier manicure and the tech was very personable and friendly to her.  Because I had gotten my nails done only a week earlier I asked for an express manicure instead.  She rushed through and was extremely rude to me.  I definitely walked out with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole experience and was not happy when I still was paying a relatively high price for my manicure.  Maybe I caught everyone on a bad day but I would suggest looking somewhere else unless you absolutely have to get your nails done um, at a health club?

Postino is one of my FAVORITE restaurants I have ever been to.  I always make sure to be very hungry when I go.  I can't say enough good things about it so I will try to be as concise as possible.  My friends and I usually go on Friday and Saturday nights and it is understandably busy.  We all usually grab a delicious glass of wine and don't mind the short wait at all.  I cannot say enough nice things about the staff here.  They are always very polite, friendly, and conscious of getting us seated as soon as possible.  We always order one or two planks of bruschetta to start out.  I have had them all and love them equally.  To follow that I usually order the prosciutto and brie panini.  All the ingredients taste so fresh and the bread is equally delicious (I have to admit I am picky about bread, coming from San Francisco sourdough land) I have to admit that all the food and wine fill me up so I have never tried their desserts but I am sure they are amazing as well.  The food is amazing.  The service could not be better.  The ambiance is nice and casual. The price is more than reasonable.  I have no criticisms for this restaurant and encourage everyone to go!

Food 5 The reviews are true, this place is an institution. I've tried it all, enchiladas, machaca, tortillas, tacos, tostadas, burritos. By far my favorite Mexican food in either California or Arizona. Fiancee swears by the chicken chimichanga with guacamole and sour cream. My favorite is the chorizo plate with tortilla on the side and rice and beans.  Atmosphere/Service 5 Yes, it's shady. But it's fast, always packed with people in suits, cops, and average joes, and extremely comfortable/casual. This place is a must visit in my opinion.

My favorite Starbucks in the valley. The actual location is nice and big. The staff learned my name and order quickly and they always manage to work through the line in a timely manner (the way to this girl's heart at 7am on a weekday morning).

Food 5 Food used to be good here, since the menu changes, I would say it's even better! Be sure to try the beer battered french fries or anything from their weekend brunch menu.  Drinks 4 As microbreweries go, I think some are great, some are mediocre. Be sure to try the Raj IPA or Pumpkin Porter when it's in season.  Atmosphere/Service 4 There seems to be a lot of staff turnover here. We go frequently and never seem to see the same servers. Nice large area and relatively quick to seat you. Good place to go for watching Sunday football games or away ASU football games.

Best four years of my life.  I graduated with my bachelor of science in marketing and my bachelor of science in management.  I also got my international business certificate, all through the WP Carey School of Business at ASU.    Thanks to many generous scholarships and many different class schedule options I not only graduated in four years but also graduated with honors and graduated from the Barrett Honors College after completing my senior thesis.   I love the professors, the campus, the weather, the convenient location.  Honestly you will be hard up to find someone more enthusiastic about ASU :)  There are so many different opportunities and choices, the sky is the limit.  I was extremely involved with extra-curricular activities offered through the university, I never was bored.  Thank you Arizona State for a wonderful college experience.  I can't wait to come back for my MBA!

I felt the need to write this review because 1. I miss Tempe more than I can explain and 2. Thuy is one of my most favorite nail techs I have ever had. EVER.  I moved to Tempe when I went to college and I was looking for a cheap, convenient, quality nail salon.  Before I moved to the East Coast I continued to return there about once every other week because I couldn't find another place I liked as much.  Okay, let's get one thing straight right off the bat.  If you are looking for a fancy, over the top, bells and whistles experience, I would suggest looking around a little more.  This nail salon is exactly what it is.  Reasonably priced.  Fast.  Close.  I have never been a complete stickler for sanitation practices only because I find that even the high priced salons have questionable or lacking sanitation procedures.  If you are afraid of getting any kind of infection just don't go to a salon to get your nails done.  It really is as simple as that.  With all that lame lecturing done, I have never had a bad experience at Uni.  I used to go to a place in N Phx on special occasions and that would usually run about $175 for a mani/pedi plus tip.  Honestly, the work wasn't that much better either.  I have been to Uni so many times I have had work done by almost all the techs and while they all do a good job, I especially liked Thuy.  She does an amazing job and is really personable.  As everyone has said before there is never really a wait but for the past couple of years I would call in to ensure I could get an appointment with her.  If you want a fast, quality, inexpensive mani/pedi.  Look no further.

I'll make this short and sweet. I hate taking my car in for service almost as much as I hate going into the dentist. I am always concerned about being taken advantage of and not getting quality service. Hon-Man in Tempe is the complete opposite. They are quick to make time to see my car. I especially like that they tell me which services I can wait to complete and what should be done immediately. Great shop with great people and I definitely recommend.

I am a self-admitted cupcake fiend.  I love baking them, eating them, looking at them, watching tv shows about them...needless to say I don't take cupcakes lightly.  I have to be honest I have not been very impressed with CCs in my multiple visits.  Coming from Tempe, I usually stop at Sprinkles because it reminds me of back home and I can always rely on a consistently good product.  Sometimes when I want a different flavor cupcake I venture up to Hilton Village to get something from CCs.  I really do enjoy the menu that they have and it offers a lot of options when ordering.  I don't mind the frosting either, I like a lot with my cupcakes.  What really turns me off is the service.  I have been to CCs about a dozen times and I am always treated like I'm some kind of inconvenience.  I am very understanding when it comes to a couple bad experiences because I understand not everyone has a good day every day.  But really, after my last trip I decided that I don't need to be treated badly, especially after paying so much.  My advice to consumers, go to Sprinkles right next to fashion square.  The quality is just as good, prices comparable, and the service is much better.  My advice to the owners, be grateful that you are doing something that you love and are passionate about and be thankful for the customers you do have by treating them well.

I went to Sack's as an ASU student and I continue to go to Sacks as an ASU employee. The sandwiches are always made super fresh and the prices very affordable. My go-to used to be the Symphony (which is delicious) but I have now switched to the Dali. Normally I am extra wary of egg salad prepared at different restaurants but this sandwich is delicious! That plus the free cookie? Yes please!

It's interesting to read through all the reviews and find myself mirroring a lot of the other comments.  Pros: It's so adorable to look at, the decor is amazing and everything seems very clean. They are relatively accommodating in terms of scheduling appointments. They discard the files after one use.  Cons: The quality on 2 of my 3 trips was so bad.  I get better mani/pedis at my hole in the wall $30 place. So expensive!  My techs were always complaining about something.  I have to admit, I haven't been here for about a year but I find myself wanting to go back when I visit AZ to give it ONE. MORE. CHANCE.  One of my friends blogs about Phoenix spas and salons and she suggested I try Sundrops out.  Aesthetically it cannot be beaten.  I fell in love with it the second I stepped in.  After that my love affair faded.  The first nail tech I had on my first trip was amazing but I haven't seen him there since.  I was a little taken aback when I had to pay such a high price in the end, but it was worth it and it was a nice infrequent treat I would allow myself.  The next 2 times I went, however, I hated my techs and my french manicures looked like I had done them myself.  I want to like this place so badly and I think that is why I keep returning to try it over and over.  I think, however, I may just have to give up and try somewhere else.

Being a foodie transplant from California I obviously gravitated toward the FOX Restaurant Concepts group of restaurants.  I love the modern decor, innovative menus, and overall aesthetic qualities of their restaurants.  I unfortunately have to say that of the FOX Restaurants, Blanco is one of my least favorites.  I have to admit that their margaritas are amazing but I have been three times now and have always been disappointed in their salads and entrees.  I may be a little picky and love good Mexican food but I find that my food tends to be bland and definitely leaves something to be desired.  My friends and I now only go to Blanco for drinks after work and then decide on a different location for dinner.  If this is your plan then I definitely recommend heading over for some of the best margaritas in the valley.

We recently purchased a brand new home and got about half the windows covered with blinds by the builder before moving in. We quickly realized we should have probably gotten all of our windows covered so I called up our builder to see if we could get the remaining windows done. They were going to charge us about 4 times as much as when they originally installed so I figured I could find someone to do a pretty close match for a fraction of the cost.  We received an ad in our mailbox for Superior Blinds so I thought I may as well get a free estimate to see how much it would cost and how closely they could match our existing blinds. Deborah at the office was very nice and professional and quickly contacted me to set up my estimate appointment. Oscar was also very nice and professional and said they could match the exact same brand/color.   They ordered the blinds and set up my installation appointment conveniently on Veteran's Day. The installer was there for only 20 min and the new blinds look great. Not only was the customer service great, but they ordered and installed my new blinds for even less than I had originally paid through my builder. Such a great experience.

I love all the Postino locations, but Postino East may be my favorite. Conveniently located in Downtown Gilbert, this Postino never disappoints with delicious bruschetta, amazing sandwiches, and great happy hour deals. Not to mention the staff and service is phenomenal. Postino is a must-go for locals and out of towners alike.

Food 2.5 Food was okay. Typical/standard breakfast fare. Line moved relatively quickly despite a lot of people but the kitchen was struggling to keep up. Came in relatively early in the morning and already had ran out of many of the food items.  Atmosphere/Service 2.5 Took forever to get a table and staff didn't seem to be in a hurry to clear off tables. Cute decor but just not a great space and ended up with a lot of waiting.

Food 5 I've been to the downtown Phoenix, Gilbert, and now Tempe locations and the food is always great and consistent. Great appetizers, sandwiches, and brunch items. Get a board of bruschetta.  Drinks 5 Great unique wine selection and awesome $5/glass happy hour deal.   Atmosphere/Service 5 Even though there always seems to be a lot of people the staff is always pleasant and quick to seat you. Nice, trendy interior.

Food 5 Bay Area/DC transplants with high expectations. Went here based on other Yelp suggestions and it completely lived up to expectations and more. Recommend the Pad See Ew and Pineapple Fried Rice.  Atmosphere/Service 5 Placed an order to go and was told to return in about 20 minutes to pick up order. Drove back home with order only to realize 2 orders of spring rolls were missing from the bag. Luckily we live close by, we went back and they quickly realized the mistake, made two fresh orders and gave us complimentary thai iced teas. Excellent service and location.
