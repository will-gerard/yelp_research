Thus place is going down hill. The taco Tuesday prices went up from .99 to 1.69 and the out less chicken in the tacos. On top of that, the chicken didn't taste so good. The only thing that is still the same is the front staff taking the order but what good is that if the food isn't anymore.

I give this 5 stars cause it is what it is. A gay sports bar. Great to go on game days. Tuesdays are their busiest nights with 2 for 1. They also have some sundays that are busy becuase of the games. Drink prices are reasonable. They have 3 dart boards and 2 pool tables. Side note: They do not take credit cards on tuesdays. Bring cash or there is an ATM on site.

I am gonna give this place 5 stars because it is what its supposed to be. They also have cheap drinks and they pour them pretty dang good. The staff is very friendly. This is the kind of place everyone ends up at on Friday and Saturday nights. Its a country bar and they play country music, but at about 1pm they place top 40 music.  This place is busy on Thursdays (2 for 1), Fridays, Saturdays and definitely the place to be Sunday during the day and at night.  This is by far the busiest gay bar in phoenix and when can get pretty packed when there is a special holiday or event. Even for the size it is. This place gets super packed for Halloween and the gay rodeo. Definitely a place to check out.

Great place. Upscale gay bar. I usually have fun here. THe only reason I give it a 4 star is because of the prices. I guess I am paying for the atmosphere? Anyway, same drink here that would cost me $7, I can get at another gay bar for $4. Other than that, definetly a great time and sometimes that $7 is very much worth it.

This is a great place. Its amazing the prices for what you get. So many times I go to other restaurants to eat breakfast and I end up paying $20 bucks on average. I spend less than half here. Food is good, staff is friendly. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is becuase I like to have some nice drink specials on my sunday, such as mimosas and bloody marys and this place doesnt have that.

The food was great. Service great. Cute place. The pad thai was amazing. The yellow curry was ok. We asked for hot but it didnt taste that spicy. The shrimp in the pad thai wasnt very good.but the chicken in it was great. Overall it was a great experience.

Great prices. Barry will fit you to the T. When you come in he will ask you question on what you are looking for and wont just try to sell you any suit. Check it out. You wont be dissapointed.

When you drive up to it ur unsure what to think. Dont let it scare you. The food is amazing. I loved the carne adovada. You can get it in red or green sauce. I got half and half. The chorizo stuffed chicken was also amazing. Went on a sunday. They have 10 dollar specials. A must go!!!

Any of you from LA? Know the Motherload? Well this place gives you strong drinks too!!! and they will serve them in a tall glass if you ask. They make the best stiff drinks in town. I like this place cause its just a fun place to go. I think the 5 stars goes for the drinks mostly. hehe.

I loved the place. The atmosphere was great. The staff is friendly. The pizza was great. It can get a little pricey when you order your own pizza and start adding things to it but its well worth it. I can also say that I ordered a drink at the bar and it was a nice drink. Alot of times I go to restaurants and I hate to order drinks as they are expensive with little alcohol.

One of my favorite gay bars in phoenix. They have a great dance floor, nice restrooms and a nice patio. I have to say the most impressive thing about this place is the staff. Stacey has made an amazing bar out of this place and it seems like the staff are all happy working there. A top gay bar choice for sure!

Quick and friendly. I like the drive up and park service where they will bring you out your coffee. Egg and ham sand which was good. I like how clean the place looks. This is definitely the perfect place to swing by before work, especially for those of you who are heading south on 7th street to downtown. You would be in and out in a flash. I'll have to be back to try their yogurt.

Two stars for the food and some of their staff service. Minus 3 for crappy bottomless mimosas that had zero fizz to them. More like bottomless orange juice....

Matt did an amazing job on transforming this place. The first thing I said when I walked in is "it doesnt smell like Urine".  This place looks on point. Has an amazing patio, a jukebox which you can control from your phone and the staff is always friendly. This is now one of my favorite gay bars to go to. I cant wait till they start serving food because I want to check it out!
