I had eaten here years ago. My family went again tonight because we had a Groupon. It was actually a great time. The waitress was VERY good- sorry I don't know her name. Shee was on my families refills.      The food was good- My husband had a calzone- He loved it. We had mozz sticks, maybe the best ones I've ever had. We had a 20 pc mild chicken wings. They were so far- my favorite milds. I'm picky because I can't take really hot stuff and these wings were tasty and good. Great size chicken too. We had a pizza and it was ok. Not the best, Not even close to the worst. Nothing bad to say. I will go back for the wings:)

After years of coming here, either today was an off day or things have changed. I always order the same thing- pollo con queso.. Today was inedible, I sent it back and didn't dare try anything else ( That's just me) The chicken was heavily seasoned and I got a lot of Grissel.  Even the rice tasted blah.....Arriba's what happened??

My husband took me to Chris Ruth for our anniversary . It was the first time  i'd ever been there. He did make a resv and told them it was our anniversary , they had rose petals on the table. Nice touch. We aren't drinkers so we only had bottled water ( 2 large) and lemonade. My hubby had stuffed chicken breast, mashed pot and a tomato soup as a starter. I had a steak with aug potatoes. We also had shrimp cocktail.Biggest shrimp I've ever seen :)    ( 1 to share). We had a little dessert to share, the plate said Happy anniversary  in chocolate, nice touch. With tip our bill was $208.  The food tasted great. It was fun to go once and have that romantic dinner. But Texas roashouse steak tastes better, just saying...LOL We could have ate there 4 times for steak dinners for $208. But it still would NEVER had been as special as eating at Ruth Chris. Would we go again, knowing what it cost? Maybe for our next anniversary .   Ps, $32 of our bill was the water and lemonade- so if you want the experience but need to cut cost- there you go:)

Liked it better than Phoenix swap mart- Maybe it was just because it was new to me:) I grew up in Mesa- Have lived in Phx for years- Was reminded of the snow bird situation, lol. Tons were there. My husband wore his Sooners Jersey so he got to talk to locals about it :)    The whole place is covered- crowded- but we liked it.

I have no idea why I've forgotton Karl's bakery. I get in patch where I shop grocery store backeries- I like Bashas. BUT Karl's is so good!    I've been watching the New York Cronut  phenomenon and wondering WHEN I would finally get to try one. Then thank the Heavens Karl came up with his Kronuts. they had three different kind this morning. The sugared one had lemon flavor and the other two may have been bavarian cream, not sure. All three were tasty. My only suggestion- one with NO filling and a glaze on top or whatever. I loved them!     Karl was handing out samples and everyone there was in agreat mood. Love this Bakery- Not close to me, but worth the drive. Thanks

I love Brass Armadillo! I went into here one day after church and have been going back ever since.   This is a huge place, you can spend hours here. They even have a little cafe which is perfect. Because if you are really looking at everything, YOU will need a little break. If you go plan a few hours.

***Genie G's Does NOT accept ENTERTAINMENT BOOK coupons***  We tried out Genie G's because we had a coupon out of our entertainment book. After we ate and went to pay we found out they do not accept the coupon. Just beware.  I Had the Steak and eggs my husband had the Hungry Man's Breakfast. Everything was good. The waitress was Awesome. Great service, good food- even without a coupon, we'd go back.

My good friend treate dme to Tea at Kimberly Ann's. We had a great time. I believe you have to have a reservation- is that such a problem??? No.  Help a small biz out. I'm not positive but it seems like a family run place. The tea is good, the place is cute! The small sandwiches and finger foods were delish, as was the soup. I want to take my mom here next:)

Finally tried the New AMC theater. I am a loyal Harkins T-shirt wearing ,cup toting  Movie goer. But the old man and I decided it was time.   1- Most comfortable theater we have ever been in! We were in the Cinema Suites side. It was first class the whole way. Seats lay almost flat.  2- You can order food/ drinks- adult beverages- The whole Cinema Suites area is 21 and over- no kiddies... 3. Food was really really good. We had burgers and fries- Delish. I also had a waffle, maple, bacon ice cream dessert- Best dessert I've had in a while. If you order soda- free refills. I ordered bottled water. Later noticed others just getting tap water- I will order that next time. 4. Even though I gave it a 5 star I have to mention. There are lights that stay on during the movie and the wait staff are walking by a lot. I was ok with that- but that may drive others crazy. 5. Not for the poor- We paid $33.12 for 2 tickets- and $68.63 plus $12.00 tip for dinner. 2 burgers and fries, 2 drinks, 2 desserts and $12.00 for the rewards stubs card.  6. Until we hit the lottery- we will reserve going to this theater for very special occasions or for movies that are 2 1/2 hours or longer.

Not for me. I love cupcakes- I like heavy sugary delish cupcakes and these were not. If you like lighter- If your a person that eats sweets and says, eww thats just to sugary. Than you will probably love the cupcakes. I tried 2 kinds...vanilla and coconut. Sadly they weren't for me. I still think Gigi's is the best I've had so far.  also, I'm tired of seeing tip jars EVERYWHERE! The guy behind the counter boxed up 6 cupcakes- wasn't all that friendly to me ( was to the teenagers girls ahead of me) and he moved on to the next customer before I even signed my receipt......Where would a tip play into that????

I bought 6 cupcakes and1 Salted Caramel nut bar The cupcakes I reviewed on olliecakes. This review is for the Nut bar.  The buttery shortbread hardly made it out of the bag. It was falling away from the caramel and pecans before I could get to it. Thats annoying. the taste of the caramel pecans was ok to goodish. But having it almost detatch from the shortbread is a no no. It was crumbs EVERYwhere... To bad it it had stuck together I may have given it 2 or 3 stars.   also, I'm tired of seeing tip jars EVERYWHERE!

My husband and I attended a dinner show last night. We had such a fun time!!! The people at we met were great. The show it self was fun and we laughed all night. Totally worth the $. It was sort of an interactive murder mystery show. I wasn't sure if my husband would like it, but he loved it and we plan to attend one of their other show........Go to one....It was really fun:)  $39 that included the chicken dinner, salad and cake. Coffee and water at the tables. Drinks $2 and I think their was drink specials for $6.......There is a bar right in the room.

Never was able to find out if they were any good. I called to make a Saturday appointment- They don't take New patients on Sat. I only wanted Sat so I don't have to take off work. So I'll set up with a different Dentist.                                                             Arrivederci Davinci!

My husband and I like to try new restaurants via whatever comes up thru Groupon. We've tried some ok and some forgettable places. But OMG Steve's Grillhouse was a total surprise. We LOVED it. Will go back again with no groupon/coupons-yes they were that good. I got the blacked pork chops. They came with House potatoes, mixed veggies and a roll. 2 pork chops. My husband got the green chili burger. I had never had blacked pork chops- They were the reason for the 5 starts. Total FLAVOR!! I'm so tired of flavorless food or food that I have to cover up with condiments. The wait staff were very nice and they refilled drinks before they were empty ( I think that's a plus in the AZ heat) Oh yeah- sports were on the tvs if your in to that...my husband was.

I like costco but hate the crowds ( not even holiday crowds) but this costco draws so much trashy people in the cafe area. Anyone can eat there- even non memebers. The should have a line just for members. lately I have see alot of people filling up soda with a non costco cup- kinda annoying........ Same great kirkland products at this location and closest to my house.

How do I know? I used hardly any tarter and I ALWAYS use a ton of tarter. They were just so delish!  Two friendly guys working there. Next time- 3pc cod:) and I want to try the macNcheese.

We never board our dog, but were forced to for 4 nights. We decided a stress free cage free option might work for her. I love that Villa La Paws has webcams so we could see what Mrs Beasley was doing all day. They seem to move the dogs in and outside all day, we liked that. Staff was friendly. We opted for a bath on the day we picked her up. Nice place

2 out of 5- mainly because price vs. selection.  The buffet at Talking stick is about $5 more and I give that a 5 star.   Eagles buffet had a very small selection and desserts were cheap.  On a sat night and for $46 for 2 people. We were dissappointed.  Good food and service.  Service people were awesome and place was clean and nicely appointed. Could do with a little more variety for food. My husband filled up on mashed potatoes and macaroni salad.

My husband and I went tonight to teakwoods for the first time. We had a groupon. The place was packed.  Different football games going on tvs all over the place. I didn't mind, but my hubby was in heaven:)   Hostess told us every table was full except outside. So went outside, turned right around because I forgot about smokers, lol.     We waited about 1 min and the hostess asked us if we would mind sharing a table with another couple. We said sure.  There was 6 chairs  and 4 of us total so 2 empties inbetween us. It was same as if we had our own table. Worked out great:)   We started off with the jess Jess boneless wings- Delish!!!!! Not wet like other wings in fact I think they coat them and then throw them on the grill. We Loved them! I ordered a southern thang burger - my  hubby got a Teaks touch ém all. They were huge!  We each ended up taking half home.  Not just huge but tasty. I loved mine.    We decided to pay and use the groupon another time to ensure we would remember to come back:)  Great place- waitress nice and friendly, good food- we will eat there again!

Looked fresh and I think it was 1/2 pound. The burger and fries was a great deal! We also shared the brownie dessert. Everything was tasty and the waitress- Kara? was on my Ice Tea refills.

This was our second time eating at Zipps. We received a gift card. The first time was ok/good. Last night- we experienced a Meh moment. We ordered burgers. When they came out- I ate a fry. Took the Bun off the burger- looked at my husband and said. "I didn't order this." But it was the burger with bbq and onion rings on it. It actually was my second choice so I decided to keep it.     My husband noticed they brought him half/half fries and onion rings. He didn't order that but -whatever.    server comes back- says sorry these weren't yours, we mixed them up. I start to say- I touched the burger-she was gone. It's very loud in Zipps- BUT When a customer is speaking to you- don't rip the food away and go. My husband said, well, you tried to tell her.     My point was- I don't want to receive food other people have fingered.eww. And for that reason I will not eat at Zipps again. The food was ok- no complaints on taste.  The place is for sports watching and drinking anyway. Good crowd for the Stanley cup............

I miss the old chinese buffet. I was my families favorite buffet. the closed it and redid the whole inside. Does not even look like same place on the inside. But they changed the taste of some of my favorite dishes. They did add alot of food to the buffet and ice cream ( not soft serve)  But the few dished that I loved are changed forever. We're not going back. Not a horrible place- You may like it. But I miss my dishes:(

Cute shop. Nice employee. Great cupcake descriptions. Taste earns the one star. Cake was ok. But the buttercream frosting tasted cheap/not good.    We had a groupon for $40 worth for $16. I wouldn't get them again even at that deal. We tried a variety. Only the german chocolate was anygood.

I had Gigi's in Las vegas and when I found out they were opening in Phoenix I drove Opening day from 19th ave and Camelback to Ray and I17- Totally worth it!!!!  I bought my favorite Miss Princess and tried their new cheesecakes- To die for!!!!!!! Gigi's has a TON of frosting, which I love. But I found the best way to eat it is to pull the paper off and smash the cake into the frosting on a plate or in a bowl and it with a spoon or fork....maybe that goes against the whole point of a cupcake? But with something so delicious, who cares??????   The coconut Macaroon was tasty and the Orange Cranberry Walnut was a surprise- I really liked it.  I don't know why, but my least favorite is the wedding cake and that is their biggest seller. But honestly even my least favorite GiGi's is 10x better than a fry's cupcake. Just saying:)

I don't know what the other posts are talking about.? I love Gigi's cupcakes. Fridays are my favorites because they serve Miss Princess cupcakes which are my all time  favorite. Thank God those are only served on fridays. The peppermint patty and milk texas chocolate are tatsy also. I plan to buy so to serve at my christmas party this year.    The think I love most about the cupcakes are the frosting and there is a ton of it!   I tried the cheecake cupcakes that they started serving, they taste pretty good also. I only wish they had coupons or  buy one get one deals sometimes.

On my first visit to Dutch brothers- I asked for a second to order- told them it was my first time. They we're so freaking friendly- It was like rainbows, Christmas, butterflies and unicorns all wrapped up into one cashier/ barista. Never met someone so friendly- very nice change. They also made some suggestions. Then gave me a punch card almost punched full so I would come back- Great CS. the coffee was great too!

We tried Spoke & Wheel today for Lunch. It was really Good! My husband had the original Hatch Green Chili Burger. He loved it. He didn't want the honey on it and I talked him into it. He said it really was delish with it on there. I had the Sausage Panini. I'm glad I chose it, wow tasted so flavorful. We shared Nacho Mamas. I've had Nachos at a lot of places. These were just a few Large chips, but each were covered in toppings. I Loved them! My husband loved that football was on a million TVs. For me, I wish it wasn't but this is a tavern so it wasn't a deal breaker for me. WE Will be back!!!

I have tried a lot of salons in the valley. This was the cleanest place I've visited. They also had some of the most expensive options for mani/pedi's I've seen that weren't in a hotel or on a cruise ship. Basic pedi is $25 but it includes hot stone massage. The most expensive pedi I seen was $70- I wish I had the $$ to try it:)  Eyebrow wax is $10 so not every price is jacked up. As far as gel/shellac colors: They have the most I've seen one nail salon have. They are friendly and do a great job.     What did I like best?? They put a huge plastic barrier in the tub ( massage chair/pedi chair) I've never seen that before. They also use gloves and together I really like that!!

Address is listed wrong- It's 4001 E Bell Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85032  The pizza was really good NY style. But the staff totally outshine the food. I came in with a friend asked if they could do a pizza half/half. They said they could even do quarters. We didn't need that but would be great for families:)  My friend is in a wheelchair and he is total care. they offered to cut the pizza in small bites. I didn't even ask. That was sweet of them to pay attention- And very helpful. We will be back:)

Nothing gross or super bad. But, Nothing special. I bought a small New York cheesecake for my husband. I had a Chocolate cake with white frosting. We also purchased three cookies- Chocolate chip, kitchen sink and frosted sugar.  The chocolate cake itself had a good taste, the frosting wasn't as good as Bashas imo. The cookies weren't as good a toll house. Like I said, Nothing was bad, just forgettable.  One negative-  On their website they list a Mini pie schedule. What mini pie they are serving for that day. I went in just for Thursdays Cherry pie, for my husband who had the day off and I wanted to treat him to something special. No cherry pie.I asked what other pies do they have- NONE They weren't doing any pies now due to low sales. I get that. But come on- Update your website!!!

Went with 6 others for the Whimsical Library- We escaped in 57 mins and had an awesome time! The rooms are fun here and well appointed. This one is a mission so you are NOT locked in. So if you have a friend that says " No way can I get locked in a room, even if it's a game" Take them to this one. They won't be freaked by the idea of being "locked in a room". This was such a fun time. By the way, Staff at Epic are awesome- Thanks everyone!!

Even after having Shake Shack in New York, and thinking it was over hyped, My nephews wanted to eat there. Wait in a line out side, just to get in. Order Burgers, fries and drinks . $2.80 for lrg Iced tea. No refills. Maybe you can if you go to the counter? But with the horribly long line, I didn't bother. You are paying the price of a sit down burger, Maybe someone should come around and refill for you?? Or, Hey Shake Shack- Put the drinks on the OUTSIDE of the kitchen and we'll refill them. $44 for three burgers and fries and no refills......
