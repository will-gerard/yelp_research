What can I say but "Meh".   A friend and I shared the special omelet of the day which had jalapenos, corn, black beans, avocado, green chile, bacon and cheese in it.  It was huge and more than enough to share.  But it wasn't particularly tasty.  The bacon was overcooked and greasy, and I actually like my bacon very well done!  The jalapenos either weren't in it or had no taste and the green chile was bland. That baby should have had a huge scoop of fresh pico de gallo to accompany it to give it some flavor! The breakfast potatoes were almost burnt and tasted like they had been cooked in old grease that remained behind to coat them!  The wheat toast was actually a soft long wheat roll, cut in half and toasted -- not tasty at all and I don't want "soft" toast!  The coffee was good and the service was attentive.  Based on the quality of that meal, I wouldn't go back .. I'd eat next door at Liberty Market instead!

Excellent chicken tenders and biscuits.  I also like the fish combo they have for Lent.  Lobby was nice and clean.

We've been dining here periodically since 2002.  We ate here again on 7/16/11 and enjoyed it as usual.  From experience, we know that the portions are large, so we opted for two meals and an appetizer this time.  Tried the Kash O'bademjan for an appetizer for the first time.  It is a mixture of roasted eggplant and whey, flavored with sauteed garlic, onions & mint.  It is served hot with plenty of hot pita bread.  It is very flavorful and we loved the roasted garlic garnishing it and would love to have had more of it!! We shared the Chicken Filet Sultani which has a skewer of tender marinated  chicken breast and a skewer of koobideh.   Both very flavorful, tender and moist.  We also ordered the Gyros beef which was excellent.  The homemade gyros sauce was outstanding; very creamy and an excellent compliment to the spicy gyros beef. Of course, a huge platter of delectable long grain basmati rice accompanied the meats.  Their rice is truly lovely; definitely some butter swimming lovingly through it along with saffron.  Excellent rice!  Another nice meal at the Persian Room.  And we had enough to take home for a second (but lighter) go round today!  Yum!  I don't think it earned a 5 stars this time as the men's restroom (according to my spouse) needed some serious attention and the timing of the food delivery was slightly off.  We received our main meat dish before they had delivered our dinner plates which we needed since we were dining family style.  The platter of rice was about 2 minutes later arriving than our dinner plates.

We stayed here to be near a party in Ahwatukee for Memorial Day.  Lovely grounds .. beautifully manicured and really lent a sense of being at a resort. The casita studio we had was very nice.  Extremely clean and nice quality bath amenities.  Very comfortable bed.  All of the furniture was in good condition.   Having a lanai that looked out on the grassy green landscape was delightful.   Easy check in, ample parking and the resort felt well tended and secure.   We did not golf or use the pool.

We enjoyed a very late lunch here on Tuesday 2/19/13.  We arrived around 2PM, well after the usual lunch time.  I'm always a bit trepidatious about eating later than the usual meal times as the food quality sometimes suffers.    Darius, the waiter was extremely pleasant and informative about the dishes.  We ordered off the lunch menu which includes a green salad with onion, tomato and cucumber and rice with the dish.  I had the Chicken Filet-Kebab with basmati rice.  I have to commend the chef on this dish.  It was well seasoned and they accomplished the trick of grilling the chicken and it was still tender and juicy!  Well done!!  My husband had the Salmon with Sabzi Polo.  The salmon was tastefully marinated in their own special sauce and was served with their Sabzi Polo rice.  The rice is basmati mixed with with fresh garlic, dill weed, parsley & cilantro.  Wonderful, wonderful rice!!  We both loved it.  They have an attractive patio so you can enjoy outdoor seating.    The decor indoors is tasteful.. not particularly exciting but acceptable.  We were very pleased with the food and service and look forward to dining at Pars again!

Met a friend for lunch here today... neither of us had eaten here but she had heard good things about it.     We decided to eat family style and try a salad and a pasty.  Ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad and the Chicken Pot Pie Pasty.  The Chicken Tikka Salad deserves 5 stars.  What a taste treat!  Loved the spicy tikka masala with the crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and lots of red onions.  Nice contrast of hot and cold, spicy and mild.  And the mint yogurt dressing... spectacular.  Wonderful companion to the chicken and provided a "cool" contrast to the spiciness of the Tikka.  Kept in theme with the Indian spices with a modern salad dressing twist.  Excellent.  I'd love the have this salad often!  I was rather disappointed in the pasty.  The chicken was rather dry and I found it heavy on the thyme.  Veggies in it were tender and well cooked.  The crust was lovely:   light, flaky and flavorful.  I'd give this pasty a 3.    Service was good (a bit slow bringing the check at the end), ambiance had a British Isles pub feel.  Good experience over all and I'll be back for the Chicken Tikka Salad and to give a different pasty a try.
