Jordans has been closed for 3-4 years now. Much to my dissapointment because I always enjoyed going here for lunch and getting their tostadas.  RIP Jordans.

I wouldn't exactly call this the best gyro I've every had, nor would it be a close second - or third.  The gyro was made with pre cooked pieces of (beef/lamb) gyro and not sliced off a cone. I'm not sure where this new trend is coming from, but I've had a few gyros from othe Med. places around the valley, and all were made with the same or similar pre packaged gyro pieces.  In case any gyro / greek / mediterranean restaurateur cares, the pre packaged gyro meat is NOT GOOD. I'm just not sure what else there is to be said. If you can't do a decent gyro, I'm just not coming back. Sorry. :/

This is probably my favorite neighborhood bar, and mostly because it's just a hop skip and a jump from my front door - or a scoot on my bad*ss kick scooter. (like a razor scooter, but more awesome)  Lock that puppy up (again, bad*ss scooter reference here) on their bike rack, hop in with your pals for a late night clandestine meeting of the minds - at least that's what it'll seem like after a few of those $3.75 well drinks on a Friday at 9 or 10 pm, when in reality, it was just two or more buffoons boozing around making fools of themselves.  I'd say that I'm more a fan of neighborhood type bars than dance clubs, mostly because they tend to be lighter on the wallet than the latter. Call it a dive if you must, but I wouldn't classify George like that. Sure there's the obligatory pool tables and darts that make up a good dive. On any given evening, you might run into someone toting along their children for the 'grille' part of this bar and grille, but really, it's certainly more bar than grille by hefty proportions. I can't recall how many nights have ended at George, but you can rest assured that there will definitely be more.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, come meet George, he's kind of awesome.

It's not like you can go just anywhere for over the counter pharmaceuticals, hair brushes, feminine products, a $4 copy of Flashdance (1983) on DVD, and a turkey sandwich; office max and payless shoes certainly don't have this selection.  This is a convenient spot in Central Phoenix for picking up those cold and flu-pills, tissues, a bottle of water, filling a prescription (24 hours a day), or visiting their Take Care Clinic. Every so often I need to visit a medical professional to diagnose weather I've got Rhinopharyngitis, Pertussis, or the Avian Influenza. If you're like me, then the take care clinic is the perfect spot for you. Special note, if there's bone sticking out from your leg, you've shot yourself in the forehead with a nailgun, or forgot to properly secure the overhead lighting before stepping out on stage as Ebenezer Scrooge for the opening night of "A Christmas Carol", this is not where you want to end up.  Unless you schedule an appointment, getting in before the clinic opens at 8am doesn't really help much, you just end up waiting until 3-5 minutes before 8 so you can get your name in on the computer. If you're not quick about it, then some people who came in after you did might get in before can. I'd aim for about 10 minutes before 8, park yourself at one of their terminals and check every minute past 7:54 am until you get prompted to enter your name. If you're quick, you can get in and out. I heard some days are better than others, and some days have no wait at all. The day I was here, there were about 6 people all wanting to get their name in for an 8am appointment also; I ended up with the much desired #3, I think.   Aside from the whole getting your name in to the computer at the beginning of the day problem, the Nurse Practitioner was super friendly, knew her stuff, checked me out, and sent me on my way.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, you might want to try the ER if you're carrying your pinky finger in a cup of ice.

I like coming here from time to time, just walking in the place smells like fresh fruit! I'm not a fan of the veggie-fruit mixes but if you are, they have them here. Go for one of the strawberry based blends for the lowest calorie (fruit) mixes and you won't feel too guilty for such a tasty treat. My favorite is an orange blend. Mix in a boost for some added energy or brainpower and superpower your way through the day.   ...although im not really sure you get enough boost to achieve super power status, I like to pretend I do! (cape sold separately)

NOT reputable business. Keep playboys around as reading material for guests. Charged me for services I didn't ask for and didn't know I was paying for.  I went in for a haircut, during my visit the gal trimming my hair also trimmed my beard and eye brows; she didn't ask so I assumed it was included. The haircut was good; no better or worse than camelback barbershop near bestbuy or a&d near 7th st and camelback.   While paying I was charged extra for the beard and brow trim services. She WAS going to get a better tip, but changed my mind when I found that I was charged for that service.  I don't plan to return here and one star only due to this shady practice. Otherwise it's an ok place for a cut, just be sure and tell them you don't want extra stuff if you're not planning to pay for it.  My wife was waiting for me while I was getting my haircut and after we left, I found out that most of the magazines available for reading while you wait were playboys. In my opinion, a reputable business should NOT keep this type of material around. Then again, I wouldnt really consider this a reputable business.

In a world where up is down and left is right. Where the Clintons have a chance at a third term in the White House and their greatest opponent is a business suit wearing riches to rags to riches to rags to riches story personified, whom everyone loves to hate. A world where there's hot and there's chicken and there's Thai. The people of Tokyo express decided to take the hot, the chicken AND the Thai, mix them up into one delicious meal and called it "Hot Thai Chicken".  That's right mister Trump, I implore you. Please, put up that wall, put it right up around Tokyo Express and never let me leave. I'll be just fine here, eating the world's sorrows and troubles away with this bowl of Hot Thai chicken on my lunch break. It smelts guns in the hands of people everywhere, brings peace in war torn African nations, this bowl can end world hunger. Is there anything this delicious bowl can't do?  Warning, no guns were smelted in the making of this review and the world is still hungry, but if they were to make enough of these bowls of Hot Thai Chicken then maybe, just maybe, Siberian children wouldn't be cold or hungry anymore.  Happy yelping Phoenix, eat more Hot Thai Chicken!

Visited Bacchanal because of a restaurant - com coupon I picked up. They could stand to update this place a bit. The seats all seemed to have their padding worn out and I tried 3 different seats from neighboring tables. If you plan on pacing your meal out longer than 30 min or so, you might end up with a soar rump at the end of your visit.  They are not located in a great part of town and you could easily miss them if you weren't looking for them. On the south side of thomas just east of 30th street by a few feet.   The food was neither good nor bad. The greek salads were good and the pita bread they bring was great. I ordered a gyro platter and the gyro meat was not shaved off the spit like one might expect, but it seemed to be more like thin pieces of meat fried in a pan on their stove top. My guess is because they don't do a high enough volume that an entire cone of gyro would be too wasteful - although I could be wrong. Either way, ive had much better gyro from other establishments.  If you're looking for better mediterranean food I would recommend cypres grill over on camelback, just next to the trader joes. I can't attest to the atmosphere much, because when we were there on a friday (maybe it was saturday) around 6pm, we were litterally the-only-people-there. As we were leaving another group came in to eat. Seems like everyone already got the message that there are better options for greek / mediterranean.

While it's not quite the upscale retail that the Biltmore touts just down the road about a mile and there's no movie theater to speak of, two of my favorite spots in Central Phoenix are located here. Nordstrom's Rack and Cypress Grill.   Town and Country has stepped it up with a new expansion. They've now added to their quiver a Nordstroms Rack, Five Guys Burgers, Potbelly Sandwiches and Cafe Rio. Well Suited, their 'My Sister's Closet' men's shop, has been added, replacing My Sister's Attic, their second hand furniture store. Aside from bargain shopping at Nordstrom's rack, I do enjoy visiting Cafe Rio on Tuesdays for $1.75 tacos all day long. If that doesn't tempt you, Bianco just might. His newly re-branded Italian Restaurant Tratoria Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco might just get you to swing by.  I tip my hat to you Town and Country, I'm gonna show you some 5 star love - cause I like you so much. I used to only swing by when I needed a thing or two from Trader Joes, had a hankering for an awesome Gyros from Cypress Grill, or wanted to stare in awe of the gym rats coming out of the LA Fitness - I still want to know just how do I get my abs to look like that? I'm guessing less froyo from Yogurtology would be a start, but that would be a sacrilege - let's not speak of that again, ever. Now you can find me here for shopping and dining more often than ever before.  Happy Yelping Phoenix.

I like coming to Marshalls when looking to save a few $$ off brand name clothes, accessories, and house hold items. They always seem to have a clearance rack that brings cost down on their shirts, shorts, pants, etc even more so than their normal value prices. They're great for picking up new work out clothes about 1/2 the cost that you would down the street at Sports Authority. I've never bought shoes here, but they're decent prices also.  Most of the items they carry are last years styles, which most people wouldn't really care or notice. I like to swing by here and last chance when I'm in the discount shopping mood, you can usually find at least one or two things that work for you.  Happy Shopping my friends!

A few years ago I went on a mission to find a new barber.   I should have learned to recognize a winner by now, but I stubbornly decided to try out four or five other local barber shops before circling back to this one. After receiving multiple questionable haircuts from less stellar spots within a 5 mile radius of Camelback Barber, I finally concluded that Camelback Barber will give you a good looking cut, at a fair price, and you'll leave without a feeling like you just stepped out of a strip club. For $20 including tip, I leave with a look I'm proud of, every time.  In my vision quest I saw things like magazine racks filled with playboy magazines, doors closed during regular operating hours, cheap / small barber chairs that barely fit a young teen, and shady business practices at the checkout counter. You'll find none of that here.   Want to read something while you wait? Grab the sports magazine right there. Looking for a "3 on the sides and clean on the top"? This is your spot. Want to randomly swing by on a Saturday, you're out of luck 'cause that's the only day they're closed - just come back tomorrow.   This is one of those spots where you can come and get a manly cut. With no blow dryer or nail polishing stations in sight, bask in the knowledge that this place caters to the guy who just wants his hair to look good, finished off with a straight razor trim around the edges. Sorry to say, but if you're looking for a waxing or mani pedi, you're looking in the wrong place.  Lookin' Good Yelpers!

I have been here on multiple occasions and each time the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Their selection in 38s-40s seems pretty limited.   I've been twice now when I was looking for a particular color / style. When asked if I needed any assistance, the answer to "yes, I'm looking for x type of jacket in x color" should not be to say, "hold on a few minutes while I" do something and then to leave your customer waiting 10+ min for an answer.  Save yourself the hassle and go check out, pretty much anywhere else. I hear they sell jackets and suits at the thrift stores. At least there I'm expecting to be ignored and have to fend for myself when trying to find something.

Ended up here for a late night ER visit with a family member. They were able to handle an episode of PVST without blinking an eye. The nursing staff was friendly and reassuring to us, which is helpful in ANY type of emergency.  If you're having a non-immediate life threatening heart emergency in the valley area, this is where you would want to end up. Hey, they ARE specialists in heart related medicine.

I'm glad to see a shop pop up just next door to My Sister's Closet dedicated just to men. They used to have a few racks inside of MSC, but now have expanded their men's collection into the spot where their furniture shop once was. I guess furniture didn't sell quite so well.  Let's face it, I never could find anything in the one rack of stuff in my size, and I'm not real sure I wanted to ever admit shopping for myself at a place called My Sister's Closet anyway. Now that I can check into "Well Suited" I don't have to hide my check-in's anymore. ;-).   Find nice to new quality (not actually new, but new like) men's apparel here for a fraction of the original cost. Shoes, Suits, Shirts, Wallets, Watches, and Pants, you'll have a difficult time NOT finding something that piques your interest.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, time to suit up!

How many bites does it take to get to the lamb filled center of a gyros-pop?  I'd say one, cause if you can't find gyros on the first bite, there's probably something wrong with your order ;-) ... are you sure you didn't order the chicken?  And you thought I was going to say something deep and meaningful, you obviously don't know me that well.  Cypress Grill is my favorite place for a gyros in Central Phoenix. There's a handful of them around (gyros spots that is), but if you're looking for a gyros and within a few miles of this place, I'd say skip all the rest. I've tried at least five or so spots that serve em nearby. You'll spend a couple bucks more here than at the other places, with a gyro running you about $8, but I'm happy to conclude that Cypress is my favorite gyro in town.  The hummus here is good, so is the spanikopita and dolmades. For those of you who are carb counting, you can get your gyros in a salad too. I've done that a few times myself. All in all a solid choice for medditeranean dining - one of the better spots in the area.   Happy Yelping Phoenix!

While I can't say I've ever actually purchased anything for myself, I keep coming back to My Sister's Closet. It's probably more the thrill of the hunt for that perfect (shirt/pants/jacket/etc) that keeps me interested. Maybe its just me, but they usually don't have much in my size. They do have plenty of Med - Large sizes and 35 - 40 waist pants.  FYI MSC - I wear a 38s jacket, size S collared shirts, a 30ish waist with 29inch inseam, and size 7 1/2 - 8 shoe; just in case you were wondering. ;)  My wife seems to have some luck though. She's found a few designer shirts, a couple pairs of 7 jeans, and even some cool Coach purses. I think this is definitely a better place for the female shopper.   Best of luck to all you shoppers; and who knows, maybe you'll bump into me in there not buying something. :(

I've been to Havana café before, but it's been at least 5 years or so. Long enough for me to forget that this place was forgettable, in my own opinion. Take that for what it is, I don't eat much Cuban food.  I was unexcited to find that Havana café didn't have any spots available to park, and the rest of the open spots in the parking lot were all labeled specifically for the next door flower shop, coffee shop, and so on. What was I to do? I risked it and parked in a flower shop spot, and well, I wasn't towed, but I still felt like I was doing something wrong by parking there :-/  Ultimately, I was lured back with a groupon they had available a few months ago. My first mistake was expecting that I could use my groupon to pay for meals which both totaled above $30 (the value of my groupon) and ALSO ordering additional items from their HH menu. I asked for two of their mojitos and was told that I couldn't order HH since I was using a groupon also. I obliged and let them know that water was just fine. My guess is they realized I wanted to buy my drinks in addition to our meals, and the waitress came back a few minutes later and told us she would put our drink order on a separate check. Nice save on their part - I was a bit miffed at first!  My second mistake was not realizing how excessively sweet their mojito was going to be. I saw at the bottom of the glass, what appeared to be a large spoonful of sugar. In this case, it didn't help the medicine go down. After them accommodating me with the drink order and all, I didn't want to make a big to do out of this, so I soldiered my way through my drink.  I ordered a shredded beef dish, and my wife a shredded/pulled pork dish. Apparently Cuban's like bell peppers and onions a heck of a lot more than I do. The peppers and onions with my dish accounted for about 3/4th's of the meal. I ate two or three slices of the peppers and a few slices of the onion, but was not satisfied with the small amount of beef the meal came with for a sticker price of $16, and even at $8 since I was paying about half with the groupon.  My third mistake was choosing to sub their house vegetables for the beans and rice. I don't eat that many carbs, so often I will exchange potatoes, fries, rice, etc for whatever vegetable is available. The waitress explained that it was a mixture of squash, zucchini, mushrooms, and a few others. In reality, it turned out to be a few slices of squash, a few slices of zucchini, a couple of mushrooms, and guess what, a bucket load of chopped bell peppers and chopped onions. They were also nice enough to charge me extra for the substitution with the meal now totaling $18 before tax and tip.  Two $6 mojito's, two $16 meals, an upcharge for the vegetables, and a $5 forgettable appetizer (I don't exactly remember what it was at this point). I was leaving with a $65 meal after tax and tip, hey, I saved $15 on the groupon though.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, I hope I made it apparent how unimpressive this spot is. Maybe you prefer pan fried peppers with a bit of beef and a side of... pan fried peppers.

Before pop culture coined the term tween; but only by about a year or two, I had the privilege of playing ice hockey as a young teen. I had a few 'wordy' on ice debates over this or that during a peewee season. "I think you'll like they way I use 'Pow!', 'Bam!', and 'Zap!' in a sentence." I 'politely' explained to the defense-man, alas, I was cordially invited to take a 'break' from the sport I so loved. Time marches on, or so the song goes, and fifteen years later I still hadn't picked it back up.  Shazam! I got this wonder-brained idea about a year ago, I'm going to play ice hockey again!   Fifteen years later, the call to get back on the ice was overwhelming, I felt like Uncle Sam himself was calling me to serve my country, do my duty, stand up and take action! I spent a few months debating weather I would do it or not and decided to take the plunge.  Being the frugal person I am, I chose to pay the entire season instead of game by game. You'll spend closer to $20 per league game, instead of $25 by paying it upfront. I picked up a few new pieces of necessary gear I didn't already own, a helmet, gloves, athletic protector (those boys are sensitive you know) ;-), and away I went.   Suiting up that first time, brought back that feeling of sporting camaraderie you can't find anywhere, at least outside of a locker room. Taped the hockey stick, laced up the skates, pulled on the jersey, buttoned up the helmet, and away I went. The puck dropped for my first rotation on the ice, I skated my heart out, and holy cr*p! What the heck was I thinking! OMG, I think I'm about to die, right here, on the ice.  I looked up at the clock, and it was only about 67 seconds into the game, go figure. My next thought was "I knew I shouldn't have paid the 'entire' season. Now I have to come back :-/ "  Fast forward nine months, I'm still going back week after week. I can finally make it back to the car after a game without limping the entire way there, and no longer feel like I'm punishing myself for the future possibility of keeping up in Adult League Ice Hockey.  I've been told by a number of skaters that while Arcadia doesn't have the best facility, they've got one of the better patches of ice in the valley. Lucky for me, I live only a few miles from here, short commute!  Check them out for a free skate, drop in for an open hockey, or join me for C-League. There's always a beginner class happening on the weekend for anyone interested, they'll even loan you out some gear if you'd like to 'try before you buy' so to speak.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, see you on the ice!

Wowzers, now this is a spot I could spend all my $. Spend just a few minutes in here and you'll know what I'm talking about. So fresh and so clean doesn't really scratch the surface. I popped in on a whim, cause I'm always in the market for a spiffy new sport coat, and was pleasantly surprised at just what I found myself getting in to. I was immediately greeted by Peter, such a friendly and knowledgeable guy, and he took the time to show me just about everything in the store and without blinking an eye, proceeded to grab every perfectly fitting jacket in the place. They had super affordable and great looking jackets all the way up through custom tailored jackets and suits, and please don't forget the shirts and socks. You'll leave this place looking like a rock star, a movie star, a shining star; no matter who you are, shining bright to see, what you can truly be.  Oh the feel of a perfect fit, you just can't compare. Happy Yelping Phoenix, I'll see you in your one of a kinds. ;-)

Oh burrito, where art though?  I haven't had a good burrito in quite a while and decided that I wanted to visit Carolina's in South Phoenix (12th st and Mohave - just south of Lincoln) . I hadn't been to Carolina's (Cave Creek and Cactus) since we moved from North Phoenix a while ago. As my first visit to their downtown location, I was quickly reminded why this is one of my favorite Mexican food spots in Phoenix.   I waited in a line filled with of "out of place" business casual, police officers, and Mexican nationals alike. This isn't exactly what I would call the normal business lunch locale; you don't come here for the ambiance. The food is served on styrofoam and paper plates, and the table service doesn't exist. I definitely don't suggest taking your special lady here on a date night.  With ala-cart tacos and burritos ranging from a couple $ through six or seven, this place is easy on the wallet. This is exactly what I was looking for and I savored every last bite of my Machaca (aka: beef) burrito, and taco! That was one great meal. Now I can scurry back to my mid-town office and finish up the day in style. Carolina's claims the valley's best tortillas; which can be ordered by the dozen and taken home, and you won't hear any disagreements from me. The fresh made tortillas are super thin, tasty, and never seem to break when you eat them, like many others will do.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, Carolina's serves up some mean Mexican delights!

Not rating new times specifically, but their friday food truck event. Visited here for the tlicious tacos. I would avoid this event on fridays and hike the extra 2 miles to get to the food truck friday event at the phoenix public market. Its a nicer atmosphere and a bigger selection of food trucks to pick from.

If you've been looking for the best kept secret in Phoenix, this isn't really you're place, cause it's not that much of a secret anymore. If you're looking for an urban escape into the farming community of Phoenix past, then be sure to stop in for a visit.  I've always heard good things about Morning Glory café here at the farm at south mountain for brunch on the weekends, we had a visitor in town, wanted food, was looking for an experience we've never had, one plus one equals two, so we ended up at the farm!  I'm so glad we chose to dine at morning glory, the entire place is super cool. Lined in an old pecan grove, there are a handful of shops to check out, some artist studios, two or three places to eat, and the grounds are a great place to take in also. This was the perfect stop for brunch before we headed up to the top of south mountain to check out the views. For anyone in the market, this is also a wedding venue, it's a venue like none other in Phoenix - if you're looking for that. :-)  Happy Yelping Phoenix, be sure to put this on your bucket list for Phoenix if you haven't been yet!

Yelpers, If you don't read only one review this year, don't read this one; the service was bland, but so was the food - this review can't be much better.  Quick tip, Phoenix in the summer months is not ALWAYS hot, carry a light jacket or sweater in your car, sometimes it's coooold, brrrr. Why some establishments think that 100+ degrees outside means it should be 65- degrees inside is byeond me. We visited on a Saturday before a movie and they seated us just under what seemed to be an ice vent, I was glad I had that sweater in the car.  My first impression of the Elephant Bar was "What type of food do they serve here?" Are they Mexi-merican, Italian, American, BBQ, sandwich, Asian Fusion? I'm not sure, and neither does their 30+ page menu. They've got the most confusing menu I've seen from just about any restaurant. I think I saw the same menu item on three separate pages with at least two separate items, why? Don't ask me.  I FINALLY, after about 25 minutes, ordered a barbecue glazed chicken sandwich with the macaroni and cheese side - which they touted all over the menu and table top flyers (the mac n cheese that is). By the way, turns out that their idea of barbecue glazed is a bland piece of chicken with barbecue sauce added after it's put on your sandwich. I could have sworn that barbecue glazed means it's cooked in a fire roaster / oven with the sauce.  I ended up sending the macoroni and cheese back after 4 or 5 bites, the noodles were way over cooked and the cheese was bland, I guess I could have added salt, but didn't really feel like paying for mediocre macoroni. I also requested them to add jalepenos to my chicken sandwich, and they sent out basically an entire jalepeno pepper on the side not peeled, not chopped, not diced, but sliced about 5 times - I ended up cutting it into smaller pieces myself with the butter knife they supplied me so I could actually add it to my sandwich.  The chicken wasn't pink, so I THINK it was cooked, but it was walking the line of cooked and not cooked. After about one fifth of the chicken sandwich I decided the flavor wasn't going to get much better and ended up sending that back also.   The bill arrived and to my surprise the chicken sandwich was still on there. I asked the waitress "are you really going to charge me for that meal?". She went and found the manager to which I had to explain again all the reasons I didn't want to eat the food they provided and why I didn't want to order something else instead.  My wife's hambruger was good though. If you're here, hungry, and confused at what to order, get a burger; I think it's the best thing on the menu and difficult to get wrong. Who knows, maybe they can. :-/

Arizona mills mall is one of those hit and miss places. Sometimes you find a great deal on just what you're looking for, sometimes you find something you didn't know you needed on sale, and sometimes there's nothing for you. Dubbed an outlet mall by most locals, you will find normal retail and full priced kiosk vendors mixed in with outlet shops like neimann marcus, jc penny, sears appliance, and burlington coat factory.  The outlet shops will usually save you a good 30-50% over retail cost, but sometimes less. I don't shop here often since it is about 10-15 miles from Central Phoenix; where I hail from, and I usually end up spending more than I prefer.  Be sure to make this a destination for all you discount and penny pinching shoppers.  Happy Shopping!

This is a great place to shop, grab a bite, eat dessert, relax, or just hang around.  Eat at one of the many excellent restaurants like Christopher's, Seasons 52, Black Chili Mexican, and Capitol Grill. Swing by Royal for a cappuccino, iced latte, or your favorite coffee of the day. Savor frozen delight from Haagen Dazs or Mojo Yogurt -- ahhh my sweet Mojo, you and I have been in an on and off relationship for the past year now... by off I mean the 3 or 4 days a week I'm NOT there :)  .  Movies in the park nights are fun to go to; gasping, laughing, and crying with 200 of your closest (people you probably just met). Get there early for good seats, (about 30 min or more), otherwise you'll be stuck behind a tree or some tall guy you can't see around. Be sure to bring a lawn chair along or a blanket to throw down if you'll be attending one of these events.  The shopping is top notch - but be sure to bring your wallet. Most shops here will cost you at least your first born child, or an equivalent value.  Happy shopping to all my yelping buddies!

I might have a macaron habit. But please, don't tell my addiction counselor.  OMG so much amazing happens in the 43rd express kitchen. The saying "you don't know what you're missing" comes to mind when I think of everyone who's not had one of their a macaron ice cream sandwich.  Never had the pleasure of experiencing Phoenix best macaron?, then get here, now. Unless that is, you've been here before, and if you've been here before and not had their macarons, I don't feel bad for you, I feel sorry. Sorry that you didn't order the best macaron you'll experience in Phoenix. With flavors like strawberry ice cream, taro ice cream, and Oreo cookie, the ice cream alone is delish, but they combine their home made ice cream with amazing macarons to form Ultron, defender of the universe. But seriously, it's a friggen macaron ice cream sandwich.   It's rare that I head west for anything gastronomically delightful but this is just one of those places. If death must find me west of central phoenix, let it find me at 43rd express with a fistful of macarons and a mouth full of ice cream sandwich!! :-)  Happy yelping!

I was looking for a place to listen to some cool and funky live music and Chars hit the spot. Soul Power seems to be a staple here, and they didn't dissapoint. The place is kind of a dive, reasonably priced libations, fun atmosphere, an all around good place to hear some decent music. It's got kind of a small dance floor and seating is pretty limited. You might want to try to get in early, or you might be standing. Parking is kind of a bear, and you will generally need to find a spot in the neighborhood a few feet away.

Living just a half mile away for the past few years, I really had no excuse to avoiding Mi Patio for so long. I tend to stay away from any place that chips are considered a course in your meal and deep fried is a cooking method. While I still stick to this mothodology, its nice to break pace every few weeks to keep your sanity. I mean, you cant live on veggies for too long without getting a craving for something tasty, meaty, and full of carbs.  Mi Patio was just the spot. We ordered a spinach and cheese chimi and a couple orders of their tacos; chicken and beef. After filling up on chips and chowing down the great tasting tacos, we couldn't even begin to eat the chimi. While my expectations for a next day chimichanga wasn't so high up there, it was actually still good the next day. I imagine that it would have been all the better had I eaten it fresh from the kitchen. Maybe next time ill go light on the chips. Ive heard their $1.75 margaritas a decent; however, I cannot personally attest to this. At $1.75 it can't hurt to give it a try though.   Either way you slice it, Mi Patio is a solid choice for your Mexican delights.

Spectrum is one of those places that you love to hate. Go here for the Costco, the Target, the Harkins movie theater. You'll find most of these shops without having to enter the actual mall, with the one exception being Costco. Wal-Mart, JCPenny's, and Ross are here also, but I generally don't shop there but every 'once in a while'.  Walking through the mall, you'll find random clothing shops, a game stop, a few shoe stores, and some other unimportant make-up and perfume shops. If it weren't for Costco or the Harkins, I would likely never stop here. For all you light railers, this is the last stop on your way north. If you're public transit bound, this is an ok place to get your shopping done - as long as you're conveniently located next to a rail stop.  Happy Yelping Phoenix.

I heard rumors about Karl's Quality Bakery from some of my friends and through other reviews, I just have to try it out. Saturday mornings from 7 to 8 am around the valley seems to be quite lovely; barely any traffic on the roads at all. All you weekend pleasure drivers should give it a try. The drive north on 7th avenue to Dunlap took about 10 minutes, and my head danced towards thoughts of sugarplums... and other sweet treats. I hope they have a good Apple Filled donut!  Arriving this early just about anywhere means you pretty much have the run of the place. There were one or two other customers and the scent of freshly baked goodies was almost overwhelming. I had my eye on the freshly made quiche, which looked awesome, but that's not what I was really here for. I asked the girl at the counter "What's your most popular donut" and I got a list of some of the local favorites; Apple Fritter, a variety of fruit / cheese danish, a few different cream filled goodies. MMMM... what a way to start your Saturday! Unfortunately no Apple Filled donut, but the Apple Danish looked like a pretty good alternative.  Mental note: Next time bring cash, $10 minimum order with credit cards. We ended up ordering extras to meet the $10 mark and the thought of bringing home donuts is scary. I know that if I bring baked goods into the house, its leaving one of two ways; me eating it, or my wife eating it. I'm pretty sure we all know how that's gonna turn out. We sat at one of the cafe tables and began sharing. Yes, that thing you were taught when you were two. Sharing is caring!  At the first bite of the Apple Danish I was hooked. In my head I am working out this scheme to convince my wife that it was no good and she wouldn't even like it. Since that probably wouldn't work anyway. I gave in to my selfish desires to finish the danish and shared the other half, with my other half. The Apple Filling was just about perfect.  Thank's for such great pastries and desserts. Happy Yelping Phoenix!

After deciding I liked a particular stool in the copenhagen store, I was trying to make my way back to make a final decision. I ended up finding out about this place while searching yelp for the copenhagen store operation hours and noticed a clearance center. I'm so glad I did!  I wouldn't exactly say that you can get a matching set of just about anything, they have an eclectic selection of mix and match clearance items. I was specifically looking for bar stools at the time, and was able to find some that originally cost upwards of $300+ retail cost, and ended up grabbing them up for just over $100 a piece. The stools I found here were better than the one I was going back to the store to check out!  It was great, I was able to stay in my $300 budget and come home with great looking and quality chairs as opposed to "meehhh, whatever" I could get from the local swap meet or craigslist.  Im so happy I found you Copenhagen Imports Clearance Center, I will definitely be back if I ever need more furniture!

For all you alliterates out there. I've experienced quite a line of lackluster lunchroom locations as of late, and I'd like to learn what little leprechaun is leaning their bad luck my way.  With that out of my system. I've got to say this place has got the market cornered on mediocre. A quick visit to their official website shows a claim of "Voted #1 Mediterranean/Middle Eastern ..." I assure you, they did NOT get my vote.  As far as the service was concerned; we were one of two tables seated about 6 - 7pm on a Wednesday, the waitress visited us 1) to take our order, 2) deliver our drinks, 3) drop off / pickup our check. Someone from the kitchen delivered our food. Our waitress didn't seem rude during the few times she did swing by, but also wasn't excited for us to be there.  We started with an order of hummus, which turned out to be neither here nor there, then ordered a Gyro Plate and Kafta (Kubideh). The gyro meat seemed pre-packaged and the kafta (grilled ground beef) seemed underspiced and bland. We did; however, order a tasty chicken skewer side, which was good.   Nothing about this meal was really fantastic and I definitely not worth coming back. I'm guessing they do most of their business during late night after people have had too much to drink to realize they're eating a sub par meal.  Be sure to let me know where your favorite Gyro is, 'cause I'm still looking!

I've recently become a fan of higher end department store shopping. Quality clothes just seem to fit better and Dillards at Fashion Square is one of my favorite stops. This location outshines the PV Mall shop, with more space they offer wider selection of sizes and styles. Sometimes you just stumble on the perfect item that fits you just right.  For only $100 (on clearance of course) this weekend I picked up a tailored suit, I do love a great bargain. I might have spoiled myself with this as my first tailoring experience. Im guessing $100 is no where near the norm and at that price I might just be able to get some new shoes to match; BONUS! A few times a year you can catch these sales and clearance events.   While I generally wouldn't mistake Dillards for a discout shopping retailer, their normal prices are what you would generally expect to pay for Boss, Ralph Lauren, Perry Ellis, and Calvin Clein.  If you're not stopping in during the normal retail rush times like saturdays from 11am - 2pm or during a holiday weekend, shopping here is a pleasant experience. They seem to be staffed appropriately and you can usually find someone to help if help is needed. I generally don't like people helping me shop and the staff can usually tell when people prefer to shop by themselves and will leave you be. If asked if you'd like assistance, a friendly "No thanks!" is usually all it takes. Shopping here just makes sense.  Happy Shopping my friends!

"I can't believe I drove so far for this place" comes to mind when I recall my experience here. Excuse me to my pals who think this place is all that. I guess we all can't have the same opinions; we'd just be robots. Maybe  they had a bad day, as in a really bad day - with the word really underlined, twice. Problems with the kitchen, problems with the service, problems with the fact they're even open. The high point of this experience was waiting for my friend to show up, I stopped at the second hand store next door and didn't buy anything.  At this point, I don't care to remember what I ordered, I just remember trying to order it a 6 of 7 and the waitress scoffed at me and asked if I was sure I wanted it that spicy. "You can always make it hotter, but can't make it less spicy." I guess that was true because I gave in and ordered it a 5. What I didn't realize was that the waitress meant to say I ordered a 5 on a scale of 1-100, cause this didn't have any spice at all. bleh...  After a few bites I calmly explained that on a scale of 1 to 7 that my dish was more like a 0, no spice at all. Her response, if you really must know, she said, sorry, we just had a "big order from a table of 6 people" if you want the kitchen to re-make your order, it will be about 30 minutes. Instead of waiting for 30 minutes, I asked if she could bring me some thai chili peppers and some chili paste to add to my dish, I'd just take care of it myself instead; she showed up with chili oil and soy sauce. :-/ Thanks, I guess. I pushed through, spiced up my dish to satisfaction and 'enjoyed' the rest of my meal, but mostly the conversation with my friend and not really the meal or the dining experience.   My friends dish was pretty sub satisfactory to her, and she asked the waitress to just take it back. The waitress didn't seem to want to just take the dish from the table and leave it at that, after insisting on making a new dish to replace the unsatisfactory dish about five times. Instead of just returning the dish, she gave in to the waitress and selected something different. While her replacement dish was better, but not awesome, she ended up getting charged for the replacement dish she didn't really want to begin with.  Given the choice, next time I'll aim for taco bell. Not exactly apples to apples in comparison, but at least I wont have to spend a lot for crummy service and mediocre food.  Happy Yelping Phoenix.

In an unlucky turn of events, I ended up having a grand experience with my new favorite, Grimaldi's.   More of my reviews lately have began with me aimed for one place and ending up at another, and I'll start with "this one isn't any different." Maybe it's a trend, maybe it's indecisive decision making, or maybe it's just plain old coincidence. Mostly because I don't believe in fate; I'll go with coincidence, but for those of you who mystify the universe in a shroud of hocus pocus, wizardry, and magic then feel free to call it fate.  While I make the claim of "My New Favorite" I'm not really comparing it to much outside of oreganos, humble pie, upper crust, and streets of new york. I've yet to visit bianco, cibo, and plenty other wild-west, pizza slingers round these parts.  Earlier this week I planed my birthday lunch at Cibo in Downtown PHX. A calorie and carb packed, delicious birthday meal. Much to my dismay, a quick pre-lunch look at the Cibo menu (on their website), seemed to be lacking a certain sauce and cheese covered, carbo loaded delight. After a call in confirming this fear, a fast yelping finger pointed me to Grimaldi's in Scottsdale. It didn't hurt that they had also sent me a voucher for free birthday pizza; I guess my wife signed me up for their email list. :-)  On Sunday afternoon; even though they were busily serving plenty of customers, there was no wait. I placed an order with the server for a manhattan while I checked out their menu. Regretfully I had to send my drink back, it tasted more like straight whiskey, and bottom shelf at that. I decided to go with the house red wine in stead; which was decent and chilled, a bit odd for a red, but it worked out well.  We dined on a large meatball, ricotta pizza and a large mediterranean salad. The salad was huge, big enough for 3 people to share, and each end up with 2 portions. The pizza came out with a perfectly crisped crust, evenly distributed slices or meatball and ricotta, and was delicious!  We finished off our meal sharing a blueberry cheese cake AND a canolie, it was my birthday after all. I cant say that I've had many canolies in my life, but if they're all this good, there will be an eternal place in my heart set aside for these delectible deserts.  Happy dining friends, and godspeed to all your yelping fingers!

If you've ever gyros hopped before, you know that not all gyros are created equal, and until today; if asked, I would have told you my favorite gyros is at Cypress Grill. I am happy to report, opinion changed!  I've had this spot bookmarked for quite a while now, the trouble is that I spoiled myself by moving a mile away from where I work; I've got dining, shopping, and work all within 5 minutes. There's 4 froyo shops, 5 gyros spots, 6 grocery stores, countless dining, dive bars, comedy clubs, open mics, music and more. Travelling outside of my acceptable radius is quite the big deal. There's usually some type of planning, engagement, or craving involved that just can't happen inside my bubble.   I recently was in the Tempe area and decided to strike while the iron is hot. If you visit expecting the usual quick serve, show up, eat, and leave setting - you're only partly right, but Haji-Baba is so much more. Haji is a Middle East / Mediterranean market - who also makes one heck of a gyros, and I'm happy to stamp my opinion of "Personal Favorite - thus far" on it.   I ordered up a Gyros DLX - sans tomato. This thing comes falling out the pita with a generous portion of gyros, lettuce, onion, tomato, tatziki, feta cheese and all wrapped up with a hand made pita. Best yet, it's under five bucks! - if you're not into the hand made pita or fresh of the block feta cheese, it's younger brother "Gyros" comes with the same delicious lamb and beef gyros for about $3.69.  Though, why stop at just the gyros? This place is flushed with great imported foods and fresh made desserts to order up from their market. Shop through aisles of items like spices, sauces, pickled beets, harissa (spicy pepper sauce), cookies, and so much more. Check in their glass case for fresh made pastires, olives, and feta cheese. On a whim I tried out one of their harissas and haven't looked back since. Now I'm blending up my favorite spicy pepper hummus with jalepeno, garlic, and harissa week after week. - message me if you want the recipe; it's awesome, I promise ;-)  Happy Yelping Phoenix - break outside your bubble once in a while and you'll be surprised at what you can find!

There aren't many of us out there, but I'm Luxy enough for this to be my neighborhood coffee stop.  Now don't go telling people my dirty little secret; but truthfully, coffee isn't really my 'cup of tea'. You know what is my cup of tea? Tea! and Earl Grey takes top billing. Earl really knows his tea, and Lux has that too. With a few minute walk, bike, or scooter ride from my front door to Lux, the wife and I like making this a frequent stop for a hot beverage or cold, people watching, dessert, or snack outing.   While here, I wouldn't be surprised to see one of the top billed Yelping regulars, out of town coffee pilgrims, or Juan Valdez himself. I'm told by my buddies and my girl the coffee here is just that good.  Lux has a menu of fresh baked pastries, goodies, and other breakfasty items, like eggs, veggies, and bacon. There's also a full bar back there for those of you who venture past the coffee and pastry line. Careful though, 'cause Lux can get packed during morning, lunch and evening hours with most of the prime spots filled up already by gaggles of laptopians doing a work from "home" type of thing.  Now I've not personally worked from a coffee shop before, but I sometimes wonder how much 'work' is actually getting done. Maybe people just claim to work and are really just hanging out for the uber cool ambiance or the free wifi. I think Mr. Valdez did have is iPhone out the other day trying to connect up to the Yelp app.   The walls here are spotted with local artistry that is on a seemingly endless rotation. Come back in a week or so and you might find something new hanging up there. If your a light rail fan, pop off at Campbell and Central and stop on in!  Happy Yelping Phoenix! It's time for today's caffeine fix.

People actually travel to phoenix just to shop at last chance... for us Phoneticians, we have the luxury of visiting as often as we want! Every nordstroms and nordstroms rack in the country filters into last chance located right in your backyard.  This is the ultimate bargain shopping much better value than just about anywhere else you might even imagine. $200 shoes ($30-$40), $100 shirts ($10 - $20), $300 jackets ($40 - $60), $250 pants - jeans ($30 - $40), $100-$150 pants - jeans ($10 - $20) - be careful not to spend your entire paycheck here.  If you show up at opening expect a crowd - be sure not to push, shove, run (yes, people actually do this here) or you might be "asked" to leave for the day. Shopping here is a sporting event.   While the prices here are awesome, buyer be ware. Make sure to thoroughly check and try on everything you're planning to buy. There's a no return policy and everything in there was either a returned item or something that didn't sell at nordstroms or nordstroms rack.

Fans of Mall shopping everywhere drool over a visit to the upscale Scottsdale Fashion Square. There's just so much to choose from it'll make your head spin!  My favorite shopping spot in the greater phoenix area; Dillards, is tucked neatly away here. They are a huge store with a nicely put together mens dept, which is easily just about the same size as other stores themselves.  There are plenty of nice food court shops and full service restaurants to choose for when you get worn down from an afternoon here.  I might suggest that you hide your wallet when you visit and bring cash or you might end up spending more than you mike like ;). As always spend responsibly and happy shopping my friends!

Sweet Potato fries are outa sight and they do their FEZ burgur just right. They're the CenPho hot spot for lunch, dinner and late night!   I've had their burgers, pita pizzas, and salads. The atmosphere is cool and eclectic and the staff is friendly. Order yourself a flavorful martini with a few to choose from, like their raspberry feztini; always a great choice. Check them out if you're in the CenPho area and deciding where to dine, you won't be disappointed.

This is the idyllic breakfast stop for all you yelping food fanatics. Matt's is an upscale diner that will keep you believing breakfast really is the most important meal of the day; no matter how many carbs you just ate. My game plan was to order a meal and save half of it for later or even the next day; unfortunately, it was sooo good that I just couldn't stop.  When they asked me what type of toast I wanted I half shrugged it off as just give me the "whatever" flavor and I won't eat it anyway. I generally stay away from generic tasting food in an effort to make my calories count for at the very least and awesome tasting meal.  Even the toast was awesome! If they didn't bake the loaf of bread that my toast came from just as I was making my order, you could have foolded me. The hashbrowns were awesome, so much that I ate them all.  I wish I knew how to make my scrambled eggs taste like Matt does. You will not be dissapointed with any meal you order here.  Words just don't give this breakfast joint justice, so be sure to check out all the pictures!  Expect to pay about $10-11 per person after tax and tip for one of these awesome breakfast meals.  **WARNING** Don't eat here if you are looking for just another breakfast place. **

Stopped in for dinner a few weekends ago, been looking for a reason to give them a try. Started with a carne quesadilla, the wife and I shared a pork burrito and an order of their cheese and spinach enchiladas.   I think the quesadilla would have been better as chicken, the carne was a little chewy, but then again - that is the way some people prefer carne. The pork burrito was excellent and the enchiladas were top notch also. I skipped the chips and salsa since they were an added few $ - Im glad I did because the rest of the meal was filling.  I loved the flavor of the rice as well as the beans. I wouldn't really call them the best ive ever had though; we do live in Phoenix. The rice and beans capitol of the world if im not mistaken.  There's a few options here for all you bargain shoppers out there. Theres a margarita yelp check-in offer as well as a restaurant - com coupon you can pickup; however, you can't use them in combination with each other. We picked up a $25 off $35 which is an excellent option for two - ended up leaving at just under $20 with tip.

I must be dreaming, 'cause this place is just too cool.   Tucked in side an easy to miss house with a barely noticeable sign even during the day, find yourself sipping down a bottle of your favorite libation or have them pour you a locally brewed craft right out of their ice cold taps. Like many of the stops along Roosevelt in Downtown, The Roosevelt elevates the cool of the area by a factor of ten.  After having one too many and falling into a happy stupor, I slipped back tipping myself off the edge of the seat. I must have gotten quite the knock on the head. Waking up dazed, confused, and aimlessly wandering about Roosevelt Row in downtown. That must have just been a weird dream I am awaking from. "How on earth did I arrive here?" and "why am I so hungry?" I wondered. Good thing the Roosevelt is just down the way, I decided to stop in for some of their tasty appetizers to squash this ravenous hunger.  Maybe I'll have their grilled cheese or tasty deviled eggs. mmmm.  Time seemed to slip by faster than reality did. Getting up to leave, night turned into day in almost the blink of an eye, and it was a scorcher of a day. The temperature displayed on the electronic board down the street read 109, but my internal thermometer told me that surely it had to be at least 153.  "Here's my chance", I thought. "This unsuspecting Phoenician strolling my way is my ticket out of this hell." "Excuse me, do you have the time?" I asked interrupting him mid whistle. "I guess" was their response, and as they looked for their pocket watch, I pushed them over quickly grabbing their sun shading umbrella. That guy must have had a little vampire in him, because no sooner than the umbrella began shading me from the streaming rays of sun, did he burst into dust and was whisked away by the scorching winds. All that was left was a pile of dusty clothing and a pair of half scuffed shoes.  Suddenly, the ground gave way underneath my feet, opening an endless chasm of despair. I fell into the dark abyss, only to find myself suddenly waking from this crazy dream and on the floor next to my bed.   Maybe next weekend I'll go easy on the brew, or maybe I'll wake in a few minutes to the calming sound of ocean waves lapping against a sandy island beach somewhere. Only time will tell.   ...Beerception

I heard the summoning of my fellow yelpers confidence in past experiences of pure delight. Exotic pleasures upon my pallet were soon to come.   If you simply can't choose for yourself on which meal to dine; their savory beef, flavorful chicken or succulent pork are sure to inspire. I experienced the "Cola and Pineapple Soy Braised Angus Short Rib Roast", "Signature Pernil Asado", and "Pernil BBQ Quesadilla"; all cooked to inspire moments of bliss.   The Short Rib Roast; my favorite of the three, leaves no room for disappointed, and that's a personal guarantee ;)  April and May are the perfect months to enjoy their outdoor patio, tucked inside the conspicuos hidden courtyard at the corner of 7th street and Palo Verde.   As usual with many establishments I visit, snag a great deal by picking up a $25 off 2 entree's certificate from restaurant - com. With certificate in hand, you could walk out the door for close to $30 including tax and tip. During the hours of 3-6 pm (Tuesday - Saturday), try appetizer portions of most popular dishes for $5 - $7 each.  Happy dining my friends!

I can't seem to find anyone who's lost their leaf; trust me, I've looked. There are no people around here without their fig leaves on.  Tucked in the mouth of the Tigris River, Adam and Eve had the tree of life; hidden between Jobot and Nachobot on 5th street and Roosevelt, Phoenicians have the beer fridge at Lost Leaf.  I'm not one to suggest taking a bite from the forbidden fruit, but I probably won't object if you feel like throwing back a few beers while listening to the sweet sound of nightly live music, hanging out at one of Phoenix's favorite watering holes. Just like Adam and Eve and their whole fruit incident, if you partake in the beer here you might just realize you're naked by the end of the night; though, hopefully by that point you also find yourself in the comfort of your own bed, with any luck you'll also have your favorite gal by your side.  Lost Leaf has tapped 3 or 4 kegs for your drinking pleasure, and they've also got 100+ beers in the bottle for you to enjoy. No matter how you like it poured, this uber cool spot serves up everyone's favorite suds. Now, don't feel like I'm trying to con you into sinking your taste buds into one of these refreshing beverages, but try the orange blossom brew they have on tap; it is surprisingly good and might just bring you existential enlightenment!  I happened to stop by on a night they were serving up a heavy helping of funky jazz beats. I've been here before when the entertainment wasn't not quite as cool. Either way you slice it, the $10 cover charge is always waived no matter what time you show up. No that's not just for ladies night either, it's every night.  Come in tow with your favorite designated driver, or hop the light rail and exit at Roose if everyone will be partaking. Now let me slither my way back to where I was going with this, get here, grab a brew, chill out, and just let nature take it's course.  Happy Yelping all you thirsty Phoenicians, enjoy the forbidden brew!

I came for the shortleash and left with a cupcake!  OMG that peanut butter cupcake was awesome... shhhhh... and don't tell my wife I had one, she would be sad I didn't bring her along. I will just need to bring her round to make up for it. ;)  I stopped by for a hot dog from shortleash dogs - they're setup here for lunch on Tuesdays. I swear that food truck is the single reason I cant seem to make any headway on my diet / workout regime.   The cookie shop seemed to beckon me inside... its a good thing I had a light breakfast that morning. I was tempted to try the banana cupcake (their all vegan treat) and  brown velvet (red velvet without the artificial color) but went with the peanut butter (the personal recommendation from the guy behind the counter). I can't begin to tell you how many calories one cupcake is, but it was ooooohh sooooo delicious and worth every bite.  Not exactly what I would call inexpensive ($2.65 / cupcake) but well worth the price for the five minutes of blissful delight!

I'm paraphrasing here, but this is how the typical customer service call went in almost all my experiences.  Cox - Hi, how can I help you.  Me - I am having trouble connecting to the internet at the moment. I've just finished resetting my computer, my router, and my modem. I checked all of my network cables, I'm able to communicate with other computers that are behind my router, and I just can't get to the internet. Is there a reported outage in my neighborhood at the moment?  Cox - Sorry to hear that. Can you please try unplugging your cable modem, waiting 15 seconds, and plugging it back in?  Me - Uh, yes, like i said, I just did that like a minute ago.  Cox - Oh, can you just try again for me anyway?  Me - I'm pretty sure there's a problem with the internet, can you just confirm if there are any reports in my neighborhood at the moment.  Cox - Are you sure it's not your wifi? Can you try plugging your computer directly into the modem?  Me - (getting upset at this point) Sure, I'll plug my laptop into the modem. ... still not working. Is there a reported outage in my neighborhood? I'd just like to know if there's an outage that is getting worked on or not.  Cox - I'm showing that everything is online and no outage. I think maybe you should try resetting your modem again.  Me - Really, do you have to ask me all these questions before you can answer if there is a reported outage in my neighborhood or not?   Cox - Yes, we need to go through the troubleshooting steps first.  Me - FINE - I'll reset the dang modem again, for the third time. Yep, still broke.  Cox - I think there is a problem with your cable lines, have you ever had trouble with mice? I know that sometimes animals can chew through the lines. If you'd like I can send a line repairman out to your house, but there will be a $100+ minimum charge to fix the cable lines in your house.  Me - are you serious?  Cox - Yes, I have seen this before.  Me - no, ARE.. YOU.. SERIOUS? Do you have a supervisor I can talk with?  Cox - My supervisor is busy at the moment, and they will tell you the exact same thing I am. I have the same information they do.  Me - I really don't care, is your supervisor's supervisor available?  Cox - I'm sorry, why don't you try resetting your modem again.  Me - GIVE ME YOUR SUPERVISOR NOW, please. I no longer wish to speak with you.  Cox Supervisor - Yes, I'm showing there is a reported outage in your neighborhood and the service truck is actually working on it now. If you look down the street at the X and X intersection you should see them doing scheduled work right now.  Me - ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! YOU'RE DOING SCHEDULED LINE WORK ON THE CONNECTION IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AT 7PM ON A WEDNESDAY EVENING? THIS IS REDICULOUS, AND WHY COULDN'T YOUR OPERATOR JUST TELL ME THIS WHEN I CALLED 45 MINUTES AGO?  Cox Supervisor - I am sorry sir, there is no reason to get upset at me the way you are.  Me - PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR SUPERVISOR CAUSE YOUR BEING BELIGERANT WITH ME RIGHT NOW.   Cox, this is the reason I dislike calling you, no this wasn't a one time, unique experience, I've had very similar conversations over multiple calls. I'm so glad the relationship we had has finally moved on, and I'm not looking back!

I guess my expectations were a bit too high for such an expensive place.  We made reservations for our anniversary dinner. In general, my dining experiences surround casual dining establishments. Low key, relaxed atmosphere, friendly wait staff, the type of place that will stop for a minute or two to have a conversation instead of go through a check list. Serve bread, bring water, fork on the left, soup spoon above the plate, ask about appetizers, talk about specials, etc., etc. I got the feeling that this was a stuffed shirt type of place, and while I *was* wearing a tie that evening, I wasn't expecting a by the book, average service with our $50 meals.  Where to begin? I hate that this is basically going to be a check list of everything that went wrong, but here goes.  - requested olive oil for the table bread which took about 15 minutes to arrive.  - the drinks we ordered took 20+ minutes to arrive. - wifes steak wasn't cooked to order. The waiter asked if she wanted it butterflied to be sure it was cooked to order, she said yes. It was not butterflied and started bleeding when she cut into it. - we ordered a side of brussel sprouts that didn't actually come out with the meal. - I had to remind the waiter that we didn't get our brussel sprouts - the sautéed brussel sprouts and bacon tasted mediocre and came with crunchy bacon bits, not bacon - I've had way better and for a lot less $$. - the steamed vegetables (a carrot and snow peas by the way) went through more of a blanching than a steaming and were basically raw veggies. - option of baked potato, mashed potato, and potato au gratin as your included side, how much potato do you think I eat? - run of the mill steak house music playing over the speaker system.  My expectations were that I would get an amazingly delicious meal, nice friendly evening, perhaps some live ambiance music, a waiter who remembered what we ordered without a reminder, and service that happened a bit faster. I understand that kitchen problems aren't the fault of the wait staff, but I assumed at the cost of these meals, the waiter staff would notice a missing side dish, and a steak that wasn't butterflied.  If you care to know, yes we did mention the foul ups with the food order, they did comp the brussel sprouts, they did cook the steak a bit longer, the manager came to the table to apologize, and we did receive complimentary desserts. Although the desserts were complimentary because of our anniversary and not the foul ups; not that I was fishing for free stuff. I certainly appreciate the apologies and effort put in to correcting what went wrong. I was generally expecting a *nice* place like this to be on their game the entire night and was soured by the overall experience.  Donovan's sure knows how to make a special evening, well, not so special.

Barry is the man. He will hook you up and leaving you wanting to come back. He exclusively sells suits, well shirts and ties as well I guess. Believe it when everyone says he's the best price in town. He is likely the best price in the country, and that's no lie. All that value with a friendly conversation to boot.  If you're looking for men's suits this is where you need to stop. Save yourself the trouble and skip trying to shop around at department stores, specialty stores, men's warehouse, or even direct from a manufacturor's storefront. Barry has what you need at a price you just can't say no to.  Basically, you can't afford to shop anywhere else, 3 for the price of one just can't be beat.

Food = mehh, service = subpar, what else is there to say?  Save your money. You'll be happy you did.  I know i'm asking for Tina to stalk and insult me on Yelp by posting this bad review, but Tina, the truth shall set you free. You can choose to accept it and change your restaurant's operating policies, or you can ignore everyone and struggle to make things work.

Oh, St. Francis, how can you get is so right, but so wrong all at the same time?!?!?  I particularly love their HH menu with delicious meal choices stolen right from their regular menu for under $10 and $5 cocktails before 6pm every day, even on weekends. To have a great HH in Cenpho, you've got to have good food options and good drink options, not just one or the other.   I've ordered close to half of the items on their menu and hands down, my favorite is the chicken salad sandwich. I usually order it sans toast, and without the bread. The dressing on the chicken salad is delicious, but slightly over powering, so I also suggest asking for half of the dressing. I also enjoy the Meatball appetizer, but I would suggest sharing this one with a couple of people. It's basically two or three big meatballs, while delicious, I've usually had enough after one and am ready for my chicken salad.  I always enjoy their vegetables; they're oh so delicious, perhaps even up in the amazing category. This has been hit or miss for me, but I usually try to get them to serve whatever their vegetable is that day. I enjoy St Francis for their fresh and delicious flavors, they can do some great things with veggies here, the trouble is they don't ever seem to want me ordering them. I'm at about 50 / 50 when it comes to them subbing out veggies for the fries, so when they don't seem to want to accommodate, I generally get the side salad instead. They usually give me some response like, the kitchen can't make you a side of vegetables, that dish comes with either fries or a side salad, and I ultimately give in on the salad.   Honestly, why do you need to be so b*tchy about subbing out fries for vegetables, as if there is no kitchen back there. I'm not asking for free food, charge me for the change and call it a day. Is it impossible for you to imagine someone might NOT want to eat fries!?!?!   On one occasion, I was here with a large party of 15 or so for a birthday meal. We made reservations and requested that separate checks be accommodated; well, it appears there was a breakdown between the person who made the reservation and the wait staff who apparently don't like doing separate checks. They refused to accommodate this request, and it started to get awkward. I was not looking to make a big deal out of it, I took care of the bill myself, and went on about our evening without upsetting the nights festivities, but that could have been handled better, much, much better than me paying for everything myself.  A few notes to St. Francis operations. Why is it so difficult for your staff to accommodate something other than fries with a chicken salad sandwich? You're a restaurant, you make food, I want food, please make me the food, so I can eat the food and leave happy.  Why take a reservation with the stipulation of accommodating separate checks and then have your wait staff groan about how they can't do separate checks?  Staff should be accommodating where they can, I don't feel I'm being unreasonable here to expect to be able to order what I want to order, and pay how I want to pay.  I guess the moral of this story is, if you want to come with a large group, they will probably make a big deal out of it, so be prepared. If you want to change up your meal with something as *crazy* as vegetables, good luck. With all that in mind, I still think St. Francis is one of my favorite spots. I'll be back by myself for sure, I might even bring my friends, but only if I'm planning on covering the check.   Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I've tested plenty of fuel in my vehicle and hands down, shell and texaco both give me the best MPG results. I will get anywhere from 18 - 22 MPG with shell and texaco and almost everywhere else, it's more like 16 - 18 (18 on a good day). Sadly, this particular shell charges an added eight cents per gallon if you use anything OTHER than cash. seriously? if you're gonna be the ONLY place in town that does this, at least make it reasonable, like a $.50 surcharge. How rediculous, 8c per gallon :-/   I don't like filling up here because only because I never have cash on me - who carries cash anyway? I'd be willing to even do a debit transaction, but this place charges extra for that too. Whatever, I'll just fill up down the street, where I don't get an added fee.  edit According to the following info I found. Retailers are giving a "discount" for using cash and NOT charging a surcharge for using a card. Effectively, they're raising the price of gas, and discounting cash customers.   - ocregister. com/articles/credit-344140-cash-card.html Apparently, "The dual pricing emerged after credit-card titans MasterCard and Visa reached a court settlement in late 2010 with the U.S. Department of Justice, said Jay McKeeman, spokesman for the California Independent Oil Marketers Association in Sacramento.  Until the federal settlement, Visa and MasterCard prohibited retailers from giving consumers discounts for paying with cash or with credit cards that charge lower fees.  Part of the retailers' agreement (with credit-card companies) was you could not charge a differential price for credit cards vs. cash. But the credit-card companies agreed under the settlement to stop enforcing that provision.  Ostensibly, service stations aren't charging more for credit-card payments, they're offering a discount for cash payments.   Some questioned whether the cash-price signs are legal under state law. California law prohibits surcharges for credit-card use. But discounts are OK, so long as the retailer posts both prices. "

Dillards clearance center and me were destined to meet. Any time you can mix great quality, name brand clothes with low, low  prices it is a recipe for shopping, and Dillards Clearance has perfected the recipe.   The store is huge with racks upon racks of earlier / last season items straight from the racks of Dillards. This center and the one in metro center mall both receive merchandise from all southwest US dillards stores, according to one iffy sales representative.  I scored with a 5 discounted Murano, Calvin Klein, and Perry Ellis shirts, 2 or 3 sweaters, a jacket, a pair of dress pants, 4 packages of new mens "under garments", and a pair of dockers shorts for about $150 after tax. A bargain shoppers delight - you just can't go wrong!

Whoever's got the Gold makes the rules and Mrs. White makes gold in that kitchen.  While I'm pretty sure that's not the golden rule Mrs. White is talking about, I think this one is more fitting! Her Smothered Chicken Fried Steak, dripping in gravy might as well have been dripping in gold, it tasted awesome! I ordered mine up with Mac N Cheese and Sweet Potatoes, deciding on those over the okra and the collard greens was tough, but worth it.  Unless you're on one of those reverse diet plans eating a minimum number of calories like an Olympic swimmer, you had better check you diets at the door; this ain't no place for calorie countin'. I told mine I was going out for a light jog on my lunch that day; "You really don't need to come along." I told her; I hope she bought it!   The ambiance here is likened more to a waffle house experience than 5 star dining, with old school fast food type booths and seating. While you're here, read the wall closely enough, and you will find many Cool signatures penned right on to it. Famous musical entertainers, local and nationally accomplished athletes, and other famed diners can all be found to have dined here once upon a time.  Our waitress was surprisingly fit and trim for someone who serves food at a Soul Food spot. I had to ask, "Just how do you keep that girlish figure while working and dining here?" which she replied with "running back and forth with orders all day" and "hiking my favorite trails" on her off days. I have to note that she is now my new inspiration. Maybe I need to get a job here. I wonder how that would go over for my diet plan? Hmmmm.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, it's time to go for gold!

Often considered God's Chosen Freeway by the locals - or at least me, this is the nicest way to get from north Phoenix to central phoenix by way of train, plane, or automobile.   1) The 51 is not a through-way. It connects only north to south valley, so it is rare to see large trucks using this highway the same way you see them on I-17.  2) The 51 is a state road. It is beautifully maintained by AZ, and not federally ignored, like I-17.   For such reasons, it's rare to see an accident or serious backup during your commute, although I'm not saying they don't happen from time to time.  If you live in north Phoenix and commute to downtown or central Phoenix Monday to Friday, this is the route for you. Worth the extra mile or two if it's out of your way. Skip the frustration of I-17, pass by all the red lights you'll get taking 7th street / ave or another road aimed north to south.   Views of along this drive are pretty nice too, you see mountains, clouds, desert-scapes, sunrises, and sunsets. It's not littered with billboards and advertisements; but you will see one here and there.  Happy driving Phoenix. See you on the 51!

Tucked away in a secret part of Tempe is the little known Tempe Marketplace. Taking a walk through this quaint little shopping center, you'll find boutique shops like Target, BestBuy, Sport Chalet, Pier1 Imports, and JCPenny. If you search long enough you'll find the small entertainment venues, Dave & Buster's and Harkins Theatres. Say you're hungry too? Well that's no problem, swing by one of the cozy cafe's such as Chipotle, SmashBurger, Portillo's, The Keg, and Ruby Tuesday.  Yes, Tempe, this is the spot where you go when you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the mall experience, you're looking for relaxing window shopping, or a nice quiet evening out with your significant other.  If you fully believed what I've just told you, then I've got a bridge I can sell you in Brooklyn also. Starting at just $10,000 - I'm taking best and final bids this week.   Happy Yelping Phoenix, hopefully a little sarcasm is not completely lost on you. :-D

A solid neighborhood bar and the only Jets bar in all of Phoenix. If you're a misplaced Jets fan, be sure and check out the local Jets meetup group for Phoenix too, they meet here for every game. I don't especially love the food here, it's about as tasty as any other random sports bar in town, but the wings are a solid choice. They've got fish n chips, corned beef and cabbage, the usual Irish pub fare.   I don't find myself in this part of town often, mostly for the football; that's football not föötbäll or however it's pronounced, although they do play the soccer games too. They've got a decent number of tv's and a large projection screen to broadcast the games, the wait staff is friendly and the drinks are decent priced.   Honestly though, where else are you going to get to watch the best team in the NFL play with your closest friends? ;-)  Happy yelping Phoenix, are you ready for some football?!

There are very few places around downtown to have a drink and cigar, but this is one of them. Stocked by Churchill's cigars; a local cigar shop, Rum Bar has a reasonable selection of about eight or ten cigars and a bar full of rum and a mixologist to go with it. If you're into rum drinks this is also one of the best spots in town to get one.  There are definitely a handful of shops in the area you can pick up a cigar, but none of them are open past 8 or 9 pm, and none of them will serve you a cocktail while you smoke. When I'm out with the pals and in the mood for a cigar, it's generally not before 8 pm. You've got to have a bit of forethought for that, and I'm rarely blamed for foreword thinking, that's for sure. Sure the drinks are premium priced, and the cigars too, but this is the spot when you're looking to pair them up.  Note that smoking is only on their outdoor patio, and not in an inside lounge. It would be nice to find a spot with an inside smoking lounge in the downtown area, but beggars can't be choosers, right? :-/  Happy Yelping Phoenix, see you around downtown!

It's a sports store, like many others.   I wouldn't suggest driving miles out of your way to get here, but if you're in the area, they're a better place to shop than any big 5 or sports authority; although, I feel that comparing them to a big 5 is a real injustice to Sport Chalet's everywhere. Maybe we can just strike that comparison from the record - please.  I've been through here for bikes and bike accessories, work out clothes and equipment, athletic shoes, and warm hiking socks. They carry sports equipment for football, basketball, bicycling, baseball, and a couple others, no ice hockey equipment though, which isn't a big deal for most people out there; just me - and every other hockey player in town.  The prices here are neither better nor worse than any other retailer, but they do have a decent selection of the goods they carry. I've had a bike tuned up here on a couple of occasions and never had any trouble or regrets.   Overall if you're looking for something they keep in stock, they're not a bad place to check out.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, see you on the bike paths!

The story of two hippies and finally, a great idea.  In a land filled with broken dreams and grumbling tummies, two hippies met while attending a Phish concert. Recognizing each other as hippies by their standard issue, Grateful Dead t-shirts, big daddy; as he preferred to be called, introduced himself to Little "T". In this moment, the clouds parted while angels played their harpsichords and trumpets from a Farmhouse. "Hey, you like burgers?" Little "T" asked big daddy. "Hhhehheehee, of course. You ever seen the northern lights?" asked big daddy.  ... fast forward seven years ...  Little "T" finally had a great idea. "Hey big daddy, wouldn't it be cool if there was a burger shop where all the hungry people could come and eat a burger, fries, and a drink for just a dollar?" "No way man, burgers are like heaven and people would pay like, $10 for an awesome burger, fries, and a drink." he replied.  After years of debating and three failed marriages between the both of them, "T" and daddy settled on $5 as a great price for burger, fries and a drink. Today, you can find this $5 meal in Central Phoenix 365 days a year, except Sundays, holidays, between the hours of 8pm and 11am, or from 4:20 to 4:21 -- hippies gotta sleep; and, you know...  ;-)  Stop in for lunch one day (or dinner), order up their daily special, their house bacon cheese burger, or even a hot dog. While considering your options, browse the toppings list such as, fresh jalapenos, roasted hatch chili, caramelized onions, onion rings, house made habanero ketchup, and more.   Side note to all you spicy food extraordinaires, the habanero ketchup is down-right fantastic. In fact, I think this ketchup steals the show. While greasy burger spots aren't on the normal "bucket list", if you love spicy food and in some weird way make a list of all the places you wish you could try before you die, you NEED to add this to the list. I almost wish I could buy a batch of this stuff to take home - OMG that was spicy!  Oh, the burger and steak cut fries aint bad either ;-) I ordered the bacon cheese burger, sans the tomato, add jalapenos and a side of that delish house made habanero ketchup. It was a burger like none other I've had!  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I love ordering their food Thai-Hot (thats the hottest you can get here). If you like you're food spicy, you can't go wrong. Their pre-meal salads; which come with every dine-in meal, has an awesome salad dressing. They also sell their salad dressing for ($5) to take home. I forget how many oz. they said it was. I think its close to 12 or 16, but don't quote me on it. Every meal seems to come with a slice of fresh cut watermellon.  The watermellon is a nice refreshing pre or post meal snack and also light on the added calories; although the rest of the meal may not be.  My favorite dish is their garlic dish; either rice or noodle, ive had it with chicken and tofu before. The tofu is prepared in such a way that it has a crispy outside and a buttery inside. I don't think that I've ever ordered a tofu dish before and thought "I might order this again some time."   Their lunch meals will cost you about $10-$11 after tax + tip, so I don't visit all the time, but they are a great choice if you can't stop thinking about thai food and you're in the midtown area near central ave and thomas.

.... Guess I waited a couple months too long to post, cause it looks like this spot is closed :-/  A place I truly want to love, just missing that special something.   Overall, I really enjoyed my dining experience here, this is a great neighborhood spot which serves delightful Mediterranean meals. The owner uses his knowledge of herbs, sauces, vegetables, grains, and meats to create healthy, filling, and flavorful food. Our meals tasted as if they were cooked just for us by our favorite grandmother, with love and time; lots of time.  Our experience began in a quaint repurposed, home to restaurant conversion that you see up and down 7th street. Not quite tucked away, but easy to blink and miss on the south east corner of oak and 7th. We chose La Piccola Cucina because of a groupon certificate ($15 for $30 or $25 for $50) we went with the $30 after checking out their menu, but if you like ordering appetizers, you'll want to consider the $50.  I ordered meatloaf with couscous and grilled zucchini sides - the wife ordered pork roast with okra and Greek potato sides. I loved the meatloaf - probably the best I've ever had, the cous cous, the zucchini, and Greek potatoes were all really good, the pork roast was pretty good - just slightly on the tough side, and I didn't personally care for the okra, but my wife seemed to enjoy it.  Our main courses took about 45 minutes to an hour to arrive tableside; which was ok because we weren't gnawing at our fingernails, we used the time to have a pleasent dinner conversation. I would; however, highly suggest ordering appetizers to hold you over while your main courses cook, if you're hungry.   The owner was working the dining rooms, which was cool, but it seems they don't have a person just for waiting tables. I think the change that would really step up the dining experience here would be a legit wait staffer, there to refill drinks, bring table bread, suggest appetizers, tell you "that's a great choice" or "maybe you'd want to try this one", etc.  I will more than likely be back when in the mood for something other than a "would you like that with fries or a side salad" type meal you get at many restaurants.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I always enjoy a sqaure deal, and today was no exception. Having a shiny new restaurant*com coupon in hand, we made our way out for The Dhaba. I'm not too proud to partake in a coupon here and there. Let's face it, why pay $40 when you can spend $25 after tax and generous tip? Now that's smart shopping.  This place was a good decision. We really enjoyed the food, they're in a nice spot right off the light rail, they've got a cool Indian (dot - not feather) market and adjacent shops to check out before, or after, your meal.   The Adrak De Panje dish (marinated lamb cooked in the tandoor for those of you who don't know); while tasty, was a bit tougher than I was expecting. They could stand to provide a sharper knife with this item. I was here with my wife and mother-in-law and we all really enjoyed the Nawabi Murg Tikke (marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor).  Overall they serve great tasting food and India themed décor. The restaurant dining area echoed on the inside, which made for an interesting experience. We could literally hear what our neighbors were talking about. While they did have music it could have been a bit louder, felt like we could hear every conversation from all the surrounding tables. and I expect that this could have been overcome with ambiance level music or some interior curtains.  At one of the shops, we met an interesting and awesome guy behind the counter, my guess is that he's the owner. He told us about different spices and dietary info about different Indian foods. Had a fun evening learning about Indian foods!  Happy Yelping Phoenix! .... errr Tempe I guess. ;-)

I like coming by for those daily quick stop items. They keep an ok selection of produce for your day to day needs as well as some specialty pre-made, heat-n-eat meal items. They've got a selection of dairy, meat, and general grocery items including beer and wine.   They don't have a huge selection, but it does meet most necessity items. You likely wont get away with shopping here exclusively and will generally come here for specific items as you run low or run out. You will probably end up at a larger grocery store for your weekly / bi-weekly shopping events. Be sure to keep an eye out for their regular USPS mailings. You can usually find a $3 or $5 coupon to spend on $25+ dollars.  Happy Shopping!

Fresh and easy is super easy to get in and get out of when you only want to spend less than 5 minutes picking something up. While not the most amazing grocery store, they're great for those 'grab n go' necessities. I hope you don't mind running into your neighbors in public, because you're likely to see someone you recognize here. They're just too convenient of a stop to skip past.  They've got a decent selection of meats, cheeses, prepared dishes, breads, beverages, and packaged foods. I mostly stop in for bananas, broccoli, oranges, milk, etc.   A common misconseption is that Fresh & Easy sells "good for you items." I think some may have them confused with Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. The stuff here is just as advertised Fresh (98% of the time) and Easy (to get in, out, and back to your day.)  Im not sure how you get on their mailer, maybe sign up for something in their store like the rewards program. They usually send us out $3 or $5 off when you spend upwards of $20 or $30 in store coupons every 2 - 3 weeks. Not a bad deal and definitely cuts the cost of your daily needs by a good 10 - 15%. If you've got one of those in your pocket, it's basically free money!

Ruby and I have had an on again off again relationship for about 12 years now. It's been close to 3 or 5 years since our last scandalous meeting.  I like that Ruby has attempted to change her look with choices such as mashed cauliflower, and spaghetti squash. I even liked that she shows a bit extra with the calorie count on 'some' of her options. Makes choosing that much easier, although she does hide the calories on most of her selections. My thought on that one is that she likely doesn't want to scare you away by showing too much on items like her bacon, cheese, avocado, Angus burger. I can only imagine the distressed thoughts I would have had if I had seen the truth before ordering the meatloaf. Thanks Ruby for making it easy to splurge this time. ;-)  Apparently, about a 1/3 of Ruby's gastronomic repertoire now comes with her salad bar at no added cost, and my choice of meatloaf just happened to be one of those as well as the wife's grilled chicken. It turned out to be one of those surreal moments for me. I was excited to get a seemingly free bonus, but at the same time would THIS be the day I break the no buffet style dining promise I made to myself and the wife on that fateful day back in aught nine?  Unluckily for me, Ruby had left a little something extra mixed in with her 'mixed greens' that day. Who knows, maybe it was Ruby, maybe it was one of her ladies in waiting, or maybe it was just a random customer with a 10 inch locks. Either way, I was fully unappetized after serving myself some salad with a side of dark brown hair.   Maybe I should have jumped ship at this point, but how was I to know it wasn't going to get much better? The food was average at best, and the wait staff didn't seem overly apologetic about the added locks of love incident. In fact, the first waitress I showed this to didn't even take the plate from me, I had to hand it to the bartender behind the bar myself before I could get rid of it.  The meat loaf was 'mehh, whatever' and the grilled BBQ chicken wasn't any better. The only saving grace here was the cauliflower and spaghetti squash; but truly, those are dishes that can be made easily with a few minutes of prep work at home. Needless to say, I didn't walk away from this meal with a happy ending.   Sorry Ruby, but our on and off again relationship is officially off, but never again. Your services will no longer be traded for my hard earned cash.

Thanks Yelp, I know you're not a dating site, but Flores AC and my air conditioner are a match made in heaven and it was love at first sight!   It was a grueling day, manual labor in the hot Phoenix sun really does a number on you. Mid July, 110 degrees, sweating so much people think you just jumped in the neighbor's pool. whew. I get my underoos in a bunch just thinking about people who work outside. Luckily, I just have a quick walk from the office, to the car then the car to the perfectly cooled 87 degree condo in CenPho. It's on a timer and set to start cooling exactly 45 minutes prior to my daily arrival.   What the? What's going on? OMG. No. Please, no. Wait, NOOOOO. Now don't hyperventilate. You've seen this before. OK. Breathe, deep breaths. I think I remember someone suggesting to turn off the AC for an hour, killing the compressor. Sometimes the coolant lines can get frozen. Yes, that's right. I know its 110 degrees outside, but yes this sometimes does happen. I guess this is a good time to swap out my return air filter - it is a few weeks overdue once every 2-3 months. So after an hour; well, it could have been like 58 minutes, but I didn't really want to wait any longer. I cut the air back on, gave it 10 minutes and still nothing. Well, these tried and true AC tricks didn't quite cut it this time. Time to get someone to Yelp me out with this one.  I popped open Yelp and searched my way through Phoenix for "Air Conditioning", a handful of results showed up but really, my first call was Flores AC. They outshine just about everyone else that came up by a good 30 reviews and have a 4.5 overall rating. This is my guy.   I explained to him that I tried everything in my bag of tricks already, but I was just blowing a bunch of hot air. "No problem" he replied and said "I'll be there in 15 minutes." really? 15 minutes? whatever. "OK hunny, they'll be here sometime soon-ish." They said 15 minutes, but I dunno. I'll believe it when I see it."  ... Told you so, service guys and contractors, they never get here on time. 15 minutes. I knew he couldn't get here in 15 minutes; heh, now where's my free pizza? pssshh.  It took them 17 minutes to get here. I knew it, two minutes.   He had my AC fixed up in about 20 minutes, apparently a bad compressor. At just $160 for the part, the call, and his time - those other guys have done me wrong for the last time.   From walking in the door and discovering my AC wasn't working to happily signing the charge to my credit card, 1.5 hours - you just don't find that anywhere else. They were super friendly, family owned, and in business since 1980 something. Lets face it. 30+ years is longer than some people have lived in Phoenix, let alone been doing AC in Phoenix. Fully licensed, bonded, and insured; you don't have to worry about weather or not you're getting some Joe off the street; or George, Chas, or Parker for that matter.  Stay cool Phoenix and happy Yelping!  Quoted in weekly Yelp newsletter 4-24-13: http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=qr1pI_M35pIb6N5nMzSKMQ

**Warning** **Warning** **Warning**  This review is NSFW (Not Safe For Work). You might just end up reading it, calling in sick, *cough*, *cough*, catching a ride (cab, light rail, uber, lyft, friend, bicycle, skateboard, roller skates, shoes, or slippers) and spending your day at Hanny's instead.  Hanny's has a special place in my heart. Oh, Hanny's. You're close enough to my house to be an easy light rail destination, and just far enough for me to stay away most of the time. "Dangerous curves ahead" doesn't even begin to cover the tepidness one should take while ordering your $5 martini's, especially when you order them on the rocks, in a tumbler glass, and a couple of limes to dress it up instead. Your $5 martini special is always special and that's just why I like you, you make every hour happy and not just the hours between 3pm and 6pm ;-)  The one complaint I hear from most people and many reviews is that at Hanny's, there's no Happy Hour, I think you just have to know to order their $5 martinis. I generally consider happy hours to be happy only when they come coupled with a decent drink selection AND food selection, but those martini's, they make up for it.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, set your limit at two, possibly even one, be sure you've got a DD and have the happiest of hours.

Just a little tug, that's all it takes. Those dispensers ooze froyo; taste's like birthday cakes. With mounds of coconut and marshmallow delight. That Cookie Monster chills even the Phoenix night.  I know it's September and summer's basically gone. I still long for a night cap of frozen Pom. Pomegranate that is, it's a tasty tart. Who knew something frozen could warm the heart.  I don't get a chance to visit mojo up north (Phoenix) that often, but I come by when I'm in the area. My favorite is Cookie Monster, it's basically a mojo staple. If you like tart, you can normally find two or three flavors that fit your fancy. I'm a fan of sweet, creamy flavors, top it with coconut flakes and its perfection!  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

You can't come all the way to Tempe Marketplace and skip Mojo, that'd be like going to 2035 in a time machine and not flying a jet pack. You just wouldn't do it, except for maybe if you don't like to fly or are afraid of heights, you wouldn't, but, if you LOVE jetpacks, topped with, say, jet fuel and racing stripes, throw in a fancy push button throttle and electronic ignition, you definitely wouldn't skip it. I'd trade in my space suite for a ride on one of those jet packs. Now if you travel back to the future to prevent Biff from getting his hands on the sports almanac in order to prevent him from taking over the Mojo's of the world, cause where we're going, you don't need roads, and eventually end up riding a steam powered train to get home for dinner, then you know exactly what I'm talking about.  Unfortunately, what Mojo lacks in the way of Jetpacks and racing stripes, they make up for in froyo and delicious toppings. If you end up here on a Tuesday, be sure to check out their facebook page for their word of the day, say the word and get yourself half off your entire order of frozen, delicious yogurt. You could end up walking out with the tallest friggen cup of yogurt, for say, about, half the price. That's only 25% of what you would have paid if you came here on a Monday and filled up your cup with twice as much yogurt. Do the math, I promise its better than Monday's.  My favorite is always cookie monster, but during the holiday season its usually replaced with apple pie, eggnog, peppermint, or something of the likes, and baby I likes. Top mine off with coconut flakes and at 30(ish) calories an ounce you can feel good about your frozen treat, you'll need to forgo the candies, chocolate sauces, and gummie worms to stay down towards the 30/oz mark though ;-)  As always, happy Yelping - see you in 2035 on my jetpack!

This cake kicks other cake's @$$es, now queue the Rocky Theme Song!  Day after day, driving from bakery to bakery, looking for the perfect cake to present at the wife and my 30th birthday extravaganza. It was tedious work, but somebody had to do it. I felt a bit like Rocky Balboa, climbing up and down the endless flight of stairs and beating up on that hanging slab of meat. Except my stairs and cow was a fork and cake; plate to mouth lift, plate to mouth lift. You can work up a sweat just thinking about it.  It's wasn't easy choosing a bakery for that top notch cake. Chocolate cake, vanilla cake, marbled, and layered, filled with strawberry jam, raspberry ganache, topped with butter cream, cream cheese icing, fondant, rum infused; it's enough to make your head spin. I had to sacrifice and dedicate the countless hours of time to complete this task; but in the end, I got it done.  Good, bad, and indifferent, we made it through the first 5 or 6 opponents and ultimately found ourselves pitted against Kick Ass Kakes. Jay started throwing punches, left hook, right hook, upper cut, KO; I didn't think Rocky was ever KO'd in the movies, but maybe it was just a sugar coma - I'll go with that.  Jay got behind our crazy idea for a Hot Dog shaped cake; we 'were' catering Short Leash Hot Dogs after all and wanted a fun cake to go along!  Most other bakers we met with explained 'how difficult of a job it would be', how it would be 'better as a regular cake with hot dogs designed onto it', or lets 'craft little hot dogs and place them around the cake' instead. Jay was the only baker we met with who had the confidence to actually pull off what we were looking to do, and he did not disappoint!  You can check out the picture of our cake if you're interested; *view at your own risk* you might just get K.O.'d from looking at it. Ours is the cake that looks like a big hot dog! ;-)  Jay battered us silly with an awesome red velvet cake, filled with a perfect cream cheese icing, topped with fondant, and shaped to look like a Short Leash Hot Dog. It was a hit, everyone was knocked out with amazement at how cool the cake looked. This was the perfect center piece to our catered celebration!  Thanks again K.A.K's! You can bet we'll be around again for some of those cupcakes and macaroons you bake up daily, just let us recuperate a little before our next prized fight.

Mad love for Mojo, lots of people I talk to are on the fence about them though. For my money, I think Mojo is where it's at, and I've been around the FroYo block. I'm up here at least once per week usually and it's always clean and kept up extremely well. Although it is the buy one get one free check in offer (with the yelp app on a smartphone) that keeps me coming time and time again.  I would likely still come by if it weren't for the check in offer, just not quite as frequently. The staff are always friendly.  They've always got one or two changing flavors, and there are 4 or 5 staples that seem to remain every week. The chocolate flavor leaves something to be desired, but everything else is good. My favorite is the cookie monster (aka cookies n creme) which has been available week after week since I started visiting.  If you're a fan of tart they have a few to choose from and they always have at least one or two non dairy (fruit only) flavors like pineapple or tropical. I tend to mix it up and put a little of just about every flavor into my cup.   Catch a movie across the street, take a stroll through the Biltmore Courtyard, or sit and people watch as you enjoy your frozen delight. You can't go wrong with Mojo!

A shining oasis in the hot Phoenix sun!  Six long days trekking through the Sonoran Desert, with a crushed will to go on, torn and battered from limb to limb, and only a few drops or warm water left in my canteen. Suddenly, on the horizon I see a shining, life giving, shaded oasis of food and drink; if only I can stretch on just a bit further. This is the feeling you get when sitting in your car on a hot Phoenix day.  Skip the heat and aim for Mojo Yogurt!  Outfitted with 5, two flavor machines churning out perfect consistency yogurt, Mojo is one of my favorite stops. The buy one get one yelp check in deal aint bad either, which means I get to bring my favorite gal along with me! They've always got a few rotating flavors, and always have at least one or two non-dairy fruit only choices for the lactos free crowd or if you're just feeling a bit fuity that day.   I like to mix and match my cup with four or five different flavors, sort of like a neopolitan yogurt. Some people like to go all in with one flavor. Gussy up your dessert with some of their fresh toppings like Strawberries, Kiwi, dark chocolate chips, peanut butter cups, mochi, and more. You'll be able to mix up one awesome personalized creation.  Catch a movie across the street, take a stroll through the Biltmore Courtyard, or sit and people watch as you enjoy your frozen delight. If you love froyo as much as I do, you will guaranteed enjoy your trip to Mojo.  Cheers to all your Yelping tastebuds!

Gallo is one of those trendy places to take your date to on a friday night; although I personally was here for luch. We stuck to the tacos, since thats really what I hear all the good things about from them and they did not dissapoint. A bit on the pricey side $3 for a 2 - 3 bite sized taco, if you come on tuesdays I hear they have an all day happy hour.   The food was great so I didn't feel too bad spending $25+ on 5 tacos, chips n salsa, and a couple of soft drinks for 2 people. The service was neither amazing nor terrible. I will probably end up here from time to time on tuesdays to get the most ! for my $.

There is a little known fact that only very little people know, kids mostly, and I guess other people who like yogurt, but if you're bigger than little, I just won't count you. Yogurtland is the bees knees, and now that I let the cat out of the bag, everyone's gonna wanna go to Yogurtland. I should have just kept my mouth shut. :-/  While Yogurtland isn't exactly my normal stop for yogurt, I just can't be 'in the area' without a quick stop in, they're definitely my favorite, best tasting froyo around the Phoenix area. I think my favorite here is peanut butter, but it's rare to see that flavor. There's generally always a new and different flavor and no one around here asks questions when you need to 'sample' all the flavors to land on the one you want to fill your cup with. :-)  If you thought the little known fact was that Yogurtland is the best in town, you'd only be half right, check out studentinsider (*) com and you'll find a discount for not just yogurtland, but also a handful of different spots around the Tempe area. Just pop it open on your mobile phone and bam, you're in business.   Happy Yelping Phoenix. Go eat some froyo!

It's not every day I whip out a review on a gas station, but this spot is super convenient for a fill up when returning your rental car if you're coming from north or west of the airport.   Located on McDowell and about 15th street, they're usually a good 5 - 10 cents cheaper per gallon than most other spots, and you can fill up, pop on the 51 south which turns into 10 east after about 100 yards, exit the rental return exit a quarter of a mile later. I've never been in the convenience store itself, nor do I plan to, I just swipe my card, re-fuel and away I go. Sure, it's in a questionable locale, and the local homeless might come up and ask for some change, but you're in and out in a couple of minutes and on your way to return your rental.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Smeeks is a cool little candy and nick-nack shop in The Union at Biltmore.  We ended up here looking for random gifts to hand out, and left with a couple boxes of assorted taffy. The shop, like all others at The Union is rather small, just large enough to fit 5 or 6 customers. They've got limited space to work with, but fill it with some really great, fun, and throwback candy selections. I wanted to play with half the stuff in the shop, but my wallet didn't want to go home with anything else this particular day.   The adults will all come running, after you stop in for candies, treats, and sweets; they've got some goodies you don't normally see most anywhere else. (Insert your own crude joke about a dark van, random middle aged adults grabbing after your taffy, and/or walking dogs here). I'm scared if I write one myself, I might just get shunned from the inner circle of humanity. ;-)  Happy Yelping Phoenix - and please, don't go up to random vans with strangers handing out assorted taffy!

During my daily ritual of scouring groupon now deals, I noticed R Salon was offering a $12 men's cut and I just happened to be in the market for a trim. Best yet, they're only a couple miles from my place in CenPho. I've never noticed this place before and legitimately so, they're hidden away behind the Bank Of America on Camelback and 20th street.   After arriving the receptionist had mentioned they would give me the groupon price of $12, that I don't have to pay for the groupon to get it, unfortunately I had already purchased. Sorry about that, I know groupon gets their "cut" off the top which shrinks that $12 down some. I'll know better next time.  You get an A for effort for trying to bribe me with ice cold lemonade, but maybe next time you can use something other than country time. Again, nice effort with offering my wife a coffee while we waited; unfortunately, it was cold. I guess you don't claim to be a coffee shop, so I didn't really expect these frills to begin with. I did also see some boxed wine; which, I imagine is available for customer's also. Again, I commend you for the effort, but if you're going to do something, at least make a concerted effort on providing better quality frills. I think I would have preferred iced water with slices of lemon and lime for flavoring, and hot coffee instead of cold. If you weren't going to heat it up, you could have at least put it over ice and called it an iced coffee ;)  I digress, I wasn't here to try out there barrista services anyway, so back to the main event.   The salon is different than what I expected. I guess I'm just used to the single room 10 chair setup you see at most places. There seemed to be 3 or 4 different rooms with chairs and stations for nails, hair drying, massages, and probably everything you might want from a salon. Which is sort of cool if that's what you're looking for; I imagine this is what most women want when they're looking to be pampered.  I thought it was pretty cool and unique that all the stations were outfitted with metallic diamond plating and a Craftsman Rolling toolbox for their equipment storage (scissors, combs, brushes, etc.). They also have this cool vacuum installed into the wall where they swept the discarded hair into a corner of the room, stepped on a switch which ran the vacuum for a few seconds to collect the clippings. The stations and vacuum are definitely things I've never seen before.The floors and surrounding areas were all seemingly kept clean, which is more than I can say for other places; which I don't plan on returning to.  Rene came and found me after waiting for about 20 minutes, we walked back to his station and briefly spoke about what I was looking for. Pretty basic - a 3 razor on the sides and the back and the top trimmed short and blended in with the sides. Rene spent about 20 - 30 minutes chopping and cutting and I left with one of the better hair cuts I've had from a lot of the shops in the area.  Over all I was happy with the cut I came in for but a bit disappointing with the unexpected frills. Again, not my original intention, but I do feel if you're going to do something, you might as well try to do it right. While the cut normally runs $25 I was out for $15 including the $12 groupon and tip. I'd like to say I will come back, but I'm just too dang thrifty to enjoy spending $25 + tip once every 6 or so weeks for a haircut. I'll likely return if I can catch you on another groupon deal though.

I just bought the most expensive pen in my entire life, but ohh, it hurts so good.  I walked in and to my surprise this wasn't a stationary store selling cards, paper, pencils and pens; they sell pens, period. With stars in my eyes, I saw pens ranging from $25 through thousands of dollars. Wow, OMG, is that made with gold?, what a cool looking pen! were all thoughts that came to me while perusing the selection.  I just had to ask, "What makes a pen thousands of dollars instead of 1's of dollars?" to which the operator of this locally owned and operated shop explained the manufacturing process, varying metals and materials used, and previous ownership all have a part to play. I saw pens just shipped out from the manufacturer to pens made in the 20th century previously owned by a collector or perhaps someone of notable importance.  "I guess some of these are more like an art piece than a writing instrument." I noted to the operator and he replied, "right, some people collect watches, and some people like pens."  I was happy to have visited today and left with a really nice looking and feeling pen for $45. I'll be sure and use this whenever I've got something important to sign my name to. Any one need me to autograph something? a picture, a baseball, the magna carta?  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Total wine is where you want to shop for your adult libations. Most of their beers, wines, and alcohols are priced a good 20% less than just about anywhere else; such as, Bev Mo, your general grocery stores, AJ's, and other liquor stores. It's rare that you find what you're looking for less than you can get it at Total Wine; unless there's a sale, even then the price is usually just a few cents less than TW.   They've got as good or better of a selection than anywhere else around. Just about every wine, champagne, beer, and liquor you might want. They can also do orders for you if they have the ability to order / stock what you're looking for.  If you can swing a car trip just for your drinking pleasures or can plan it for your way home, it's worth coming here to save the extra $.  Now only if there was a yelp check in offer, I'd be able to satisfy my inner cheapskate :)    ...as if it wasn't a great price already.

The farmer in down town, hi ho the derry-o, the farmer in down town.  Every Wednesday evening and Saturday morning downtown Phoenix gets it's very own local marketplace with displays from some of Phoenix best food vendors, farmers, local artists and crafters, and food trucks.   You likely won't find a dog taking a cat or a cat taking a mouse, but you can grab your groceries. From items like eggs, fresh produce, dairy, grass fed beef, fruits, and nuts. Hopefully you can take the cheese before the mouse does.  Stop by one of the many food  and truck vendors for one of the best German chocolate cakes you'll have this side of Germany, coffees and teas, locally canned and pickled veggies, home made pastas, and home grown cheeses. If your hungry order yourself a taco, quesadilla, gourmet hot dog, fruit smoothie, salad, or lumpia.  Don't forget to grab your bar of soap, bottle of lotion, local jewelry, hat, or scarf. If you forgot your purse, don't worry they have those here too; they're hand knit. Check out the glass art and bronze creations on your way out and you'll have spent a good 1 - 2 hours in local heaven.  Don't be like the cheese and end up standing alone. Bring your family and bring your friends, there's usually some sort of entertainment going on from one of the many musicians on their way through Phoenix providing quality listening.  Happy yelping! Who knows, you may just find me eating at one of the numerous venders here or buying a loaf of my favorite home baked blueberry bread.

Lola is one of those solid coffee shops that is a destination from just about anywhere in the valley. They're a nice destination for anyone within a few mile radius; walk, run or ride, they keep a bike rack out front.  Pop over whenever you're in the downtown area for better than the average breakfast, quick coffee or tea break, or evening chill session over the weekends. I enjoyed a solid slice of quiche last weekend; although it would have been out of the park with some spinach or veggie added to the recipe. They've also got a selection of pastries to grab, or omlets to order. The wife ordered an eggwhite omlet that was surprisingly yummy!  Heed this suggestion; skip IHOP, Denny's and Coco's and aim for Lola's at breakfast instead.You'll be glad you did.  Happy Dining!

Visited Cartel a handful of times now for lunch during the week, they're one of the coolest coffee stops in Phoenix. Since they have such limited hours, getting there usually needs to be a planned thing. They've got a solid food menu, try pretty much anything on the menu and you won't be dissapointed. I usualy grab their turkey sandwich and sometimes a pastry of some sort.  Whats up with not being open for breakfast on the weekends? I ended up at Lux on Roosevelt and 3rd ave last weekend after a couple miles bike ride into downtown only to find Cartel was closed. I guess I should have popped open yelp first to find their business hours. :(   Unfortunately for all you weekenders or bar hoppers, you'll have to get your fix at another stop. I'd suggest Lux or Jobot if you're in this general vicinity during their off hours.

It's about time I give this spot their just desserts; seriously, I think I've been in over 20 times now with no review. The owner, hands down, no competition, don't even try, makes the absolute best frozen yogurt in the entire valley, maybe even the country. I've had froyo here, I've had froyo there, I've had froyo just about every where. From east coast, to west coast, this spot simply cannot be beat.  The owner buys plain yogurt from one of the best (in my opinion) distributors of froyo, and there's really only about 3 or 4 to choose from. From there, he lets inspiration take form. You'd better bet that if the girls are out scouting, there's gonna be a think mint and Samoa flavored froyo here. Love orange dreamsicle, pistachio, or fruity pebbles, yep, I've seen those flavors here too, aaaand they were delicious. How about marshmallow cream, or peanut butter, or ghirardelli chocolate, those too. I've seen banana, mint, coconut, strawberry, and so many more. They're always delicious, the best you'll find in town. It's totally worth the drive from Phoenix to tempe, just for that late evening craving, and yes they're open until midnight on the weekends and 11 during the week.  If you live frozen yogurt like I think you do, you're doing yourself a disservice by not driving here, right now. I don't want to hear any excuses, it doesn't matter that you live in Ohio, or Oregon, get on a plane in the morning, rent a car for the day, eat the worlds best froyo, be home in time for work the next day. It's totally worth it!!  Happy yelping Phoenix, if you're looking for me, I'll probably be here! :-)

Main ingredient, oh how your deliciousness overfloweth, and your food ain't bad either!  After getting suckered into a lunch with the guys from work, we flipped a coin and ended up aimed from The Main Ingredient. Let me tell you, there are worse places to end up for lunch. I wasn't sure how, but the coin was flipped between, Main Ingredient, Cartel, AND Upper Crust. I didn't realize there were 3 sides to a coin before, but apparently there is.   I was torn between the Mac & Cheese and the the Red Goat. After some convincing my buddies and the waitress helped me land on the Mac & Cheese. Although, you can't really compare apples to apples here, being that the Red Goat is a salad and the Mac & Cheese is; well, Mac & Cheese, I really was torn. Let me tell you now, this was the beginning of the end for me, and I haven't looked back since. After that first bite I made an executive decision; I would be taking a vacation from my normal diet. Don't worry diet, we'll get back together someday soon, just not today and likely not tomorrow either.  The Mac & Cheese here was like a lasagne of good ol' hometown delicious cheesy goodness, expecting to see a piled scoop of cheesy noodles, I was pleasantly surprised! Cooked with loads of cheddar cheese and topped with green chile, this was pure Mac & Cheese bliss.  In real downtown Phoenix fashion, Main Ingredient is tucked into a renovated home, redone to give that home / cafe feel. Many of their dishes are served with a crispy crusted soft and extremely tasty bread and on a side note, ask them for a side of olive oil for dipping it in. Better for you than butter and in my opinion better tasting, and it adds a little European charm.   Here's hoping your next coin flip ends all you up at Main Ingredient. Happy Dining Yelpers!

My parents taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, then don't say anything at all."  Yelp has taught me, "when you don't have something nice to say, tell it like it is."  Sorry mom and dad, Yelp FTW!  I like my restaurants how I like my style, un-cramped; unfortunately, this place is packed full with wall to wall tables and chairs leaving about 3 inches in between you and the guy at the table next to you. Don't plan to come here during the lunch rush with a big group, you're lucky if you can fit one or two people through the door. The parking isn't that appealing either, you are practically parked in the middle of 16th street traffic. :-/  La Condesa makes a pretty good taco, and their salsa ain't bad either. To their benefit, they do have some fairly unique salsa's to choose from, such as strawberry, peanut, and pecan; but in my opinion, unique doesn't necessarily = awesome. Any of their tacos will do you right, but my favorite is their pork.    In my opinion, and lets face it, if you're reading my review, that's exactly what you're looking for right? La Condesa over stated when they went with Gourmet in the name. Sure, everybody likes their taco's but who wants to pay $9 for two tacos and leave feeling like they were packed in like sardines in the middle of a seedy neighborhood? If it isn't obvious yet, I don't plan on coming back soon, I can take or leave their salsas and tacos and wouldn't be bothered either way.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, hope you find that hidden taco gem you've always been searching for.

Excelent Falafel - check  Great hummus - check Awesome spanakopita - check  **Warning** Beware that veggie doesn't always mean good for you.  While I normally try to skip the cabs, I just couldn't stop stuffing myself with those perfect triangles of warm pita covered with their garlic pepper hummus; it was just the right amount of spice with a more than right amount of awesome!  I don't eat falafel too often, but this was definitely the most interesting and tasty falafel I have had. Cover it with whatever that creamy sauce was and you're in vegan junk food heaven!  If you're wondering how the spanakopita (spinach pie) was, you just can't go wrong with this option. I was plesantly surprised when the spinach didn't taste like you're average cafeteria bitter blah, whatever-ness like I was half expecting. They perfectly topped the spinach with fresh feta - which was some of the better feta I've had in a while. Covered with flaky layers of filo dough and baked til perfection --- mmm its so good.  Olive Tree is super authentic with my only regret being that I didn't try the Gyro, I have a personal goal to find the valley's best gyro and have had one at close to 10 - 14 places thus far. For some reason, on my only visit here I was just feeling vegetarian, go figure. :/  I don't imagine I will be back too soon, since I hail from CenPho and this place is like 15 miles away, but it will definitely be a destination if I'm within a few miles around mealtime!

I really like ghost armor and had them armor my phone in Yelp Red. At least I tell everyone that's what color it is :) I usually am on yelp anyway so it might as well be yelp red.  I personally suggest that if you're thinking about armor, to get it done soon after getting your phone. Saves from gathering scratches, gives a "bit" of a shock absorber and looks super cool to boot - the colored carbon fiber will run you an added $15 (i think) on top of the $20 or so it is for the armor and then another $10 or $15 for them to professionally install your armor.   Ive had 2 phones armored and they once messed up the button on the phone; the pattern didn't on the carbon fiber shell didn't match up to the rest of the phone. I asked them to adjust it and they were happy to fix it.   I wouldn't make an official claim that ghost armor will protect your phone from shattering. #1 because I don't work for them and #2 because its probably not 100% true, but Ive never shattered the glass on my iPhones, nor has my wife, and we've both been through 2 armored iPhones in the past 5 years. Maybe were just careful, wait that's not right, our phones drop once in a while just like everyone else's. Maybe its just lucky placement of the point of impact when the phone hits the ground or maybe its the extra bit of coverage you get from the armor - you decide.

Shaving with razors and changing car tires Shooting with hand guns and building camp fires Changing old light bulbs and light fittings These are a few of those manlier things.  Even to the tune of sound of music, there are few things in life more manly than smoking a good cigar.  The building itself leaves something to be desired, and it's 'not quite' up to a Smoking Jackets required level, but the staff more than makes up for it. Cigar Inn is owned and operated by an extremely nice family of cigar aficionado's. Their daughter behind the counter will put most guys to shame with her mastery of tobacco, but without making you feel like less of a man when doing so. She asked me what I was looking for and I told her I'd like to have something not extremely bold, and easy to smoke. She suggested an Ashton (brand) cigar, which was perfect.   I'll more than likely be back from time to time, I'm looking forward to my next visit!  Happy Yelping Phoenix, go chop some wood, drink a single malt scotch, then come to Cigar Inn.

There is something to be said for having all the right tools and this place has some of them. Match that with an ok cut and you've got yourself a recipe for mediocrity.   I was excited to try out Brooklyn after reading the eleven 5 star reviews. What finally got me in today was a Groupon now deal, get their normal $15 cut for just $10!  The stylist was meticulous to a fault. He spent about 45 minutes on me; during which, he had the chair turned away from the mirror and the final reveal was pretty disappointing. They definitely didn't seem to live up to all the hype. I ended up with an uneven cut; the sides and top of my cut looking more like a box than shaped with my head.   There was no air conditioning; however, a large fan was pointed towards the sitting area. The decor appears to be of Ikea origin, while not really impacting the ability to get a good cut, the place just seems a bit "thrown together". The chairs are kind of small and as such, not really that comfortable; it seemed like the foot rest was too short and did not adjust for length. That's saying something coming from a 5'5'' guy, i couldn't imagine how this would work for someone with longer legs than mine.  All in all, you can get an ok cut, but for my $$ I'll end up at Camelback barber shop in the same shopping center as best buy on Camelback rd just up the street.

Yogurtland is hands down my fave yogurt and there's about four of them around Phoenix. Here - far west in Avondale, and a few in the east - downtown Scottsdale and in Tempe. There's never an icy texture and the flavors are always spot on. Unfortunately for me, I live in Central Phoenix and it's not exactly convenient to just pop on by for a bite. With that said, there's plenty of froyo around to pick from, and I still think it's worth the drive to Yogurtland every once in a while.   They've usually got a special flavor or two; such as Taro (a fun tasting Pacific Islands fruit), Greek Raspberry and Banana, Pumpkin Pie, or Snowflake Mint. With their special flavors changing every few weeks. Their yogurt, in general, isn't too tart and tends to have more of a creamy flavor than other places, which is why I enjoy them over others.  Grab a sample cup, try them all, mix up your favorites, throw in a topping or two, eat and enjoy. If I'm ever in the area; as I was on this day, I always seem to make time for a "little" froyo! ;-)  Happy Yelping Phoenix.

I had a great time at their monthly Clean Comedy night!  Every first Sunday of the month at 7pm, Le Chalet hosts a PG rated clean comedy night safe enough to bring the kiddos along. No cover at the door, but a $5 per person minimum on food or beverage is required.   As we arrived, we were greeted by a delightful gentleman, complete with authentic french accent. This guy must have been practicing it his whole life. The waiter was an energetic, pony tail sporting, ball of electricity and was delighted to call my wife out on her bland choice of pizza crepe and insisted she ordered the mushroom chicken; excelent choice sir!   We had a great time listening to the comics come up to the "bat cave" like stage in their back room to quote one of the comics, and with 50% of them hitting home a humorous set it was like "batting 500, and that's a win" to quote another.  We both loved the food, I had one of their delicious sandwiches and the wife couldnt stop eating her savory crepe. I normally keep my dining and entertainment limited to downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale, but this food was good enough to come back for.   Here's to you clean comedy, stay funny Phoenix and happy Yelping! ;-)

So many samples and so little time. With the event happening just over a mile from our place, we decided to walk to and fro. Overall, I'm glad we did, but was regretting it the moment we had to waddle our way home.   It's not every day you get to eat yourself silly; only on Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, and at Devoured. What seemed to be an endless supply of beer, wine, and great food, turned into tomorrow's 'regrets'.  Regret that I ran out of space in my stomach with the ambition to sample everything, regret that I only got tickets for one day, regret that I'll be at the gym for a month working off one day of caution thrown to the wind, and regret that I have to wait an entire year to do it all over again.  Pork taco's, venison steak atop polenta, hand made ice cream, bacon meat balls, blue berry fritters, hamburger bites, macaroni and cheese, saffron ice pops, churros, pretzels, deep fried deviled eggs, milk shakes, root beer floats, duck salad, home made dulce de lece twix bars, chocolate strawberries, brownies, cookies, bruschetta, salads, goat tacos, goat cheese, goat milk, short rib ravioli, meat loaf bites, and on, and on, and on, and on.   After getting sufficiently stuffed, we took a quick tour of the Phoenix Art museum; an awesome spot for an event by the way, then we rolled our way home. Not really thinking this one completely through ahead of time, the walk home took an added 25 minutes, thanks to the 'brisk' pace we were able to keep. I certainly wish we had driven now :-/  Until next time devoured, you won this battle, but I will certainly win the war.  Happy yelping Phoenix! :-)

A solid choice for any froyo lover; but I find it hard to visit with Mojo only 2 blocks away. I just can't stay away from mojo with their b1g1 free yelp check in, which shows from my huge (# of check-ins there). Otherwise, their yogurt is tasty and the toppings are fresh.

Seems to be a cumulative collection of all things that don't really sell from the normal jc penny stores. You can come across useful stuff here and there. Most items here are cheaper than normal retail by at least 25% and upwards of 75%, which is good for those who are on a budget or just spend thrifts.   Today I ran across a sale on sneakers. Adidas; my faves, were among them. I picked up 2 pairs at $20 each. I would normally spend $40 on these same shoes from nordstrom's rack. Score!  I looked through some of their clothes and nothing stuck out to me. They've got a decent selection of towels, curtains, and other household items.  Over all, this should be on your list of stops for all you thrifty shoppers. Plan to stop in at the Dillard's clearance center at fiesta mall if your coming from Phoenix or the west valley and get the most shopping for your few gallons worth of fuel.

I've visited Athens a handful of times in my search for the best Gyro around the Phoenix area. While Athen's doesn't take top billing in my book, they come in at a close second or third.   They make a mean gyro and you can't hardly beat the $3.50 price tag. For just two extra bucks order it with extra meat and you'll walk out for about $6 with an over filled belly! In case you're wondering - they DON'T serve those crummy gyro pre-packaged pieces. This gets shaved right from the cone.  The pita is good and they could stand to change up the tatziki sauce a bit - it's a little on the runny side. Definitely a sound choice if you're close by and feeling a good quality Gyro.

Since I discovered shortleash's gormet spin on the dreary old dog, I have dreams of coming back time and time again. Pick from one of the solid regular menu options, try and experiment by making your own custom dog, or mix it up by adding toppings to one of their menu choices. Choose your dog, such as bratwurst, spicey beer hot (my personal fav), a regular dog, veggie dog, etc. Choose from toppings like Fried pickles, cole slaw, pinto beans, cheddar cheese, chipotle cream cheese, fried onions, sauerkraut, mango chutney, sliced jalenpenos, and so much more, all of which seem to be fresh and extremely tasty. Wrap it all up in an indian naan flat bread. This is the stuff of legends.  I think I read somewhere that this weeks feature of the week comes with bacon - I think I know what I'll be eating for lunch today. I almost always make my dog custom. Sometimes I will change pace with the featured dog of the week, which are usually a little different and exciting.   Check them on facebook or their website for their weekly schedule, they usually hang around down town for lunches through the week and dinner on select days.  ... I think "food truck friday" at the phoenix public market should be re-named to "shortleashdogs and the food trucks" - expect a 20 minute wait in line to make your order if you show up around 12pm on friday for lunch. I promise it's worth the wait!  Quoted in the weekly Yelp newsletter 7-4-2012: http://www.yelp.com/weekly?editorial_id=L5AQHJ8yFfPtBRNI_xIRyA

The Ultimate Phoenix Downtown Destination!  On a day where it's 106 degrees in the shade, 30+ people standing in line can't be wrong. If there's this many people willing to risk 2nd degree burns from the scortching sun waiting in line for their turn to order up a hotdog, there really must be something to it. No where else in Phoenix will you find people this dedicated. I just couldn't help myself; I was drawn to get in line with everyone else.  Brimming with excitement from all the possibilities, the wait in line seems miniscule compared to the payout I am about to receive from such an amazing dog! Will I get a Mokie and add fried pickles? Will I order a Lady and top it off with green chilies and pinto beans? How about the Oliver and throw in some of that tasty coleslaw? Wait, no, I'll have the Bear, naked style. Maybe instead of the Bear, I'll get a corn dog, with some of that awesome chipotle cream cheese. The possibilities are endless - I guess I'll just have to keep coming back until I've had them all!  Oh no!! after getting closer to the front of the line, I found out they've even got a featured dog of the week with customized specialty toppings and this week it's Beef and Bean Chili topped with Fritos and Cheddar! What will I choose?!?!?  A quick visit to Food Truck Fridays in downtown Phoenix (McKinley and Central) between 11am and 1:30pm will prove there's Short Leash, and then there's everyone else. Don't make the mistake and get stuck ordering from "everywhere else."  Happy Yelping Phoenix and go grab one of these awesome dogs!

Ode to Short Leash.  I once heard a whisper of a much beloved hot dog; of island dreams come alive atop a six inch bun. I dared not believe there could be another to even compare against my precious.   I feel as a guilty lover drifted away from his one true love in a moment of weakened convictions. The hot peppers and spicy caribbean sauce left me breathless and weak in the knees. As a guilty lover always does, he comes crawling back from rediscovery of what he once knew to be true. Short Leash's love is ever lasting, and how dare I even consider another.   I have faith in our bond; Short Leash, and our ties are not easily broken. I regret even the consideration that there could be another out there to quench the lunchtime desires for hot dog delights. I promise I shall not stray again, with a conviction of the strength of stone.  From hence forth, I promise to remain faithful to the lovingly topped gourmet hot dogs. Available with sauerkraut, cole slaw, pepperoncini's, jalapeños, mango chutney, pinto beans, cheddar cheese, chipotle cream cheese, diced tomatoes, fried pickles, grilled onions, peanut butter, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, blue cheese, green chilis, smoked gouda, relish, bacon and barbeque sauce.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, don't stray far from your one true love.

You want to know what happens when you repress your inner humor; you end up with a place like this!  I ran into a guy the other day while shopping at L*st Ch*nce (per our legal agreement, I'm not allowed to say their real name). He walked by and I swore I knew him from somewhere. There was just something about that beard, that short stature, and those big hairy feet. I just couldn't quite put my finger on it. That's it! I remember now! This was Frodo from Lord of the Rings! Wait; hold on, just a second, no that's not right, hobbits didn't have a beard. This must be Gimli! I knew it, I just knew it, this is awesome, the real life John Rhys-Davies, right here in front of me at L*st Ch*nce. Actually..., I don't think that's right either. Why would Gimli be shopping here? Besides, the feet didn't quite match. No, this was someone completely different, but who?  Ah ha, finally, it was Nick, NICK!, the MC for Wednesday's 8pm open mic nights at Stand-up, Scottsdale!. I knew I had seen him somewhere, I just have to get his autograph. "Hey you do stand-up comedy at C*pper  Bl*es, don't you?" to which he replied "Ya, I've been there a few times. I'm usually at Stand-up Scottsdale! though." Friggin C*pper Bl*es, so stupid of me. How did I confuse these two? Then he had the audacity to invite me out to see his Wednesday show. 8pm, 8PM, I'll say it again EIGHT PM! Nothing good EVER happens on a Wednesday night at 8 PM. :-/ "Ya, that sounds fun!," I can't believe I just said that, now I sort of feel obligated. What the heck did I get myself into?! Me and my big mouth.  How often do you get personally invited out by some random dude you just met for the first time, but have seen once or twice before? It's not every day if you're wondering, at least for guys. In fact, this may have been my first time; so please, be gentle. 8 pm. ugh... At least they have $2 beers, $3 wells, and $4 food to keep me company while I mercy laugh my way through the night.  Now on to the show; please, 8pm can't come, and go, fast enough. Just serve me my $4 nachos (burger, or loaded fries), $3 whiskey and coke and start the thing already. The sooner this show starts, the sooner I can get home and have fulfilled my obligation to Nick's 'personal invitation', I don't even want to be here.   Boy was I wrong, something good does in fact happen on a Wednesday night, and it all happens right here at Stand-up Scottsdale! There were well over 20 comics presenting that night, with a handful of local comics, mixed in with some national touring comics, and a special pop in by Thai Rivera. I sure am glad I got pulled out for a night of live comedy at one of the coolest clubs in town. Forget the daily work out, you will get one right here. You're gonna laugh your butt off cause this place is sure to tickle your funny bone!  Now Howard, I know you said not to post **** online. I just couldn't help myself. My inner Yelper was banging to get out!  You know I'll be back again soon, and I promise that next time, I'll try to keep the heckling to a minimum.

Ive been round here 3 or 4 times in the past year. I generally live and work around downtown so I wouldn't really consider myself a regular - somehow I have been elevated to the rank of Duke of Yumberi after just 3 check-ins.   Challenge: You yelpers really need to step up your game!  Ive decided that mint frozen yogurt just is not good... and it's not just here, it always seems to have an odd after taste. Otherwise, every other flavor I've tried seems to be a solid choice. You've got to get the person behind the counter to help you with your samples, which is a bummer, cause I don't really like feeling like I'm not free to sample every flavor to find if I want to have them all or just one or two. You just really don't know if that banana will taste like banana or (insert your explitive here); not that i've seen a banana flavor here.  The place seems fairyly well kept up; doesn't seem to be dirty or slimy anywhere, which is a huge plus for any fro-yo place. You can sometimes grab a groupon now coupon ($5 for $8) and discount your order. Come during happy hour (5-6pm mon-fri)and get a buy one get one free order; which helps if you're bringing your favortie gal along. All in all, it's a sound decision for anyone craving froyo in the pardise valley mall area.

CityScape - oh how you haunt my dreams.  I was genuinely scared the first time I tried to exit your parking structure. Having to go uphill at practically 90 degrees and pray no one is trying to walk in front of you as you arrive at the top of the ramp was like playing russian roulette with other peoples lives. After a few trips, the anticipation and build up of riding up the exit ramp has worn off, but the thought of pedestrians in limbo still comes to mind.   Over on the north east end on street level you've got yogurtini and the new fuego cityscape nestled next to each other. And in the central east corridor 1 level up you've got Gold's Gym and Tilted Kilt. Walk across the street or take the walking bridge between the two area's and surrounding the fountain go back up more stairs and enter into Stand Up Live or Copper blues. Back to the east side street level on the other side of the big stairway you can find arrogant butcher.  If you find yourself on the Washington side of the center at street level in the west building, you can find, wait sorry, its the west side of the building and you can find five guys burgers.   If you haven't quite picked up on this, the shops all seem to be disconnected in a peculiar sort of way. Most shops are of good to high quality and they will all validate 3 hr parking in the garage below the center. If you end up here on an "event" night, just tell the attendant that you're shopping and get validated at your restaurant or shop destination. Don't let them try to convince you that everyone is supposed to pay $10 - you can still grab a ticket from the machine and have it stamped. I'm not about to spend $10 to park in order to spend $6 on froyo at yogurtini.   Recently, Ive been biking my way down here and there's spots to lock your bike up all around the center, near most shops on the outside of the center or atop the the stairs / elevators aimed into the dreaded garage. I have personally tried to pass as a pedestrian in front of the garage exit on my bike and walking on a few occasions and some of the cars either simply don't see you, aren't looking, or simply couldn't care less about the value of human life. CityScape - please do something cause that exit is dangerous. I'm surprised that no one has been hit yet - or maybe they have and we just haven't heard about it yet.   After a review like that, you wonder how on earth they deserve 4 stars. Well I really like venturing to downtown Phoenix and CityScape is usually my destination because the collective cool of the combined shops and restaurants outweighs the fatal flaws of the design of this structure. Good luck to anyone trying to walk or ride a bike along Washington in front of that exit ramp and watch out for cars, because they generally aren't watching out for you.  Happy shopping and don't forget to wear your helmet and body armor!

The wife and I have been here enough times for me to write a real review of Bliss, and ReBAR for that matter. I've been for breakfast, for lunch, for dinner, for drinks. I've been on a Monday, a Tuesday, probably a Friday or two, likely Saturday and definitely a Sunday. Heck, lets just throw in Wednesday and Thursday for good measure.  It's the type of neighborhood bar where every one knows your name, as long as you happen to know everybody who's there that is. One of the best Macaroni and Cheeses in town - the best? perhaps, you should judge them on that one for yourself. The wait staff is always friendly, the drinks are poured 'well' ;-), the food always comes out tasty, and the friends are always here. What else could you really need?  I wouldn't exactly call this a dance venue, but there's generally always dance music playing in the bar and on the patio over the weekends; I've seen some people get down. They've got a cool patio for brunch when it's nice outside, an interesting outdoor bar with heat lamps for those chilled "winter" evenings, and indoor dining in the bar as well as the restaurant.  FYI, this is a gay bar (not that there's anything wrong with that), so if you're looking to pickup on the opposite sex, you might have some trouble with that here, but it's a great spot for gathering with your friends.  Happy Yelping Phoenix! :-)

Oh what a night! Took my date here back on June 13. It was a very special time for me, as I remember what a night.  The lady and I came in on a Wednesday evening and were promptly greeted by the hostess. She asked if we'd like to be seated at a table or in their piano bar; it was open seating. Delighted to hear that we could enjoy our dinner with a little live piano, I opted to check out the bar.   Oh I, got a funny feeling when we walked in the room. And I, as I recall it ended much too soon. Miffed at having to wait 15 minutes now with no waiter stopping by, we went back to the hostess and asked if we could sit somewhere that had actual wait staff to take our orders. After a quick and sincere apology from the hostess and who I believe to have been the manager, they said they would seat us with their best waitress! They too seemed; or at least acted, genuinely concerned that we had to wait so long.   Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me. She was everything I dreamed she'd be. Within moments of being seated; for real this time, our waitress had our drink orders and was describing the specials of the day.  We ordered up a bowl of (so-so) chicken tortilla soup.Then went on to a (super fantastic) artichoke / goat cheese flat bread!  The Summer Vegetarian Tasting Salad was out-a-sight, it came with one an awesome tasting taco and it was all veggie! The wife loved the chili relleno, and I found the cedar roasted tofu with mango chutney to be top notch. The "grains of life" as they are listed on the menu was one of the better versions of quinoa I've been served in the valley; light refreshing and one of the best protein sources you can find in the veggie kingdom.  Along with our vegetarian sampler, we shared an order of Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin; and oh was it tender. Served up with an amazing creamy herb polenta and one or two other vegetables, this meal was 100% delish.  Oh what a night, this meal was turning out to be. Sweet Surrender, what a night! They served me up a few of those Mini Indulgence Desserts. "Yes, I'll have two desserts." Why not, they're only a couple bucks!  Thanks seasons 52 for turning around an unimpressive start and taking care of what could have been an ugly experience, you guys certainly saved the evening!  I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder, Straining my head around and taking my body under. O what a night! After a meal like this I'll be singing that famous Four Seasons song for a days to come. OH what a night! Doo dit doo dit dit, doo dit doo dit dit. Oh what a night!...

If you find yourself wandering the streets of down town phoenix late one evening, no, you're probably not homeless you were likely just hopping from bar to bar and can't remember.   Don't fret because JoBot's lights are still on late into the night. While I can't say exactly just how late "late" is because I haven't payed too close attention to that minor detail and no one has posted it here on yelp yet. I can say they've been open every time I have visited after 11pm.  Mental note to self, next time at JoBot find out about hours and update yelp. Is it considered a mental note if I just wrote it down? I'm also not so sure it was to self either as I plan to post this review sometime soon.   Anyway.  Give any of their crepes a try, they're all fairly good; although, I do prefer the savory crepes over the sweet crepes here. I truly can't believe I just said that actually, since most of my other reviews are for frozen yogurt and cupcakes, at least that's what I tried to order and was told "We don't actually serve frozen yogurt here sir. Would you like to try our crepes?"  Loved the chorizo and egg crepe - twas the perfect combination of everything they combined together to make the crepe. I'm pretty sure it was part chorizo, part egg, part cheese and part crepe. But then again it was a late night and I did just swing by after visiting Lost Leaf next door.  I hear they serve excellent coffee too, but I tend to stick to tea and pastries. Happy wandering my yelping friends! Hope to stumble into you sometime while chowing down on one of their tasty crepes.

These pastries are not to be trifled with, no comparison comes to mind. I've been to plenty of places, but amazing apple's hard to find. You can quote me, if you'd like. I'd suggest you take a hike, To Manon, a destination to unwind!  Manon came highly suggested for a sampling of their $1.10 French macarons, of course I couldn't pass that up, especially since I was just a half mile away. I took a quick look through their displays and discovered they had some pastries with apple, and some filled with crème, a few with raspberries, and chocolate too. If there is a dessert filled with Apple, you can rest assured I'm going to order it, and Manon had two. I chose to the French apple tart this time, I'll save the other for my next time through. It's not often that a pastry makes you blush, but this French apple tart sure did ;-)  The macarons were amazing, but the surprise winner here was the raspberry gourmandise. Rest assured I'll be back for that one when I visit again. If you've not been to Manon yet, I would strongly urge you to check your reservations and come by for some of the best pastries I've ever had.  Happy Yelping!

Looking for a blast from the past, or at least want to dress like one? You've found the right place!  Antique Sugar is nestled inside another antique / furniture store. All of their clothes are vintage, which is a fancy word for "awesome from about 30 or 40 years ago". While nothing in here was exactly what I was looking for, i know where to shop now for those bell bottoms, purple tuxedo tops, or orange striped pants if I ever need one.   Prices here don't compare to thrift stores, so expect to pay about 50 - 80% of equivalent retail prices. $10 - 20 for shirts, $50 - 75 for suits / jackets, etc.  Happy Shopping my friends!

Finally decided to try out Fuego tacos and was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.... that I didn't come sooner.   First I have to say that Matt (our waiter) was awesome. Attentive, nice, accommodating, and friendly. I say this because it is just about opposite of my experience everywhere else I go. I just assumed that it's normal for your waiter to be snarky and ignore their customers. He seems to prove that theory wrong. I'm usually cheap and give out only a 10-12% tip for the usual lack of service I receive, but Matt earned the full 20.  Awesome just doesn't come close to describing the meal. It started with the salsa and chips and kept going all the way through dessert. I know it's usually chips an salsa, but the real star there is the salsa, so you have to say it first. Ordered a carne asada quesadilla, which came dressed with a chipotle dipping sauce, the quesadilla was great by itself and extreme when complimented with the chipotle dip. Wife and I shared both the pernil (pork) and shirt rib barbacoa (beef) tacos, either way you choose it, it's a great dish. Although I did like the short rib tacos slightly better than the pork. The tacos come with sides of both rice and black beans. I've made black beans before, and they don't even compare. Like trying to compare a huffy bicycle to a Ducati motorcycle - they just don't. Our meal was followed up with a slice of cake covered with a mango and pineapple reduction. I will definitely be back sooner rather than later.  Expect to pay about $12 - $14 per plate after tax / tip, a few more if you order drinks, apps, and / or dessert.  If you've read any of my other reviews, you might just know that I'm driven by good food with a great value, and as such. You can find usually grab a deal on (choose one) $5for$10 on yelp / groupon, or $25off$35 from restaurant-com; yes I did use a deal for myself. While normally you can feel the glares of the wait staff whenever you pull out your coupon, Matt made us feel like it was no big thing and was happy to serve us!   I had such a good experience, that I might even consider **gasp** coming without a coupon **/gasp*

Being wasteful has never been so rewarding.  Had I not been wasting time at the mall before a show just down the road, I may have never decided to check this place out. Today, I was introduced to shaving oil - not cream, oil. Use this oil pre-shave and you'll be spared from those annoying red spots, ingrown hairs, bumps, and cuts. No more blotting patches of toilet paper on your neck before your day at the office. For all you electric shavers out there, they've got you covered too with a separate line of products.  Ten minutes in this store has turned me into a believer. Now I want to have the entire line of oil, lotions, and after shaves available from The Art of Shaving. The salesman was polite and answered most of my questions about their products. I sure am glad I decided to let him demonstrate their product, I doubt I would even have considered trying them out otherwise.  Unprepared to spend the $25 per product at the time, he handed me a few samples to try out after I got home. I do have to say that after giving them a go for myself, I'm definitely hooked. Now I'm saving all my nickels and dimes until I can scrape enough of them together to get the complete shaving set which includes the pre-shave oil, the shaving cream, the after shave lotion, and a new shaving brush.   If you've not tried them before, swing by, get yourself a demonstration, ask for a sample pack, try it out for yourself and you'll be hooked like I am.  Happy Yelping Phoenix - It's time to look like a well groomed man!

Oh Breakfast Club, my favorite social group, just what would we do without you? I for one would probably eat a lot less breakfast, and I wouldn't have such awesome people to hang with, that's for sure.  The long trek ensued from my humble abode in Cenpho, Monica, I hope you know I don't travel this far for just anyone. Finally landing on the huevos rancheros, my taste buds were excited to dig in. The cilantro jalepeno sauce was delicious with a good mixture of spice and flavor, it was tasty.  With a decent sized group of 12 or so, the staff were able to accommodate us without many hiccups at all. We all chatted, got to know each other more, hung out, and had a great time. Be sure to try this place out soon!  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I finally figured out why I've never been here before. Mostly because it's a jewelry store, and lets face it, I just don't wear jewelry.  My wife and I walked in trying to escape the Phoenix sun while burning some time. Sorry to disappoint, the actual sun, not Steve Nash, Grant Hill, or Shannon Brown. If that were the case, this would be a completely different review and likely not for Charming Charlie.  During our quick escape from the scorching heat, I was surprised to find decent quality items at reasonable prices. Most bracelets, ear rings, and necklaces were somewhere between $10 and $15 per item. The other cool thing I noticed was the the entire place was color coordinated. Need something green, no problem - it's right over here. Something red, sure - right over there. Black, blue, purple, etc. Finding something to match that dress or pair of shoes seems to be a snap in here.  They also had a small selection of shoes, dresses, bags, hats, and other accessories. It sort of reminds me of Claires; that pre through teen aged girl's accessory shop you usually find in just about every mall, just for more adult tastes and styles.   I wouldn't exactly come here looking for diamonds or gold, but who knows, you might just find that golden colored bracelet to match those shoes you've got waiting to be worn.  Happy shopping Yelpers, and keep your eyes peeled for those Phoenix Suns - they're dangerous!

I'm glad I ran into this place, I love the no nonsense approach to chiropractic here. I am already a fan of chiropractic, but have no real back, nerve, or spine issues of note; however, sometimes you just need to get adjusted to keep everything in alignment. Their monthly subscription is perfect for people who want to commit to a monthly arrangement, you can also pay per visit or you can pre-purchase 'X' number of visits for discounted rates.  I woke up with a pinched nerve one day recently, I visited on my lunch break and the immediate pain was taken care, followed up with an adjustment two days later and today I'm back to my normal self!  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

Loved the pizza here. I first tried their food at the Yelp pleY date event and it was delishious! Their meatball, ravioli, mozzerella cheese sampler at the event was awesome. I just had to come and check them out.  The pizza is not quite what I would call a thin crust, but the dough is not too thick either. I may just be trying to convince myself that pizza is good for you here, but does thinner crust = less carbs? I think so, and thats what I'm going with at least.   All their pizza's come topped with their home made mozzerella, and I finished mine off with meatballs, which seemed like a good idea at the time.   I was right! The meatball pizza is nothing less than super. They seem to have different daily specials. Swing by on a Tuesday for buy one get one free pizzas and bring home some 'za for tha family.

Come here (any night of the week) if you're looking for live music and prefer a cool jazz tune.  After a rained out evening outdoor concert, a few of us decided we weren't ready to give up on an hearing some live music. We popped into a place around the corner hoping to find some live Jazz, and disappointed with who was playing that evening, we asked the bartender if there was somewhere else they would suggest for Jazz on a Sunday evening.  I'm glad we decided to take his advice on Eddie V's, cause I had one of the best evenings of great live Jazz in the Phoenix area sitting right at the bar. After some encouragement by our group, the musicians decided to really lay into it with their music and turn it up from the typical elevator music to something you could really dance along to.   The bartender poured some excellent tasting drinks, the band ended up chatting with us for a couple minutes post set and it turned out to be a fabulous way to spend four hours with your gal.  Happy Yelping Phoenix! :-)

O Frenchy's; Love that spicy sauce!  At the behest of a trusted source of hot dog deliciousness, I was convinced to give Frenchy's a shot at the title of 'worlds best dog'.  I really enjoyed the spicy sauce that makes his Caribbean Dogs worthy of competition for a top billed dog. Frenchy is a great guy and was a pleasure to chat with, he'll brighten up your day with just a few short minutes at his cart! If you're bold and don't mind a kick to your taste buds every once in a while, tell him you want it spicy and he'll kick it up with that awesomely hot, peppery concoction.  While I can't say I loved this hot dog, it definitely is one of my top picks, just behind number one. Over all, my lunch was spicilly delicious and I ended up with the hiccups to prove it.  That caribbean sauce, IMO, is good enough to bottle and sell - I'd definitely buy a bottle or two. Lunch behind the AZ republic building on 2nd street and taylor is all the better because of Frenchy and his fine caribbean flavors.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

A great value for a clean car; this is a no frills place.  There's no  line of people waiting to clean, wax, and polish your car; as such, no one trying to up sell you a new wind shield or $100 detailing service. The employees simply ask what you would like and send you on through the wash.   **Note, if you have an older vehicle with a metal antenna, be sure to detach it before entering the wash.**  I used to get the $2 wash until I decided to step up to the $5 wash last week. I was plesantly surprised when I saw my wheels were clean when I bent down to wipe them off - this you don't get with the $2 wash.   They have free vacuum stations for all their customers. If your willing to spend a few extra min doing the vacuuming and wiping down your dash yourself, you get just as good of a wash or better than the full service car washes that you spend $20 on.  Theres usually no (or a very short) line of people waiting to wash their car. In general, you're in and out within 15 - 20 minutes.

Great little fro-yo shop, its worth a try. If you're a fan of tart flavors, it seems that every option here has a little tart in it. I would even claim that it is one of the best tarts that I have had in the greater phoenix area. While I can't say it IS the best, since there are what seems to be hundreds of fro-yo shops around the valley, Ive been to most of them in the CenPho, NoPho and Tempe (near mill ave) area, as well as a few in and around scottsdale downtown and north scottsdale.  I came by because of a coupon I found in the New Times magazine for a buy one get one free, I always love a two-fer. Makes it easier to bring along your favorite gal (or guy). I saw the coupon in the last few months (Feb/March/April) editions.  If you're not a fan of tart, id swing by mojo yogurt just down the block from here. Mojo is a solid choice for fro-yo also.

This is the place where the beer flows like wine.  Sorry Lloyd and Harry, you should skip past Aspen and head here. With what looked to be 40+ beers to choose from on tap, grab yourself a cold and frothy one on a moments notice. Order yourself some of their Rockin' Chicken Nacho's, a fig and goat cheese pizza, the southwest burger topped with roasted green chiles and Monterrey Jack cheese, or what can only be described as "Pig" on their menu. A 1/2 lb of bacon served with a side of dipping maple syrup.   I've been twice now on a Tuesday for their Open Mic' comedy line up "Laughs and Draughts". $3 Santan brews, $6 Chicken and Mac n Cheese, and other nice priced bar foods to choose from like wings. As much as I want to love this local joint for a mid-week night of comedic stylings; unfortunately, I don't think I'll be spending too many more Tuesday's here. There's just something that seems to be missing. No, not the food. It wasn't the drinks, not even the service itself. That's right, the comedy. I'm not sure I laughed but 2 or 3 times the entire hour and a half I stuck it out. The saving grace was that the Olympics were playing on the TV's in the background, but I could have got that same olympic sized entertainment at my own home, and the beer is cheaper there.  If you're looking for a laugh on a Tuesday night, I'd try to stick it out til Wednesday and find your way over to Stand-Up Scottsdale; their open mic is usually worth the time and effort, and its put together in much better fashion - no run on comedians who don't seem to cut the mustard or know when to exit stage left.   They do, from time to time, have live music or a DJ spinning records. Check out their main site for a calendar of events. While I can't speak on those particulars, I imagine you can't really mess up music too badly.   I would like to leave you Yelpers with the following words of advice. If you're out for a great selection of tapped and bottled beer, wine, or liquor in a cool down town atmosphere. Race on down, cause you may have just won gold.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I found myself in the middle of a strange city (Mesa), I was down the street shopping, hungry, and armed with the yelp app on my iphone. I saw a yelp $12 for $24, a groupon $15 for $30, and a yelp check in offer. Decisions, which deal to choose. Most of their meals are anywhere from $10-$12 with tax, so choose accordingly.  We walked in saturday at 6:00 pm, and there was no one else here. My initial thought was that everyone else *might* just know something I don't; perhaps I should find another spot I eat. I reluctantly decided to stay, then ordered the green curry and yellow curry.   A few moments into our meal another couple came in to eat also, which made me feel better, if not just for the restaraunt operator, but for myself also. I'm normally a bit leary of a restaraunt with no customers. Maybe this is just how it is in middle of Mesa, I'm not really an authority on that particular subject though. I usually hang in and around the Phoenix mid-town area.  The food was great! Though I did like the yellow curry better than the green; which is what I would suggest if your looking for curry. Go ahead and order it spicy, it was good. They brought the bill and there was a discrepancy. The yelp check-in offer was clearly $15 and they adjusted the check for 15%. I think the check in offer is SUPPOSED to be 15% and not $15, but they still honored it. I felt obliged and gave them a bigger tip than I ever do; an extra 10% on top of my usual.  Over all a nice spot to calm your inner Thai-ger. Happy dining all you Yelpers!

This spot seems like one of the best deals on the entire strip, and with all the great reviews, how can you pass this place up?  After a day spent strolling around aimlessly, it was time. Time to eat. It's been a bookmark for a while now and decided we'd make a stop this time through town. We were passing right by it - so why not?  The lines were kinda hectic, at first I wasn't sure what to make of it, but after a minute, I saw that there were about 8 lines for ordering your food; direct from the kitchen staff. Watch them cook up your order, then take it to the register to pay. Pretty simple once you realize how it works. Finding a place to sit and eat on the other hand, was a challenge. Five minutes of hovering around the tables, and a spot finally opened up - this place is packed with customers enjoying their meals.  The Carne Asada tacos were excellent, but the disappointer here were the Adobada (spicy pork) fries. Usually a fan of pulled or shredded pork dishes, the Carne Asada would have likely been the better choice to top that huge mound of (half sized) fries; I certainly am glad the lady and I didn't order the large. The pork was good, just not awesome or over the top delicious - I'll plan to stick to the Carne Asada if I stop in again.  With four tacos, a (half) order of fries, and a coke our bill came to about $15 - I dare you to try and find that anywhere else on the strip for less than $30. If you do, please let me know - I'm always down for some tasty tacos.  Happy Yelping!

What can really be said about starbucks that hasn't already? What seems to be 10 years ago awesome coffee has turned into todays "meh... ive had better."  This is the location inside the safeway. I usually stick to a tea, but if you're looking for coffee close to this area, try Lux on central about .5 miles away.

After 17 years and three neighbors water heaters bursting at the seams, it was time to put Ol' Bessie out to pasture. Wanting to avoid late night emergency surgery; as my neighbors recently had, I chose elective replacement of my favorite home appliance. What would my morning shower be without you?  "Well since you're here, you might as well fix the broken valves behind my washing machine that I can't seem to get completely closed." I've been thinking about replacing that soon too, and want to be actually be able to turn off the water when the time comes. He agreed that it was a good idea, especially since the water for the entire building (11 neighbors included) was turned off already. I decided to take care of it now and avoid another scheduled call. :-)  I spent a few minutes with Gabriel while he worked out my plumbing issues, we chatted about some possible future plumbing needs, but I had to run before he finished his work. I left my wife in charge, and while he finished up writing out the paperwork, he reminded her that there was a yelp deal that would save us a couple bucks.  Now my water gets hotter than ever and I no longer have a ticking time bomb waiting to explode in the closet. Thanks for the friendly chat and the great work!  As a spend thrifty individual, I did call around to a few plumbers before making my final choice. Copperstate was no better or worse; within a few bucks, than most of the other reputable (by yelp standards) plumbers. Gabriel was the friendliest to talk to, seemed confident on the phone, so I happily gave him my business and am happy that I did.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, Gabriel will fix you right up, should the need arise!

Great place for vegan delight!   If your looking for a vegan friendly coffee / dessert spot in CenPho, I can think of none better than Nami. I came here for the Tsoynami (a vegan friendly dq blizzard) and was not dissapointed. While I don't think you can ever really compare apples to apples when it comes to dairy desserts and non dairy alternatives, it's about as close as you will find. (I wonder if they have one with apples? probably not). I don't think I will ever really find a replacement for my froyo love.  I can't attest for how healthy they are; I imagine the fat content is fairly low, since it is soy based. For those carb / sugar conscious - the ingredients info isn't really posted anywhere, but I imagine there is a fair amount of sugar in whatever toppings, cookies, and candies that go into your frozen dessert. Just do a couple extra sit-ups, it's worth it!

It's not easy being green, but this place makes it delish ;-)  I ran into Green, well Nami really, looking for frozen desserts; you can't go to Nami and not eventually end up trying Green too. After 5 or so visits, I've never had a bad meal. Lunch seems to be pretty popular here - but never a terribly long wait. Order your meal at the counter, grab your number, find a table, and wait for delivery. The staff are always friendly and smiling - I don't think I've seen someone sad or unhappy to be working here.   On a recent visit the girl at the counter sold me on their daily special, this day's was a bratwurst; vegan of course. Coming with a few options for the side, I settled on their house made coleslaw; which I thoroughly enjoyed. The bratwurst was tasty with a dijan / spicy mustard and sourkraut, but the bun seemed to span the width of three brats and was sliced more like sandwich bread and not like a hot dog bun; I can live with that minor complaint though. I've had their hummus and buffalo wings appetizers, a big wac (their shameless vegan big mac), a thai penut bowl, ranchero salad, and one or two other dishes I can't quite remember at this point; all vegan, all delicious, with my favorite being the ranchero salad - it's my normal go to option here.  I believe I've answered the question of would I come back by actually coming back, once every month or so.  Happy Yelping Phoenix. This spot totally makes it easier to be green ;-)

Nachobot WILL make you cool. "How cool?" you ask.   Well, I just watched a guy walk in wearing bunched up khaki's and a ratty old t-shirt and right as I type this he is walking out with what looks to be low cut skinny jeans, a flashy button up shirt, and the brightest shoes on you could ever imagine. He's adorn with women carrying his order of nacho's drizzled in gooey home-made nacho cheese sauce, topped with slow cooked to perfection spicy colorado beef drowning in its own delicious red sauce, fresh chopped green onion, and loaded with jalapenos. Man... I wish I was that guy.  You know what, sorry, false alarm, the first guy just waked out with his own order of nacho's dawned in caramelized mushrooms, perfectly roasted garlic, pico de gallo and more of that intense looking, home-made nacho cheese. I didn't know you could caramelize mushrooms by the way, but Nachobot seems to know how. I guess the guy wearing the skinny jeans was just in there ahead of khaki.  The real truth behind elevating your cool status is just ending up here. The Roosevelt cool seems to permeate through this place and the rest of this little strip of downtown Phoenix these day's. That's a cold hard fact, cold and hard like ice, but not vanilla ice. Ok maybe vanilla ice back in 1991. Lets face it, he was the epitome of cool for at least a few months during 1990 or 91. Why else would you know who I'm talking about?  Quoted in weekly yelp newsletter: 8-29-2012 http://www.yelp.com/weekly?edition_id=QCOinXdaM-UgFuTcHJfwNQ

Being one of very few spots that seems to cater to people who want to eat a salad; with the competition being places like Whole Foods and AJ's salad bars, you've got to give this place their just desserts. (hah, if only I could just get desserts right now, that would be awesome.)  I'm kind of glad I didn't review this place my first time through a year or so ago. I didn't quite put together the tastiest of salads that time through, but I decided I'd give them another try, I have been watching my figure the last few weeks and this was just the type of spot I wanted for lunch. I threw together a salad with spinach and mixed greens, popped on some jalepenos, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, sun dried tomatos, grilled chicken and topped (lightly) with their house dressing. My combination of veggies and dressing was good this time around and everything tasted fresh, just the way a salad should. No pre made mixtures sitting all day here.  Not exactly a build it yourself, but you tell em what you want, they throw it together, then they toss your salad and away you go. They've got some tasty (looking, all I was here for was a salad) Mediterranean food available too, dolma, falafel, etc. I was feening for some of that delicious looking grilled (or fried, not sure exactly) cauliflower, but I stuck to just a salad this time around. Oh grilled cauliflower, you will be mine, oh yes, you will be mine. I guess I'll have to update my review after I finally come back around for you.  They had a smoothie bar there too; I didn't partake, with a bunch of fresh fruits and juices at their disposal. I imagine it's kinda hard to mess up a smoothly too badly.  They're located in the ASU downtown campus building at Fillmore and Central avenue; no need to enter the building, find em on the Central ave side. Parking isn't terrible for those of you who are driving down here. Find a metered spot, spend the $1.50 for the hour and enjoy your lunch. Hey, these meters accept cards now!  Happy Yelping Phoenix, enjoy your freshly tossed salad ;-)

I was in the line at chipotle for lunch trying to figure out just how much froyo I could get for my $7 instead of a burrito. It turns out that you can get about 16 oz worth! Since I already have a predisposition to all things froyo, it wasn't that hard a decision - sorry chipotle :/  Zoyo really hit the spot on this hot June day during during my daily break from the office. I sampled all the flavors and ended up filling my cup with about 6 different flavors, cause thats just how I do it.  The glass garage door that opens towards McDowell seems like it would be cool to open during those idyllic Phoenix 80% days. Everything was kept clean; but at the same time, it was during the business lunch hours with no kids in sight and only about 8 people inside.  Although my inner cheapskate wishes there was a groupon or check in deal of some sort, being just a short bike ride from my place up the street, I can almost assuredly tell you that I will be back at some point down the line.   I don't always eat frozen desserts, but when I do, I eat froyo. ;)

Bianco used to own the market on artisan pizza in Phoenix, and in some opinions, all of the USA. In the past few years a number of artisan pizza spots have opened which are bringing Pizzeria Bianco some competition. Still, few compare to what Pizzera Bianco keeps delivering to the table time and time again.   I've been told by more than one person the pizzas here are "Amazing", "spectacular", "the best anywhere", and so on. While I did enjoy the thin crust and the fresh, flavorful toppings and ingredients, I was not completely blown away by the pizza here. I think the trouble is that there is *s*o*  *m*u*c*h* hype around these pizzas, it's impossible to go into this expecting anything other than "the absolute, hands down, best meal you've ever eaten". When you get to the other side of your dining experience, you find the meal just didn't quite live up to your expectations.  With that said, there's only one spot in Phoenix I like better than Bianco, and that's Federal. I'm not going to tell you it's the most amazing meal you'll ever eat, but in the world of artisan pizza, it's seriously hard to beat. I'd implore you to try Bianco for yourself, go in with appropriate expectations of a "really good pizza" and you won't be underwhelmed like I was.   If you feel like taking this Yelper's advice, stop in here for a pizza, go out and try the rest, then create your own informed, flavor filled opinion.  Happy Yelping Phoenix! Go eat pizza :-)

Well I'm not sure Wy-Knot, but I will tell you Wy.  We were cought in a storm this past Sunday while on a bike ride into downtown Phoenix. The wind and rain was so rough, you could barely see two feet in front of you. Destined for a local coffee shop we pushed on. Ducking for cover as debris flew over head and weaving around ice cap melting sun spots, we finally made it to our destination.   ...Well, it really was just a normal bike ride, but a death defying bike ride in a face melting storm sounds so much more dramatic. ;)  After arriving at our original destination, neither of us had worked up an appetite yet, so we leisurely headed back towards home. Passing McDowell on Central, I decided to stop in somewhere new, so we aimed for 7th street and ultimately Wy-Knot.   Surviving such a horrendous storm, we had set our desires on something awesome, and our main dishes both lived up to our high breakfast expectations. Their morning frittatas we're delightful. I was craving something fresh and tasty, and the spinach, mushroom, onion, and feta was just that; though, I went sans mushrooms. I'm not really much of a mushroom fan, maybe even an anti-fan if there is such a thing. You might even see a "Calvin peeing on a mushroom" bumper sticker on my car. The wife ordered a frittata also, but with egg whites.   We also asked them to add in zucchini and the wait / kitchen staff was happy to oblige. The fruit sides were fresh, sweet, and ripened to perfection. The diced and fried potatoes were good, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside and were cooked with chopped peppers and onions.  Their menu has vegan options also, tofu scrambles and such, but I was really looking for a light and healthy-ish egg breakfast. So I opted for the frittata. Maybe if im feeling veggie one day, ill give it a shot.   Our meal was about $10-$11 per person after food, taxes, and tip, not terrible. Over all, a better than expected meal and worth skipping other diners in the area if you're trying to stay a bit on the non greasy / healthier side.   Happy Dining all my Yelping friends, and watch out for those microstorms, you never know just when or where they will pop up.

IT'SUGAR certainly sounds like a candy store, but if you think that's what you're walking into, you're in for a *treat.   I'd say this place is a novelty shop, with lots of candy too. Sure, there's candy bins with some of the most expensive (priced) candy in town, but where else are you going to find a huge rice crispy, ginormous gummy bear, ridiculously large chocolate bar, and all in one place? That's right, It's sugar is about the only place you will.   There were literally kids in this candy store and I can first handedly tell you, the saying 'like a kid in a candy store' is true. I just couldn't stop from touching everything, licking the candy bins and running around asking if I could have whatever would fit in my hands.  Novelty shop or candy store? ... you decide!  Happy Yelping Phoenix, sometimes it's ok to be a kid in the candy store.

Who doesn't like an amazing cheese steak?  ... well, Vegans wouldn't dream of it, Vegetarians are on the fence, cows for sure wouldn't touch the stuff, (but what about mad cows? maybe), supermodels only eat celery I hear, crazy people wouldn't know what to do with one, Hindus for sure make this list, and kids under 6 just don't like cheese steaks - they do like steak and they do like cheese, just not at the same time or on a bun.  If you happen to find yourself in one of the above demographics; please save yourself the regret and go to 'Green New American Vegetarian' just down the street. Otherwise, you'll find one fantastic cheese steak here.   Anticipate large chunks of thick cut steak, grilled up to a perfect tender consistency, gussied up with sauteed onions and peppers, with just the right amount of gourmet flavoring; like chipotle, covered in a top shelf cheese sauce, topped with sliced jalapenos.  ... and that was just one of the options you find here. Calling all cheese steak lovers of Phoenix, this should be one of your dining destinations. Have them toss in more of those tender chunks of lovin for just $2 more and find yourself dining in or walking out the door with the biggest steak sandwich you can dream of for about $9.  Eat on you steak lovin Yelpers!

"Twerk!, twerk!, twerk!, twerk!"  This guy puts on a show! He's extremely talented with balloons and crafts just about anything you can dream up. I met him at an adults only pool party at Luster Bar in downtown recently, I'm guessing this was quite the change of pace for him from the normal birthday party.  Dizzie crafted a dancer out of balloons, right before our eyes, attached her to a hat and it was passed from person to person for the next few hours. I then saw him create an intricate hat weaved, twisted, and sewn from seven or eight different balloons. No swords and basic hat's from this guy. From there, he went on to create a few more balloon sculptures, and had I kept up with him I would have spent the whole party watching; I decided to move on to the pool.  While swimming I saw him from across the pool, wearing a life guard t-shirt, and he was all too excited to join into my humorous shtick. At one point he saved me from "fake drowning" in the three feet deep pool. If I ever throw a party, I know who I'm bringing for entertainment. Dizzie, You're quite the entertainer!  Happy Yelping Phoenix, this guy is a man of many talents.

Visited the phoenix public market - open air market - farmers market they have on saturday mornings and decided to give mojo bowl a try! They are at the market for food truck fridays also. Check out their website for their usual schedule. They can take cash or credit (with square).  I tried their strawberry banana smoothie and my wife had the Funky Monkey (peanut butter / chocolate blend). They were both great quality with fresh ingrediants. They serve salads, yogurt parfaits, and soup also (which I didn't try) but Ive heard their smoothies was where they shine and they did not dissapoint. Give them a try, at $5.00 for a 24 oz smoothie, you can't really complain about the price - its basically a meal itself.

Cool new spot in CenPho. I was torn between the mexican gyro and the cuban sandwich. After looking over the menu choices, I went with the Mexican Gyro.   While not made with the traditional lamb the slow cooked pork was a good substitute. The Mexican Gyro, seems more a fancy name than an actual depiction of the food you are about to eat. I was half expecting a mexican spiced lamb with a chipotle or spicy yogurt sauce. It's more of a pork Gordita - an upscale taco   with corn salsa and sour cream dressings on a pita instead of corn tortilla.  Im always looking for the best deals around town, and unfortunately, I wouldn't really include this stop as one of them. After dropping $9+ with tax and tip, I was still a bit peckish. A small side salad; or side of any type, would really complete this as a meal.  Over all great tasting food, I look forward to my next visit.

We biked down after work today to try out fuego's newest restaurant, and if you know me at all though, you know my real motivation was the froyo next door. It was the "let's try out the new Fuego" that convinced my wife to go. ;)  Fuego cityscape brings you a collection of the best of their options from their collective menus. We came in during happy hour and shared the pork quesadilla and chicken street tacos. The food is eerily similar to fuego taco and fuego bistro, but I can't say much about how it relates to fuego cantina in north phoenix, since i've not been there yet myself. If you're a fan of Bistro or Taco, you'll definitely enjoy the food here also.  The pork quesadilla was definitely a winner, not sure what was in the sauce which topped the juicy roasted pork, but it was sweet, tasty and defintiely worth ordering. The chicken tacos were a solid choice, but I'll likely skip them and try something different next time.  There's not too much room for them to work with in this new location, but they did ok with the space. The ambiance isn't exactly what I was expecting from Fuego, it's sort of a mall food court chic, or qdoba / chipotle looking layout. The soda dispenser is out in the middle of the dining area, and what looked to be a counter over looking the kitchen area. I wasn't sure at first if we were supposed to sit then order, order then sit, fill our own cups, wait to be seated - I'm thinking they are likely utilizing the space from the last tenant (vitimin t tacos) with no modifications.The wait staff happliy directed us to a table and began asking about drinks and food, wich eased my over all confusion.   And no, I didn't have to fill my own drink glass.  Over all, I loved the food, but wasn't too excited about the ambiance and layout. It seems to be setup to suit more of an on the go lunch crowd than an after work or evening dining experience. If I come back again, I'll likely try the meatloaf sliders, also a happy hour deal at $6. Who doesn't like a good meatloaf?

The Photo Booth Limerick.  As socially acceptable as it may seem, bunches of photos on Social chimp's endless reem. Grab your pals and a disguise; goof around and wink your eyes. These snaps will be the talk of your entire kickball team.  I was all gussied up at Yelp Helps 2012 and ran into The Social Chimp. With mustache in hand, the gang and I acted as crazy as possible while they snapped action shots of jumping, laughing, pointing, and posing. I can't wait to download the digitals to post everywhere!  These guys would be a much talked about and never forgotten addition to any office party, company picknick, wedding, holiday party, or knock-out birthday celebration.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, I look forward to seeing all those action shots!

Why'd the chicken cross the road? To get to Food Truck Fridays in Downtown Phoenix!  I know that all you business Yelpers go out for lunch on Friday's, it's basically a rule if you sit in an office, a cubicle, or behind a desk somewhere from Monday through Friday; don't believe me, check the company hand book you were given on your first day of work. Somewhere between how to comb your hair, what you shouldn't wear, and please don't come in smelling like Nair, you'll find it. While Yelping about your Friday lunch is purely optional, I certainly hope you do ;-)  During your weekly 1 hour exodus into the space beyond the cubicles and plaster walls, ending up in the open air of Food Truck Friday will kick off your weekend right. It's not just for Burger King people, it's time to get it your way!   Pick your favorite food from, Gourmet Hot dogs with Short Leash, or Mexican with Luncha Libre, Smoothies and Salads with Mojo Bowl, to Pies with Mama Toledos, and Creme Brulee with Torched Goodness. Bring your friends and your favorite gal; they can choose their own favorite too. Don't worry about bringing cash, everyone here will swipe your plastic just as easy.  This is your lunch hour, kick back and forget about work while you're here, if only for 45 minutes. Listen to the DJ's spinning popular music through their thumping sound system while you dine on your fine food. Chill out in the seating area which is cordoned off with misters, fans, and swamp coolers; bringing down the temp from a roasting 108 to a palatable upper 90's.   This is your Downtown business Yelpers, it's time to kick off those business casuals, and make Friday lunch your own!

You gotta feel it, It's electric!  I hope you're prepared to boogie woogie for almost an entire year, cause that's about how long you'll be waiting for a chance to slide into your own all electric Tesla.   You gotta know it, it's electric. With up to a 300 mile all electric battery range, the Model S (and all Tesla's) are custom built to customer specifications; they begin delivering this years models in fall of 2012, but you've got to already be on the list to get yours. These baby's start at $57,000 (for model S) with a 160 mile range and can sport up to a 300 miles with an upgrade to the batteries ($77,000). You're in luck though, cause right now you can get a sleek $7,500 tax credit from the US Federal Government for buying electric!  But you know it's there, plug in everywhere. Model S comes standard with everything needed to plug in to any 240 or 120 volt outlet or public charging station. Charge yourself about 100 miles worth in 3 hours in a standard 110, or 100 miles in 1.5 hours from a 240 volt charging station. If you're worried about un-necessary charging and wasted electricity, the charge shuts off after the battery has reached capacity; I asked the Tesla rep!  I've got to move, come let me take you on a party ride. Racing from 0 to 60 in 5.6 seconds with 0 emissions, Al Gore might just throw you a party for helping to save the planet. This beauty is sleekly styled with aerodynamic feel, and toutes a low center of gravity with their innovative floor mounted battery design achieving optimal weight distribution. Be the envy of all your friends (eventually) with a 17'' driver control touch screen, and connect up all your Bluetooth or USB devices.  Some say it's mystic, it's electric. Nothing mystic about it, this is American engineering and ingenuity at its finest! Man I wish I had one. Although, I'd have a tough time re-charging without an outlet nearby my parking spot. Maybe I could talk to the neighborhood HOA about that one.  Stop in to their storefront located inside Scottsdale Fashion Square on the second floor. Yelpers, it's time you learned the electric slide, but in Tesla style!

Your inner artist has been dyeing to get out!   Explore some of the most eclectic venues, galleries, and spaces that downtown Phoenix has to offer. Everyone knows the heart of the Phoenix First Friday experience happens around Roosevelt and 5th street, but feel free to check out many of the surrounding business' who get in on the action too. Places like Civic Space Park and Crescent Ballroom, or Bliss /ReBAR and Turf Irish Pub.  Savvy Yelpers know to park somewhere along Portland street and 5th street - just north of where all the action happens; although any parking close to Roosevelt between 2nd and 7th street will get you close to the action. Don't forget that metered spots in downtown are free after 5pm and all day Saturday and Sunday. The super savvy just grab a Light Rail ride, hop off at the Roosevelt stop, and head east by foot.  It's fun to hang around people watching, stop in for a coffee or a crepe at JoBot coffee shop, or stop by one of the public exhibitions of live music happenings you can usually find. I wouldn't be surprised to find an impromptu drum circle in the makings, or a home baker selling their delightful cupcakes and goodies for a few bucks and a high five! Heck, they'll even sell you two for a couple more bucks and two high fives.  Tour the many individual galleries and wait for your mind to be melted by some of the most fantastic and off the wall pieces you'll see; most pieces done by local artists. It's ok to just go and look, they really don't mind. In fact, I haven't spent a dime on a piece of art during my few ventures to FF, but I have spent plenty of dimes on everything else that's happening.  Cruise over to the normally vacant lot on Roose between 4th and 5th street to find yourself in a space that gets transformed into a food truck and trinket vendor's paradise. Taco's, check. Hot Dogs, check. Burger, check. Coffee, check. I think you get the picture.  Don't forget your comfy shoes, bring your friends, and have fun! Honestly, what else are you going to do on a Friday night in Phoenix? See a movie or go clubbing?  Happy Yelping Phoenix, I'll see you at First Friday's!

It's been a while since I first wrote my review of The Nash, but first impressions can often lead to mis-interpretations. As I sit, it's one of their Sunday improv jazz nights (6-9pm every Sunday) and I'm listening to the band kick out a Dizzy Gillespie tune. The upright base is kicking it, the drummer is keeping time perfectly, and the pianist is rocking out, well as rocking as you can really get with this one. I've been back a number of times since that first pass by on First Friday, and my opinion of this spot has dramatically improved.   Improv jazz Sundays involves a solid core trio of musicians as they bring in random musicians just waiting to strut their stuff. $5 for the general public and $2 (or $3 - can't remember exactly) for musicians going up on stage. Show up on a Wednesday at 7:30 and they've got a practicing brass band and you can sit in the audience for $5 per person.  Every week they showcase up and coming jazz musicians, local jazz stars in their own right, or touring musicians who've risen the ranks. Some bigger named shows will cost ya $50+, some shows $15, either way this is a nice place to come for some live jazz.  Onward and upward, to the really important parts, no kitchen an no bar will leave you dining on candy bars and bottles of soda, a dumbed down movie theater snack bar type of experience, don't fret. The Nash has a BYOB policy that stands against the best. Bring your own beer or wine for a corking fee $5 for wine and $2 for beer I think, but I'd suggest consulting their website for these specifics.   With 12 or so 4 top tables, a high top bar-esq seating that fits 10 or so along the back of he room and some random chairs lined up along the edges of the venue, I'd say this place comfortably sits 75 or so. Checking out the neighbors you'll see people who brought pick nick baskets and coolers with them and have made a night of it. A perfect way to dine on cheese and meats, sip a little vino all while listening to some classy jazz. I'm definitely gonna stop and get a to go order next time from my favorite hot dog joint next door for my dining pleasure.  Concerned about you're attire? Don't be, downtown is Phoenix chic! Put on your nicest shorts, summer dress, jeans, sandals and a clean shirt and you'll fit right in. If you feel like getting dolled up, business casual also works here, but I've never seen any one in a ball gown or tuxedo here ;-)  If you've remained misinformed this whole time about Phoenix culture, well, consider yourself informed. One of my favorite spots to listen to some live jazz, bring your pals, bring your gals, you'll have an enjoyable evening!  Happy yelping Phoenix, I'll see you at the Nash!!

I have a hard time deciding what to write about Angels Trumpet, not being a fan of beer, it's hard to give any of the breweries around town a fair shake. On their menu they've got items like spam sliders, home made pop tarts, flatbread pizza. Their beer menu is lovingly written on chalkboards around the bar and there's a huge ton amount of them; a real measurement BTW, look it up in any engineering book, if you can't find it right away, just keep looking.  Again, while we've already established I don't really love beer, I have partook from time to time, it's unavoidable when all your friends are doin it ;-)  I do enjoy their tasty salads, have sampled a number of other items from the menu and have never experienced anything I wouldn't order again; except for maybe that weird dessert pizza thing. It's like a big mixture of things from around your kitchen that you would make and scarf down when you've had one or two-welve to many. I love the hip downtown atmosphere and it's a great spot to gather with friends or randomly run into them, cause everyone is usually already there.  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

While I have not personally visited this establishment, I was contacted by a staff member with the following offer. I'm not in the habbit of accepting free services in an effort to "buy" my review, and I'm fairly sure it's also against Yelp policies to do so.   Dr. Tattoff, I would suggest re-considering your marketing strategy of emailing random yelp members asking them to come in for a free service in return for a yelp review.  Here's a copy of the message I was sent. Good luck and Happy Yelping.   My name is ***** and I am a Registered Nurse at Dr Tattoff on Mill Ave. I'm looking for someone just like you to review our services here. We are of course looking for your absolute honest review. That said I'm sure you will be thoroughly impressed by our clean an friendly environment.  We would like to get you started with a free photo-facial, hair removal treatment or a tattoo removal treatment. Any positive and/or negative productive feedback would be helpful to our success.   Please reach me at my email: *****@drtattoff.... or ***-***-**** with any questions or to book an appointment.  I look forward to meeting you in the near future!  **** **** R.N. Dr. Tattoff, Inc.

Some might call me a super-fan, but when Upward Projects does something, you can't help but love it. In the game of artisan pizza, Federal kneads out the competition.   Having tried most pizzas from their menu, I've landed on the Manifesto as my normal order. I love the Manifesto, with exception of the mushrooms, so when I order it, I always sub for brussels sprouts instead, sometimes I'm feeling a little frisky and have them throw sweet potato on there too. Not only are they happy to make these changes for me, but the server usually says something like "That sounds delicious, I need to try it!"  The manifesto, with goat cheese, red sauce, fennel, schriener's sausage, and brussels sprouts is delish. The toppings are always super fresh, the crust is a bit crispier than most other artisan pizza's from around town and the service is always excellent.  $12 - $15 will buy you a pizza sized well enough for one hungry dude or in my case, large enough for two to share. Joining their email posse will usually score you a free pizza once or twice a year for things like your birthday or promotions they feel like running.  Their vegetable side is neither here nor there in my opinion, likely because I don't love carrots, but the broccolini were delish.   If you're a dessert fan (remember two deSSerts and one deSert, in case you can never remember how to spell dessert or desert for that matter) they generally always have a fruit cobbler of some sort. If it's mixed berry, you must order it, dessert fans everywhere insist. Oddly enough, I don't order dessert at many places, mostly because I'm generally looking out for my figure, but in this case, I wouldn't be eating pizza either, but when I am, I sometimes order dessert. Go all out right? ;-)  Enough rambling and back to the part we're all waiting for... the end of this review.  Always delish, always fresh, and no one has ever actually gotten fresh with me while dining here, not yet at least.   Happy Yelping Phoenix!

I really enjoyed the Certified Local First Fall Festival. With about 30 + local vendors, restaurants, and shops you can feel good about spending your money with someone who lives just down the road from you. I always love to see local business doing well - and that's what I call 'Winning'.  We sampled foods from Urban Cookies, Nami / Green, Culinary Dropout, Spinatos pizza, a few other random food stops of which I can't remember. Many samples were $1, some were $2, some spots even handed you a coupon or discount to come check out their full menu or local shop.   I can't wait to join in the fun next year to see more locals doing what they do best, providing great service and personality to our local community!  Happy Yelping Phoenix!

A phoestivus for the rest of us.   Air your grievances and dance around the phoestivus pole. As you shop local for your family, friends, and that weird guy named Cole.  With samples to tempt your palate; pickled celery, cookies, tamales, and more.  If you're getting hungry, don't wait. There's plenty of food trucks galore.  Forgot to get that yearly family holiday photo for display? The social station (booth) will hook you up with an action shot or kissy face, no delay.  After picking through jewelry, baked goods, and hand made bow ties. Get your gifts wrapped free by Lindsey F, the Yelper in disguise.  I had a blast eating shortleash dogs and chatting with friends. Hope to see you there next week, hurry and get there before it ends.

If you want to feel like a man, don't go rubbing on some old spice. Come shop at Hard Goods for about ten minutes, It'll put some testosterone back in your morning commute.  With furniture and decor made from casted concrete, manly scented soaps, beard oils, locally crafted bow ties, metal Iphone cases, leather wallets, and stuff made from wood; it's a man's art gallery and everything's waiting for a home - your home.   Looking to get a Valentine for your 'man's man' man? Is your boyfriend's birthday just around the corner? Need that perfect item to buck up your dude after his annual colonoscopy exam? Does your "other child" need to feel better about himself after a day at the golf course? Is it getting closer and closer to Father's day? Does your man get picked on by other, manlier, men?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, come here, buy something, wrap it in newspaper, toilet paper, or no paper at all, hand it to em, and yer done. Lollies are for suckers - stop in here to find the perfect thing to help him look, feel, or smell like a man.  Happy Yelping Phoenix. If it looks like a man, feels like a man, and smells like a man, it probably came from Hard Goods.   ... Maybe I should pick something up for myself.

I'm not planning to come back, but wouldn't say no if someone else wanted to go.  I've visited twice now with mixed experiences. I thought the food was as expected from a Fox restaurant. Not exactly to die for, but definitely better than a Chili's. My aversion to loving this spot is the menu prices and the extreme wait during a lunch "hour", and I use the term hour loosely there.  Had I not been out to lunch with my boss already, I would have likely had a stern "talking to" when I got back to the office two hours later. We had six people at our table and took about five or so minutes to peruse the menu. The staff was quick to deliver our drinks, but four salads, a burger, a meatloaf and 50 minutes later meant my lunch hour turned into a lunch two hour. I didn't exactly expect a ten minute turn around on our food; but really, almost an hour to deliver these dishes is seriously extreme. Even though my boss was with me, by the end of our lunch I was itching to get back to the office as to not waste any more time.  The burger I ordered was on the menu at $12, not exactly cheap to begin with. The waitress asked if I would like fries or a salad with it, but I asked if there was a vegetable I could have instead and she was happy to bring it out with asparagus. Regrettably, she failed to mention an added charge to make that swap from spuds to veg. My $12 burger, now $18 after fees, tax, and tip, is why I usually skip lunches during the week and bring in my own from home. :-(  I did; however, like the food itself, the company, the location, and the waitress was nice enough as well as apologetic about the long wait. I like the LARGE outdoor patio complete with shuffle board, corn hole, ping pong, and foosball. Seems like it could be a fun place to come for drinks in the evening hours with a couple of work buddies.  On my previous visit, I had the meatloaf, the meatloaf itself was good - and I did really enjoy the green beans, but not awesome and not really worth the price IMO, especially when adorn with what can only be described as fancy ketchup, really, ketchup on a $16 meatloaf (after tax-tip). Honestly, I feel the food on the menu is priced about 20% too high for most of the items. I wouldn't mind returning for happy hour, but outside of that, I'll likely just stick to "grabbing a drink" or two with friends if I'm ever back.

The pizza here was the only plus.  We experienced less than mediocre service, my food came out way late - about 15 minutes after the other 5 people at our table received their orders, we had to ask for drink refills at one point, we also had to ask twice to bring out a dipping sauce to go with our tables meals. Once for the sauce, a second time ten minutes later to remind them that it never came to our table. A mistake like burning our pizza and taking an extra 15 + minutes should warrant the floor manager to come to our table and apologize at the very least, which didn't happen.  The restaurant is setup more like a sports bar than a sit down and enjoy your meal type of pizza spot. Inside is pretty loud, difficult to hear, and hard to hold a conversation due to the distracting TV's playing sports located in every direction. I understand I wasn't in downtown phoenix and perhaps the local clientele expects this sort of place when dining out for pizza, but it surely wasn't for me and I don't plan on visiting again.   After all the shortcomings of the service, the kitchen mistake, the management, and the restaurant itself, I did actually enjoy the pizza. It was reasonably tasty, but not worth the $15+ price tag for a personal sized pizza, especially when your dining experience is super lame and uninspiring.  Humble Pie, I know you can do way better than this - I know I'm not the only person who writes of crappy experiences at this place. Apparently you've been giving bad service since you opened doors and haven't taken the hint yet.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, might I suggest delivery or perhaps Digiorno?

Good *little* spot for tasty burgers and tacos.   I see lots of people checking in here all the time, and they've got a solid four star rating, of course I wanted to check the place out. Then deal chicken had a run on burgers apparently and were selling $20 to The Stand for just $10, so we bought it. I hate to waste a good deal, so we planned to visit for dinner one day, missed it and planned the next week, over and over. Finally, we landed here for lunch on a random Thursday.   Is it better than an In-N-Out? I don't know, but it was pretty close in taste, and bigger in size. Who doesn't like bigger? This IS America, right? Everything was fresh, tasty, and I left feeling like I'll be back at some point in the near (or distant) future - who knows.  We tried a couple of the ($3) short rib tacos, delish'. A ($5.50) burger with cheese, and we added ($.75) grilled jalapeños to it, also a great idea if you want to spice it up a bit. $2 will buy you an order of Mexican corn, a (half) ear of corn covered with chipotle mayo, cheese, and chili powder. A reasonable sampling of their menu, and over all it was a great (unhealthy) meal.  After ordering, we stood off to the side for a few minutes chatting while waiting for our order to be called, and waited, and waited some more. Before I even realized we weren't getting our order, the lady behind the counter asked me what we had ordered, I guess she noticed us standing there, and everyone else getting their orders filled. I probably would have gone another 5 minutes or so before realizing. Apparently the POS (point of sale)  ;-) forgot to print out the order for the kitchen. Great service, I thought. Thanks for noticing!  My only issue with The Stand is the extreme limited seating. During lunch, and I can only imagine I was not the only person annoyed with this, there was a consistent line of about 5 groups of people ordering food, with only 4 tables inside to sit. Probably not a big deal eight months of the year, but August is definitely not one of those eight wonderful Phoenix months. I am not about sitting outside on a patio during lunch, sweatin to the oldies, and then heading back to work, no thanks. Adding insult to injury, there was a rather large group of people chatting away who were set up at three of the four inside tables that had finished their meal 20 + minutes ago, ARGHGGHHG. That was not very considerate, considering the room full of people holding their trays of food fighting for a spot to eat. Finally, the fourth table cleared out and we were able to snatch it up.  I decided to sit on the same side of the booth as my wife, in case someone else wanted to sit on the other side; I guess no one was outgoing enough to randomly join, but at least I tried. We ate our food, with a bit of small talk, wiped our table and went on our way. There were still 6 or so people aimlessly wandering around for a seat, and the moment we stood up someone else grabbed the booth; all the while the one large group was still chatting away, drinking their soda's, taking up three tables.  I'm not sure how off putting something like this would be to diners, but I'd suggest trying out some friendly, non-threatening signage asking something like "please consider diners waiting to enjoy this spot too" to be put out during peak times; like lunch on a Thursday, and put away during other times. We enjoyed the food, enjoyed the service, but didn't enjoy getting cramped up into the little box of a dining room on a lunch break. I'm guessing this is a much better drive through spot than dine in.  Happy Yelping Phoenix! Please, drive on through for your order. :-)

I know many reviews start out just as this one is, but I can't hardly believe the 4 and 5 star reviews at this spot. On a whim, I stopped in, feeling like some veggies, I ordered up some tempura. I know, I know, tempura is fried and it sorta unqualified veggies as a healthy option, but why the heck not!  The tempura had tons of breading had to be a solid 1/2 inch thick, it was more like caked than lightly battered, I picked the batter off and ate the few veggies that tasted ok. Still on the healthy-esq kick, I went with garlic chicken sub veggies for the rice. Well, the chicken was *way overcooked, and seriously under flavored, and the veggies, the vegetables were not even palatable, think out of a can or freezer then boiled.   I didn't even dent the meal, they asked if I wanted the rest to take home... Uhh, You can keep your doggie bag, no thanks!  But the wait staff was super friendly, too bad it doesn't come close to making up for this quality of food.   Happy yelping Phoenix, hope you have a better experience than I, should you also decide to dine in.

There's no place like Pomo. Take a ride from the farm and walk down the shimmering yellow road, it will lead you to a magical kingdom like none other, the Kingdom of Pomo, ruled by David the bartender. Enter the door, belly up to the bar and let David take care of your every knead.  I promise, this trip is worth dodging flying monkeys and battling the wicked witch of the west (side) where her tastiest pizza is akin to mall food court. Not that it's all bad, but in comparison, it's mall food court; they all fall short.  In the battle of phoenix pizzerias, Pomo takes top billing for me these days, delicious, fresh, oh man, it's soo good. When you're finished with your meal, don't forget to ask them about their limoncello; the best anywhere and best yet, this is a complimentary after dinner drink. Tell them your friends say they serve the best limoncello in all the land and they'll promptly and proudly serve one up in a flash.  Happy yelping Phoenix, if you're going for Pomo later, don't forget to invite me along ;-)

Five score years ago two great Americans, Brad and Kat, signed the Short Leash food truck proclamation. This momentous decree of great bacon, sausages, naan bread and gourmet toppings will be seared in the flames of delicious. But years later we face the tragic fact that we are still not free, not free to eat Short Leash when we want it.  But there is something that I must say to my people who stand in the long lines which leads into the palace of delicious. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and eat Short Leash whenever we want. I have a dream that one day we will be able to sit down together at a table inside a restaurant. I have a dream today.   It's not every day that dreams become reality, but the dream of dining at Short Leash on a whim, whenever we feel like, without waiting in lines has come to fruition.  I had the privilege of visiting during their friends and family preview, and left with great conviction to visit over and over again. They've got a few restaurant only items on their menu like Scotch Eggs, savory Funnel Cakes, and a few other gems I'll let you discover for yourself. They're serving beer and wine on their menu now, with a pitcher costing you just $7.50  Short Leash Sit...Stay will be a great addition to Roosevelt Row's way of life.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, I can't wait to see you there!

Watch out, cause this place will cut you good!  I first met Jacob the owner at a yelp sponsored guys night out and immediately fell in love with the whole monthly rate concept and the decent haircut I received. Pay once and come as often as you want, yes please. If you're not careful, I might just end up sitting in the chair all day, every day. While that would be detrimental to my employment (not showing up and all), my hair would look mighty fine, all the time! ;-)  On my second visit, my awesome first impression was cut down a little, but I'll give them a few more tries before a final conclusion. The wait was just about all I could bear. After arriving and adding my name to the list close to about 5pm on a Wednesday, I saw four people waiting and two stylists working. At a minimum it looked like I'd be sitting for 30 minutes. Alas! My name was called, turned out to be a 25 min wait.  The following visits here, have certainly sealed the deal for me. I visited on a lunch break about 11 (ish) am on a Thursday. Put my name in, sat down, and was called up to the chair about 30 seconds later. Impatience has certainly paid off for me coming during a lunch break. I told them to cut the sides about a 4 and trim the top to match. That's generally been my go to cut, for a few years now. It should be noted that this particular visit has spoiled me to every other stylist here; Mari, OMG Mari does an awesome job, every time!  Let's fast forward a few visits now, I've decided that the monthly membership is an awesome concept. For $24 a month plus a few $ each visit for a tip, I'm spending between $30 and $40 a month, depending on how diligently I keep up my weekly lunch cuts plus a tip on each visit. I missed Mari a few times and determined that she's the $#!T, and I won't let anyone else there keep me cut. I was complaining about how my hair parted one day; a month or so ago, and gave her carte blanche to basically do whatever she felt like. That day, I ended up with a 1 on the sides and back, a hard part, and the top long but faded into the sides. OMG, I don't think I can ever go back to the nondescript 'short on the sides and trim the top' cut that I was so accustom to.  They're a no frills sort of place, if you want to be served a beer while you sit or a scalp massage when you're done, you will be disappointed here. If you're thinking about a new style or even just your usual cut, I implore you to make Keep It Cut your new stop, and certainly ask if Mari is there. You won't regret it, she really is the number one reason I keep coming back, week after week! (number two being the monthly subscription)  Now for the harsh reality, the negatives. I'd love to see some sort of appointment setting or call ahead scheduling, I might even be willing to spend some extra for that sort of, jump ahead of the line at 6pm sort of service. Coming in after school lets out for the day turns this place into a glorified super cuts, so many kids waiting to get their hair cut, and why not, they make getting a haircut soo affordable.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, a clean cut is the only way to go, and they make it easy on your wallet to keep coming back!

Lately I tend to go back to a place a few times before giving a review, and Pizza People Pub is no exception to this recent trend. On my first visit I came during their opening week for a Downtowner's Lunch UYE. They had $5 specials this week on many of their pizzas and salads. Of course, we all ordered two items and left over stuffed that particular day. The salad was so tasty that I might actually be willing to admit that I liked it more than the pizza, whaaat? Did I just say that out loud?  For the Super Bowl (2014), Pizza People put out a pizza, appetizer and salad buffet. Best pizza buffet in town. I've seen them do a pizza buffet once or twice since and it's worth every penny of the $15 or $20 per person they charge for it.  I've been back for a random lunch once or twice since, and the quality is always good, but still not my favorite pizza in town. If you love salads, I would suggest you come here, order a salad, and leave ecstatic that you just had a fantastic salad. If you're here for the pizza, everyone has their own opinion, and everyone seems to have their own favorite. This isn't my personal favorite, but I'd never say no if friends wanted to go here for the random lunch or dinner.  Happy Yelping Phoenix. If you haven't yet picked your favorite pizza in Phoenix (and even if you have), be sure to stop by Pizza People Pub!

Yelp Elites are taking over the bar at Outback? Count me in.   While I wouldn't consider myself the biggest fan of Outback; per se, I am a fan of getting together, chatting with pals, meeting other Yelpers and having fun! Outback sampled their new Happy Hour menu for us; food and drink items at $4 each. Fried Shrimp, Potato Chip Nachos, Flat Breads, martinis, and margaritas.  FYI, If you need someone to sing "kookaburra sits in the old gum tree" to fill out a square of Yelp Bingo, I'm your guy. I'm also happy to pose in the background for a staged photo bomb achieving that perfectly impromptu look everybody's going for.  Yelp Bingo is always a blast at these events, you're forced to introduce yourself to people you've not met before, do things you wouldn't normally do - at least in public, and cut through that social safety net we normally hang on to in an effort to play the game. I'm always happy to meet new people, so if you think you see me walking around, don't forget to say "Hi" !  If it turns out to be someone else, don't feel awkward, just tell them they look just like your handsome friend Jon! ;-)  Thanks for a fun evening everybody and I look forward to seeing you at the next one!

Whats more better than all the food you can eat? All the food you can eat and you didn't have to pay for it. That and using proper English -- more better ;-).   Thanks to our pal for hooking us up with tickets to this event. This years event was at the Arizona Biltmore resort, and it was quite nice. With restaurants like Oink Café, Tacos De Juarez, Mrs. Whites Golden Rule, Ra Sushi bar, Aloha Cakes serving up their best foods to sample, what's not to enjoy?  At $35, The tickets to this food event are about half as much as most other tasting events around Phoenix, granted most of the other events have some higher end spots serving their finest dishes. The staff were pretty fast to clear the tables as they gathered cups and plates. The drinks were a bit on the cheap side, as in cheap alcohol and mixers, but they were included in the cost and basically all you can drink (with 12 tickets per person).  I'd have to say my favorite dish was the beef rib tips, they basically fell off the bone, and I loved the carrot cake cupcake that was served by one of the cake vendors (which I can't quite recall). I'm glad I got that first, since two hours into it, all their cupcakes seemed to be served and eaten.  There were oddball vendors sprinkled out the event, one spot displaying their e-cigarettes and another selling shredding services. I heard the line didn't start moving until 15 minutes after the event start last year, and this year didn't seem to be any different. Overall it was worth the $ I didn't pay, but I'd be down with paying to get in next year.  See you at the next one, perhaps. Happy Yelping Phoenix.

I was in from Phoenix for the weekend, saw the event posted up on Yelp and decided to make an afternoon of it. What is normally a regularly scheduled farmers market is annually transformed into a full blown festival. With food eating contests, live bands, and excitement everywhere. I was aiming to join in on the pie eating contest, but arrived just a minute or two before it started and didn't get a chance to sign up in time. Next time ;-)  After the pie eating contest, I had some time so I introduced myself and chatted for a few minutes with Drew, the local Yelp Community Manager and a handful of other Yelp Locals. It was cool to meet you guys and congrats LJ on 4th place! Or was it 3rd, uh well. You beat the other 12 or so people on stage out to a "sweet" victory!  The location, Tivoli Village, was quite a spectacular venue. With stone work all around, just the sight of the restaurants and retail shops was worth the visit. We got to walk around, check out the different vendors selling anything from manly desserts, beef jerkey, hand made jewelry, fresh farmed vegetables, hummus, and much more too.  On the way out, I stopped by a mobile art studio and perused through a number of pieces from local artists. Not particularly interested in anything on display in the bus, the operator clued me in to the downtown art district, with tons of local antique shops and art studios. On the way out of town, we ended up going through and finding a couple of fun things to bring back home to Phoenix.  I'm a fan of farmers markets, local vendors, and artists too. If you have the chance, come by next year or to one of the normal market Saturdays and Happy Yelping!

Somebody blew up my phone last week with a group text about doing something. Thanks, thanks a lot. No really, thanks a lot, cause I probable wouldn't have ended up here otherwise. :-) I hopped on the scooter, pushed my way around the corner and found scooter (bike) parking at the bar next door. I did end up asking about a bike rack for their place and they said its on the way and should be up soon - they're only a month or so since opening day, so I guess you can't fault them for that ;-)  A handful of us stopped in for Happy Hour. With mixed drinks at $7 during HH, I had the bartender pour me "Something with Hendricks, but not too sweet." It was Christmas time after all and what a better drink than something that tastes like a Christmas Tree? I left the specifics up to them, I figured they'd know better what to mix together than I would. I ended up with something with lemon and mint, and pretty tasty at that!   After everyone arrived, we all ordered the $5 pork Ramen from the HH menu as well as the Asian chicken wings, both items delish, and both items worth coming back for during HH. I think the draft beers were $3 during HH and the total bill coming to like $60 after tax and tip, it was a reasonably priced dinner and drinks for four.  Their normal menu was a bit pricey for my taste, while I don't think I will aim here if it's not HH, you know I'll definitely be back for that Ramen, especially since I'm just a hop skip and a jump - or a scoot away.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, definitely come try their HH ramen - HH is 4-7pm (for the summer hours at least)!

I do so enjoy a great local craft brew, but they have none of that here, so I had to go to Angels Trumpet instead, booo.  As long as you're here though, you might just prop yourself up at the best craft cocktail bar in all of greater Phoenix. Rivaled by literally no one else in downtown, midtown, Scottsdale, the east valley and the west, the bartenders will craft you whatever your taste buds desire.  Menu, please, don't insult their knowledge of the darks, if that's what your into, but me, I usually stick to the lighter spirits. Go up to the bar, return the menu they might have just handed you, and tell them everything you love in a drink. Maybe it's the flavor of basil in a delicious gin drink. Perhaps it's passion fruit along side a tasty vodka. Maybe your flavor is tart, not sweet and with a kick of spice, or the best Manhattan you've ever had but you love them because the amazing orange flavors. Trust me, put down the menu and just tell em what you want out of a drink, you won't regret it, not for one second!  Oh, and if that flavor is beer, I do believe they have a couple taps, just don't expect anything crafty.   If you're feeling like you're on the outside whenever you come in here, it's probably because you are. Let me tell you a secret, but shhhhh, don't tell anyone else. Ask for their "secret menu" for a list of drinks and food items only available to the inside crowd here.   The ramen burger is delish, as is everything else I've tried here foodwise, but who exactly can remember everything I've had from the many visits to B&T?, certainly not I.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, I'm sure we'll run into each other at some point down the road, as long as your road brings you to B&T!   ...Obligatory shout out to Jason, he's my favorite bartender, but watch out girls, he's taken. I asked him for a crafty spin on my go to Titos with lime and he knocked it out of the park; it was tart, not sweet, effervescent, bubbly, and delicious, and I order it just about every time I'm there! :-)

If you're a local music fan, downtown Phoenix was your Mecca last night. When I say local, I don't mean the band that fills a room with 5 people, but the bands that bring along a hundred or so doting fans. There were also a few anchors that brought people out like The Neighborhood and Sir Mix-A-Lot.  Setup across 13 different venues in downtown Phoenix, such as Crescent  Ballroom, City Scape, Hard Rock Cafe, and Last Exit Live - something like 60 bands rocked the night until 2am. Music from hip hop, rap, folk, rock, electronic, indie, dance, singer/songwriter could be heard in 30-60 minute sets. Make your choices, or don't and just wing it. It was a fun night of music, hanging with friends, strolling downtown, dancing, and chillaxing and I can't wait for the next one!  FYI tickets sold out about 8pm ish. If this event happens again, buy your tickets early -- like I did. ;-)  Happy Yelping Phoenix! Time to get your groove on.

A recommendation from my pal Norm, always in good taste and never bad form. He always delivers with a solid five stars, so walk here or run or jump in your cars.  Couscous Express delivers phenomenal customer service and awesome food! We were seated, greeted, and before I could open the menu, I was chatting with my lady on how I hope they have hummus on the menu. I was jonesing for some of that garbanzo bean delight, I'm sure my hands were shaking from withdrawals; I've not had any in about two days and my home supply was depleted. No sooner then I had finished that thought, the waiter brought out some of the best tasting hummus I've had, and fresh out of the oven pita. Was this guy reading my mind, probably, their service is just that good. We ordered the beef couscous to share, which was a great idea because it was perfect sized for two 'small plate' eaters, but I totally could have killed that entire dish myself, and then some too. Oooh, it was so good!  After dining and sampling their house made date shake, I was assured by the waiter they had plenty more delicious food that he would love to serve me, especially their soup. I almost caved under the pressure, but I couldn't eat another bite; they sure do know how to make you feel like you're part of the family. Requesting my check, the waiter asked if we would like more hummus, more date shake, more anything, he is at our service. I'm pretty sure hat I replied with "OMG, I'm so full and every bite was fantastic, I couldn't possibly take one ore bite!"  I think I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm not a fan of dates, I've had them on a number of occasions and don't love them; more of a neither here nor there sort of thing for me. I'll probably give the date shake another try if I run into it again, but if you love dates, they've got one here to satisfy that craving.  Bring your friends, bring your family, bring your enemies too, if you're covering dinner at this spot, they'll change their mind about you. It's time to eat Moroccan food people, see you around and happy Yelping!!

Wow, there's a new kid on the block, but not all that is new means good, I almost am in shock at my experience when compared to other reviews and opinions I've read so far.  Maybe it's just Sunday's. The Sunday morning service was laughable at best, laugh because I didn't want to cry. I wasn't certain how they handle call aheads, or reservations, it was also a weekend brunch, so I attempted to call ahead to at least ask what the wait looked like. Two calls later and no answer, we were already there and parking, but upon entering the compound that is Ocotillo, I found the lady at the maitre d stand, with a phone just below her left elbow. (Seriously?)  I inquired as to the wait as I put the name in with her and was told just a few minutes, tables were being cleaned now. I guess "being cleaned" meant 30 minutes, I must have forgotten my English to English translator, silly me. I was unpleasantly surprised to find 6 or 7 open tables as I was getting seated, and the wait had stacked what appeared to be 4 more parties behind me. At this point my best guess was that there weren't enough staff for a weekend morning to handle guests demands.   I ordered the roast beef and potatoes hash, which came with a sunnyside egg, and after requesting the egg medium, the egg was way undercooked; about 3 minutes under. I tried the roast beef, which was chunks of tough beef, overly chewy and super fatty and the potatoes were large cubes about 1.5inch by 1.5inch, this was not a hash. I had about two bites before deciding to give it back to the server.   As I returned the hash, the server replied with a friendly, can I get you something else in stead, which was kind of her, trying to appease my dislike with a different dish, was helpful on her part but I was short on time and wasn't interested in something else at that point.  The rest of my party all independently came to the conclusion that their meals weren't so amazing as to spend the $$ they're charging here, and the wait was over the top. One of the people in the party tried to order the breakfast chimichanga, which they were out of. Their second choice; scrambled farm eggs, was quite underwhelming. Our party also ordered the bread pudding bowl, which was neither bread pudding, nor was it in a bowl. It was tasty though, and had they called it loaf of gooey cinnamon bread on top of roasted apples with cream, it would have been spot on.  Being as objective as possible after such a poor experience, the server was friendly and tried to resolve my complaint by allowing me to order a different meal and the bread pudding bowl tasted good, but caveat emptor to the person who orders it expecting bread pudding.  I can't say that I'll be back soon, but they do have a to go coffee bar, so if you drink coffee maybe you can grab and go from there on your way to work.  Happy yelping!

Fresh, fast Mediterranean style food. I can't say I'd choose this spot over table service, but it seems good enough for a quick stop or a lunch. You tell them what you want, double meat? There's an option for that, top it with hummus, tatziki, jalapeños, peprocini, cucumber and more. They cater too. I'd stop in again if I lived or worked in the area :-)  Happy yelping! ... Gilbert, Mesa, or wherever I am. ;-)

First impressions are a bit*h. Sadly, the impression I received from My Tea was one of ignorance. Ignored, overlooked, forgotten and right in front of three employees behind the counter. 'Twas a Friday with one customer in line ahead of me. After waiting a minute or two it was my turn. I waited at the register for the cashier to say hi, and waited and waited and waited. There were three employees, all bustling about doing something important I guess. I waited. Patiently as I could. One of the employees looked my way and gave me a smile, a smile, a "please don't talk to me" sort of smile and then went back about her busy work. I waited. It was a good five minutes of waiting past the sad smile, any acknowledgement would have been acceptable here, the bare minimum of "sorry for the wait, just a moment while I do my busy work" would have kept me waiting longer. Alas, I waited no longer. All in all it was about 7 minutes of waiting at the register and I chose to leave without any tea and I fear they'll never know why. I imagine they're thinking "he probably decided to have no tea I guess", "maybe he changed his mind". I did change my mind actually, I decided to go to the other shaved ice spot just a mile down the street.   Perhaps I'll come in again at some point, perhaps not, but like I said, first impressions are a bit*h
