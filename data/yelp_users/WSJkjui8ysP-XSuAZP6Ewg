This is our favorite Chinese restaurant. The food is delicious and the price is right. They are fast and always quite friendly.

We can't rave enough about working with Phil and Gwen! Most of our early correspondence was with Gwen- she was prompt, professional, and oh so sweet. Phil did the actual officiating of our wedding, and we couldn't be more happy with him. We met before the ceremony, so he could get a feel of who we are and how we wanted our wedding officiated. When the day of the wedding came, he conducted the wedding in the exact way we had hoped. He has such a calming nature and seemed so invested in our relationship, even though he didn't know us all that well! Our guests raved about the flow and strength of his message. He is also funny and witty without being over the top. We highly recommend this wonderful husband and wife team! Thank you Phil and Gwen for making our special day perfect!

The staff are always friendly and work with you to get exactly what you're after since their menu is pretty small. They will make anything you ask! We love the coffee and always feel a little happier after a morning trip to Dutch Bros!

We have used the services of 3D (Del and family) a couple of times for carpet cleaning. He and his wife are so sweet and professional. Their work is excellent and I am always happy with the outcome. They even take the time to spray carpet freshener after the cleaning. I am so happy to support a small family centered company that does such great work. I will undoubtably be using this company for future jobs! Thank you Del and Vikki!

I purchased a Living Social Deal and have been trying to call to schedule. The message that plays immediately when calling says " the person you are trying to reach is not accepting calls". Not sure how to reach them if the number on the voucher and on Yelp isn't working. Will review again if I ever get them to come to clean?!

We used a Groupon to purchase a 3 hour house cleaning. Our cleaning gal, Nikki, showed up on time and was so sweet. She even tolerated my almost one year old checking her out and following her around. She worked efficiently and did a great job. Also, Nikki let me know I would be automatically enrolled for a cleaning every 4 weeks. I didn't know the company automatically set you up that way (as many others writing reviews stated). I really appreciated her letting me know, so I could change this setting. I had no problem using the app to cancel the recurring appointments.   I don't really love the feel of the lack of personal customer service with this company. Also, they are a bit over priced. The Groupon price was reasonable, but their monthly charge was more than we are willing to pay.  Thank you Nikki for the great service. If we use this service again, we would definitely choose you! Her customer service did make up for the lack of company customer service.
