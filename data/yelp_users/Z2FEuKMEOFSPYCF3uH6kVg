Sheldon! Your services were awesome tonight! I forgot what my margarita with the extra random shot was called, so I'll name it the Netflix and Chill margarita. Anyways that was amazeballs. My filet, amazeballs. Enjoyed good company from my amazing co workers, and we were even sang to. I love this place!  Sheldon deserves an immediate promotion. Unless he makes more in tips with less drama, then do what you do Sheldon.   Five stars because I've had tequila and my steak was insane and Sheldon was a total boss. I'll come back maybe. Phoenix is a happening spot!  Please mail me some bread and cinnamon butter. K thanks. #drunkyelping

My 100th review! I waited for something truly epic to come along. Here it is. The Barrio Cafe! I drove up to see my bio dad and his wife. They decided to meet at the cafe because they said that they have the best food ever. I was skeptical because I practically live in Mexico, so who has the best food? Tucson has the best food! Just kidding.   I get there and they're packed at 2pm. That's saying something. We had some somewhat slow service, but the guy was super nice so I'm not docking anything.   We get the guacamole first. It has  pomegranate in it or something like that. What?!?! No. This was the best dang guac ever. I mean ever. I ordered the carne asada tacos. It was served with fries and two very unique sauces that I didn't think to ask about. My step mom had this cheese stuff and this corn stuff. I had a bite of the corn and it was incredible. The tacos were awesome.   We had an excellent visit. This was a perfect choice in dining for the occasion. We did end up putting our lady Guadalupe on the floor because we needed more room for food. I'm definitely not religious, but I hit a huge traffic jam on the way home. Next time Lady Guadalupe can stay on the table I guess. I give this place a million stars. One million.   I'm coming to Phoenix for training next month. I'm ready to gain some weight! I hope you're ready for me Barrio folks!

We stayed here for our wedding weekend. My beautiful step mom actually got us the room as our wedding gift. Everything was perfect. Room service, amazing front desk agents, helpful valets, you name it, they did it. Just off the strip, so there's definitely the Las Vegas experience, but secluded enough to be able to enjoy quiet moments when necessary. We had a suite in tower 3. The views were perfect. The ambiance was perfect. Everything about his hotel was absolutely fantastic. They even allowed me an extra night in my room because my flight home was delayed. How awesome was that?   Next time I will have to visit the day spa. :)

I have the opportunity to stay in the hotel while I'm on business a couple of times a month. I've had breakfast twice and tonight I ordered dinner.   Tech specs:   1) The western omelet: it was fine. Better than I would expect at say...a Denny's, but not what I would expect for the price. It's $8.95-ish and it was just okay. Nothing great.   2) the corned beef breakfast skillet. Meh. It was pretty good. Just good. Nothing special. My over medium eggs were cooked perfectly.   3) The Ribeye. This is a $20 steak that comes with a potato and veggies. Served with toast. The steak was cooked okay, but no seasoning. The veggies were the highlight, and the baked potato was old and black inside. Surprisingly at this price point a salad isn't included.   My biggest pain point with this place is that the service is hit or miss, with miss being the trend. No hospitality, no recommendations, the breakfast server was rude and made a big deal about drinks not being within the limit of our vouchers. I need to note that the gentleman morning server was pretty nice and efficient. The service tonight wasn't great. I ordered a steak to go, I'm a guest in the hotel. It's a complete pain in the butt to cut the steak with plasticware.   I do have a constant to compare this to. I worked for Interstate Hotels and Resorts part time on the weekend when I was younger. If anything that makes me a little more forgiving when it comes to service and food quality. This place is convenient if you're staying here and don't want to venture out. It has the potential to be amazing.

Edit ****   Oh my gosh the server just made it SO AWKWARD. Like awkward enough for us to discuss avoiding her for weeks at a time. All I did was simply ask if the same complimentary coffee for hotel guests is the same coffee that they try to charge us $2 for in the dining room. It is, so why would I not walk three steps outside to get my coffee that's included in my hotel stay?! After I asked that, she took my order all cranky like and didn't even bother asking if I want toast.   Here is the thing. If you don't like working in food service, stop working in food service. Don't treat people who have a common sense question like crap. The fact that you people charge for coffee is absolutely ridiculous.

Took a ride on the back of the bike with a friend and decided on this spot based on word of mouth from friends.   I felt somewhat out of place with my helmet hair and all, but the service was friendly and quick. Not overbearing and perfect for hilarious conversation. :D   I ate the blue corn pancakes with agave syrup. Dude. I'm not really a corn person. I mean corn is okay, but it's...corn. These were amazing. I can't really speak to what my friend had because it was gone in like three minutes (gains food bruh) and I totally forgot what they had.   All in all it was a pleasant experience, and next time I'm up in the area I may visit again. :)
