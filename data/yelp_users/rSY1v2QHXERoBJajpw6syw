Never coming back! Two guys and both just wasted my time, I placed my order twice and they still couldn't complete it. It's coffee, and all I asked for was just creme. They charged me for someone else's order and I was the only one in the store. Uugghhh ! I walked out without my morning fix empty handed and frustrated.  unfortunately I'm considering returning after 6 years to my Saturday coffee from Starbucks

So far service exceeds my expectations. server is very attentive, and all I ordered was my beer. Fresh rolls and frosted glass = Great start

Hands down this place has one of the best bartenders ever. Remembers most of his bar customers and gets their drinks before ordering. That's talent

Best (draft) happy hour and amazing atmosphere. I am here 2 days a week for the awesome pizza and the beer. Also, great place to come read and drink when you have nothing to do.

Holy hell, the wait to just sign in was terrible. I was second in line to just sign in. Not a good start. Finally got seats (not picky ones) and our server didn't show up until we asked for some service for simple coffee. Please work a tad better on your service.

We had a going away party at OKRA yest.  The staff at OKRA was remarkable. The manager Maureen did a phenomenal job in accommodation all our needs. She interacted with us and always made sure we were all having a good time. OKRA was definitely the perfect place for any special occasion. We had an amazing time and will return. Thank you guys so much!

Not what I expected! Very disappointed on my burger... Yelp had a suggestion for the portobello mushroom burger, which I chose but it did not meet expectations!
