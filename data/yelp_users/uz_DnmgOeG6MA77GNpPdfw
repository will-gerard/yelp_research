When stocking, during business hours, maintaining safe passage for those whom are handicapped, or in the event of a fire should be paramount.  When a customer tells a front end "supervisor" person that "hey, I found this frozen product in the wrong isle, and its obviously warm now" the supervisor should not, then accuse me of not returning the item to the frozen department before I let it thaw... That its "my problem".  Tried to explain a second time.  She persisted, that I should buy the product that I allow to thaw.  Reminded her I did the right thing ... Uggg However, security was super nice.  My car got hit in the lot.  He assisted until police arrived.

Loved the food.  Service was super friendly.  Family owned and operated,  and really enjoyed the taco salad, the cheese crisp.   Good rellenos!

Found the problems that others had missed.  Was painless, fantastic, his office called to make sure I was okay the following day, and make sure I understood my diagnosis and treatment plan.  I have since sent multiple people to him, all who have rave reviews.  Who wants to have the kind of tests he has to perform?  Nobody.  But he possibly saved my life. Dr. yatin Patel is definitely the GI Doc I will forever be grateful for!

Love the variety.  Wish there was more peanut flavor to the dishes that call for it.  Lacking a little lustre in the sesame department as well.  Defiantly not authentic Chinese.    But decent fast food.  Prices were higher than I expected.

Their house pizza is a must!  The fresh Mozzarella, the olives... All make a perfect bite!  The salad was good ,  And save room for the cannolis!

Of course, had our original, brick oven as the menu suggests (with bacon and kalamata olives) We also had the 1/2 deep dish pepperoni and Kalamata.  Also relish!     The staff was super friendly.   The aroma coming from the kitchen is how I imagine my pups feel, when I am preparing a roast!  (Lol)  Drool and saliva might ensue..... But this I say.... The wait is never very long.   Every bite is delish.   Now we are waiting for our cannoli.... It better not disappoint!  Haha! While my hubby and son enjoyed the cannoli, I am old school... They were too sweet, and not nearly as flaky as they should be.  This saddened me.  (Petty, but its my opinion , this jaded Italian... Lol)

I could live on 5 guys fries!  I live the food, in general, but the fries are my favorite.  Being raised in Canada, I love that there is vinegar available!  Keep it up!  Thanks!

Let's see.... Another success story:  sent some folks to rehab, from the ER in chandler.  They were there for a traumatic experience, and asked me where to go for good filling yumminess, and told them what I like, what friends have liked.  I ran into them today , back at the hospital, and they said you all were perfect.  They were from some distance away.  They tied one on, had great food. . and actually plan on coming back before their journey home ...  WAY TO GO REHAB BURGER THERAPY!

Hey!  Wanted to stop by and say Thank you from the bottom of our full bellies!  Last Wednesday night, I brought a friend from Colorado to rehab, as part of her journey.  She was here on business, and coming there was, as always a great visit and vibe.  We were chilled on the patio... But the staff scrambled to heat up the patio.  My guest had the pesto pasta, I had a bacon cheeseburger, subbing for blue cheese crumbles.  As always... You didn't leave room for any disappointment.  Thank you!  See you again soon!

Sharing!   Was an excellent experience my first visit was last week.  I was looking for something very particular.  The young lady that night, was very knowledgeable, took me to the product, etc.   How nice!   Dear owners: keep her!  She is definitely an asset!   (I didn't think to ask her name)
