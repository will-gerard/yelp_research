As always great service and food! Went for date night on a Friday and was seated quickly and with an amazing waiter! Had the spinach artichoke cheese fondue, chicken in court bouillon and the strawberry shortcake chocolate fondue...All of it was AMAZING!! I also had the sailor's punch which was nice and fruity. The total for two with drinks was just under $100 so it's not a cheap night out...but definitely worth it every once in a while :D

Finally an authentic taco shop in AZ!!! Reminds me of home sweet home (chicago). All the staples are there...2 corn tortillas, cabbage, red salsa, limes....they even have ground beef...A rarity in these parts. Couldn't be happier :D

The employees here are unbelievable.  Literally watched one wrap up my burrito by squeezing out all of the sour cream then rolling it in it...plus my friends margarita took seriously 5 minutes to make.

Ah-mazing!!!! First time eating Iranian food and definitely won't be the last :) The bread with herbs was amazing. We got a platter with chicken, filet and ground beef...the portions were HUGE. Definitely more for three people. Drinks were mediocre but strong. Will definitely be back again soon!

Came here late night for cocktails and a bite. Loved the dumplings.  Beef skewers were good but kinda marbled. Watermelon flavored martini was bomb but could use a little more alcohol. Overall a great experience!

I cannot even explain how much I loved this place. Between the food and beer list I couldn't be happier. Had the chicken pot pie and died over it. Definitely not the most comfy seating arrangements but over all really great experience!

If you are over the age of 60 and only here for 3 months out of the year, this place is perfect for you. Literally, these condos are filled with vacation rental units in which people move in and out every other month. Do not be fooled by the cheap rent rates...you get what you pay for. The management staff is good but with the HOA being involved, they have no real power to manage the property. If you have children or pets, look elsewhere.

I cannot express how great the staff has been with my aggressive chihuahua and my hyper dachshund. I was told I'd be traveling for work for the better part of December and after have been through multiple sitters and boarding facilities I was praying this one would work. They were so patient and kind to my fear aggressive chihuahua that he was actually excited to go back! There aren't enough stars to express how grateful I am to the lovely staff!

I paid $9 for a chicken caesar salad and a cup of soup. They were both really generic and way over priced. I wouldn't eat that chicken again if you paid me. Reminded me of that disgusting pre cooked chicken that comes in a plastic bag at the grocery store for salads. Not coming here again.

Fun place for a lively night out. Very mixed crowd with all different age groups.  Dance floor is tiny and food is mediocre but staff is very nice and drinks are reasonable. They also have a decent happy hour menu. Last time we went on a Saturday and received a free bottle of bubbly (see photos). Overall pretty fun, just make sure to wear proper shoes :)

The menu is not nearly descriptive enough. I ordered a chickpea Mediterranean salad expecting falafel on a bed of lettuce. What I got was curried chickpea cakes on swiss chard and kale...disgusting. Not to mention two salads and lemonade cost $46. Never coming here again.

This is my new favorite place. Got a few appetizers including the pretzel fondue, artichoke hummus and zucchini fritters. The pretzel fondue is what dreams are made of...seriously.  Drinks were well crafted and worth the higher price! Hummus was a bit disappointing but everything else was ah-mazing!!!

Wanted to try a local place and heard good things. The place is modest with a friendly staff. For the love of jesus, if you can't take heat, do not eat here! The posole was amazing and you NEED to try the homemade tortillas! A bit different than the posole I'm used to but this is a new mexican style restaurant so it's a bit off from the mexican food I'm used to from chicago. Overall a good experience and will definitely come again!!

Awesome pulled pork...fabulous creamed corn....cornbread was a little dry....Mac n cheese did not need the jalepenos. We split a three meat platter and it was perfect portion size. GREAT service and cool atmosphere. Will be back here again for happy hour :)

The two star is ONLY because I love hooters food...seriously the b*tchiest waitress I have ever encountered. The place was empty and she didn't even seem like she wanted a table! Will not be back to this location...ever.

The meatballs, oh the meatballs. I can't even explain how amazing they are. Mac n cheese...not so much. Had almost a wine or vinegar flavor. Burger was decent and HORRIBLE ranch dressing. The 4 star was for the meatballs and hopes that their meals are more along the same line. Will come again for a dinner or brunch.

Definitely not impressed with the quality of the food here. I stopped in before catching a movie and wanted something simple. Got a turkey sandwich and the cheese soup...Both mediocre at best. The bread was not lightly toasted, rather soaked in oil from the grill. I got stomach pains from the grease about a half hour into the movie.  The turkey tasted super processed and was a strange hue of pink..far from what I was expecting. The soup was really bitter..A sign of too much beer in it. My friend got the mac and cheese, which was much better so if I go again I'll probably only get that.

The drinks were great but strong, food was either very bland or very spicy, ambiance was a nice outdoor lounge feel. The Scorpion bowl was a good drink but the bowl it came in looked like it was bought in a back alley tourist shop in chinatown...see pics

Literally you cannot get a better gym experience for the price.  Keep in mind this is not the place for gym rats or people looking for serious amenities. This is a place where you can always find a machine and get the job done quickly without worrying about what you look like while doing it. I've never seen anyone hunting for a date and never felt uncomfortable getting my sweat on.
