So here's the good, the bad and the ugly.  First and foremost, she's an outside of the box doctor - and that's hard to find. Someone who will go the distance regardless if you're a textbook case or not.   Dr. Shafran ... words can't describe her bedside manner, but once you get past her rough exterior, she's like a little puppy - soft, cute & cuddly.   The staff... well, some days are good - some not so good.  Overall- I refer everyone. Along with that I let them know that she's going to yell at you but instead of feeling insulted... laugh it's worth it.

There's nothing not to love...  It's rare to find a place that's so unusual in the middle of Phoenix.   Everything is good and they have these french pancakes that I can't resist getting each time I go. That's a problem because their pizza is so good... So now I figure I'll still get the french pancakes and take a pizza home for dinner.  I just like the whole atmosphere. Very city like with tight cramped rows of grocery items and gifts along with tables scattered about to sit and enjoy the weather.   Sandwiches, Breakfast, Pizza and don't forget the most beautiful decorated cakes I've ever seen. I have yet to try them because they appear dangerous to my thighs.

Nick's happens to be a few doors down from my business... very dangerous!! Literally, everything is so good. They bake their bread fresh everyday and it melts in your mouth.  Lunch - I suggest a sandwich on their french bread. I personally love their hot chicken sandwich with balsalmic dressing, melted cheese and seasoned chicken, grilled onions... need I go on - hmmm I'm hungry.  or the greek salad with sliced chicken...  Dinner- This is where you eat the foccacia bread. Now when you're dieting and not allowed carbs - just eat the tops & save your cheat calories for the chicken marsala with penne pasta.   Don't forget dessert - The tiramisu.  Enjoy

Love this place!  Someone comes in from out of town - I take them to the Persian Room.  It's your birthday? Let's go to the Persian Room Graduation - Holiday party - bad day... you get the idea.  People think you have to dress up, but I've seen it all from fancy dresses to laid back shorts (I'm in the shorts!)  I suggest the chicken filet kabob, hummus with the pita bread - just my opinion.

I love this place!!   I've been all around town to many yoga studios and this is one of my favorites. I actually drive from Scottsdale to Tempe just to take classes from one of my favorite teachers - Kat. She teaches this body ball rolling class that's designed to release your body's tight spots and trust me when I say that you'll find plenty.  My other favorite class - Jim's flow. His energy is calm - peaceful and he always has these wise and insightful words that come out just when you need to hear them. You'll get a good workout in his classes, both mind and body.  A drop in class is only $12 ($10 for students) whereas other studios are $16- $25, and if you buy a package of classes it brings the price down even lower.  Enjoy...

This company has been around for many years and is franchised throughout the country. We hired one of their care-givers for 24 hour care from Monday - Thursday. We were told that she had experience working with alzheimers patients and for that reason we felt confident leaving my father with her. Thank goodness we have cameras set up around the house! I know that you need to give a person time to get comfortable with the routine and therefore we have to give some slack if they don't follow all the daily tasks right away but this caregiver, what she did was outrageous.   Her second week with us we see (from cameras) that at my fathers bed time she stood in the hallway, said goodnight and went upstairs to bed while leaving him in the kitchen. She didn't make sure that he was in his pajamas, had brushed his teeth, and that he was in bed - she left him standing in the kitchen fully clothed not knowing what to do. He was walking around confused for at least 5 minutes before he went into his room. We called her and yelled at her to get back downstairs and put him to bed. So then she goes into his room and asks what he's doing, why he's not in bed  "you told me you were going straight to bed" that's what she says to a man with alzheimer's. He said "I had things I had to do" which she replied "that's not normal. When you say you're going to bed - you go to bed". She continues to tell him that what he's doing isn't normal - does she know what alzheimer's is??? Uh - it's a given that he's going to do things that aren't normal, that's why we hire caregivers to look after him.   We let her go. We couldn't believe what she did - how she put him in danger by not watching him. What's even more upsetting is that Brightstar did nothing. They still haven't returned our phone calls or helped us find someone new. When we called the owner of this franchise - Steve - to tell him what happened and that his company never called us he was dismissive and said "what do you want from me?". He wants to see the video of what happened before talking to me further. It's not a problem because I saved the tape but I don't see why I should have to prove myself to him. An apology and "what can I do to help you" would have been the right thing for him to do.

I was reading the reviews for La Pizzetta and just had to add my thoughts. I've tried a few pizza places but I can't get enough of La Pizzetta's Margherita pizza. I consider this to be more like a boutique style pizza place. Their pies are very thin and very light which is what I think makes this fantastic pie so good. I recently tried POMO pizza because someone recommended it as having a great wood fired pizza. I couldn't eat it. It was too cheesy, too heavy and too salty - not for me.  I can't comment on the rest of the food at this point because I can't seem to imagine eating anything but their pizza. As for the atmosphere - it can use some work. Just know that when you do decide to try it that you're going for the food.   FYI - we often order 2 pies to go and I have a tip for those that also take out ... we noticed that they would stack the pizza boxes on top of one another causing the bottom pie to hold in too much heat which resulted in a mushy crust. Easily corrected - when we order we request that they don't stack the boxes on top of one another and haven't had a problem since.
