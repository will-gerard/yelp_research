I love this place. You pick whatever meats, veggies, and noodles you want. Then they grill it up for you. I usually take it to go they charge by the pound. It's enough for 3 meals. If you eat there it is buffet style and you can't take leftovers. Good food!  I went to Lai, Lai after I started my review and they changed EVERYTHING! No more buffet, or Mongolian grill. They only offer eat in or take out Chinese food. They do have great taste, but we are very disappointed to find out about the change.

I love this place. This was my second visit. Gel manicure and reg Spa Pedicure. Prices are very reasonable. Family owned and operated. Today was a Saturday so they had their 2 boys there. My 3 year old didn't want to leave after playing with their 5 year old and his toys. It was a nice visit, and I expected less since I had my busy little one with me.

I've used Cox for internet service since 2004. But We decided against our better judgement to go ahead and do the bundle thing with the phone and cable and internet. It made my bill go up from $35 to $131 per month. So it is expensive, fine whatever. The cable box was constantly freezing up, especially during the best part of any show! It would tile up, freeze completely or just turn off for 10 minutes to reboot. They came out 3 different times. They replaced the box two different times and the third guy said he found voltage in my cable wire!?! So they fixed it, and it still isn't what I expect to get for paying so much for. So WE QUIT! I called them to cancel 1/5/12 and turns out SOMEONE FAILED to tell me I was signing a CONTRACT! I swear that is the reason I chose COX over Dish or Direct TV. Because I was under the impression that I could cancel If I wanted to.  SO I told him FINE charge it I don't want this crap, it's not worth it. But I told him "I wanted to hear me on a previous call agree to any 2 year agreement." So He had me on hold for 10 additional minutes and told me they would waive the fee. I am happy it turned out that way. But I almost wasn't so lucky! Watch out for these guys! Don't let them walk on you. Happy New Year! =P

I do not recommend this nail salon. I had gel nails done with white tips. They were so bad that I went back the next day to have them redone. They still weren't as good as they should be but I just said I'd never go back. I do have a picture, but I'm not sure it shows how bad they were. The white tips lines were not strait.

I gave this place another chance since I read the other reviews and learned they were under new management. I had a French Gel manicure. Great work. There can be a long wait if all employees are working on someone. But that is normal I would think.

Brand new facility. Very clean and very tasty food. I love the Hibachi grill and testing out different sushi.
