My husband and I visited the Arizona Science Center two weeks ago on a Saturday to use a Groupon for the DaVinci exhibit. We like museums. So why only two stars?   Parking was confusing. Apparently you can get parking validated if you park in a specific lot, but there weren't signs or directions to let us know that. We parked across the street next to the Diamondbacks stadium for not an obscene amount of money, but considering we are in Phoenix and not San Francisco, it was excessive. Plus there was some other event going on so we had to drive up several floors and there were annoying cones blocking off most of the available parking. WTF!   Then we got to the lobby. The line was waaayyyy worse than the MVD. And the lobby is also pure concrete (think bomb shelter), so if you're trying to pull up a Groupon or something on your phone... give up. The cashier was kind enough to pull up our Groupons on her computer. The line was also complete with more than its fair share of impatient, screaming children who needed their naps.   The actual exhibit was interesting. The only way to get from the ticket counter to the exhibit was a small, slow, in-the-corner elevator. We looked through a few of the permanent exhibits, and it was ok, but nothing special.

I stopped by here for a few quick things during a weekday at lunch time. I didn't have to wait in line at all, parking is easy and plentiful, the store is well organized and prices are clearly marked, and store associates are friendly and helpful. No complaints here. Bring your coupons :)

Employees are nice enough, but seemingly simple transactions take forever since everything requires manager approval. Definitely not a good place to bring a baby who might not be super patient. All sorts of complicated ways to save money to try to make up for how much higher prices are than at Target or Amazon.

I love fondue, but I'm not coming back to this restaurant.   I had dinner here on a Wednesday at 6:30pm and was really disappointed by how rushed the experience felt. The place couldn't have been more than half full, but corporate must have told them to turn the tables more quickly. Our server didn't really come check on how we were doing, but every time he arrived I felt like a kid who hadn't done my homework - I don't know what I want for my next course! I just started eating what's in front of me. I told him twice to give us more time to decide, but I should have been more assertive.   The part of dinner I had looked forward to most was the blackberry lemonade, and that was a fail. I wanted nonalcoholic and should have specified. The server could have clarified or noticed I didn't drink it and asked if I needed something else. Instead we didn't have time to talk about it until after the bill so I paid $8 for a drink I couldn't drink. I should have insisted he take it off the bill, and he should have offered but, like I said, he was trying to get us out of there ASAP and we were gone by 7:15pm (not exactly closing time).   I go out to dinner for a relaxing evening of good food and conversation, and everyone was polite, but the speed of the experience made me feel unwelcome.

I came in on a weekday late afternoon since I had a coupon for a free panty and $10 off a bra. The salespeople were helpful and friendly but not pushy, which I really appreciated!! Usually it seems like Victoria's Secret sales associates are always trying to upsell and convince me to buy things I don't want, so this is now my favorite location, even though the mall it's in isn't super nice. The associates all appeared to be bilingual (spanish) also. I will definitely be back!

Our experience here was a train wreck. Complete incompetence. On the plus side, The store is relatively clean, competitively priced, and no one was rude, but picking up the order we placed online (that should have been waiting for us) was a scavenger hunt.   First, the customer service person told us to go to the computers department, but on our way there, we saw a sign for networking and figured our router might be there. The employee in that department told us our router would be at the cashier but the modem would be in the computers department (not together for some reason even though we ordered them together). At the computers department, we couldnt find anyone to help us, so we went to the cashier. When we got to the cashier (after waiting in line), she was confused and needed a manager to tell her that our order was waiting back in the computers department. We waited for her to walk back and get it. We were surprised when she asked for a credit card even though we had entered that already online. Apparently they don't charge the card until you pick it up (in case you don't have the patience for the chaos, perhaps?). Lastly, the cashier told us they didn't have bags when we asked her to bag our purchased items. We managed to convince her to put each item in its own small plastic bag. Far from ideal, but we managed to eventually get out of there with what we needed.

I LOVE Trader Joes. They have awesome products you can't find anywhere else. And better prices on lots of things than at other stores. A whole watermelon for $3.49? Yes, please!!  I stopped by for a few things on a lunch break. There were lines to check out (are there ever not lines to check out at Trader Joes?), but the cashier was friendly and efficient.   I love that Trader Joes is small and well-organized enough that you don't have to walk for miles to compare prices on a simple pantry staple like I find myself doing at massive supermarkets like Fry's or Safeway (grrr!).

If you need something cleaned, KEEP LOOKING.  They destroyed something expensive and after initially promising to pay for me to replace the items, strung me along for months before I finally managed to hunt down the manager and learn that they'll refund my money but they won't replace the $500 of stuff they destroyed. I wouldn't be nearly so angry if they'd acted professionally and treated me with respect, but they wasted a lot of my time by ignoring my repeated requests for an update. The manager made no attempt to contact me after initially promising to send me a check for the replacement cost of the items.   I don't normally write such negative reviews, and I generously gave them more than ample opportunity to correct the problem. They definitely earned the one-star rating.

A few days ago was my first time at El Pollo Loco. I wanted to check it out since my friend had recommended the food. And it was delish!!   I went through the drive through on a weekday evening around 10:50pm (10 mins before they close). I'm always nervous about going to places that are about to close since I expect the people to be in a hurry to get me out of there, but even through the drive though, the person was super helpful! He gave advice on what people generally like since I hadn't been there before. He let me get a bottle of water instead of a fountain drink without throwing a fit or overcharging me. And, since they were about to close, he gave me lots of extra corn cake, which I have to say is pretty much the most delicious thing ever. I am obviously now a huge fan. I got the mango something salad (awesome). My husband got the chicken avocado burrito (even more awesome). No more Taco Bell for me! They've even given Chipotle a run for their money, and I'm typically a huge Chipotle fan.

There have to be other places that sell balloons, right?  It took a very long hour to get 12 simple helium balloons. There was a long line the entire hour I was in the store. I commented to the people working and they said it was actually slower than they expected to be with graduations this time of year which makes it seem even more stupid that it was only the manager and one employee working that day.   The manager inflated balloons really loudly which made my son cry even though I saw later that he very easily could have inflated them without the super loud popping noise. I guess he's just an asshole. I had to wait a really long time for the balloons I wanted to be inflated, since they messed it up the first time. After I was done, they made me wait in another super long line to pay. I paid extra for the balloons to last longer, and only half of them actually lasted as long as promised. They were out of stock of almost every happy birthday balloon. I heard someone ask about party invitations they were out of and the manager said to come back on Monday (I was there on a Thursday).   Two stars instead of one because Madyson (cashier, not the store manager) was nice.

We met friends here for drinks on a Saturday night after a friend recommended this place and we saw the fabulous reviews. It did not disappoint.   Service was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. My husband asked for a beer recommendation based on other beers he likes and the server made a great suggestion that he ended up loving. I had the sparkling sauvignon blanc which to me tasted like overpriced champagne. Our friend ordered the only Riesling on the menu and really enjoyed it. The server was kind enough to let us order a pb&j from the kids menu, and it came with a generous portion of apple slices, grapes, and potato chips.   I liked the ambience and decorations. Our friend thought the music was a little sleepy but there were at least a few songs that I really liked. I'd like to go back for lunch sometime since they have a nice selection of salads and paninis and $5 glasses of wine before 5pm.

Very clean, staff is friendly. I only bought a salad for lunch (southwest quinoa salad), but I liked it so much that I took a picture of the ingredients so I can try to replicate it at home. I just signed up for their rewards card, too. It's not the biggest grocery store in the world, but it has the basics.

I showed up around 4:30pm on a Wednesday for a mani pedi and had to wait for maybe 5 minutes. I was a little nervous since I had the oldest woman in the salon assigned to me (see someone else's review), but I thought she did just fine. I'll admit I'm not the world's pickiest customer, but the massage chair was awesome, water temperature was perfect, and probably my favorite part - they didn't keep obnoxiously trying to upsell me! If you've every gotten a normal regular non-gel non-acrylic manicure, you probably know what it's like to be asked every few minutes, by a few different people, if you want gel. And it gets annoying quickly having to keep saying what you want and feel like they're not listening and/or disappointed by the answer. The color selection met my needs. She did some callous removal/exfoliation without charging me extra. 5 or 6 days later, the pedicure still looks perfect. The manicure looks predictably beat up since I didn't get gel and I use my hands a lot.   I agree with other reviewers that it doesn't look fancy or nice from the outside. And the inside ambiance is definitely not north Scottsdale - it could use a little work. But I paid less for a mani-pedi plus tip than I often pay for just a pedicure before tip, so that makes me a very happy customer :D  p.s. Bring cash. There's a fee to pay with credit/debit.

I'd been wanting to try Five Guys for years and finally got around to it. Definitely a better burger than your average fast food joint.   The staff was super helpful and friendly since we told him we hadn't been there before. We got hamburgers, iced tea, and fries. We got the regular size fries, and small would probably have been sufficient since it was huge. The fries were really good, greasy enough but not nasty. The burgers were yummy, too. Friendly, clean, and tasty.

I came to the free Sunday morning community class with Meghan and had a good time. There were 15 people in class, which fit comfortably in the room, although 20 or 25 might have been really tight. The space is clean and well decorated with lots of props and free water and tea. It seemed a little weird that the bathroom was right off the back of the yoga room, but it was convenient for the students who needed a restroom break during class. Meghan was very welcoming, clear in her instructions, and encouraging of us to be present in the moment, which I loved. It was a gentle, somewhat slow paced class that didn't get me sweaty.   They have several other free classes during the week, although the prices are some of the most affordable I've seen in the area already. They also collect canned food for a local food pantry and give a discount off class fee when you contribute a food item. It's a really nice little space and community where anyone could feel comfortable to begin or grow a yoga practice.

Oh wow, go hungry. Not like me who started full and left almost sick. It's so worth it - don't stop eating!   We went around 8pm on a Saturday so of course the line was way out the door. Flavors seemed pretty standard and not a massive selection. I got a sundae with chocolate and vanilla ice creams, chocolate chip cookie, hot fudge, and whipped cream. The hubs got a s'mores freezie (which is like a blizzard). The warm marshmallow fluff on the snores is AMAZING. But be prepared with your napkins... We probably could have shared but yeah no. Back patio was pretty packed but we found a place to sit easily anyway.   I'd do it again. Maybe I'll try the peanut butter ice cream next time. With 1/2 a peanut butter cookie and chocolate covered pretzels. Yeah, I think so.

Smashburger is pretty good overall. Better than Five Guys, although I wish it were a little closer to where I live!  I've been twice - once to this location and once to another, both times with my husband. The first time, we got fries, he got the bacon cheeseburger (which he raved about and I tried a bite to confirm that it is in fact delicious). I got the black bean burger, and it was a little spicy for my wimpy tastes. It does say spicy in the name I guess... The second time, I got chicken with cucumber and goat cheese. I liked it, but my husband loved it. He got a bacon ranch avocado burger, which was yummy but super greasy and the avocado wasn't ripe enough. But the amazing Oreo milkshake more than made up for it. It cost around $18-19 for two sandwiches and the milkshake (no fries or other drinks).   Every employee I've interacted with at Smashburger has been friendly, polite, professional, just good people overall. I don't eat meat often, but if I'm craving a burger, this is a good place to go.

This place is amazing. I spent a really long time working with Rebecca today - she got me outfitted in new running shoes, socks, sport bra, shorts, and shirt. Like all the other reviewers say, the customer service is amazing!!! She measured my feet, have me advice on how to improve my form, videotaped me running in each of the shoes I tried. I'm really happy with my purchases. Great experience.

We first tried mellow mushroom on a Groupon, and now we're regulars. The red skin potato pie is AMAZING (but make sure to ask for spicy ranch on the side if you're wimpy like me).   We normally get take out, and they aren't always super speedy to get to the side door (might need a bell) but food is very GOOD!  We also liked their BBQ Chicken pizza and Spinach Dip.   Today, a slow Sunday, we had a problem with our pizza being too spicy (forgot to ask for no spicy ranch). Hubby called the store after we realized our mistake, and they made it right. Customer service - heck yes! The team took care of us and were friendly and professional from start to finish.  Oh, and did you know they have gluten free crust and vegan cheese?!

I've attended Lacey's restorative class and Chris's power yoga class so far. I liked them both a lot, so now I'm a regular at Chris's evening classes (but I normally work during Lacey's restorative). Chris does hands on assists during her classes to help you get deeper in the pose or improve your alignment, which I really appreciate! The studio has free filtered water and tea and some Spiritual Gangster clothing, among other items, in the little shop in front. People are friendly and nice, not intimidating or elitist. I got a Groupon package for 10 classes, and it was definitely a great purchase.

My husband and I had breakfast here on a Saturday morning. It was predictably busy, but since we were ok with sitting at the counter, we didn't have to wait long at all. A few highlights:  - the cinnamon roll. warm, gooey, and crazy delicious. helps that I was hungry - a free refill on the fresh squeezed oj?! yes, please!! I got the refill to go (and pro tip - she gave me a little more to fill the cup all the way)  So the neighborhood perhaps isn't the greatest and the views aren't anything special, but there's plenty of convenient parking and I appreciate being able to get an awesome breakfast without having to drive all the way to Scottsdale. So why only 4 stars? Hubby wasn't wowed. Maybe he didn't love the banana pancakes as much as he should have. I thought my popeye omlet was very tasty! Fast, friendly service and a decent sized menu that has all the things you'd want and more.

Pro tip: If you sign up on their website for their newsletter, they'll send you a coupon for a free dessert.   I've ordered pizza from here once (giant size, of course). Obviously for take out since there's barely any seating. I got half and half of two of the specialty kinds and thought the price was very reasonable. Love having pizza leftovers!! I got a salad once there for lunch, too, and it was really good. One of my friends raves about their sandwiches, but I haven't tried that yet (why haven't I???).   Interesting little story: I wasn't sure which free dessert I should try, so I asked the two guys working there. They both told me they hadn't tried any of them which seems a little weird and definitely not very helpful. I ended up picking a s'mores cupcake that they only had one of since they said somebody who works there is somehow related to the bakery and their cookies are really good. The cupcake did end up being delicious, but mostly chocolate without too much marshmallow or graham cracker.

I tried to return a shirt I received as a gift. I had the original receipt and tags were still attached. They refused to accept the return. Told me to try another store. I thought whole foods was supposed to have a good return policy, so how is it possible to refuse something with both tags and receipt?? The purchase was less than a month ago.

As a wanna-be vegan, I feel guilty for loving this Chick-Fil-A, but they definitely earned it. I stopped by last week around 1 or 1:30pm to pick up a sandwich and milkshake (umm peppermint chocolate chip? HECK YES!).   From placing my order to receiving the items, every single employee was cheerful, friendly, exceedingly polite, and just generally awesome. I didn't realize how good service could be. These are the nicest people. I left in such a good mood.   And the food! Maybe it's just cuz I rarely eat fast food, but everything was frickin delicious.   Speedy, efficient, just overall fabulous. There's even a play area, so bring the kiddos!

Get the shrimp. Seriously.   Hubby says the chicken is ok, but I wasn't wowed by the steak. We both thought the shrimp was amazing.   Sauces are kind of overwhelming - lots of choices. My favorite was the peanut - it was slightly spicy but not bad (and I'm wimpy).   A very easy place to eat healthy. I absolutely LOVE that they recycle AND COMPOST!!! So very sad how rare this is in AZ.

Love the menu, love the service. I had lunch here on Friday for my first time here. There was a line of course when I walked in at 12:15 and the place is definitely a little noisy. Right away someone greeted me and asked if I'd be eating here or taking it to go. She reserved a table for me and my friend so we didn't have to wander around trying to find a place to sit after ordering (always the worst part of restaurants like wildflower, paradise, etc). We ended up spending $35 for two people for lunch, but I'm ok with that since we got two salads (both with protein added), iced tea, and fresh juice. My husband even commented that the food was much better quality that what we'd get at another fast-casual type restaurant.   I ate here again a few weeks later - called my order in and it was ready to go when I arrived. They even have a separate door and counter for take out. Not cheap - $22 for lunch, but that's on me for getting salad with chicken, juice, and a brown rice krispy treat. I was still hungry later that afternoon - portions aren't huge, but quality is top notch.

What can I say - I love this place. I tried the sesame soba noodles with mint and sweet pea on Friday and I've been dreaming of it ever since. I am addicted, obsessed, and pleasantly reminding myself that it's at least somewhat healthy. I mean, the mac and cheese is gluten free so that counts for something, right? LOVE

We arrived at 7:45 on Friday evening for dinner for a party of 20. My husband and I were the first to arrive. We were sitting at the bar for a least a few minutes, completely ignored by a "team lead" before someone finally took our order. The bar area is really small with seating for only five, so they were in a hurry to cash us out from the bar before we even received the appetizer we ordered. Hubby ordered a peach ale which still hadn't arrived 10 mins after ordering since they needed to change out the tap - I appreciate they told us at least, but it would have been nice for them to get a move on! We received it after asking again. Cheese sticks were average. I asked for more sauce and received it quickly. This place obviously hasn't been open long - they're still figuring things out, working out the kinks. Another woman at the bar said the place should be twice the size - like they underestimated demand. Of course that's how it looks on a Friday night, but this is in July when everyone evacuates the valley so I can only imagine what this place will look like in November or (God help them) March.   All of the above would have been mostly excusable if the food were good... but it wasn't. Even mild was way too spicy for us to eat. And I'm not the only wimp - so are all my Asian and Hispanic friends. Time to eat some cereal at home... Also, plan to work really, really hard just to get a tiny bit of crawfish. Not nearly enough payoff for the effort. And they did NOT validate parking, so we had to spend an additional $12 on that. And then more for dry cleaning our clothes... Even if you aren't a messy eater, the person across from you will get you covered with sauce. I asked the waitress how to get it out of my clothes, and she said that's why she always just wears black... thanks (not).
