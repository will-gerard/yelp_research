At this moment, I am very frustrated with this business. I booked a gel manicure and a pedicure appointment for today at 4:30 PM. When I showed up on time for my appointment, the two girls at the front let me know that they were "just about to email me" because they were running behind. I get it. This is the nature Of the service industry. I completely understand if a business gets busy and begins to fall behind. However, I am sure that they realized at some point (at minimum half an hour or so) before my appointment, that they were running behind. To reach out to me at the exact time of my appointment is pretty rude, since by that time, customers (like me) are generally already at the business's location ready for their appointment. I was also frustrated, because the receptionist also said that she was just about to "email me." This made no sense to me, as they already had my cell phone number, which is a much more reliable way to contact someone (especially when you're calling them at the exact time of their appointment, when they are usually parking or walking in; not checking email). I was extra disappointed because I was doing my nails for my anniversary and had a hair appointment and spray tan scheduled right after (meaning no flexibility in the schedule). The girls were very sweet and apologetic, but the lack of professionalism around simply picking up the phone and calling me as soon as they realized that they were falling behind is pretty inexcusable.

I LOVE Lux. I know- parking can sometimes be a bear, it's usually pretty crowded, and the ordering line can be somewhat chaotic. But I just LOVE it! The coffee is the best in Phoenix, food is great, atmosphere is artsy and energizing, the new building has tons of room to do work or sit down with a friend... I bring all my out of towners here and they always love it. I brought my Italian cousin to Lux during his first trip to America (he was doing a cross-country road trip and Phoenix was the last stop). He said that it was the best cafe in America and wanted to replicate it in Italy. Lux, I love you. Don't ever leave. Ever.

I love Fair Trade for the studying space, the people and the sandwiches, unfortunately  not for the coffee. If you are looking for a place to get some work done and eat a snack with some iced tea - I highly recommend it.

When I lived downtown, Rum Bar was my weekly (sometimes bi- or tri-weekly) indulgence. Rum bar is the perfect date spot - cozy and romantic with a fantastic reggae soundtrack playing. Drinks are strong and oh so good! My favorite drinks are the pina colada (trust me on this one - no syrups involved) and mojito, but I've definitely sampled most the bar menu. If you are a rum connoisseur, which I'm not, the bar is lined with what could easily be 100+ bottles of rum.  This is by far my favorite bar in Phoenix. I love it so much, I came for New Years! :) Parting words -Go to Rum Bar, enjoy the patio, meditate to some music, order some appetizers from Breadfruit and kick back with your rum beverage of choice.

Joya spa is my happy place. It is located in the middle of the Omni Montelucia, at the base of Camelback Mountain. It has a Paradise Valley address- but really, it is in a location that is very central and close to everything. You can get complimentary valet parking with your spa appointment, so one less thing to worry about on your day of relaxation! The spa is a short walk from the entrance to the hotel- so no trekking, like you may need to at other resorts! The spa has a Moroccan theme, and the interior is decorated with beautiful lighting and intricate walkways. You walk up the stairs, past the gym and fitness area to enter the spa. After selecting a gemstone and setting an intention before you walk in, you can set your hand on a beautiful crystal to absorb positive energy and release the negative before walking in  On my most recent spa day, I started with a yoga class- $10 for spa guests but open to locals too. The class room overlooks the mountain and it is gorgeous! There are a wide selection of classes and I THINK some of the other classes may use the balcony too.  The spa is beautiful with all the amenities you would want on your spa day- large jacuzzi like tub, sauna, steam room, and a cold deluge. Lots of icy washcloths to keep you cool. The waiting room is nice and comfy, with plush couches, fresh fruit, water and tea. There are two relaxation rooms (coed and women only), where you can snuggle on a soft bed and close your eyes for a little bit... There is a small rooftop pool, with a mountain view which I lived. I have gone to the spa just to use the amenities and have had a great day. I had also had massages and facials- both were great and worth the money. The only reason I am giving this a four star instead of a five is for a couple nitpicky things. I didn't like that I had to go out to the pool and wait out there in order to get my lunch. I have been to other spas, were you can fill out a lunch order on a placard and they let you know when it's ready. It was a hot day and I had been relaxing and didn't really feel like sitting outside for 30 minutes waiting for my lunch to be ready.  I also wish that the pool had a cabana for guests to use, an amenity that I have enjoyed at other spas too. Overall, I love the spa and I will keep coming back.

I just had my haircut with Shawn, and I am never going to anyone else again! After my hair stylist moved away from Phoenix two years ago, I have gone to DOZENS of salons, searching for the perfect stylist to transform my fragile, thin, oily but sometimes dry, cowlicky hair! I have been to every top salon in the Phoenix area (laying down some big bucks in the meanwhile), only to be disappointed every time... NO more!  Today I found a Groupon Now deal for a haircut at R Salon. Desperate for a haircut (but prepared to be unimpressed), I called to schedule an appointment. The salon was able to squeeze me in 45 minutes later. My hair stylist was Shawn and it was his first night at the salon -He'd just moved from E's Urban Hair.   Right away, I could tell that Shawn knew what he was doing (he has, after all, been cutting hair for 20+ years). He examined my hair with a critical eye, asked me tons of questions and set to work. I appreciated how focus he was the entire time he cut my hair! We'd been chatting up until my haircut, but once the scissors came out - razor sharp focus! Thirty minutes later, I walked out with a fun, flirty, layered cut - and I could NOT be happier. I'm all ready to book my next appointment and am done my search for the right stylist.  *Note to those of you with delicate hair  and scalps- Shawn is to hair styling as Jillian Michaels is to exercise. He was a little bit tough as he washed, combed and cut my hair.... But in the end, it hurt so good and  was totally worth it!

I have generally had good experiences with clean air cab- on time, easy to book... I also like that the fleet is consistent (Prius, not random personal cars). But my cab this morning wreaked so badly of cigarettes, I could literally smell it as I was approaching the cab. Now I smell of cigarettes as I am about to get on my plane. Feels a bit ironic- "keeping the air clean while suffocating its passengers with the smell of cigarettes."

Honey Vanilla Latte. Three beautiful words. There is a lot to love about Giant Coffee. The Honey Vanilla Latte is one of them. Creamy, sweet goodness.  I've tried replicating it on several occasions, but Giant's HVL is some sort of magical elixir of the creamiest of dairy (which I'm pretty sure is purchased from a local farm) and Bob McClendon's honey. Coffee and chai are delicious and the pastries are tasty. The ambiance is awesome and the staff is super friendly. On to my not-so-much list. On the food front, I've ordered the breakfast burrito two or three times but have never quite fallen for it.  The prosciutto and eggs had the potential to be killer but didn't QUITE make it to that "I want to eat you for every meal" level. My other disappointment is that I don't find hanging out in Giant to be very comfortable. I know that it sounds kind of weird, but the bar stools are kind of awkward to sit on and the chairs just aren't... comfy. They are also kind of strange about charging for extra things like honey. This just seems weird considering the fact that they aren't all that cheap. At Lux, the coffee bar is full of free ad-ins (including McClendon's honey) and I love that. So, Giant Coffee, I love you for your delicious coffee and chai concoctions but will  probably continue to spend my hanging out time elsewhere.

I LOVE to read. My five star review for Half Price Books is primarily based on the clearance section. Several shelves of books are priced at $1 and $2. And the books are good! I'm not talking Nora Roberts trashy novel type books (although there are some of them) but Pulitzer prize winning, International bestsellers, make you think for a minute books! I have been known to buy around ten books at a time when I go. You will love Half Price Books if you love to read and want to build up your library.   I have also purchased a few books from the non-clearance aisle -  a Pablo Neruda poetry book, a couple Joan Didion titles, and some cookbooks. They were all reasonably priced (half price) and the selection was good.  There is also a small selection of CDs and DVDs, but I haven't spent much time exploring them.   Lastly, I love Half Price books because they give teacher discounts on your entire purchase (even when I admitted that the books were for me and not my kiddos).

I recently booked AZ Big Boy Movers through movinghelp.com. I was very excited to use the company, as they had excellent reviews online.  I booked through the Moving Help website on a Sunday night for a move the following Saturday. By Wednesday, I had not yet heard anything from the company to follow up and confirm the appointment. I called at around 9:30am that morning and spoke with Sam, who was in the middle of moving another customer. He asked if he could call me back that evening or earlier. I did not recieve a phone call on Wednesday night so called back Thursday morning at around 10am in order to ensure that everything would be good to go for Saturday. I reached Sam again and explained that I was the one who called the day before and was calling back to follow up since he had not called me the evening before. He replied, "Well I didn't think you'd want me calling at 9:30 at night." Fair, but when we'd spoken, we'd said early evening. Anyhow, we all know what it is like to be stuck working a late job and not have the opportunity to complete other tasks on our To Do list, so I was willing to let it slide. Then, Sam explained that he was doing another job and would have to call me back again. Since it was only 48 hours before move-in time, I explained to him that if he did not follow up with me, I would book another company.  After I said that, Sam had time to take down all of my information and confirm our appointment for Saturday. The movers were scheduled to come at 9:00am on Saturday, so my boyfriend and I asked a few friends to come in advance and help us get a head start on moving house hold items down to the U-Haul we'd rented.  We had a pretty strict time schedule and wanted to ensure that everything was done on time. In addition, we were moving out of an apartment and did not want to have the U-Haul blocking everyone into their spots for any longer than necessary! 9am came and went. At 9:20, I recieved a call from Sam who wanted to check how things were going. I explained that his movers had not shown up. He said that he would come move us himself if he had to and would follow up with the movers and call back.  In the meanwhile, our friends had already moved about half our apartment and were meandering around as they waited for the movers to show up (our friends were going to help us unload over at the new place, as well).  At 9:45, I still hadn't heard from Sam.  I called him to follow up. He told me that he was driving and was "an hour and a half away." At this point, with half of our apartment already unloaded in the U-Haul and my boyfriend and his two buddies waiting around, I told Sam that we may just be able to do the job ourselves but wanted to run it by them. I explained this to Sam and asked if I could call him back in five minutes. He immediately began to argue with me, stating that he 'was already driving at 90 mph and did not want a speeding ticket' and saying that he would 'turn around right then because he did not want to drive an hour and a half and be asked to leave.' I reiterated that our agreement had been for 9am, not 11:15 and that we had friends at the apartment who had already basically done the job we'd hired them do anyway. I again asked if he would give me five minutes to call him right back so that I could see if our friends were up for helping us move the rest of the furniture from our apartment. They were. I immediately called Sam back to explain that our friends would help us and that he would not have to drive the rest of the way to downtown Phoenix to assist with the move. At this point, I recieved my first apology. Sam asked if there was anything that he could do and offered to do the job for free. While it was very nice of him to offer, it was too little too late. I'm very glad to hear that so many people have had such a positive experience with this company. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me.

Overall, I had a very good experience. It was two days from my best friend's wedding, and I realized that I looked like a ghost in my bridesmaid's dress. I went online searching for a good spray tan salon (I did NOT want to take any chances with 48 hours until the wedding). After scouring Yelp and Google, I'd narrowed my search to three salons. Platinum was the third location that I called. The other two salons were unable to see me on such short notice.  MJ answered my phone call and told me that she would do her best to squeeze me in. Sure enough, she was able to get me an appointment set for 2 hours after my call. Awesome.  :) The salon is located on the second floor of a building of office suites off of Mill and Broadway in Tempe. I arrived 5 minutes before my appointment and found the suite very quickly, since MJ had texted me directions. I was a bit confused when the door was locked and there was no sign anywhere indicating that it was even a business (from the outside, it looked like it could have even been large storage room)!  I am assuming that because the tanning artists also do mobile tanning, there is not always someone in the building... as for not having a sign? I'm not too sure about that one...  My tanning artist arrived 5 minutes later.. Exactly on time for our appointment. She was extremely friendly and welcoming. I filled out paperwork while she set up the tanning area. I felt a little overwhelmed when she asked what color I wanted but did not have anything for me to reference... For example, I wish I could have seen a look-book or something in order to choose something that matched what I was looking for. I told her I wasn't quite sure but did not feel like I had to be too dark. It is November, after all :) She chose a color for me and it turned out to be perfect.  I felt very comfortable throughout the tanning process since my artist was so friendly. The spray was freezing, but a little discomfort isn't so bad for a nice looking tan. When we finished, my artist asked if I was happy with my results or if I wanted to go darker. I was happy.  I paid with a credit card- it was $35 (GREAT price) with a $3 fee that MJ had warned me about.  PROS:  Price Flexible scheduling Tan looks natural Quick (in and out in 20 minutes)  CONS:  Location weirded me out a little bit. I would have liked more guidance choosing a color. I'd had a spray tan in Boston once, where my artist used the tan to "sculpt" my body. She strategically put extra coats in areas that would typically get more sun and she sculpted my abs and arms really nicely! My tan at Platinum was more of a once over coat- without as much attention to these details.   Overall - very solid experience and I would definitely go again (and would recommend it to a friend). If I could rate this a 4.5, I would, as my "cons" are pretty nuanced.

To preface this comment - my house cleaning has not yet been completed. However, I am already so impressed with the company, I felt the need to post a review! I called Ecomaids to schedule a cleaning for my boyfriend's and my new house. I left my information with a woman who apologized that someone would have to call me back. I was promptly called back within an hour. The man I spoke with, Bashir, was so friendly and authentic on the phone. He was very specific about each service that I would like to have done and made sure to give me a great deal on the deep clean for our house. He gave me a great deal ($179) for a deep cleaning of our 2,400 sq ft four bedroom house- this includes cleaning all drawers and shelves, the oven, and even the fridge! When I explained to him that I needed the cleaning done relatively quickly (i.e. within the next 36 hours before our move in), he was extremely flexible and accommodating.We scheduled for Saturday morning, but Bashir promised to call if something opened up. Sure enough, he called me within one hour to say that he could send a crew over this afternoon. I can't wait to stop by the house this evening to see what they've done (I will update my post then), but so far I have had an awesome experience with this company.  FOLLOW UP TO MY REVIEW:  I came to the house a few hours after writing the initial review, super excited to see what had been done at the house. I walked in to the house and found a MESS! Papers and trash were all over the kitchen floor. I panicked and called Bashir to see if his crew had come. He wasn't exactly sure but assumed that, because the cleaning had not been initially scheduled, they may have had to drop what they were doing and go take care of another job. Good to know - but left me concerned for a few minutes! The cleaners came the next day for the deep cleaning. The job was good - not great. But solid. Surfaces were generally pretty clean, as were closets and shelves. I found some areas that had been missed, but there was nothing major. Overall, I give this experience a four and would use the company again. Excellent customer service, but the delivery wasn't quite 100%.

Really cute baby store with a lot of neat and unique items. Definitely a place to stop into if you are looking for a cute baby shower gift or birthday gift for a little one. They have tons of little knickknacks like lovies, teething toys, books, and mementos. As for larger items, there isn't a lot of variety, but the items they do carry are higher quality. For example, in terms of baby bouncers/swings, they carry the Nuna Leaf and for infant carriers, they carry the Lillebaby. They also have a variety of higher end crib bedding and furniture. I really liked the store because I'm a sucker for a cute boutiques. That being said, I give it a 4 star (3.5) for for a few reasons: I bought two teething items that I later found online for about two thirds the price. Customer service was severely lacking. I was the only customer there with four employees and other than being friendly, no one really engaged with me in anyway. Lastly, for being a baby store- it is really tough to navigate- 1. it's not super organized and 2. It is nearly impossible to get around with a stroller. An employee (manager?) saw me struggling and, rather than help me out by moving an ottoman out of my way, she said "we typically cater to pregnant women..." Kind of weird for a baby store to not consider that they might actually have customers with babies. Now that I'm writing this, I might lean a little closer to a three star, but again, sucker for baby boutiques... So I will leave the rating as is :)

This would not be my first choice for Vietnamese but I wanted to try it out. First time was mediocre and over priced but I liked the idea of lots of fresh spring roll options. Second and third time they were out of spring rolls, salads, and sandwiches. That's over half their menu. Definitely won't be a fourth time!

What an amazing experience! Jenny is an extremely talented seamstress with a ton of experience. She did, after all, work as a seamstress for Neiman Marcus for YEARS. Anyhow, I came to her with a bridesmaid dress emergency! A broken ankle led to a month of no exercise, which left me unable to fit into my dress. The dress, of course, had no additional fabric to "let it out." Jenny created new boning for my dress and added a beautiful corset backing, matching  the panel and ribbons to the exact color of my dress. In addition to this dress over haul, Jenny hemmed my dress and added a bustle. AND she did this all in one week.  In addition to her incredible talent, Jenny is  as friendly as can be. I will definitely come to her again. As a side note- Jenny runs her business out of the house and meets by appointment only, so make sure to call ahead!

I took my pets to Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital today. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming (from the front desk receptionist, to the vet tech, to the doctor). As soon as I completed our paperwork, a vet technician brought us into a room and began a routine check up with our dogs.  She asked lots of questions and was very thorough as she took notes about our concerns and questions. The doctor entered our room with in 5 minutes.  Dr. Kanarish spent a solid 20+ minutes with us as he conducted our dogs' check ups. He was very knowledgeable and incredibly informative (without being jargony or condescending). He was gentle and thorough while working with our dogs. The price for his work was also very reasonable and comparable to other offices. We left feeling grateful to have found such a wonderful vet and confident that our dogs are in good hands.

Vicky had changed my life. I was suffering from adult acne and scarring - between the peel deal and Vicky's facial deal - I'm so excited and proud of my new skin :) Vicky is wonderful and friendly. She truly LISTENS to your concerns and takes her time to really meet your needs. Love love love.

I feel the need to update since my last review. Two years ago, I was frequenting Vicky's tiny room in the back of Salon 3121. Now, she has developed her own small business, complete with massage, hair, and mani-pedi beauticians! The salon itself is not very large or luxurious. It is efficient, bright and spunky- just like its owner! Is it a five diamond resort? No. But the entire salon has been out together by the hard work and vision of one talented and hardworking woman- and I truly respect that. I love going to Vicky, because she works magic on my face with high quality products, offers great deals to keep her services affordable, and is friendly and funny.

I just love the Bronze Bar. they have great hours and it is so easy to schedule. Their prices are also incredibly competitive. I have tanned there at least four times, including for my wedding. The color always looks amazingly natural and I am always complimented after I go. I have also been tanned by three different women and they were all equally great.

I love this place- clean, great staff, lots of colors that are often brand new each season, reasonable prices.   However, there is one young girl who works here who unapologetically rushes straight through her work and often does a sloppy job. It is terrible! One time I came with friends for pedicures. I was seen fifteen minutes after them and yet she finished my pedicure fifteen minutes earlier than them. I got a pedicure today and watched her do the same thing to another customer.   Five stars without this girl.. Three stars with.. Evens out to a 4. It's a shame because the rest of the staff is great but she definitely taints my experience...

This restaurant has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The person serving me rolled her eyes when I asked to not have cheese on a tortilla (I had never been given a choice). The other person literally did not guide me through any choices (he said "what do you want?"). Then he walked away in the middle of serving my sister. Awful awful. I asked for a manager and the person at the cash register looked at me like I was crazy. I will never go back. This place needs a manager and a major customer service overhaul.

I am editing this review. I did not have a good experience at French grocery the two times that I went. I know plenty of people who have enjoyed their experiences there, but for me, the service was lacking and the food was not good. Yesterday I posted a pretty angry review about my experience there in the morning. Since then, the owner of the store, Erin, called me to learn more about the situation and to apologize for something that happened yesterday. On the phone, she was genuinely kind and caring and I am glad that she reached out. This still would not be my ideal go to for coffee and a croissant. I have not been for dinner, and so maybe it is a different experience in the evening- as several of the reviews below reference dinner and wine.

The guys from Nusense came to my house a few months ago right after I had a scary interaction with a scorpion. They were easy to get a hold of, had prompt scheduling, and got to my house exactly when they said they would. They were incredibly thorough and explained their process as they went through the house. They were meticulously detailed outside, even spraying underneath all of my patio seat cushions. They were very informative but never tried to upsell me on anything. Afterwards, they walked me through their different deals for repeated services (super affordable). Deals include: Monthly service: $40, Bi-monthly: $70, Quarterly: $100.  They also have a refer a friend, get 1 service free special. Then your friend gets his/her third service free!  All in all, I was very happy with my experience. We were critter free for the past two months. I just saw a scorpion today so will be calling them back out for another spraying (fact of life here in AZ). I'm glad I have guys like Nusense who I can call in moments like this!

So far we are really happy with our entire experience. We bought a groupon- which I'm always hesitant to do because I've never had a good experience with services booked through groupon. However, I took a chance because of the good reviews. Michel was super easy to reach and it was easy to find a time that fit my schedule. They arrived right on time and walked us through each space with a black light to identify problem areas from our pets. We knew we would be paying extra beyond the groupon for additional rooms and pet stains. The price quoted up front was very reasonable. They were informative about our options yet there was no up selling at all. After completing each room, Michel asked us to walk through and verify that we were happy with the service provided. All in all- super happy. I will certainly update if anything changes but I don't anticipate that happening....

I love everything about this place. The management is wonderful, and everyone who works there is so helpful. Modern Milk is tiny, but it packs a punch. In one trip, I rented a hospital breast pump, bought my son an amazing Ollie Swaddle (hard to find in stores), and took a class with Cara from Taking Cara Babies. The manager is so friendly and everyone there is incredibly helpful. As a new mother, I felt a little bit lost and vulnerable in my first months of maternity leave. The women at MM are just so kind and there were so many fun things to look at for myself and for my son. I wish I could have taken a yoga class, but I couldn't get my act together to do it. Hopefully I will take advantage sometime in the near future.

Uch, I cannot get over how mediocre/borderline bad this place is. This had nothing to do with Gallo Blanco goggles either. The tacos are just ok- chewy bland meat, dry chicken, overly salted everything. I decided to give it another try today despite our bla first visit, because I REALLY wanted to like it. My husband ordered the Pollo Asado platter and the chicken breasts, pounded super flat, were dry as a bone! He ate about three bites and was done. I had a salad, which was fine- but it's a salad- you don't have to cook salad. We ordered two desserts which came with ice cream. When they brought out the dessert, we asked about the ice cream and the server went to check - coming back to say they "don't even sell ice cream." I pointed to the specials board in the back of the restaurant and it clearly said "with ice cream." To this she replied, "oh yeah we have to erase that." The brownie dessert was so bad- I mean dry as a bone crumbly terrible bad. I'm pregnant and eat almost anything- especially chocolate brownie- and I wanted nothing to do with this thing. Maybe the ice cream could have hidden it. On top of everything, the service was SO painfully slow for the restaurant being near early. After we ordered, it took almost thirty minutes to get our food and another thirty after that between waiting for dessert, check, etc. The first thing I did after my meal was text another foodie friend to tell her to stay away! So so so sad :(

Really good experience on Friday night of a holiday weekend. We decided to stop by for some appetizers and a drink before heading out to dinner. I love the setting within Desoto market place. They have a small menu - oysters, oyster shooters, lobster roll, chowder, and tuna tartare (maybe one or two other items I can't think of). They also have a small selection of wine and craft beers. My husband and I sat at the bar and made conversation with the bartender/oyster shucker, who was super friendly despite being very busy. Oysters were good. Beer was cold. Lobster roll had a good amount of meat (although the meat to mayo ratio was a little off). I would love to come by for happy hour (looks like select oysters are on hh specials) and/or at a time when I can be a little more relaxed and just chill. It's not the best setting for a group since the bar has pretty limited seating. The seats are also backless stools, which aren't the most comfy - and there is no where to hang a purse or a coat. All in all- good place for a couple to stop for a drink or two and some oysters before ambling on for dinner...
