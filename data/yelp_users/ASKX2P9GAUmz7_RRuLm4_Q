I thought the food was pretty darn good, especially for the price.  I got 3 tacos (cabeza, al pastor y adobada) and a carne asada sope.  Wife got something very similar.  All that plus a beer for $16.    The waitress was really nice, I mean service wasn't 5 stars but didn't expect it to be when you pull up to this joint.  Nothing to complain about except the smelly rags they used to wipe the tables next to us.

The owner, Jeremy, is a real solid guy. Went out of his way to help me out in a situation where there was a 3rd party at fault and Jeremy had to play a sort of middle man.  This place was pretty far from where I live but it worked out well and would recommend to others.

My wife and I love going here.  We've probably been there a few times a year for the past 6 or 7 years.  We usually get the pesto salad, di notte pizza and a nougat crepe.  Have never had a bad experience, great place when the weather is really nice out as well.

The rudest staff you could ever imagine. Don't freaking stay open late if your staff is going to be rude to customers who want late night food and drinks.

I always have a great time when we come here. The staff is always friendly, the beer selection is outstanding, and the atmosphere is great.

I just went today for the first time.  Really cool concept and the options you can add to your enchilada and tacos are a bit more interesting than Chipotle (not knocking Chipotle).    I will say that as a first timer, it's quite a confusing way to order as the signage is directly above you so you have to step out of line near the tables to see the boards.  The decor is pretty hip.  Had to sit outside b/c  there really aren't too many tables inside, so that made the experience a bit sour b/c it's so dang humid and hot today.  Overall a cool spot and I hope to be back.

Honestly, the food is probably a solid 4 stars but the service was probably the best I've ever experienced at a breakfast place.  Everyone from the servers to the hostesses to the bus people were awesome and therefore the 5 star review.  I ate the big gooey mess dish and my wife got the French toast.    We will be back.

This is a new office located very close to my home and when I heard about it, I figured it was about time to get my eyes checked.   Dr. Lam was extremely thorough and answered each question I asked with great detail.  She also answered questions that I had in my head but hadn't actually asked yet.    The actual office/store is very inviting and has a great selection of modern and more traditional frames.

I thought the food was exactly what I needed that day.  Good comfort food and very filling.  They had a lot of menu options but I went with the Country Style Chicken Fried Chicken w/ mashed potatoes and macaroni & cheese.  It was really good and the portion was huge so I had lunch the next day.  The service was pretty good, waitress was very nice, attentive and didn't do anything wrong.  She did fail to remove dishes like appetizer plates and old glasses when she brought refills but that's being sort of picky.

Cool place.  The staff is really friendly from the valet attendants/bell hops to the front desk and pool staff.    We had an event there recently and had a great time.  The rooms, while hip, are a little bit lacking compared to other local hotels.  This is a 'boutique' hotel so you kinda have to take that into consideration when assessing your expectation levels.
