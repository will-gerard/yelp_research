This is very clean and friendly place to eat as a couple or your family on Saturdays they have DJ music with a variety of good music.  The food is always great and very affordable .

So far the girl that is taking the orders does not like job.  You have to get her to answer questions. We ask how many cannoli in order and she just looked at us and say I don't know and just stood there and looked at my wife. It wasn't until my wife said can you please ask.  She made a face like OMG.  I haven't even tried the food and I already have a bad taste of this place.
