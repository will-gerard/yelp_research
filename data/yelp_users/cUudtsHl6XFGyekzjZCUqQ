I love eating at los betos. My favorite is their chicken enchiladas which I get constantly. They fill my tummy up and taste delicious with their lettuce and chicken and red sauce.  When im not in the mood for enchiladas my second favorite item is the green chili burrito which has just enough kick before its overpowering. This place is definitely a hole in the wall but isn't that what makes a dingy little Mexican joint so awesome? The only reason im giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because their food isn't consistent some days their food is really good and other days its just alright.

Upon first hearing about this new mexican food place down the street from my apartment i was not expecting anything great whatsoever. boy was i surprised. This place is definately a keeper. Not only is the atmosphere amazing (fountains and candle light) but the blue corn enchiladas i had and continue to have are so delicious that i keeps me crawling back. I definately recommend anyone to try.

so i wake up from my power nap with a super craving for chicken enchiladas. after talking my boyfriend into going with me on the epic hunt for food we take a drive to super Burrito i have never had before). Upon arrival we ordered a carne asada burrito, an order of beef enchiladas (for him) , and an order of chicken enchiladas (for me) with a medium coke. Pulling up to the window we wait and then receive our food. We stopped a few more places after that at the request of the boy and by the time we arrived back i sweating and breathing heavier than a fat girl at a chili fest. I opened the first take out box to find.....beef enchiladas. I opened the second box and found......CHEESE!?!?!? I definitely did not order cheese, that's like going to a burger place and being handed a bun with a slice of cheese. Wheres my damn patty?!?! So here i sit still hungry and now super aggravated.

Buffalo exchange is interesting; it's a better quality thrift store. It's definitely not somewhere where you can do quick clothes shopping or even back to school shopping for your kids. But, if you like being a treasure hunter there are really good finds. There were a few things there that I wanted but they didn't fit which was unfortunate since there were only one. The staff was extremely friendly especially one girl who's name I forgot, she even asked my name which was a really nice personal touch. There was one point where i though i was going to have to fight with a girl over a half off necklace with cool little brass keys and polished coral....but my back the f***k off look worked just fine.

I first discovered Lush on the busy bustling streets of SOHO New York City. The Scottsdale Lush was an equally satisfying experience. Besides it being a little cramp with the amount of people inside and having to elbow my way through to the items I wanted to see, I was stoked to be there. LUSH uses all natural ingredients except for two types of preservatives they put in their products methylparaben and propylparaben which they claim are by all means safe. All of their products are handmade in Canada then shipped to our local store.  On my visit I bought * Happy hippie body wash * Rub rub rub body wash * Happy pill bath bomb (which I was told was being discontinued and whatever was left was all that was left) I also got a sample of grass body gel which made my skin feel pretty smooth and two sample cups full of a sea salt leave on scrub that I can't remember the name of.  I spent under thirty dollars and definitely made out pretty well. The staff was very helpful hence the samples I didn't even ask for.

The best word I can think of to describe this place is charming. My boyfriend introduced me to this place and at first I was thinking of a fancy hot pocket (not something im particularly a fan of). As I walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere from the dim lights to the dingy checkerboard floor tiles, it reminded me of one of those hidden treasures I used to find burrowed around NYC. I ordered a hibiscus tea which if you are like me and enjoy unsweetened tea you will absolutely adore it. I poked through the menu and nothing really caught my eye until I came across the lamb vindaloo and I had made my decision. The food took a while to get there but considering the very chill setting and laid back personality surrounding this place it shouldn't bother you at all. It tasted great the only improvement they could have made was maybe putting a little rice in the pasty as well but to each his own. What really made this pasty delish was the cream sauce that accompanied it. I brought the heat down while complimenting the flavor. When all was said and done I was stuffed and had leftovers. We also go the garlic mashed potatoes which are equally as amazing but I would advise against getting them for take-out because they only taste good fresh. Me and my boyfriend love this place so much that we started a project where we get Cornish pasty once a week. He is starting at the top of the menu and im starting at the bottom and working our way down and up and trying every single pasty on the menu. Oh yes....its happening.

So i went in Thursday to get an industrial piercing, and let me tell you that i was terrified but i had to follow through  since i have always wanted one. I went in and everything was nice and clean. It was a very inviting place to walk into; there was a couch to sit on while i waited to talk to the receptionist, not as intimidating as i expected. When it was finally my turn and all the paper work was done, jewelry was picked out i was off to get my piercing. My piercer was JD he was INCREDIBLY sweet, and even though i whined and was a super wimp throughout the painful part of the ordeal he never once got annoyed and was very patient and afterwards asked if i was ok. I never want to get a piercing from anyone else again. That was the best experience i have ever had at a piercing shop and it was even better than most of the tattoo shops Ive gotten work done at. They even have suckers in the reception area (reminded me of the doctors office). They are a little pricey because they don't use cheap jewelry its all surgical grade titanium with internal threading so it doesn't feel like someone is trying to jab a pine-cone through your new piercing (a little less pain is always nice), and for an experience like that its definitely true that you get what you pay for. I'm recommending all my friends at work go to HTC and when my little sister turns 18 i'm taking her in for their special.

My reason for going into sprinkles was to get an "I'm sorry"  gift for my hairstylist that the previous week, since being new to the AZ area, I got lost and was an hour late to my appointment thus missing it and wasting her time. The parking in the front is tricky to say the least. You'll be fine as long as you take the speed bump like thing in front of each parking spot slowly. It is also a tight squeeze between the sprinkles and yogurt land building but its not as atrocious as everyone else makes it out to be. The design is very esthetically pleasing everything is very geometric with circles and squares. The staff are fake nice, at least that's how they came off to me and were a little ditsy but they did their job fine. When you go in just realize you will have to stand in two lines, one to order your cupcakes then you have to stand in the line right next to it to receive them and pay for your order. Apparently this was too much for the couple behind me to comprehend since they blatantly cut in front of me and the lady ahead of me. That woman of the pair did not look like she needed those cupcakes anyway but who am I to judge. I was appreciative the girl at the counter told them they had step aside and wait since their order wasn't ready. The presentation is very nice, the box fits the cupcakes in nicely without them getting maimed in any way and the cupcakes themselves are artsy all by themselves. The types of cupcakes I bought were the chai latte, black and white, coconut lemon and red velvet. The red velvet was the most pleasing to the group it was presented to.  They were stoked to get sprinkles and it made everyone's day. I didn't actually taste the cupcakes since I don't eat a lot of sweets but I'll give them 4 stars for creativity.

My hair was in serious need for a fixin'! The blonde layer on the bottom was fried and frazzled and I have a lot of hair so it was so heavy. I made an appointment with Samantha unfortunately I got lost on the way there and she waited as long as she could and had to leave. To redeem myself for my rescheduled appoint I came bearing cupcakes. Sprinkles cupcakes nonetheless.   It's a really relaxing warm environment. Very low stress. The staff wears their heart on their sleeve and they offer you soda and water as they do your hair. Everything around you looks like it came out of an adventurous dream. There is an artsy tree like structure with magazines hanging from it you can draw on the walls in the bathroom. This place is an expression in itself. Samantha was awesome she dyed my hair very well and the cut works really well with my face shape.  I almost didn't want to leave, and Samantha is amazing at her craft.

This place is fun and has and interesting atmosphere. I dig the conveyor belt and the minimal interaction from employees kind of like the automat that used to be in NYC on St.Marks before they turned it into a pinkberry or something. What is wrong with it is the sushi sucked in my opinion. Their tuna sushi which went around the belt several times was grey. That is not appealing to me at all. And I thought their pitchers that they served your drink in looked like someone's water bottle they pulled out of their lunchbox. Did not dig that. Also the staff don't help you so you're left kinda lost to figure stuff out on your own. Teharu you get 2 stars. Fun atmosphere though.Best thing there was the baked clams.

Silver mine is reliable which gives it extra brownie points. They deliver until 3am! Especially for those of us who work late, get home late, don't want to cook so we get delivery.  My two favorite subs are the Frontier and the Silver Plume. I think it's a unique idea to theme a sandwich place after a "silver mine". The guys that work there are really laid back and try to be as helpful and accommodating as possible but they are getting 4 out of 5 stars because their menu is literally just sandwiches and drinks.

Nice bunch of ladies. The girl that cleans my teeth is the best. She is always super sensitive to my fear of dental work. :)

Went in on a Sunday night. They didn't look too busy but the staff looked busy sweeping and cleaning. I had the Pera (pear and cranberry) which was an excellent combo of sweet pear ice and yummy tart cranberry chunks. My fiancé had the Limon Amarillo which was lemon with a light coating of sugar on the outside. Also great. We also had an Agua Vita to share which was also really tasty. We got the hibiscus and lime one. It tasted like hibiscus and honey. The lime was kind of lost but still very delicious. I would definitely go back again.

We had ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and the Goat Karahi. The sauces and seasoning was amazing. It was also nice to be able to have unsweetened raspberry iced tea as opposed to its sweetened counterpart. My only issue which is minimal at best was it was difficult to eat some of the goat chops because there were a lot of small pieces of bone stuck to the meat I was trying to consume. Other than that, pretty delicious.

I'm totally blown away. My first time into their salon I had an appointment scheduled with Lacey and she is WONDERFUL!!! I'm not going to lie I was a challenging client do to the fact I'm in the process of growing out my side shave but not wanting to lose much of the length of the rest of my hair and between Lacey and the owner ( who was very nice too!) they hooked me up with a lovely cut that I am more than happy with. I'm actually really curious to try their other services ie waxing and nail services.

I was really disappointed to say the least. I dragged my boyfriend out for date night and I wanted to try something new from our regular spots so I came across Nosh online and was intrigued with everything I read about it. I was waiting all week and was really excited. Upon arriving we went in and had a mildly awkward encounter with the girl who greeted us over whether we should seat ourselves or if someone was going to seat us. After we sat down we ordered some food and drinks and waited. Our food came out in a timely manner and mine was excellent though I wished there was a little more. My boyfriend on the other hand ordered the rabbit ravioli. There were only 4 raviolis on the plate and he pulled bones out of three out of four raviolis. While I can understand an accidental bone here and there that much was a little concerning especially for our first time being there. I also felt that it being so highly recommended for a date night spot it would have had better mood lighting. It was kind of lit really bright like a Denny's. Maybe I was expecting too much. But seriously Nosh, fix the bone issue in your rabbit ravioli because that is not cool.

Donuts are amazing. They are made fresh and you can taste the difference. The donuts have a slightly crisp texture from being fried and the topping selection is phenomenal. I  the Black Forest donut.

Delicious!!!!! The soy milk ramen is incredible you have to get the $2 addition of the hard boiled eggs. I don't know what kind of magic they use to hard boil them but they are damn tasty.
