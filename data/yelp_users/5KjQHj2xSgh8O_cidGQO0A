I literally had the WORST restaurant experience in the past 10 years last night. If you like being called rude by the manager, having your appetizers show up 30 mins after you order them and your beer forgotten... you should go here. If you don't like that sort of thing, you should go somewhere else.   I also found it interesting that our first waitress' attitude changed as soon as she figured out we were a table of gays. Can't help but feel as though that had something to do with the crappy service we received from her.  Here are more details. Even after out waitress left our table mid drink order to get another table's drink when he asked her for it, we were never rude to her once nor called her out for that action. However, when I asked where my beer was 15 mins after ordering it (all others had been delivered) and when we told her we wanted to wait to order dinner until our last party member showed up, apparently that was rude. A new waitress showed up and said she didn't know why she was assigned to us. Right after her one of the managers showed up and asked if everything was okay and we told her that we were waiting for our appetizer and my beer. We asked where our other waitress went and the manager told us that she was taken off the table because she said we were being rude to her! What? Why would a manager tell you this even if it was true? Needless to say, we drank our beers, ate the appetizer and left. The experience as we were leaving with manager #2 is even more shocking but, since I didn't experience it first hand, I'll leave it to other members of our party to explain in a post of their own.  DO NOT GO HERE.  There are better quality establishments in the same area with better food and better service.
