I loved this place, it's very cozy, romantic, you can sit in the patio or inside, very nice for couples, you can go there early and just have apps and drinks with friends or just have a nice meal. The service and food are really great.

just check your order before you leave.... hard thing when you go with 4 other people in the drive-thru.... wouldn't want to find out things missing after you left.

Oh my god.. The garlic knots!!! These things just melt in your mouth, fresh garlic, just delicious. Their pizza is just perfect ny style, thin and extra tasty. This place gets very busy but the waiters just manage, is just amazing. Carbs and more carbs, live it up!!

Superb food, so original, even the drinks are so different( in a good way). The hamachi/grapefruit dish was just to die for, it just melted in my mouth. Oh the pork buns!! Cant wait to come back.

What a bargain this place is, veryyy inexpensive and real indian food. The buffet is really good and the service was very personal, the owner of the restaurant came over several times to our table and gave very good advice on what to get. Everything was fantastic.
