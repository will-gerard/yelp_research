Amazing bagels, especially the Asiago and Egg bagel! You have to get there early or they will be out! Love their bagel sandwiches too! Btw people, if you think they are being rude please don't ever go to Philly or New York. You will never survive. Its a different culture over there and that's why the people at Hot Bagels come across as rude when they really aren't. Not much else to say but go in and try a bagel!

I mostly just go here when I want a good beer and don't want to pay $22 for a 6-pack of hand selected beers at Total Wine. Love the beer selection since I am a big time beer fan. Love the Rogue Hazelnut Brown, Sunshine Wheat and Murphy's.   Food is pretty good too, I love shoestring fries so when I want to splurge i'll order something with the fries or steal some from whoever is with me. I ordered the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger last time (medium rare). The meat wasn't cooked medium rare and it kept falling apart while holding it. I don't know if they just forgot to put something in the meat to keep it together but it was annoying trying to eat a burger with meat falling onto the place while you eat it. The BBQ sauce is pretty tasty but it comes on the side and is very runny so you need to pour the sauce onto each bite of the burger unless you're fine with BBQ sauce running out onto your hands and plate.   I've had other dishes here which have been pretty good but the prices keep me from coming back to eat unless I get a gift card for this place. I just will stick with beer

Glad to see them on the map after winning Cupcake Wars!!! Their cupcakes rival if not beat Sprinkles. Brown Velvet, Peach-Berry Shortcake, and Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese (sounded weird) but that last one was on Cupcake Wars and it was surprisingly really good as well!!!!  Not to mention their stuff is all organic (hence the brown velvet instead of red) Definitely get their cupcakes and you won't be disappointed. Just try and keep yourself from going too many times.... Hasn't worked well for our family yet. lol.

Went here with my father and brother while running errands in the area. We hadn't been to Line Thai in a long long time. After our meal, we questioned why we hadn't come back sooner!!! Busy I guess... We all ordered curry dishes, and thai hot. Lets just say all 3 of us who are big spicy food guys all had to get extra napkins to wipe away our tears and runny noses while chowing down on some delicious food. I couldn't eat the complimentary soup since I am vegan but they do have vegan/vegetarian options which is nice. All of our meals were very tasty and very hot!!! I'll definitely come back again. The decor is slightly old and in an old shopping area near/in sun city but I don't go to a restaurant because the decor is "cute" or "hip," I go for the food!!!!!

I would never be a regular grocery shopper here since I'd be broke as a joke after 1 trip here. That being said, they have a lot of options for vegans, health nuts, etc and they have a lot of items a lot of other stores don't carry.  I did recently buy vegan lasagna from the cold food area to take home and a vegan cookie from the bakery.... HOLY CRAP!!! I had to keep checking the label of the cookie and the lasagna to make sure it wasn't switched with non vegan foods. Best lasagna i've ever had and i'd put $ on that no one could tell that the lasagna was vegan.... Props to your lasagna WF... I like to stop by here when in the area for a quick bite to eat or if I need something vegan that another store won't have. Otherwise, still not an every week grocery store for me. Too expensive.

I ordered the pad thai. it was pretty tasty. Seems to be a family run restaurant. Very nice staff, but they all looked overly stressed and hectic which I understand running a small business. If i'm ever in the area i'll check them out again but its just too far of a drive for me to stop by all the time.

Recently went vegan and I was dog sitting for someone nearby. I stopped by here since it was close and they offered vegan options. I was craving anything curry and spicy for weeks after I went here! I ordered the brown curry with tofu. It had huge flavor, very spicy and just a well rounded fresh meal. I am dog sitting for the same people very soon and i'll definitely have to stop by and get lunch again since it was so delicious last time. I also checked in on yelp and didn't even realize I got an offer for free dessert for checking in. That was definitely a plus! :-) Server/Manager was very nice and talkative. I will say though, no one noticed me standing in the doorway when I walked in for easily 3-4 minutes. All the other guests kept looking at me with these pity eyes while they scarfed down their food. lol

I really don't get how people love this place. My first time, I went with a group and we all ordered pizzas. Each person ordered a different pizza and I tried them all. Not sure what's going on with the oven but everyones crusts were soggy. I had the pizza with speck on it which was cool to have on a pizza but it was pretty pricey. Plus having to pay for valet meant more money to shell out!   I wanted to give this place another try so I went again with two friends who brought me the first time and needless to say, same old story.... I emailed The Parlor before to ask of they had any gluten free options and I received an email stating the servers were very well trained in guiding me through the gluten free options on their menu. Would've been nice to just be told what was available rather than making me drive there to ask. I joked around with my friends saying the waitress will just tell me they have salads (I'm not driving all the way there to order a basic salad) so I ordered a pizza again. This time I used the sheet to make my own creation which ended up costing me $25 for a 12 inch pizza and they were skimpy on the ingredients plus I didn't order anything fancy. My crust again was soggy like last time and so was my friends who just ordered cheese pizza. How can you screw up the crust of a cheese pizza?!? I asked the server after we got our pizza what their gluten free options were only to have her say, we have salads? Totally nailed it!   When I left the restaurant, I realized I forgot cash to tip the valet guy. When he dropped off my car, he put his hand out for a tip which completely appalled me. I grabbed my keys and left while he complained to his coworker about me where I could hear him. I still felt bad and ran to the gas station across the street and got cash back and brought a tip to the guy. Needless to say, I will never step foot in this place ever again. I can get a top notch pizza from La piazza locale or pizzeria Bianco for cheaper than the parlor, no valet needed and a real deal crust that isn't soggy.

Its just like a Federicos, Filibertos, etc but inside a gas station and the quality is for the most part the same except last time I went (today) my California burrito had a lot of fatty/non meat pieces in place of the carne asada which wasn't what I wanted. If you like Federicos, Filibertos then you will like this place because its almost the same thing and same menu. Like Young S said, it does take a while to get the food though. Not sure why.

I am updating this review... Since my original review, they have been awesome!!! I'm dealing with an illness of some sort and they've been on the ball about helping me and getting me into the office quickly and when I need to see someone for a test they called and got me in that same day even with no openings. I will keep them as my primary Dr. because of how much they've taken care of me. :-)

I've been to a decent amount of sushi bars around town and I wasn't very impressed by here. I've heard nothing but good things from friends about this place and finally went this weekend for a friend's birthday party.   The atmosphere is fine, loud music on a Saturday night wasn't a big deal and the crowd was good. They had a DJ and a little bit of dancing for some of the songs but nothing crazy or annoying. I really don't care about decor, I go to restaurants for the food.   I ordered the Vegas roll since someone wanted to split it and its normally a fairly tasty roll. It was such a small roll I ended up ordering appetizers since I split the roll. For $11 the Vegas roll was very small in diameter with small pieces of fish inside and only came with 5 pieces! I wasn't too thrilled about that considering I can get a lot bigger roll with bigger pieces of fish inside at Tokyo Lobby. The appetizers were fair... I ordered the Crab Rangoons and the Pork Gyoza. For Happy Hour the appetizers are a good deal because they each come with a decent amount on the plate. The Crab rangoons had pretty good sized pieces of crab inside which is a nice change but 2 of them had nothing in them, no crab or cream cheese. Overall i'd like to give this place another shot and i'll review again but the first experience as far as food was sub-par.

What a great idea! I love trying new things and having a Caribbean hot dog was something I haven't tried yet. Needless to say I was thoroughly pleased. I had the Italian sausage dog with traditional and super spicy! Next time I want to try one of the fruit relishes like mango or papaya with the hot dog. It wasn't overbearing hot but had a great kick and good flavor. Frenchy is such a great guy who is super friendly and really genuine. Met him at Grand Canyon University where he had his cart set up. I will definitely give him my business in the future when I see him around campus! Give it a try!

I love this trail!!! With the nearby trails of Thunderbird Park always busy when the weather is great, I bring myself to this trail.  The trails are more challenging than Thunderbird also and longer!  Its hidden because at first, you see a park where they have soccer/football games going on and don't realize the trails behind the park leading to the mountain.  The view from the top is so great, you get to see lots of desert and cacti.   If you haven't gone there yet, please do so because its such a hidden gem. I rarely see people on the trails there whenever I go.

Seriously, how can you give this less than 5 stars with the flavors of their food?  I had the gyro picado with the side salad. It rivals any place in town. Go check these guys out and enjoy some really delicious food!!!

If you like to bake, eat healthy, etc, their bulk area is amazing!!! I didn't really notice it when I went the first time after they opened. I stick to a few areas such as the veggies, fruits and bulk area like whole wheat bread flour, flax seeds, etc!!!

I just recently started working out here and I absolutely love it. This is not a, scream in your face, testosterone driven boxing club. Everyone is like family, the staff remembers everyones names and the workouts are intense! You get a good mixture of boxing technique and a hard workout! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone.

My wife and I recently purchased a home and needed to re-key the entire place. I called several places and they all were pretty expensive and didn't seem to really care about my business...   I received in the mail a flyer for Keys Please and thought I would call them up to see what they had to offer. Ernie (the owner) answered and scheduled me right away for the following day.   He showed up right on time and changed all my locks and gave us new keys too. Great price and great service. He assisted me over the phone with what locks to choose and also in person. Really nice guy and I appreciated his help. I'll definitely use him again in the future.

I was really hungry and really craving ribs after the gym. Came here with the family and loved it! My sister and I had the full rack of ribs and they had a nice spicy sauce and literally fell off the bone. The spicy Mac and cheese has a good kick and is really creamy. We ended it with peach cobbler and a brownie cooked in a skillet. They were amazing.

I really like the concept of a quick drive through place like the Dutch Bros next door.   I wasn't sure what to try when I pulled up to the window so this isn't going to be a full review on the whole menu. Only on what I had and my girlfriend had.   I ordered a chicken taco, pork taco, 2 shrimp tacos, and the croquetas.   The chicken taco was so-so... They forgot my salsa which would've helped but the taco itself didn't have much flavor and the chicken was slightly on the dry side. I was glad I ordered a pork taco because that one was more tasty. Im not a huge fan of pineapple but it definitely made the pork taco unique and pretty tasty. Didn't even need salsa. The croquetas were the best part!! they were nice and warm, very cheesy with a good tangy chipotle type sauce on top.   My girlfriend's two shrimp tacos were pretty tasty and had a yummy sauce on it. She ordered it without the slaw which I think would've made it better.   Portions were small but I wasn't too hungry so it wasn't going to kill me. I'll go again to try more things because I find myself at Dutch Bros a lot. I'll post an update on more menu items as i try them.

I was left speechless..... What more could you ask for in a  pizza that cooks in a minute AND is perfected in its taste and ingredients. We split two pizzas, the Italian Stallion and the Dolce Diavolo (which comes with Sopressata, Calabrian Chiles, Fresh Basil and Honey) crazy combo but totally works!  I equally loved both pizzas so much and killed almost two whole ones by myself (the other couple that came with us couldn't finish all their and I gladly helped.) Like other reviewers, the crust was perfectly charred and the only thing I could compare it to was a marshmallow. When you roast marshmallows and make that perfect one that has that golden brown char on the outside and it's cooked just enough on the inside to where it's creamy and tender... Thats what this crust is like! Best pizza I've ever had!
