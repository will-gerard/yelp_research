I always loving going to Postino's. Love the bruschetta. Use the valet parking or else you'll have a heck of a time finding a parking spot. I

Omg omg omg My first visit! Yellow curry. Died from ecstasy. Veggie rolls. Died again. The dipping sauce is addicting. White rice. amazingly perfect sticky rice. The place is tiny. Get there early for lunch. The service was out of this world. Very quick. This place is great for lunch because you'll be in and out in an hour or less. I can't wait for my next trip to try the Thai grilled chicken.

Ugh, this is in a crappy part of town, nobody even said hello. Just that it was going to be an hour wait and to sit down.  I didn't sit in the old icky chairs, I left. How this place got good reviews I'll never know.  I don't recommend this at all.

Not impressed at all.  The service was crappy and the food was medi-ocre. I got the carnita's omelet and The other famous breakfast place with the big black bear out front beat this one hands down. This was my first visit...and my last.

I really liked Jack. I called him to get my new condo re-keyed expecting to wait a few days but he said he'd be at my place in an hour! He was great, fast, super knowledgeable and a fair price.  He even made me 3 extra keys :-). I'm definitely saving his number!

Love the cheese grits!  OMG they're to die for. Of course the chicken n waffles are fabulous. My 24 year old daughter loved the Kool-Aid on tap. The service is ok, could be better. but the food is worth the trip.

I loved this place!  I got the Mediterranean salad with chicken, a pita bread . Tziziki sauce came with it.  It was wonderful.  The owner was so friendly, she knew it was my first visit and made sure I was happy with every thing.  The chicken was perfect, tender and juicy.  If i'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely stop by.

Yes, this is a car dealership, however, to make a long story short I needed a car. I've had a Volvo in the past and thoroughly loved it. I was totally freaked out about having to go car shopping for the first time without a guy there who knows more about this stuff.  Being a woman I figured they would totally take advantage of me. I knew what I wanted to put down and I knew what I wanted my payments to be.  I don't remember who the sales manager was (I'm sure it's on my paperwork).  Anyway, I fell in love with a gorgeous 2011 C70 which was in my price range. Volvo of Tempe made it work.  It was totally painless and I was on cloud 9 for weeks. I still love my car  and I still think of Volvo of Tempe often and how amazing they are. I'd recommend them to everyone.

Chino is great. My fave is the emerald chicken and egg foo yung. Listen people, it's all about the food! It's fresh, not frozen like one of the other reviewers insinuated. The Refried beans are BLACK Refried beans and they're freakin' addicting. Yes, it's a little messy at lunch time, but it's like a feeding frenzy at noon! They're getting the food out to hungry white collars, blue collars, golfers etc , they're not trying to white glove the place!  If you have a closed mind you'll be disappointed :-) And for the reviewer who compared it to Chipotle....you're high to even put them in the same review.   chipotle=chain Chino=It's yummy, trust me.

First visit, the carnitas torta is amazing! It was gigantic.  The other 2 guests I was with had the lingua tacos and they said it was awesome.  If you expect great food you won't be disappointed.  If you're expecting ambiance you'll be let down.  It's definitely a small joint. While we were there it became packed.  I'll definitely go back.

Love this place! Plain steamed rice with green coconut curry is to die for, be prepared for food coma! This isn't on the menu but just ask for it, each dish will come separate so you can add as much rice as you want. Or get the spicy noodles with chicken, I get them mild, then I add some, ok,  A LOT, of the red pepper vinegary  stuff (NOT the red powdery stuff, that'll light you on fire!) that's in one of the little jars that's on the table. Amazing. The red coconut curry and chicken lunch special is super yummy, too. I got mild and I thought it was perfect, just a little kick but not too hot to set your lips aflame. If you like it spicy, go for the medium or hot ;) There are plenty of non-meat items, hence the big Indian crowd at lunch time. The ambience isn't what it's about at Touch of Thai, it's the amazing food! Note: DO NOT sit towards the back or use the restrooms. Funky smells goin' on back there.

This is seriously my all time favoritest chain restaurant ;-) Let's start with the music.....out of this world! As in Moody Blues, Steely Dan, Jackson Brown etc etc.   The food is always spot on fresh, tasty and up -to-date with whatever the newest diet need may be ie. vegan or gluten-free. I've never had anything here that I didn't like. (Except several bad dates, the YH is my go-to for the usual meet and greet, so if the date is a dud I'll at least be getting fabby food and catch a game) Try the sweet potato fries app with the creamy maple bacon dipping sauce or the Cuban roast pork dip sandwich with pickles and a Dijon mustard spread and the side of au jus has a hint of BBQ. I don't care who you are, that's good shtufff. The staff is great, everything is always clean. Happy hour is fabby, plenty of tv's for sports fans, a patio if you're so inclined to watch the movie-goers walk by. Again, another place I have good luck with.....see my reviews for the Sand Bar or BJ's

I had just purchased a condo and the seller didn't leave it very clean.  She left food items in the fridge, she swept the floor and left a pile of cat/dog hair in the middle of the floor and then she left her long hair left draped on the shower walls.  It was disgusting.  Needless to say I want buying my own place to be a fun experience so I went to yelp for house cleaners.  The Perfectionist Cleaning Services had 5 stars so I called them right away.  They scheduled a cleaning the next day!  There were 4 girls and they did an AH-MAZING JOB!  Seriously, there was nothing left untouched.  They even swept my little balcony, the refrigerator looked brand new when they were finished.  Even the hard water stains on the water dispenser were gone.  Like the other review, I almost cried because I was so amazed at how clean and how fabulous of a job they did.  They even folded the toilet paper ends like it's done in hotels.  I will definitely be calling them again and recommending them to everyone!

Love the food, it's always consistently delicious. My usuals are toasted pastrami (yum!!!!), calamari Caesar salad or a slice of pizza and salad. It's on the regular rotation for lunch. Check it out!

Heaven on earth if you like Indian food. Been going here 5 years for lunch and dinner. Buffet is super, ask for garlic naan. Tandoori chicken is the best around.  They've been consistent in their food since I"ve been coming here.  Not worried if the buffet is going to be cold (other Indian buffets I've had have been cold or cool, the food hasn't been completely heated) INdia Palace is Amazing, fresh, yummy, a kaleidascope of flavors.   These guys get 6 STARS. The anise seeds at the bar/cash register is to aid in digestion and/or bad breath, and yes, it tastes like black licorice. It's very strong.

I've been here several times and the food is excellent.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because on my the last visit my date and I were bombarded by flies (we sat towards the street by a window) However the food is amazing!  Seriously, the only thing i've ever had bad here were all the dates I've been on. The mediterranean calamari is orgasmic, the lobster bisque is yummy.  The service is good.  Get there early or else you'll be waiting, either for a seat at the bar or in the dining area.

Have been coming here for years and it's in our regular lunch rotation. Everything is excellent and fresh.  Our taste buds are thankful! I love the chicken and hummus, steak and hummus, and mediteranean chicken salad.  The produce is absolutely crisp, fresh and amazingly delicious.  We've tried a couple other places but keep coming back to Chicago Gyro, it never disappoints.

The food is absolutely amazing. However, keep in mind it's SOUTH indian food, which means it's on the spicy side. I had the lemon rice and also the Dosa with spinach filling.  Of course I doused it with with tons of chutneys too. (Sorry Scott B, I plagerized from your review) I loved it.  Nice and spicy!  I also got the cauliflower with chili sauce.  YUM!!! Don't expect ambiance, it's all about the cooking. My Indian friend loves it, she raves about this and drives from N Phoenix to the Woodlands about once a week.   Definitely go and give it a try!

I love this place and for those wondering.....no, it's not only pita's :) My fave is the hummus with chicken and toasted pine nuts. Very very good. Can't go wrong at Pita Jungle.  It's good food, a lot of vegetarian dishes, however there are some very excellent meat plates as well.

Apache Wash in Sonoran Desert Preserve  I'm afraid to say how much I love it for fear of it getting found out.  For you Camelback Snobs, stay at Camelback.  I hike every day after work, so I thought I'd try a new trail, I was getting tired of N Mountain.  Sonoran Desert Preserve is my new hangout.  I'm lucky enough to live 15 min away, so hitting the trails after work is my mini-vacation for the day.  I love the desert, so Sonoran desert Preserve views still amaze me...from the JOshua trees, the plethera of saguaro, palo verde trees, the sage bushes, red dirt etc etc.  I do part of the Ridgeback up to the Ridgeback Overlook back down to the Apache Wash, Sidewinder Trail then up to Apache Vista then back down to the Ocotillo.  It's about a 5 mile hike and took me about 1 hr and 30 min, but I did stop to take a few pics and to catch my breath at the top of the Ridgeback Overlook.  The trails are narrow and there are mountainbikers, just keep an open ear, move over and let them pass. I wouldn't recommend Ridgeback trail for small children, the drop off is pretty steep. The city of Phoenix did a spectacular job.  Sonoran is heaven on earth!!

Great place, I've had the hot dogs and the polish sausage, they're both pretty good, but my fave is the polish sausage. I totally love the malt vinegar on my fries.   The food is always hot and fresh, the staff is friendly and the place is always clean. Yes, this is on our regular rotation for lunch. Love the music as well!

I've seen this place for 5 years. I went to UPS that's down the way from Viet Kitchen and it smelled wonderful and the UPS clerk said working there is torture because if all the wonderful smells from Viet Kitchen. So I talked my co-worker into going. The place is bigger than I thought, it was already hopping at 11:30 am. We were seated right away, didn't have to wait long for a server so we got our drinks pretty quick. I ordered the 7b and it was pretty freaking good. I'm pretty sure they don't use msg in this dish  because I had to add soy sauce. I also added chili pepper sauce and then gave it a squeeze of lime juice. Yummy! I absolutely loved this place and definitely will be going back. Go get your noodle fix on and get the 7b.

I'm going to have to brag and say I've been one of the lucky ones according to everything I've read. I've had Sparklett's for a year. My water is delivered timely and consistently with no issues of getting water I never ordered.  However, I must say I've been thru 2 coolers but they've replaced both coolers within a couple of days that I reported it.  My delivery driver is Travis, maybe that makes a huge difference.  This last cooler that went out, Travis told me, was one of the bad ones, so he gave me a very nice, modern looking cooler that's supposed to be a lot better than the previous ones.   When it's delivery day, All I do is leave my empties by the door and a sticky note with how many bottles I need.  That's it.  Thankfully Travis is good, Sparklett's needs to keep him, don't promote him, what if I get a krappy delivery driver???? :)

I don't know what planet the other reviewers are from, but I just got back from the Olive Tree Market and Grill and it was TERRIBLE. My lunch partner had the "classic" gyro combo and I had the chicken "schwarma" combo.  There isn't anything good to say about this place.  Neither of us finished our lunches.  The fries were oversalted, the cold chicken schwarma was pre-cooked, sliced chicken breast with the WORST tzatziki sauce. His gyro was not fresh, it was room temperature, the meat was below average and the produce wasn't fit for rodents, all of it very sub-par.  The place was dirty, grimy and just overall disgusting. That's what we get for trying a different Mediteranean place.

I decided to go try Sonoran Foothills Pet Clinic out because 1) they are literally seconds away from my place and 2) because of the great reviews on yelp. This was my first visit and I was pleased.  Everyone was cordial, Dr Grossman called me the following day to followup with blood results. There is a separate entrance for Cats and Dogs, the lobby was clean and I didn't have to wait (granted I was 10 minutes) Total cost for shots, a checkup, bloodwork lab work, was $189.  I haven't had a pet in years so I'm not sure if this is the average cost. I'll definitely go back.

Ok, I just moved up to this area so I'm scouting out new nail places. Saturday, noon-ish, and the place is empty.....that should have been my first clue. I'm there for a fill and a pedi.  They seat me for my pedi....the worst pedi I've ever gotten.  I paid $5 extra for the callous remover...the girl just didn't have the muscle or the fortitude to use that grater hard enough to do any good, all she did was roughen them up so that now my feet catch the carpet. Total pedi time was 30 min.  Then they take me over for my fill, but she had to move the mail and a half eaten banana from the station before she could start.  She tried to tell me my nails were old and needed to taken off and have a new set put on....i just had them put on 4 weeks ago so I told her so but she argued with me anyway. She didn't buff or use that dremel thing on my nails so there's acrylic built up around my cuticles.   The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because they had a fabulous assortment of colors, regular and gel.

I tried giving this place a 2nd chance but it failed me...again. I got a "carnitas" burrito.  I prefer my carnitas shredded. Period. This was plain diced pork with the unmentionable chewies. I don't even think there was salt or pepper. Don't know what kind of oil they use but it leaves an after taste. There's not much inside but pico and a little guac so the burrito was dry. Not impressed with the tortillas either, dry and flaky. Just a sub-par burrito, but anything is good when you're hungry, just not $7 good.

I've only been here for a few pedis and I've had great experiences as far as the typical run of the mill nail salons go. After reading the reviews about the acrylics and gel nails, I'll keep going to my other place.  I have to say, this place is clean, organized and well maintained. That's why I gave it 4 stars.  Another place I've been to looked like a mush mash of outdated salons. So over all my experience was fair and the price comparable, A pedi with callous remover and design (flower w/ bling) was $30, tip not included.

This place is mediocre, it's the typical salon that's found every half block. When they say the wait is 5 min, they mean at least 30. Most of the time I'm satisfied with the end result. One time I showed up a few minutes before they opened, as do some of the other customers, and when I asked for a fill,  they put my name on the list, told me that they had another person on the way in, and then a couple minutes later they told me that they weren't open yet however there were already people getting pedicures and manicures.  Cash is a little less expensive. I keep going here because I haven't found a better place.

Yep, it's pretty freakin good!  Love the pulled pork sandwich! The mac n cheese is awesome, ask them for some of the extra salt/spice they put on top, it's to die for! This is on our regular rotation where we go to lunch. I'm a Texas gal so I think I know a little about bbq...... Love POF

I absolutely hate this place.  Don't come here and plan to visit the guests you're with.  It's loud, the bar was sticky, the bartender wasn't friendly.  My $10 Patron marg, was terrible.  Every time someone wants to meet up there, I have to be the b*tch and recommend someplace else.  Like the other reviewer, Melanie, said , it was too disorganized, too loud, sloppy food etc.  It's a meat market no matter your age.

It was great.  I was thoroughly surprised and very pleased with the quality, flavor, price and portions.  If you get the plate portion, it's easily enough for 2 meals, at least for us girls.  My fave is the steamed cabbage underneath the meat.  What can I say?  :D  The mac salad is scrumptious and smooth.  The ribs were flavored really well, the katsu chicken is the best i've had in Phoenix and the BBQ chicken was amazing with the teriyaki sauce mixed with Sriacha.

I've been back several times since my first visit, and it's still AWESOME! It's clean, very super fresh food.  The staff are always friendly.  I've had a variety of things from the menu and it's all so freakin' good.  The chicken curry is yummy, however it's on the spicy side :) as in runny nose and sweaty forehead kind of spicy....and I eat Thai and indian food..just sayin'. LOVE LOVE LOVE Leo's !!!!

I've been back 3 times so now I think I should write my review of what used to be the best kept at work....we discovered this place a week ago, yes, I've been back 3 times.  Soooooo, I had a lunch date, I've totally dodged this guy for almost 2 weeks and I figured if the date is going to be krappy I'm not sacrificing good food..well no sooner did I sit down when a couple of my coworkers walk in, wtf?? I was trying to hide but I guess since we've bragged this place up they decided to try it out. The date was a dud, as in mr Rogers kind of way, but I still had an amazing lunch with ESPN...over my date's shoulder ;).  I had the hummus, and I added a skewer of chicken and got a side of the Greek garlic yogurt. I think for the money, the lunch special is the way to go, I love the hummus and I love the chicken, however, with a drink my lunch was steep at 14.50. They should make a lunch portion of the hummus with chicken because an order of hummus alone is still way too much for one person. That's the only reason I chose 4 stars, otherwise it gets 5 stars and fireworks!!!  Btw, on my way out the door with mr Rogers , my manager walked in with another co-worker.  Word of mouth isn't the best way to advertise, said no one ever!!

I don't think I iterated how wonderful the food is. The chicken is THE moistest chicken ever, i dunno what they do to their chicken but it can be cut with a fork and melts in your mouth. I don't eat rice but I will indulge in the most scrumptious rice around. This hidden gem is definitely the best Greek around. I've also had the lettuce wraps, 4 in an order, doesn't sound like enough, right? I only ate 2 and had to take the other 2 to go. They are freakin' awesome! Fresh tomatoes, chicken, and a couple of different sauces make these sooo wonderful! Did I say how yummy this place was!!? Go! now!

I was contacted by the NEW manager to give them another chance so I did. I was pleasantly surprised. Our server was attentive, answered our questions and definitely made our visit pleasant.  The concept of Genghis Grill is Mongolian. I think anyone's first visit will be daunting but the staff will walk you through it. I think the trick is to make your own bowl vs having them make it.  For dessert I got the brownies and oh em gee, they were wonderful! If you're not willing to get up and put a little effort into preparing your meal then this isn't for you but it's worth it to try all the different spices, sauces and salts.

Even though this was my first visit and I was in only for an oil change I was impressed by the customer service from Tyler.  The waiting area was very clean and modern. There was complimentary fresh coffee, donuts, water in the fridge and even a cappuccino machine. I made the appt with Tyler for 7, however, the service dept doesn't open til 7:30 in which I wasn't informed and I was a little peeved about that. Tyler told me my car would be ready by 8:30, at 8:10 he popped over and said my car was getting washed, at 8:30 my car was ready! It was clean and had new, fresh oil. I was so satisfied when I was driving away that I felt like a princess!

I had to go back a week later for another minor issue, and I was shocked that Tyler remembered me, let alone my name.  When I called, they told me I didn't need an appointment, so I stopped by.  Tyler fixed my windshield wiper fluid hose connector "thingy" and I was on my way. No charge.  Just extremely amazing customer service. Thank you Tyler and Mark!

I have had Dan on my list to call for 3 years and I finally made the call. Omg, I don't know why I waited so long. I got in within 3 days of making my appt. he's got a fabulous set-up, music on, a great waiting area so you can watch him do his magic and chit chat with him. He's a super nice guy, he's professional, very down to earth and a perfectionist. I absolutely love my new tinted windows and I could kick myself in the arse for not calling sooner. I'll definitely recommend him to all my friends or anyone who asks.

Ok, We had to come back a 2nd time since the first time was excellent. and the 2nd time was just as yummy! I got the Pad Thai, it comes with shrimp AND chicken!  I was surprised it came with both but that's a bonus right?  The shrimp was cooked perfectly as was the chicken.  The chicken however is thigh meat which I wasn't prepared for, but it's still amazing pad thai. I didn't finish it so I'm now eating it for lunch 24 hours later...at my desk...cold.  Eating it cold brings out so many more flavors that I didn't experience when it was hot and fresh like the Thai basil, lime juice and cilantro. I'm a fan of Angelina's for sure. The service was superb, I don't know who our server was, but he was cool and very attentive.   I have absolutely no complaints...except they need to fix the chairs so they slide on the carpet easier :)

Stopped in for a company department lunch, big mistake.  terrible food and terrible service. The bartender was our server, but bless his heart, he tried.  we waited close to 30 minutes for our food, which isn't ideal for when you're on company time. I ordered a lunch special, salad and with what ended up being breaded boneless deep fried chicken strips, however from the menu pic it looked like they were grilled chicken strips.  It wasn't, so I was very disappointed, but i tried to eat it and it was as bad as I knew it would be. Don't go to NNY, every experience i've had there has been terrible.

I had the Banderita  burrito and it was amazing, a party for my mouth. The best chile roja EVER! I've never been disappointed with Ricardo's. The carnitas torta is scrumptious, too. It gets crowded at lunch but you'll be able to find a seat. Try it! If you enjoy authentic Mexican food, you'll love this. The salsa bar has some fabby sides, my fave is the onions. They're brown, sautéed a little, very tasty. Remember: you're going for the food, not the ambiance. It's about the art of food cooked with passion!

Came here on a whim for lunch and didn't know what to get.  We've been back twice because it was so good. I ordered the  spicy Pork bulgogi bento.  Everything that came with it was wonderful, the salad has been super fresh and crispy, I love the dressing that comes with it, very light soy type of dressing.  The tempura veggies are super fresh and crispy.  I loved the spicy pork.  Not too spicy, just enough kick.  Like Taylor Momo's review, there were a few things unexpected that came with it, and everything tasted amazing.  I don't leave there over-stuffed and in a food coma which is detriment to sitting at a computer all day, but I left feeling full and satisfied. I'm happy to have a new fave place for lunch!

My first time here and I was very impressed. The nice gentleman at the front was very sweet and helpful.  He showed me where the polish colors are ( in the back on the left) they have a LOT of gel colors! My nails were a mess from a previous nail place, the color chipped after 3 days, I've needed a new set but he kept saying I didn't and I had 3 nails pop off in a week.  Sooooooo, I found 5 Star Nails and went in. I got Eric, and he's amazing. My nails haven't been done this well in years!!!! He's a perfectionist, so if you settle for mediocrity then Eric isn't your guy. I shouldn't really giving Eric kudos because I don't want my secret out but I was amazed that after he was all done, he took the Dremel thing and gently cleaned up the polish closest to the cuticles. He's simply the best.  I'm going back tomorrow for a pedicure.

Ok my 2nd time back and I was doubly impressed.  There isn't a sheet to write down your name, the gentleman up front asks what you need etc etc.  He actually remembered my name. I didn't even give it to him. 2 weeks later and he actually remembered who I was. I'm used to being a number at other places so I was genuinely impressed. 5 stars again.

It had a super buffet for a Saturday!  I loved every morsel of it. Keep in mind it's south Indian so it'll be on the spicy side,  But everything has amazingly bold flavors. The staff were so nice, they helped my grown daughter choose her food since she is new to Indian food and doesn't like spicy.  I'll definitely be back. Go try it!

Yummmmy! My first visit and I was totally impressed with the freshness and myriad of flavors. I ordered a burrito with roast pork, pinto beans, pico and the works. It was very fresh. I loved the tomatillo salsa, however, I do wish they had a salsa bar.  It gets crowded at noon so go early!

Ok, Dunkin Donuts are everywhere these days but I haven't had one since I was a kid living in Texas 47 years ago so I decided to try them out. The girl taking my order in the drive thru was impatient, I was probably interrupting her precious time from looking at her phone. Get to the window and she drops my change on the driveway and doesn't give 2 f*cks. I get home to dig into my donut and it's upside down and all the frosting came off. I don't know about you, but I'm a frosting whore so I was pretty ticked off. Nice first impression DD. I will support only local businesses from now on.
