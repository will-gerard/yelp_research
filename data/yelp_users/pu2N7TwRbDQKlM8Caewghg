It's was New Years Day so I wanted to try a new place and settled on The Good Egg. The place has a home like feel and reminded me of the Midwest. The menu was big and had a great variety. I had the egg-crepe things...basically an omelette wrapped in a crepe w a side of hollandaise sauce. Looked like a quesadilla and tasted great. Will be back for sure.

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The staff is rude and the doctors only care about getting you in the office do that they can charge your insurance. I recently needed som FMLA paperwork filled out for a few days off work (one of which was for an appointment at their office) and found out 2 weeks after the fact that they would not be able to fill out the paperwork without another appointment to do so. That leaves me with waiting another week to get the paperwork complete or take another day off work that I don't have to take off. When I use a colorful four letter word to show my frustration, I was hung up on by the receptionist. When I called right back she put me directly on hold and I waited got 20 minutes before giving up. After a few hours I called back and could not get an explanation besides that is the policy. I asked to have the PA call to discuss why I am frustrated. Only response was "you have to come in". So I had her make the appointment and as I was hanging up used that same four letter word to express my frustration. The PA called right back and canceled my appointment, stating that she will let me know if the dr will see me or refer me to a specialist. UNBELIEVABLE.

This place is around the corner from my apartment and right next to a Jimmy John's. I was on may way there when I decided,to give Gandolfo's a try. It took me 10 minutes to read and re-read the menu because everything sounded great. I finally decided on the Carnegie Hall with pastrami and both spicy mustard and Russian dressing. Only took a few minutes to prepare and I was back home enjoying it in a few minutes. I will defiantly be back to try more of these sandwiches.

I was out tonight taking some pictures, as it is a hobby of mine and was ran out of CityScape by one of their rent a cops. She told me that I could come back during business hours to fill out a form. I was just set up on the walkway over Central taking long exposure shots of the traffic. You know, really causing a ruckus. Doubt I'll be back for anything now.

This place was incredible. I drive by all the time to and from work and have read great reviews and finally made it this morning. It was great and is will be back. We waited a while to order at the bar and then found a place to sit. I suggest having an idea of what you want and have one person stand in line to order while the other grabs an open table. The cold brew coffee was good coming from a coffee novice, and my girlfriend was a fan of the regular coffee and she is an avid coffee drinker. When I tasted my crêpe, I was floored. I ordered the Crêpe Burro, chipotle crêpe wrapped around bacon, eggs, avocado, and pepper jack cheese. Not to mention the chipotle sea salt and sauce. My girlfriend got the vanilla bean custard with strawberries, and roasted walnuts. We each tried a little of each other's and agreed that we would be back to try the other options and have already found two favorites.

I usually feel like I'm getting taken advantage of. Tyler took the time to explain everything and why and also gave me some suggestions about other things that might be good for normal maintenance down the road. I will likely bring my car back for those, rather than roll the dice somewhere else.

One of my favorite places I have ever eaten at. My girlfriend and I ate at a location in Denver 2 years ago. At that time there was no AZ location...we checked. When we saw that there was one in Phoenix this morning the only question was how fast can we get there?  This location was just as good as the one in Denver. The staff was friendly and attentive. We were sat at the bar and then asked to move over 1 spot each so another couple could sit next to us. For our trouble (none) the waitress sent us a free pineapple upside down pancake. We ordered the Benny Goodman (eggs Benedict/lox creation) and the Pot Pie (spin on biscuits and gravy). Everything was great. Always busy so be prepared to wait. I would have no problem waiting for an hour, maybe more.

Simple process and didn't take much time at all. I suggest making an appointment, but they do take walk-ins. Dr Jordan was easy to talk to and after a quick exam he wrote up the paperwork and I was on my way with a few referrals to "caregivers" that I could go to before my actual card arrives. I can't wait to get the actual card, but it has only been 3 days now.
