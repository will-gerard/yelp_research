This was the spot that me and my Biochemistry buddies would go to for our monthly post-exam meal. We would come, sit down and devour all that is needed to drown the pain, the pain of Biochem.   Food = spectacular, everything is really good, from the pho to the orange chicken.

Like I always say, meat always taste better when you have a heaping amount of veggies. The burgers are great and the open salad bar makes this place all the more delicious.

The fish ball noodle soup and sour vege with beef is super tasty here. Definitely very traditional.

This is the best burger place I've ever been to. There is no competition. There is only Delux. Accept Delux. Delux will be thy savior.

Mother of All that is great and good, this is the best place for sandwiches, they can do one thing to enhance their product though, and that's to toast the sandwich.

Hole in the wall greatness. Sorta pricey though, but, if you're a potato fan this place will rule your soul -- and you will have no complaints.

If you want a thick greasy delicious burger that will clog your remaining arteries and wreck your gastrointestinal tract, come to smash burger ;).

Best fried rice I've tried. My girlfriend ordered the shrimp fried rice and added jalapenos and XO sauce and it was delicious! Its not on the menu but you can ask for it. The beef chow fun was good too but a little plain.

Add instant ramen, add a slice of beef, commercialize it as hip, sell for 8 dollars = Satanism. No Thank You Republic Ramen, No Thank You and Never Again.
