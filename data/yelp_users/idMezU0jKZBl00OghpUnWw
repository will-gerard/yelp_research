I always enjoy seeing a thriving family owned business. We ate the New Yorker with fries and it was delicious. I enjoyed the coleslaw on top of pastrami. The French fries were crispy and appropriately warm. The staff was also very friendly.

I stopped after work to place a to go order. I ordered fried rice, California rolls, and noodles that were recommended. I appreciated the plentiful serving sizes and friendly service as I waited. The food was okay. I hoped for more, but did not enjoy my meal. The California rolls were dry and lacked flavor. Maybe it was a bad day for them.

Last night my husband and I enjoyed a wonderful evening at the symphony in downtown Phoenix. We considered getting pizza from Pomo's or Cibo, but instead we decided to support a local restaurant near our home. Prior to leaving the downtown area we looked up the website, which indicated the restaurant closes at midnight. We arrived around 10:20 pm and the sign on the door also indicated that Ground Control was open to midnight. The open sign was also on.  I walked in and a server told me it was closed. I recommend they update their website and signs with the new closure times.   Fortunately, after checking on our doggies we found Mod's. It was 8 minutes before they closed when we arrived, but they happily welcomed us in. I enjoyed a glass of wine as we waited for our pizza to go.

We didn't try the food, but thoroughly enjoyed sitting at the bar. We stumbled upon this place as we strolled down Mill, and decided to drink some wine. Everyone is very friendly and makes the experience worth trying out. Thanks to Tony and others for making our experience and night out wonderful!

My husband and I wanted to watch the USC football game and enjoy yummy food. We stopped by other restaurants and the wait was 45 minutes. We noticed televisions from a distance as we passed Nakama, so we thought maybe they have the game on. We walked in and sat in the lounge area and one of the very friendly staff changed the channel. We shared the Nakama sampler and chicken fried rice. I enjoyed everything we tried, especially the monkey brains. We will be back to try an entree next time coupled with the monkey brains. The California rolls in the sampler were also very fresh. I definitely recommend this laid back restaurant.

I went to this restaurant once before and had an enjoyable experience. I realized that most of the experience consisted of alcoholic beverages, so this may have clouded my judgement. At the time, the restaurant also didn't have very many people. Tonight most restaurants were crowded, so we decided to come here. I ordered a grilled salmon plate, and it was okay. I love salmon, but left wishing for more flavor. Most of the vegetables were onions, which I thought was a bit odd. Even the fried rice was bland. This restaurant has a tepan section, so I was anticipating flavorful rice. I would give this restaurant a solid okay. On a positive note, the servers are very friendly.

My husband I frequent this very intimate restaurant. We enjoy sharing the se√±or taco, which always leaves us with delicious leftovers. We have not found another Mexican restaurant around here with quality food and GREAT prices!

I like Pei Wei as I always know what to expect. However, this is the second time that I have placed a to go order and waited double the time I was told over the phone. This time I was told the order would take 15 minutes over the phone and I waited over 30 minutes. I would have received the food faster had I dined in. I saw multiple people arrive after me after who dined in. They were eating or leaving as I was barely getting my to go order. I had a simple order of fried rice, chicken Pei Wei, and California rolls.  I'm appalled!!! I didn't even receive an apology. When I asked why I waited so long I was told a cook was missing. If that were the case then those who arrived after me that dined in should still be waiting and not leaving, as I barely received my food!!!!

I've never been to another Smashburger location. This one has exceptional service, and it helps the burgers are delicious. We frequent this location and have yet to incur a bad experience. If you get a burger be sure to try the Smash sauce.

I'm here with my hubby, enjoying a Primavera pizza. We both enjoyed the thin crust, and flavorful pesto pizza with several filling toppings.  We are always fans of all things pesto.  He really enjoyed the garlic bread with cheese and a side of marina. Next time we hope to try their regular tomato based sauce and possibly the crostini bread. The service was also good, which adds to the experience!

My husband and I came across this bakery unexpectedly. I tried the fruit cake and my husband had the mango cake. We really enjoyed our respective cakes. The fruit cake was moist, adequately sweetened, and included fruit as a filling with a strawberry on top. The bakery is a distance from home, but we will be back to try more delicious desserts.

It was okay. The food came late and the drinks were mixed up. It's okay if you want to spend $15 on a salad with mostly greens and not much else. Overly priced and the rib eye us full of fat!

This restaurant deserves 6 stars! The food is delicious. We had the BBQ platter, fried rice, and boba. We did wait a bit for our food, but it was well worth it. Everything was very flavorful, and full of spices that complimented every bite.

I'm typically not fund of Mexican food from restaurants, as my parents are AMAZING cooks at home. I came here with my husband and ordered a carne asada plate. He ordered a torts. We really enjoyed the food. The caramelized onions with the asada were delicious along with the corn tortillas. I also thought the chips sprinkled with cheese and beans that  they brought to us before our meals was flavorful and left me wanting more. I can't wait to different food on their menu.

My hubby and I just had dinner here. We both enjoyed our meals and egg roll appetizer. The coconut ice cream with sticky rice and sprinkled with nuts was the highlight of our meal, as it was our first time experiencing. Now it's a favorite and we look forward to another great meal!

My husband and I finally stopped after years of passing by. We got 12 donut holes for $1.29, croissant, and drinks. I wish I did not try the donut holes only because they are too good. I ate two and gave my husband the bag otherwise I would have easily consumed them all. The staff is also VERY nice and accommodating. We will make this place a regular stop.

Definitely a winner. We ordered a chicken schwarma and bruschetta because I was not too hungry and wanted to share. The food was more than enough and DELICIOUS! I'm not a fan of tomatoes but thoroughly enjoyed the tomatoes.   The service is also exceptional, and I could tell they are appreciative of the business. We were happy to see the small restaurant was packed the entire time we were eating. Can't wait to return!

Huge fan of DiCarlos Pizza. My husband and I enjoy the thin crust pizza. Unlike other pizza establishments they put the toppings on after the pizza comes out of the oven. At first I thought it was odd because I had never seen pizza cooked that way. All it took was trying the pizza once and we were hooked. The sauce and toppings are flavorful and plentiful. Not only is the pizza and cheese bread delicious, the owner is a very friendly person. We highly recommend this local pizza restaurant!

Thank you Dyson for your exceptional service! I can't wait to upgrade my Dyson vacuum. In the interim, I appreciate you fixing my current Dyson vacuum.  The issues incurred were likely attributed to user error. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes!

My husband and I are thoroughly enjoying the fish plate. The French fries have a perfect amount of seasoning. The fish is light and delicious dipped in both sauces that they provide. They have fish flown in twice a week from Boston. I definitely recommend this restaurant. The owners are also very friendly. We've enjoyed eating outside in their patio!
