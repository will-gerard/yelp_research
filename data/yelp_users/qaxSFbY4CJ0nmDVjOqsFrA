When it comes to great food the Texaz Grill is not bested by any place I've ever visited. I'm not sure if you're like me but I have certain dishes at different restaurants and that's what I get every time I go there. But for some reason I've had at least a dozen different meals at the Texaz Grill and each and everyone was great tasting.  Don't expect some stuffy, twitchy server at your table side but you will have what seems like a lifelong friend being attentive. Come casual, loosen your belt (did I mention that most meals portions are quite large) and enjoy your visit to your friend's because that's what it will feel like.

Ahh yes, The Farm Kitchen at The Farm At South Mountain. I had it bookmarked to try for over a year. Finally got around to doing just that on Sat, May 3rd, 2014. I guess it was a bad omen when the BBQ place I wanted to take friends was already sold out and had been before noon that day.  While they may serve good ingredients they sure do charge a premium for them. I spent just short of $22 (yep, half sandwich, cup of soup, drink and a small dessert, $22) for lunch and that was no tip included.  Why no tip you ask? Well other then having to make the sandwich I ordered and pour the soup into the cup you have to do everything yourself including clean up after yourself. TIPS really means: To Insure Prompt Service. There is no service here. Plus they gave me the wrong sandwich. So they got 50% of my order wrong.  $22 for a self service lunch with baskets and plasticware. The sandwich was good and the soup just ok. This should have been at the very most, $10 to $12. I guess you have to pay for the ambiance of dining outside. Hey, it didn't cost them a dime to erect a building, insure it, air condition it, etc. All of the other expenses which might drive the cost up to $22.  And honestly while it was nice to dine on a rickety old splinter infested wobbly picnic table under a tree, it wasn't like it was a nicely manicured golf course like lawn. I'm not sure why all you people are so WOW about this place. I'm never going back.

What can you say about any Waffle House. They do an excellent job at being what they are trying to be. I always enjoy the food and the service. If you're expecting it to be something it isn't then you'll likely be disappointed. I will go back to this one and enjoy every greasy morsel.

In-N-Out Burger never fails to get your quick fix for a great burger. Nothing like a 2x2 to make your day go better.

I've been there several times trying various menu items and all have been good. The Chicken Fried Rice (I always start with this on my 1st time in) was flavorful and had lots of chicken and vegetables. I have moved on to Pepper Steak and Mongolian Beef and a few others and they have all been quite tasty.

Great pizza with made in store dough. Only tried their standard crust but plan to try the thick crust and some wings soon.

I've been to The Farmhouse Restaurant many times but seems like it's always on Wednesday for lunch. Which fortunately for me the special is Skillet Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes, gravy, a in house made roll and their homemade cole slaw. This meal is as close to homemade as possible from a restaurant.  But no matter what meal time it is I'd feel confident to order anything on the menu. Someday I'm going to have to stop in for breakfast.

I see two other reviews and both very negative. I would like to invite both of those reviewers to run a small business of their own sometime. Do they charge more then Amazon or the Big Box stores? Yes. Do they make a profit on service and parts? Yes. The fact the items they work on tend to be low priced makes the economy of scale seem like you're getting a bad deal.   I say you are not. The fact they stock the parts, over the years have honed their abilities and can do a competent repair in a short amount of time is a good business model for them and a valuable service to the community. In this ever disposable society I for one will use a business such as Shav-Tronics whenever possible.  So bad reviewers, next time you take one of your vehicles in for a service make sure and bitch at them just as you have with this business owner.

The gang at Motortek has always taken good care of me. They are highly trained yet their pricing quite reasonable. I have referred many friends and they have all thanked me.  In this day of high priced rip offs, trust these guys, they will take care of you.

Our server did a fairly good job and was pleasant. The Caesar Salad was crisp, cold yet unexceptional. The Tomato Bisque soup came to the table at barely above room temperature. We informed our server who politely replaced it with another bowl which was slightly warmer then the first. Although it tasted just fine. The Chicken Marsala chicken was decent yet once again not too much above room temperature. The sauce was MEEH and the mushrooms chunky instead of sliced. Don't know, maybe they are going for a rustic presentation. The Mushroom Ravioli appeared as if it had been held on the plate for quite awhile then coated with a tasteless very white sauce which resembled whipping creme far more then an Alfredo Sauce. There was no flavor to the sauce. The ravioli had a chance had then been at least reheated in some hot water first then mixed with a nicely prepared sauce in the same pan. As opposed to just ladling a tasteless very white sauce over them and then trying to reheat in a salamander therefore drying out the exposed parts of the Raviolis and burning the horrible sauce. As I attempted to move them around on my plate they were stuck. That's how I know how they were prepared. Another franchise restaurant with poorly trained or inadequate kitchen staff putting out mediocre food to the masses. Never going back, never recommending.

What's not to like? Everything made fresh from scratch with many items grown on the property. Well thought out and well executed. I haven't found any item on the menu that I didn't enjoy.

They just celebrated their 1st year anniversary around July 4th. They have great food at an even better then average price. The staff has always been wonderful and the owners are there all the time making sure everything runs smoothly. Tuesday nights they have a special Taco & Tequila special for $20. The standard taco meal with 2 shots of tequila to sample or 4 half shots if you prefer. One of these Tuesday night I'm going to get there for that special!

Not a great food experience. These franchise food places should spend a little more on a well trained kitchen staff and let their food do the talking. I had a pre-formed, frozen burger with a breaded and deep fried cheap commercial cheese patty on top. Fries were average at best.  Won't be going back to any of their establishments.

Almost $100 worth of mostly MEEH.  First off our server was wonderful, but it went downhill fast as soon as the food started to arrive. The Italian Farm Salad arrived first and was the highlight of the evening. It was split for us ($2 charge) and was very fresh and flavorful. The Steamed PEI Mussels arrived before we even had a chance to take our first bite of Salad. As we were at a table for 2 there really wasn't much room for everything. Poor timing if any timing at all. Was almost like they were trying to give fast service to lunch patrons instead of people trying to enjoy dinner. Can you say "Hurry Up" and finish any clearer?  Then upon opening my first mussel at first I thought it had fallen out of the shell and into the broth. But no, it was there. It was about the size of a dime and shriveled up. Things didn't get any better for the mussels. The largest one was no larger then a nickel and the broth was very, VERY salty, Did I mention the broth was salty? When we noted the size of the mussels to our server she said they we just glad to have some as for quite awhile they were unavailable. Note to Fox Restaurant Concepts: Don't serve sub-standard food.  Then came the Main Entrees. Mine was the Spicy Shrimp. I believe it is paired poorly with the Malfaldine pasta. Not that the pasta was bad, it was actually quite good but it is a long length of shaped pasta which is not very easily twirled around one's fork. I couldn't decide whether to cut it (blasphemy in my world) or twirl it so I did a bit of both. It just didn't eat well and, I hate to say it, was also quite a bit salty. Now I am not shy of using and adding salt when needed. As a matter of fact I have over a dozen different salts at home and most nights dining out we bring my own small container. So for me to say something is salty, it's extremely so.  The next entree was the Seared Diver's Scallops with Celery Root Risotto. They were definitely seared but were ok. But the Risotto was dry, gummy and tasteless. Think of oatmeal that's been cooked and just sitting in the pan for ohh, say an hour or so and you'll get the consistency.  So let's add this up: 1 split salad 1 split appetizer 2 entrees 1 wine glass 1 beer  Just under $100 for a meal which was not enjoyed. I felt like I wasted my time and my money. I for one will not be going back to NoRTH Italia and question whether FRC will get any more of my time or money.

If you've read a few of my reviews you would know that I don't frequent or recommend many franchise restaurants. But Texas Roadhouse is one of the few. I've probably been to 8 different locations in 5 different states and the service has always been good, the steak cooked the way I ordered and the value excellent. And this location is no exception. Our server was great, food was tasty and well prepared and the call ahead seating made our wait, oh, about a minute!

Nothing like a well run, local, family owned and run restaurant. Best way to describe this place is Chipotle with Fry Bread. Not a cheap meal but worth the extra.

I've gotten chocolate dipped fruit on a couple of occasions and they always produce wonderful results. The sweetness of the strawberries seem to be hit or miss but my new favorite is the chocolate dipped pineapple.

Let me start by saying this is a review for me and for another guest whom I do not know.  First this was my first and will be my only order placed. At 11:45 AM I placed and order for Chicken Fried Rice. This is always my first order when going to a new place for lunch. I was told my order would take 30 minutes. Thirty minutes for a simple dish at lunchtime on a Monday? When I arrived 30 minutes later the girl out front asked who I was and went to the kitchen. When she came back she said he had just started preparing it for me.  Before arriving I was expecting a well oiled machine that could just not keep up with the volume because their food was just so good. But I was wrong, it's a very small place and seems quite dysfunctional. There were only two other to-go orders packed and ready and a total of ten people dining inside.  While I was waiting a previous lunchtime customer came back in and was obviously very disappointed. She had had to wait 20 minutes to come pick up her order and when she got home it was cold. Cold enough to bring back the meal and ask for a refund.  She had ordered the $6.95 lunch special but had told them she didn't want the drink which was included in the price. But the counter girl wanted to refund her $3.95 and not the $6.95 she had paid. This was a quite bizarre ordeal to witness. The girl behind the counter arguing with the customer and trying to short change her refund.  Needless to say I will not be going back. My meal was plentiful but not well prepared nor flavorful.

Had the special Sonoran Dog, fries and drink. The dog was great, the bun was great and fries some of the best I've had. And all at a very reasonable price. I will make the drive from Ahwatukee to eat here again.

I have eaten at a few Culver's locations. The food and ice cream have always been excellent. They have a nicely diverse menu and of the different items I have tried they always were prepared well. So many times a restaurant with this many different menu items would have some good and some ok, but not Culver's. Don't forget the ice cream!

Maybe I've had too much good BBQ in the Carolina's, Memphis, Texas and Kansas that makes me biased. Picked up a pound of their "Moist Brisket" to take home and pair with my own sides. The brisket was average at best.  I have dined in twice at this location because it's very close to where I live and I have high hopes. The price is not commensurate to a restaurant where, you stand in line to order your food, get served in plastic baskets with butcher paper, eat with plasticware and when all done, clean up after yourself.  Yes I have been to original places where that is how it's done and I don't mind at all. As long as the food is outstanding and not mediocre. This Rudy's franchise location has mediocre food at best.  If you want to taste REAL BBQ try Little Miss BBQ on University. Mind you if you don't get there early enough they may be sold out. And you might have to wait quite awhile in line but for the same money or less in most cases you will be rewarded with OUTSTANDING BBQ. And you will never to be able to be a enjoy a place like Rudy's again.

I found this place to be very clean, well decorated and the food quality excellent; for a fast food place. Order at the counter and they deliver your food quickly, hot and fresh. Service was very friendly. This is where the good part of this review ends.  One draft beer, one soda, a two taco meal and fried calamari meal. Also added a coconut shrimp appetizer at 25% off thanks to Yelp! The grand total... wait for it... $40.  Four stars because service, cleanliness and food quality. Could have been Five Stars if it was price at value which for me would have been about $25.   Probably won't be going back.

Was taken here for my birthday and was our first time in. Couldn't have been more disappointed in almost everything. While true it is a small place they had a table of about 8 which seemed to overwhelm the staff although our server, Ruth, did an admirable job.  We started with the $10 Calamari appetizer. Took awhile and when it came out it was tasteless and rubbery. Our server apologized and graciously offered to replace it. An offer we accepted. Second time, no better and we weren't charged.  Then we shared a small dinner salad which was nice enough although when they say small, they mean it. Served on a small side plate. Was tasty enough but hey, it's assembly and not cooking. Bread and butter were served with the salad. It was nothing special but ok. Hard to believe the bread was made in house as claimed.  Then best of all I ordered the Chef's signature dish, Chef Claudio's Favorite: Sautéed Fresh Mushrooms, Ham, Red Onions and Peas delicately simmered in a rosa cream sauce, baked in an oven with mozzarella cheese. $16.95  Chef's signature dish should be done right shouldn't it? And if you are truly a trained chef specializing in Italian cuisine you wouldn't use ham would you? Or if you DID use ham it wouldn't taste like it was cheap lunchmeat ham would it? It would be some sort of Italian ham like a prosciutto or maybe a capocolla wouldn't it? Nope, just plain old cheap tasting lunchmeat ham.  So mediocre to poor food and a very, very noise kitchen make for a poor meal which we won't attempt to repeat.

This place is AWESOME!!! Great food, friendly staff, good value. Only knocks I have are the place needs to be larger and the self service area could be better. But that's a problem in a lot of places.

Not sure why all of the 5 Star ratings. Food was just average at best and with price considered it's less then average. Fries were meeh, sandwiches the same and service slow. The only saving grace was the pleasant young man who took the order was both knowledgable and courteous. Too much money and slow delivery, not a good combination.  Removed from my bookmarks, won't be going back.
