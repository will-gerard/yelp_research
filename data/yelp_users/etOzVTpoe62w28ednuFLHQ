Best place to ever go on a Tuesday night ! The DJ is always so grimy and the beats are on point. $11 32 oz AMF , also a huge selection for other 32 oz pitchers that are all on a huge chalk board list with all the options you can choose from. I honestly dance so hard with my squad and everyone always has such a good time. Definitely recommend coming after 11:30 pm all the way until 2am!

Everytime I come to Bobby q's it's always super busy! The location is a little hard to find but its off Dunlap and the i17. They have good cocktails drinks that they have prepared for you and I love shock top on draft and they offered it. Very good for ribs, steaks, and all there sides! If you haven't been I definitely recommend stopping by.

Happy hour is from 3pm-7pm and they do have well drinks which is not bad however what Mexican food place doesn't offer chips and salsa when you initially  sit down plus they don't even have taco Tuesday? Service is understaffed and waitress word for word said "I have a lot of tables do you need anything else before I leave because I won't be back soon"? Did she even want a tip? First time and not impressed.

All appetizers are half off including the beer on draft & their unique cocktail menu. Bartenders super friendly, service is usually always quick. The environment is always fun if you sit at the bar and the always have the mystery shots if you're feeling mysterious, definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for a fun bar scene past 10pm. Open until 2am.

Very friendly staff, they have a lot of beer on drafts. They have a mystery shot and it ended up being grey goose melon and it was only $3 a shot. No happy hour on weekends until 10pm-2am. They do have peartini and mellow yellow cocktail for $5 on weekends. Definitely recommend coming in and asking for ARon!

Happy hour specials are outstanding. Always have great service with Jack! Definitely recommend you having him as your server! Shock top is on draft which is always a plus and their fries are beyond organismic in your mouth. Highly recommend stopping in and getting a beer/cocktail and some food!

Happy hour stops at 12 and the service is unbelievably slow and the employees can dance and sing along to the music. Plus my friend just turned 21 at midnight and they don't honor power hour? Don't ever go there

Shock top and well drinks only $2 and open on Thursdays until 2 am on Thursdays and the bartenders are pretty fast on getting you your drink you ordered!

Carne asada meat was very tasty on their chronic nachos I got, they have excellent toppings and many different options to choose on what you want to get like hard/soft tacos, even fries with toppings?! They even had blue moon on draft for 4.75. First time and definitely impressed and recommend this over chipotle any day.
