It's got the Genuine Natural Casing Vienna Dog an the Poppy Seed Bun but they are a 1/8 pound instead of the 1/6 pound so the Dog gets lost on the bun.  If Matt would pony up for the bigger dog I'd give him Five Stars. Four Stars for the dog.  The fries were five stars though. Nice fresh cut wit skins still on and crispy as well.    It's more like Devil Dogs and not The Weiners Circle.  It is Charlotte and not Chicago so I might be a little hard on the place.   They do have Coke on Tap and Mexican Coke in the bottle.  Get the bigger dogs and you can get an extra star.   $7 for the small dog and fries plus drink is a bit on the high side as well.  Since its about a 15 minute walk from the hotel we stay at and no car it will see me for lunch again.

Don is from Chicago. His Partners are Lettuce Entertain You. Chicago boys as well.  This place makes the food desert of Phoenix bearable to live in. I don't have to order food and get it fedex.   You can read the other reviews as most are spot on. Here are a few tips.  If you like ribs that fall off the bone or are really meaty go to Hooters or Famous Daves. These are Ribs like you get at Carsons or Bones in Chicago. In my eyes the best ribs you can get. If you don't like them it is because you don't like Chicago Style. It's you not the ribs.  Everything is now ala carte. The liver. I hate it, my wife loves it. It's not free anymore but it's enough for 3 people.   The meat comes from Stockyards in Chicago. If you were to order them yourself online you will pay more for just the steak than a whole meal here. They are Prime Steaks.   The Skirt Steak is one of my favorites. Again that is if you like skirt steak.  The ribs, I love the ribs, Dons way with sauce on the side.   The wedge salad. Best blue cheese dressing in the world.    The potatoes. Get the Au Gratin. If you like fires get the skinny fries. Instead of steak fries they are fresh cut yet a nice thickness, not skinny like in and out but thinner than Five Guys. I love Five Guys fries by the way. The burgers not so much. The burgers here at D&C are very good though.   The hot fudge sundae is awesome. Really good ice cream homemade hot fudge is to die for and whipped cream is homemade.  Only problem is you don't get enough fudge or cream and they don't give you nuts anymore because of all the folks with allergies.  If you get a steak and it's not the skirt get the filet. Get it medium rare with char crust. If you get it any other way it will either be dry cause it is over cooked or flavorless because they don't use butter or bacon on them to help a fairly tasteless cut of expensive meat. If you get filet at D&C it's because you like filet and love the side dishes and dessert.   The pork chops are not the same as Chicago. They are thin and tough.   It's expensive so share. One dinner is enough for two people to split. My wife and I order the ribs with Au Gratin and a wedge. The only problem is no leftovers. We love the leftovers. There is room for a small hot fudge sundae though.  Go either early or late and sit in the bar area. If their is a sports team or celebrity you will be treated like chopped liver. Don didn't get all those autographs on the wall for nothing. The athletes get served first.

When I walked in the door and saw that the Pizza Oven was one of those conveyor belt ovens I should have gone with my gut feeling and walked away. A real Chicago Pizza is made in an oven with a stone shelf and you need either a pan or peel to get it in and out of the oven.  The hype on the website talks about how the owners wanted to bring Chicago pizza to Phoenix. I have never had Pizza like this in Chicago.   Was it better than Pizza Hut or Barro's? Yes. Was it better than Oregano's or Rosati's. No!  We first ordered an Anti-Pasto Salad with mixed greens. It was a bed of lettuce and spinach with some Italian Meats and Cheeses. Lots of sliced Green and Black Olives and a couple of Peperoncini. Not impressed. Oregano's wins this one hands down.  The pizza. We ordered a Peperoni, Mushroom and Black Olive Pizza. The most notable thing was that the sauce was very sweet, too sweet. Now I've had a sweet sauce ad liked it but this one was overpowering. I prefer a more tart sauce with a more oregano and basil flavor with some spice.  The cheese was good but the mushrooms were canned. The crust was more like a biscuit dough and it was more buttery and flaky than crispy.  If you want a Thin Crust Chicago Pizza with a slightly sweet sauce I would recommend Johnie"s Chicago Pizza on Cave Creek.  Spinato's has Coke and Johnie's has Pepsi and I would go to Johnie's anytime even though he has Pepsi.   To say the least I was very disappointed with Spinato's when there is an Oregano's less than 3 miles away.  One other thing. I ordered my son a Kids Pizza, Drink Dessert and instead of giving me the Kids price they charged me the separate price because they did not see me order it off the kids menu. I asked WTF and they did adjust it when I complained.  To give you an idea of the Chicago Pizza I like for those of you from Chicago to rate my taste here they are. Lou Malnati's or Original Due's Barnaby's. Village Inn, Home Run Inn. Edwardo's, Bacino's. Gigo's Evanston.   In Chicago Rosati's would barely make my list but in Phoenix it's near the top, only second to Oregano's. I do not like anybody's Pan Pizza in Phoenix.  I did forget one thing that was actually very good. The Gelato that came with my son's meal. It was really good. Really good. Not good enough to go back and eat the pizza for though. I have been told the Italian Beef is really good. The same person who told me the pizza was good is the person who said that so I'm not really sure if I want to chance it. What do you think?

There were some good things but none of them were the food.   The decor was spartan but I don't have a problem with that. To me it's all about the food.  It was just some tables and chairs with green table clothes and paper napkins.   The hostess/waitress seated us promptly and took our drink orders right away. She also brought out some bread and butter that was decent but not great.  The pizza on the other tables looked very good and it looked like people were enjoying it.   I am from Chicago so when a place says they are from Chicago I usually give them the benefit of the doubt.  To me that usually means the place has good food. Not as good as it would be in Chicago but better than most Phoenix Italian fare.   I will give you a baseline to compare to since just being from Chicago doesn't mean you know good food.   I like the original Uno's or Due as well as Lou Malnati's. I also like Gullivers if you are from the north side. For thin crust Home Run Inn, Barnaby's and The Spot are all good.   In Phoenix I like Rosati's, Oreganos and Johnny's although if they were in Chicago I wouldn't go to any of them unless very other place I mentioned was closed.  So I saw this place on Check Please AZ and the reviews sounded great and the food looked great. The pizza looked good as well. Even though it isn't what I consider traditional pan pizza it did look good and not all pizza places in Chicago make the Ike Sewell pan type pizza. JBs on Clark long since gone had a good non traditional pan pizza.   That's what I was hoping this was.   So there were four of us and we all ordered something different.   My son ordered the Submarine. It had ham, salami and lettuce on the same Italian role they served cut up for bread. Ok but you could make far better at home or get far better almost anywhere else.  I got the soup to start. It was a Chicken Tortellini. It was ok. Not better than if you bought the fresh Tortellini in the dairy case and added some chicken broth and diced chicken but ok.  My wife and sister got the salads to start. They had a choice of iceberg, romaine or field greens. That was a nice choice as my wife likes weeds and my sister likes romaine. My wife got the blue cheese dressing and my sister got the Italian. My wife commented that the dressings were in little plastic take out cups and how tacky that is. My wife did not like the blue cheese. My sister thought the Italian was OK. Don't get blue cheese at an Italian restaurant. Don and Charlie's or Carson's probably has the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had. That's my comparison for it. A pretty high standard for sure.     I ordered the Chicken Vesuvio. This is something that is special to Chicago. I used to work at the Italian Kitchen in Evanston and the sister restaurant 3 Doors Down used to make a Vesuvio.  I used to eat it once a week. Google it and look at the pictures. If you are the owner of Salerno's then do the same.  The Vesuvio came out and my wife asked why I even tried it. She said if it was on her plate she would have sent it right back. I thought although it didn't look like it should it might have tasted like it should.    It was a boneless chicken breast that looked liked it was boiled in the sauce, which looked more like chicken soup than a soup and wine reduction.   It had mushrooms and onions that were boiled more than saut√©ed as well. The potato wedges were slightly browned but the so called sauce turned them to mush.  The chicken was sliced into bite sized pieces. The first nite was the part of the breast that is all cartilage and gristle. Not good.  The rest of the chicken was like chicken soup meat. I would not ever order this dish here. That is if you go here after reading this. Google Chicken Vesuvio from Harry Caray's. That's what it should look like.   My wife got eggplant Parmesan. Since I didn't try it he comment was it was mediocre.   My sister ordered Chicken Francaise. Google that as well. The chicken she got looked more like a Chicken Schnitzel. They put the sauce on the side. The sauce was really bad. No lemon at all.  She also got a side of over cooked pasta. The red sauce was very good though.    I also ordered a pizza. After all, that is what they consider their specialty. I got a baby pan pepperoni and mushroom.  It looked really good. Sadly it wasn't. I actually had to add salt. The crust really had potential but it needed to be a bit crisper. It also needed a bit more sauce that had a bit more spice. It was better than. Papa Johns or Domino's. Maybe the thin crust would have been better.  So my wife asks both me and my sister why we don't send our dishes back. We have no problem sending anything back from good restaurants and they always make it right. Here what we had was a difference in what we considered good food. Some people like Arby's. Some people like Chipotle. I do like Chipotle by the way.  We paid our $100 bucks and were very disappointed. For not much more we could have gone to Don and Charlie's

I used to come here for lunch and had never had a bad meal. So we decided to come for dinner.  It was bad, really bad. We ordered  potstickers. These were like the cheapest pre made potstickers you could buy at Samsclub. And they were cooked till they were limp and flavorless.   Then we got the Satay Chicken. Again something that started out frozen from a bag and cooked till it was rubbery and tasteless. Hands down the worst satay I have ever had.  Then I ordered a beef dish. Tough, chewy and stringy.  Not one of the 4 of us had anything we would ever say I'd eat that again.  For lunch I used to get the Shrimp Pad Thai. And I used to enjoy it. After a dinner like that though I'll never come back.  The service was good. That's it.

This is a review more about service than products. You can buy their products online at a discount so you might just want to do that.  I went in on a Saturday without an appointment and if the Barber had time I thought I would try a Royal Shave. I have seen some reviews and needed a shave an a haircut so I thought I would give it a try. If they had an opening sometime that day.  They didn't even have a Barber. Even if it was his day off you think they would have someone who works Saturday.   So much for trying the Royal Shave.   But that wasn't the worst of it. There was one guy on what is normally the busiest day in the mall. There were 3 or 4 people in there looking for advice. He did a pretty good job because when he got done with a guy not looking to buy but just looking he told me he would be with me shortly and took the next guy. While he was writing him up in comes another guy who walked into the Barber Room. I thought this guy was the barber and he was the one who told me it was his day off.  He then walked away and started doing something behind the counter. Not a can I make you an appointment. Do you have any questions, is there something else you needed. Did the other guy tell him I was waiting for some answers. Nope.  My wife had bought me a Travel Kit and when I was listening to the guy who just bought product he was getting the travel kit for free. Don't know what he bought to get it but I'm willing to bet my wife could have probably bought something. I could have used for just a couple bucks more and got the freebie.   One other thing. This place is called the Art of Shaving. Neither of the two guys there were shaved. They were groomed, not shaved. They had well trimmed beards and Full. Handle Bar Mustaches. How do you call that shaving?  Shaving involves risk. LOL there needs to be a place on your face where hair grows and it is scraped off with  a very sharp blade. Maybe they shave, just not where anybody can see it.  The next time I need a haircut I might still give them a try. After all, the. Barber could do a great job and the Royal Shave might be worth it. But as far as product goes. Use the store to browse and then buy online.   For my review of the product and why. I'm interested in shaving at all check out my blog.  http://thinkcostnotprice.blogspot.com/2014/09/shaving-low-cost-of-going-old-school.html  Buy the way. When I left I proceeded over to V's Barbershop at Fulton Ranch. Lourdes gave me a haircut, shave and got my shoes shined all for $45 plus tip. I will review that next. But it will be 4 stars. Not perfect but it could be minus a few misunderstandings.

The owner is from Chicago so he knows what Chicagoans like. Stick to the Mediterranean specialities and you can't go wrong. My favorite is the Gyros it's sliced off the vertical broiler like it should be. Nice and thin.  Its Kronos so you know what your getting.  The shawirma is made in house with either chicken or beef. The beef comes from Midwestern Meats.   The hummus is as good as it gets. The Greek Salad is dressed just right with an oil and lemon concoction.   If your looking for a Hot Dog it's ok. It's Vienna but not a natural casing.   If you get the Italian Beef and your from Chicago you will probably be disappointed. It's not Al's or Portillo's.   The fries are crinkle cut and crispy.   You can get a pita combo for about $8 that includes fries or salad and a drink or a plate combo that is almost enough for two for just a couple dollars more.   It's also a good place for kids. My 8 year old loves a Gyro.  Service is great as well. At least during the  week.

Since my last rating I have ventured out to even more items. I love the Chicken Souvlaki. The Plate is a great deal. Better than the Pita Meal. You get a lot of meat, a salad, side and a drink all for a few bucks. Get a Combo or Supreme Plate and have enough to eat for lunch and dinner.   I eat her sometimes 3 times a week. And I see a lot of the same faces every time. Lots of people eat here many times a week.   On a diet, get a salad with your favorite meat. Small or Large.  It's not fancy but it's good and it's inexpensive.   Every week a friend and I meet for lunch and get a Supreme Combo Plate. Chicken Souvlaki, Hummus, Chicken Shawarma and Kofta Kabob. Add and extra pita and an extra drink and it's less than $20 bucks.

Let me start by saying I would definitely eat here again. They have two things I really like, good food and Coke products.  Having lived in Chicago most of my life I am very hard on restaurants.   This one has many good qualities.   The owners actually work there. This was the first time I ate here even though I had been by it many times. Once I even looked at the menu. It did not have Saganaki on it so I did not go in. I continued to eat at The Big Ft Greek although in the past year the quality had gone down and the prices had gone up.  Now back to Pitta Souvli. It is in a strip mall hidden in the back where they probably don't get any drive by traffic unless someone is looking to buy a bicycle next door.  My friend and I started off with the Hummus. It was a decent size serving for 2-3 people for about $4. The taste was good and it did have the slight sesame flavor of real hummus.  The next thing we got was the Egg Lemon Soup. A Chicken and Rice Soup ($3.50 for a cup) with egg and lemon. Very good flavor and not over salted.   I had the Beef Souvli or Beef Kabob Sandwich $6.50. The beef was flavorfull and tender and not one piece had that vein or fat that you get in many sandwiches. The seasoning was very good and not overpowering.  My friend had the Gyro $5.50 and Fries $2.50. Again very good flavor and not supper greasy. The fries were crispy and seasoned with season salt. Not too thin or too thick.   The service was excellent and the prices were reasonable.   While we were their we met the owner and his wife. They had both met working for Big Fat Greek. George was from Cypress. He told us that most of his employees have been there since they started over a year ago. They have many specials and everything is made fresh. They do have Saganaki. It is a special item that is only on the menu a couple of times a week but if you ask for it they will make it anytime. They age their own cheese for it on the premises.   Next time I am going to try the Lamb Souvli as George promises that it is some of the most tender lamb you will ever eat. I would also like to try the Greek Potatoes as well.   Please eat here as many of the places I like cannot survive in a city were everybody prefers National Chains over quality family owned businesses.  If you care about decor as well as food you will like this place as well. Me, I just care about the food and not the atmosphere. Being from Chicago I'll eat food standing up at a counter in a modified garage if the food is good.  Eat here. If your disappointed you have no Idea what good food should taste like.

Could have been five stars but there was a bit of a language barrier.   On Saturdays they don't take appointments and many people wait for a specific person but I called and they said that the wait was only a few minutes.  I had looked at the website and they offered something they called the works.  Shave, Haircut and Shoeshine. $45  So I walk in, hand the shoeshine guy my shoes and walk to the counter to check in.  The girl behind the counter asks me if I want a haircut. I say the works. She says that it will be just a few minutes so sign in. I do and before I write my last name she says Lourdes is ready for me.   I go back and she asks "haircut"?  I say no, the works.  I sit down and she asks howI like my haircut? After telling her she goes to work.  She does a good job but no shampoo. Then she says your done. I say, I wanted the works. Thinking when something like that happens you are just better off walking a way. Or at least that's my usual experience. But like the trusting fool I am I tell her that I wanted the Works. And the haircut was good. If it sucked that would have been the end.  So she proceeds to get me prepped for the shave. I highly recommend it and Lourdes. She did a very good job and took her time. Not a single nick.   Especially if you have a pair of shoes that need shining. If not call me and you can take mine in. LOL I rarely get my shoes shined because I'm lazy and cheap.  But they do need it. Far more often that the once very 6 months when I have it done at the airport.  I consider myself lucky that I let her continue and The Art of Shaving didn't have a Barber on duty today.   Lourdes has only been here 7 weeks but she used to work at the shop at Chandler mall so she isn't a novice. I've seen a couple of reviews on here where people are not at all satisfied with the "new girl". Not sure if that was her but I think she did a good job if it was. I got #4 clipper on the sides. Square neck and trimmed on the top.  No complaints. If my wife complains when she sees it I will update.

This place is tucked in a corner next to Home Depot where you might never see it.   It has a nice clean casual atmosphere. The service was friendly and very attentive. We went at around 1:30 on a Friday afternoon and the place was busy but not full.  There were no lunch special combos but the prices were not what you would consider dinner prices either.   We started with the Chicken Potstickers. 6 good sized pieces to an order for $3.95. I'm not usually a fan of chicken in a potsticker but these were very good.  Then my son ordered the Mongolian Beef and I ordered the Pad Thai. Yeah, I know that the Pho is the way to go. They even have Pho in the name right. But I did not feel like a really big bowl of soup although it did look very good at the tables around us.   The Beef was to sweet and a bit tough. It was OK but I would not order it again. Neither would my son. He didn't like it at all. He did eat all the rice and had three of the potstickers so he had enough.  The Pad Thai. Actually quite good although it could have had more shrimp and less tofu.  It only had 4 medium shrimp that were a little chewy. Now while the shrimp were tough and slim Pickens the noodles, sauce and other ingredients were very good and very fresh.  Better than Pei Wei for sure as the noodles were not under cooked and over seasoned.  I will definitely will be back as its very close to home and its also pretty good. I got some Spring Rolls to go and will have them tomorrow with my leftovers.   As for a good lunch combo I recommend Thai Rama on Chandler Blvd by Dobson. They have a very good Pad Thai  Combo that includes Soup, and a so so fried spring roll for about the same price.  I'm giving them 4 stars for overall experience and since they are Vietnamese they do a pretty good Thai and Chinese Potsticker.   The spring rolls look really good as well.

It's been a long time since I have eaten here. The service is prompt yet cold.  The food though is good. It's New York Cantonese. Not quite as good as Chicago but close.  I always get a combination meal as it's always a pretty good value.  Today I  had the Shrimp wit Garlic Sauce.   5 or 6 good sized shrimp and a good mix of vegetables.  I was not disappointed.  I had the BBQ Pork Fried rice which is also better than average. As one other person put it. no carrots or peas. It should be scallions and bean sprouts. There were scallion but no sprouts.  The egg roll is not great but no worse than any other Chinese place in AZ.  We also had the szechuan dumplings. They were ok. basically steamed won tons with a peanut sauce. I prefer their potstickers.  Their best deals are lunch specials. Pretty much the same thing you get at dinner but $6 instead of $9.

I'd give it 5 but it's only great, not perfect.  The owner really takes pride in his product and the employees have been there for years.  My family and I have never had a meal there we did not like.   They also don't mind when you ask for something done your way, not theirs.  First of they bring you fresh homemade bread. Yeah, they make it from scratch.  Their Minestrone is very good.   Their pizza is very good as well. I order it a little thinner, a little more crispy and a little less cheese. Really.  Great sauce, crust and toppings.   They might have a pan but I have never asked. I have never had a good pan pizza outside of Chicago. Never. Not even from a restaurant  that says they are a Chicago place.  I have also never found a good egg roll outside of Chicago either but that not Frank's problem.  I have also had the Chicken Vesuvio. Good but not great. The best Vesuvio is made with bone in chicken and baked, not grilled. But this is AZ so what do you want.  The Canolli , yum. The other deserts are pretty good as well.  So far this is the best Chicago transplant I have found. Better than Rosati's or Oreganos. I'm lucky it's not closer to my house. If it was Id be as fat as one of their Jumbo Pies.  It is one of my three top Chicago Places.

What it's not. Al's on Taylor street. Not be sue the food isn't good. It doesn't have a great location and it's not a made over garage with no restroom.  What it does have is one of the best Italian Beefs in Phoenix.  I get it sweet and dipped.   And the fries. If you like fresh cut fries and I do, this is the place. Whenever I'm in Scottsdale which is about once a week I drop by and say Hi to Barry and get my Chicago fix.  I also get the Jumbo Char Dog. This is one Hot Dog. While the regular dog is a natural casing Vienna Dog the Jumbo Char Grilled is as good as it gets.  I grew up on places they Fluky's and Weiners Circle as well as Mustards Last Stand just to name a few.   My Chicago food cred is second to none.  In Chicago my Beef priority would be Al's, Mr Beef, Luke's and then a few real mom and pops like Roma's or Captain Nemo's. actually Captain Nemo's was pretty good yet not what I would call a traditional Beef.   Anyway I digress. Just like in Chicago my first choice for Beef would be Al's, second when I'm near downtown or Chandler it would be Luke's and just like in Chicago the only time I would go to Portillos is when every one else that has a good beef is closed.   One piece of advice for people who have tried an Italian Beef and didn't like it. If they had a sign saying they serve Vienna Italian Beef. That has to be some of the worst Beef and Gravy made. The thing about all the other Beef Places I mentioned in AZ is that they make their own. The only Beef I would by that is a Name Brand would be Scala. Have never seen a place in Phoenix that has it.  And is it just me or has Oregano's gone downhill in the last year.  Al's is still number one, even in Phoenix. just like in Chicago.

Small place with marginal service but good food.  Had the Hot and Sour Soup. Not too hot or too sour.   Steamed dumplings. The filling was pork and bok choy. It was very light and tasty.  House Special Noodles.  Good flavor and large portion. Could have put in a couple more shrimp. But good food overall and reasonably priced. We will be back.  Andrew S is right on the money with his review. We sat in the exact same booth.   Also ordered a Coke and with the second one had to ask for more ice.  What is it with Chinese places and ice?  My wife ordered a diet coke and got diet Pepsi.  Not the same thing.

If you like a lot of cheese this is your kind of pizza place.   Scratch that. I like the right cheese to crust ratio. I also like my cheese more than just melted.  Amalfi has all the right tools but can't build my kind of pizza.  They have a real oven with a stone deck. If I ever see one of those Domino or Papa John type of pizza ovens I walk out. That's why no Spinattos or Rush St Pizza for me.  They have a good crust and a good sauce. Even the pepperoni is good.   But with the pounds of cheese they put on a pizza, it just can't cook to the right texture in a brick oven at a super high heat. It just melts into a big mess.  Sad to say but for the price I would rather go to Papa Murphy and take and bake.  But that's just me. If you like your pizza swimming in cheese, so much so that if you tilt the pizza slightly it will all pool to me side then this is your place.

Four Stars for a place in an airport. Yes.   Every once in a while I get a 2 hour or more break between flight so I get to sit down and eat.   Usually in Charlotte I go to Carolina BBQ or Bojangles. They are fast and easy to eat once your flying. And also tasty but average.   Anyway back to the burger.   Decent bun. Good size patty. About 1/3 pound. Got cheddar and bacon with mushrooms. Asked for medium rare and got it medium rare. And to the person whose bottom bun was soggy. That's what you get with a good juicy not overcooked burger.   The fries were a bit to the cold side but they were still good.   Price. It was $16 with a drink and tax but what do you expect for a sit down place with a wait staff. So add tip to that as well.   It's not BK or Mc Ds. You have to pay if you want good food.   To me it was worth  the $20.

Why on earth would I give this place four stars you ask? Pizza snob that I am. From Chicago as well.  Because for $5 you can pick up a Pepperoni Favorite deal any day of the week. I think they also have the deal for Sausage or Sausage and Pepperoni as well but, I'm just buying the base.   Instead of paying $10 or more for extra ingredients you can take home the "Fave" and put whatever you want on it.   We add our own mushrooms, onions and peppers. Or whatever else we have in the fridge about to go bad if we don't eat it in the next few days.  The only better deal is when Sprouts across the street has a half price sale on Home Run Inn Frozen Pizza.

I've been meaning to review Buddyz for a while now as I have eaten here there times already.   The place has been packed every time we have been here. I have never seen a place where people buy far more pizza than they could ever eat. You will see a table of 4 with three pizzas, and large pizzas at that.  Is it that good?  Well, maybe. It is probably the best pizza I have had in Phoenix.  The place is just a big room with a bunch of tables and a bar. Not a problem. The service is friendly but really slow. And not just because the pizza takes a while to cook, I expect that. Maybe they should ditch the POS system and just turn in tickets like in the old days. They spend far to much time staring at the screen than needed.  For you beer drinkers they have local craft beers that change weekly. They also have Old Style if you really miss Chicago.  But let's get to the pizza. Their thin crust is very thin and very crisp. Very good. There is ample sauce, cheese and great ingredients.  This is very good pizza. In my opinion better than Oregano's or Rosatti's. Think Rosatti's on steroids..  Now the pan, it's not Malnatti's but it is a very acceptable alternative. Again they get the bottom of the crust very crisp and the sauce on the top is very good with very tasty ingredients. The sauce is thicker, more like Gino's East or Giordano's.   If you like a good full bodied sausage you will like theirs. The pepperoni is also very good and the vegetables are fresh. No canned mushrooms or peppers here.  I have never had the Butter Crust. That's because Chicago Pizza does not use butter in the crust. Yes, Malnatti's has it but it's a request, not their normal crust or anyone else's. They don't use corn meal in the dough either. Not real Chicago. Some places use corn meal to dust the bottom so the dough doesn't stick to the peel but not in the dough.   The crust is made with corn oil. Lot's of it. That and crushed tomatoes on top of the cheese is what sets it apart from Sicilian Pizza.   My son like their Italian Beef. Not as much as Portillo's but it's acceptable. What is interesting is that every time we have been there, they bring our pizza and forget to bring my sons beef.    This is now our first choice for Saturday Pizza night but the 15 mile drive sort of sucks.    They have a loyalty program where if you come back in one week you get 20% off, two weeks 15% off or three weeks 10% off. Actually that's pretty annoying as their pizza is not cheap by any stretch.   I don't mind paying for good food but they should just lower the prices 10% across the board.  Like today I'm out of town so now I have to pay more. It's almost a negative incentive.   You will easily pay $20 plus a pizza.   Maybe one reason people order more than they can eat, it still tastes really good reheated the next day.  If I were in Chicago and wanted thin crust I would go to Buddyz. It's that good.  The pan wouldn't be on my radar in Chicago but in Phoenix it's probably number one.  Their menu is fairly limited. If you have people who want an entree you should go to Bacci. Also very good pizza but different. See my review of them if you want to compare and decide.  There is one other reason they might sell so much pizza. They are right next door to a Weed Store and everybody might just have the munchies.

I don't usually review Fast Food because it is what it is.   But, this chicken is really bad.   I got the Chicken Tender Meal.   While the breading was tasty the chicken was tasteless. It really had no taste. Just sort of a firm fleshy feel but no taste.   It would have been tastier if it was battered tofu.   Don't waste the money or the calories on this place.   It should go from the fryer straight to the trash.   I haven't had Popeyes in years but I don't remember being this bad.
