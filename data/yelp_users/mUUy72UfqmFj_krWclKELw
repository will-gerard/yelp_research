this place isn't all that it's hyped up to be. lots of people say "this is the best place for chinese" it really isn't people. i've had better from, i'm embarrassed to admit - pei wei. i had the beef pad thai which was watery and bland. it seemed like they just added a load of hot-spices to cover up the watery substance. it was just awful! the server took a long time to refill my water while my mouth was on fire,  i'm never going back to this place again.     this place is too small to bring in a 10 person group, so don't.  sorry Fate i know you mean well to the asian cuisine community, but you're not worth my presence.

the food was delightful! i've eaten here twice and enjoyed it! the service was very friendly and good place to sit down with your friends and just yap away about your horrible day. the food will cure away your hard day at the office. if not then just go to taco bell and call it a night.   i also  like the setting inside, it's lighting is a great place to take out a date if both of you are adventurous about trying out a totally different place to eat. HURRY they're closing in October as Bobby Q. stated on his post.   I will try to go there before their doors are shut for good. :(

I love the food here!!! usually get the Pollo Cubano which is delicious. I also like getting the Plantanes (look at the pictures, it's the one with the fried bananas) the bean dip is out of this world! i usually take my friends here to eat and they all seem to like it. this is also a nice place to take that special someone out on a lovely date. it's relaxing and the valet parking makes it seem like you're a million bucks. hahaha

i love buffalo wings from this place. i like it extra crispy and light on the sauce, which is perfect!!!  the service is great and quick with the check.  tuesdays are even better because it's wing day!! meaning it's 35cent a wing (i think)

I love this place!! Their breakfast is amazing! The location is a little hard to find, but it's worth the search. The interior design is very neat, they have faux finished on their wall, it makes it seem like you're in Tuscany. hahaha or maybe not. I would suggest everyone at least try this place once. It's just a good place to enjoy a great morning breakfast.

A Newly Found Treasure and I came here last night to try it out. I was not disappointed.  It was the first time I've ever eaten Vietnamese food and first time i had Pho. I thought the food was good. I like the Spring Roll. It was fresh and savory. The mint that was inside the roll gave it that zing taste and and burst of surprise. The #10 Pho I ordered was delightful. I finished everything except for the soup!!!  The people were also friendly. Our server made sure we knew what we were ordering and told us the ingredients in the soup. I eat anything and everything!!   Nice atmosphere and a homey feel. I'll definitely come back here again.   The place is located in the Iguana Macks plaza just after Knox.

So every time I'm craving some pho I always come back here. 90% of the time I go by myself. It's easier than trying to convince someone else to go with me.   The pho is always delicious and the service is always quick! I sometimes wonder if the servers understand what I'm saying, but I'm glad the numbering system is implemented here, "#10 Please. Thank you." I should try to learn some Vietnamese basics since that's my number one place to go.

I've been here a couple of times and the one on Gilbert Rd.  I thought the lay out of this one is very neat. it's right next to a lake where lots of people like to congregate, tables are provided outside. the only downside to the layout is the parking lot design. it gets cramped (see photo). i usually park outside the "cramped" area... try not to hit anything when trying to pull out of your spot. other than that i think the coffee is great!!! customer service is great and the people are friendly. good place to socialize and relax.   one bad thing about their credit/debit card service is that you have to have a minimum of $3.99 in order for you to use your plastic. just keep that in mind when you want a 16oz vanilla latté. which came out to $3.62.

I remember when this place use to be located on Dobson and Southern (NW corner) and then it grew up to an adult and here it is, busy than ever! I love coming here when i need to. You can practically get anything "asian" at this place and GOYA! Their competition is Mekong down the street, but I think Lee Lee is holding its own with its loyal customers and wide variety of sale items.   I would definitely recommend coming here even if you need meats and vegetables - cheap! Like most Asian markets I've been to, it does have that stintch of weird odor expelling from the walls. But after awhile, you get use to it. :)   They have a Filipino section - LOVE IT - get some Datu Puti and Silver Swan!! :)

this place gets packed during lunch time  hours. the food is great and friendly customer service. I ordered a 3 and to me it seemed like it was a 4 or 5, it was hot but i love spicy food. the server had to keep bring me water to cool me down a notch, my forehead created a puddle on sweat on the floor it was that spicy but sooo good!   you sure can find me back there again.   they do have lunch specials so take advantage of it!!!

I've tried lots of Thai restaurants in the East Valley and a couple in Phoenix. I have to say that Mint Thai is the best!! Like someone said earlier, it is in a location that isn't admirable but when you walk inside it's very welcoming.   I took my friend here and he has never had Thai before and after that he said he was a fan. The service is always good. We didn't wait very long till we received our orders.  I'm very lucky for this place to be located in the East Valley.  I ordered the Rama Beef which I always get every time I come here. It has a peanut buttery flavor which engulfed my pallet, I smooth and the seasonings are just perfect. My friend had the Sizzling Beef, I've never had it before but it was really good. They bring out a HOT skillet and place the vegetable and beef on it and watch it sizzles!! It was way cool! Be careful though it's still hot, wait a few minutes.   The music they play is Thai which gives it that ambiance of Asia... I guess. I do want their CDs though even though I don't know what their saying!!  ALSO most Thai restaurants close between 2-4pm this little one is open from 11AM-9PM no breaks in between. I've had this problem before where I'm craving Thai between 2-4pm and no one seems to be open, it's a pain!!

This place beats Starbucks any day! Their coffee is delightful. The people are very welcoming. For the people that stop in on a daily basis, the baristas know their drink and name. To me that is the most important in developing great customer service and relationships. Free wi-fi makes this place even better. Friendly customers and just great ambiance.  Yelp can't seem to change the correct address of this place. this place, if you don't know already, it's located on NE corner of Val Vista and Guadalupe where the McDonalds is.

So my friends took me here as a "farewell" dinner get-together. I didn't know what to expect. My friends go there on  a weekly basis, they're practically regulars... NO KIDDING!!   From what they were telling me, if you become a regular there they can practically make anything that's NOT in the menu for you.   Our server Allissa was SOOOO AWESOME!!! I've never been to a restaurant in AZ where the server interacts with their customers on a personal level. It made the place more appealing so in the future, I can take my friends there for sushi.   Thank you guys for the welcoming atmosphere.

This place is soo neat and cozy!  I love coming here before I go to work or during my lunch break. I usually get their Caramel Latté and their Chocolate Homemade Scones. Their scones are delicious and moist, I seriously could eat them all day long!   The people there are really nice, very helpful, and polite. They know how to treat their customers.   I would definitely come back here again!  I like how they keep you in their database so that the 10th drink you order is FREE. Most places make you carry a stamp-card, but this place is a little more techy coz it's all computerized. NEATO!

A friend took me to this place and I was really impressed at how the employees really take care of their regulars and make them welcome. This place isn't cheap if you come 3-4 times a week to shoot your frustrations away at a standing target.   This place even has an ELITE level, but you have to pay a certain amount of money to participate. The ELITE members do get their private room and in order for you to enter, they have a retina-eye scanner. It sound really fancy and chic... can you call a gun club CHIC? mmhmm...   Anyway, I would definitely come back here and shoot some round with my friend. With friendly people always very welcoming no wonder this place keeps on rockin'!

bank building turn to a coffee beanery is way cool.   plenty of seats to settle yourself in and crack open your books and do your homework. the free wi-fi is helpful too, but the connection lags sometimes when their a bunch of people hopping online to check their myspace.  it gets chilly at time, i suggest bring a sweater if you're the unlucky one seated underneath the A/C vent.   the vault room is great when trying to escape the loud chatter in the main room, just don't forget to turn off your cell phone when you're in there, it's kind of rude...  if you wanna be shaking out of your pants, i suggest the Iced Toddy. it's strong and it should keep you up all night if you have a big project the following day.  customer service is very nice and helpful.

I've never had Indian cuisine before and a friend of mine has been craving it since he left the UK. So, we opted for Royal Taj. Since I am an Indian cuisine virgin, it wasn't a bad place to eat.   My friend and I had the Tandoori Chicken dish. I thought it was really good!! I ordered the "half" serving and it was quite filling. I even had to get a to-go box. The Naan bread was really good!   My friend told me something was missing with the dish. He said "the Tandoori Chicken dish usually comes with curry sauce..." (from his past experience). For him it wasn't that good compared to the Indian cuisine is Britain.  But for a "virgin" like me it was GREAT!!

this place is HOT in all aspects. their chicken is damn good and the atmosphere in the place does get a little too hot at times. it's awesome though! i like the friendly service they provide.   the food is very RICH especially their iced tea, it's like drinking pure sugar, soooo good... sometimes - like once a year. but other than that the food is great!! i suggest trying it out and see for yourself. i love fried chicken and waffle so i can't really complain. their corn bread is good too! it makes me salivate just thinking about the greasiness. YUMMM!!!

it's apparent that this place use to be a bank, but after stepping inside you don't even notice you just stepped into a bank. it's like you just stepped inside a restaurant in italy. haha not really but the feeling takes over.  the service was great!! they were so nice and very knowledgeable. when i was there one of the servers dumped a whole tray of drink on to this customer's table. the customers were understandable about the whole situation. her co-workers helped her out and didn't leave her hangin', that's always nice....  the food was great!! it was VERY good!! i had the Veal with Lemon and Artichoke YUMMMMY!!! and my sister had the Cataloni that was heavenly good!  i'll post pics later, but that place was really good. i would so go back there for dinner.  WAY TO GO RIGATONY'S!!!!

The young hip mom that cuts my hair is AWESOME!! I always go to her. She been cutting my hair for the last 2 years. Her name is ANESSA!! Ask for her. She use to work at Steven Paul Salon in Scottsdale.  When you go inside it seems really BIG because of the mirrors that are plastered throughout the place. It's a good place to mingle, but most of the people their god there for a specific stylist, but I think they have walk-ins.   Like what Aimee said "this place is a hidden gem".

i've been here on several occasions. friendly staff and fresh bagels. i went used the drive through yesterday morning and they gave me my bagel in a jiffy. fast service!!  the only thing about bagel joints is that they practically slather a pound of cream cheese on your bagel no matter if you go here or Einstein's... one bad this about this place is that every time i get a half dozen bagels i get charge a totally different prices (on 3 occasions) what's up with that? at least keep a consistent price on your bagels. ugh!!  i still love this place though... i especially love cinnamon-sugar bagel, it's got that caramelize sugar on there and when you take a bite it'll crackle. it's pure goodness.

This place is way neat. It reminds me of a restaurant that I went to in Burlington, Vermont - that very outdoorsey and hippie feel. It's not your local IHOP but it's fancied by the college students around the area... especially after a hang over the night prior. Their greasy potato will cure the most devastating hang over!!   My friend and I would always go here after his long night after the bar. We could go in our pajamas or sweats and no one would really care. Most of the people that go there on a Saturday morning are people who just woke up so don't be haters... we are college students after all.   Every time I go, the service was always really good even though it was a busy Saturday morning.   I would say everyone should try this place at least once and see for yourself.

Came here Saturday night around 9PM, to our surprise it wasn't too busy. While my friend and I waited to be seated, we were lounging on an amazing incline chair that viewed the amazing Phoenix sky.  My friend and I were seated in less than 10 minutes. We were seated outside which was nice, but it felt like we were in the way of everyone's way, but besides that, the place was nice. Our server was ok, nothing too spectacular, I've had better.   The art was neat as well! This place was a good place to be "seen" if you get my drift, but the food was just like everything else. I wouldn't mind coming back here to be "seen" and have a couple of cocktails.

So the crepes at this place was good and the price wasn't over the top. I got the Toulous crepe with pepperoni, sausage, cheese, mushrooms, with tomato sauce. It was a hearty meal for the price I paid for it. The service was quick.  Every time I'd walk pass this place, I would always see a mass amount of people huddling over this little place. Now I can see why.   If you're on a budget in Vegas, I suggest coming here for your meals, but if you're not, then there's plenty of things to indulge on the Strip.

It's my first time here and the only thing I was impressed about what that the establishment is located in an old gas station.   The people working here are not too personable when talking with customers. I understand they might get tired of doing that for 5 hours, but if their friends come in leaning and hanging out on the counter while talking to the employees for half hour or more. Then it's time to get re-train some of these workers to be more customer oriented because they're losing focus. They're talking loud on the phone while on shift - pretty much everyone in the place could hear her business.  The coffee was "ok" nothing too special - I like that bitter/sweet taste in my drink, but that wasn't present.   The custom art on the walls are neat and makes the atmosphere of the place more welcoming, but there's a disconnect between that and the worker's attitude. I wouldn't mind coming back to this place and giving them another try... I'll re-review until then.

This place has delightful ambiance. It's very date-friendly. I sat in one of the tables with the RED CHAIR. The proportion was a little odd. The chair was too tall and its arms kept touching the table. It made it was hard to maneuver my arms around it.   Our server was very nice. She seemed to be knowledgeable about their menu, which is very important.   I ordered the Grilled Burrito with the Pork it was delicious!!  I love the chips and the 3 sauces that come with it. very tasty.

I expected the theater to be clean when picking out a seat, but no it looked like it hasn't been cleaned for hours. There was popcorn on the seats, trash on the floor, and wrappers all over the place.   I've been to some better AMC but this one was just BAD! The bathrooms looked like it hasn't been cleaned since they open their doors that morning.

I'm reviewing both the bookstore and the Starbucks that is located in the store.  The bookstore is huge, great selection on books, and the people there are very helpful. They have great periodical selections and a good place to just relax and read a good article - even though you should really buy it rather than reading it there.   Now for the Starbucks in the store.  Note: I'm not really a big Starbucks reviewer, but this one is an exception.   I was there tonight, reading some periodicals on the comfy chair that's laid out throughout the store. I kept hearing the guy behind the counter - Daniel (I asked for his name while ordering a cup of java). Anyway, I was amazed at how great he was interacting with every customer walking up to the counter. He was very friendly, charming, and a great sales guy promoting their Venti size drinks for 25¢ more... great tactic! I fell for it. :) After I ordered my coffee and cookie, I sat there observing his people skills and he was just GREAT! The way he spoke to everyone seemed like he knew who they were and by hearing him, I could just tell he was good at talking to people.   He did a great job making people's drink quickly and calling the customer by their name when their drinks were ready.   5 Star for Daniel @ Starbucks.

WOW!! This place is awesome. I love local coffee establishments. The place had a really homey feel to it. The art design on the wall gave the place a unique feel. They're hand drawn and painted, which separates itself from the Starbucks mass-produced art work.   I loved the fact they used Pandora as their music source. Lots of great collection from indie musicians.   I ordered the 12oz Mocha which was very delightful to the palette. It was smooth and refreshing, it didn't have that burn taste. It was just great! Their menu is VERY healthy.  The owners are very welcoming and great to talk to. I like how they interact with the customers which give it that personal connection. I'm definitely going back to this place it's just a GREAT place to hang!!  This place has potential. They are expanding their menu so watch for goodies within the next couple of months. They buy a lot of their produce from local farms which help sustain the community - I'm a big fan of that!!

I like coming to Tempe Town Lake to relax and walk around. It's quiet enough so that you can listen to the airplanes approaching . It's a good place to get to know someone special. This is the closest we'll get to "walks on the beach".   It's just a good place to hang out. Enjoy the nice quiet site of the lake.

Chodang, je t'aime.   I at least have to come here every couple of weeks or else I start talking in my sleep about Korean food. :)  I've been here so many times, I've had #41, #23, #24, and the Udon noodle. SOOO good!   The only thing I wish they would do different is play some Korean-pop music or some Korean music. The food is magnificent and the kimchi is delightful. I will definitely come back here whenever I have Korean cravings. Till next time...

I love this place!!  I miss my Chodang dearly. It's been approximately 4 months since my last chow-down. Now I can come back every other week and enjoy some great Korean food once again. I really should try everything on the menu. Today's order was #8 the one before that was #21. I did enjoy the octopus dish... I'm salivating thinking about it.

my sister and a few friends went for a morning road bike ride to this place.  the food was great and light but yet filling. i didn't feel like i ate a pan of grease after eating here. it was a good quality, healthy breakfast.   the customer service was great!! they were really friendly and helpful with what we needed.   i will definitely come back to this place and enjoy myself a honey cured-ham with apple and brie cheese breakfast. YUMMMY!!!

the last time i came here was when they were still located in Tempe, on University and Hardy so i don't know if they've changed their ways or not, but i'm going to go off of what i've experience thus far.  this place is AMAZING!!! i've never eaten Israeli food and when I first tried this place i was taken back on how excellent their food is. I think you have to have a sense of adventure when trying out this place, i say that because i took a friend of mine to this place who i thought would've been a little daring to try something new. he said he didn't care too much for it. just a fare warning to anyone you're thinking about taking there....  when i went there for the first time, i had no idea what i was gonna order and they were really helpful and suggested a meal that would acquire my taste and i was not disappointed. the customer service was very helpful and very kind. i can't wait to go back to this place!!!

this place is awesome! i had a hard time finding this place due to the trees covering its entrance, but it was worth it!   the service was friendly.   they had free wifi, but they have very limited outlets for laptop chargers. you can also sit outside and enjoy the quiet evening or inside where comfy chairs are provided for your pleasure. it's great for meeting with friends or a study session with your group.   it got kinda hot in there which was the downside to my visit, but other than that it was a memorable experience.

I've been to a few tea places before. This one is nothing special. They have overpriced drinks. The service wasn't that great. It took 8 minutes for them to make our drinks and it was just me and a friend in the entire store!!! We were like "How long does it take to make iced tea? It's taking quite awhile for them to hand over our drinks! what's the deal!?"   I wouldn't mind coming back here and trying them out again. I mean, the place was really nice, clean and appropriate setting was illustrated with their decor and design. *thumbs up*

I stopped in here a couple of days ago after the Yelp Office Hours. I had to get some gift card/coffee money for a friend of mine that moved to Oregon. I hear they are popular up there.   The guys who served me were awesome!! The only reason I went there was to grab the coffee money and run, but Ryan and David kept my attention. I told them I've never had Dutch Bros before, so they gave me a small sample of their delicious coffee. Even though I was already caffeined out I gave it my all to take a sip, I mean it was nice of them to make a free sample for me...  They made the Kaluah Kicker (which is awesome ICED!) and to my surprise it was really good!!   Friendly service and great attitude keep me coming to this place. Today I went back and brought my sister and a friend for a cup of their yummy coffee. The guy working today was really nice and very upbeat... it kind of gave me a sense of the Oregonian attitude - friendly and cheerful.   Plus they gave out free stickers!! I'm so putting one on my car.

This is probably the best place to shop!! i love this little boutique. it's clothes are ones that turn head and say "fashionista" haha, but seriously it's an amazing store to shop in or to just browse around. if you love your seven jean, true religions, or diesel you wont find it in this store. this place carries the best selection of jeans around, from Ksubi, April 77, to Habitual.   The shoe selection is awesome!! you can't find the kind of shoes they have anywhere in the valley, from Alexander McQueen Pumas, Nike, Swear.   they also have little parties, so if you sign up for their new letter they post when they have gatherings.

A new Asian community. I think this is Lee-Lee's competition... pretty much yeah. The plaza setup is really neat. It's like a mini-mall.   The aisles do seem a little small especially when there are other people, but it's way neat to explore. I like the little stores outside of the main grocery stores... I always check out the Asian mobile store. I'm a big fan of NOKIAs so I ways need to check out what kind of selection their store has. I was not disappointed!   Check this place out, it's pretty neat. Never been to any place like it.

I'm probably over doing it, but I've been here 3-days in a row. I'm getting my Mexican fix before heading back to Detroit. It's been a few years since I've been here. I'm never disappointed after eating at this place, the people are friendly, and the juice drinks are sooo good! I can't eat anything like this in the D, not even in Southwest Detroit - Mexicantown.   They have a hotdog stand outside their door for those late night cravings. The guy who mans it is friendly and is there everyday except for Monday nights.   Maybe I'll make tonight my 4th visit and eat some grub! Yummm!!!

I love this restaurant!  I've to the Tempe, Chandler, Scottsdale, and Phoenix ones. This location is pretty unknown. The food is still GREAT. The ambiance was a little unwelcoming. The bathroom is super cold, like they want you to go in-and-out  ASAP. The people that work there seem like it's their first job at a restaurant . The employees are friendly but not as outgoing as the other locations.   The food was great and the service wasn't bad either. Very quick and knowledgeable.  I'd go to this one again since it's the only one located in the EAST valley.

Even though I live right down the street from this place (3 miles) I doubt I'll come back here again.   I came here since it's the most convenient electronic store in town. I know they have a Price Match program, since I'm looking for a new digital camera i looked online for an ad that would beat what Best Buy is selling for. The camera I was looking at was a Canon SD880 IS Best Buy was selling it for $300 and I found an ad for $249 not bad, so I printed it out and took it in.  I went to the camera station located in the middle of the store and a young girl ask "are you finding everything ok sir?" I pulled out the ad and said "yeah hi, do you guys honor this ad?" she looked at the ad with a puzzled expression and said "let me check with customer service."  We walked to customer service and she proceeded on asking one of her co-workers named James.   James: "We can't honor this ad." Me: "Why? from my understanding you guys honor domestic ads." James: "We can only honor an ad that is in it's region. It has to be an ad where you can drive to like a Radioshack or Target." Me: "WHAT?! that doesn't make any sense. Best Buy is all over this country. The ad I am presenting to you is located in Cambridge MA. I have a friend that lives in Boston, so basically I would need to send this ad to my friend, he then has to go to his local Best Buy and they would honor that?" James: "Basically... I mean we can't honor it because it's not driving distance."   I was FRUSTRATED!! i just said "ok" and left.   I went to another Best Buy and they basically gave me the ad deal. Inconsistency with their product knowledge. ugh! it's aggravating.   THE MAN NEEDS HIS ELECTRONIC GADGETS dammit!

If you're ever in the West Valley, say Goodyear area, I would truly recommend Brother's Pizza Express. It's a great mom and pop place you can't really get in Phoenix. The owners came from NYC - those New Yorkers just know how to make great pizza! :)  I think I'm going to make it a tradition to stop by this place on my way to or from California since I'm hardly ever on the West Valley.   Their prices are cheap and you get your money's worth when you go. The people are very friendly and are very personable with their customers. I think if you live in the area and go their a lot it wouldn't be a bad idea to make this place your regular place for pizza.   Great pizza and customer service! Hope to stop by soon!

This a great find, especially for Chandler!!! I prefer this place more than Rush Coffee. The lay of this place is open and LOTS of comfy couches to relax and mingle with your friends.  This has a very modern feel and look that is very inviting. Not only is the design of the place good, but the company is partnered with organizations that have a cause to fight: Blood: Water Mission, Kiva, Boys & Girls Club, World Vision, The Water Project, and so much more. They welcome donations to help fight causes throughout the community.   This is going to be my new place to come!! Although, they have limited hours - which could deter some new clients... maybe if they get enough traffic through the door, they'd think about changing their time schedules.

Great place! I love how local-oriented they are with their burgers. It's nice seeing businesses moving towards sustainable supplies. The beer is quite lovely. There's so many choices on the menu and to make things lively, they have performers on some evenings.   When I came here the second time, I had a server who was lacking on service. I had to order beer a few times in order for her to deliver; that also happened with our food. Asking for our order a few times is excessive. But we gave her her 20% tip along with a nice note stating she should be more attentive with her table. It's not that big of a deal, but this was also a lesson on her part just in case she gets a really nasty customer in the future.   Anyway, back to the beer! I loved the Table Tap Saison and Bear Wallow Berliner Weisse! Full of body and flavor! Coming back for more soon... as soon as I can leave this tundra of a state (Michigan) :)

If you don't mind getting down and dirty with your claws, this place is heaven on earth (I seem to be having this trend of "heaven" for some reason). The couple of times I've gone in, I ordered the 1-lb shrimp with trifecta, medium, with white rice and garlic vinegar on the side. I was in a trance until I came up for air. GOD it was so good! They give you a plastic bib so you can eat like a child and splash your family with the juices from shrimp - I'm salivating as I write this - you can even write on the walls if your artistic personality dares to compete with all others who have attempted to be the next Van Gogh.   **NOTE: I have a high toleration when it comes to spicy foods and I ordered MEDIUM, the constant delicious burn is refreshing. But for some, a ZERO or no spice should be something you could order and maybe ask for the spicy sauce on the side.  For those you are not keen on chomping with their hands, for example, my mother who had a manicure that etched GREEN BAY PACKERS prior to coming here, you can ask for GLOVES to cover your delicate spirit fingers.   They compost the scraps! I love that!   I WISH WE HAD ONE OF THESE IN DETROIT AREA! This will definitely be my first stop when I land at PHX!

I've waited for some good Mexican for 5-months, boy was it worth it! I missed tasty Mexican food and Arizona is one place to find it. My sister took me here; I wanted some place with that, hole-in-the-wall feel, nothing too fancy and affordable.   I ordered the Veggie Burrito enchilada style with Red Sauce. It was yummy! Also, I did mention to my sister, "it's a little salty," but I didn't mind it. We also ordered the guac and salsa chips. Guac was creamy and exquisite!   I would definitely come back here again!
