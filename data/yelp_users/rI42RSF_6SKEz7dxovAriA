I came for coffee and creamer...$75 later I came for shoes, shirts, pants, two pair of shoes AND coffee and creamer.. I'm a sucker for their sales!  I tend to find the best items when I take random trips at night here!

My mom points to this random restaurant as I'm driving and says "I've always wanted to take you there" I replied "really why" she said quickly "I took your brother and he really liked the baked MAC and cheese" as I'm pulling a U-turn I say "you can't take my brothers to something you're suppose to take me to first-momcode"  Of course I had to try the baked MAC and cheese but we also got the cheviche appetizer and two Shirley temples.   The baked MAC and cheese was delicious and had the perfect texture to it. It's rather greasy but that to me shows they're using top notch cheese! Coming from a gal with Wisconsin blood (thanks to my pops and dad) I can appreciate a good cheese!   The cheviche was perfect I had to try it as it had fresh avocado-which I'm a sucker for! The chips were cooked JUST right I even used them for my MAC and cheese.   Now the famous Shirley temple yes that drink you got when you were younger to "appear" as if you had a mixed drink. Well I'm well over drinking age but a Shirley temple. Sounded refreshing and delicious and the waitress caught my smile when she brought me an old school glass sprite bottle.   It was an enjoyable meal my mom appreciated that I wanted to try it and liked it. To her I say "I'll pay the tab as long as you keep this our mother DAUGHTER restaurant "

I like this place for their quick corn dogs. The one pet peeve is when they don't give me ketchup. It might just me but I believe it should just be standard for every bag to get 1 or 2 ketchup packets. Is that weird?  Aside from my lack of ketchup I love their cotton candy dipped cones an jalepenos poppers with ranch perfection!  Ps whoever served at the drive thru was a cutie! That is all

Have to say based off the reviews (that I read after already eating and leaving) my service was completely different. My waitress Mel-I believe was polite always made sure we had refills, she brought enough napkins without me even asking for more which is my biggest pet peeve when you don't bring enough napkins. The burger  I had was the smokehouse cheddar bacon aka *mouth watering* it was cooked just right and huge slices of bacon (in my eyes) I have no complaints. In addition to my burger we had; chilli cheese fries and a hot dog kids meal. I also didn't know about their children eat free special which as a parent I felt like I hit the jackpot! I gave it 4 stars only because we were the only ones in there to service had it been busy I wonder if the service and demeanor would've been different.

So they're pretty friendly at this location.. They just rush you I'm sorry I don't have the menu memorized and sometimes I like to try new mixes. I asked the girl closing my bowl if the bowls got smaller she laughed and said not really. Then everyone in the prep line said no ma'am our bowls are the same size (like they're coached to say this ) I could barely see the rice and they drizzled on the sour cream. It was at That moment I wouldn't dare ask to add my avocado in fear they'd charge me a dollar for a corner spoon. Ps the rice was hard

Stumbled in here with my daughter while waiting for dinner. The guy there was the most friendly person I've ever met he greeted us he met his dog who is 13 years old and friendly. He mad made me feel so at home I was already picking out accessories and I don't even have a dog but Just to support a small business and a friendly one at that I went  through the store thinking about what outfits I could get my friends who have furry children of their own.

I was visiting my family on the east side and needed to get a wax like yesterday! My aunt recommended a place walking distance from her house. I went and saw two places that offer waxing. I went into this location with my daughter. The stylists and their clients just stared at me no hello nothing *cricket cricket * I then looked over their prices and services $15 for an eyebrow wax was a bit much but I was willing to pay it as I was in a salon not just a nail spa. After this one of the stylist asked if I was there to meet someone ( as she's walking away) I responded " no, I'm looking to get a wax do you have the availability?" She looked at me and continued a conversation with her client and doing her hair..I stood there literally 3 minutes waiting for someone to get me and take me to the waxing room no one followed up-nothing. I went next door to get my wax services!!  Word of advice to this salon greet your customers and not look at them like they're lost if you want their money and time.

I got an eyebrow and gel nail done. I'm soo picky about where I go to get services since I have been to my fair share of un sanitized salons. The staff was friendly and they took their time to make my nails and eyebrows look better than on point! I wish I knew the names of the two but they have gained a happy customer! The 20% off coupon offered by yelp was the icing on the delishly pink and accent gel nail I got

The only reason I gave this location two stars is because I'm optimistic that they'll actually have my order correct this time. What prompts me to review while waiting in the drive thru for my order? The rude drive through runner that so politely kept asking me is that it after every thing I added( ordered two meals)   So I come back to this unfinished review to add ANOTHER unhappy review it never fails I always have an issue at this location. I ordered a strawberry & cream pie and guess what I get asked at THE SECOND window "would you like an apple pie instead?" I said no thank you.. And she offers cookies I say sure...she gives me one cookie..i thanked her and was about to drive o I asked how many cookies do I get? She says oh the other is baking five minutes later my ice cream is melted and I am obviously annoyed. Let me also add the three times in the drive thru they had my mothers order wrong.

I had the pad thai shrimp and chicken combo and mango curry with white rice (split between two people ) My mother had the laad.   First of all the pad thai no peanuts combo was amazing I've always gone to the thai orchard garden and have had thai basil but this place set a higher bar than both! the fresh lime was something I've never thought of.  The mango curry-medium spice was heaven on earth especially with the white rice! Lastly the Laad yes, I stole a few bites from moms plate. I'm a HUGE texture eater so I was pretty hesitant. the flavor was spicy and flavorful..you will not loose any flavor from the spice. Portion was more than generous and if you run out of lettuce and cucumbers try it with rice!   Ok I guess I'm not done. To top off this hidden treasure I tried the mango sticky rice dessert all I can say is OMG!! 50 cents quote "I love you like a fat kid loves cake" is no more insert now " I love you like a fat kid loves mango sticky rice!"
