Such a beautiful garden!    Offers a free day the second Tuesday of the month. I'm already looking forward to going next month when it's a bit cooler.   The have a neat activity for kids- ask at the front gate.   The gift shop carries beautiful pottery and art.  Great place to find interesting gifts or souvenirs.   The grounds are impeccable!

Barros is my favorite pizza joint. You can't find a better pizza anywhere. Years ago when we moved out of state, we bemoaned that we could no longer eat at Barros. When we moved back to Arizona, it was one of the first restaurants that we visited.   I haven't eaten a Barros pizza that I don't like!  Ham and pineapple is one of our favs. The crust is always chewy, crunchy and perfect.   Employees at this location were friendly and efficient.   The pizza is always the best when eaten in the restaurant!    We will return many more times!

We've been going to Valle Luna on and off for years.    The last time that we ate there, we were less than pleased.  The food was bland, the sauces all tasted the same.  I ordered tamales, my favorite, they were as hard as rocks, so dense and heavy and unpleasant.  The rice was blah.  My daughter decided that rather than order from the kids meal, she would order a 1/2 price happy hour appetizer.  The happy hour menu was standing up in the middle of the table for all to see.  When we tried to order off the appetizer menu, we were told that those items could only be ordered in the bar and that the server was unable to accomodate us.  I decided to go into the bar and order the appetizer to bring back to our table.  On the upside, the bartender was very helpful and said that it was fine, nothing worng with bringing it back to our table and then offered to bring it to us when it was done!  So helpful!   We were very  disappointed that the server was so unwilling to help us solve the problem.    We went home with tons of leftovers because none of us thought the food was any good.  Don't know why we took it home, it just ended up in the trash.   I guess we'll continue our quest to find the best Mexican food restaurant!

This Albertson's is such an improvement on the other store that is located on Rural and Guadalupe.    Big, open store with wide aisles.  Clean and stocked well.  Went in today for several sale items and was pleased to see that they had the items in stock.  Friendly employee who rang my order.

We went to Lowes to purchase a new gas range.    The employee who helped up was distracted, unable to answer our questions, did not seem to be experienced or knowledgeable in the sale of large appliances.  I had little to no confidence in what he said - he appeared to be completely clueless in regards to brands, quality of merchandise or options.  Despite the advertised free delivery and install offer that is going on right now, he said that it would cost us $149 to have a gas range installed not including the gas hose that we would need to purchase at $30.  Yeah, see ya later!    Best Buy is the place to go!  They match prices, offered us FREE install on the same gas range and were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.    Don't waste your time with Lowes, head straight to Best Buy!

I like build a bear. My daughter loves build a bear. Yes, it's pricey. Yes, the quick process detracts from the experience. But my daughter thinks it's fantastically amazing to chose an animal, see it go from a shell to a new lovey, then choose a name, groom, etc.   Might not be MY idea of a great time but the kids love it.   Employees are always friendly and engaging with the kids. Patient too!    I love buying gift certificates here for Christmas gifts and birthdays.

After going several years without a Sam's Club membership, I recently snatched up a deal on groupon for a membership.    I didn't renew my membership when it lapsed because we figured that membership to Costco was plenty and that we wouldn't use both.  After getting the membership, I remembered why I liked Sam's in the past.  They carry completely different items than Costco.  There are several items that I really love that Costco doesn't carry.  One of the great things about Sam's is that you can add a non-family member onto your membership and split the cost of membership!  Does anyone know if Costco does this?    We've always been helped by friendly employees.

The idea of buying bread for a discounted price is very appealing. However, the day old bread is extremely unappealing. I cannot imagine that this bread was baked the day before, it was so dry.  No one in my house would even eat it.  Too bad for us, the ducks were the lucky ones.   I much prefer the Oroweat outlet on Kyrene and Warner where I always get fresher bread.

I vow to never step foot into this mcdonald's again.  It is by far, the nastiest McDonald's I have ever visited.    We went in today for an after school mcflurry.  The place smelled bad (think vomit) and it was dirty.  The upholstered chairs are in such bad shape that they have been "repaired" with duct tape all along the entire bank of tables.    This place gives me the creeps.  So long McDonald's.  I don't think I'll miss you.

Two stars seem kind of low, but the description of "Meh.  I've experienced better" is suitable.  Three stars is "A-OK," not how I would describe this place.  I love to support local business - would much rather give my money to a local business owner than some big chain conglomerate.  Sorry Gold Bar, but you'll have to do better if you want to earn business from me.  I won't support local business if they aren't up to standards.    This was the first time that I have visited this place.  I waited a very long time to place my order with just one person ahead of me.  It seemed to take the coffee person 10 minutes to make one coffee drink.  I ordered some kind of iced tea.  They used the same tea bags that I use at home, nothing special, it wasn't a loose leaf specialty, which is what I would expect from the prices they charge.  I also have to question how old that tea was - it certainly tasted like it was old.......  I waited for a very long time to get my tea.  I finally went up to the counter to ask and they said, "Oh, we put orders over on the other side."  I would have thought that they would have called out my order when it was ready rather than just leaving it sit there on the counter.  That's what most places do!    This place was crowded on the day that I was there, which surprised me.  Lots of people with computers doing work and a few study groups with toddlers running around.  It seemed cramped and small with all of the people stuffed in there.  Wondering why so many people go there......  The other thing that I really disliked was that I had to go into the back of the place to use the restroom.  Dark, dingy and dirty were the words that came to mind.  Yuck - if the bathrooms and back of house aren't clean, it makes me wonder about the rest of the place........

I don't remember shopping at this location prior to the remodel.  I can see myself shopping here much more often in the future.  I'm already thinking about how much it sucks to shop in the summer when it's 110 - but covered parking?!?  oh, yeah, I'll be there in the summer.  Nice and clean, easy to shop, wide aisles, no clutter in the end caps.  SO easy to shop this store.  Went in today for an advertised price on chicken that we were planning on having tonight.  Asked the meat guy if there was any more chicken left.  Was told that they were sold out.  I told him that the reason we came to his store was because of the price and we were planning on eating the chicken tonight with dinner guests.  I asked if he could sub something, and he said, "SURE, no problem!"  Friendly, helpful, super easy.  I also mentioned that the last time we came in, I bought something with a manager special sticker on it but was charged the regular price.  The customer service guy refunded my money with no questions!  Awesome.  Great store, nice selection of bulk items, fresh produce, large service deli, in house bakery with some incredible looking treats, clean.....  I'll definitely be shopping at Bashas!  As if I could rave anymore, it's a LOCALLY owned business!

Every time I shop at the store I like it more!!!    It is the cleanest grocery store in my area, the employees are friendly and helpful, the sale prices are great, the quality of the meat department, produce and bakery are fantastic.   If you haven't shopped at Bashas  you've got to go check it out!

What a GREAT museum.    We went today for Free First Sunday.  (Every month there are three museums in Mesa that offer free admission on the first Sunday of the month - sponsored by Target).  It was pretty crowded but we managed with no problem.  The exhibit halls are very well done.  There's a little something for everyone - dinosaurs, space, mesoamerica, Arizona in the movies, panning for gold, replica pueblos, walk through jail, archaeology finds, etc.    I was impressed with the staff as well.  They were friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and plentiful.    We really enjoyed our visit.  Great place for the entire family - everyone is bound to find something they enjoy.  My 10 yo daughter and 12 yo son enjoyed it equally and are already looking forward to returning!

I love supporting local, independent stores in Tempe.  However, I will never shop at, support, or recommend this store again.  I am a new customer and new to brewing.  I went to this store and bought supplies that I needed to start my first few small batches of home brew and later decided that I didn't need 2 of the 1 gallon glass jugs that I purchased.  I went to return them today and was told that "all sales are final."  The worker even called the owner, Jeffrey, to find out if the bottles could be returned.  The bottles still had the original store price tag and sticker and had obviously not been used.  The store also had the record of my transaction in the computer.  The owner refused to allow the worker to return the product which could have been placed right back onto the shelves without any problem.  I would have understood the policy if it had been yeast or some other perishable product.  This is a terrible policy for any store.  This place just lost ALL of my future business over a $12 return.  I'm glad that I can find all of the supplies I need for future brewing on Amazon.  Oh and guess what, Amazon is cheaper AND backs ALL of their products!  I refuse to support a business that doesn't have reasonable customer service policies.  Oh, and since I commented on Brewers's Connection Facebook page, they have disabled the ability for any comments to be made on their page. My comment was removed as well.   The best part about this whole experience is that I found another local brew shop in Gilbert called Brew Your Own Brew. It looks like they even have cheese making supplies. I can't wait to go check out this shop!  Hopefully the owner isn't a jackass.

I was so pleased with the service that we received on a recent visit to Chili's.    We often go get an afternoon snack of appetizers when we're out and about.  Hands down, one of our new favorite places to go is Chili's for their bottomless chips and salsa.  Order a couple of drinks and we're set for an afternoon snack.  Server was so friendly!  Honestly, it's been a while since we've had such great customer service!  He was all smiles while he brought us basket after basket of chips.  We actually joked about feeling bad that it was so cheap and that we ate so many chips.  His response, "I'll bring you as many baskets of chips as you want!  That's what I'm here for!"    Oh, and the chips and salsa are so good!  Totally unexpected for a large chain restaurant.  Fresh chips made in house and yummy salsa......it's actually kind of pathetic that we thought that the salsa was better than what is served in MANY of the Mexian food restaurants around town.  Salsa should never be an afterthougt.....  Thanks for surprising us Chili's!

We decided to give Rosita's a second chance and I'm glad we did!    The chips and salsa are excellent here.   I ordered the Monday night special - chicken fajitas burro and it was delicious. Much better than anything I've ever ordered in the past. It came with rice and beans that were.....fine. The rice could use some help.  One person in our party ordered the green corn tamales - she did not care for them. My husband said the fajitas beef burro was good. My daughter inhaled her kid's grande plate that was fill of mini tacos, tostada, rolled tacos, etc.  My son ordered the beef chimi. He said it was good, but soggy.   I definitely agree with other reviewers - this place needs a major face lift and deep cleaning. The restrooms are a disaster.   Very casual atmosphere. The service was fine, but not great.  Nothing to compliment but nothing do big as to complain.

We have tried many middle eastern restaurants over the years.  I was introduced to Haji Baba during my college years - almost 20 years ago.    Hands down, it is the BEST middle eastern food around and the prices can't be beat.  We moved to Utah about 10 years ago and searched for food that was as tasty as it is here.  At the end of the meal, we would say, "well, it was okay, but it's no Haji Baba."  When we decided to move back to Arizona, the first place we went for lunch out was Haji Baba!  It continues to be delicious.  I also love the market that is inside.  I buy all of my feta here as well as greek olives.  They have awesome prices on the feta and olives as well as spices that can be hard to find elsewhere.    There are several things worthy of complaining about, but the food is so good that it makes it all worth it.  This place is very popular, which makes it difficult to find a table during peak times.  Lunch is crazy busy!  The service in the restaurant leaves something to be desired.  It's pretty bare bones and definitely not at all like the nice chain greek restaurants (think My Big Fat Greek....)  We no longer eat in the restaurant, we now go for take out.  This place does a huge amount of take out so call your order in ahead of time.  Great food, good portion sizes, great prices.  I don't know why we keep trying different middle eastern food restaurants, it's Haji Baba's gyros that we always wish we had eaten instead!  Nothing is better!

Meh, with the abundance of much better Mexican food available we won't be coming back for food.   Food was totally plain Jane and overly greasy.  Our server wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu and forgot about us midway through the meal. We had to flag down a different server to ask for to go containers for the second time and the check.   Not impressed.

I ordered the chicken Pad Thai.  It was good but it fell flat in flavor. I should have requested lime wedges, cilantro, green onion and raw bean sprouts to brighten the whole dish.  I don't know why I didn't think of that as I was eating!  I also ordered it medium spicy which I thought was actually really tame. I wish that I had gotten it spicier.   Service was great.   The lunch prices and the quantity of food you received for lunch is an awesome deal. I'm pretty sure that Pad Thai was $7.95.   By the time we left at 12:30 the place was packed.   I'm sure I will be back!

I have been extremely happy with every cut that I've received at this Fantastic Sam's.   The salon is always clean, stations are clean, stylists are friendly and have always been receptive to my questions and helpful with choosing a style.  The stylists that I use are experienced and have solid training.   I started having my hair cut by Roya several years ago. Went in once when Roya wasn't there and was seen by Debbie Bell.  I've been going back to Debbie ever since. She's great, always talks about a style first, gives great scalp massages during shampoo and I always leave with a fantastic cut.   Today I brought my daughter in to have her hair cut. She donated 10 inches to locks of love a few months ago at Dolce Salon. The stylist at Dolce butchered her hair. When I was talking to Joseph, the stylist at Fantastic Sam's, I told him how unhappy I was with the Dolce cut. He evaluated her hair thoroughly and said that there were a lot of technical issues with her cut and found 1 inch cut errors throughout her hair.    Joseph did a great job with my 11 year old daughter. Not only did my daughter receive a great cut, Joseph was friendly and personable to an 11 year old. Nice guy, experienced stylist.   I have since learned that Dolce hires apprentice stylist.  I will never return to Dolce for a cut.  Don't let the price and atmosphere of Fantastic Sam's fool you, they are great at what they do. I used to pay so much for a haircut......  Affordable, friendly, walk in service.

Is there really anything that can be complained about when it comes to TJ's?!?   Favorite place to shop, hands down.  As if the items they carried weren't enough to keep me coming back, the staff is the topping on the cake!  Always friendly, helpful and willing to do what it takes to make customers happy.    I love you TJ's!

I ran to Ace today to pick up a paintbrush to paint an interior room. Haven't been here in quite a while. I usually head to lowes or Home Depot for stuff like this. I was pinched for time so I headed to Ace.   I was greeted by a friendly employee. When I headed to the paint area, I was immediately frustrated that the area was so cluttered I couldn't even get to the brushes. I looked around and noticed that much of the store was cluttered with crap all over the aisles, was unshoppable , and merchandised VERY poorly.   Ace lost my business today. I walked right out if their store and headed next door to Sherwin Williams.  The brushes were much nicer in quality and the store was nicely organized.   Too bad, I would love to support locally operated Ace.  Hope they get their shit together.

I was pleasantly surprised by the care my cat received when we went in for an exam this mroning due to what appeared to be an infected eye.    I called the office last night because my cat's eye looked terrible.  It was wet and pussy, swollen shut and she was miserable - not eating and not drinking.  The receptionist was so pleasant and encouraging, told me that we could come in first appointment of the morning - on a Saturday!    We arrived and immediately were brought back to an exam room.  The tech came in, asked a lot of questions, was very thorough with the health history, answered some questions.  Dr. Dobbertien came in shortly after to examine our cat.  He spent nearly 30 minutes with us!  I have never had a vet be so willing to spend time with us and be so willing to answer questions and talk about treatment and future issues our cat may encounter.  I wish my own doctor was so approachable!  Seriously can't say enough about how much I appreciated this!  When we left I told my husband that I usually feel as though I'm inconvienencing a dr with questions, like they are tired of me, wanting to go on to the next patient.  Not so with Dr. Dobbertien.  He anwered all of our questions, and offered loads of info.    I would recommend this office to all of my friends and family.  They charged $45 for the office visit - very affordable in my book!  The only thing that I can see some people complaining about is that the office is a bit older than some.  It isn't as modern and doesn't look to have all of the bells and whistles of other offices....doesn't bother me one bit and I'm sure my cat didn't notice.  :)  Perhaps this is one reason their prices appear to be lower than some clinics.    BTW, did you know that you can use Walmarts $4 prescriptions for your animals?  I brought the list of $4 medications to the office with me.  Dr. Dobbertien chose an antibiotic off the list which he said would do the trick to clear up my cat's eye infection.

This was our first time going to Someburros.  I've heard lots of people talk about it, but until recently had never eaten any of their food.  We recently went to a party where we learned that the party throwers had ordered all of the food from Someburros.  We were loved the hot sauce and decided that we had to go in and get some for ourselves.  We went on Sunday afternoon and only ordered chips and hot sauce to go.  The chips were stale - had to toss them in the oven when we got home.  The hot sauce IS tasty.    The service is horrible at this place!  The server was annoyed by our questions, was unfriendly and seemed unhappy to be working.  We felt like we were bothering her rather than her being willing to offer up good customer service.    Despite the close proximity to our home, we won't be going back to this restaurant.   Rather, we'll be going to Chili's for their bottomless chips and salsa when we want a quick chips and salsa snack fix!

Oh Filibertos you were such a disappointment tonight!  We had such a simple order - 2 bean burritos and an order of rolled tacos.  Order after order came up to the window and there we stood waiting and waiting and waiting some more.  It took 22 minutes for our order to come out.  That was after the employee repeatedly asking us what our order was and checking to see if it was coming up.  He finally realized that our order slip was not even on the round about and had to put the order in again.  When we complained that it took 22 minutes for our food, we got a blank stare and a "um, sorry."    Crappy customer service.  Decent food.  I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.

I visited for the first time today.   My husband and I were the only two people in the store. When we walked in, the bells chimed and the woman at the counter didn't even look our way. She never looked up from her paper on the cash wrap. After being in the store for at least 10 minutes, another associate walked right past us, a foot away and didn't even acknowledge us. She went up to the register and immediately began talking to the other lady. She then leaned down on the cash wrap the rest of the time that we were there.   We were in the store for at least 15 minutes without receiving a hello or even a smile. No offer of assistance, nothing. Worst customer service ever. I can't remember the last time that I was completely ignored while in a completely empty store with two employees standing around talking.   The prices are ridiculous. I do buy nice spices at other shops but this is the most expensive spice shop I've visited in a long time.   The store is nicely laid out and merchandised well.   By principle alone, I refuse to spend my money in a store that doesn't even acknowledge my existence.  It was like we were invisible.

There are so many reviews of Changing Hands, I could not possibly add anything more to say.  One of my favorite places to spend an hour in Tempe.  You can find me sprawled out on the floor in front of the cookbook section.....if you see me, ignore the fact that I'm drooling over the pictures of food and just pass me a tissue......

Spent the day at Acacia Day use area midweek in June.  There was hardly anyone there!  We were able to spread out and enjoy Canyon Lake.  There was plenty of shade, it is maintained well, clean, restroom facilities nearby.  We had a GREAT time!  Don't forget to pick up your Tonto Pass ($6) before heading up the skinny two lane road!  I suggest the Circle K in town.    Don't forget to bring plenty of water!

I was shopping nearby so I thought I'd go check this place out.   As many reviewers have said, this grocery has a chaat kitchen in the back. It isn't a restaurant. I find that people either hate this kind of place or love it. I didn't expect much in terms of the space, but some people do.  I found it to be ran enough, the tables were wiped, but they did have staining. Again, not a big deal to me.   I wish that the menu did a better job explaining the food. I really had no idea what I was ordering.  I ordered the pani puri and the bada paav. I liked the filling for the pani puri and I also liked the patty inside of the bada paav. I could totally have skipped the soggy and tasteless hamburger bun.  Both were flavorful and I enjoyed the spices. I have no idea what "authentic" indian food tastes like do I have nothing to compare. I did think it was tasty. I'd like to try the curry!  Communication was a little difficult. I think that may be one of the reasons why other reviewers say that the owner is rude.  He wasn't rude to me, but he wasn't warm either.   I'll definitely Boy Scouts back to try more items on the menu!

Walking around Scottsdale during lunch time.  Decided to stop in here rather than walk a few more blocks to Los Dos.  In hindsight, we should have walked!  Party of 6, 4 adults, 2 kids.  I ordered the tortilla soup - $6 for a bowl.  It was good, lots of chicken and was tasty.  When I asked for chips to put into my soup, I was told that we woud be charged for more chips because we had already received 2 chip portions and they charged $2 for more chips after that.  This did not please me.  We had 6 people at the table and the chip "baskets" that they use could not possibly have more than 1 cup of chips per basket.  I have NEVER been told that there was a charge for chips in a mexican food restaurant.  I will note though, that this place does not really qualify as mexican - think Tex Mex.    I thought that the serving sizes were pretty measily for the prices they charge.  One person at our table ordered two tacos with beans and rice ($10).  The tacos were very small and were served with about 4 Tablespoons each of beans and rice.  BUT, if you like lettuce, you'd be in for a treat!  Half the plate space was taken up with shredded lettuce to fill the space that should have had FOOD on it!  My kids split the chicken tenders and fries plate (also $10).  They received 4 tenders and a handful of waffle fries.  I don't know that we've ever paid $10 for something that would normally be on a kids menu at any other place for about $6.  It looked like our server was serving the entire restaurant.  We motioned to two girls who were standing near the chips talking.  They both came over and asked if we needed something.  We said we were ready to order and they said that they would find our server because they were "training."  They only thing we saw them do was stand and talk over at the chip counter.      Considering how many great places there are to eat in the area, I would not chose to eat here again.  Can't really find anything that makes this place stand out from any other ho-hum place.  The price of the food and what actually was on the plate did not seem to correlate to each other.  No thanks

I love this shop and the friendly employees.   We don't usually buy a lot, but we usually stop in for a few pieces of candy when we're shopping at the mall.   I've never eaten a piece of See's candy that I didn't like.   Perfect gift!

I am very surprised to see such high ratings for this place.  The ONLY thing going for Dos Gringos is the atmosphere.  It looks like it would be a fun place to hang out and have a cocktail with friends.  That is, if you can actually carry on a conversation without going hoarse because you have to yell to be heard over the blaring music.   This was our first visit to Dos Gringos.  My husband and I went out without the kids during this visit.  I saw that they had a kids menu but didn't look at prices or choices.  The food was extremely disappointing.  the chips were obviously dumped out of a bag somewhere in the back and the salsa was....bland.    I ordered a pick two combo which came with mini (very mini, three bite tacos - could have been one bite for my husband) , flautas and rice and beans.  I swear that there could not have been more than 1 Tbsp of meat in each taco and flauta.  I don't think that the flautas actually had meat in them.  I take that back, a disgusting charred bit of steak fell out of it on my last bite.  My husband ordered 2 street tacos with rice and beans.  He ended up with substantially more food at a cheaper price than mine.  His tacos looked decent, but the meat I tasted was unimpressive.   We don't plan on going back to Dos Gringos anytime in the near future.  Even the chain restaurants have them beat and that's not saying much!    My rating: Blech

However, the last time that I was in I was treated very rudely and tsk'ed for doing something outside of the store that was none of the employee's business. Yes, he literally said "tsk tsk."  I was so upset that I came home and told my husband who immediately called the store manager to discuss the employee's interaction with me.   I hope that this was an isolated incident because I've never had a single issue in this well maintained store.

Love this Costco!    Friendly employees, well stocked, clean, organized.   The only negative comment is that during the week there are frequently very long, slow moving lines because only 2 lanes are open. The need to have a faster check out during the week. The weekends are araffed better and I don't wait nearly as long.   Bought a Vitamix today!  So excited!

They're even helpful over the phone!  I just called to get information about refilling my inkjet printer cartridge. The guy in photo was knowledgeable and helpful. Thanks Costco!

I cannot believe that this store has any business.  EVERY single time that I visit this store, I vow to never, ever shop there again.  Somehow I keep forgetting and think that I'll just run in for something really quick.    When I first moved back to Az, I thought that I would shop at this store because it is a stone's throw away from my house.  Every week I would complain about the meat case.  The dripping chicken packages that made the case lines goopy was enough to make me want to throw up.  It smelled bad and always had disgusting gloppy crap in the caseline and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months.  I complained and complained and finally wrote to corporate.  I don't know why I kept going!  Anyway, they finally addressed the problem in the meat case and got it cleaned up, but that didn't last long.  I just went back the other day to check it out because chicken was on sale.  I was so replused by the caseline that I left the store without purchasing anything.  The egg case is gross and dirty as well.  And last week I could smell the seafood counter from 3 aisles away - something was not right with that!  I again make the vow that I will never, ever shop for groceries at this Albertson's again.  One word - disgusting.  Actually I can think of a lot more words like dirty, dingy, smelly, gross, the list could go on and on.  Yuck.  I can't believe that I'm about to say this, but.....I would rather shop at WAL-MART than shop at this store.  That's saying something!  **************On the complete opposite spectrum of terrible is the wonderful pharmacist at this location.  She is knowledgeable, friendly, patient, and explains doseages and side effects.  Last time I went in with my daugher who was getting anibiotics, the pharmacist explained the medication to my daughter, told her how much and how often and gave her some tips about getting rid of the nasty taste of this particular antibiotics.  The pharmacist at this store is the ONLY reason that I will ever step foot in this store again.

I cannot believe I let a sale on milk lure me into this dirty store again.  To prove that I'm not exaggerating the filth of this store, I took photos. Do you really want to eat anything that comes out of a case that is so incredibly gross?  I have no words to describe how grossed out I am after looking at the meat department. I looked because I was curious to know if they had solved the problems at the store.  I'm so repulsed, I wish that I didn't look!    I stand by my previous comment......I would rather shop at Walmart than at Albertsons. Big fat fail!

Went for lunch today.   I ordered the Asian chopped chicken salad. First time ordering a salad at Pei Wei.  I was impressed by the size of the salad as well as the nice amount of chicken in it. The greens were fresh and crisp. I loved the crispy wontons on top!  The only thing that I didn't like was the saltiness of the dressing and the fact that the salad was literally swimming in a pool of dressing in the bottom of the bowl.   Next time I order, I'll be sure to ask for less dressing or see if I can dress it myself.   Clean restaurant. Friendly and efficient ordering process.   Second time I've been there in less than a week.  Nom nom!

I don't usually shop at CVS because I find that the prices are higher than most drugstore retailers.   I dropped in recently because they had a special sale. I was very pleased with the store's customer service. The employees are helpful and friendly.  Several employees offered help and asked me if there was anything they could help me find while I was shopping.   The store was clean, well organized and very shopable.   I did not visit the pharmacy, this review is based only on my store experience.   I will be returning to shop here in the future.

I love shopping here.    Terrific prices, friendly and helpful employees, wide selection, clean and tidy.  Some of my favorite things at Sprouts - BULK items!  Need I say more?!?   They even have bulk spices and coffee!  I've never had a disappointing visit to this store.   Today I asked if they carried TVP - I used to be able to find this on the top of the bulk aisles in clam shells.  I asked an employee who contacted the bulk manager.  Bulk manager, Sergio went into the back and packaged up some TVP that was in the back.  So great.  I also received excellent and friendly customer service by Brianne up in front.  We looks to enjoy her job and is great interacting with the customer.  She even helped the elderly gentleman who was ahead of me in line when he had trouble with his credit card payment.    Thanks Sprouts!  I'm a loyal fan!

I don't think that I could possibly add anything more to the reviews that have already been posted about Bass Pro Shops.  This is our go to store for camping, fishing, hiking prep.  Great prices, great selection.  They have loads of free family "classes,"  and in store special activities.  The kids love to stop in to watch the fish in the big tank being fed or to feed the trout in the river.  Their favorite thing to do is sit at the bar in the restaurant, order fresh fried potato chips and watch the salt water fish in the huge restaurant tank.  Good place to explore on a hot Arizona summer day!

We love this cheap theater!    We've always received great customer service and the place is kept really clean.  When we left the theater today, there was a brigade of workers armed with brooms ready to clean it for the next showing.    The only time that we've ever had trouble has been when people watching the movie refuse to stop carrying on a conversation.  After kindly asking the two people to stop talking, she replied, "the movie only cost $2, give me a break."  They continued to have a full conversation for much of the movie.  I've never seen/heard anything like that before!  :)    The only other thing that might peeve people is that there are occasionally very small issues with projection - a line running through frames, etc.  It has always worked itself out and doesn't bother us.  We're regulars for $2 Tuesdays during the summer.  The theater also has a summer movie package available.  I recently saw that they upgraded several theaters to digital.  BRING CASH!  They don't accept credit cards!

We went to see Croods today in one of the new digital theater rooms.  WOW!  I couldn't believe the huge improvement.    I've never complained about picture quality at this theater - I figure that the low cost of the movie doesn't justify a complaint.  This new system rocks!  Such a great picture and the sound was really good too!    Great addition to your theater Pollack!  Thanks so much!   OH, and they now take CREDIT CARDS!

We love this library!  It is a smaller branch of the Chandler Public a Library System. This equates to a smaller selection of books. We usually do a lot of book requests from the larger downtown library.   They have some good programming throughout the week - check out the online calendar for current offerings.   My favorite feature is the new 3M library app that the library just announced.  The hope is that patrons will have a better experience with the library's digital collection.  They no longer participate in the Greater Phoenux Digital Library from Overdrive. It looks like the 3M app has a really great selection of current and popular books.   Be sure to look at the for sale books on the wall when you first walk in!  I've found done great deals on sought after books!

Up until today, I hadn't been here in years.    Went today at 10:00 am and was quite surprised at how busy the restaurant was.  I was even more surprised at the prices.  There wasn't much on the menu for under $10 - for breakfast.  Even the "lighter" options were heavy in price.    I was meeting a group, decided to order coffee because I had already eaten.  I must admit that I was surprised at the price of a 'nothing special' cup of coffee - 2.95 for coffee at a breakfast joint is over priced IMO.  I would much rather have spent that money on a Starbucks - at least I would have gotten some enjoyment out of my coffee!  I've heard that the food is good, it had better be darn good for the prices that they charge.    If you're going out for coffee and a muffin, this is not the place to go.

What's not to love about the LEGO store inside the Chandler Mall?    The store is always clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  I appreciate the way they interact with my preteen kids - recognizing that the kids are the customer and focusing on them rather than on me.  It's obvious that they value the young customers.  Never been disappointed!

We always have a great time at this pool.  They have a high dive, water slides, zero entry pool, lap pool, snack shack.  Hours of fun for everyone.  I've always been impressed with the life guards at this pool.  They are VERY attentive and tuned in to what's going on at the pool.  I've never been nervous or hesitant to let me kids go from pool to pool - no need to be a helicopter mom!    They do have some rather specific rules about food and drinks so make sure that you check the website before you go.  One thing that stands out is that they limit the size of coolers that can be brought in.  We usually end up bringing a couple of small "6 pack" coolers or lunchbox size coolers.  Bring plenty of your own cold water.  It's very affordable!  They have a hard time keeping the bathrooms clean with all of the wet bodies.  Everyone enters through the bathrooms - kind of weird!  Sometimes they smell, they are always wet.

I was so pleased with Mesa Ped today.    My 9 year old daughter woke up fevering, complaining of ear and neck pain, etc.  I called Mesa Peds and they got us in right away, even as a new patient.    As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by a pleasant receptionist, given the standard forms and sat down.  I hadn't even finished filling the forms out before we were called back - not even 5 minutes.  Whoa, I think that's a first!  My only complaint would be that at this point, the nurse who checked my daughters vitals was very standoffish, and didn't comfort my daughter in the least as she was crying.  I told the nurse that she was nervous because she hasn't had to see a Dr in years and her only response was, "oh."  She didn't engage me or my daughter at all, in fact, she never even introduced herself or made eye contact.  Luckily our time with her was short!  We were brought into an examination room to wait for the Dr.  Again, not more than 2-3 minute wait.    Dr. Haley was kind, gentle, thorough and engaging.  She explained everything that she was going to do and then again as she was doing it.  She talked to my daughter, explained what was going on and talked to me about treatment.    Overall, it was a good experience.  I'm telling you, I can't think of the last time that I was in and out of ANY medical office that fast!

After hearing so many rave reviews about JJ 's deliciously smooth smoothies, my family of 4 decided to try it out. This was our first experience at any JJ, first visit to this location.    We experienced extremely poor customer service. The girl who took our order was grumpy, didn't smile, say hello, or offer any information even though we told her that we had never been to JJ before. She took our order and our money without a thank you or any friendly interaction.   We were so disappointed with our smoothies. They were so chunky that we couldn't even use our straws. Chunks of fruit kept clogging up the straws. I'm not talking small chunks, I'm talking chew your way through hunks of mangos and bananas. I was under the impression that their smoothies were completely smooth. I was hoping that it would be a great way to get extra fruits and vegetables into my kids.  I can't imagine that our experience with chunky smoothies is normal. I have no idea what went wrong.   Overall we are pretty unsatisfied with our entire experience.

After sending 2 email customer service reports to Jamba Juice about our experience with no reply, I decided to call corporate. They were very helpful and agreed that chunky smoothies are not the norm. They were nice enough to send out coupons so that we could try it again. Thanks JJ!  I will update with round 2 experience when vouchers arrive.

Friendly staff who was helpful , pleasant and engaging. We asked them to make our smoothies extra smooth. They said, no problem !  They added time to the blend and they turned out great!  No chunks this time and do good!    Thanks for proving that the last experience was just a blip!

I recently opened up a bank account for our school PTSA with this branch.  Our PTSA was encountering a lot of problems with other banks and opening an account that would suit our needs for a business account.  We discovered the Az PTA works with Wells Fargo directly so our paperwork would be streamlined and easy to set up an account.  We were assigned someone to work with.  The Personal Banker's name was Sabrina Petit.  She was awesome.  Very professional and helpful throughout the entire process.  The first time that I went in, I neglected to make an appointment and was told that Bri had just gone on lunch.  The girl who I spoke with said, "why don't I call her and see if she can come back, she just left a few minutes ago."  She called and sure enough Bri said that she could come back!  Really?!?  Great!  She walked me through everything that we needed to do, got the account all set up for the co-signers who needed to complete info, and got our account up and going.  They offered our PTSA no fee checking, which included FREE checks!  Amazing!  If you've ever tried to open a business account anywhere else, you'd know that this is a big deal.  The bank was out of money bags the day that I set up the account.  Bri said that she would set one aside for me when they came in.  Sure enough, she called yesterday to tell me that the bags had arrived and that she set one aside for me.    Because of the nature of our account (business) and having mulitple signers, we have had to go into the bank several times to finalize signer paperwork.  Bri is always pleasant, patient, and helpful.  I would recommend that people ask for Bri - she was great.  So great in fact that we are thinking about going to open savings accounts for our kids there with her!    Oh and hey, you can't beat the popcorn machine, water bottles, cookies and sometimes lollipops that are in the lobby!  I wonder how many times my kids will ask to go to the bank to check the balance of their savings account in the hopes of getting some popcorn and a lollipop.......

I continue to have outstanding service at this bank.  In fact, it's been so great that both of my kids have opened up savings accounts at this branch and my husband and I are considering switching from the Credit Union.    Last time I was in the bank, I was horrified to hear how a customer was treating one of the bank employees.  What did surprise me was how calmly she handled herself.  I don't know that I could keep my cool as well as she did!  Sabrina no longer works here.  However, we have had wonderful service from Eric as well as the branch manager.    If you want to be taken care of, go to this branch!  They're great.

This was the letter that I wrote to Sea Life Aquarium about our recent experience:   I tried to leave a comment on the "sea life contact us" page, but kept getting a "page not found" error.  I called the 877 number and was told that you were the correct person to contact.  I am writing about a recent field trip that my children went on with ___________________________school.   We visited the Tempe Sea Life Aquarium on Sept 25, 2013.  I was lucky enough to be a chaperone for the day so I was able to experience your aquarium.  Initially I was a bit skeptical about visiting an aquarium in the desert!  I've been to many aquariums so I wasn't expecting a lot from your facility.  Boy, did you prove me wrong!  Your facility has beautiful and engaging exhibits with a large range of aquatic life.  Many children in the group had never been to an aquarium before so they had a wonderful first time experience.    Despite the beautiful tanks, we were disappointed in the educational presentation for which we payed extra money.  We were brought into a small, hot room where the kids played a game answering random questions about an oil spill and recycling.  Our students asked many questions at first and the answer that they received back most often was, "I'm not sure.  I just have the questions and answers written on the paper."  Our Honors Team students even laughed at the fact that the presenter was unable to spell "piranha."  The girl who did the presentation, I believe her name was Kristen, seems to need more training and education about the topics that she presented.    The first problem arose when she assumed that the kids were much younger than they actually were - not cool for 13 year old kids to be asked if they are 9.......not that big of a deal, but it set the presentation off on a negative note.  She was unable to interact with the kids in an engaging interactive manner which left the kids bored and uninterested.  The questions were random and there was no discussion about what the significance was regarding the questions and answers.  It was basically a bunch of random facts thrown at us that involved no thinking or discovery.  I feel that the presentation was not correctly geared towards our student's age group and academic level.  After the game, which lasted way too long (one hour), there was no discussion about the impact of oil spills or reasons why children should recycle or what they could do to make small changes to improve the health of our ecosystem.  Sadly, there was little to no educational value to the presentation.  I would have rather had my children watch a documentary on a screen than listen to someone present a topic in which they obviously had no training or understanding.  I feel that our time would have been better spent in the tank area.  Again, your facility is really nice and we enjoyed our time in the exhibit area.  However, your education department needs to step it up.

We've always had a great experience at this burger joint.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The burgers are some of the best around - I think that most of the people who are complaining about greasy burgers are mistaking the juiciness of the burger with grease.  These are juicy, drippy burgers....Yum!  We've never been disappointed.  The kids love this place.  The only downside that I will definitely agree on is that for a restaurant of this caliber, the prices are a bit higher than some places.  That being said, most restaurants are raising prices and will probably continue to do so.  MUCH better than The Habit, but the tradeoff is that SmashBurger is also more expensive.  I recently scored a deal on DealChicken which was $12 for $24 dollars worth of food.  Keep your eyes open for coupons and offers on Groupon and DealChicken!  Contrary to what most people said, we have NEVER waited in line and have always received immediate service.  We have only eaten in, never take out.  That being said, we've aways gone in the evening for dinner and not for lunch.

Went to zoyo last night for pj night - 1/2 price froyo.   I like the atmosphere of this place. Nice and casual and the outside seating is a huge plus. We like that we can choose how much froyo we want and there is a huge selection of toppings.   Be careful when dispensing and adding goodies!  The cups are ENORMOUS and you can end up with way too much if you're not careful.  I'm totally satisfied with 7 ounces - I see others who fill the entire cup. Our kids weigh their cups several times to make sure they stay on target.   I'm not convinced that I'm completely sold on this stuff. Seems overly sweet and leaves a funky after taste.  My kids like it and it's a super convenient location off us.  I keep thinking that I'll find a flavor that I really love.....  I laughed when I read a comment about what constitutes PJ's because I had a similar experience. I was denied the discount one night because I wasn't dressed to their PJ standard. They ended up giving the discount to me after all.  Before we left the house, I made my husband put sweats on!  :)  I swear it's about public humiliation!  Anyway, I think it depends on the person at the register.

We have grown to like this place more and more.    My daughter likes the veggie burgers - I'm almost positive they are Morning Star brand.   It's always clean, the employees are always friendly and the ingredients are always fresh.   We really like the patio.   Great ice cream too.

I was not overly impressed with 5 guys.  We have only been to this place one time.  The guy who took our order was impatient and unfriendly when we asked questions about the menu.    My burger was extremely wet which caused the entire thing to fall apart making it impossible to eat.  I also don't understand why they tell you that you can have anything that you want on your burger, but give such skimpy amounts.  ONE mushroom on a burger does not count as a topping.    I agree that the fry order is strange.  It's fine for two people to share, but I can't imagine going solo for lunch and ordering such a massive amount of fries.    I don't get the whole peanuts-in-a-burger-joint thing.......peanuts and burgers?  Prices are a bit on the higher side for such typical burgers.  Can't get out of there for under $10 person.  If the burgers were fantastic, I wouldn't mind the pricing, but they aren't that great.    Smashburger will continue to get my business over 5 Guys.

I went to Turn Style Consignment recently and was pleased with my experience.  The store is clean and is merchandised well - it isn't cluttered or over crowded.  Merchandise is hung according to size - huge bonus in my book when it comes to second hand shopping.  I was a bit surprised that some of the clothing did look very worn, but there was also a fair amount that had tags on and had obviously never been worn.  The kids area was slim pickings the day I went.  The staff was friendly and eager to answer any questions that I had about consignment.  I know that some people are wondering about the pricing.  In order to understand their pricing, you have to understand consignment in general.  Consignment works differently from most second hand stores.  Often the one consigning tells the store what the item is worth to them - or what they paid for it and then the item is priced.  If I'm remembering correctly, TurnStyle gives about 50% of the sale back to the consigner.  That's a great deal for consigners!    The store carries a wide variety of merchandise - clothing, household goods, decorative pieces, furniture, etc.   Check it out, you never know what you might find!

The people in the garden center have no knowledge about what they are selling. I asked numerous questions and received no information. Frustrating to say the least.   I'm tired of shopping for plants in Arizona and not being able to find native or drought tolerant plants. They mostly sell pansies and other annuals and plants that cannot survive our summer (do you know anyone in this part of AZ who grows gardenias?!?)  This is not the place to go for native plants that will survive and thrive in Az.

The customer service at Wells Fargo continues to amaze me. This is the first time that I visited this branch. I usually go to the WF down the road, but ended up here today to have a cashiers check made.   Immediately upon entering, I received a "welcome to Wells Fargo" greeting by a smiling, friendly employee. I was asked if I need help from a banker.    Went to the window where I was greeted by another smiling face. The teller was friendly, helpful and efficient.   I've completely converted from the credit union to WF for my banking needs.   The customer service can't be beat!

This is the only place where I buy bread. Forget the grocery store and its high price on bread!  I've never had a problem with buying bread here.  Awesome prices and super friendly employees.  They give you a free loaf of bread with a seven dollar purchase. They also have a punchcard program. Wednesdays are double punch day!  Redeem you card for free items when you fill a card. The bread keeps well in the freezer so stock up!  Bagels,  English muffins,  loaf bread and more!  Several name brands to choose from - Sara Lee, Oroweat, Entemman sweets, Bob' Red Mill, etc.

This is our favorite Circle K.    Large convenience store with a variety of fresh grab and go breakfast and lunch items.  Lots of Slurpie flavors (although I will note that more often than not, many of the flavors are unavailable when we stop in due to freeze thaw cycle).  Gas pumps.  Cold drinks.    I guess that it pretty much is an average run of the mill convenience store except for the fact that they have AMAZING customer service.  They are always friendly and helpful.  Never had a bad experience.  Although I wish that all of the Slurpie machines were available to use more often.

When we want good pizza, we go to Barros. It's best when eaten in the restaurant - fresh and hot. I don't think pizza travels well in a box - it starts to steam and it affects the crust.   Good service, good pizza, good prices, clean, efficient and friendly employees.  Plenty of TV's to watch the game.   Lunch specials.    No complaints!

Saw this new shop at Chandler Fashion Center and had to check it out!  What a great shop !  Every imaginable type of balsamic and olive oil. Tons of yummy dips, spreads, spice mixes, etc.   They have samples throughout the entire shop. One of the best things is that you don't have to buy a large amount of any given flavor. The prices start out with 100 ml for around $4-$5.  This is unlike most shops like this. My experience had been that you have to buy a much larger amount which is obviously more expensive. It's also nice because you can buy smaller amounts of several different flavor sand not break the bank.   They have bottles you can buy in the shop or you can bring your own bottles into the store.   These are some of the friendliest employees that I've experienced in a long time.  They are engaging, interactive and full of knowledge about what they are selling.   Many of the items would be great to have on hand to use as hostess gifts or birthday gifts. I'm already thinking sticking stuffers!    I'm a fan!

I was so disappointed with my visit to this store tonight .    When I walked into the store, there were three employees all standing behind the cash registers talking and talking and talking. Only one other customer was in the store.   I was in the store for at least 20 minutes and did not receive a single acknowledgment.  The three employees remained behind the registers. I heard one employee identify herself as Debbie.   Terrible customer service, employees obviously need more training.   I don't plan on returning. I'd rather go to Origins - I've always received fantastic service and friendly employees in their shop.
