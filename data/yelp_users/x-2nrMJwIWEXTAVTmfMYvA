Ordered our food over an hour ago, We understand a busy Friday night. When I called to check on our order, the girl on the phone couldn't even tell us where our food was or when it would be here. Really? So is it coming or not coming..... To eat or not to eat .... That is the question.

If negative stars were available, this place would get them!!!! Absolute idiots. You have one job and that's to make a pizza and you can't even get that right. Not only were the toppings wrong but they didn't cut it either. I called them and they have very poor communication skills also!!!!! Dominos pizza is horrible anyways!!!! Can't even believe I ordered from there in the first place!!! So much for being close and convenient!!!!!!

I have lived here for a year and 6 mo. I am a pretty difficult, high maintenance person sometimes. The staff here has always gone out of their way to be more than accommodating. Things happen. If you have an issue, these people will make sure when the issue is resolved that you are satisfied.

I ordered take out for two,during breakfast .(steak and eggs with gritts, biscuits,and gravy) I placed my biscuits on top off my gritts, put my eggs on top of my biscuits and poored my gravy over all of it. As I dove into my ' heart attack waiting to happen', I dicovered a very thick, black hair, aproximatley 3 inches in length. Needless to say , I didnt finish my meal.

Charles ( our waiter ) took really good care of us by listening to our likes and found menu items that satisfied  our urges. He could not have done a better job pairing our wines with our entrees. A true gentleman , thank you!

I've been coming here for about two years now. ( once in a while ) I purchased tanning packages which are considerably less money than single tans. ( this seems Like a good value ) when o started coming here I use to complain about little things, like a bulb being out in a bed. Being new, I didn't  know one bulb didn't make much difference. I just knew that I was paying for all of them to work. When ever I encountered this and mentioned it , they gave me a free tan (NICE CUSTOMER SERVICE, made me feel good!) My lotion was misplaced once,and it was almost empty anyways. They sold me my next one at more than likely, their cost. ( I think that was the owner, I wish I new her name , she is super nice. ( AGAIN GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, MADE ME FEEL GOOD.) Another time I forgot my lotion at home ( I dont leave it the salon anymore after my first one was misplaced.) that time another pleasant woman gave me a sample pack to use. ( AGAIN GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!)   So ..... What drove me to post this, was my last experience. I was at home hanging out by the pool trying to squeeze in the last few Rays of sun after work, and didn't feel like I got it done ,so I jumped in my truck ,and drove to the salon. I got there and was out of tanning sessions , I was in my swim trunks with no cards or money, and was going to head home when HAILEY who is a very pleasant smilie young lady ,told me to go ahead and tan, and that I could pay, next time I came. AGAIN, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! THIS PLACE IS TRULY A CLASS ACT FULL OF CLASSY EMPLOYEES!!! I GIVE MAJOR KUDOS TO THE OWNER OR THE MANAGER WHO HAS BUILT THIS CULTURE AND EMPOWERED THE EMPLOYEES TO BE CAPABLE OF SUCH CUSTOMER SERVICE. THESE PEOPLE TRULY CARE ABOUT YOUR SATISFACTION. They also do nails, hair and sell boutique items...check this place out for all of your needs if you care about quality!!!!

Was here 2 years ago. They've added a sit down bar. Interesting variety of unique salsa. Small place but not cramped. We all tried different tacos. Was fun .

This is a review revolving around several negative interactions with this office in person, and on the telephone. In person Dr Rodriguez did not address our issues. My wife left the office feeling so bad about her visit with Dr Rodriguez, that we scheduled another visit with Dr Rodriguez. For this Visit Her Mother attended. This time she felt so frustrated by the lack of communication and understanding by Dr Rodriguez that she was actually in tears, crying during this visit.   While trying to schedule and communicate with Dr Rodriguez's assistant Jocelyn, she would not listen or let me complete a sentence and actually told me that if I wasn't going to listen to her our conversation was over. SHE HUNG UP THE PHONE ON ME.    I called to talk to the office manager. Becky is her name. She had the nerve to tell me that my wife and I needed to get on the same page before I called back again. These people are very difficult to work with and very unprofessional. They have made us feel so uncomfortable that we do not feel welcome here. Very sad!

Went with friends on a busy Friday night. Every one was friendly. Food was fast. Four of us gorged ourselves on rolls, sashimi , beer, and saki and had a tab under $100.
