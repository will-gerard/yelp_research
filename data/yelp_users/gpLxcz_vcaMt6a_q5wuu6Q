The food was worth the wait! Stood in line for 45 minutes but was distracted by the entertainment and ease of socializing.  Had a couple of local brews and ordered their famous Bacon Green Chile Cheese Burger.  WARNING, all of the burgers are 1/2 pound so you better be in the mood for some serious chowing down.  So sad this place is closing its doors in less than a month from now.  The land is owned by the state and will be up for auction.

Very good Mexican spice coffee, the prices are a little on the high side but worth it when you get fresh ingredients in all the food!

Took my 2 year old nephew here for "Toddler Tuesday" (where you pay half-price for kids under 4: $4.50 vs. reg. $9). We read the rules before hand and left all snacks and drinks at home, and walk it to find parents drinking lattes from Starbucks... The front lobby includes a huge (in comparison to the size of the building) candy store (of course where the candy is low enough for the children to get into) and the snack bar serves mostly junk food: candy, pizza, cotton candy, soda, icees, etc. although they did have juice box, organic milk and gogurt. The parent seating was limited unless you wanted to be in the snack area (a separate room from the play area and this would be necessary if busy)  Was disappointed that the "Play" factory had a video game and movie set up... Although I saw the staff vacuuming play area and cleaning the restrooms, overall the play area felt dirty (dust under and around back of play area, netting in play area is brown), and I was extremely displeased to see the exposed electrical outlets, unpadded wall corners and the 1ft step to get in and out of the main play area (difficult for a 2 year old to get over)  Overall, I feel like deep down there is a great idea here, unfortunately the execution was cheap and poorly done...  Hope they use their profit to destroy this play area and try again, otherwise not sure we will be back...

Took longer than expected to get our pick-up order but it was worth it!

The owner's story of how he incorporated previous restaurants he owned and operated in Cal and Washington was pretty cool to see in a family breakfast joint such as this.  The building use to be an old Denny's so it has that classic dinner feel but the interior definitely is more Caly.  The menu states the importance of how all the food and ingredients are either organic or locally based, coffee included.  My wife was on a gluten-free diet at the time so having the wide variety of menu options made her happy, in fact the pancakes she had were the best (GF) she's ever had.  I stuck with one of their specialties, "Chxn-fried-Chxn" which came with a side of French Toast.  I would recommend getting a fresh topping on the French Toast, such as banana pecan, though it tastes good without as well.  The service was excellent even though it was busy. The owner was helping the staff in a variety of ways while keeping a smile, which is always a good thing to see.  The overall quality to portion ratio was excellent and the pricing was reasonable.  The coffee was so good I took some on the go.  The only thing it's lacking is a larger seating area, noticed families had to split booths among each other.

My wife and I went to the wild horse pass resort last year for our anniversary and loved it, so when we got a free room voucher for Vee Quiva we were pretty excited to celebrate our following anniversary there.  The rooms were just as good as wild horse pass but everything else about the resort was sub-par.    We were shocked the pool closes at 9pm but after walking by to see it I could understand why, there wasn't a bartender staffed at the bar and the scene there looked like something you would see at a retirement home.  There wasn't even a single person in the pool and no music to help distract you from the mello crowd, guess that's what headphones are for.  We decided to try out the bingo hall and later regret that decision.  We've been to all the other major bingo halls around Phoenix but this one had different games and drawings taking place that we had never seen before.  After making it clear to the bingo teller we needed further explanation we were immediately given the "read today's gaming sheet".  Make sure you bring in food because if you get hungry you have to fight everyone off during intermission to get in line at the food court inside the casino.    The 24/7 coffee house cafe was advertising their prime rib special ($7.99) but of course when heading over to it we were greeted by a large sign stating it was closed for maintenance after 10pm.  It was 11 at the time and their were still tables being used.  The staff couldn't give us a clear answer as to when they re-open but we found out the following day it was open early in the morning.    My not so favorite part of my stay was the harassment given by security staff when entering the casino from the hotel.  Their piss poor attitude towards guess and poor customer service was mind boggling to us.  We were told (not politely) to dump out or chug our beers that we took from our room before entering the casino floor.  When explaining to them we weren't aware of their policy and were apologetic the security guy responds with "just get rid of them" with a confrontational tone.  The second time around we were pulled aside because our red bulls smelled like they had "a hint of alcohol" in them, which there wasn't.  I told the security guard (different) she was mistaken but we would be cooperative.  She of course gives me a scowl look and doesn't say anything...had to ask people near by if I said something wrong and they were just as puzzled.  On a more positive note, their were a couple BJ dealers and pit bosses that were great to talk to and accommodating as well.  In fact, a slot machine tenet looked all over the casino to find a slot that had my lucky numbers listed on its sticker for me, which made my night!

My first time at this place and it was awesome! The sandwich special for the month was a Shrimp Po'Boy with Voodoo kettle chips and had the perfect southern Cajun taste. Really like the $3 PBJ sandwiches they have, which they donate a new sandwich to the 'PBJ Project'!

Have been going to this location since the first day they opened.  The staff always have a smile on their face and great personalities.  I've had a few special requests and they were more than helpful and willing.  Love using the DD Perks app and getting discounted or even free iced coffee drinks!
