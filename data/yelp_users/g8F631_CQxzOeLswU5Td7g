On name alone we HAD to check this place out, just for kicks.  Ouch!  Bandaids indeed; this place hurts and not in a good way. And you might want to spritz that with some iodine for good measure.  I've got no qualms with talent, don't get me wrong; the female form is a beautiful thing to behold in all of its varied curve-tastic shape and form. A woman is a woman is a beautiful woman, and I'm a sucker. By default, naked womanhood warrants an automatic 3-star baseline from me, but the slummy and desperate atmosphere in this dive is a soulsuck for all that dare enter.  The squat brick building sits all by its lonesome under a tacky illuminated "Bandaids Show Lounge" sign, the surrounding parking lot emanating with "damn, I'mma get mugged out here" uncertainty and darkness.  Once inside (yes, you go in through a sketchy looking front door that looks as welcoming as the sketchy looking service door), you're met by security and carded; the girls headed for the bar while another friend and myself were subjected to a [sub-standard*] pat down - *sub-standard: the folding knife clipped and visible in my front pocket (CA law) went unnoticed.  A printed "no sideways caps, no baggy/saggy jeans, no long tees" dress code posted by the door should have been a red flag. Classy!  After getting a few beers from the pretty bartender (she was actually really, really good-looking - hottest girl on staff, setting false precedent for what the stage talent would look like), we made our way past shady regulars at the bar with their necks crook'd to the lounge, finding a couple of tables near, but not next to, the center stage.  Most of us sat talking and laughing with each other, occasionally glancing at the stage just to see what's up and watching the depraved humanity of the other patrons in the place, mostly empty on a Friday night... ... the out-of-towner business man in the dark corner, getting dances from any girl that would come his way. ... the mouth-breather waiting with stalker-ish anticipation for a dance with one of the, er, more amply-bossomed strippers. ... the table of youngins, dressed exactly how the posted dress code prohibited.  Girl after girl (a couple of "a'ight" girls, most "everyday" girls, and at least one "is that a girl?" girls) came to the stage, gyrated to cliche strip club music - some exhibiting-gymnast calibre pole skills and limberness - then cruised the showroom floor, peddling their wares with a repeated-to-monotone-perfection "...would you like a dance?  ...would you like a dance?" propositioning. Sales Basics 101: Always Be Closing, right?  None of us partook in the festivities, but two friends in an adjoining party did.  One, quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it.  The other, a recent migrant from war-torn and fundamentalist Afghanistan, got one of the [few] Barbie-esque dancers who would keep him entranced and occupied for 4-5 songs... and about $100.  After a quick 30 minutes, we'd thought we'd seen the whole rotation of "meh" talent and skeevy behavior.  And that's when we saw it... ...the epitome of tacky divey strip club attire... ...the summation of the Bandaids experience... ...that's when we saw it...   ...The HOOD-KINI*!  It was time to leave... quickly. As we braved the parking lot,  it was joke after FirstAid-alluding and Infectious-disease related joke. Automatic hilarity at the mere mention during the rest of our trip.  "Band-Aids", because correlating "possibility of infection" and adult entertainment is savvy business sense. ____________________ Yes, yes.  A hooded bikini. In black and neon. A hood to obscure her face, while thin straps and patches of material covered her naughty bits.  A. Hooded.  Bikini.  If she were gonna take your money, she might as well look the part.

Unfortunately, I'd broken my ankle two weeks before I was supposed to go on this Phoenix trip and couldn't participate, but nonetheless, we'd planned on hitting this climbing facility with friends and so we did; incapacitated, I was still eager to see my friends take to the walls...  This gym has some awesome [looking] routes!  For those of us accustomed to seeing an"abcd" rating system (i.e. 5.10a, 5.10b, etc), its a little bit mysterious and enticing that this place uses a "+/-" rating system.  Esco said it was actually exciting to go into a climb with no preconceived estimation of its difficulty; just get on the wall and climb. And it seemed the skill set required from one climb to the next  could be drastically different - from wide slow static climbs demanding of a strong core and limber/flexible reach, to climbs requiring dynos from contorted postures and awkward launches...  The climbing walls here see quite a bit of wear, evident by the exposed wooden surface underneath the paint that has been worn away in places; smooth wooden surface atop a welded metal framework, not much different structurally. However, the lack of textured wall surfaces renders most of the ascents a straightforward use of grips and footchips; stemming and smearing is hard to do on a smoothfaced wall.  At first, we were concerned that with myself laid up in crutches we would have only one certified belay person for our group of 4, but Phoenix Rock allows people to belay after just a 10minute video orientation and brief hands-on instruction.  A great place for groups of beginners!  The staffer who assisted us was a charismatic and friendly guy by the name of Gravity.  Really.  Great nickname for a climbing gym staffer, right?  He made our newer climbers comfortable with their equipment and took special care to relay and emphasize all the safety precautions and practices of rock climbing and belaying. Throughout the day, as he made his rounds through the gym, he'd occasionally come by to coach our newer climbers and offer tips and advice to our more adept climbers attempting difficult ascents.  Altogether a nice climbing gym with a homegrown decor and vibe.  I wish I had the chance to climb here and experience the different route/rating system, but even from the sidelines, I can say this is an awesome place.  If ever I'm back in Phoenix (and back on my feet!), I'm checking this place out again. ________________________ They (or at least Gravity) would have let me climb one-legged... he himself having broke both of his ankles and took a break from climbing before could tell I was fiend'ing...

At the end of 2009's "SBC Goes to Vegas" epic comedy/tragedy, JMC, Cobber, and I spent one last day in Vegas, the start of which JMC led us to this spot overlooking the Venetian Canal. We imbibed carafe after carafe of a delicious sangria. I took note.  This year, at the end of a traditional/annual BFF/coworker trip, Sarah E, Sarah M, KarKar, and I spent an extra day in Vegas, the start of which led us to this same spot for lunch, touting it's sangria. It did not disappoint my hazy recollection.  We were quickly seated by the hostess, the restaurant/"patio" on the waterfront being sparsely occupied on a Tuesday afternoon. Julio, our server - an elder but spirited gentleman - came over with menus, introduced himself, and immediately prompted us for drinks to start... "A pitcher of sangria, please?" "Excellente. Four glasses? "Yes, please. Thank you."  With drinks on their way and requisite chips & salsa on the table, lunch/sustenance was in order. Both Sarahs ordered the Tres Tacos plates while KarKar went with lighter fare, having a bowl of the Corn & Green Chile Soup. I ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, thinking it would be like... um, one big quesadilla, but they (3) were [pleasantly] more akin to grill flattened/pressed tacos.  The Corn & Green Chile soup was flavorful! A bit of sweet from the corn, heat from the green chile, a hearty fullness of potato, and depth/salt from smoked bacon.  The taco combination platters and the smoked chicken quesadilla plate satisfying and freshly flavored. Each taco was dressed with toppings complimentary to their filling - shredded chicken salpicon, mushrooms with queso blanco/fresco, and [grilled] fish with a pineapple salsa. The three palm-sized smoked chicken quesadillas are heavy with chicken and cheese. Both platters come garnished with a sharp and tangy serano slaw, black beans, and fresh flavorful cilantro rice.  Back to what brought us here... the Sangria.  Now its hard to tell (especially in Vegas) just how good/effective a sangria can be. It's *meant* to creep, right? (JM, Cobes, and I went 2-3 carafes not realizing the fade!) But I must say, the sangria here is good. Not too tart, not too sweet. Retains the silken feel of red wine and the warm flush of brandy is subtle. It's a slow ride into troubled waters. What a perfect way to ease into the crazy. Gimme more!  Safe to say, for casual dining, good people watching, and a creeper of a drink, I'd gladly add Canonita to the yearly tradition. _________________________________________________ No, really. I have a note to myself on my phone from last year...  "Must do Sangria again!" I don't remember writing it.

Ooh.  Um... THE SUCK...  The few of us who somehow woke before noon walked about the Miracle Mile shops in search of some breakfast eats.  Unfortunately, we stumbled upon this joint and had too little mental acuity to give it a once over before deciding...  The decor and theme would be perfect if it were an outdoor restaurant, not so much under a faux sky in a darkened corner of a mall.  Service was responsive, though that probably had a lot to do with us being only the second party in the establishment.  Our server did comp me a grapefruit juice when it turned out that they weren't out...  But the menu.  Ech.  Not a one (of the four of us) were happy with our meals.  Yes, its primarily a seafood and wine bar, but REALLY?  How do you screw up AND be chintzy on breakfasts and salads?  I dare say, I've had better for cheaper at Denny's...

4 Star food... 5 Star experience  Lawry's is a great middle ground steakhouse (okay, more so prime rib) restaurant for those who want better than the neighborhood Outback but would rather not drop Alexander's-esque money.  In my opinion, the prime rib at Lawry's is in the company of Ruth's Chris and Morton's, all the while being a touch gentler on the pocket book...  The decor is fancy and refined enough to be impressive and date-worthy; valet parking, leather couches  and a stone fireplace adorn the lobby/reception, dim lighting, a mellow bar, a spacious dining room.  All the while, this location in particular [Vegas], also seems open to the casual "propriety be d@mned" customer base probably isn't uncommon for this town...  Service on this night was excellent!  Our server, Ms. Hughes, was fast, attentive, and personable; checking on us throughout the night, taking the ladies' orders first (a nice touch!), serving the ladies first, suggesting accompaniments, pouring our wines... She was matron-like in her charm and attention...  Part of the allure here is the spectacle/show they make of service.  Order wine?  The server pours it for you in with a flamboyant move, cascading a stream of wine from some height into a swirling glass.  The salad course, which is included in the price of any size prime rib entree, is prepared table-side; the server rapidly spins a stainless steel bowl in a large vessel of ice, adding condiments and dressing, gingerly mixing the salad within until the bowl comes to a halt.    And then there's the prime rib. Like House of Prime Rib, anticipation of when one of those big chrome carts of prime rib will finally tend to your table helps build your hunger and makes the experience fun.  The cart arrives, the carver wields his blade, and the server asks you "what type of cut and what temperature would you like that?"...its on...!  Now for the price of the prime rib dinner, ranging from $31 for the California Cut, to $34 for the Lawry Cut, to $40(?) for some "this is ridiculous, who can eat all this?" cut... the price also includes the spinning salad, 2 choices of a number of sides, and Yorkshire pudding...  So, if you've already broken the bank on craziness on the strip... Lawry's is a nice escape just a couple blocks off the strip...

... I'm only 5'5".  For the bartender to hear me over the din of noise and ruckus, I had to lean up and over the bar a bit.  That's when she made her move.  She was an attractive and curvaceous woman, maybe 5-6 years my senior at most, a half-drank Cosmo(?) in one hand... the other hand... firmly posited upon my derriere.  "Oh, hi... "  I squeak, a bit taken aback. "Hey there... " she singsongs. "... eh, you having a good time?" I query. "mmmmmHmmmmm... I always do... you?" "..oh yeah, yeah..."  After some conversation and flirty banter, the bartender, either oblivious or desensitized to such comedy, brings my drinks over and gives me the tab.  "Let me get those for you, Hon..." she offered, gesturing to the bartender to put it on her tab. "Oh, no, thank you I'll..." "My treat" she protests.  Pressed against me she says, "Come find me in a little bit, okay?" as she takes one last chance to let her hand wander.  I never did see her again that night.  Perhaps she had caught some new prey... She treated me like so much meat. I felt cheap. I felt dirty.  I kinda really sorta liked it... =)  ________________________________ Oh, the actual hotel and casino?  For the SUPER CHEAP RATES you can get on southwestvacations.com, its really not that bad, if you don't mind staying way off at the end of the strip.  Don't let the fact that you can SEE it fool you, its friggin' far!  Cab fares will eat your budget up...  The 7th floor saltwater pool is really awesome though.  I highly recommend laying out up there, if you stay at this hotel.  Nevermind the topless pool on the 21st(?) floor, its kinda *meh*.  Poly Esther's Nightclub here APPEARS to be a jumpin place, if a bit gimmicky and un-Vegas-y in regards to chic and hype.  There are at least two really good cover bands that play at the casino/stage/bar towards the back that kept me entertained as SE tore through a Hold'em tourney (never underestimate the pretty girl, she's a shark...!)  My encounter with Lady McGrab-@ss happened at the main bar in the middle of the casino.  ... ah, Vegas, where "hey, i never get picked up on at home" happens.

[teaser review]  Food?  3 stars, bratwursts and schnitzels and obaszter, Oh my!  Drinks?  4 stars... ONE... LITER... BEERS.  I had two in about a half hour.  Fun?  5 stars.  Mona.  You reeled back and swung that paddle at my tush like it was a home run derby!  You said I must be used to eating sausage.  You called me a p*ssy for only throwing down 2 liters of beer.  I think I'm in love with you.  [end teaser]   ============   For starters, out party of twenty had the simple and accessible pretzel appetizer; a huge, coarsely-salted, baked pretzel served with dipping mustard (one tangy, one sweet) and a tasty obaszter cheese... This appetizer was unremarkable but appropriately festive for the beer drinking that would soon ensue...  As the fiery-spirited and lovely Mona made her rounds taking drink orders, our party would erupt into booing and jeers toward the few who ordered anything less than the 1-liter stein of beer, often harassing them into ordering big... I opted for the 1-liter dunkelweiss, a dark bier, toasty @ 5.5% alcohol.  Oh, if only they had the Maibock at the time (7.1%)!  The menu offers a varied selection of Bavarian dishes, many to do with wursts.  Most were of two varieties; either wursts(sausages) served in sandwiches (w/fries) or wursts plates (usually with cabbage, or potatoes - mashed or salad).  A number of dishes present the sausages afloat in a small cauldron of simmering beer/broth... tasty, but visually unappealing, IMO.  I went with the Riesenwurst, a grilled sausage with sauerkraut, served on french bread...   Making up for having slept through this part of the Vegas trip last year, I chug'd chug'd chug'd away, finishing my liter first, raising my empty glass to applause and laughs.  But as I reveled in my accomplishment, a dirndl-dress clad Mona would set down another liter in front of me... slack-jaw'd and puppydog-eyed, I looked at her.  Her response?  With a wink and a smile, she says "Come on, I can put down 5 of these..."  Somehow I got through it.  2 liters of dunkelweiss.  One riessenwurst and sauerkraut sandwich.  A pint of Summer bier.    Then she looked at me, "... another?" "Oh dear gawd, no, please!" I stutter.  She smirked and walked away.  I guess we weren't NEAR done just yet.  And then came shots of apple brandy served on a wooden paddle... and the paddling.  Yes, paddling.  With me bent over the end of a table, Mona reached into my back pocket to take out my wallet, insuring nothing would get in the way...  Twenty friends counted her down.. "one", "two", "THREE!"... as she swung for the fences... THWACK!!  I didn't flinch, but it hurt like crazygood!    Like crazy... good.  I asked for another. __________________________ Yup, kinda got a crush on Mona... Foul-mouthed, emasculating, paddle-swinging hotness.  I've got issues, don't I?

A requisite Vegas buffet experience, IMO, second on my Vegas "faves" list to Le Village @ Paris [http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-village-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:W7aoVNIZ1KeVYlTDfAqNrQ].  As part of an annual summer Vegas trip, the dinner Buffet @ Bellagio has become a staple in our "Day 2" itinerary; smartly scheduled in anticipation that our collective hangovers from the first evening has not been appetite-debilitating.  Buffets are a quandary for me.  Stocky and brutish as I may appear, I was actually much much heftier before, and being mindful of my weight and diet is usually counter-intuitive to all things "all you can eat".  Even so, with some will power and a discipline to try just the more uncommon dishes, little delectable tastes of lots of extravagant foods can be enjoyed WITHOUT getting stuffed...  ... after all, its hard to maintain what little bit of cute I've got going on, and this is Vegas, the cute has to always be on... _________________________ Oh, Vegas.  There are super-secksified people even in these gluttony-inducing troves of culinary delight...

(...one-star for my girl who kept her cool when things went to sh*t...)  *sigh*  I used to like Tao.  Used to.  Past tense.   But the reprehensible and abysmal customer service we recently encountered on numerous fronts border on cataclysmic.  Ill Communication... (Beastie Boys, 1993) 10 days prior to Vegas, more than one person in our entourage attempted, valiantly and persistently to secure guest list accommodations, all to no avail, no recourse, no reply, no acknowledgment from Tao staff/management.  Fine... it happens.  The Tipping Point... (The Roots, 2004) So, uncertain of our status on the guest list, we made a conscious effort to arrive early to stand in line, arrayed in a 16 girls to 6 guys ratio, the ladies looking delectably hot and the gents dapper smooth (or at least passable... meh!). For over an hour prior to opening, we stood there (at the front of the line), as did countless others behind us, until a security/bouncer announced, "regrettably" of course, that they had over booked the guest lists and no general admission guests would get in.  Hmmph...  Frustrating and a ridiculous, considering those guest-lists were in circulation all night and some idea that they were over-booked should have been evident much much sooner.  But fine... that kind of thing happens too, I suppose...  By All Means Necessary... (Boogie Down Productions, 1988) At this point, KT, in her most tactful and professional demeanor (... and a vivaciously flattering top...), set out to see what could be done.  We were told to go ahead and just get in the guest-list line.  Then told we weren't on the guest-lists.  Then directed to speak with "that guy"... who told us to talk to "this guy"... who said to KT, "Sorry, there's nothing I can do, try another club".  Wow, really?  Stakes is High... (De La Soul, 1996) During the horrific menagerie outside, three friends, assured we would get in, threw down the $grand for table/bottle service and were awaiting our arrival inside.  Aghast that we were turned away, they negotiated for 7 of us (5 girls, 2 guys) to get in; the other half our crew had gotten in by just walking up to the counter as-if they were on the guest-lists (Bum Rush The Show... Public Enemy, 1987).  As it would turn out, another doorman would demand that we purchase another bottle @ $300 for the admission.  Hmmmm, really?  Your bottle service, as it were, allots 3 guests per bottle and there were only three people inside with three bottles.  Ludicrous.  Tougher Than Leather... (Run DMC, 1988) So, we walked away... no club is worth that much stress, drama, and runaround.  Yeah, I used to like Tao... USED TO. _______________________________________ BIG-UP BIG-UP BIG-UP!  Some of you guys were cool (clip-board guy with the faux-hawk and the Polynesian guys),for trying to do all you coulda/woulda for my girls/crew, thank you much anyway.

Ah, the Venetian!  Though I can't afford it very often(...er, often... eh...ever...), the Venetian is undoubtedly my favorite hotel on the Strip (which probably contributes to my fondness of Grand Lux)!  On this trip, we caught a late dinner here post-Blue Man Group...  Location-wise, the "patio'd" dining area of Grand Lux has a great view for people watching, looking out upon the escalator landing that meets the casino floor to the parking structure and shopping center.  And the people watching here is excellent... the sexy, the desperate, the suave, the chic, the buffoonery!  The interior/exterior is inline with the vibe and feel of the Venetian, simple-chic , with notable designerly touches of old-country influence and theme .    Grand Lux is by no means a fancy-shmancy bistro.  It is, in essence and actuality, a well-dressed upscale Cheesecake Factory affiliated establishment.  And for the intent and perspective of casual ambiance, generous portions, affordable dining, it's well suited...  The puree'd Butternut Squash and ginger soup was a great start to the late night meal; delicately sweet with a subtle tartness.  Only one person had ordered it, but it was so good, she insisted on passing it around amongst the five of us.  It was that good...  I had the Spicy Flat Bread Chicken Sandwich;  sharable serving of four triangular flatbread sandwiches set atop a platter of fries.  A smokey-spiciness from the chicken and the pepperjack cheese is offset by a cool avocado-corn salsa.  I ate half and saved the other have for breakfast.  Also around the table was the chili-cheese topped jumbo Kobe Hotdog (w/fries), the Braised Pot Roast dinner, and the Chicken Royale (w/ white wine butter sauce)... everything tasted good (the cool thing about foodies, if they've got something good, they like to share!)   Our bill for the food (sans drinks)?  Just north of $60.  It's one of the better (if not one of the best!) casual after-midnight menus on the strip... with the bonus of watching an entertaining  parade of people.

============================= a "what?! I didn't post this yet?" review =============================  Ah, mon amis, Le Village?  C'est tres magnifique... !  Even if you don't speak French (I haven't retained a lick of 3 years of H.S. French aside from "do you speak English?" and "would you go to bed with me?"), I'm sure you're fluent enough in "foodie" to understand...   Located in the opulent Paris Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, Le Village is my favorite buffet amongst the "big" hotels, rivaled closely by the monstrosity of a buffet over at Bellagio (of course, I am just another wh0rish tourist, so what do I know... Hi, Vegas Yelpers!!) and a Vegas junket just isn't complete until we've brunch'd here.  Just steps away from the cobblestone path, under a painted sky, you'll find a low-lit French village facade representing a general culinary summation of five French provinces.  It's a kitschy-cute setting, cottages crafted and modeled with a little cartoon-iness which is either endearing (a la Disney's "It's A Small World") or will make you kvetch (also a la Disney's "It's A Small World")...  Because of the French theme and focus to regional namesakes, the offerings at Le Village are prepared with a modicum of practice and expertise, achieving, I assume, a notable reflection and taste of common French dishes (though, not being astute to the nuances of French cuisine, I could be blissfully ignorantly wrong!).  Creme sauces, wine reductions, puffed pastries, and savory dishes aplenty!  For lighter/smaller appetites, there is a [regrettably unremarkable] salad bar, chilled seafood bar, a selection of cheeses, and a pastry bar, though these seem a bit like an afterthought in comparison to the entree areas.  Peach (apricot?) Duck.  Lamb Cheek Stew.  Scallops.  Etcetera etcetera!!  So, if you're going to have single all-day-sustaining, pre-drunken state, $20-some-odd-number, "let's buffet because we're in Vegas" meal... I'd consider Le Village...  Allez !  Allez !  Ce'tait genial!

Guest1:  (in English) So, um, are you serving oxtail soup tonight? Waiter: (in heavy pidgin) S'afta eeleven?  Sure t'ing, cous.  You wan get? Guest2:  (in English)  Great!  I'll have the oxtail soup...! Guest3: (in English)  Yeah, me too!  Oxtail soup...! Guest4: (in English)... oxtail soup... Guest1: (all of sudden in pidgin)  Oh, I like get da oxtail soup den... plus one saimin... en da portugee sausage en eggs to go, yeah?  ... everyone stares, including the waiter.... then laughter... aloha loa!  Its such an oddity to find, but a welcome comfort to know that this place (and the California Hotel) is just a short ride over from the Strip, in case one gets tired of mega-fusion-hybrid cuisine.  The restaurant and amenities themselves are run-of-the-mill Old Downtown Vegas... vinyl, faux-brass, fake dark-lacquered-wood tables, awful carpeting, etcetera etcetera.  But spacious for the most part, and accommodating to bigger groups... we ended up having a party of 8, though I saw a few parties in the restaurant numbering in the dozens.  The service is top notch here!  From the smiling older Japanese auntie who greeted-and-seated us, to the young howsit-brah who served us, to the big-as-a-house but cheery and laid-back Polynesian securing the front... it was very homey and unpretentious...  The food is decent, for diner renditions of generally home-cooked Hawaiian-Asian fare.  The oxtail soup is plentiful with meat, tender from cooking all day long in the fairly flavorful broth.  I personally expected/would have liked a slightly tangier broth.  The Portuguese Sausage and Eggs over rice looked delicious in its simplicity; a breakfast plate that brings me back to my youth.  The saimin came out steaming hot and all I could think about was standing outside on an early early morning in front of a Zippy's shack on Oahu... mmm fishcake!  I'll be going back, for sure...

Polyester.  Yes, its a cheap and durable material, but its uncomfortable and stuffy and makes for giggly fun when someone rocks a 1970's vintage polyester leisure suit.  The club?  Just as cheap, but uncomfortable and stuffy.  Only, without the fun and giggles.  Regardless of the polyester leisure suits, technicolor afros, or ridonkulously flared jeans...  The decor is gimmicky and tacky, which would have been a fine fit for the themed nightclub IF it weren't executed so half-@ss...  At $40 for the "all you can drink [well-drinks]" cover, the ghetto-trashtastic crowd is ALMOST bearable... almost.  For the most part, the same human refuse and deviance found in other clubs can be found here in higher concentration, less pretense, and more desperation.  Ech!  This is the nightclub for you if... 1) you REALLY need a mix of 70's/80's/90's/00's music, and/or 2) you just CANNOT deal with the bureaucracy of getting into higher-end club.  If you must, bring your own crew/dance-partners with you... and an anti-skeeve handwash. ____________________ +1 for a little flirty-flirty... =)

The last morning of our annual Vegas trip (actually, it was almost noon by the time we checked out), we walked around New York New York with a hankering for breakfast.  And beer... we also thought of beer.  Nine Fine Irishmen!  The dimly lit interior was a little off-putting when we knew it was bright mid-day outside, but the faux-"countryside" Irish pub decor was charming, the hostesses and wait-staff very friendly, and the menu intriguing. We were seated in a cozy corner booth and eagerly waited upon. We started "breakfast" with two beers, "we have to" Sarah insisted; a Guinness over Magners for her, a Boddington pub ale for me.  Sarah ordered the [starter] Guinness braised beef and mushroom pies w/ tomato relish and chive dressing and [breakfast] stack of pancakes with strawberries. I got the [traditions] Irish breakfast of two eggs, rashers of bacon, bangers, black & white puddings, roasted tomato and sautéed mushrooms. Great service - I didn't know what black and white puddings were and inquired; the server said "blood sausage" in a delicate manner, commenting that the name dissuades some people from trying it. Glancing over at Sarah, we cheer "It sounds good! We're all about that!"  While you wait, they bring out a big overflowing basket of crusty bread and big triangular wedges of butter. One could get full on that alone.  By Sarah's estimation, the meat pies, after some giggling ponderance, tastes like (and this is not a knock, more like pleasantly reminiscent of) McD's cheeseburgers! The fried pastry shell, tender meaty filling, the tomato relish, the chive dressing... it comes together like a cheeseburger with ketchup and pickles!  The stack of pancakes with strawberry compote and whipped cream was an eyeful. The cakes themselves were large and fluffy, griddled to a crispy exterior. The strawberry compote wasn't overly sweet or syrupy, retaining a tangy snap of fresh fruit. Add a big dollop of whipped cream and there was little need for syrup at all.  My Irish breakfast plate was simple and straightforward. A couple of cooked-to-order eggs, strips of bacon, serving of rashers (like corned beef hash?), a sausage, the black and white puddings (a dark and a light blood sausage), and a whole roasted tomato. Clean and comforting breakfast staples. With the pint of Bodington and a slice or two of buttered bread, its a hearty meal, perfect for those hazy hungover mornings.  A good find to mark the end a good time. A fun restaurant in one of my fave hotels. I'll definitely be coming back here again. _______________________________________ Sarah out-drank me two pints to one at breakfast!! Ah, Vegas! All about beating the odds!

-Room- The spacious room (#20sumsum'n), sparingly accented with props/posters from the 1976 film Logan's Run, was designerly, despite the few bits of cinematic tackiness.    The accommodations, though we were rarely actually IN the room to enjoy them, were luxurious.  Two large and comfortable queen beds with floor to ceiling padded/felt headboards (oooh, rough!).  Two "I can drunkenly sleep right here" lounge chairs, a humongous dresser/entertainment center w/42"+ flatscreen teevee, and a simple desk round out the furnishings.  Our window, though large and [potentially] picturesque, faced out to the east(?) towards very little of a view.  Also note, in-room intarwebz costs an astronomical $14 per day (s'why you didn't see me yelping last Saturday thru Tuesday!)  The bathroom was THE ooh-la-la!  The large, warmly-lit room is flanked by two sinks/counters and two large mirrors.  At the center-back of the room is roomy bath/spa.  To the left, a closet for the throne.  To the right, the plate glass-doored spacious shower... with a bench.  (mmmm, secksy!)  -The Pools- The sixth floor.  The wide open space of the sixth floor rooftop is a little desolate on first impression.  Most of the immediate area is occupied by rows and rows of beach chairs.  The two pools at either side of the roof aren't anything particularly cutting edge, but it is where all the sun-bathing beauts are.  (yummm, hotness!)  -Casino- The gaming floor at PH is not as much of a spectacle as those of other casinos.  Because of PH's dark color scheme (black and pink?) and the centrally located structure of Heart Bar, the expanse of the floor is broken up and somewhat less cacophonous.  The Pleasure Pit is awesome, a set of card/game tables dealt by scantily clad women as well as entertained by scantily clad dancers prancing about on nearby stages...  How could you not dig that...?  Makes it a little hard to concentrate though...  The Poker Room is one of the nicer Hold'Em rooms on the strip, IMO, since it is not totally secluded; I can sit at the nearby Extra Lounge and watch my homegirl charm and victimize other players into bad beats and dumb calls.  Heh, suckas! _______________________________________________ Cards, drinks, and *bootybootybootybooty-rockin-e'rywhere*!!

...based on the "late night" menu... 4 in the morning is technically early morn, yeah?  ...nevermind...  This place, even in the middle of the night, tries to have a far reaching menu but fails to deliver on the quality of said items... and they are relatively overpriced to boot!  There are easily three or four dozen televisions in the establishment running what seems to be an attention-deficit friendly tirade of Extra and Sports Center in every direction.  The decor and furnishings are actually somewhat stylish by comparison of the rest of Planet Hollywood's contrast-happy black, pink, chrome, and frosted glass.  Sadly, the "late night" menu stumbles in its hopes to offer anything substantial or memorable (or pleasantly memorable, anyhow).  There was the gummy/chewy calamari that came to the table in an abundant, but lukewarm oily pile.  The lettuce wraps, wherein the chicken/peanuts/water-chestnut mix was so homogenous, it was scary.  The fried chicken and waffle with the overcooked flavorless dry chicken "breast" patty sitting unceremoniously atop an unremarkable waffle (okay, the honey-butter was okay...!)  And the pepper'd pepper chicken that was so peppering pepper'd that all you could pepper was the pepper.  Plus one star for the service, Molly, I believe her name was; she was excellent in her attention and could tell we weren't enjoying the food much.  But she was sweet, its too bad she has to fight such an uphill battle serving this stuff.  Note:  I've heard from friends that they get it right during the daytime and early eve.  I'll see for myself sometime...

2 stars...  El-ay-ex or "lacks"? ...lacks...  After the forty-some-odd minute ordeal of waiting in the one of the most disorganized VIP herds (... yes, "herd", there was NO semblance of a line there, whatsoever), finally getting into LAX is underwhelming.  The interior design of the club is rather non-descript (if a little boring); black walls, black floors, black bartops, a rafter of candles over the DJ booth, a large projected "LAX" spanning half the height of the room...  Book-end'd by bars, the first floor simply a long floorspace, with VIP/bottleservice booths along one length (under the second floor balconys) and two tiers of VIP booths running along the other length (bi-sected by the DJ booth).  The actual dancing space for non-VIPs is a roped-off area down the center of the room (maybe MAYBE 30' wide by 100-or-so' long).  Upstairs, accessible by ballroom-esque stairs on either side of the room, four (or six?) VIP rooms overlooking the first floor run the length of one side of the room, opposite the DJ.  A large nonVIP balcony (the best spot in the club) provides a great vantage point and also remains roomy enough for people who actually like to dance rather than move side-to-side in cramped quarters.  I recall one bar upstairs (crowded as all get-out!), but there may have been one at the other end as well.  The music was a mixed bag... DJ Vice(?) out of Southern California does a eclectic set of music, playing everything from radio grade hip-hop to house to throwback mash-ups, visiting every genre a little too often.  I was seldom in a groove that lasted more than a two or three songs before my interest would lull.  The vibe here just doesn't... vibe.  People don't seem to be mingling or flirting or venturing in the least.  LAX wouldn't be my first choice for clubbing in Vegas...  Unless you are getitng the VIP/Bottle Service treatment, anyone else is kind of neglected and herd'd together...  Note: the dresscode actually seemed kind of lax, most guys getting in wearing denim, a few hats, even saw a pair of plain Van slip-ons.  Button or collar'd shirts all around though.

Cantina/Restaurant: 3 Stars... Amber... Amber... :    5 Stars...!  ...the smokin hot gorgeous bartender with the body of a goddess, face of an angel, eyes like a cat, fiery tongued, winked flirtatiously, smiled sweetly, was sexy-knew-it-but-didn't-overdo-it, who fired back one liners with so much attitude and playfulness that she hooked every man/sucka in the place?... her name was Amber.  Her name was Amber.  (... full review coming soon...)

Solid 4 stars...!    Beer, unassumingly sold from a sleek little shop in the middle of the [Miracle Mile] mall.... Ahhhhh, only in Vegas!  And there we were.  E, K, and I traipsing about in the Miracle Mile Shopping Center during the Grand Opening weekend of Planet Hollywood, Las Vegas.  Was it presumptuous to assume that we might refrain for the morning from drinking on this second day of a Vegas junket, after a bender of a first night?  Of course it was... =)  Alas, the shimmering chrome and fetching red-n-black silhouette of woman (their logo) drew us in... SIN CITY BREWING CO.!!  Our two pints of Weisse were affordable (@ $4.50 a pint) and very refreshingly good.  They also offer an Light, an Amber, and a Stout... all of which I have the utmost faith in the quality and taste of...  Why the faith in beers I didn't get to try?   Returning the next day to pick up some [skimpy/sexy] tank tops for my girl-friends, I got to meet The Man himself, brew-master Richard Johnson.  "So, where from...?" he asked. "San Jose, CA", I reply. "Me too, that's where my first brewpub was..." he says, beaming.  "Gordon Biersch." "Oh, wow!  Nice to meet you, sir, I go there all the time", I espouse, stunned.  Richard Johnson... Gordon Biersch Director of Brewing Operations, Richard Johnson.   Yes, THAT Richard Johnson...  All in all, a fun little place away from the hustle of the casino floors.  Where good brews are sold as nonchalantly as soda or water... I heart Vegas!  (Plus 1-star for the experience of meeting THE brew-master...!)

Choice...  It's what Vegas is all about, it seems, and Pour24 is situated right at the crossroads offering choice of scenery, choice of beer, and the choice to just slow down and chill out...  The location is prime for people watching as foot traffic converges from all sides - the MGM walkway, the Excalibur walkway, NYNY casino floor escalator. With no walls & no booths, if you can see them, they can see you... A few yards away, the oft hilarious spectacle of d-baggery plays out at Coyote Ugly. And if hunger strikes, Nathan's Hot Dogs is a short stumbling walk away.  More importantly, Pour24 offers the widest selection of beer on tap that I've seen along most of the strip AND doesn't break your wallet in the process. I'll take their $6/$7 pints of craftbeer anyday over the exorbitantly marked up bottled beers on the casino floor bars. Hmmm, 24 taps and a wide array versus four or five common bottles...?  And service? The bartenders at Pour24 have been some of the friendlier bar staff I've encountered in Vegas! Attentive, eager to make recommendations, doling out tasting pours and quick-witted conversation; these guys seem to like what they do.  Anytime I go to Vegas, especially if I'm staying at NYNY, Pour24 is on my "must do" list. ________________________ No rush. No hype. No pretense.  Just beer, beer, people watch, and beer. That's a stacked deck in my favor. Choice made easy. I'll be back.

This is a resort-caliber timeshare facility, missing a couple of luxuries that would definitely push it into 5-star territory.  The newness of the construction is evident as everything is relatively modern.  The two-bedroom unit that I have stayed in here previously was spacious and en vogue, if safely designed.  Again, the accessibility to a full kitchen, washer/dryer, dining table, etc etc. quickly gives the sense of homey comfort.  Having a balcony/terrace overlooking the pool is just awesome...  The resort has amenities a plenty, offering 4 pools (a lazy river, two pools, a grotto), a rec room (of video games, table tennis, billiards), a fitness room, a couple of poolside cabanas, and BBQ grills.  There is shuttle service to the strip that only runs to a too-early-for-Vegas time.  The big minus stars for this timeshare resort?  One, they could have benefited from having even a perfunctory food/craft service on site.  And two (this is kind of the big "too bad"), the resort is located a distant 4-ish miles from the Strip (Mandalay Bay being closest).  Cabbing that distance could quickly eat away at your fun money... ____________________________ Timeshare patrons arent' always couples and families.  Nope, sometimes its 12 college age women celebrating their bachelorette friend's last hurrah... *teehee*  FUN!

OH, 4.5 SECKSY STARS!!  Very possibly one of the best poolside chill-out spots on the strip!  Just hawtness and cocoa butter ev-er-y-where!  The cost of admission is, of course, being a guest at Mandalay Bay; thankfully, with the IPC Tech conference in town/@Mandalay for the week, MN and SE were put up here for work.  As you pass through the amusement park-like turn-styles where they electronically check your room-key for validity, and once you collect a towel or two from an attendant, the area opens up into a spanning horizon of endless tanned and toned bodies.  Shyness is not an option, apparently.  (Actually, there is a fair amount of porcelain-skinned and not-so-fits *raises hand*, but the grrrrrr-yummies definitely draw your attention!)  The centerpiece of the scene is the wave pool, technologically producing modest swells that crash down with a soothing and familiar sound as sunbathers lay out on the beach-chairs or on towels sprawled out on the sand.  Yes, sand.  A course grained sand that actually brushes off fairly easily and, barring any *teeheehee*-playfulness, shouldn't easily find its way into places you'd rather not have it...   Along the perimeter, there are at least 4 other aquatic attractions - a lazy river and 3 other pools.  Two of those smaller pools seemed very much patronized by the familial types; couples/grand-couples with children, etc. Also to be found along the edges of the beach are a series of luxurious cabanas outfitted with televisions and whatnot, all of which must come at some astronomical premium, I'm sure.  Food and beverages are available via a large outdoor bar and adjacent concession stand, as well as upper-scale restaurants/bars that overlook the beach.   - Via the Bikini Bar, we ordered three (3) mojitos and a bucket-o-coronas (5, canned).  The exorbitant-but-not-unexpected price?  Sixty-eight dollars. - Along those same lines, but far more satisfying were the $10 half-pound Kobe Cheeseburgers available from the snack stand. - Cocktail service is also available on the beach, via waitresses (a la Baywatch, but with drink-trays instead of life-preservers).  So, do an extra workout, eschew carbs a bit to get them abs tight, rock your dopest poolside gear and bring yo'secksy-selves to Mandalay Beach...   (... but get there friggin' early and bring a credit card!) _________________________________ ... the powder blue bikini she wore flattered her fit form as she slinked cat-like across the sand towards a towel.  She lifted her stunna-shades, light brown eyes atwinkle in the high sun... "Hi... I'm Marissa." "Hi... Mikey."

Confections? Check. Ice Cream? Check. Coffee drinks? Check. Baked goods? Check. Candy coated coffee flavored ice cream stuffed baked goods...?  Well, yeah.  Check!  We'd actually eaten our Z Pizza slices from next door/room at a table in the Pink Spot's space, mostly because the tables are much bigger and little Claire was elated and engaged with playing some of the board games available therein. (Mind you, her rules for checkers equated to "I win, Mikey loses", but I played anyhow, having not seen her in such a long time.)  After our pizza dinner, as we sat there catching up on Yelpiness, SBCness, Bay Area-ness, Lynn and I sipped away at Pumpkin Spice Lattes while Claire enjoyed a scoop of Cotton Candy Ice Cream...  Its a cute place and a sweet-tooth's playland. Just as well, the place is perfectly suited for collegiate or studious crowd with bright lights, comfortable lounge chairs, roomy tables, and open wi-fi.  Plus, if the mountainous availability of sugar and caffeine doesn't do it for you, there's a pizza joint attached next door.  If there were a wicked witch hiding in the back, awaiting an unwitting Hansel and Gretel, I woudn't be surprised; the stock and wares venture in almost every sweet direction, not specializing or capitalizing on any one sugary thing. Before leaving, I picked up a few things for dear Lynn and Claire as well as my gracious hosts back at the apartment.  Ice Cream Cookie Sandwiches.   Frozen Chocolate Dipped Cheesecakes.   Pints of Coffee Ice Cream.  Oh my oh my oh my! _________________________________ They had "The Pink Spot" tees, tanks, and trucker hats. Almost bought something for the bestie, but opted not to. She said she would have gotten a kick out of it. Next time...
