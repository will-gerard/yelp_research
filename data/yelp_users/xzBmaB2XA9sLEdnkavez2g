Wash was good, but more expensive than what I normally would have paid. The only reason I got one and didn't do it on my own was because I was promised by one of their team that I would get a free wash if it rained and I brought it back within 48 hours of when I got it washed. Even after I told him that my car could only be hand washed because of the soft top. I bring it in two days after a monsoon and am told the offer is only good for a basic machine wash. And when the representative went to 'see what he could do for me' and came back with a regular 'Happy hour' discount, all I could do was laugh.  The wash was excellent. I love how my car looked for a day. But I do NOT appreciate being lied to so some kid could meet his commission quota and I don't appreciate being treated like an idiot when being offered 'let me see what I can do for you.' This joint prides themselves on their customer service... Maybe send out a memo that most customers appreciate honesty

I came in at 1:30PM this morning. I was craving a hookah and this is the only place that is open this early. Previous experiences should have deterred me from coming, but in my naivety, I figured I could give them another chance. "Maybe I'm just dramatizing previous experiences. Maybe it's not as bad as I thought."  It is now about an hour after my arrival and I find myself at Pita Jungle. If you look on google maps, that's about a half hour away. I left after about half an hour of no acknowledgement. By server or by the owner. You would think the owner would care enough to give half a damn about his investment...but I can only imagine this fine gentleman bought this business as a means to free food and hookah. Because he for damn sure does not run this establishment like a business.   There were two servers that I saw in the half hour I was waiting. One was actually doing work, and the other was sitting with the owner of the business and they both were sitting in the back smoking. I gave the one server the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe he just didn't see me. Fast forward about 15 minutes after I got there...we made eye contact and I didn't get so much as an acknowledgement. The vibe I got was that this employee didn't care too much about his job. As all employees have previously shown. This was explained in the next couple of minutes, when the owner of the establishment walked past me, saw me, and did the same as his employee. Didn't acknowledge that there was a potentially paying customer, and didn't even bother to send a server out to assist me. About 20 minutes after that happened, I left. I was bound to have better luck 20 minutes away in an establishment that actually cares to keep their business afloat.  I've had multiple experiences at this place. If you asked me from years ago, I would have told you this place is nice. Service is good and hookah is good as well. I don't know what happened in that time, but it is literally the worst experience I have had in any type of establishment. This is counting my run ins with the TSA. They had more common courtesy than this place does. Take a minute to digest what I just said. And I say it with complete honesty. If the owner of this business cares at all about this investment of his, there are serious changes that need to be made.   I urge any employees that care about where you work, and the work that you do. Please, sign this place up for Kitchen Nightmares. I can't imagine a better establishment for the services of Gordon Ramsey. Until then, I'm never coming back again. And the next time I think I'm exaggerating to myself as to how bad this place is, I will remember that I took the opportunity to create a Yelp account and wrote this gigantic review, just because of how awful this service is.   Now if you excuse me, the shawarma that I got at Pita Jungle has just arrived. Faster service than I have ever had at Pita House...by a long shot.

I am very much a fan of this place. One of my two favorite hookah joints, because the service is excellent, the hookah is great and the food is good as well. I haven't had much experience with the menu but what I have had was delicious.

Hands down, George at AYD is the most professional and detail oriented detailer that I've ever gotten to do business with. I brought my car in the day after some punk spray painted the hood because I was told that I may be able to get it buffed out. I sent pictures to George to see what he thought of the situation. I really didn't expect much could be done at this point except to paint the hood, but I figured getting a consultation wouldn't hurt. After reviewing the pictures I sent, he told me that he couldn't guarantee anything, but he would do his best to see what he could do. I brought it over, and after about a half hour, you couldn't tell that there had ever been anything wrong with it.   I'm the type of person who cares more about his car than most people he knows, so I hope that speaks to the quality I demand from anyone that touches my car. I don't exaggerate when I say that I was left speechless when I saw the work he had done. It came out immaculate, and on top of that, he saved me a lot of money that I was ready to dish out on paint.   George has built a lifelong customer with me, and I will not go to anyone but him for any of my detailing needs. He knows his stuff, and his work shows it. I proudly give AYD my full endorsement.
