I've done every prime steakhouse in the Valley (Morton's, Donovan's, Mastro's, etc) ordering the same cut each time ... Boneless ribeye, medium rare. Flemings won hands down. Service is impeccable and when you are a regular, you are remembered and treated accordingly. My favorite restaurant.

I've been eating at Los Dos since they had the little restaurant on Main and Alma School. There is no better New Mexican style anywhere. My favorite, especially when I have a cold (or it IS cold), is the green chile stew. Un-believ-ably good. Enjoy!

I've been a customer for over 13 years. They have always been very professional and the price is always fair. I'm able to request the same technician each time which builds a relationship. Samuel #14 is the best. Love this company!

My brother also posted about our Mother's Day experience. These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely. This is the second and last time we will frequent this location. The pizza and calzones were awful.

Easy as always. Kyle Welter and everyone in the service department made it simple and fast.

Dr. Reyes has been my dentist since the first day she opened her practice. I followed her from a previous office where she was briefly. What a difference! She's absolutely the best. I recommend her highly. As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) and college professor, I'd like to think that I know a little about how a a professional has to care about their patients. Dr. Reyes and her staff are wonderful. Thanks Doc!
