Get the honey habanero sauce with your chicken. Free, good mix of spicy and sweet and probably the best sauce for chicken ever.

I had the Chili Colorado and wow it was great!  I eat a lot of tex-mex so I wanted something different.  Beef in a stew with jalapeños, beans and rice. It came with flour tortillas.  Very tasty.  The beef was very tender and perfect.  Their beans and rice have a lot of flavor too.  The service is always very attentive and liberal with the free warm chips, salsa & warm bean dip... mmm.  The ambiance is typical tex-mex with Spanish themed items on the walls and bright colors.  This location is a bit cozy, but it has a nice feel.  I came in with a party of 10 and they were able to seat us quickly, our food came out quicker than expected and everyone enjoyed their meal.  Plus they recently updated their menu to include pictures of ALL entries. Not everyone's thing but I appreciate it and so will your family.  Grab a couple chocolate-mint candies as you leave.

Octane has a decent sized track with helpful workers and keep the experience fun.  There is a big outdoor section for those who want to watch and play yard games.  Prices are a bit high in my opinion, but I don't frequent kart tracks. Good place, won't come back if I have to pay full price.

Everything we had was great. Unexpected pineapple in salsa verde, papas, enchiladas and steak chimichanga will definitely have us going back.

I had the chicken fingers which includes 5 large pieces and a large amount of fries which seem to be made there. Plus a side of ranch.  Chicken fingers were ok, obviously from a bag. Fries have the skin left on and are tasty.

I ordered a barbecue chicken pizza add bacon, it was terrific and ready to pick up in 15 minutes on a Friday night. The pizza had a pan crust which isn't as heavy or greasy as Pizza Hut's.  Keep an eye out for online & app deals, through this weekend pizzas are 50% off.

I have to admit that the primary reason I come to Stayshons is for the Coca Cola Freestyle machine. $1 for 32 oz, $1.50 for 44 oz and refills are under a dollar.  The pumps and register get busy, but everything moves quickly. The employees are friendly. I had my windshield replaced at my work by their mobile service at no cost (via auto insurance). I had a lot of chips with a few small cracks, they approached me at a pump. It went well and I have had no issues.  Great place!

As far as salad bar buffets go, Sweet Tomatoes is king and this location's buffet is good enough. It's hard to get wowed by a salad bar buffet, but besides the age-showing decor and hit or miss service, this location works.  The food is usually fresh and items are almost always available. If they bring in a Coke Freestyle like they have at another location it would be great.  I love the chili.

This Safeway has a good sandwich and hot deli as well and tasty bakery.  If you frequent Safeway, the app with coupons you can load are a must. Great deals and you can often get things up to $2 off.  This location is always clean, the staff is friendly and the produce section is usually good. Sometimes the bread and salad selection badly needs to be restocked.

I buy more electronics here than I do other places. Don't tell anyone but since they carry electronics and video game accessories that no one goes to Fry's to purchase they always have a good selection of discounted items. New Wii U pro controller for $25 instead of $50, Wii knunchuck for $10 instead of $20 which are never discounted at other places. Great flip style waffle maker for $10. Awesome deals!

I recieved a coupon for a buy one get one coupon for a large pizza. I was excited because I love their BBQ pizza.  We noticed as we arrived that they advertised BOGO pizza on Sunday.  We went and ordered two pizzas ($11.99 each) and presented the email which I received Friday that mentioned "this weekend only" BOGO pizza "through 2/1/2015".  I read this as valid through Sunday.  Unfortunately I was told only Sunday.  I felt that the coupon would be more clear instead of "this weekend" or "through 2/1/15" like "only valid 2/1/15" would be better if this was the case.  Either the staff was wrong or the coupon was poorly worded in multiple sentences.  At any rate, unfortunately as I love their food and Coca Cola Freestyle, this location (and probably promo emails) just can't be trusted to do the right thing.  They were not willing to give the promo so we walked out.  I would think customer service would be more important than sticking to their misunderstanding of the promo. Won't be back to this location again and will think twice about using their email promotions. Shame.

I have never had a bad meal here.  I used to just get chicken fingers and burgers and although they are good, they get boring.  So I started reaching out to the tex-mex items and wow they're good!  I have had the short rib enchiladas, BBQ chicken enchiladas and crispy chicken tacos and they have always been flavorful and hot.  Very surprised they came from a chain restaurant. Their crispy tacos are seasoned with taco seasoning which adds a good flavor.  Sometimes the wait staff forgets something or makes a mistake but they always correct it quickly.  Sign up for Chili's emails for bi-weekly coupons for free appetizers, fajita upgrade & free kids meals.

Very friendly staff, clean office, prompt service and modern equipment. I was referred to Riviera and I have never regretted changing eye doctors.  As a type 1 diabetic I have to treat my eyes with more care and attention than most and they are very knowledgable and friendly.  They are patient, listen and give good advise.  I get pictures of my eyes taken which are very cool and makes sure there isn't anything I need to be concerned about. They have a good selection of frames too.  I also enjoy getting appointment confirmation emails instead of calls. Great place!

I had trouble with my battery and had a good idea that I needed another one. I came here, someone tested the battery, I bought a new one and they installed the new one for free.  The check and installation as I said was complementary. Friendly service and no pressure sales will have me coming back.

Great food, fast and friendly service, but a little pricey. I love tex-mex and I typically get a ground beef chimi plus chips & queso when I go to a new restaurant.  They were both spot on here. I asked for ground beef, but I go shredded however it was very tasty and super quick so I didn't care much. Chips & queso were $7.50 which seems a bit steep for cheese and more of the free chips. We added the table hot salsa and it was even more terrific and spicy.  The waitress was very nice although she did disappear for about 20 minutes when we needed refills and more chips.  We'll be back.

Prices and happy hour special were changed, more expensive and doesn't meet our schedules.  Really too bad, we really enjoyed coming but we will need to find a new go to. Liked checking out other locations too.  Won't be back to any.

I don't have high expectations when it comes to Zipps, however even for a sports bar this place is kinda gross.  We used to come to Zipps a lot due to good happy hour prices, they have since raised the prices and now it's very difficult to recommend a place that looks the other way in many regards AND isn't very cheap.  First, it's probably not a bad idea to wash your hands after handling a menu anywhere, but wow their menus are dirty. The last two times I have been here my hands were sticky after touching them. Including the last time where I tried hard to only touch it with one finger. The table was only slightly cleaner.  Then the most egregious part of our visit, the tacos. I'll preface with saying that I am far from a taco snob. I enjoy anything from Taco Bell, Del Taco, Salty Señorita, etc. Wow, Zipps has the worst tacos I have ever eaten. You get four tacos, seasoned beef or chicken. I got 2 each.  The chicken and beef meats look almost identical and basically taste the same.  I should have taken a picture. Both are soupy messes that taste like what I imagine what dog food taste like. I hated typing those words because it sounds mean and sensationalizing, but it's true. The corn tortillas buckled under the load of the soupy, gross mixture that tasted like it's been sitting in a soup container waiting to be delivered to a poor unfortunate soul.  The tacos come with sour cream (which I luckily got on the side) and diced tomatoes which added to the mushy mess.  There was no cheese, lettuce or anything else on the tacos. But I did find large pieces of lettuce UNDER the tacos in the basket. Likely from a salad mix.  Luckily we got sweet potato chips which did offer texture and a pleasant taste.

Took the girlfriend on Valentine's Day after making a reservation on Open Table. When we arrived they set a table and showed us to our table outside. It was a great night so it was comfortable, but the overhead lights being so bright it took away from the ambiance.  They had specials for the night and their normal menu. One entree was sold out, rigatoni with bolognese which is probably what I would have ordered so I go spaghetti with meatballs. I am not by any means a pasta connoisseur, but this was the best spaghetti and meatballs I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, very tasty and well seasoned sauce and awesome meatballs.  Someone came by and offered rolls, they were tasty however dry without anything else. Girlfriend's was a bit burnt. Prices overall are little higher than I would expect.  We'll be back, I look forward to trying the chicken parm.

I order using the website which is very easy and you can customize your order. I would like to add comments to make my order extra-extra spicy though.  This location has a separate area for order pick up and my orders are always available on time.  Chopsticks, utensils & soy sauce is offered for your bag.

I drove a bit out of my way to come to this Jiffy Lube with five stars. I was not disappointed.  When you go to Jiffy Lube you can always expect the following: get out of your car, sit in the waiting area, get called to review the maintenance you want then wait for it to be completed. Then because of jiffy in the name, it's expected to be fast.  This location meets expectations and the service guys are friendly and courteous.  I was greeted by the manager, he also cashed me out. Another guy reviewed my service options without any hard selling.  I like getting all of my fluids checked when I get an oil change, one less thing for me to worry about.  I also appreciate being in and out under 30 minutes and still getting friendly service. I would come back here.  Be sure to always check Jiffy Lube of Arizona's website for coupons. They always have at least $5 off.

Booked the hotel on a summer Saturday night on a $50 deal. Great price for a stay-cation.  Apparently there is valet available, there are door greeters, hourly 24 hr Cave Creek shuttle and the lobby smells like elusive cookies, good first impression.  Everyone is super nice, definitely a resort feel.  The desk attendant even had a bag of ice delivered to me from the restaurant on the spot, then he told me where the ice machines are.  They have a cool (desert) botanical garden to walk through in the courtyard. We didn't try the saloon or restaurant, but the restaurant was busy.  The room was clean and had a large (for a hotel room) mud room. Hmm. Everything was modern and comfy.  Nice place, I would stay again.

Found a great deal on Kayak / Travelocity - $160 for Saturday night when every other site had it for $199 - $235, other comparable places started at $240. So this is the biggest selling point for me, the *relatively* cheap price compared to other casinos on the strip with similar rating and amenities.  The last time I stayed for 3 nights at $48 per night.  However this time I assumed that because it was a Saturday night and other places were expensive or sold out I was just paying a premium.  No. Hot tub in the room, huge bathroom and another room with its own window and total of two flat screen tv's, there's was a mini fridge too.  No wifi to be found even though you pay a $20 resort fee.  We didn't even turn on the tv however as we only used the room to sleep and use the bathroom. Oh well, great stay!

I haven't tried much here but what I get is so good I don't have to stray. I always get the jerk fried rice and jade red chicken.  The jerk fried rice has junks of jerk chicken, very tasty. The jade red chicken is always terrific.  The free snicker doodle cookie is great too.

I have always loved Qdoba because of their variety, quality and taste and although those haven't changed, their menu and service seem to vary.  I definitely recommend the craft 2 if you want to get two smaller entrees, it's a great deal.  Two tacos with chips ("on the side") and choice of queso and add in *anything* for under $10.  Awesome. Including the price of sour cream in entrees is a bit frustrating as I don't care for them, but this probably is a benefit for most.  My meal was very tasty; I love the salsa roja (spicy) and the flavor of he meat. You always see meat being grilled.  Great place. More locations needed.

I had a late night hunger for frozen yogurt at 10:30 PM and after looking for open places, I decided upon The Gelato Spot. Sure, it's not frozen yogurt... it's much better.  There was a big selection of interesting, delicious sounding flavors; I decided upon the almond Snickers.  My gelato was awesome. The texture was creamy and there was chocolate and caramel swirls with chocolate and almond pieces.  I love Snickers and although it did not remind me of a Snickers bar, it had great flavors and I had no complaints.  I also enjoyed the pirouette, it added a good crunch to the dessert.  Great place, super tasty, eat with their little spoon, and savor the flavors... it's a little on the pricey side (in my opinion). But, this may be the going rate for quality gelato.

Great salad bar with the option to self pay. They probably lose money with hungry salad bar patrons and the quality of items they have available. Cajun mix, hummus, fruit salad are some of the notable items.  I always get the salad bar, but I also like getting the excellent southwest chicken chili. The club is great too!  Never had anything I didn't love here.

I love the kung pow chicken and my last visit this week did not disappoint. I ask for extra-extra spicy with extra peanuts with fried rice (splurging as I rarely eat rice).  My entree was fresh and very hot and as spicy as I wanted. The combination of spicy, peanuts and the wok-seared chicken is amazing. I love the snap peas and carrots too.  The rice was fresh and tasty as well.  Coke Freestyle and Apple Pay, hooray!  I couldn't ask for more, and if you have an Amex card, there is deal (until 2/2016) too!

I enjoy Nike shoes because they stay together for me for about a year or two,  they are comfortable and typically easy to clean. I come to the Nike outlet store to save at least $30 - $40.  They have a good selection in many sizes, their employees are very helpful when asking for sizes, they will help you look for things and also provide bags.  The last pair of shoes I bought said $70, down from $90 MSRP.  They rang up with an apparent sale plus 20% on guys shoes. Perfect. Just over $30.  Great place to guy cheap, quality shoes.  Also, being your patience. Almost everyonethat comes here brings at least two kids.  The fun really starts when they start playing with the mini basketballs.  Once you get through the people and kids, this is a great store and place to buy shoes.

As far as Big Lot locations go, this one is probably the best.  Well organized, not ravaged like other discount stores, clean, friendly service and lots of post-holiday sale items.  Come for the cheaper name brand out of season items or discontinued items.  Very happy about the cool The Simpsons kids cat toys I found here.

I purchased a battery with a three year warranty at another location a year ago and it started giving me trouble and the car wouldn't start.  I got a jump start and came to this location as it is the closest (15 minutes) location from my home.  I explained that I have a battery warranty and after they looked up my purchase they went to check the battery. They saw that there was a small leak and immediately started replacing it for free. He worked quickly and was very friendly.  Great customer service.

I had high expectations when I came to Joe's Farm Grill; from the filming of Diners, Drive In & Dives, the near flawless Yelp reviews, recent Fox 10 morning live shoot and the very modern and clean restaurant. I was not disappointed.  When I was looking at the menu while in line out the door I could not decide what to get, everything sounded great. However I chose the BBQ sampler which came with enough BBQ pork to make a big sandwich, two large chicken fingers smothered in BBQ sauce, ribs and coleslaw.  Even with high expectations I was very surprised.  The BBQ pork was very flavorful and juicy, the smothered chicken tenders were still crisp yet smothered in sauce and the chicken was very tender and even the coleslaw was awesome. Small pieces of cabbage and carrot so it's not unwieldy which came in a tasty slightly peppery sauce.  I was stuffed at this point so I took the ribs home. They look great and I look foreword to eating them for lunch today.  I also ordered a pecan caramel shake which is a current special with roasted pecans and homemade caramel sauce, it was top notch as well.  I tried a sip of the chocolate espresso shake which had bits of espresso beans, wow.  This place lives up to the hype and then some.  I love the hand washing station so you can easily wash up before and after as well as the condiment dispensers including what I assume is homemade BBQ sauce. You can also get huge cups of free homemade ranch to go with your meal from the counter.  Don't let a line at the counter deter you from getting a meal at this awesome restaurant. Enjoy the scenery out back and take a walk around agritopia afterwards.  Awesome place!

I am not by any means a cupcake connoisseur, however Sprinkles has the best cupcakes I have ever tried. Fresh and tasty and the service is always friendly.

This review is for the cupcake ATM.  You know when it's late, Christmas Eve and there is a hole in you that can only be filled by a cupcake?  Sprinkles is there for you with the 24 hour automated cupcake dispenser.  Order using a touch screen then watch your cupcake(s) exit via the camera. Easy, fast, tasty and good quality cupcakes anytime you want.  Over $9 for two and although there is a good selection of types (low fat, low sugar, etc) I wish there were more interesting and seasonal flavors. More citrus and fruit flavor would be great.

I have been coming to Los Reyes de la Torta for a couple of years with my coworkers for lunch and I have enjoyed every meal.  Their menu is huge with many different variations of burritos, quesadillas, tacos and much more.  I typically get a burrito that comes with steak, jalapeños, beans, onions and I ask for no avocado or cilantro. They have always been flavorful, hot, fresh and a bit spicy.  My co-workers get the quesadillas, other burritos and taco and they have always enjoyed their food.  They are always on point with flavor, consistency, service and even during lunch you can find a table or two.  I look forward to next time.

Went here for the first time on a Sunday (all-day happy hour). The prices seem reasonable, however on happy hour the appetizers (& drinks) are 1/2 price. Awesome deals. Vegetable & chicken goyza very tasty and the chicken wings were great.  Great happy hour deals and everyone knows it, busy even on a Sunday night.

So others would probably call me a Target addict and if that is the case, this location enables me.  First, I live less than five minutes away so the location is very convenient.  Second, the SAVING. Yes I capitalized saving, but you can clean up here if you have coupons, price match, items are on sale, use the Cartwheel or ALL of the above. For example: $18.99 for newest X-Men movie on blu-ray, price match with Amazon to $9.99 then 10% off that for movies & music that week with the Cartwheel app = $8.98. Awesome.  Or use manufacturers coupons (print from web or newspaper), sale cartwheel & $5 gift card with purchase to stock up.  A year's worth of body wash and deodorant for 1/3 of the price. Sometimes they even have Cartwheel discounts up to 50% off, just by showing your phone.  This location also has great service. The cashiers are always friendly even though I have never seen them before and they are probably just seasonal. The first two lanes are the customer service lanes too and every once and a while when I do price match or return something they are always very nice.  Finally, the store itself is clean and organized. No overflowing trash or other unsightly stuff here. There are plenty of price check scanners too.  If this location was a SuperTarget it would be perfect, until then this is a awesome location with groceries.

The food is delicious from the sandwiches, salads, soups and baked goods I have never had something I didn't enjoy. Great selection of unsweetened ice teas too.  Paradise Bakery gets four stars for the food, but loses a star for the price and ordering system.  Today I got a whole classic salad add chicken and a large drink, it was over $12. It was delicious in spite of the southwest chicken salad being removed from the menu resulting in roasted corn & peppers not being available (argh).  As for the ordering system, they really need to figure out how to remove the inevitable first timer confusion and worker needing to explain repeatedly where to order what from.  There is typically a line greeting you when you come anytime around lunch. Today I took food to go and it took 17 minutes.

Ruby Tuesday is a solid American fare restaurant where you can get a meal that plays it safe typically under $10; get the salad bar.  Yes this is a chain restaurant that your parents & grandparents would probably enjoy, however their service is typically good, you can almost always get coupons via email and their salad bar is consistently good and well kept.  The salad bar is probably the differentiator for RT, many entrees come with it, $2.99 add on if not, but if you want just the salad bar, get an entree that comes with it like the Baja chicken tacos for just a couple dollars more.  Spring mix & iceburg lettuces, fresh broccoli / bacon salad, fruit salad, potato salad and fresh croutons are a few highlights.  Ruby Tuesday seemed to simplify their menu and slowly move to more bar fare with their addition of new chicken fingers and removal of spaghetti squash and zucchini minis (now I have to make them at home).  Don't expect to be blown away, but have a solid meal with a salad bar if you're up for it.

I came in at 8:30 PM tonight to pickup a veggie patty sammich.  A guy in a black polo was walking around talking to another guy in a booth. As I walked up, the guy in he polo must have noticed me and went across the room to start mopping.  I walked up to the counter and ordered.  I was asked if I wanted it toasted... yes. I'm still not sure why the veggie patty was microwaved for about 50 seconds prior to being toasted. I've never seen cheese hiss and pop out of the oven like that at Subway.  While I was at the counter I looked at the guy in the booth and he had a napkin sticking out of one of his nostrils.  The worker mopping was talking to him and napkin-nose was spouting ignorance about being sick, going to the hospital, AIDS, whatever.  While napkin-nose was talking the sandwich artist had the "shut the f--- up dude, I've got a customer" look. I've definitely been there before.  The late shift guys need to tell their pals to act normal or wait in the car. Also, they need to check their veggie patty reheating game.

Awesome banana bread french toast, no need for syrup. Tip: get a savory side like turkey sausage to balance out the sweet. Gf is picky about her eggs, and our waitress saw that she didn't eat them and they asked to take them off the check. Great customer service.

This review is for the nachos. Wow they are salty and terrible.  The poor cook painstakingly put meat, tomatoes and cheese on individual chips and put them under the broiler. Their hard work was wasted as I just wanted chips with toppings piled on with cheese all over the place.  Plus it was incredibly salty.

Jason's Deli is a place where you a great sandwich, soup, potato with a surprisingly good salad bar.  Their salad bar has never disappointed with a lot of items, many that you only see at an exceptional buffet.  Potato salad, corn salsa, banana pudding, spicy nut mix are a few of the unexpected tasty items.  So I always get the salad when I come, but today I usually get soup and today I got the chili. I accepted the offer to add onions.  The chili is chili con carne and was terrific.  I have never had a bad meal here. Today the free ice cream machine wasn't working unfortunately.

This store destroyed the stellar 8 year customer service streak with Apple.  From mentioning multiple times you can reserve phones on launch day in line to eventually being told they don't do reservations, calling and being told I would be called back then eventually having phones setup not being asked which line is for which phone and of course they are setup wrong.  Big iPhone launch day shenanigans, avoid Apple Store on launch day and for weeks afterward. They seemingly hire hipster temp employees whose job is to be a hipster, make you happy aka buying mood and get you out the door.

We had a great time as we came early in the day and only had to wait in short lines for the first few hours.  There are numerous water slides to choose from including ones to slide down on a mat, 4-person raft, many traditional, and multiple on a (no charge) inflatable tube. The lines do not move as fast as you would expect with slides that allow 3-6 people at a time.  The slides themselves are awesome and offer a good variety.  Other reviews talk about multiple down rides, only the yellow half pipe slide was down and it looked like it was down for at least a few weeks.  We really enjoyed the lazy river which was long and had many different features. It gets a bit congested as the day goes on. They tell you that you must be in an tube.  The wave pool was very underwhelming. I have been in a few other wave pools where the deep end is a bit of a challenge. Boring here.  The lockers were great with a kiosk to pay for lockers with a card then wristbands are printed to access. Just go up to a bank of lockers and scan your barcode and an available one opens. Then come back all day and scan to get back in. Very easy.  Due to the amount of people that attend, there are a number of improvements that can be made to further smooth out the guest experience.  Although there are people helping I would like to see people check kid heights and overall optimizing line wait times. Organizing people in lines, making sure they are in their intended line, etc. Also, we would see groups of two go down 4-person rides where we would eventually get up and be paired with people. Why did they not go with others?  Although the locked attendant eventually helped us, it would be nice if the locker instructions were more visible.  More maps would also be helpful.  Great place and we will return, just come early to avoid long lines.

Great Mexican food, I'll definitely be back. I ordered a number 52: shredded beef chimichanga enchilada style with beans and rice.  The chimichanga was huge, lightly fried, and covered with enchilada sauce and cheese. It was not greasy how some chimis can be. I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty the shredded beef was. It was perfectly cooked, lightly seasoned and very tender. Very generous portion of meat that you can cut with a fork.  The pinto beans were good and had a pork flavor. The rice had a great taste and was very fresh.  We received a complimentary order of chips and roja, verde and pico sauces.  Great place!

Had an immunity juice and it was perfect. I juice at home, but I was in Mesa where people were eating pizza and I needed to get my juice fix.  Kale, spinach, apples, celery, cucumbers and more were in my juice... tasty!  Large 32 oz was about $8, typical price for a very large juice.  The store was clean with fast and pleasant service.

I feel bad disturbing the 5 star trend here as I went here because of the stellar reviews.  Besides the 0 pressure sales, Jiffy Lube has this place beat.  I came on a Friday morning and there were two people waiting. I came into the office and there was no one there so I stood for a few minutes then sat down. Another person came in as  desk guy came in and he got checked in. The desk guy ran back out.  He came back in and I gave him my keys. At this point I was there about 10 minutes. I waited another 30 minutes and it was time to discuss services.  He suggested an air filter which looked dirty so I said to change it, but he checked and they didn't have my type.  When I was ready to go 15 minutes later I asked if they checked the air in my tires (part of the full service oil change) as my tire sensors have been going off when it's cold and he said they did, but sometimes it takes some driving for the light in the car to go off.  Sensor still went off days later so I had to put air in.  Maybe they were overwhelmed or having a bad day, but I did not get good service and the entire visit was awkward.  Ultimately, I don't mind saying no a bunch of times and paying a little more if it means a smooth and quick visit. I'll be going elsewhere next time.

I use the drive-thru weekday mornings and I get a iced sugar free caramel latte. This is the best iced latte I have ever had.  I usually get Starbucks which is a bit towards the bitter side and Dunkin Donuts which is passable but doesn't taste a lot like coffee.  Iced coffee at Buzzberry has a great combination of coffee, milk and syrup. A bit pricey though at over $6 for a large.  But use the $1 with a Yelp check in and get a coffee punch card. You get a free one after 5.

I have been coming to BuzzBerry for over a year because of their good latte's and tasty breakfast snacks. First, I have ordered sugar-free iced & hot caramel & white chocolate latte's.  I enjoy coming here more than other places because they taste just like they should 100% of the time. Sometimes you'll get a new employee that doesn't know what "skinny" is (over multiple days unfortunately), but those times are rare.  I have enjoyed a few muffins and scones and aside from one partially cooked poppy muffin, they have been great. They taste fresh and not like processed junk you get elsewhere.  Other places have reward programs, BuzzBerry has the best in Scottsdale that I am aware of. Buy 5 drinks and get one free. No 30 stars or points which require a reloadable card here. Plus use the $1 off with a Yelp check in.  One concerning item is the employee turn over. I come in at most twice a week and at least every two weeks and I rarely see the same employee twice. Today I saw a new friendly face. The girl who didn't know what skinny is two weeks ago? Gone, just like the other 6 people I have seen in the last few months. It starts to make you wonder about the management if people don't want to stay, but I just want my latte and blueberry scone so unless I see people getting flogged in the back I'll keep coming.  I am curious about their dinner though. They often mention it when ordering and it sounds tempting.

Too many off tasting lattes and undercooked scones, I have stopped going to Buzzberry.  Their consistency definitely lapsed and I find myself going elsewhere for a quality execution.

Popeye's has great chicken tenders. I come here for weekday lunch and the tenders are, crispy, hot and juicy.    I love the mashed potatoes and gravy, neither taste like they were squeezed out of a bag (cough cough KFC).  The biscuits are awesome too.  My most recent trip I tried the blackened tenders which are not fried or battered, but seasoned chicken tenders. They were tasty and slightly more healthy.  I also looked around and there was probably 20 other people there all eating tenders... a good sign.  Come for a great chicken tender meal, especially on weekdays during lunch.

Paradise Bakery is awesome and provided you like sandwiches, soup or salad you can get something you'll love. If I want to get something healthy I will get a classic salad with chicken, corn, pecans and corn/bean mix. If I don't care that day I'll get a 1/2 sandwich and tomato soup. I don't like tomatoes but it tastes like Spagettios.  Plus sandwiches come with a free cookie. Ask for no cookie then get any cookie (instead of chocolate chip) you want.  I have never had anything I didn't love, the selection is great and the iced teas are awesome.

Nancy, Dr. Monahan and all of the staff have been nothing but patient, understanding and professional in every interaction I have had.  I have had minor emergencies where I needed to get in the same day or next and they have always accommodated me.  I was referred here by my girlfriend and I never have regretted coming here.  Nothing but the best from this office and staff.

I have had a mailbox here for over a year and the service is excellent.  The small staff are always helpful and friendly.  I have had things shipped, packed, faxed and copied and I never had a problem as they are there to assist you.  I can get to my box after hours and they don't mind if you call to see if you have a package.  The candy bowl is a plus too.

I don't go to Papi Chulo's very often, but when I do I am pleasantly surprised.  It seems like other Yelpers have a bad time, but the food has always been flavorful, fresh and hot.  We had a Groupon for breakfast or lunch and decided to try breakfast on a Saturday morning.  There was one other table with a couple from the hotel, after they left we were the only customers there.  We both ordered Papi's Breakfast Skillet, one with egg whites and the other with chorizo.  I asked for chips and salsa and got warm chips with salsa, salsa roja (awesome & spicy) and green chili salsa.  The skillet had crispy, seasoned home style potatoes (Papi's potatoes), peppers & onions, jack cheese and egg. It comes with three flour tortillas.  Comparing their skillet to Village Inn & Perkins, Papi's is easily the best.  Hot and tasty and adding some of the salsa roja made it spicy and extra awesome.   Give this place a shot.

The buffet is the best quality I've had with a big variety of tastes. I enjoyed the salad (spring mix), dressing and toppings but I wish there was romaine and other toppings, but who came to eat salad?  There were a lot of sides, I enjoyed the mashed potatoes, best ever charro beans, ok grilled corn, but I would have appreciated a roll. Maybe its a habit.  The meat was awesome, tasty medium well steaks, oven roasted chicken, honey ham, fried cod with tarter sauce, Korean BBQ ribs, Asian wings, all perfect.  The deserts were great too, pies, cheesecake, cake and gelato.  On a Thursday its about $20 for dinner.  For the price of an appetizer, entree and dessert at a nice restaurant you'll probably pay the same.  A vegetarian option or two and signs that note if they are vegetarian would be nice. But it seems that this buffet is more focused on meats which they excel at.

I can't say much for JCPenney itself, but I constantly get compliments for a shirt I purchased there. A t-shirt that has the pictures and names of all of the characters from the Super Mario Bros. Nintendo game. It was cheap and I am glad I found it. It is constantly a talking point with strangers and someone yesterday asked if they could take a picture of it.

Pork on a Fork is an unexpected awesome BBQ place in the north valley.  If you're from Nebraska like me you may appreciate the Cornhuskers "N" on the smoker and picture of windmills & farmers in the dining area.  To me, those are a few of the reasons why I left that terrible place.  No points lost though.  I have only been here during lunch and they usually have a line at the door, come early.  Their brisket, BBQ pork, beans and waffle fries are hot, tasty and fresh. PoaF's meat is awesome. The cornbread is good too. The portions are big too, I typically have to fight the afternoon food coma but it's worth it.  Their sauces aren't anything fantastic, but I enjoy the spicy sauce. The dining areas have flat screen TV's and aren't bad, but the chairs and tables are picnic quality.

Good chicken fingers and sweet potato fries. The chicken fingers taste like they are made in-house and the fries were familiar but good. Friendly service and as long as you sit at the bar it is fast. If you sit on the patio don't expect to see your server but two times.

As far as Dunkin Donut locations go, this one isn't bad however due to the sugar-free caramel taste I took off a star. It tastes like melted plastic. I only get sugar-free syrup and so far the vanilla is the only inoffensive one.  Too bad because I love caramel and other places have good sugar-free caramel.  Every once and a while I try the caramel just to see if they figured it out.

Update, this location is closed. Apparently this location alone filed bankruptcy in 2013 and now finally closed.  In the Phoenix Business Journal (http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2013/12/02/ultrastar-cinemas-scottsdale-theater.html) they mention they were having difficulty making rent payments.  The VP of operations said they were not getting enough people due to a lack of other close entertainment options.

I came during lunch so I could enjoy one of their lunch specials.  Multiple locations in north Phoenix have BBQ chicken pizza on Fridays however this location did not.  I thought this was a Barro's thing, I guess not. Bummer.  I ordered a #2 - two slices and a drink, both sausage.  They was tasty, but not as fresh as I typically have had during lunch.  It was 2:30 and lunch stops at 3, so I'll give them a pass.  Overall, a good lunch deal for slices of pizza.

For my first time at this theater I saw Goosebumps in 3D. Obviously the theater, service, and seats were the best part of the experience.  I have a big head and the glasses squeezed it a little and they were a little heavy, but the overall the movie experience itself was good with great picture quality and sound.  We paid the extra $10 for "premium plus" seating which includes free popcorn, reclining chairs, a small pillow and a throw. It's hard for me to believe, but it's worth it. If you get a small popcorn (free refills) for yourself it's typically $5.50 then the rest for an extremely comfortable couple hour movie experience. It's great. The staff is attentive and friendly. I would have liked a few more food choices though and it's a bit on the expensive side with most entrees over $14.  The entire building is decorated very well and I heard they have couches in the bathrooms. Great place.

Bicycle Vibe is great. I came here to get a rim replaced and a tune up and the price was fair, great work, rewired my bike computer to look better for free and the coffee is good too. If you're in the north Phoenix area, there is no need to look elsewhere for your bicycle needs.

Very solid Dunkin Donuts location. I have ordered complicated multi drink and breakfast sandwich orders on multiple occasions without issue. The staff is very friendly and helps you forget you are at a chain.  Their reward program, prices, service, consistency and lattes keep me coming back. Great location.  Download the app and try the dark roast.

Just an update, this Taco Bell is still a good location to go to if you are into fast "Mexican" food.  They have always made my orders correctly.  I am typically here because of the Dbacks (AZ Diamondbacks) promo which is when they get five runs you can get three free tacos with the purchase of a large drink between 4p & 6p the next day.  $1.00 for supreme tacos; no limit to amount of promos purchased; drive thru & inside.  There is also a very friendly drive thru guy who speaks with a deep voice and gives your total in pennies.  Solid location.

Fast and friendly service, very tasty options. I had a barbacoa bowl with brown rice, black beans, veggies, corn and hot salsa. Terrific.  Girlfriend had the sofritas (tofu) which she said was good as well.  I love their tacos too. I wish they would sell queso though.

I am not very crafty, but sometimes I need a frame, chocolate for a fountain or wall decor.  Hobby Lobby has all of the above and you never need to pay full price. Either they are 40-50% off (some items are 90% off) or look up a coupon before you leave home or on your smart phone and get a 40% off coupon (not on sale merch).

Came in for dinner on a Saturday night at about 9 PM.  A little busy, but the service was fairly quick.  Large selection - mostly bar food.  Girlfriend had a taco salad which had a very greasy shell. I had a club sandwich with fries and a cup of chili.  Fries were made there, crispy and great. Club was not toasted and had no spread. Chili was tasty.  Prices were a bit higher than a Phoenix bar & grill, but I guess it is Cave Creek.

This place is like a garage sale ran by Uncle Scroogle. Junk at high prices. Items are often more than retail even though they are noticeably used. I often like to look at the electronics to chuckle at the prices.  Two of the same item, one in a box that is obviously not the item is double the price. Wow that's expensive for a Playststion that obviously doesn't work.  Multiple dollars for cheap glassware from McDonalds. Stupid. Maybe the clothes rack has a deal or two, but avoid everything else.

When I first started coming to WinCo I would walk through the isles and marvel at how much lower the prices were on the exact same items I was buying elsewhere. After a couple years my jaw doesn't drop anymore, but I am still pleasantly surprised by the lower prices.  It becomes apparent where WinCo is able to save money: warehouse style, bagging yourself, no credit cards, limited variety of items.  These are all fine with me, but don't get hung up on the variety.  They still have name brand, not just every kind. 1-2 name brand and 1-2 generic variations per item.  Their produce is always terrific and so much cheaper than other places. How can they get away with selling bell peppers so cheap?  They also have a great bulk item selection with items you wouldn't expect to be sold by the pound. Individually wrapped candies, croutons, big sugar-free candy selection.  Great place, I just wish there was one in Scottsdale.

Rob is a pro. He does a terrific job, explains everything from what he is doing, after care to preventative steps. He even left a bottle with solution for future spots.  He is obviously a people pleaser and will do just about anything to please a customer.  I found him through Yelp because of good reviews and he doesn't disappoint. Sometimes he is very busy (lots of happy customers to help) and he does all of his appointments, so be patient with contacting and scheduling.  When he cleans your carpets, rugs and couches you will not be disappointed. I even got my apartment deposit back when I thought it was a lost cause.

Perfect place to park your car. Make sure you sign up for their rewards program online to avoid the reservation fee and to earn free days.  If you have a AAA card, go to their site to get coupons for when you are leaving.  The staff is always friendly and efficient. They pick you up right at your car, I have never had to wait more than a minute or two for a shuttle at the airport and they drop you back off at your car. Then you get a bottle of water for each person as you leave.  Best price, service and very convenient.

Avoid the ketchup at all costs. It tastes like ground up tomatoes and that's about it, please stick to what you know or try more spices. Hamburger was ok, but the fries, well I will stick to the frozen kind at home. This bar seems to push their beer selection more than anything else, but I wouldn't get your hopes up in regards to the food.  I'll give two stars for effort, but that's it. It's nice that they are trying new things, but move on from what doesn't work. I'm looking at you homemade pop tarts.

Goodwill like any second-hand store is hit or miss, but this location seems to have good deals. I often find myself in Savers or some other weird second-hand store trying to sell me something used for more than new and this location doesn't seem to do that.  I am currently sitting on a $400 leather recliner with only very minor cat scratches in a 2 inch area for only $50.  Sure the guy that helped me load the chair acted like he just lit up, but it's better than me breaking my back.

The movie theater and interior alone I give five stars, however the arcade and laser tag are bad enough I can only give four.  I did not sit in the star class as I went to an early movie, however the leather seats were plenty comfortable.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful, even with rough spots but more on that later.  The sound and video was great and the concessions is the usual frustratingly high price. They do have caramel and cheese popcorn.  If you get a large drink or popcorn, be sure to get refills and put the popcorn in a sealable bag when you get home.  Games are played using credits on a card, tickets are also loaded to the card's account.  Numerous arcade games were broken, many where their start button didn't work. I spoke to the bowling desk and they credited back the credits.  They offer respectable ticket reception room.  Laser tag was a bit frustrating starting with arrival, we got our tickets which included a start time. However we showed up and there was a line of people out of the door. About ten minutes after our time we all went in.  The course was on two levels and offered many places to hide, but not for long.  Unfortunately I did not have much success hitting people. I held my gun in two places like others until it lit up and shot people standing two feet in front of me unobstructed with no hits. Perhaps I'm that bad?  The interior of the center is immaculate and contemporary and they offer many different entertainment and food options. Great place, but be careful in the arcade and laser tag.

I have only been to Barro's for lunch, but I have always had a good meal.  I usually get a sausage & slice of the day (BBQ chicken) and they are both terrific.  Two slices of pizza & a soda for about $5 is a great deal. And the BBQ chicken pizza is excellent.

My vegetarian girlfriend and I decided to go out for a late night bike ride to have dinner at a place with a patio. We settled on this place because of the reverse happy hour ($5 apps) and the veggie burger.  Although the table sign and tv's both mentioned the reverse happy hour and $5 apps, no go because it's summer? I would think you would have specials in the summer as it was 11:30 PM and it was still 101° F. Argh  I let the gf order first and we were told they were out of veggie patties. We asked for a pretzel ($5 for one - $5 for two for reverse happy hour) prior to this and we said we will need a minute. The waitress came back and I asked to pay and we will eat our pretzel before we go. Paid, signed and then our pretzel came. Took about 25 minutes.  The pretzel was great and the cheese dip was familiar (likely a shelf brand) but it was good. Had to ask for napkins and the music was so loud that we hard a hard time hearing each other.  A disappointment.

Great place to get a hot dog that isn't boring. Hot dogs come on warm naan bread and you'll be glad a standard bun isn't used. They have a lot of free toppings to choose from and even dogs with clever names for interesting combinations.  Their selection of dogs is diverse and I love the spicy one. If you just want a normal hot dog with ketchup, although it will be tasty you may want to take your simple tastes elsewhere. The free toppings are basically included in the price of your hot dog.  Great place and very friendly owners.

This Buffalo Wild Wings locations is the best, most consistent location I have been to. The staff is friendly and quick, their happy hour appetizers are cheap (less than $5 for chips & queso + meat) and their wings are tasty.  I always get wings with the desert heat rub. Surprisingly, it is awesome and I want to buy to take home. It's spicy, but not overpowering. It sticks to the meat well too.  I usually a sauce too, I like mango habanero which is spicy and could be too spicy for some, I like it and there is a sweet taste as well.  The potatoes wedges which are seasoned wedges with chives, you can add cheese and bacon.

Today was my first time at Smashburger and although I liked the burger, I was not blown away and I didn't love the fries.  I had a BBQ cheeseburger (minus cheese) on a chipotle bun. There was tasty BBQ sauce, crisp pickles and I barely detected the onion strings (I think that's what they're called).  The beef was cooked well, juicy without being greasy and had a good taste. I also enjoyed the bun which tasted fresh and had a slight spice to it.  I enjoyed the burger, but I think I will try a different type, perhaps the classic one in an attempt to truly appreciate their burger prowess.  I saw that the fries are of the shoestring persuasion, which I generally pass on, so I got the spicy fries which are dry dusted with Frank's Red Hot spice.  This definitely added flavor, but did not make me love shoestring fries. They were however crispy and plentiful.  In summary, I will return and I can appreciate why everyone loves Smashburger, but I will need to return and try a few more items.  Also note, I came at 6 PM on a weekday and they were very busy. However I only had a short wait. The staff was very friendly too.

Garbanzo is a tasty, fresh Mediterranean place that has a variety of items for your wrap, pits or bowl. The prices are reasonable at $8-$10 for a big entree.  It seems that I am timid around Mediterranean food and I just got a chicken pita with lettuce, onions and garlic sauce.  I also got fresh potato chips. I saved the pits for the next day in the fridge and it was great. The chicken had a good grill taste.  The chips were tasty too.   I probably wouldn't come back here by myself as I don't care for a lot of the toppings, but they look great and the girlfriend enjoyed her loaded up pita.

Clean Freak has a solid car wash, free vacuums and friendly service.  The quick detailing they do for less than $20 is ok, but you can just use the vacuum yourself and save the detail cost and tip.  The one time I did have them clean the interior then my car didn't start afterwards (I later determined I needed a new battery - stupid AZ).  The manager was super nice and was ok with my car being there as I figured it out.  Another extremely nice customer left and got his battery charger and despite his help it wouldn't start. I eventually got it out of there, but the staff was very friendly, concerned and helpful when they didn't necessarily have to. Kudos to the staff!

Joe's Real BBQ has a great taste, but a few things are lacking.  First, eating great local BBQ in an airport is awesome.  I ordered the meat plate with hot links, pulled pork, beans and cornbread.  The meats had a great flavor and the links definitely tasted fresh and custom. The pulled pork was a bit overpowered by the sauce (admittedly I said yes to having sauce poured on it).  The BBQ beans were absolutely awesome, don't leave without getting them. Different types of beans, onions, pieces of meat and other tasty bits. A little spicy too.  The plate came with two slices of bread that tasted homemade, but they were a bit stale.  Unfortunately they didn't have spicy sauce and the container for warm (labeled) sauce was not warm.  I also got a slice of cornbread and I was asked if I wanted honey butter and to get it warmed up.  This allowed the butter to melt a little on top.  The cornbread was excellent; crispy on top and moist in the middle.

WinCo is a great grocery store with no frills (i.e. self bagging & no CC's), but you definitely see savings.  There are other stores with cheap prices, but WinCo unlike others does not have a limited selection.  There is a huge bulk item selection and many variations of popular brand items that I rarely if ever see anywhere else.  This store has always been clean and even on weekends isn't that busy.

Good taco & ambience, but their service and chips were so terrible that I question ever coming back.  My fiancé and I were greeted by the hostess and were seated.  About five minutes later someone came by and asked if our server came by, we said no and ordered our drinks and chips & salsa.  We got our chips & salsa and about 40% of the chips were stale. They tasted like they were cheap restaurant-style chips (which are typically large), but we're obviously broken into smaller pieces. The salsa wasn't bad, but nothing to return for.  As we chomped on chips which many were just plain hard,  we wondered where our drinks were and we wished we had ordered waters to tide us over while we wait for our drinks.  Another waitress came by (I guess the waitress the other one talked about?) and saw that we were half way through our chips & salsa with no drinks. She asked if we would like waters and we quickly responded, yes please.  We never received our waters although that waitress passed us over six times afterwards.  The patio was almost full, but there was only one group inside.  There were two bartenders and a whole bunch of servers which were mostly talking to each other and putting orders in.  Fifteen minutes after ordering we got our drinks, we were almost done with our chips.  At that point we were asked if we wanted to order entrees.  Based on the wait I decided to just get one BBQ chicken taco. I only had to wait about five minutes and I enjoyed the taco. But honestly it was soured by the poor experience.  I acknowledge that maybe we got the bottom of the chip bin, but the server confusion, forgetfulness and over ten minute wait for 2 drinks all on a Sunday that wasn't that busy is just disappointing.  With such a variety of taco places, I can't recommend this place.

This place is where budgets go to die. I have been to many grocery stores in the valley and their prices only rival AJ's. Even the downtown Safeway on McDowell has lower prices and they're ridiculous.  At least AJ's is well kept and has other redeeming qualities.  First, it's extremely obvious this is just a rebranded Albertsons. Same fixtures, cracked and unsightly flooring and the feeling you are in some crotchety Ebenezer-run supermarket. Nice on the outside to get you in, ugly store and outrageous prices when you arrive.  I heard about the whole debacle between Haggens / Albertsons / Safeway, this seemed inevitable... the store is closing with everything on sale. This is the only reason I entered, but I probably would have went in otherwise just to laugh at the prices.  Most items are 30% off, soft drinks and chips 10%, meat & booze 20%. Even with the discounts, many items are still higher than Wal-Mart and even Fry's.  I saw a cooler that sounded like a good deal after 30% off, looked it up in Wal-Mart's app, they have the same brand double the size for the same price (after 30% off).  I did get a good deal on a few things that are the same price elsewhere then 30% off helped: deodorant and gum. Stock up sale!  There are some deals to be had, just get here soon. The place still has a good stock as of 11/7/2015. Just be sure you're getting a deal.

There were about 7-8 food trucks then other tent vendors.  We arrived at noon and the lines were only 1-4 people long, however as we left at 2 PM most were 7+.  Many vendors displayed the line system: regular, sample and express. But there was only one visible line at vendors. Some vendors did call out to VIP / express with wristbands though.  Coming just to buy an entree seems to be the best use of your money, the VIP package includes tickets that are difficult to use.  The soda and water stand was completely out shortly after we arrived.  Everyone found out that the only place to get water or soda with drink tickets was the hot dog stand near Glendale Ave.  With my sample tickets I received BBQ pork, short ribs, two Coyote Oaties oatmeal cookies (THE BEST item there), awful Sysco "cookie trio", Longhorn pretzel bites and steak. My food from the vendors was good, especially the oatmeal cookies and pretzel bites.  Many vendors were either not offering samples of sold out... by 1 PM. Luckily the oatmeal cookie vendor's store is directly behind their stand.  The event also had "sample village" stands which featured food service items from box to table. Sysco cookies and other items which all had the same brand on the boxes. Don't go to these.  The vendor food is good, however I learned you do not pre-purchase food truck event tickets.
