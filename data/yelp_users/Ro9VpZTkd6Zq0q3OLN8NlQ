Being a Chicagoian and missing some good yet simple food a former colleague of mine took me here.  I got 2 cheese dogs and the garlic fries. The cheese dogs were great. As we sat and ate our food I presented the statement/question of.... how is it that some places can't cook a good hot dog? Luckily, this place has a good hot dog.  The garlic fries were ok but I had some of the chili cheese fries my friend ordered and those were better. The portions were very large and they had game 7 of the Chicago Bulls vs Brooklyn Nets game on... Perfect. I was trying to rush home to catch the game but now I was able to enjoy this good Chicago style food while watching the Bulls beat the Nets.

People that follow my reviews might notice that I eat a lot of Mexican food. I'm also a Mexican food snob and this place is fantastic!!!!  I live down the street and when I saw this small place I knew I had to try it. It reminds me of Chicago - my home town.   I love the tacos, especially the tongue tacos. I order #6 very often.  I tried their burrito once and I wasn't a big fan of it but I think that's just an Arizona thing. Burritos in this area are made in a different style than what I'm used to back home. My friends from Arizona love their burritos.  I highly recommend and the prices are great.

My favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale.  TACO TUESDAYS! Love the Salmon Y Mango taco. The Pescado taco is also really good.  Every taco I've tried there is good and it was the first time I've ate cactus. Not my favorite item of food, I'm assuming it's categorized as a vegetable....? I love margaritas but I prefer frozen however they don't offer frozen just as many restaurants in the Phoenix area don't. With that said, they offer great margaritas.  Love the environment. Modern Mexican, yet comfortable and not pretentious. Great selection of tequila and a staff that knows the menu.

A friend of mine already knew about this place but forgot about it until he found it on Yelp. 3 of us made it near the end of their happy hour and I was in the mood to try something new. Personally, I'm a fan of wheat beers and decided to try the Konig Ludwig Weiss, I absolutely loved this beer and will return just for the beer as I don't know anywhere else in the area that carries it.  I ordered the pork tostadas as an appetizer. I wish the server told me how large the portions were because they were huge and I wasn't hungry from the dinner I had ordered. This appetizer was great and on the Happy Hour Menu. For dinner I got duck over some berries and mustard seeds. Normally I'm not a fan of mustard but I really enjoyed this aspect of the meal. The duck was eh-ok. The portion size of the duck wasn't that much considering it costs about $15 and it was a bit too well done for my liking.  The service was ok. Everyone was really nice but I felt as if the waitress was a bit new so I gave her some leeway. Overall, I enjoyed the place. If you don't come during happy hour your bill with 1 drink will probably be about $25 plus per person. I'll be back for the beer and appetizers.

Best sushi in AZ. I eat a lot of sushi and the fresh and original taste here can't be beat, especially for the price. I love to sit at the sushi bar and do Omakase - letting Chef J really show his skills and in my opinion it's the best way to taste the rainbow and try things you never had before.

This is a very unique space. It officially has it's Grand Opening on October 27th but it's been providing free yoga classes since early October. My sister in law, myself and my girlfriend have gone to a few yoga classes.  The owner, Jeremy told us that he will be providing a community with yoga and art this year with more to come in the future. I had a yoga class with Jeremy but he said there will be several yoga trainers teaching different styles and even offer 1 on 1.  Beautiful view of Camelback mountain from the street. Great parking in the back and I look forward to going more frequently.

I rarely write bad reviews. I'm literally walking out of their office right now in Biltmore because they turned me away because I was seven minutes late.The entire reason why I am going to see them is because I got my ear cleaned out by them 7 days ago and now I haven't been able to hear out of my left ear for 5 days.   The arrogant receptionist told me to go to an urgent care doctor and said I can't wait to be next in line.
