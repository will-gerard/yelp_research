I don't understand why restaurants can invest in filtered water. The water at this venue is terrible. They use the syrup and Tea to cover up the taste and smell. Ultimately drinking it is not good for your body. Guys and investment in filtering your water will increase the quality of the experience your customers have.

Thank God for this place. When all else is closed and you want a great meal (sushi or a burger) this is the spot to go. Service is great and so is the atmosphere... If you sit at the sushi bar during happy hour your first drink is free! The owner often visits your table to say hi... Smart move!

Was here before and the service was terrible. Stopped in tonight for a beer and a water and OMG, the h2o tasted like it could have come from Tempe town lake. NEver understand why bars can't spend $100 on a water filter.... Clean water makes a big difference!
