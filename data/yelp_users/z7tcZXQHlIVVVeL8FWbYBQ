I seem to be having a very different experience than a lot of people. I have enjoyed the sushi, the cost is low, and the service has always been pretty prompt.   Overall, after going here semi-regularly since they have opened, I have found it better than many of the more trendy places in the valley. By no means the best in the world, but pretty solid.

Horrible. This place has not changed since I worked there 24 years ago. Granted, I was the worst busser in the world, but that does not excuse the bad food, old decor, tired menu, and lackluster staff.   The food is essentially taco bell but more expensive. The guacamole is neon green without flavor, the food swims in grease, and the beans and rice are often cold by the time they get to the table.  There are better restaurants just a few minutes away.

I really like this place. I have gone there several times with a colleague from Turkey and he vouches for it being genuine. The food is great and the service fast.

I don't understand the hype. The food is okay, the alcohol selection is limited, the service is slow, and the ambience is strained. I have been dragged here many times and it seems popular as the only 'upscale' bar for the undergraduate sorority set.
