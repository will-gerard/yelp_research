A champagne experience on a beer budget!   My favorites are the Thai Chicken wrap or salad (very spicy peanut dressing on the side), the turkey sandwich with caramelized onions and their famous asparagus Panini. Of course you must indulge in a dessert from the case. You can't go wrong with anything at Bertha's but the pies from Pie Snob (see my other review just on the pie) are my personal favorite.   Bertha's is unpretentious and homey and always very busy at lunch but the line goes fast and the service is wonderful. They also have China Mist iced tea - yes!

Finding the idea of chicken and waffles very intriguing and being almost as big of a syrup lover as Will Ferrell in Elf, I had to give Lolo's a try upon finding out it was in my backyard.   I went with two friends at lunchtime on a Thursday and the place was packed. While they seem to still be figuring out the service (we were "forgotten about" several times), the food was excellent.   I had the Betty Boop - chicken breast and a waffle, both of which were delicious. I was not disappointed with the syrup either. We shared a few sides - mac and cheese, fried okra and greens. The greens were really delicious, slightly spicy and full of flavor. The mac and cheese was not bad, the fried okra nothing special.   All in all, a great atmosphere, good comfort food and I think this new location will do really well, esp. if they decide to stay open late and cater to the "must sober up" crowd.

Addicted from bite one! I love Bertha's cafe on Indian School and 32nd St. and I've often been tempted to try a slice of the delicious looking pies from Pie Snob in their pastry case. Well, today was the day! My coworker and I shared a piece of the apple pie and I've never tasted crust that good before. It's so flakey and tender. The apples were perfectly tart and balanced really well with the sweetness of the filling. After I had the first bite I really wished I had ordered my own slice so I wouldn't have to share :-)

Mocha paradise! Having an iced mocha from Royal is like your taste buds spending the night at the Ritz while having one at SBUX is more of a Holiday Inn experience - both do their job but there's just something super special about Royal's. The best part is that there are actually 2 spots to pick up this delight at The Biltmore, one inside The Red Door Spa and one inside The Union area (love the local shops in there!). They also have amazing little blueberry fritters- yum. Treat yourself the next time you're in the area :-)

Who organizes this event? Satan? ;) They need to reexamine every aspect, from the parking situation to the crazy confusing entrance lines to the ridiculous tokens you have to stand in a huge line to purchase - before standing in another line to order tacos and then yet another line to pick them up. What? No joke. It was #TacoHell.   The only positives were the awesome surf band and the pepper eating contest (and one or two good tacos).   The whole flow of traffic in the taco areas and tequila tent made no sense. The worst part was that there was nobody around to give info or answer questions. The amount of money they were bringing in had to be substantial. Use a bit to work out the logistics next time demonic planning committee.

I am a member of the DBG and had just been to Gertrude's the week before which was a great experience so when my friends asked where they could take me for my birthday it was at the top of my list. I had made a reservation for 6:15 but arrived a bit early so we had a drink at the bar. The bartender, Sam, was wonderful and the garden rita was delicious. Then we were seated on the gorgeous patio and looked forward to a great evening.   Our waiter did not show up for a while and when he did he was completely disengaged and clearly did not want to be there. He knew nothing about the menu, had no recommendations and just seemed plain grumpy. At one point he even told us that he was supposed to get off at 6:00 - so why did he take our table when our reservation was after that time?! My friend asked if we could order the special macaroni and cheese that the bartender had us salivating over when he described it because it was my birthday. He did bring out a very small cup of macaroni and cheese with a candle but it was not the special macaroni and cheese, just one from the kids menu.   When we were about halfway done with our food, he did not offer us more drinks or dessert, just brought the check. When I said we wanted to order dessert he seemed upset and we felt like we were causing a big hassle. I felt embarrassed that I had suggested Gertrude's. The food was good but not worth putting up with the bad service.  After we paid our check we were still hanging out talking and he was gone. Nobody else came by to offer water, thank us for coming or anything. Very disappointing birthday experience . I'm giving 2 stars only because of the previous good experience with the hope that things improve.

Stell Roofing is the best! I had requested 3 quotes from companies a few months ago and not only was Stell the best price (we were paying out of pocket, not going through an insurance company), they also had the most comprehensive warranty and were the most responsive in answering questions. They had an awesome crew led by Junior who showed up in the early morning and we had a new roof by that afternoon! It looks fantastic and we could not be happier. I'm sure our neighbors are also very happy we finally got it done :).  Thanks to Mike, Michelle, Junior and the whole team!

Taste bud paradise! It is really hard to name my favorites, I've been there 4 times since they opened and it's true love. I've never had Spanish rice like this - an inventive concoction that includes chorizo and pineapple chunks. You must also have the short rib tacos. You're welcome. The carne asada and al pastor are also wonderful. The guac is acado-riffic and the fresh, limey, just-the-right-amount-of-everything, ceviche is going to be the absolute perfect meal come summer. Go on Sangria Saturday for the perfect experience. The best part are the prices - completely reasonable. My husband and I had an app, an adult beverage and a whole lot of tacos and rice for about $30. There's not a lot of seating inside so get there early in the 100+ degree days. Enjoy!

3 words - Chocolate Almond Croissant. Not just chocolate, not just almond but BOTH! Together in an unholy, delicious union! This made my morning a delight.   I went back for lunch the same day and had a wonderful chicken pot pie. It's not the usual huge pot pie you might find in the freezer section; instead it's a smaller, lighter, flakier, tastier version. It's served with a very simple salad of greens lightly dressed with vinaigrette in the French manner.  I liked it because you don't leave feeling like you have a lead brick in your stomach. The best way I could describe it is - elegant comfort food. Now go get one of those croissants!   Note - they are closed on Mondays. Those days I have to make do with a cardboard protein bar. Sigh.

I've been wanting to try this little place forever and finally decided to give it a go.  I placed a take-out order for the tagliatelle bolognese and the pollo parmigiana. The gentleman who took my order was very pleasant and called me back a few minutes after I placed my order to inform me that they were almost out of tagliatelle and would I mind if fettuccine noodles were used to make up the difference (I said I did not mind at all). The restaurant is very nice inside and we had high hopes for the food. Once we got it home though we were immediately disappointed. There was hardly any sauce, especially for the bolognese. Honestly, it was about a tablespoon of sauce which barely covered the pasta and the worst part is that it was very bland. The chicken on the pollo parmigiana dish was fatty and not seasoned well.   The reason I am giving La Fontana two stars instead of one is for the mini cannollis which were delicious. Sadly I don't think I will give the food another try for a while. I hope they are able to improve the quality of the food soon as the service was terrific. I'll keep an eye on the reviews.

Luisana is awesome! I have been going to this location for the past 5 months and it has made such a difference in how I feel every day. Luisana listens to me, finds the exact tension spots that are causing issues and always makes sure the pressure, temperature, etc. are all to my liking. The front desk staff is always very nice as well. I can't wait for my next appointment!
