First time sitting in China Chili and so glad that I did as I was able to get their fresh wonton soup. (Unfortunately I could not remember the name of the soup--thank goodness the table behind me was eating it and I was able to point it out the waitress) The wonton soup came with 8 large wontons, broccoli, chicken, green onions, and other Chinese vegetables in a savory white broth. The soup came out in a large bowl and was piping hot--almost burned my tongue a couple of times, but it was worth it as it was very flavorful and not too salty.The soup with tax came to $8, which was a surprise as I thought that it would be more for the size. I would definitely come back here for lunch as the price you pay for the amount of food that you get and the quality is great. The only negatives was the service (the waiters stood around not too far from our table looking extremely bored) and the chicken corn chowder soup, which was bland and left a lot to be desired. I only ate it because I was very hungry and had to wait 15 minutes for my friend to show up (smile)

I went to Flo's restaurant on a recommendation from a co-worker and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the broccoli beef and it was amazing--such wonderful flavor with the sauce, thinly sliced beef and various vegetables--on my way home I started eating some and I could not stop. I really wanted to turn around, go back, and get another order (smile). Next time that I go I will have to sit in versus getting take out as it looks like a very nice and relaxing atmosphere. The staff that I did interact with were very friendly and open to changing the soy based sauce that usually comes with the broccoli beef to a white sauce (I am allergic to soy)  I hope that in the near future that Flo will open up another restaurant--hopefully in Old town Scottsdale or central Phoenix, so those of us who live in Mesa, Tempe, and south of North Scottsdale can have quicker access to Flo's amazing food!

Was sent here by a friend after we went to have Chinese food a couple of months ago. He told me that I had to try to this place as it was one of the best places he had Mongolian Beef--ever! At first I could not find the restaurant and thought that maybe it had closed. But, after driving past the Subway and looking up I finally found it. I was extremely hungry and walked as quickly as I could to the back where the check out counter was. I had to wait for a few minutes as the wait staff was running around trying to fill orders in the cramped and crowded dining area. The dining area has about 15 tables and depending on how many folks are sitting at the table you may or may not be able to get by. Finally one of the waiters acknowledged me and I ordered the large shrimp and vegetables, which with tax only totaled $8.50.   I decided to take a seat and immediately a waitresses acknowledged me and tried to hand me a menu. I explained to her that I was just sitting waiting for my order--she smiled and moved on. The restaurant is very small and packed full of people--but for the price and food it is worth being a little cramped. All of the food on their tables looked amazing. I waited for about 10 minutes for my food and it was so worth the wait. The shrimp and vegetables were lightly covered in a white sauce and it was all piping hot. There were large chunks of broccoli and carrots--unfortunately you could barely see the 10-12 little shrimp floating around; but it was a great meal. I will definitely be coming back in a couple of weeks to sit in and enjoy their food.

My friends and I were searching for a soul food place and were told to go here by a Vegas native. Was not expecting this place to be as good as it was and it caught all of us by surprise. It is way north of the strip, but so worth the drive. Gritz Café is located on a small street off of MLK road in a business park/strip mall.   As we walked in we noticed the place was very small (about 10 tables) and it smelled like Heaven. The staff greeted us right away, gave us menus, and told us to take our time ordering. We felt right at home when we walked in the door as the staff reminded us of our family members and their good home cooking. It was great to see the variety of main and side item choices on the menu. I selected the Louisiana, which was a hot link plate and a side of grits with bacon bits (first toping is free) and greens; and a piece of cornbread. My friends order fried chicken, fried catfish, waffles, mac n' cheese, greens, and eggs.   Our food was brought out one by one by a wonderful server who was very attentive and sweet. The food was very hot, fresh, and flavorful. The hot links had just the right amount of spice, the grits(z) were smooth and creamy, and the greens were seasoned just right that I did not even need any hot sauce! (smile) All of us shared our food, so I got a chance to try the mac n' cheese and waffles that were just as flavorful and wonderful. We spent the entire meal talking about how awesome the food was and how we want to come back the next time we were in Vegas. The only thing missing in the restaurant was some cots as we all needed a nap afterwards. (smile)  It is hard to find good soul food in Phoenix, so each time I go to Vegas Gritz will be on my list of restaurants to eat at! So worth the drive for the awesome food and service!!

Went here for dinner on Sunday evening and was very disappointed at first by two things: The price ($15.50) and the customer service. We were practically yelled at by one of the managers that we were in the wrong line as we walked up--at the time there was no one else in the line but us, so we did not understand why she became so angry. As we continued our meal the waiters were pretty much non existent and when they were around were very tight lipped and rude. The one bright light in all of this was the food was actually good--I had the chicken noodle soup, salmon, sweet/white fish, spinach salad (added onions and cucumbers), slice of pepperoni pizza, and two small desserts (red velvet cake). They had an awesome selection of desserts--I just wish that they had the same diverse selection in their dinner items especially for the price. I do not think that I will be returning to this buffet and I do not recommend it to anyone. For the price I think that you can do much better in variety and customer service.

This has become a must every time that I go to Vegas. The food and atmosphere are always amazing and so worth the wait (which is usually a lot less than they tell you, so eat a little bit before or bring a snack and you will be in your seat in no time!).This time I decided to get their fried chicken salad, as in all the years I had been here I've never had one of their salads, so I had to try! I asked the waitress if I could have more spinach than iceberg lettuce and she said "sure'. When she brought out the salad of course it was huge and was meant for three people versus just one. I decided to tackle the salad like Adam on man vs. food; and of course food won. The salad came with a sweet and tangy mustard sauce, that I got on the side, and it was filled with greens, blue cheese, cherry red tomatoes, and a huge chicken breast that I cut up into small pieces and tossed in the salad. It came with one of their awesome and flaky biscuits on the side. I asked for jam and butter; and when I cut and bit into the warm biscuit with the jam and butter it just melted. I ended up taking most of the salad and half of the biscuit home--I am still eating on it!   I would recommend Hash House A Go Go for anyone wanting great quality and quantity food at a great price. (my salad was only $14!) It is a Vegas staple and a fun place to check out! I definitely recommend sharing an entrée.

Went to this buffet after my aunt's wedding and I was very impressed. Since we were a large group of 40 they reserved us a space near the buffet. The service by our two waitresses were awesome. They quickly came and took our drink orders and were so nice!   The food selection was amazing. There was a huge selection of prepared meats, salads, pastas, and vegetables. There was a mix of Italian, Mexican, Mediterranean, Soul Food, and Asian flavors in the buffet. So, if you had a particular type of food that you liked you could find it or vice-versa. I loved that they had a deli bar with a fresh selection of meat and cheeses. I was able to add some cheese to these flavorful beans and sausage soup that I had--so delicious and the cheese just brought out more of the flavor! My plate was filled with a little bit of everything! I so wish I had a few extra stomachs or just more room in my one so I could have gone back a few more times. I am always a little unsure of buffets, but you could tell that the food was freshly prepared and put out for dinner time.   The dessert selection--no words to describe how it was. I have never seen such a great selection of desserts anywhere. They had everything from pies, cakes, cookies, cheesecake bites, ice cream,   The only thing is I wish that the buffet was a little less expensive. For it being off the strip and $25 it was a little pricey, but I feel it is worth for the most part because of the food selection and service. I would choose this spot if you are looking to get a dinner with a wide variety of options!

I've been looking for a local and homemade ice cream spot for years and I absolutely love Churn! I was greeted with a warm smile and welcome by a handsome, tall, and kind server. He provided samples of a few of their ice creams to my friend and I. I tried the vanilla and chocolate mint--and both were delicious. They were so rich, creamy, and smooth; it was hard to decide which one I wanted, so the server suggested that I get a half scoop of each. I decided to do just that and add a half an oatmeal cookie to top it off. The mixture of the sweetness of the vanilla and chocolate mint and the saltiness of the cookie were just right and it was just enough to fill my sweet tooth. The cost was not bad at all--just $4.   I love that this spot is local, they give samples, they have new flavors, and they are so welcoming and friendly. Definitely when I am back in Phoenix I plan to return to Churn!

Oh Michael's where do I even begin...What my friends and I remember about  ladies night was not what we experienced this past Thursday night (see the fixes below). I will admit we did not get there until a little bit before 8pm, so there was not a lot of food left at the free buffet, but the server was nice enough to give us the last of the food. The cucumber/cream cheese appetizer and macaroni and cheese were amazing--I wish that there would have been more of this. Also, because we got there later all of the tables were filled up and we ended up standing for about 30 minutes until a table opened up--so I definitely recommend getting there at 7 or earlier.   Positives: The music--until 10pm they have a live R&B band which is amazing! They play a great mix of classic and new R&B. They encourage you to dance and it is a lot of fun! The live DJ played more Chicago stepping music this past Thursday, so if you did not know how to step you pretty much kept bumping into people on the dance floor. Ladies night is awesome because ladies get in for free, they give you a rose, they have a free buffet, and they give away prizes--I won a pair of Diamondbacks tickets--smile!  Fixes: The service was horrendous. Michael's is not that big and maybe has 15 tables and there were 4-5 wait staff, so why did our waitress never come back to check on us, refill our water, or ask how our food was? I ended up taking our water cups to the bar and asking the bartender to refill them.Also, my guy friend ended up getting our wine at the bar as I our waitress never returned. She came a total of four times--to get our menu, to get our order, and to drop off/pick up our check. If we did not go get beverages ourselves we would have never gotten them and spent the rest of the evening thirsty.   The food---oh gosh, were do I start? On Thursday nights they have a smaller menu, so there are only a few items to choose from ranging from $7-$15. My friends and I decided to order the nachos with fried chicken added and the sampler platter with catfish, waffle fries, and chicken wings. We were surprised by the lack of food that was on the plates when they were brought out. After getting over that we started to taste the food and it left a lot to be desired. The cheese on the nachos was cold, runny, and tasteless; the chips were the same kind you see at the movies when you order nachos; and there was no salsa, sour cream, beans, etc.--just fried chicken, cheese, and chips--it was such a disappointment that we sent it back. The sampler platter food was not any better as it was cold as well. The best thing on the platter was the waffle fries as you could tell they used some good seasoning . But, isn't that sad that the best thing on a sampler platter is the fries?!? And they have the nerve to put on the bottom of their menu "We specialize in quality over quantity"--my answer to that is you all specialize in neither one as the food needs a major upgrade.  I am unsure of what has happened to Michael's Café in the span of just a few months, but they need to make some major changes before I return again--if I ever return. The food and service is a joke and I expected a lot more from a restaurant that I enjoyed so much--now that is in the past. I wish that I could recommend another spot instead of this to go where you can get live R&B music and food, but many of them have closed.

OHSO is such an amazing place with amazing food. I have been here a couple of times and I am planning on going back again soon. The food selection, service, and their dedication to the community are outstanding. The first time I went I tried several of their beers/ciders and the waitress was so friendly, knowledgeable, and patient regarding our selection. They have an awesome selection of local beers--the only sad thing is it changes often, so if you really like a beer/cider you better get two or three because you might not see it again. It is great that they have $1 tasters, so you can try as many as your heart desires. For our entrée my friend and I shared their Kalua Pork--it was so tender, juicy, and sweet--I would have licked the plate if I could. For dessert we had their amazing caramel apple pie.  This past time I had their Spicy Pulled Pork and French fries out on their patio--the pork was very juicy and sweet--unfortunately it was a little too juicy as the bread became very soggy and it was hard to eat, but it was still wonderful. Like I said I plan on coming back here again particularly on a Sunday for their $10 beer and brunch.  OHSO is definitely a wonderful and fun find.

Went here with a friend this evening and was pleasantly surprised by the food and relaxing atmosphere. My friend and I shared the chicken tiki marsala, chicken saag, and garlic naan. The chicken marsala and saag we had mild flavored and it was still very well seasoned and delicious. The garlic naan was light and soft and went great with the two chicken dishes. They give you a lot of food, so be prepared to share and to take some home. My friend and I definitely plan on going back as they have a lunch buffet and the waiting staff was very nice.

I love Mediterranean food, so when I was at an art event on Sunday and saw that they had $7.99 lunch specials I had to jump on it. I decided to take out my food as I was helping with the event. I walked in and was not expecting the beautiful décor. The bar area and tables are beautifully decorated with blue, silver, and a touch of gold. I had to wait a little while for someone to come up as to what I could see there was only a manager and a hostess working. The manager was extremely nice and apologetic for the wait and quickly handed me a menu. I could not decide between the chicken shwarma and the Mediterranean sliders; but the manager recommended the sliders, which comes with a salad and pita bread. I asked the manager if I could add some hummus for the pita bread and he told me they would. I waited for about 15 minutes for my food and when I received my bill I was surprised--it suddenly went from around the $7.99+tax to $17.99. I asked the waitress how much the hummus was and she told me that you get a good amount for the price. I signed my check, but I was not happy. The manager brought out my food and apologized profusely for the mistake and put a free dessert and extra hummus and salad for the trouble. I told him thank you and that I would be back as the waitress and himself were very nice.  Once I sat down at ate my food--omg, it was so good! The hummus had a nice layer of sweet olive oil and the pita bread was warm and soft. There were two sliders and they were extremely juicy and flavorful. I am unsure of what kinds of buns they use, but they soaked up the juice from the meat and were not soggy at all. The salad came with tomato, lemon, cucumbers, and an olive oil dressing, which complimented all of the flavors well.  Overall this was a great restaurant to try, but next time I will ask for the costs of extras, such as the hummus up front. But, the customer service was a 10+ as the staff were extremely kind, apologetic, and had great suggestions. I will definitely return!

Went to Joyride for the first time with a couple of friends last Friday for happy hour and had a wonderful time. It is a unique and hidden gem nestled between Postino's and Federal Pizza. The food and service was amazing and I enjoyed all of the food and drink recommendations made by the servers. I definitely recommend the pineapple agua Fresca with vodka added, the chicken burrito, and the bottomless chips and salsa (the chips are a little salty, but can be easily washed down with a agua Fresca or another one of their tasty beverages!)   All of the servers made us feel welcome, wanted, and appreciated. I plan on returning again soon for another happy hour with friends!
