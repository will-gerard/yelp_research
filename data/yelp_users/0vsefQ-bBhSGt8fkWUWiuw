I've had nothing but pleasant experiences at this location. The staff has always been professional and curious, and the hotel itself is perfect for a quick weekend or a long stay.   The breakfast buffet rarely fails me, with a good selection and great service.   The bar is a great place for a quiet drink, or to meet friends and colleagues. The food is great, if a bit pricey (it is still a hotel after all, the food is never cheap)  I've enjoyed everything from their lobster BLT to their filet mignon. One of my favorite things is that they have a happy hour where they offer snacks such as chicken wings, mini empanadas, taquitos and other tasty finger foods.   The pool area is nice, and if it is your sort of thing, one can spend all day there. They even serve food and drink in the patio area.

The steak was good, but not particularly impressive at $40 per plate. I got the Surf and Turf special with scallops, and two 5oz filet. The filets were good, cooked perfectly, and great cuts of meat. Just not wowed. The real disappointment was in the scallops that came with the dish. For the class of the place, one expects a certain level, and those scallops didn't even come close.

Loved the place! I had some Pork roast awesomeness, and the chili-dip both really good. As tasty as the food was, there was way more than I could eat. We also got an unknown number of margarita pitchers that just kept coming. Needless to say, next time I'm in Mesa, this is a must visit!

Meh, it is fine - the food is inexpensive and quick. I'd go there again, but am not too terribly impressed with either the food or the service.

Great cheap Burritos, Tacos, and traditional Latin foods. The service isn't super fast, but fast enough. The food is seriously plentiful, and very tasty. buyer beware: food may be filled with outrageous amounts of meat! (in a good way)
