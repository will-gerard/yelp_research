I really don't like this place.  I had a burger with way too much fancy stuff.  I think I had an onion focacia bun and it just sucked.  Overpriced and not good.

I'm always a fan of food that can't be found anywhere else.  This restaurant has such food with their killer sandwiches.  A must like getting deep dish pizza in Chicago.

From what I hear this place is set in a restored house from 1913.  Solid pizza and the deli anitpasto was great.  What really stands out is the atmosphere.  It's near the Roosevelt district and it's a very chill place.
