Today we did what we call the "Aunt Chiladas Dreamy Draw Ride" at the end of heart thumping  leg pumping 40 min ride on road bikes, we go into the historic joint to hang at the bar with Marie. I drink tea, he drinks Corona Light. We don't eat. It's fun to envy the Chingalingas the workin' guys down the bar are scarfing. Good banter, lots of laughs and historic surroundings. Until next week, when we ride here again and inhale the scent of mesquite and homemade flour tortilla chips.

Sept 27th 2011  We moved to Downtown Phoenix about a year ago and have been on the search to find a nearby local bar place that really keeps us coming back.   Finally we stumbled on Hazelwoods on the right day,  met our new favorite Bartender Jessica and have come back at least 3 times a week for the last 3 weeks!  We are not easy to please . . .here are just a few of our favorite things:   Compliments Always First:   1. Jessica, Jen, Rachel Shelli really create a warm, fun friendly environment. We come first and foremost to see them.  They set the tone for fun and the patrons follow - we can always count on warm friendly smiles.   Our beers never go empty, and they always have a "no problem"  attitude.. . .  And Well at least until today when some jerk came in and razzed them they are a superb crew  . . (see below - this is a real kicker!)  2. The FOOD  - The cook(s) in the back really dishes up some killer meals! Wow - try the Nacho's there's nothing like em - filling, tasty, hot, and they go down so easy there's no self imposing guilt trip afterwards! The Green Chili is the heartiest and as if its a local natives family secret recipe.  - can't wait for it on a cold winter day!  The Breakfast offered only on Saturday and Sunday ALL DAY will blow your mind. Our Fav is the Old Pro for 6.49 is enough for two and includes 4 eggs, 2 sausage patties, 2 bacon slices, hash browns (you know how hard it is to find hash browns these days!) and biscuits and gravy!  The Cesar salad, rocks! Best in town - just ask em to throw some fried  chicken on it tossed in buffalo sauce on it and its a virtual orgasm in your mouth.   3. The TV's the sound system and the comfortable seating options as well as a patio make you feel right at home.   Complaints:  The only complaint  I have is . . . . believe it or not the OWNER!!!!!!  AT FIRST I THOUGHT HE WAS A CUSTOMER!!! He drove up in none other than a PINK car,  brought his dirty dog in -  who I overheard by customer sitting in the booth behind us -   later  took a shit and threw up in the back room.   He yelled  at Jessica regarding something that was or wan't on on the TV which made all the customers  in the nearby area nervous - he took the laughter out of the air and dissipated it immediately.  He  demanded service ordering food and drinks.  Jessica, Jen and all of us  patrons were really on eggshells then after he left - the room was heavy with tension.   This was our first  Drama moment here so far. We asked who the guy was . . a regular?  And a guy down the bar said "THE OWNER!!!!" OMG does he know how to demoralize  his awesome staff and turn his great bar into a hell zone for everyone.  It makes me not ever want to come back.  When I told Jessica this, she pleaded with us, telling us he doesn't come in that often and that she appreciates us and our business  and to please keep coming back.    I think we will cuz we love these bartenders and this place and the food - so if  Owner could just keep out, then we will keep on coming in!   I don't mean to be rude to someone I don't know but I am a business owner myself and have no respect for bosses/owners that bark orders and mistreat the people who make their business a success.  Without the people that support you/your business . . .  you would be nowhere.  I would like to see him and his dog try to make this bar roll the way these ladies do.   He owes his staff nothing but love as their performance is outstanding considering they have to overcome a badgering, negative overlord.  Whatever your name is . .  Congratulations you have stumbled on great people in a poor economy that take good care of you and your baby. If competition was more fierce and you were here everyday you'd be far less fortunate.  Sincerely,  Y.  Just a girl and her man who love this place!

We sure will miss Danny! He was really inspiring us to come back outside of one weekend morning a week.  ...Bummed! Were looking forward to new menu, special items he cooks himself and more creative music nights! Eventually we may just have to stop coming here...for certain if Jess ever leaves or gets fired like all the awesome mangers that have  tried to make this place fun. Dear Owner, Im NOT a fan of you.  This move takes you from 5 stars to 1 in my book.  It's common knowledge that  patrons return because of the people that make the place...bartenders, managers etc. So if one has common sense, it   seems  that this would be taken into great consideration prior to firing a superior individual who personally dedicate himself to a business.   The best bars find systems, great crew and keep them in place.  People come here for the people, not just the TVs. Even a church is just a building without the people.     Sadness and disgust  overwhelms the bar today by many of us who without explanation feel a good man was fired for no reason other than the bar owner must have been experiencing an emotionally unstable moment and is therefore driven towards sabotage.  The owners rep as a tyrant is all too well known but not understood or respected.  :(
