I love this place. After going to Richardson's for years, I could not wait for the Rokerij to open. My favorite meal is the Rokerij Steak. A perfectly cooked tenderloin with dungeoness crab mixed with jalapeno hollandaise on top. The wine list is great too.  If you are not in the mood for a sit down, you can always hang out at the bar, have a cocktail and order an appetizer.

Some of the best Italian food I have ever had. This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people, very inviting. The bar is small but fun to hang out at. The food is always fresh and delicious.  Watch out for Marcellino - he likes to push the truffles.

Great lunch spot. I don't usually try much on the menu because they have the best Tortilla Soup i have ever had. I get the soup and house salad with jalapeno ranch - awesome. The patio is great when the weather is good.

Great place to have dinner with good friends. Sit at the bar and wait for your table. I always order from the specials menu - never disappointed. Crowded every night of the week, but worth the wait. Great brunch as well. One of the best small neighborhood joints.

I try to make it over her for lunch at least once a month. The setting is so-so, but the smell and taste of the food make up for it. The bbq pork and chicken are very good, as well as the slaw and corn bread.

I have been going to Kandy for 15 years. Even though I live in Scottsdale and work in Tempe I make it a point to be at Snapdragon every 3 weeks. The salon it top notch and has a great atmosphere.

Just stopped over at Tipp's 88 for lunch, and I was very impressed. I was a frequent guest of Ichi Ban in my ASU days, and I noticed Tipps when having a sandwich at the Picnic Company across the parking lot. I have to say the food was great. The curry was very tasty, and the lunch menu was cheap.

Walk over to Cartel at least 3 times a week from work and love it. My office sits right in between a Starbucks and Cartel. I don't even hesitate to move towards Cartel. The coffee is extremely superior. The atmosphere is perfect to bring a laptop and get some work done as well.

Small little place on the border of Scottsdale and Tempe. I always order the Gyro and a Greek Salad, very good. The service is good and George always has good music playing.

Well, this experience was interesting. We walked up asked the host if there was anything available he said 30 minutes. We decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. Before we sat at the bar I asked the 16 year old taking names if i could put my name down just in case we wanted to sit at a table. She asked if I had a reservation. Uhm No. She said there was nothing available. By the way it was only 7:30pm. We found 2 seats at the bar. Behind us was about 7 open tables. Hmm nothing available? After about 10 minutes finally one of the 6 bartenders noticed us. My wife asked for a blueberry press - No blueberry vodka. Then she asked for Captain - Uhm no Captain. Finally an orange press. Clearly the bartender had no idea how to make one. I just saw Makers behind him, so to play it safe I asked for Makers. Didn't want to confuse him.   After this we decided that we would only order an appetizer. Dinner might seem too painful. So we ordered the Grilled Calamari. I have to say it was amazing. The Calamari was thick and grilled perfectly the artichokes and everything were delicious. We actually thought maybe we should just order dinner. Then the 15 minute wait until the bartender asked us if we were ok - so Check please!  From just having that one appetizer I have to say the food is great. The service on all ends was terrible. Not sure if I will attempt again.
