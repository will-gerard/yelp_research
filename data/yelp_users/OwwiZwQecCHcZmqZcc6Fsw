Ask for Tony.  He rocks.  The food is amazing.  This is the place to just ask for what they recommend.  Blueberry cocktails are awesome.  The dessert martinis are out of this world.  Super awesome experience.

If I could give a negative star I woud.  Dr Monroe has a God like complex.  As long as you don't question what he does then you will be fine.  We have been here a few times and you will wait 45 minutes to an hour with an appointment.  All the nurses have the most awful peraonalities.  If you care about having a positive relationship with your doctor....this is not the place to go.
