The ladies here are great, and they have been for sometime. Paige and the others are great stylists and they have a very dedicated clientele. I have gotten a cut and color here many times, and have brought in family and friends who all love the results.   The price is reasonable and actually lower than other places, such as Arizona Hair Co., and you will be a lot more satisfied with the result and experience as a customer. I would recommend this place to everyone.

I haven't frequented a lot of skin specialists, however my experience at this office was very positive. I purchased two different specials off of living social and went in first for a microdermabrasion and second for a photo facial. Dr.Wanters did a skin screening to make sure that I did not have any serious skin issues, and Adrienne performed both of my treatments. She was extremely friendly and ready to answer any and all questions that I had about the treatments.  The results of my treatments were fabulous and I have a major reduction in skin blotches on my forehead due to an overproduction of melanin. The photo facial also reduced a lot of the freckles on my cheeks and acne redness. I will most likely go again for a second treatment to completely remove the remaining blotches on my forehead.

Great for Dinner and Laughs all in one. Show up early for dinner and drinks before the show and enjoy drinks during the show. Have to be 21 for the floor, otherwise under 21 can get in and sit at the balcony right before the show. I've been here three times and enjoyed every visit!

This was my first time here and I really enjoyed it. My date and I got the flaming cheese and a large appetizer platter and we were full! I will definitely go again.

If I had a higher salary, I would shop here. I love this store, however the only reason I come here is if I am looking for something you can't get at a large grocery chain like a Fry's Marketplace.  They have a great wine selection, fine imported cheeses and the pastry counter makes your mouth water. When they are having a sale on steak I always buy it here.

In terms of quality at good happy hour prices, I give Sakana 4 stars. It is not the best sushi I have ever had, however I go here frequently with girl friends for happy hour because the sushi is good and we can get out of there full under $30 each, including beer and/or saki.   I recommend trying the flavored wine, it is surprisingly tasty. The service is always good and I am always greeted with a smile. At my last visit, the manager thought we hadn't left a tip and came outside to ask up if there was a problem with our server so that she could make sure that we were satisfied.   This place definitely cares whether or not you enjoyed your dining experience.

I went here for the first time for a first date and it was really good sushi and the service was great. However it was really pricey since we both got drinks. While I was there I asked about their happy hour specials. I went back during happy hour and was very satisfied by the food, service and price. My martini was amazing and I suggest the Marilyn Monroll.

I have been to RA a handful of times for happy hour, and was always annoyed by the loud music and crowd.    However, this time I went here for happy hour as a first stop for a Bachelorette party and I had a great time. The upbeat social atmosphere was great for getting the night started. The group ordered a ton of appetizers and rolls, and even a drink each, and we walked out at about $30 a piece. The elderberry mixed drink was especially good.  Normally, I do not pick this place for sushi happy hour because I don't like their quality of sushi and like quieter placed to relax with a friend or two. But if your going for a fun group atmosphere, this place is perfect. But only during happy hour, otherwise it is definitely not worth the price.

I agree with the other reviews on here that critique Crave for its slow service and disappointment with the food presentation. I too was left wondering where the waiter was and whether he forgot about us or not. My friend ordered the Gyro and it did not come with the usual toppings that you experience at other places, lettuce, feta and tzatziki. When we asked for tzatziki, it took forever for the waiter to remember we had asked for it, and we were charged for it. I did enjoy the white sangri however, which was very delightful.

I took my dad and family here for Father's Day and even though it was a holiday, we only had a 30 minute wait and the service and food was excellent. My dad and I sat in the bar area while we waited to be seated and had a martini and a gin and tonic, both of which were made strong and poured at our table.   My parents said it was one of the best steaks they had ever had and they were very happy that it was cooked exactly to order. My mom said she couldn't remember the last time she had had a steak that was actually medium well. I had the Alaskan King crab and it was also cooked well and served with butter sauce that was warmed at your table by a candle.   The service was excellent and every waiter there was aware of our table and needs even though they weren't our waiters. Best team work between hostesses, waiters, and management I have ever seen.

I am a sucker for Harkins. I grew up in the Phoenix/Metro area and all my fond childhood experiences of movie going include the "Harkins" experience.   I came here for the midnight screening of the last Harry Potter, and to my surprise, they opened all 16 theaters up over two hours early for the screening. In spite of the hundreds of children running around, the atmosphere made the movie experience all the more exciting. Staff and management were organized, helping to ensure that everyone got a seat, and having extra theaters"reserved" for those people who got jipped out of good seats because of the people who were "saving" seats for latecomers.The concession lines moved fairly quickly, considering the amount of people, and the bathrooms were kept clean.

I stopped in here after using my Yelpy app to help me find a place for coffee and breakfast that wasn't the Starbucks in the PCC. Finding places like these are why I love Yelp. That said, I was a little lost since they had just moved and Google maps wasn't updated yet, so I was happy that I had decided to just keep walking in a straight line until I found something.   And oh, I found something. The best breakfast burrito I've EVER had in my life. I don't remember what it was called, and it is not on their website, but it was full of eggs and vegetables and came with some hot sauce. The staff were very friendly and helpful since it was clear I had just stumbled into their shop. I was surprised when I tried to order a white mocha and their flavoring options were very limited, but the large vanilla late was not only pretty and made very deliberately to taste the way it did, it was quite tasty. It may have been shockingly bitter if you are used to ordering drinks with sugar syrups, but I had recently changed up my routine at my local coffee shop in Tucson to use sugar free white mocha so it was nice to mostly taste the coffee flavor in all its glory.  They were also apologetic that their square app was running slow since they were still getting their Wi-fi moved from their other location, and there were a few men deciding how to hang a fairly large red chandelier, although I thought it looked like cool art right where it was on the floor.   I was so happy with my find that I came back on day two of my conference and ordered the same coffee and a bacon and egg breakfast sandwich. Not only was it delicious with some tasty sauces, it was HUGE. Even though I tried my best, I couldn't eat the whole thing.

This place was really interesting, and the headset tour was different than most. Instead of listening to some boring lady talk to you, the headsets automatically changed music to the type that you were standing in front of. I really liked how it was arranged by countries and regions of the world. Took about an hour and a half, but I didn't read all of the information.

This place is a lot bigger than it appears when you first walk in. I went here for a waxing and was treated great by the esthetician and had an overall good experience. I will go here again.

It's Olive Garden, you should expect it to be the same as always. However, I always get the Eggplant Parmesan, and this time it was really bad. I told the waiter and to my surprise the manager came over and was genuinely interested in why I didn't like it this time since I always order it. She comped my meal since I didn't eat it. However, I left full since I did enjoy an appetizer, salad and breadsticks!

My wonderful Yelpy App helped me discover this place while at a conference at the PCC. Myself and four friends came here for happy hour after our conference and were not let down. We were immediately seated in the patio and greeted by a very friendly server. Since we had never been here he was very helpful in explaining the menu, happy hour options, and making recommendations. We took a little while to decide, but they were patient and accommodating. Between the four of us, we ordered "The Mule", "The Maid and "The Fix" as drinks and "The House Soft Pretzels," "The Artichoke Hummus," "The Zucchini Fritters," and a cheese plate to split. All were delicious. However, there is a reason that the Pretzels and Fondue are mentioned in 53 reviews! If you come here for nothing else, at least try these once in your life. Each of us ended up liking the others' drink and for our second round ordered two Mules and two Maids. Our waiters knew there were four of us, yet they only brought two pieces of bread with the cheese plate. This made us all look at each other awkwardly, and we had to wait a little bit before we got more bread, but this really wasn't a huge deal in the overall experience.  Yes, I switched our server from he to they, because all of a sudden it seemed like we had four different waiters. I'm not sure how they did it, but every time we needed something, any server would help us, bring us what we needed, and the other servers somehow seemed to know what the others had done. If this was just a fluke then it went over just fine, but if this is their serving concept, I recommend that they explain it when they approach the table. A lot of other reviewers have mentioned the awesome atmosphere, corner hugging location, and decor, and I must agree that this place has it all. Upon sitting, I immediately recognized the red metal chairs and asked if this was a FOX concept, because they were the exact same ones I had sat in at the newly redesigned NoRTH in Tucson. Now I see why they were trying to duplicate the look of the Phoenix location, it's pretty awesome.

I would not suggest this place to anyone. I went here with a group of friends, and afterwards we all felt sick for the next day even though we had all ordered something different. On top of that, our waiter was not very interested in having us be there. We ran out of drinks, had our order taken wrong, and while we were waiting forever to get our check I went to go to the restroom and she was sitting at a table eating with one of the other waiters. And this was on a Friday at 6:30pm.
