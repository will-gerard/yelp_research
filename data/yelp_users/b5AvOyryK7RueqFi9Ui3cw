Really good service as well as dishes and drinks at Happy HOur. The staff was extremely nice and helpful; moreover, very patient with us.  Dish: Chile Relleno -- Yes, 6/10 for a good solid dish Drink: Bloody Mary -- 4/10, its alright... I'll pass Fast and decent food. I would come here if I was hungry in the area.  Pros: Quality and staff Cons: Price for dishes are a little on the high side.  STARS: 3.75

The most horrible service I have ever experienced for a hotel; I wouldn't expect such a fine establishment to have horrible service. I shall not recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a great time in Las Vegas to come to this hotel.   The story, our room door would not open and so the following things happened over a 2 day period (we missed our shows [Money loss]) : 1. Replaced room card, this did not work - 30 minutes 2. Called maintenance, waited an hour outside for them to come, opened door - 1 hour 3. Called maintenance again, waited an hour outside for them to come - 1.5 hours 4. Talk to managers, they did not help very much - 1.5 Hours 5. maintenance came and did nothing but call someone else - 45 minutes 6. maintenance comes, the staff did not document anything and we waited longer - 45 minutes 7. maintenance door comes, replaces the entire door assembly. - 1 hour 8. Talked to front desk - 45 minutes  This had more to it but that was just the summery of what happened...  Just say no and go somewhere else. That is all...  PS. I hate writing 1 star reviews but when its deserved, I rate them appropriately.

Mmmmmm .....  That is all I said after a single bite of this luscious goodness that melts in your mouth with tons of flavornoids delivered straight to your palates!  This is a must! Do come here at least once if you are in the area! Chipotle Chicken is the one you want! Montagu is alright...:/
