Locally owned, AMAZING PRICES! Staff was on the ball and we were asked several times if we needed anything. The portion size was really impressive! I had plenty to take home and have dinner as well! You can't beat it! Two meals for about $5! Will definitely return! Highly recommended!

I love little spots like this! They have delicious authentic Mediterranean food. The staff is very attentive and friendly. They also have a little market inside where you can do some shopping. I've been here before and will continue to come when I'm in the area.

I've been coming to Organ Stop Pizza since I was a kid with my family. The organ music and atmosphere are unique and enjoyable, and I love coming now for those reasons...but the food....not so great. The pizza isn't anything special, not much better than a $5 frozen pizza, and the salad bar is lacking. If they stepped it up on the quality of the food I would probably eat here more often. 2 stars for the awesome entertainment.

My mom is from Globe and I've been eating Reynoso family Mexican food my whole life. This is by far the best Mexican food I've ever had. My family has explored outside of Reynoso family restaurants and I always leave disappointed. The green chili is wonderful. My go-to is always a bean burro enchilada style. Yum!

I've been coming to this pool hall for over 10 years and it hasn't changed! Great prices, specials and relaxed environment. They have plenty of quarter tables in addition to the hourly tables and a few video games scattered throughout. They do have a small snack menu also...nothing fancy but I order something almost every time I go. I'll keep coming here as long as they stay open!

I've been shopping here for a few years and this shop is the best. Fantastic prices, friendly staff, shelves full with great selection, open late. I'm always glad to support my local businesses!! Highly recommended!!

I enjoyed my time at this coffee shop. The barista was super friendly and the atmosphere is great. They have plenty of indoor seating that is nicely spaced and a beautiful patio as well. Prices are decent as well. Laid back alternative rock playing in the background. I'll be back.

Been coming here for a few years. Food is absolutely spot on. Delicious authentic Mediterranean at its finest. The service can be a little spotty at times, but that's not a huge deal to me. As long as the food is A+ but I know not everyone is like that.

I discovered Name Brand Exchange in high school and have been shopping here ever since. Amazing prices on good quality clothing. Lots of styles and colors to choose from. Shoe selection is extensive!! Some other accessories as well. Great local store!

This is one of my favorite Indian joints in the valley. I love that they have the buffet for both lunch AND dinner, and that they have the buffet divided into vegetarian and non-vegetarian sides. Makes it super easy for people watching their meat intake. Also, if you come for dinner they bring you the tandoori chicken out on a sizzling platter instead of letting it sit on the buffet all night.

Such delicious Mexican food! By far the best rolled tacos I've ever had anywhere in the valley. Their street tacos are also worth mentioning but not the best I've ever had. Salsa bar is always stocked with a variety of yummy salsas. I love their horchata as well. Also clean with nice decor.

I love small little local shops like this one!! All the staff was very friendly and asked us a couple times how everything was. They had great variety and the bagels were being baked fresh as we waiting for our food. I had the bagel with lox and cream cheese and it was amazing!

Ordered a pizza at 12:25am. 1:50am rolls around...still no pizza. Called asking what was up, they said the game let out so deliveries were running late. Not willing to offer a discount or anything for it running way over. Then they said they wouldn't be delivering the pizza. And the employee and manager were rude to boot. Terrible customer service. Have no interest in finding out the quality of the food. Won't be bringing my business here, which is unfortunate because I'm all about supporting local businesses.

Fresh and healthy "fast food!" Count me in! I came here for the first time with a couple friends upon their recommendation. I had the Man Salad because it was chock full of healthy protein (tuna, avocado, chicken) and oh man! It was an amazing FILLING salad for a great price! I also had an iced chai latte, my favorite "coffee" drink, and they nailed it! I'll certainly be coming here again

I've been meaning to check this place out for a long time. I was in the area and decided to stop in. The serving size is great for the price. The veggies were fresh and I liked the dressing as well. If I'm in the area around lunch time I will def be back.

I was a regular at the old location on Southern and Extension and I was totally heart broken when I drove by and saw it was closed down. Then a friend of mine excitedly let me know that they opened at this new location!!! YAY! I went right away and it was spot on just like at the last location. LOVE the egg rolls, and they always include the mint :) Also had pho and it was tasty and perfect. LOVE THIS PLACE!

Mediocre food. I had the buffalo chicken salad, which the menu said was served with grilled chicken but it came out with breaded, which I wasn't too happy about. Another member of our party ordered his son a grilled cheese sandwich which the cook burned. The kitchen messed up another of our orders by bringing out fries instead of coleslaw as ordered. The service wasn't that great either. Drinks went unrefilled for way too long. Waitress took forever bringing out a box as well. I've been to bar & grill restaurants with much better food and service.
