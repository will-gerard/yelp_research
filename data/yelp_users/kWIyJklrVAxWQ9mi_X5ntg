I grew up going to the San Diego Zoo and the San Francisco Zoo, yet I LOVE this zoo!!!  It's surprising large and there are so many fun things to do. For my first time there I got to FEED A GIRAFFE, ride on an ELEPHANT, pet a MANTA-RAY and chill in a cage filled with monkeys. Now this may not be very exciting for some of you, but In San Diego/San Francisco, you have to drop some money to do activities like that, not 5-10 dollars.  The food here is moderately priced as well, so you aren't spending an arm and a leg on a pretzel. So I felt very VIP when I was here.  I advise that you were something you are comfortable in walking in all day, clothes and shoes. Because there is a ton of ground to cover.  The staff here is awesome as well, very knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions you have.  I'm bringing everyone I know that visits from out of town to this place. As long as it's not in June, or July, or August.....really anytime that it's hot. Hahahaha

This place is one of the best Chinese food restaurants in the area. In my opinion, the atmosphere is a little janky, I prefer to just get everything in takeout, but the foo quality definitely excels. They deliver and you can even order via online. The food is reasonably priced AND is delivered PIPPING hot. I love the wonton soup and their BBQ pork chow mein. The only thing I wasn't really fond of was the house special chicken, it was REALLY dry. I'm wanting to try it again just because the sauce was amazing.

NOM NOM NOM, the greatest pizza in phoenix Forsure! I stick with the classic pepperoni and cheese, but the ingredients are fresh and the sauce is out of this world! I can't find anything like it. I've never eaten on location, always had delivery. You know this place is good when there usually is a 45-1:30 minute wait.  Now that I've finally read other reviews on this place...it looks like I'm going to have to be stopping in!

I saw something they were advertising on groupon which was for a cut, color and style for 59.00. I called the night before and left a message for me to get in ASAP since I was getting really bored with my hair. They called me around 9am to see if I could be there in an hour and a half. Hell yes! So i show up and absolutely fell in love with Brittany! Shes AMAZING! I told her to do whatever she wanted as long as my hair was darker, a little over an hour later I had the richest hair, it was healthy and short! I love the cut that she did on my hair as well!  Im so happy that I was paired with her as a stylist, I refuse to go anywhere else from here on out!

DONT. EVER. MOVE. HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The neighbors are all freaking crazy. like bat (you know what) crazy.   Let me tell you about them!  Our downstairs neighbor likes the BLAST his music until 4 am ... and I mean BLAST to the point when there are pictures FALLING OFF MY WALLS AND I CAN FEEL THE VIBRATION THROUGH THE FLOOR!!!  And our other neighbor is constantly drunk, unemployed and usually slamming things around or verbally abusing his girlfriend. I mean its bad. I sit on my patio with a glass of wine sometimes because Im nosey and want to know what happened between them that day. The other neighbor is a drug dealer. The kids that live down stairs run around completely unsupervised.   The pool there... yah, just don't. Maricopa County shut it down do to it being unsafe water to swim in and mind you, Maricopa County only checks apartment pools twice a year. So its probably a walking fest pool 90% of the year.   The bugs! Their are cockroaches that are living in the walls and come out of the vents! No matter what you do ... they paid someone to spray, that didnt do a damn thing.  They do a terrible job cleaning the apartment before you move in... like seriously, I should show you the ceiling fan. All the appliances are from the 70s, the cabinets look like a project from middle school shop, and when they told us it was "move in ready" it was not.. they had not painted the walls like they promised.   The people at the front office are cool though.

Tuesday was girls night so.....no entry fee! This is my second time coming to this place, the first time I was already pretty hammered, so this last time I felt I was sober-er at least enough to cognitively rate this place... and it still gets 5 stars in my book!  Being that I've gone to places in the past like "spearmint rhino" and other raunchy places I've learned not to expect much out of strip clubs. The girls are usually trashy, look a bit like they're working to feed their drug habit and look like they haven't worked out in months.  Yet, THIS PLACE! For 1 am on a Tuesday the girls were beautiful! I was surprised at how attractive everyone was and they were in great shape. Being a female, sometimes strippers get awkward with women, but these girls are friendly and seem genuine.  Now the routines... i think a few times I turned my head and said "how do you hang like that?" this place really validates that stripping should be an Olympic sport.  I'm still shocked at how cheap their lap dances are. SIDENOTE:, why do men like to watch you get lap dances? you go with a guy to a strip club and they want to buy YOU a dance. I'm fine watching from a distance, thank you.  I just have to awkwardly look like I'm into it while you're getting more enjoyment out of it than . Lets skip me, just buy yourself a lap dance. I'll yelp while you enjoy that for some time.  Anyways.  Being from California.. I had never been to a topless strip club that serves liquor... YES! Now I can drink while watching girls in white fishnets shimmying up a pole under a black light.. WINNING! God bless you, Arizona liquor laws.  I like the lounge/seating set up of this place, really comfortable and not too crowded, still have the ability to walk around without side-stepping between people.  The bartenders were great. very quick to assist, and friendly.  If strip clubs are your thing, check it out.

What's there not to love about a 5 dollar pizza made ready for pick up? Mind you, this review is based soley off the hot and ready pizzas, along with their crazy bread.  I must admit I've never ordered their chicken wings, deep dish pizza, etc. I like that there's a lot of parking at this location, they open at 10:30am and the employees here are always very cheerful an seem to enjoy their jobs. The crazy bread.... Oh the crazy bread! This is the best type of breadstick I have vet had. They are so soft and covered in buttery deliciousness. I can't resist picking up a bag of these things each time I come in. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 out of 5 stars is because the "hot and READY" pizzas sometimes aren't ready when you order them.

I Love this place! Its around the corner from my house and reminds me of the dive bars in San Diego.  Their happy hour is really cheap and they do karaoke every night, which my roommate loves. I could pass on that part. they also do trivia night and play every major league game usually.  definitely a spot to check out if you're in the area. Good for after dinner drinks, or as a meeting spot after work. The people that come here are all very social and everyone seems down to earth.  Their sliders are good but a little on the greasy side (buns covered in oil), but their tacos are to die for. They have two pool tables and video game machines, so you don't have to just sit around and drink, except that's what I like to do. Hahhaa will definitely be back.

This has been my routine Monday night for the past couple of months. When you head in later on in the evening they can give you 11 dollar unlimited bowling till close, or its like 6 dollars for shoes and 5 dollars a game.... what? Just do the unlimited. They do close early during the week, which I somewhat hate... cause I love to bowl late night but I guess that was a San Diego/San Francisco thing.   This location has really easy parking, with their own private lot but it does seem that it needs to be renovated a bit. Its very old looking on the inside and the carpets are a little trashed.   As far as shoes, lanes and balls... They have a good variety and the shoes always seem in good condition, I havent had that dreadful pair that you get and are actually scared to carry to your assigned lane......yet.   I really like the lady bartenders here. Its practically tradition to get a pitcher of beer for our bowling cause I SWEAR I bowl better when I'm tipsy. They ladies are always very talkative and offer different shot deals too! We paid one dollar to get these cool smore's shots? something tastey and delicious.   I dont think I would want to be here when it was busy though, they seem really short staffed, but I assume thats because its late night? I dont know. My review is strictly on Monday nights after 8pm. Haha

WONT EVER COME HERE AGAIN. The guy who works here named Nick is a total POS. We went in on Wednesday  at 8:45pm and wanted to bowl. We weren't apart of the bowling league that was currently going on, but came with 3 people that want a lane. Nick instantly said "I know the lane is available but I'm not going to put you in a lane where you're gonna piss off my league members." Our response was well, we know the etiquette of bowling (I've been on a bowling league for 6 years and know how to properly play a game) and NICKS response was "I'm not gonna risk pissing people off next to you.  Well guess what, I'll NEVER come back. Cause they have douchebags that work at the front and from a BUSINESS perspective, they are turning away customers. I will take the time to drive 20 minutes further to avoid discrimination. Just because I'm young doesn't mean I have little experience in bowling.  DONT. COME. HERE. Unless you are a "bowling pro" cause apparently that's the only way they respect you as a customer.

Came here right at 5pm when they opened to place an order for take out. They told me to sit and wait for a server. 4 different servers walked pasted me before someone asked if I was waiting for something. Yeah, to order. Placed my order and sat there for 25 more minutes and all of what I ordered was chicken fried rice. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? WERE YOU PICKING THE RICE IN THE FIELDS? I could of gone grocery shopping and had quadruple the portions all in 25 minutes! I was getting visually frustrated so one of the managers came over and said "can I get you something to drink while you're waiting?" "Is that going to get added to my bill? Yes? Then NOOOO.  After waiting for this damn rice for what felt like the damn prehistoric era I get my food and walk back to my job. I get in, open my bag and portion didn't even fill the box! It was literally flavorless, like the chef doesn't cook with salt, people or even soy sauce. I noticed when I left even after 5:30 there were still parties with 5pm reservations that had not been seated in an entirely empty restaurant. I don't even feel like I need to dine in here to know its a tragic and terrible place to go.  This is a NO NO NO NO NO x infinity for me.

RANT STATUS: ENGAGED   OKAY NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.  lets talk about this dreadful experience from the beginning just on the phone.  1. After repeating my order 3 times, where it was consistently repeated back incorrectly, she seemed to FINALLY understand the 4 things I ordered and asked for my name. I said it was JESSICA somehow that was changed to Claudia and then Miranda... WHAT!?!?!  When my friend went to go pick up our food for us... they were missing a whole burrito, still screwed up an order when I clearly said one of the burritos was with bacon ( they gave us sausage) AND I HAD TO WALK SOME GUY THROUGH THE ORDER AGAIN OVER THE PHONE BECAUSE IT STILL WAS INCORRECT Seriously. Its like speaking to a two year old.  So irritating.  So other than having to spend 20 minutes of my time to relay what 4 items off the menu I wanted we get out food... 4 minutes after my coworker was eating her food, she had to rush to the bathroom to throw up and had to be sent home early from work . This is not the first time this has happened to a friend of ours but desperate times call for desperate measures and we were giving this place one more shot, and yup, they are terrible.  DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION THEY SUCK.  End of story.

Actually a pretty good Nordstrom rack, its always organized which i appreciate when going into this type of store...  The deals on the shoes and business casual attire is what keeps me coming into this place. A must see for clothing and shoes! The employees actually work all off of iphones, so you can process transactions just about anywhere in the store.....prettyyyyy cooool.

So I feel like I might be a little harsh....but I came from San Diego and have had high quality fish and better service at a lot more places. Let me get started.  When we showed up for reverse happy hour on a weeknight I had a reservation which I showed up ready to announce to the host. We stood there for 4 minutes before the bartender actually asked if we planned on sitting, I said yes so he said he would go find someone to help us. After getting our hostess, I informed her of our dinner reservation and that we were there for happy hour. She then sat us without a happy hour menu and gave us an ordering sheet to fill out....without a pen or pencil. Not off to a good start RA. Might I add I've always been a little against commercial sushi restaurants, and so far...this was reinforcing the reasons why. BUT the server we then had was amazing! Very sweet and attentive, always asking if we needed anything else and if we had any questions.  ....The food was okay.  I had ordered a yellowtail roll and spicy salmon roll, both were fishy tasting. More than any other place in Scottsdale that I've tried.  My boyfriend I really enjoyed the Zonie roll, which was my favorite and the Las Vegas roll which was my boyfriends and I must say, has a great presentation. If you plan on coming here, sign up for their "hooked up" email list and get new menu updates as well as free gift cards.  I won't be returning, try the sushi at stingray across the street at Scottsdale Quarter.

The worst sandwich I have ever had in my life. And I thought it was pretty difficult to make a bad sandwich. I ordered a turkey with everything on it and it tasted like the brick food you carry in your emergency kits.  The bread was stale, the tomatoes/jalepenos/turkey had zero flavor and contributed nothing. I even tried to douse the sandwich in salt and pepper and it made it even worse. I was starving, it was 16 hours passed the last time I had eaten and I didn't finish half. I don't know why this place is packed,  But the only reason they get 2 stars is for their line service....they got people in and out relatively quickly. ....maybe I caught them on a terrible day, but I went out of my way to text people about how much I disliked my food.  I wish I would of just save a few dollars and gone to subway. NEVER. AGAIN!

Rant time. Okay, not everyone likes sports. So why the hell would every single tv have either espn, baseball, college or pro football on? The dodgers? Ew. And the Oakland A's? I don't care how far they are in the league... I don't want to watch it. Then UCLA or the Cubs game?  Dear 24, leave at least one tv on the news. I like being entertain with information when working out... And no, the kardashian update on E! News does not count. Also, why do they call them 24 hour fitness when you can't access it 24 hours a day? More like 18 hour fitness.  Honestly, planet fitness is down the street and it's half the cost for a month to month membership. I'm switching. Which this gym was like the Cali ones I'm used to. *sigh* The equipment is mediocre, but I like that the water fountain water is cold.  And I like..... Nope, that about covers it.

Came in on opening day and got in free if we showed up before 3pm.  My fiancé knew to order our all day ride passes before online and saved us some money. (The tickets pre-purchased were 50 for 2 instead of 60). Barbara who works for the fair was very nice and printed our tickets for us since we don't have a printer and we got in with ease.   All the rides were up and running with ZERO lines so we road each one 4-5 times. It was amazing. I had an awesome time.  Yes it's not the state fair, so it's small. But we anticipated this before arrival so maybe that's why we weren't as impressed.  There were quite a few shows, my favorite ones being the dance company performances, the magic show (where I got to participate as the assistant), the BMX show (super legit!) and the free petting zoo. Alpacas are now my favorite animal...even though they can be a little aggressive if you have food.  I was really inpressed with the award art ranging from Kindergarden to High School students. I wish I was that talented!   There weren't as many food vendors or food variety as I would of liked, but we had 4 dollar nachos which reminded me most of 7-11 nachos. Haha there were plenty of beer stands where you could order a 6 dollar beer, with the option of having a Kiltlifter which was cool for me to see that they were supporting local breweries.   The vendors can be obnoxiously aggressive, but I think that that's pretty standard at any fair.

This was my first time at the AZ State Fair and I had a blast! I recommend coming on a Thursday or Sunday (?) cause I believe those are the two days that you can get an unlimited ride wristband for 30 dollars. (Its definitely worth it!)  There were a ton of great shows, from the Bird show (I got to hold a parrot!) to the Hypnosis show (my fiance was selected) lol everything was entertaining. There were a TON of food options at typical fair prices 5-15 dollars on average. We tried the deep fried cheeseburger and deep friend mac and cheese (yum!). As for adult beverages there were a lot of options for craft beer, each stand was different which was great. They also offered things like Sangria and Margaritas.  I feel like we bounced around the park all day, we even shot some live zombie actors with paintball guns. and saw Sheryl Crow in concert...she was amazing!  I took the bus to this location to avoid having to pay for parking so Im not sure how much that cost/inconvenience it was.  I will definitely be back next year!

This is a cute little area!  I came here recently for a Lyft event where we had catered pot pies (delicious!) with great salads.  I had a hard time finding it at first, but the ambiance is wonderful.  Our event was actually out in the barn, which was a little too dark on the inside for my taste.. .but had a decent amount of room for a 50 person group.  The patio area outside the barn is beautiful, covered with lots of shade and the trees are all wrapped in lights with amazing lanterns. The patio also had a fountain with koi fish, which was a nice touch.  They have a lot of plants fenced off around the property and really does look like "a garden".  Consider hosting an event here!  I bet this place would be very romantic at night!

This is one of my favorite Goodwill's in the area but I'm not ALWAYS finding something great, but that's the risk of thrifting!  This place is actually really clean and the staff is friendly most of the time. I have found a couple of higher-end brand shirts for 3-7 dollars so you cant go wrong there. Like other reviewers have mentioned, their furniture items can be a little pricey so I come here mainly for the clothes and their book selection as well.  I cant wait to go shopping for my ugly christmas sweater!

The front desk staff has been very friendly and helpful, the service here is great. The hotel has a recently remodeled feel, the rooms still smell like new carpet. They are going for a very modern feel, which I thought was cool but my mom described as "funky". They have complimentary breakfast and free wifi in the rooms (BONUS!) and ample parking.  There was a significant amount of dust sitting on the picture frames, but most people wouldn't check there, I only did so cause I work in a hotel industry lol  But I would definitely recommend this place,  Also has a pool and hot tub!  I would recommend getting some type of grip in the shower, since it was slippery enough for me to fall... I think it's hazardous. Overall... Great stay!

I can't wait to come back to this place to just roam around for hours with a decent amount of money to spend. There is a plethora of new/used DVDs (blue rays too) that range from extremely recent to the classics. I was able to get one of my favorite 90's movies for 5 bucks and I can't wait to go back to roam through the 2 for $5 bins! This place also has comics and a wide selection of books. This is a great place to find gifts too if you have friends like mine. It's like a Spencer's but 10 times better. If you're looking to sell your stuff too, they do that! Just make sure it's in decent condition and still play-able.  So many CDS! There just wasn't enough time for be to go through it all.  Going back extremely soon.

So incredibly disgusting!!! When comparing this place to other Chinese food buffet locations in the area avoid this one like the Black Plague! Anything deep fried here I can almost guarantee came from a freezer and there was more fat than meat on any of my chicken that I picked up, after trying one plate I asked my boyfriend if we could leave because I was getting physically ill. The service is also terrible, it must be family run because there were random people sleeping at other tables while we there.....?!??!?  Also, it's the smallest buffet known to man kind.  20 minutes after leaving this place I was throwing up off the side of 19th ave, I wouldn't suggest anyone coming here.

This place is actually really awesome. Thy have plenty of computers to use, easy check out (with emailed receipts available!) and a decent selection of movies too.  I like this location because it's not swarming with obnoxious kids playing computer games when you come during "after school hours.  Also, the librarians don't seem irritated with you when you approach them with questions.  The only 2 things I will say... 1. I would say is they have a more-limited supply of book/movies in comparison to other libraries in the area. 2. Also, a lot of things I was looking for they had at the location...but we're marked as "being processed" so many things are neon returned but not promptly put back out on the floor, which is a tad bit frustrating. Still going to make this my "home" location for a library, just going to make sure I e-hold things before I come back and visit!

This place can really be a hit or miss and lately it has definitely been more of a miss for me lately. It is cool that it is a large place, and that they do have a lot of activities to par-take in like darts, pool, karaoke, punching bag arcade game, etc.  They do have an outdoor/indoor smoking area that can sometimes make the entire venue turn smokey, which is a bit irritating.  Ordering drinks can be a drawn out process and the servers/bartenders tend to have a huge attitude problem, but they do have a lot of specials and I like their shot board as well! You spin the wheel for 4 dollars and then whatever you land on you drink, which can be scary with some of the options on there, but equally hilarious.  Some people apparently like the food here? We've ordered the pizza which compared mostly to the 7-11 instant pizza. Their fries were also overcooked and burnt. Yuck.  This isnt my first choice place, but if a large group of us is going out I'll suck it up and still have a good time.

Okay before someone writes on my review "well it's a walmart, what do you expect?" Let me clarify that this review is on service, communication between site and store and employee knowledge. It has nothing to do with people wining about corporate America "those mom and pop robbers" or whatever else people automatically despise walmart for. So if you make any little snide comment like that after reading this, I may have the urge to punch you in the throat. READY RANT? SET RANT? RANT GOOO!  So after recently crashing my car, I learned that it would take me 2 1/2 - 3 hours to get to work and back from work. I decided... Let's get a bike! So being that I need the bike... TOMORROW. I look online at walmart.com there's a little signal that says "pickup today!" I'm thrilled! I can pay for it and pick it up tomorrow so I can bike straight to work. NOT!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for it, they took the money from my account, gave me a "pick up today" barcode to show to customer service and I should be happily on my way......HAHAHA  I show up, show them my phone. The girl just looks at me and says go to jewelry someone can help you there. 1st, hello rude girl. I don't know walmart like the back of my hand like you do, so where is that? She just points. Okay, fail one walmart customer service. I'm going to speed this part. After speaking to 6 different people who have no idea where this bike is or what's going on, while someone says "hold on" and they disappear for 45 minutes without telling me what they were doing or that they would be back, I find out that they don't have that bike, and it's on back order.  Um, well why would it be pickup now? "I don't know". OMG, so helpful! I ask if I can just exchange it for one they have on property, they said no. After throwing a fit and speaking with management they were able to override a return, which doesn't deposit until 48-72 hours. I didn't have enough money in my account to get one on site, so I had to leave empty handed. AND to top it off, I purchased a warranty with the bike, which they didn't return! So after doing it myself online they tell me it won't be returned for 2 BILLING CYCLES. WHAT?!?!?! Worst customer service ever for a corporate company. I've written numerous letters and left complaint messages for their customer service line and have received zero response. SO yelp it is!  The only employee I liked was from Wisconsin, I don't remember her name, but she was cool.  End rant.

This is the cutest, most low-key place in old town. I was invited to meet some people here and I must say, ITS HIDDEN. So incredibly difficult to find, but this is why it's amazing and not filled with the douchy crowds of Scottsdale. It's very low lighting, so an amazing ambiance. Also, how can you ever go wrong with live music?  They have nice group seating (for larger groups) and it's not too loud to just have a nice conversation. You must try the wine, don't be one of those people that goes to a wine bar and orders a coors light. Also, ask your server questions. They're incredibly knowledgable on the menu and can reach you a thing or two.  I would say that for dress, you want to be a little fancier vs. casual. I've seen both, but think it's too nice of an atmosphere to be in shorts and flip flops.

So this has been one of the best meals I've ever had, yet I have some constructive criticism.  PROS: 1. The food is to DIE FOR. The Stenson salad is delicious and the perfect appetizer to split. The truffle mac and cheese is so gooey, i wish there was more of it to share. I had the special, which was a 20 oz. ribeye steak. IT WAS HUGE. Also came with asparagus and this great mashed potatoes. It was seasoned perfectly, it wasnt till halfway through they give you some delicious sauce to pour all on it. Yet, you really dont need it!  2. The servers are very friendly and well seasoned employees, they DEFINITELY know what youre talking about.  3. They do wine flights? Need I say more? Plus, they have one of the most eccentric wine lists, it would take you at least an hour just to read each one. Some offered only by the bottle.  4. They gave me a free shot for my birthday, delicious.  ------------------------ CONS:  1. The layout of the place, its kind of cramped, especially when you are trying to maneuver around people trying to get to the bathroom. 2. The food service, while amazing, was slow. For 2 appetizers and 3 entrees being ordered at the same time, the entire service took 3 hours. It was fine for our party, but not suggested if you are in a rush.  3. A litttttle on the pricey side, while the food was amazing, you cant get an entree and an appetizer for under 50 dollars per person here. Just to warn you, then again, it IS scottsdale.   TIP: Make a reservation. On a tuesday night, there wasnt one empty table in sight. people were sitting at the bar just to get some time of meal service.   One of my new favorite american places!

Came here on a Saturday night at about 10pm, they weren't really busy but we my boyfriend and I did pay 10 dollars per person, per game. We used to frequently go to the AMF in North Phoenix was significantly cheaper (maybe because we were apart of the late night crowd?)  If it weren't for the price...I would give them 5 stars.  They're located just off of Thomas and Scottsdale Rd, so it's not too far if you're coming from Old Town.  It's the closest bowling alley that I've seen to have a night club environment. They play top 40, have music videos playing over every other lane and glow in the dark bowling pins.  I had a few beers here and ended up dancing instead of sitting when it wasn't my turn lol Will definitely come back, I'm going to look into their week night specials because I read something about all you can eat pizza....and I love pizza. Hahaha

I've never been to a RA, but my boss raved about how good it was, I figured I would come and try it for dinner.  The good: the ambiance. Its very downtown chic/trendy, with the dark lighting and I love the outdoor patio area, especially when the weather is perfect outside.  The bad: The food isn't impressive, especially for the cost. The rolls are small and have more rice than meat, the food doesn't taste.... the most fresh, but maybe I set myself up for failure being that I'm from San Diego and now.... in the desert.  The crispy roll wasn't crispy, more... the opposite of crispy. The ugly: UGH, their service! I walked in to meet a party, and it took the gossiping hostesses at least 3 minutes to look up and ask if I needed something.... um, no, im standing here to listen about how you got so drunk you made out with the busser.  Also, after being seated.......How many times do I have to order a beer? And our servers name was something like Paris? Britain? Some type of location. Our food was brought out staggered, so we couldn't all eat together (10-15 minutes apart). Our glasses were never filled in a proper amount of time and it was just .......terrible.    If you MUST try this place, come to their happy hour, even though it isn't even THAT impressive. Actually, just keep walking.

My boyfriend demanded that we try this place....... Still terrible for all the same reasons.  I only would come here if my life was threatened unless I complied.

Was taken here on a date for dinner.and the ambiance is beautiful. Since it was a nice night out, we chose to sit out on the patio (heat lamps are always a plus). I really wish they had lights on the course, so you had somewhat of a pretty view when eating dinner, im sure this would be a great place to have dinner during the sunset.  I hate the corn chowder as an appetizer, and it was PHENOMENAL. Being that my date was a scottsdale resident, thats what he stated was the best on the menu.  I also got one of their wraps, it was a crispy chicken wrap with honey mustard, bacon, lettuce and wrapped in a spinach wrap (if I'm remembering correctly) .  I wasnt 100% satisfied with my meal, to be honest with you.  The chicken was a little dry, the bacon and cheddar were lacking, but the honey mustard sauce and the spinach wrap were great!  I wish I would of tried the new menu that the server told me about. darn.  but if youre a golfer and you come by this course, i would check it out. Take the recommendations given by the servers though.  They know what they are talking about.

Some of the coolest things:  1. ever-rotating beer list so you have an awesome ability to try something new every day that you walk in there.  2. They have board games to keep you entertained 3. The people that work here, know their shizz and are always willing to answer questions.  4. They have a HUGE fridge of beers to take home 4a. The carry small-brewery beers, Alesmith is one of my favorites and I miss living in San Diego and going to their brewery directly. 4b. You can make your own 6 pack 5. They have darts  Only thing I don't care for is the pricing. It's rather expensive for a pint compared to other breweries I've been too. But the beer is pretty much worth it.  Just don't go here planning to get buzzed. Your wallet will leave in pain. Or maybe I just have a high alcohol tolerance. Or both. Or whatever.

This place is pretty cool. Yet I have some dislikes. It took us 15 minutes after sitting at the bar for the bartender to ask if we wanted something to drink (2 occasions) .....and they werent busy, but you could tell they had relationships with the regulars which as taking precedence over someone who just stepped in the bar. After asking what the happy hour was.... (which is all day on Tuesdays) we decided to just order a beer on draft. Even though we later discovered the deals were poorly explained by the servers/bartenders and better explained by the fellow regulars. We decided to order food before the fact,  my boyfriend got the hot wings and they were terrible. Incredibly dry, had black burn marks from the stove/bbq that was obviously heated too high before cooking them. They had very little sauce and were overly unimpressive. Flavorless and crunchy, yes, crunchy.  WingStop blows these people out of the water, sadly....  even though this place is labeled as "pub" food. I would suggest they remove these off their menu. just to continue their business.   one REALLY good food, the only one i liked, was their mac'n'cheese. Its not for the faint of heart though. You have to love some SERIOUS cheese, which i do. I was full after half a serving. I would get this to go if I could, but, not going to sit at the bar for 30  minutes for someone to bring me a menu for takeout. (The people behind me complained of that 30 minute wait time....) while i sat waiting for someone to order my beer, 25 minutes after giving menus, when I specifically stated beer was the only thing I'd be ordering from the bar.   Service needs severe work. Yet they seemed to have a few regulars who seemed to fawn over the bartenders.... asking them to try on their sunglasses and give them hugs across the bar. I've worked in a bartending community, just because 2/45 of your customers are trying to screw you and give you $50 tips on a $10 dollar tab does not make you a good bartender. It makes you an inattentive flirt, focusing your attention on creeps and actively choosing to ignore everyone else. Ive had to on (3 different occasions) throw my hand in the air like an elementary school student, to get someones attention. and it wasn't immediate either. more-so a mild workout.    I only come here for trivia night (Tuesdays you can win a $30,$20,$10 gift card), because i feel like the terrible service and basic drink specials aren't worth the wait.  Plenty of other places in the area to direct your hard earned money towards. Sorry guys, yet, not really sorry.  Basic.    Go somewhere worth your money. This has just been consistently disappointing.

The California burrito and chimichanga are the best I've experienced in Arizona so far.  They also have awesome salsas which I seem to grab way more than I need when I'm there.  My only complaints are going to be the lack of seating, the length of time it takes to get your food sometimes and the clerk can be extremely rude.  So I've chosen to get it to go and make sure I'm not on a time restraint when picking up food here.  Also, the burritos are smaller than the ones I'n used to, but they're cheaper too!

I'm only giving this Jack in the Box 4 stars because the dude that works there sometimes slips us free things for no reason. Like a Siracha burger or puts fries in the bag and adds an extra scoop. Why? I don't know. But he'll mention its in the bag when we leave, so its not an accident. But I shall not ask questions. Just eat my deliciously free 7 dollar burger with my favorite hot sauce on it.   Or because when we want to ride our bikes through the drive-thru, sometimes they don't mind! I'm pretty sure thats illegal, but yay jack in the box! Did I mention they give you dog treats if you ask for them?  Actually I like this jack in the box now that I've written the pros, I would give this Jack in the Box 5 stars is they were consistent with the quality of the food they produce. One night my Homestyle Chicken Sandwich will look like something out of commerical and other times I'm like WTH IS THIS!?!?!   Or for the stingy lady with the buttermilk ranches. Listen, If I order 6 different entrees, I deserve at least 6 buttermilk ranches. Quit trying to hold out on the wealth.. I'm pretty sure they don't deduct them from your paycheck.   That is all for now.

This place is preeeety good I must say! I've only ordered their delivery but keep in mind it was so HOT when it was delivered that I burned my mouth on the chicken trying to eat it. Now THAT is impressive. Originally we decided to order from this place because I was so hungover and just wanted some wor wonton soup, unfortunately they didn't have a wonton soup that was seafood free so I went with other choices. After reading the reviews my boyfriend and I ordered the gang pang chicken which I will forever remember because it's so similar to gang bang. Anyways. It was pretty good! The breading seemed a little soggy to me, but that could be because of the delivery. The flavor of the sauce was the perfect spicy sweet flavor I wanted.  But my favorite? THE GARLIC CHICKEN! Why did I not see this being reviewed?! It's so bomb, especially over white rice and I will forever love any Chinese dish that comes with water chestnuts and vegetables. MUST TRY!  Another dish that was great was the pork chow mein, I mean, it's not as good as the kind I've had in China Town SF, but it's the best I've had in AZ.  If you order (I believe) 20 dollars or more you get free crab puffs and they are DELICIOUS, like hide from the person you're sharing a meal with kind of good. What I didn't like....the hot and sour soup. Way too much sour. I scooped the meat pieces out and gave it to the dogs.    Nonetheless, I'll be coming back. Probably for lunch cause the deals look a lot better than dinner.

Everything is pleasant here from the people to the ordering to the taste of the food.   I've had a Philly Cheese steak in the heart of Philadelphia and it didn't even come close to the heavenly sandwich found here at Delfalcos.Also, its HUGE! I couldn't finish mine but it was even good heated up the next day. I cant wait to come back to try their pizza and some more of their salads.  They also have a large selection of wines, pastas and various other snacks so Its a great place to do some shopping for home while you wait for your food to be prepared.  The owners are great, really cant wait to come back for more!

I was actually surprised how much I liked staying at this place despite the negative reviews. I've stayed at multiple places on the strip and ONE this place doesn't actually smell like cigarettes and old people the second you walk in, giant plus. The check in can be a little long, but just apply for an Mlife card and you get VIP check in (you can apply online or in the casinos). This is one of the more kid-friendly hotels on the strip with the whole "castle" appeal and an arcade downstairs called the "Fun Dungeon". We spent some time gambling for free drinks then going downstairs to play DDR and Air Hockey, like all the cool 20-something-year-olds do. Hahaha  The pricing is really great too. We paid 63 dollars (not including resort fees) for a 2 queen bedroom with a great view of the Luxor and Mandalay Bay. Tower two is a bit nicer, just because it's the newer tower of them all. They do offer smoking and none smoking rooms.  Parking here can either be Valet or self parking, I felt the parking lot was safe enough to stay in, and it was free too! You do have the ability to ride the free tram to get to either one of those hotels quickly, or there is a quick walkway to get on the strip. I love that this place has Dicks last resort... A hilarious restaurant to check out if you've never been to one, you have to take everything they say with a grain of salt, but they do have a great happy hour! I'll definitely be staying here again, had a great time.

OMG I LOVE THIS MALL.  Call me a girly girl, but I love to shop. WARNING YOU: do not come here for a "quick tank top" stop. cause its physically impossible to spend less than an hour here.  I walked into one store to pick out a top, but that one store took a half an hour to walk to through the parking garage. They have valet and a lot of great restaurants around, with a multitude of store.  I'll be coming here again. frequently, actually.

So when working at a hotel, when people ask you where the best places to hike are....if you've never been, you feel like A. a liar if you tell them a specific location is GREAT when you've never even driven past the area or B. like someone who doesnt know how to do their job. SO, last weekend... I decided to fix that.  Except, I dont know why I chose the weekend, it seemed like everyone and their mother wanted to go hiking on a Sunday at about 10am. The parking sucks, I must admit, but if you plan on doing a somewhat challenging hike (for not hikers) then you shouldnt be upset with having to walk an extra .5 to get to the start of the trail.  It seems like people of all ages do this hike, from 5 year olds, to retired individuals.  Then again, this is why I hate hiking during busy times (no offense). I dont like feeling rushed by people behind me or being held up by people in front of me. I felt like i was constantly standing out of the way to let people pass me, just because i was being self concious that I was holding them up. lol Anyways, the hike in general is beautiful, the beginning of the hike looks over the Phoenician resort and golf course, so as you climb, you get great views. It was a little muggy when I went, but I bet the views would be the greatest after light raining, just to clear all the debris in the air....at least thats when you get the best views in San Diego! The beginning of the hike you just feel like you're on a stair-stepper haha but you can get great views rather quickly, I snagged a couple panoramic shots. The best part of this hike is that after you start to get REALLY winded and are climbing in the sun, the mountain sort of levels off for a minute IN THE SHADE. Its like someone planned this. The very end of the hike is fairly steep, so be careful with your footing.  I would say hiking shoes are preferred on this hike, cause of all the loose gravel. I saw a few people coming down the mountain with bloody knees and I also bit the dust quite a few times myself.  There were Bee Hive warnings everywhere, which I thought was strange. But if you are in moderate shape, I think this is a great hike to do. I hiked it leisurely in about an hour and 20, but that was stopping to take pictures and relax for a minute.  If definitely is do-able. I cant wait for the other side to open up! I want to go!

Came here while a friend was visiting (plus I had a 50 dollar gift certificate....SWEET!) The food was AMAZING. But I'll start back from the beginning.  We showed up and parking was terrible, but luckily...free Valet! Score! We valeted the car, and since we had a reservation...; were taken straight to the table. Whatever you do, get a reservation. This place was packed and is ALWAYS packed on the weekends. MAKE A RESERVATION, unless you like living dangerously. I just cant wait when I'm hungry.  The crowd here is older. Um, much older. My friend and I came in our mini dresses, headed to old town scottsdale afterwards and everyones faces were like 0____o hahahaha The average age here had to be 55.  They have an extensive wine list from all over, also, a lot of smaller wineries (which I liked).  The bread basket here is amazing, and thats coming from the girl who loves any kind of carb. Its an assortment of breads.  I ordered the salmon which was cooked to perfection and my friend and I split the garlic mashed potatoes.  I WISH I COULD OF SWAM IN THEM. The best mashed potatoes I've ever had.

I was taken on a date here for a late dinner and the place is great!  I love the ambiance, and the lighting is perfect for date night.  The male servers are hot. like really hot. hahahah We started off with the guacamole and salsa is better than I've had a most restaurants.  I ordered the grilled swordfish tacos, which was labeled as "guaranteed best in town" um, that couldnt be more true. The best swordfish tacos I've ever had, and the servings were HUGE. If it wasnt a first date, I would of took a picture of my dish. but i didnt want him to know about my yelp addiction just yet. cause i mean.... i've definitely got a problem. hahaha a must try for dinner!  I really want to come back for brunch on the patio though.

I have done some very ungodly like things at this place. And I must say... it can go from dead to PACKED in 30 minutes, its rather amazing.  I've only gone to Zuma's on Monday nights (I work at a nightclub, so those are the only days we have off) and its still pretty poppin' for Mondays, plus you have Chris Villa as a DJ on Mondays, so how could you go wrong?   I also came here for Saint Patricks day which was great., they had 5 dollar shots of jameson (my favorite) and green beer! One of the only places on Mill that didnt have a cover which is always a selling point for me.  *SQUIRREL* Returning to my review..........  GETTING THERE.  I live in North Phoenix so its a pain in the butt to get down to Mill, especially when I know I'll be drinking and parking can be less than favorable. Well, if you park at I want to say University and Mill (right next to firehouse?) theres a student parking lot with visitor parking too! I believe after 10pm you dont have to pay for parking till the morning, so its a smart way to get out of those meters. And btw, when I left my car parked in that lot for 2 days cause I couldnt find a ride back down to mill, I returned to a ticket on my vehicle..... SAD FACE. When I looked at the fine total is was 0.00... HAPPY FACE!  DRINK. DRANK. DRUNK.  You can get these ridiculously large drinks for 10 dollars, its like a personal pitcher of liquor. I cant remember what these damn things are called...but theres a chalkboard above the bar that describes the different ones you can order.   I always run into promotion girls here, which is also cool. Who hates being given free alcohol and merchandise? I mean, my Wild Turkey bottle opener keychain has been a lifesaver multiple times.   ONE LAST THING...... Who is that ridiculously handsome bartender that works there? If you've been there... you know who I'm talking about. Hes like 6 feet tall and resembles a Ken doll. I think half of my income has gone to him in tips just hoping to get a wink. My mouth waters! yum yum yum.

The brisket and Mac and cheese..... YUM! They slow cook the brisket for, I believe, 18 hours and it's so incredibly tender and flavorful. The Mac and cheese also has  quite a few different cheeses... Including velveeta? YES PLEASE. Personally, I think the cornbread is a little dry and the steak sandwich was just a huge disappointment. I really don't think that one slice of garlic bread and a hunk of steak makes a sandwich. And yes, it's ONE slice of garlic bread... I just don't see that as a sandwich. The mashed potatoes are great, make sure you get extra gray cause that's the best part. If you want something as an appetizer, happy hour is from 4-8 and their 50% off... The brisket quesadilla and spinach artichoke queso dip with garlic bread are the best ones on the menu if you ask me. Give this place a shot, it's got great reviews for a reason. Just don't get the steak sandwich. Hahahah

Some of the freshest seafood in the downtown scottsdale area. I would definitely stop here before the Art Walk on Thursday night, plus the ambiance is unbeatable for a date night restaurant. I don't like oysters, but however they were prepared here.. tasty! The calamari and jumbo shrimp cocktail.....great choices.  The fresh baked bread here is too good to be true. I'm all about fresh bread and I must admit, I was full off the bread before most of the appetizers. hahah I really want to come back here for a full meal, I especially want to try the salmon special. Check out their happy hour! You'll be able to eat the most and save the most money that way. Its to die for.

Okay, if you're in Vegas eating on a budget.... I would HIGHLY suggest stopping in for at least breakfast! I think we paid 3.95 for eggs, your choice of either ham, bacon, or sausage, potatoes and fresh tortillas. How do you go wrong with that? Everything tasted delicious too... Maybe that's because we started drinking at 6am... Hahaha  They do have 99 cent bloody marys during breakfast too... So it's definitely a smart spot for a breakfast adult beverage.  It can get packed in here, but even so, we were greeted quickly. Our food took a little longer to get to us, but for a complete meal under 10 dollars including tip out you can't be too picky. Making this a pit stop every time in Vegas!

So, I think I just found my new favorite seafood place, and its only 10 minutes from work. SCORE. Lobster mashed potatoes, Lobster mashed potatoes, Lobster mashed potatoes. The best thing you can order, I swear. You have to order this if you are a fan of mashed potatoes.  If you like a little spice.. the jalepeno tuna sashimi. Its the highest quality fish I've had and its got a mild spice to it. delicious.   They also have a great wine list.  I loved the live music and the song choices are amazing. Oh, third eye blind, john mayer, and dave matthews band? I think I'm in love.

this was the first Japanese restaurant I've tried out in Arizona, and I was pretty disappointed with the quality. I'm from California where the sushi is really good. this place is expensive for sushi quality I would get out of Safeway deli. We were the only ones in the restaurant which should of been warning sign number one. The only really good tasting sashimi was the salmon.  The location is decorated in a really strange way and definitely needs to be renovated. It's also very small. Overall, go somewhere else. Not worth it.

Extremely close to Scottsdale Quarter, so if I'm in the area I always have to hit both locations.  The have an excellent fountain here that the kids can play in during the day if it's hot enough and they also do awesome events each season.  During Christmas I know they had Santa there and complimentary hot chocolates which is an awesome and free family event. Also, how do you go wrong with an awesome book store? I waste my afternoon in there weekly.

This place is right across the street and has a bunch of great finds.  I live across the street so will walk over every once in awhile and buy something for our house. They have a ton of great bed sets, high quality sheets that you save a ton of money on buying here rather than going to a Macy's/bed bath and beyond type place. They also have some great finds for dog lovers, I've bought my puppy crate, food bowls and leashes here and saved a good chunk of change instead of going to petsmart  The customer service here is superb, I always am welcomed at the door and asked if I need help finding anything while I'm there.  Whenever I come here I usually walk out with buying something I didn't know I needed. Lol  Will always come back!

I think that some of the items at Safeway can be a tad more expensive than what you can get at other market places, but the food is always fresh.  The employees here are great, always asking you if you need something.  The lines can get a bit ridic on some evenings when you go to make a quick stop to grab something for dinner.  I must admit, I'm sad that they changed their free sandwich deal to being more like a coupon instead of automatically deducting it from your bill, only because my dad and I both used the same number, and I would always redeem the sandwich when I knew it was going to be free. heeheeeheeheeheee  This place is very convenient, since its across the street from my house.  Will be coming back!

OMG I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE! Btw, Did I mention that Julia Baker is amazing? I didnt? Well SHE IS. So down to earth with a great sense of humor! She definitely has an interesting life story.  I think this is a great place at the Biltmore to stop by for a bit of indulgence in chocolate, girl talk and espresso.  They offer free wifi, which is great if you want to stop by and do some surfing of the web. If I lived in the area, I would stop by here to do homework.  The ambiance is girly, but very European as well. Very similar to how I would view a cafe in France.  The chocolates here can be a little pricey, but they are to die for. I would suggest the red velvet cake dipped in dark chocolate. Its amazing.  I'll be stopping here every time I come to  Biltmore Fashion Park!

Came here to get a flu shot, the pharmacy technicians were very kind and knowledgeable. From check in to injection the total time was 11 minutes, definitely worth it!  Now they were out of 20% off coupons for store purchases after you get your flu shot which was a bummer but the tech informed me they could manually remove the discount up front.  Cool, so I decided to pick up some makeup purchases (which they were lacking lots of stock) and after she interrogated me as though I placed a fake bandaid on my arm, after showing the injection receipt and flu shot vaccination medical ID numbers she reluctantly took 13% off the transaction. Like really? Afterwards I questioned her and she said "take it or leave it". Like WOW how rude!! I had biked a total of 30 miles so far for the day so i didn't have the energy to argue, but SERIOUSLY?!?  When I walked out, chuckling to myself at the terrible customer service, a 60+ year old man came out after me and said "was your clerk as much of a b&;@$ as mine?" YES DUDE. That interaction will make me never shop there and deter everyone I know from going there. WALGREENS all the way now!!

8 dollar pitchers Chess/checkers, Backgammon, scrabble, pool, darts and even the punching bag game. On Sundays they have all the games on and free BBQ burgers/hotdogs.  Send them a text when you're first there for a penny drink and on the weekends sometimes they give you 25% off when you ride your bike.  This is my favorite place on the outskirts of Old Town, dirt cheap with the friendliest people.  I will stay coming back to this place!

The little kid in me loves coming to this place for some heavy gaming. Whether it be racing horses, cars or playing basketball and some classic arcade games...this is the spot to come.  They're drinks aren't the cheapest, but buying 20oz beers is probably your best bet. They give you a rechargeable token card which can be dangerous since you don't realize how few tokens you have left until you need to buy more. Lol but it's nice because you can store that card in your wallet if you're maxed out on gaming for your next visit, the card doesn't expire.  The guy that works the front counter where you buy your coins is really sweet and tries to get you the best deal for what you're looking to do while your there. (His name is Alex I believe?) While they do have a bar it's a cool place to take kids for some gaming during the day. Haven't had a chance to check out their restaurant unfortunately, but maybe I'll check that out at the next visit.

Yummy! We stopped in for a drunken bite to eat at the Luxor on our way back to Mandalay Bay. The sandwiches were HUGE and I was impressed by the freshness of bread and meats. They are extremely generous with their servings of meat, if you look at the picture I took.. I couldn't even fit my mouth around it! It was delicious! I would definitely go back.

This was my first time at the AZ State Fair and I had a blast! I recommend coming on a Thursday or Sunday (?) cause I believe those are the two days that you can get an unlimited ride wristband for 30 dollars. (Its definitely worth it!) There were a ton of great shows, from the Bird show (I got to hold a parrot!) to the Hypnosis show (my fiance was selected) lol everything was entertaining. There were a TON of food options at typical fair prices 5-15 dollars on average. We tried the deep fried cheeseburger and deep friend mac and cheese (yum!). As for adult beverages there were a lot of options for craft beer, each stand was different which was great. They also offered things like Sangria and Margaritas. I feel like we bounced around the park all day, we even shot some live zombie actors with paintball guns. and saw Sheryl Crow in concert...she was amazing! I took the bus to this location to avoid having to pay for parking so Im not sure how much that cost/inconvenience it was. I will definitely be back next year!

I love this trail, it's especially good for early morning hikes with my dogs. It's not too steep and doesn't require an immense amount of rock climbing at any point... So my little chihuahua and dachshund are able to do it without any problems. My favorite part about this hike, is going off trail, you get great views of the entire phoenix area and you can do some serious rock climbing if you want.  Like everyone else has said, keep an eye on which way you came from.....you can get lost and it's a pain in the butt trying to find your way back.  I like this trail cause I rarely see it getting very busy (unlike camelback) and it seems like a peaceful/mild hike.  Definitely one I'll be coming back to.

Came here to see a movie at about 12:50ish in the afternoon during the week and was excited to see that the matinee prices actually run till 6pm? Isnt this much later than other theatres? I thought they only ran till 3pm.  Anyways. 14 dollars for 2 adults isnt bad at all.  I'm not sure about the cost of any of the snack foods cause I do it the way my mama taught me. I stop by QT before, get slurpees and candy, then just bring it in a huge purse that zips at the top. It makes me feel like an accomplished drug smuggler after I sit down in my comfy seat.  I like that they have semi-reclining seats and that the theaters are all very clean. I havent once experience gum or debris on the seats here.  The staff is all very friendly, and i swear they are all 17-ish.  Check it out, not a bad choice for a movie theater.  I mean, its no iPic, but its decent.

Eghhhhhhhh. It's a Michael Mina restaurant that can be hit or miss on service but the food is fantastic if you're willing to pay a pretty penny.  Ambiance is on point and great for a nice fancy dinner. Very comfortable seating indoors and outdoors as well. My favorite thing to do is sit out by the fireplace in fall for happy hour drinks and some appetizers. It's somewhat "family seating" outside so sometimes you meet some chatty out-of-towners to take to, which is always a blast for me. Spreading my yelpiness to people new in the area looking for places to try or things to do.   Their happy hour is from 5-close if you sit fireside, and you can get a $5 dollar glass of wine or beer which I think is very reasonable. If you haven't been here for dinner yet and want to kind of check it out before committing to a fancy 175 dollar dinner, I would suggest coming at this time.   GREAT food on the menu: Lobster pot pie- it's rather large. So I would suggest splitting it. It's rich in flavor and amazing on a cold night. The tuna tartar is AHMAZING if you're a seafood fan and looking for a light and fresh appetizer. Duck fat fries are addicting, but very filling.  OBVIOUSLY if you haven't tried the butter poached steak you're missing out on life.   In regards to the bar-side: they barrel age their own fireball whiskey, which is quite good and definitely something I suggest indulging in if you're a whiskey drinker.  I'll keep this place on my birthday/anniversary/holiday dinner list.

This venue is so incredibly cute, especially at night! Its right next to the Grayhawk golf course and has quite the "upscale" feel to it, even though it is a smaller location and very affordable.  This is the perfect place for date night, yet, if youre coming in on the weekend, I would suggest making a reservation.   I like the menu style with the "farm to table" feel. The menu has a "healthier" look to it, but you dont sacrifice flavor thats forsure. When I went... I ordered the  Smoked Gouda Mac and cheese with garlic breadcrumbs...(NEED I SAY MORE!?) and Thai style ribs that just fell off the bone. These really were the best ribs I've ever had, with a different flavor which was refreshing. I've had good BBQ ribs before, but this was a whole different twist. I would definitely recommend it.   They have an outdoor patio and sometimes play live acoustic music... not quite sure when though, I forgot which weekdays.   I've only been here for the dinners, but I would love to come back for their breakfast... also heard they have an amazing brunch on sundays.

They have things that make them stand out as a coffee shop, but they strongly lack the things I need for it to be a return type place.  1. The only reason you will catch me in a coffee shop is because I need to use my laptop. So it needs free wifi and accessible wall outlets with comfortable seating. I'm not sure if they had the wifi, but it was definitely a no-go on the wall outlets and seating. There was one table and bar like seating, but that's about it. It's one of those very "hole in the wall" types, so make sure this would be your grab-and-go kind of stop.  2. I dont drink all that fancy coffee. I drink black coffee, thats it. No cream, no sugar... just, coffee. The coffee I got here was burnt and it was self serve, I dont know how fresh that is. Pretty disappointing.   3. I do like that they offer a vibe that reminds me of San Diego a bit, and that they support local art and bands which is pretty epic. Reminds me of the place that I used to live across the street from.   I do want to return just to try their food, their sandwiches seem reasonably priced, and I'll update my review if and when it happens. I was soooo looking forward to liking this place, it just didnt happen.

Shuffleboard, pool, golf arcade game, foosball and dartboards make for a fun time at this place. They also have a HUGE interior bar with plenty of space for seating. We typically go during the day so it's slow. We've gone a few times at night and there was live music playing, which is awesome. Wednesday nights they do live trivia at 7:30pm and Karaoke on Thursday and Saturday nights.   If you aren't interested in singing or competing in anything.... theres a bunch of TVs so it's cool to go to watch sports games. They have really affordable food and specials everyday.  Here's the breakdown: MONDAY: is a burger, turkey burger or pork sandwich for 3.50 (+1.00 for fries) TUESDAY: is prime rib with salad and fries for 10.75 WEDNESDAY: is ribs served with coleslaw, fries or potato salad for 9.75. Or their healthier option of one of their salads they offer for 8.50 THURSDAY: is the same rib offer from Wednesday. FRIDAY: is the shrimp platter with fries and coleslaw for 8.95 Or Baja fish tacos for 8.95 that come with fries. SATURDAY: Jack Daniels marinated steak! With salad and baked potatoes for 10.75  Another great thing about this place is how accommodating they are if you have a large party, you can bring 50+ people without having to pay reservation fees and all that nonsense like a lot of restaurants/bars will do you in the scottsdale.   Also, I've never had to use it... since I live 10 minutes away walking distance, but they do free "avoid a DUI" drives home from here...thats super legit.   I will forever love this place!

The salad bar..... Who needs the meat!! Unless it's the garlic beef. Or the cheesy bread knots. Now, I usually dont visit chain restaurants... especially after coming to this place from the San Diego location. I thought the food was just to DIE for, so I decided to take my friend who was visiting here (especially since I had a two people eat foooo FREE coupon). Now, I must say... I like this restaurant over the San Diego location. The tables are spaced out, and are definitely more accessible, you arent side-stepping between customers/servers trying to venture to the salad  bar or to your own table.  They have a drink service constantly going around? Something I'm definitely not used to. That was so incredibly convenient. The service was superb and the servers very friendly.  I would come here just for the garlic knots.  I seriously want to sneak in with ziplocs next time just to load up before I leave.... totally kidding. kinda. (IM FROM THE BAY AREA, we get ratchet).  Anyways A++++++.

Great for a quick hike, the views are amazing.  You can continuously climb up over the rocks, and the higher you go, the better the view. I see a lot of families taking this hike together with their kids.  Even though part of this climb feels like its a direct incline, my 4.5 pound puppy was able to do it.  I'm definitely coming back to this one, especially since its so close to my house!  The parking can be difficult, but other reviewers are right, its not as difficult as camelback parking.  I also like that is less crowded than camelback.

After hiking camelback, I was hoping that this trail would be more challenging then it was. We did the loop trail, which was 4.6 miles. You don't have as much of a panoramic view as you do when you're hiking camelback, but the trail is very peaceful for a Sunday afternoon. This is more of a relaxing hike than a exercise hike. It's a good running hike, since you don't have much of an incline, but be careful of all the rocks and unsteady gravel. There are a lot of cacti here, I bet it would be amazing to come here when they bloom. Anyway, I became bored halfway in with nothing much to look at, but the start of the trail is really cool.  You have a map of the mountains and the types of routes you can take. Also have a lot of information on the preserve.  I would return to do a run, but not to hike. It's a good hike for a newbie though!

My firs time at a savers! They have a ton of variety for seasonal items (Halloween costumes) and a lot of clothes. Their housewares items are WAY overpriced and the quality is less than impressive. Also, it was the last week of September... Everyone was dressed in costumes, playing Halloween music. I'm all for celebration, but a little early.  This place is still better than good will, but i would only shop here for clothes.

The prettiest store in the region without-a-doubt. Has a very open feel to it when you walk in. It's frequently very busy on weekends, so weekday visits are always a priority in my book. The Genius Bar is legit. They have a new texting option for your appointments so you don't have to sit around waiting, you can do other things in Scottsdale Quarter while you wait. I always make an appointment, since sometimes walk-ins can have a long wait. Best way to make appointments is through the Apple Store app or online.  You can even use the Apple Store app to make purchases directly through your phone, without even having to make contact with someone if you don't see someone available.  The only thing that can require some patience is the parking, other than that...it's awesome

I've been living here for a few weeks and was really freaked out by all these reviews I was reading on apartments.com about how terrible this place is. But... I love it! I have a roomy one bedroom apartment for 600 dollars and my apartment has great heating and air conditioning. I have access to two pools and the community lounge has free coffee (free donut Fridays!) and they do cool events on the weekends for their tenants. Rent can be paid online and the maintenance can be requested online too. The front office is insanely helpful and quick to help you out with all needs you have.  I would highly check this place out as an apartment consideration. Located right off of 7th and bell you are walking distance to EVERYTHING.  I'll definitely update this review if anything changes lol

BEST MASSAGE STUDIO IN THE VALLEY, BY FAR!  A very clean and relaxing studio, the massage therapists will customize any massage to your liking and are trained in many different techniques so it's not just some generic massage you receive.  It's also cool that they give you a recommendation sheet at the end of your massage and even some stretching cards that can help for you to improve some of your problem areas before you even come back in!  The membership is the way to go, saves you a ton of money and you're not obligated to get a massage each month, since they roll over if you don't use them. Plus you can add someone to your account so they can either use your credits or give them to someone else.  And it's really easy to book an appointment, the receptionists are phenomenal!

I would of given this place 5 stars if the chick at the front wasnt so rude, the older blonde lady can suck it. Don't tell me I can't get an ID without an older ID. You have my picture on file and I know my drivers license number. THEN don't roll your eyes when I request a number anyways because I want to verify with a DMV employee. When I got my ID I wanted to get her name for being so rude, she refused to give it to me. That chick needs to be fired. No wonder people have a complex about dealing with people at the DMV. Die in a fire. Never coming back to this place.

This is my number one stop to get a quick shopping fix, especially when I don't want to explore fashion square mall for my entire day. I feel like I get more stressed out trying to figure out my GPS location at fashion square than I do actually enjoy the shopping.  Now, Scottsdale quarter is fully outdoors, so if it's BLISTERING heat outside, it might not be your favorite place to be. Although on fall nights it's my favorite place to get a bite to eat and spend some of the money that I definitely don't have. Also I believe during some seasons they do concerts in the park, plus H&M and Apple are right next to each other so I don't have to walk much when I am here. And want a cup of coffee to keep you going? Pressed coffee is a straight gift from god. Everytime!

Always have had a great experience here, no complaints. At this location I've only had my eyebrows done, but with horrific stories of going to cheaper places I'll spend the extra 8 dollars to ensure that the half side of my right eyebrow doesn't get removed again. Hahahaha  The ability to book is really easy (I do so online) and the receptionists are always very friendly and welcoming when you walk in the door. The only thing I hate that they do is try and up-sell you at the end. I don't want to spend an arm and a leg up front for future appointments, I just want to pay for my one-time fee. They do make an effort to show the value of it, but I'm just not about it.   They did offer to fill in my brows with pencil after waxing them....but I saw Chelsea C.'s brows in her review below and I decided to pass. Haha

To be honest, I love this place. There's two different types of environments I've encountered here: Sunday morning and every other day/night.   SUNDAYS: Now let me tell you, if you like to people watch, Sunday Brunch is the place you need to be. They do bottomless mimosas (or bloody Mary's), which is either 25 dollars without food or (I believe) 15 dollars with the purchase of an entry...which is usually 10-15 dollars. You might as well get the food! Also, they serve mimosas till 2. Be aware if they are having large groups come in, because when we got there right when it started, it was a 2 hour wait....but you can always walk in a sneak a place at the bar! No reservations there. Plus, I like the bar better. You don't have to worry about an extra wait time on your drinks because the bartender stands right in front of you, the second your drink is empty, you blink and BAM! Drinks are ready. They also have a DJ playing, loudly, so if you plan on sitting and having a nice discussion, go somewhere else. Everyone that attends Sunday brunch is very composed...until about noon. Then you have drunk ASU kid + every other type of person in their 20's dancing, then ordering shots and this is where the real drama unfolds. I urge you to check this out, because it is hilarious. The things I witnessed on my trip to the bathroom (which took 20 minutes trying to wiggle my way through the crowd) are permanently burned in my memory. Awesome way to spend the early portion of your Sunday. You know, if you aren't going to church.   MON-FRIDAY: They have great drink and food specials. And their food is amazing. 3-7pm they do half of select drinks (with a great beer menu) and 6 dollar select plates... Dirty chips for the win! They also do somewhat of a reverse happy hour from 10-midnight it's half off ALL food and 1/2 off select drinks. If you want to come in and try their food without spending too much money, this is the way to go.  And if you didn't get the memo above, their service is great. I always find myself talking to our servers at our table instead of just ordering. I think we've even invited them to sit down with us a couple of times. One time they did! Haha very down to earth staff, very approachable.  There was one occurrence when we had ordered food and a pitcher.... After eating and finishing our beer, we didn't see our server for 15-20 minutes, we asked another server to bring us our bill if he got a chance, when he brought it buy us.. Our total was 0.00!! They said "sorry for you wait"... Now that is service!!! I think we tipped him the entire bill cost, but how awesome is that!   FOOD SUGGESTIONS: Dirty Chips: (as an appetizer) it's bacon, ranch, bleu cheese, buffalo sauce and their house chips. It's Amazing.  Taco Plate: (at brunch) you get 3 tacos: chorizo and egg (the best) potato and egg (tied for first) and bacon and egg. I want to say they all come with cheese too. Plus you get a side of potatoes. Chicken sandwich: now this isn't some plain chicken sandwich it comes with BRIE on focaccia bread with some type of aioli sauce and sundried tomatoes. Is is a heavenly sandwich for lunch or for dinner.   Sorry this review is so long. I just love this place. Haha I hope you try it!

IF ASHTON, TROY or DANIEL are working... You will love everything about your visit! YOU THE REAL MVP! When people are passionate about communicating with others, you know you've hit a gold mine.The beer menu is great, the food is amazing and I really cant think of anything negative to say about this place. My go-to spot in Scottsdale. Especially on weekdays, cause weekends can get a little too crazy for me. Haha

Open 24 hours a day, how convenient is that!  I absolutely love their apple fritters, I'm addicted to them. Heated up they are amaaaaaazing! They're even more addicting because I get a free donut out of every New Times that comes out on Tuesdays.  I wouldn't necessarily look at this place as a comfortable coffee shop vibe, it's more of a grab and go kind of place. Honestly I don't think I've ever seen other people there, but their donuts are cheap and delicious.

Being that I work across the street I felt like I had to come check it out, even though I've had bad experiences at other 5 guy locations. I actually was entertained by the energy the people working had. They were all dancing around to music while making food and looked like they we're having a good time. I decided to order the veggie sandwich , since I broke and that's the cheapest/healthier choice on the menu. It was really good!!!! Like a boss cheese sandwich it came with sautéed onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, lettuce and American cheese.  The only reason I give this place 4/5 was because their tomatoes weren't ripe.  Definitely coming back for that sandwich though, even with a jimmy johns next door. Lol

I great place to go to watch sports games. It was packed, so my friend and I decided (instead of waiting for a table) to go to the bar. We Were instantly seated right in front of the flat screens and had a perfect view of the game!  The only complaint I have, was that the server messed up our order and what sauces we wanted on our wings. We decided not to say anything cause we were starving and it took long enough to get our wings the first time.  The thai style and original sauces are my favorite! Must try.  And as always, boneless or it isnt happening.

I love this place. My fellow yelp elite introduced me to the WONDERFUL mac and cheese the first time I ever came her, instantly I was in love. The bacon and chicken mac and cheese with siracha is my favorite. Its outstanding. Large chunks of chicken and bacon with Parmesan cheese on top. They're brunch menu is also great (I love their breakfast nachos!) and brunch runs till 3pm. A perfect stop after a heavy night of drinking.  I would suggest sitting outside!  Also, the outdoor bar that's wrapped around a tree .... very good place to sit and get a drink.  Cant wait to come back!

OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH This place.  If you want to people watch, this is the place to go.  This seems like the stripper hangout late night Sunday/Monday mornings?  I'M NOT ONE TO JUDGE,  but if you're breaking down into the splits and popping your ass I know you had to practice to do all that, that is not a natural talent.  I''ve seen more lap dances happen here than I have seen happen at a strip club.  There is a younger crowd on the weekends, yet it seems like relationship city, maybe I was just there on an off night? But it seemed like that ditsy Scottsdale girl, her clueless boyfriend and awkward 3rd wheel friend standing in the center of the dance floor doing their best imitation of the miley cyrus twerk.  God, this sounds so harsh, but it really is just an accurate depiction of whats going on here.  The bouncers are all great and the servers are SUPER sweet and down to earth.  I guess I like the staff more than the clientele.  They are open late night! So if youre done drinking at 2 and arent quite ready for your Jack in the Box run... you can come dance here till 4!

I like how they send their delivery driver out without any cash, so he ends up getting a 7 dollar tip on a 7 dollar sandwich. Never ordering food from this place again.

First of all, I love that they do free refills on their coffee, especially since I work across the street. It's a small location, but it's packed all the time! They have great iced coffee, but even better hot coffee. It's jam packed with caffeine which makes a huge difference when you're falling asleep while walking into work.   The staff is really sweet and very talkative so it's a nice place to interact with others.   I guess the location can be inconvenient for people who are just trying to pick up something quick and jump in the car and go... Since street parking is extremely limited and parking garage experiences can be a pain, so just keep that in mind.  Food wise, you HAVE to try one of their breakfast burritos, the ingredients are incredibly fresh and well priced for being in Scottsdale Quarter.

When the weather is perfect this is the easiest place to rent from and it seems as though they never run out of boards/boats. I've only rented the paddleboards which were 20 dollars an hour, a little steep, but you pay for the convenience of not having to travel with your board to get down to the lake (either by car or by walking) and just getting on one straight off the dock.  The boards were in good condition, but I couldn't say the same for the creatures living in the lake, we were consistently seeing fish belly-up and dead birds floating by us.... good ole AZ lakes, such a beautiful thing to see! Haha.  You get some pretty great shots of the bridges along the waterfront and i'd say an hour is enough time if you're inexperienced. The amount of muscle it took for me to balance (my thighs, calves, back and abs) made me feel like I was hit by a truck the next morning.  So its safe to say this is a great workout for someone who still wants something fairly relaxing to do. We went right at the end of March so the weather was perfect.   I would suggest leaving your things in your car or bringing a ziplock bag to put them in. You will get wet from either sitting on the board or splashes from when the wind picks up in the afternoon. I trusted myself enough to bring my phone with me, but some may not be as brave.   Trying to knock your significant other off their board with your paddle can definitely lead to some hysterical laughter. I suggest trying this is you get the opportunity to.

Came here to check out the dog friendly patio and the homemade dog treats. It's a really chill environment to get some beers, we decided to try out the pepper salad which was on the happy hour menu, it was extremely small portions for the cost of the dish.  Yet, they have an awesome rotating beer list and great deals on pitchers. The fact that they have an assisting brewer course that you can sign up for is pretty cool, and the service there is great. I would love to come back and get some entree to test out more of the food.  Also riding our bikes down there since it's near the canal route and they supply you with bike locks too!

Awesome place to play Disk golf in the spring/fall, I love it! It's a pretty place to walk around. You typically see a lot of joggers on the path throughout the day.  I love to take the pups here, even when it's hot we bring snacks and have a picnic beneath the trees lol  And if it's hot there's a really cook splash park for the kids, you press the activate button and it usually runs 5-10 minutes before you have to click it again. There's a ton of fish in the pond, which surprises me cause it just seems like they grow up in 2-feet-deep toxic waste. Be careful of the duck! I've seen them trying to attack dogs and they'll rip food right out of your hand!  If you've never played disk golf before and you want to check it out, there's a disk golf shop walking distance where you can rent equipment too.

Had the luxury of attending a NCA event in the private dining area of SOL. It was on a Tuesday night, I arrived a little early, so I was able to sit at the bar and check out their Taco Tuesday menu + order a drink. They have an extensive list of imported beers, more than I am typically used to.   Location: Its right in the Scottsdale Quarter and located right next door to the parking garage, so its a short walk from the car to the restaurant entrance, extremely convenient.   Ambiance: I like the low lighting and the openness of this place. They have an indoor/outdoor bar and a great private dining area for corporate events, private dinners, etc. Also, the high top tables are great, and the lounge area outside with the heaters! Superb.   Employees: All very friendly, especially the bartenders, who made sure my drink was always full and made sure I was taken care of. Extra plus, theyre all attractive. eye candy for the win.   Food: The TACOS! So delicious. I had the steak and chicken tacos, with their extra spicy sauce. So delicious. I love that they make your guac from scratch, so everything is extremely fresh tasting. Plus, how do you go wrong on a taco tuesday? 2 street tacos for 2.50! You're full after 5 dollars.   Make sure you use the check-in offer, its 5 dollars off any margarita, wonderful.  Did I mention the live music on Tuesdays? Super legit. Its acoustic and not like a mariatchi band. I appreciate that.

First of all, I love places that have fun thing to do while you're there. I guess I've just never grown out of my child phase.  Anyways, my boyfriend and I stopped in after a day drinking excursion in Old town and thought this place looked cool, so we decided to order a beer and check it out.  So much room for so many activities!!!!  When we stepped outside, there's a couple of games for giant Jenga, corn hole, ping pong and tether ball?! I'm reliving my first year of college with drinking games!  I loved the craft beer selection and the service was great. Everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable. We showed up just a few hours after Germany won and played in the World Cup so we heard it was insane. Wish I would of been there for that!  Unfortunately I haven't tried any of the food, but I'm coming back because 1. I love pretzels 2. I love Nutella AND ITS A FREE CHECK IN DEAL?!?! Why didn't I redeem this while I was there?!?!  Kicking myself.

How could you write a 5 star review on an .....olive oil place? Well after visiting, it's pretty easy. I thought I would just cruise in to check it out and actually got a free bottle of crushed basil olive oil! It is by far the best tasting basil olive oil I've ever had and I've recently been putting it on anything. But I digress. The employees here are really helpful and let you taste test a lot!  I would suggest checking this place out when they do free events. I want to say they used to be on Wednesday evenings? You get to try different products paired with foods and wine. All sample size obviously, but still a great opportunity.  They don't have just cooking products either, their lavender body line is freaking amazing. I feel more relaxed just thinking about it.

if you want quality craft beer and a huge selection.... this is the place to be. I always ask for tasters before ording a pint and the bartenders are always friendly enough to let me try what I want. Also, its a rotating beer menu, so there is something new to try every time I go!  I would also recommend trying their beer flights, so you can get a little taste of everything.  I like to sit outside on the patio and silently judge the drunken ASU kids that walk down Mill Ave, embarassing themselves in so many ways. Its just my form of entertainment.  They also do Trivia night which is free!  I will avoid this place like the plague during the weekends though, its small and gets crowded quite quicky, but the weekday its just perfect.

This place is so cute! We were able to stop in while making a trip to CVS to have a couple of beers, they definitely have an interesting collection of rotating ones.  I liked the sour beer and the IPA the most, the only one I thought was questionable was the beets flavored beer.  Then again, I'm not a fan of beets and I was not the one to order it, so I can't really say much, other than how popular it was shocked me a bit.   I really want to try the Jess pizza, which sounds amazing and com back for a few more beers. The pricing was a little high for my taste, but then again I would go to local breweries and spend 4-5 dollars on a pint.   It's not going to keep me from coming back though. Just maybe more-so after a payday. Lol

Is it just me, or is this place always spotless?  I've been to many different Sprout stores and this one takes the cake.  Now, I love sprouts, but I'll only go here for the produce and their pre-made meals.  My favorite thing there to pick up? The pork carnitas ... its under 3 dollars and you just pop them in the oven for 30 seconds.... best tasting carnitas ever. The TAMALES ARE GREAT TOOOO! So addicting.  Anyways, the produce is always reasonably priced and sometimes they have amazing sales that shock you.  If you're into making smoothies... their frozen fruit is also reasonably priced...  ON THE OTHER HAND... I refuse to buy anything pre-packaged here. Or any type of dairy product. I feel like its 2x more expensive here then it is at Fry's or even Safeway.  The only thing I would suggest you buy here thats pre-packaged is the AAAAAMAZING chocolate chip cookies that have a full serving of fruit and  full serving of vegetables per 3 cookies. They taste better than chips ahoy and I how do you go wrong with something that has minimal preservatives and some type of health benefit? I feel 10000 times less guilty about binge eating cookies now.  Thanks Sprouts!  In regards to the service,  the cashiers are great! I've gone here multiple times and I'm constantly getting tips on what to add to my smoothie creations. They know just what to suggest to suggest nutrients without sacrificing flavor.   BTW HAVE YOU HAD KALE CHIPS?!!?!  You will thank me.

10 dollar donation for up to 60 pounds of fruits and veggies!!! I couldn't believe it when I stumble upon the yelp reviews, so I had to check it out for myself. They apparently have a different variety every Saturday so if you want to make this a routine, I would stop by and check the board before waiting in the line.  Usually a lot of them are as much as you can grab, some fruits/veggies are limited.  I was able to get a max of 2 seedless watermelons, 2 honeydew melons, and 6 bell peppers. We grabbed SOOO many other peppers, zucchini, tomatoes and a variety of squash.  I would suggest getting there early, I got there at about 7:30am and there was about a 20 minute wait. I saw a lot of people bring their own boxes, but I just grabbed one while I was there.  I'm going to have soooooo many recipes to look up! Also, the people working the vegetable checks and everything are wry sweet, if you aren't sure what something is or what to cook with it... Just ask! They give great advice.

I absolutely love this place, it's incredibly large and I could get lost in here for hours. I even think that it's more affordable here then it is at Michael's, you just have to make sure you use the coupons offered online and in store, and the selection is greater. Being that I'm a cocktail waitress who has to get creative with outfits during certain holidays, I've found myself here buying party supplies, tulle for homemade tutus and hair accessories. Everyone that works here is really friendly and willing to help you find what you need and get creative in the process.  Definitely going here over any fabric store or hobby shop again.

So we came here for my friends daughters birthday... We originally tried to go to hooters, the servers were rude and gave a time limit on eating food so we said f that and came here. Jordan... best server EVER!!!! He checked in on our table consistently, he brought our food out in a timely manner and he even announced it was angel's birthday to the entire staff and brought her ice cream to go because we were running on a time crunch.. He also gave her a to-go cup for her Shirley temple. SOMEONE GET THIS GUY A RAISE!  Very approachable, was cracking jokes with us, and i really enjoyed our food!  Will be coming back and requesting to sit in his section.

Loved this place!!!!!!!! Saw that their was a brewery not to far from my house so I had to go check it out. It's a small location, but a great find. They have beers that they are constantly brewing on site and switching out the menu constantly. I ended up talking to the bartender or a good amount of time and he invited us to the back where one of the brewers gave us a private tour and breakdown on how the beers are brewed, step by step.  If you're a beer enthusiast, like myself, I would suggest checking out the beer flights to get a little taste of everything. One of my personal favorite was the James Brown Ale?i think that was the name.  I really want to come back when they have live music. It was a great experience and I can't wait to go back!

Dislocated a joint in my shoulder and I have never been to a chiropractor before but I was in SOO much pain one of the massage therapists i work with recommended I check this place out. I walked in to this location to see if the wait was long and it was all of 5 minutes. Sweet! I filled out all the paperwork and upon finishing was instantly called back. The amount of inflammation was insane, Dr. Palazzo (?) Was amazing!!!!!! He was very gentle but adjusted my back in the way it needed to be. Less then 6 hours later my pain level went from a 10 to a 4 and that's after 6 days of a pain level of 10! I signed up for their monthly membership, which is awesome. It's 59 dollars to get 4 adjustments a month. Also, if you sign up they give you this cute little ice/hot pack as a welcome gift. I love that you don't even have to check in with the front desk when you get there... You just have to scan your membership card! So quick, easy and efficient. From start to finish the longest I've been there is 30 minutes. I recommend EVERYONE comes here! Chiropractors are saints for people with back/neck/hip pain.

This is the Vegas of Scottsdale, but it's still not Vegas. If you want a club experience with good music, this is a decent place. But you'll pay for it. I ordered a well vodka drink and a well vodka shot... 32 dollars? Kill yourself. Plus I had to pay a 10 dollar cover? Seriously? Egh. It always seems busy on the weekends, I'll definitely be coming back in the summer for the day club.

Okay.  So, maybe this review has to do with how I'm not typicaly into country. Dont get me wrong, I'll listen to it, I'll sing along to it, and I'll drink whiskey from the bottle like a country girl......... but the crowd at this place. omg.  I wanted to murder whoever invented plaid. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?! If it wasnt some white boy wearing plaid and boots (some of them attractive, yes) It was some strange girl in a mini skirt, and a sparkle tube top... what? Also, I had never seen a rhinestone belt, before this outing. I am thoroughly confused. Its got a very hick-LA feel if you ask me. lol  Anyways, this place was PACKED on a friday, and I loved the live band. I didnt love the drunk girls trying to two-step ontop of my feet, but was so entertained by the chaos that is WR I didnt complain too much. The service here can be a little slow, because it is so busy, but I guess you cant fault the bar for that.  I wouldnt come here for a mellow drink with a friend, but if you want to get blacked out drunk and wake up in a strangers bed the next morning... I think that this is the place for you.

I've lived here for 7 months, and I really wish I never moved in. Like, at all.  Be aware of the "contests" they have held in the past for Yelp reviews. If you wrote a positive/5 star review, you could potentially earn money off your rent. Which, is COMPLETELY against Yelps policy, btw. So half (or more) of these 5 star reviews are written by frauds who just want to knock down their severely overpriced rent. And when I say severely overpriced, I'm not exaggerating.  First of all, my roommate and I were the first ones to move into our apartment. It looked pretty cool, even though they gave us  1. The flooring and cabinets we said we didn't want. I hate light wood, but whatever too late to change it once you've been given your keys. 2. The second bedroom didn't have a ceiling fan, and it's the smallest bedroom. Who the &($@ doesn't install ceiling fans when we live in ARIZONA and live on the 4TH floor!!! They said "oh yeah, we can do that, for a $50 dollar fee." 3. The pet fee is ridiculous and a 500 deposit is dumb for a place that has zero enclosed places for dogs. You're paying extra a month for them to have installed dog waste bags in three areas around the complex. My old apartment, where I was paying a quarter of what I am paying here had a full on dog park, gym, pool house. I wish I would of just stayed there.   In regards to how cheap this place was built: The "hardwood floor" is constantly coming up in places that you stub your toe on, the doors don't even line up with the frame so you have to struggle to get it to actually close and lock. When we moved in, I had a massive hole underneath my bathroom sink from how they installed it and decided it didn't need to be covered. They left plywood and parts they used to build the unit on top of our kitchen cabinets (because who needs to actually TAKE the things you used to build the unit?) Also, the light bulbs burn out faster than someone can smoke a cigarette. So annoying.   Even more cons: 1. The people here are LOUD, just last night I'm hearing girls screaming about Mill Ave. except I can say this can be entertaining. Like the time my boyfriend and I sat on the patio and listened to two other neighbors argue at 11pm because one has a dog that barks during the day and the other works nights. There was crying and screaming and it was better than watching Bad Girls Club. I digress.  2. If you're getting something mailed and it gets left at your doorstep, fingers crossed it's there when you get home! All these shady people in here.  3. The dorm style set up here is really gross and it's only been a year old. The carpets are outside and completely stained and half of it is dirty concrete 4. They charge you additional a month for "valet trash" which is dumb AF for me because my apartment is the closest apartment to the trash can. But most people leave their stuff out all day cause they won't be home by the time they pick it up, which to me means... YOU TAKE IT OUT WHEN YOU GET HOME.  5. The parking garage blows. Just read any of the reviews below me, I'm sure they touch base on that disaster.  6. When I first moved in they said it was a 21 and up facility, when clearly that is BS. They've got 19 year old kids running around being reckless while daddy pays the rent from out of state. That or you have the 6 year olds cannon balling into the pool while you try to lay out. False advertising. 7. The kids here are always throwing up in the elevator, I mean every 2/4 weekends you open the door to vomit. Then the elevators are closed for a week and even when it's "clean" it still smells of stomach acid. So you're forced to take the stairs, hope you don't have a sprained ankle or a bad knee!  The very limited-pros: 1. They used to do cool events for residents to get to know each other. They would do beer/wine tasting, host free food/appetizers, have a DJ out by the pool with free margaritas......now they do Yoga on Tuesdays. I'm assuming the events got too expensive for them to continue, so now it's .....yoga. I don't want Yoga. I want food and drinks.  2. They have free Starbucks and tea, (the teas are usually empty anyways) but id rather save 600 dollars and just go to a Starbucks myself.  3. They have a 24 hour pool, I don't know if I'd take advantage of it at night though cause if people are constantly throwing up in an elevator I don't want to know what they're doing in that pool. 4. They have dog treats. My dogs like that. 5. Their community room has 3 flat screen Tvs, since I'm spending an arm and a leg on rent I'm too broke for cable, so thanks Skysong for providing that!  6. Free wifi downstairs, everyone offers free wifi now. 7. I guess they have a nice gym, but there's too many bros there grunting around carrying their gallon jugs of water for me to be interested in going.    The coolest employee they had here was Tiffany, and she even left this place.  Don't move here. You will regret it. ....I only gave them two stars for the dog treats.

They dong have dog treats anymore. And I said before that was the only reason they got 2 stars. So, I'm updating this review.

I don't understand why it's necessary to have 2 Starbucks coffees directly across the street from each other. UNTIL I went to the drive thru on 7th right next to my apartment and they had RUN OUT OF COFFEE. How is this possible? It's an effing coffee shop.  Anyways, I came to this place and they saved the day!  It's not as clean as the other place on 7th, but they are a bit faster at making drinks.

I'm not a big fan of charbroiled burgers, but this place is bomb!  The service is always fast, the environment is always clean and the staff is always friendly. My 2 favorite things (which I never order at any other restaurant) are the char chicken club with avocado and bacon on grilled sourdough and the tempura battered green beans! YUM! Their fries are pretty good, but honestly I prefer the green beans and I don't even like green beans!  The food here is really cheap and I like that they give you one of those buzzers when you order so you can do your own thing and not have to listen much to them calling our orders. The only reason I give this place 4/5 stars is because they've messed up my order 2 and gave me the wrong amount of change a few times. Little mistakes, but they were also on little orders. So review your receipts and the money you spent!  Also I think it's funny when you walk in the door the "manager" says "HI! How are you?" Without ever looking up, I find that strange. Lol

I love Ironwood, except I've only had the chance to eat here with their lunch/dinner menu. Its the restaurant located on the first floor near the pool at the Fairmont, and its  a beautiful place to get food when its nice out. Very open floor plan with a LOT of windows.  The service is great, I've never had my water glass go less than 3/4ths of the way down. There are a couple of great dishes (in my opinion). My favorite is the Spanish Ham flatbread with fig and herb/parmesan cheese.. delicious. Everything is made fresh to order, including their juices.(get an iced tea to go as well!)  My second favorite dish is the pan salmon, its straight oven to table, so its extremely hot when you get it, still in its original baking dish. Its in this yellow pepper sauce which is delightfully paired with asparagus and mushrooms. They have childrens menus and even little leap pads for the kids to play with while the adults enjoy their meal. I've even seen them give kids little sunglasses on their way out/in.  The menu for lunch and dinner is the same, and lunch is served typically starting at 11:30am.  Everyone RAVES about their breakfast, but I havent been able to try it yet.  If you're in the fairmont area and want a casual atmosphere with great service and phenomenally fresh food, this is your place.  But, if you want mexican food... you HAVE to go to la hacienda on the same property.

Definitely liked this place after trying it for the first time the other day, I would definitely suggest going during their happy hour because their rolls are much cheaper, also their happy hour menu changes each month, so it's always something new! I made sure I checked in to get the free miso soup...score!  This place is surprisingly much bigger on the inside than I was expecting. They have somewhat of a segregated bar area, booths, and sushi bar seating.   We ordered the Alaskan roll, the Nebraska roll, Philadelphia roll and spicy salmon roll. The only one I wasn't really pleased with was the Nebraska roll because I felt it was somewhat over seasoned and soggy.  I really liked the fresh rolls though! The Philadelphia had big chunks of meat in each piece (unlike some restaurants I've experienced out in AZ). The salmon was very fresh and we got a lot of it.  I read about some of the 12-15 dollar rolls, they sound delicious! But I just can't bring myself to pay that. I am cheap. Hahahaa   We did get to watch some drama unfold between a server and one of the new sushi chefs. So free entertainment while we ate.   I'm definitely coming back though!

If I want to go dancing, this is where I am going.  They have awesome light-up walls and little dance platforms... also, 2 dollar Smirnoff drinks on Sundays!?! DOWN.  We came in pretty early, so there werent many people, but still a good place to sit, chat and even play some cornhole if youre feeling competitive.  The bartenders are very nice, service is fast and the drinks are strong.  They have a great musical selection and music playing on outdoor patio as well. They have little booths and smoking sections... bomb!  I only stopped here for a drink, but will definitely be coming back.

My first stop ever in downtown Scottsdale, not quite sure why. I had a friend visiting and we started to roam the entertainment district.  The layout of this place is cool though, a mix of booths, tables, barstools. Lots of T.V.'s so I would suggest coming here if you wanted to watch a sports game downtown.  The girls here have the absolute CUTTTTTTEST uniform, I wish I worked there. Just for the outfit. haha  The drinks were a little pricey from what I was used to (then again, im Downtown.. what do I expect) and the service seemed slow.  I thought it was interesting that they had games backed up against the wall ...including ski ball. Now, Im not usually a fan of games, but I'm down to bet I will kick your butt at ski ball over a beer. I could see me getting competitive and equally as wasted at one of those machines. The food menu seemed a little pricey as well... and I wasnt necessarily dying to try anything I read on the menu.  I'm sure I'll stop back in here eventually if I'm in the area... but I wont drive from North Phoenix to come back.

Perfect for date night, I had a 50 dollar gift card so I brought my boyfriend here at about dinner time and I'm so glad I did!  The ambience is beautiul, I love high street and it's definitely becoming more upscale. The parking wasn't difficult for us and it was free! (definitely an upside to this location over the mill ave one).  We chose to sit outside since it was so nice out... Our server greeted us promptly and gave us the wine list which is actually HUGE. (Definitely IS a wine bar).  Based on how upscale this place FEELS, I was surprised by how good the prices were. I would definitely check this place out for happy hour if you get a chance.  My boyfriend and decided we were going to split all of our dishes and the servers didn't make a fuss about it. Everything was presented beautifully (see pictures) and tasted great! I would HIGHLY recommend the bruschetta flights! Such great flavor combinations.  Out of all the pizzas, my favorite was the garlic pizza with green tomatoes.....I DIE. I could eat it for the rest of my life. Can't wait to come back here!

MADE TO ORDER SUSHI? AND ALL YOU CAN EAT?  This can't be right. But it's true!! and I can't wait to go back.  Its $11.99 for all you can eat lunch and $20 dollars for the dinner.  The website was a little confusing because it doesn't say anything about it being an all you can eat place, more so it shows things you can order for takeout, which are much more expensive then dining in.  When we got there i instantly ordered as much nigiri and I thought I could stomach (its one piece per order), They had really high quality salmon and tuna, to my surprise.  We then moved on to rolls, then more nigiri and I instantly regretted it since I was getting so full I thought i was going to burst. (why you were leggings or a dress to all you can eat places!) hahaha. Yet, we fought our way through 6 more pieces of nigiri. While we were looking at the menu for dessert, we read some small print stating that whatever you don't eat you have to pay for.  So i start panicking... is that extra $_ per roll?, per piece? per part of nigiri?! I have to admit I started just to eat the salmon off the tops of the rice balls so I could end up eating more fish and not being tricked by the rice.  After reading this, my fiancé and I had a hilarious time trying to hide left-over balls of rice into our napkins while the servers weren't looking.  I'm sure this was dramatic on our part because we ate everything else, but you can never be too careful!  This place does say that its a rotating sushi restaurant, but none were running when we were there, it was just made to order. So, just be mindful of how hungry you are, and hope that your brain isn't bigger than your stomach.   After reading all these amazing reviews I really wish I would of tried the dessert, but I guess there is always next time.   For ambiance and service, it was quite dark in there, but like I care to see other people, I just want to see enough to evaluate the food in front of my face.  The service was fabulous. Super attentive and always clearing off our plates and filling our water glasses.   I must admit, the dessert does have some excellent sushi. Shocking as that is.

I can't even explain to you how much I love coming to this place on my lunch break. Fired pie is located near chipotle across the street from Scottsdale quarter. And is a super convenient stop if you are shopping in the area. You can order an 11"inch pie and customize it and add whatever you want for one price only. They have a few pizzas on the menu that you can order in case you don't want to have to build your own. My favorite one is the steak and bleu cheese pizza with the garlic sauce. It's freakin' delightful.  The customer service here is amazing, always greeted with a smile and takes practically no time to get your food. You get to see everything from what they add to your pizza and when they add it to the oven (similar to a subway type ordering method) which leaves you knowing they didn't miss a thing during your order process.  they also have a pretty decent selection of teas to go with your meal if you'd like while also serving beer and wine.  They also have red peppers and ranch upon request at no additional charge. I haven't tried the salads here cause the pizza is too good to try something else.

First of all, who trains the wait staff here?!? I've come a few times and the service is disastrous! Going 20 minutes without water is atrocious when there's only 4 other tables. Also, leaving the check on the table is fine when we aren't even halfway done eating, but to then interrupt our conversation 10 minutes later and ask that we pay the bill now, is rude. And whoever their male server is...is the worst! He brings you the check, takes your card and then hovers over your shoulder when you're filling out the receipt. What is wrong with you?! Like I said, who allows to let these people serve!  Xnejfieokefnfilwnrr Anyways, the buffet food is actually pretty okay,especially for 8.00 a lunch. They have fresh shrimp, a sushi bar (basic rolls) and then everything they have a typical Chinese lunch buffet, they also have a chocolate fountain which I haven't tried, I don't know how sanitary that is when I've seen little kids sticking their fingers in it. No thank you. They have a habachi grill as well, where you get to choose your ingredients and they cook it for you, but both times I've eaten from it my food was extremely overcooked and inedible. I may come back to get a to-go box, 1lb is 4.75, much cheaper to get a pound of fresh shrimp here than it is at the grocery store. Just saying.  But the service here....yuck.

Best haircut experience I've had since I moved to Arizona. Not only was Ashleigh the easiest person to talk to, but she understood exactly what I wanted to do with my hair. I have received nothing but compliments since she cut and colored it. She has an adorable spot, which I had a bit of a hard time finding because it's a part of a bigger building with leased salon spaces. But that's because I'm navigationally challenged.  We had some girl talks and she offered me a beer?! It was after noon..... So down!  You MUST come see her for awesome color and cuts!

I can't speak for this place on the weekends because I avoid Tempe like the plague, but I do say that I love this place on the weekdays. The people: the bartenders are super cool and very knowledgeable on the beers they offer. Service is always super fast, even if it's busy. They have an amazing selection of beers, too. So craft beer lovers, come play!! Happy hour pricing is on point too, especially if you want to eat some wings. Also, plenty of things to do here, since I hate just sitting at the bar and having a drink. There's bucket pong, beer pong (cup challenge game), ski-ball, and rockem sockem robots...which are dangerous for competitive people like me.  For atmosphere...they have a huge outdoor area with high quality patio furniture and nice lighting. Also, keep an eye out for their Trivia nights, the people running it are really friendly and ask some great questions.  Going back every week!

Really excellent breakfast place!  We ended up coming here for breakfast while my family was in town from California... we didnt want to go to some corporate owned chain or some place in Scottsdale with a 1 hour wait because of all the Spring Training nonsense.  I love the idea that its a locally owned, so I was sold.  There are a few things I really enjoy from here...  1. The service. We have AMAZING service everytime we come here, whether it be busy or slow, we are never waiting long... the servers are friendly, they refill drinks and dont judge you when you want to have a whiskey shot at 9am (hey it was our day off!).  2. The foooood... talk about massive portions. I've only been here for the breakfast, but I've been here a handful of times and never been disappointed. My favorite happens to be the Eggs Benedict with turkey avocado and egg. It reminds me of those beautiful day's in San Diego eating avocados all day.. and also, hash browns. Always hash browns.  Their breakfast sandwiches are also amazing, they come between Texas toast and you can do bacon, have, sausage or chorizo. The biggest platter they have to have here is the country fried steak and eggs. ITS MASSIVE. A must order.  3. The location, its conveniently located off of Tatum and Bell so parking is easy and convenient.  Will be coming back soon!

The employees here are always really helpful and knowledgable when it comes to produce and where you would go to locate the littlest of things. I also feel like the people at checkout are genuinely nice, not fake nice which is refreshing to experience.  Pricing is reasonable, more so then Safeway but that's strictly for the food. I was looking for a can opener the other day and the basic one is still like 9 dollars. Like what? The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because they don't have a meat department (how is this possible?) so I can never get my fresh tilapia here, I have to go to Safeway. (First world problems) and that their beer selection blows. Their "create a 6 pack" has the same exact options of what you can get in a 12 pack, unlike my old frys had an ENTIRELY different selection with a TON of different options.  But be careful in the parking lot, people drive like crackheads and I've almost been hit a handful of times.  also if you've read my tip Deborah is gone. Mwuahaha
