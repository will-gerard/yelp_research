I know you die hard yelpers think chain restaurants are EVIL, but I have never had a bad meal here. The glazed carrots are as "sweet as yams" but makes you think your eating healthy... Cause there carrots.

Bad Pizza, very bad pizza... I think most people are being very generous to say it's OK. I love the atmosphere here, the organ is great... Very bad pizza. I can only imagine how great this "once every 5 year" place could be if they had even "good" pizza, it would not even have to be great! Another yelp-er, compared this place to going to the grand canyon, you know, something you got to do.  I agree you need to go here... I actually brought my own pizza from Old Chicago, the last time I went... No one even tried to stop us. I think the wait staff understood, every time they passed our table they smiled. We got ice cream for desert and also left a big tip... This place has Pizza in it's name I would give more stars if they called it Organ World and charged for admission.

This is the kind of place you go to be left alone... We love that you can walk to "Lon's" from your room. Beautiful grounds tucked away in a Paradise Valley neighborhood with close up view of Camelback Mountain. The History of the place and artist Alonzo Megargee is also interesting. Very laid back atmosphere... Don't expect full services or a ton of attention. If I was going to suggest only one place for someone to experience an "Arizona" overnight, it would be The Hermosa Inn with Lon's for dinner.

HOT DOG!!! I was turned on to this place from a fellow yelp-er, complaining about another joint I was at last week, the Sonoran Hot Dog is all I have had here. Very good.

I see five reviews here all five stars!? Somethings gotta give...  now before you start thinking this a is five star restaurant or some "fancy" place hear me out. I have never given a place five stars before, and truthfully I might have given my regular high review of 4 stars here, but I did not want to detract from the other reviews. I can say this place is one of the best places for "what it is". .. You know the type of fast Mexican food like Filberto's or Rigoberto's and the like? Maria's  is better than that but kinda like that... You got to give it a try! Just had the steak & egg breakfast burrito this morning... GREAT! the hot sauce is killer too.  Updated: 9-3-2012, the last time I went there, they seem to have sold to someone else. Not as good.

I have been here a few times but never tried the Mex, part of the menu. The Burgers are great, I always ask the person at the check out, how they like it cooked, and it is always different, but tasty. The Smoke from the fire they cook on makes my eyes water it is so strong...

I had a Haven Burger. I have been waiting for a pastrami burger place to open up in my area for a while, fell in love with www.crown-burgers.com years ago. Also a plus is that they "grill fire" the burger too. It was not as big as pastrami burgers I have had at other places, but then again, it was a little less money too. Very tasty. I'm gonna be the mayor, check foursquare and see.

Not your regular smoothie shop, I was introduced to this place by a "health nut" friend of mine. He goes all the time. They even have a bowl named after him. Not sure what is the difference but you can ask for "Cody Style" and they will know what you mean. I was surprised that it seemed to fill me up, or that I felt full quite a long time after eating a bowl. And it tastes good too! Chocolate coconut is my favorite.

I have to give these guys the highest marks. I have been eating a no sugar, no flour diet for a while now (eating like a caveman!), so I am used to getting the weird and annoyed looks when I ask what is in the food or salad dressing. But I have to say these guys at Smashburger must have a corporate culture that teaches... "make the customer happy" and do it in a "happy way". Everyone from top to bottom went out of there way to get my questions answered and give me sugestions on how to order to accommodate my eating style.  The food was good and fresh, and since they moved in right across the parking lot from my office, I will be eating there a lot. They gave me a hint that you might want to try, if you want to avoid the salad dressing ask for the Smash Sauce (olive oil they use for the fries) that has some herbs already in it, then use the fresh lemon slices and make your own dressing. Way to go Smashburger!
