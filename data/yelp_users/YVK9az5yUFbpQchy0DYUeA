If you walk out of this place and you are not happy you need to see a shrink.  Probably best people in town (i know people love to debate that).  But if you love BJ's pizza Newport Beach, this is the place to go.  Amazing staff, amazing food, amazing ambience.  You heard it here.  Plan accordingly, the place is packed!!  PS, buy yourself one of their funny shirts (like "Legalize Marinara") as I did.  Classic!!

Very good place.  NIce romantic ambience.  Great wines, and good food. Small parking area, but okay.  Good place to meet with your business clients.

This is a local joint for me, and my wife and I have been here many times.  We drive by all the time and they always look busy (parking is not the easiest).  But we went in last night and WOW - AMAZEBALLS!  Was really good, ambience is great, staff top notch and attentive - just the way I like it.  We started with the eggplant arugula and goat cheese appetizer. Sounds disgusting, I know, but WOW - delicious.  Also had the steak tacos, which were really good with two different sauces to choose from.  Add a glass of the house Syrah and wowza!~  We also got the Cowboy steak (mostly to take home for steak tacos in the morning) and another home run.  At the end of the day, we looked at each other and said "WHY DON WE COME HERE MORE OFTEN".  So, with that being said, we are going to be there more often.  This place is right up there with Hillstone for me (which as some of you might know), is my #1 Arizona hangout.  One recommendation would be to beef up you Pinot selection.  That seemed to be lacking, and didn't love the ones that were available after sampling those.  Go there are try this place, I don't think you will regret it.  Tell them Attorney Steve sent you!   Hahahaha  Have fun, and find your sizzle!  Attorney Steve, the business and real estate lawyer. http://www.attorneysteve.net

Cheesecake factory has a lot of things going for it.  Great food, outstanding selection of dishes and appetizers, comfortable ambience, and pretty good service.  I am a fan for sure.  One thing I don't like is whenever they bring you something with a dipping sauce of any kind, they bring it in a tiny dish and you always have to ask for extra.  Okay, maybe I am just a pig and eating too much sauce.....but seriously, would be nice to at least ask "is that going to be enough sauce or would you like an extra one."  Anyway, I am nit picking (otherwise I wouldn't be much of a critic), but the place is great on all other fronts!  Well done gang.  Steve

This is the best restaurant in Arizona if you love (1) amazing food (2) exceptional ambiance and (3) best in class service.  If you are visiting in Arizona, and want the best of the best go here.  I have done all the fancy steak houses, ruth chris, maestro's etc., but this is the best place to go for a great night of dining with friends.  It's only missing a couple things, (a) easy parking (the place is freaking packed all the time) and (b) a great view (it's on camelback).  But hey, camelback is on the new monopoly board so perhaps I stand corrected.  But no views.  Sit at the bar for the most fun.  The bartenders are AMAZING and fun!  Surprise yourself with the sushi roll, and don't forget to try the salmon appetizer.  YuMSville.  Since it is my favorite in greater phoenix area (so far that is) I give it my top raking!  See you there!

I am sorry, this is one place I just cannot stop raving about.  We had a law firm night out last night and went to our #1 goto - Hillstone.  As always service was amazing, the sushi was best in town, and the beef dip cannot be beat.  Jamie our waitress made the night absolutely perfect in every way, as did the rest of the team.  Weird to find a restaurant where you cannot find any negatives.  Keep up the good work Hillstone, see you again soon!

Okay, the food is not the BEST mexican food in the world.  But sit in the bar area, it is real cozy with a nice authentic vibe.  Just good people having a good time.  No meat market here or anything.  Chips and salsa are good, but again, not the best.  Staff is awesome and they will really take care of you.  Ask for "Jose" - he will take care of you.  Tell him attorney steve sent you.  When he looks at you funny, just ask him for some hornitos!

Ordered a pizza, slow as molasses.  That being said, everyone has a bad day.  This place is one of my favorites in Arizona.  Try the plain pepperoni (don't need to get too fancy, this is a winner).  Addon the antipasta sale, and "suicide wings" and you are good to guy.  For the courageous at heart - go with the Philly Cheesesteak pizza (a super surprising treat).  If you get delivery, don't forget to ask for parmesan and peppers (they never bring it no matter how much I tip - which is always very generous).  Oh well.  Have fun, and find your sizzle!

Lame policies.  You turn in a car a 1/2 hour late (at the airport) you get hit with late fee of $24.30.  Not sure the other big boy rental companies are much different, but for what its worth I would look to a different company next time.  Maybe there is a company out there that has a short grace period for returning a car to the airport.

This company is a total joke.  I try to run a law office using their printer.  The printer is a constant problem, and their support is not afraid to be rude to you because their stuff doesn't work.  Not impressed with this company and will be dropping them when the contract is up no question about it.

This is a really great burger joint and I have always known that.  I stopped in with my wife the other day for a beer and a burger.  I noticed they had a "hot dog" on the menu.  Being German ancestry, I could not resist ordering it just to see how a classic burger joint works the hotdog.  THE THING WAS AMAZEBALLS.  I really loved it.  Of course, I got a cheeseburger as well because I would not have slept if I didn't get a burger there.  As always, really great service, great atmosphere, and food that satisfies.  Will be back soon

This, of course, is one of the greatest places to go and hang out.  It is like BEER HEAVEN if you ever want to try a new flavor and sick of the routine choices.  Place is amazing, great service etc.  Had the burger (3 on a five scale) and salad (average in many respects).  You can't go wrong as far as a place to hang out and do business deals etc.  One thing - if you are going to buy a t-shirt (I bought two of their shirts which are really nice and comfortable), make sure you buy it WHILE YOU ARE SITTING AT THE TABLE, we had to wait around 15 minutes after we closed out our bill just to pay for the shirts. Such is life I guess.  At any rate, definitely fan of the Yardhouse and have been to multiple locations!  Go for it!  PS Tried to buy the yardhouse hat but when you take the sticker off the bill, it shows a round circle there (need to fix that, it's like the products you buy that you can never get the sticker price off).  PSS Don't let me forget to mention they have the BEST music rolling there (I am not going to say what it is - you will have to go for yourself and check it out) but let me say BE CAREFUL you could use an application like Soundhound and spend more money on iTutnes songs than you pay for eating!! FUN PROBLEM TO HAVE THOUGH!!!  PSSS The BEST hamburger in town is at Bobby Q's off the 17.  I have a review on that.  Trust me on that one.  Find your sizzle!  Great job guys!!  Have fun, and find your sizzle!  Attorney Steve, the business and real estate lawyer. http://www.attorneysteve.net

Here's the deal.  You want to take your in-town guests to a place with the ABSOLUTE best views in town?  Then this is the place.  If you want to take them to the place with the best food in town, this is NOT the place.  In fact, I think for the price, if you get the steaks, and even the salad, i think you will be a little disappointed, especially with the prices they charge.  And whatever you do, when they offer you the choice (which I often find to be a tacky maneuver) "do you want tap water or bottled water" makes sure you do the BOTTLED water.  The tap water tasted, well, like tap.    At any rate, because this is the best and most amazing view in town, i will be going back for the rotating 360 views.  I will also ask to sit in the "party section" (which is tables that look more fun than the other dining tables they have, and I am going to find SOMETHING on that menu that actually tastes good.  I agree with some other posts I have seen, you cannot go wrong with the CORNBREAD, but I need to find something else that's good (man cannot live on cornbread and butter alone).  Blue cheese salad was disappointing; mac and cheese so-so, fried asparagus so-so, pig tacos were not bad, and the tamale dish was so-so (yes, we sampled as this was our first time).  Honestly, they need to find a new meat vendor.  Just not very tasty (even for street tacos the next morning).  Anyway, I love the concept so i will go back and try again.  Will report back after next time in.    ATTORNEY STEVE TIP:  To have a fun time with your business guests, friends, out of state guests, etc., do a play at the Herberger Theater and then walk across the street to this place.  Can't beat it.  Have fun, and find your sizzle!  Attorney Steve, the business and real estate lawyer. http://www.attorneysteve.net

Great place. Top rating.  Cool restaurant, great vibes, friendly people, outstanding food and nice bar area. This is a can't miss.  Cornbread and awesome BBQ, brisket/ribs and mac n cheese that will blow you away.  Oh yeah, the "thank you donuts" - incredible.  Might as well order a dozen of those babys take my word for it! I found my sizzle here. Ask for Tiffany, she is awesome!!  See ya there.  UPDATE: I ordered the hamburger there and FORGET ABOUT IT - THIS IS THE BEST BURGER IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA.  The staff here, in my opinion (aside from Hillstone which is equally as good) is the best you can find anywhere.  Other restaurants should figure out how they hire people and pay them to figure it out.  I have been to hundreds and hundreds of restaurants across the United States, you won't find better.

This is a real fun hidewaway in Phoenix.  You have to put it on your list and stop in now and then.  The staff and peeps there are really friendly and accommodating.  The food is also very good (unbeatable salad bar) and some pretty good steaks.  Had the ribs but did not care much for it.  Fun bar area as well if you go on a monday-thursday when they are not crowded (bar only holds about 10-12 or so).  Anyway, mark it in your books and we'll see you there!!

Okay, so the service isn't that great.  And okay the chicken wings are just so-so (I love the breaded 911 wings, so I like the wings, just seems many of my friends don't.  All that squacking aside, you still can't beat the location of Tempe Hooters, or the spirit and energy of the local peeps.  Are the girls the hottest of all Hooters girls no, but you still can't beat the whole thing all put together.  It's a good time.  When you are done, go up one floor to the rooftop and check that out.  Tell em Attorney Steve sent ya!

This is a review of the District, the restaurant inside the Sheraton.  This is really one of the nicest and classiest places I have seen in a while.  The restaurant and bar area (there are two of them actually) are SHEEK, really nice.  We had a $100 coupon we bought at a charity event, and we went on a day when we knew it wouldn't be crowded.  They have amazing art work on the wall, and the waitress was really friendly and attentive.  They have Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale, which I really like, but which is usually hard to find.  I would go for that reason alone.  As for the food, and appetizers (we tried a bunch and two steaks) honestly not very good, and I am not sure what dish I would order if I ever went again.  I honestly think they need to get a food consultant in there to help them with the flavors.  But because the place was really nice and lavish, and because I would go back to sip on the oak creek while watching a game (it would also be a great place for a business meeting), I am still going to be a fan of this place.  Just FYI if anyone reads this, you gotta work on the food, at least come up with one killer appetizer!!  If you are in downtown Phoenix, give it a try and let me know if you agree.

Zinburger is one of those places you have to go to when you are in Phoenix.  The restaurant is right off Camelback across from the Ritz Carlton in the Phoenix financial district (i.e. great location).  The food here is ZINTABULOUS.   My wife and I had the Chicken lettuce burger with Franks Hot Sauce!  Aw yeah, that is awesome!  We also had a burger that was phenomballs and sampled the fried zucchini (which was also absolutely delicious) and threw in the Chili fries just to sample - BWOZA, another winner!!  We took part in the happy hour (before 6 p.m.) which offered some killer pricing and selection, and watched a ball game on tv overlooking the city scene in the background.  The only thing better than the food was the service.  The waitresses and hostesses are so friendly and personable that you feel like you don't want to leave!!!  That is how you do it.  Zinburger is a great place with a great vibe and this is one of my Phoenix Fav's.  Get the chicken sandwich with Franks Hot Sauce and tell em Attorney Steve sent you!  PS.  Our waitress was Kira, ask for her.....she is simply the best!  - Attorney Steve -  http://www.attorneysteve.net

Okay, downgrading my last review.  One of the hallmarks of a great restaurant is its people (friendly conversationalists score the highest marks), consistency in food and general overall treatment.  Went there today to meet an old colleague of mine.  Ordered the mac and cheese as I thought that was good last time I had it (I must have had my places wrong, I think it must have been the Garage, across the street).  I think they changed the mac and cheese recipe.  IIf I liked it before, it tasted pretty plain and uninteresting this time around.  I had five bites and sent it back.  The waitress seemed perplexed, and went about her way.  Thereafter, I ordered the Chicken "Vings" which were pretty good, but not really amazing or anything to write home about.  While I was drinking my drink, I noticed there was a large crack in the glass and I told my waitress about it (yes, that is a serious safety risk).  She brings me back my drink filled up at about the 1/4 level (which was less than I even sent it back with).  If a place is that CHINTZY and feels that way about THEIR CRACKED GLASSES, then it is not the type of place I will go back to.  A classy place would have apologized for the inconvenience at the very least.  instead, they wanted me to feel stupid for raising the point. Later guys, I will take my business to the whining pig around the corner, or the the garage.  Good place, there is fun to be had, but customer service is everything especially with my routine 25% tips.  Someone else will appreciate it I am sure.  Friendly suggestion - throw a little more cheese in your mac and cheese, it won't hurt your profits that bad!!  Peace out.    Find your sizzle!!  Attorney Steve

Man, it seems I have been giving a lot of two stars lately.  I was in the mood for a burger and in the Scottsdale area with my nephew.  We decided to give Lush Burger a try.  We sat outside (first off - BAD IDEA - there are FLIES everywhere trying to take a nibble off your gobble).    First, we ordered the chicken wings - completely MEDIOCRE at best (I am a wing junkie and this is one I would never order again, respectfully).  From there, ordered the burger, fries (both regular and truffle) and we each got a burger (I went with the "Western" which is basically like a carls Jr. "western bacon cheeseburger."  Burger was pretty good (Gigantic, even a big mouth like me had trouble taking a bite if you like those kinds of burgers) but not amaze balls or anything like that.  Finally, being a foodie connoisseur, tried their deserts.  Lush was pretty good in this area.  Had their peanut butter shake - DELISH, and their cinnamon donuts (Lushpuppies I think they call them), also very good although seemed like they were not fully deep fried in the middle, but all in all the deserts were the best part of the meal.  Attorney Steve Tip: When I ate here, (while chewing) the thought kept occurring to me "I wish I was at Bobby Q's" off the 17th.  That is the best burger around, and their cinnamon donuts (FREE AT THE END OF YOUR MEAL) are better than Lush.  I know this is completely digressing and on the other side of town, but if it were me, I would take my nephew to Bobby Q's next time.  IN fact, I told my nephew that.  You might want to do yourself the favor and head their in the first place if you are looking for the KILLER BURGER.  I wrote a review on them so check that out for more specific information.  Anyway, when I start daydreaming about other restaurants, that is when I pull out the two star.  Sorry guys, your place seemed real nice and all (waitress and staff were exceptional, let me not forget to give a shout out for that) but I don't think I will be stopping in again.  Peace out  Find your Sizzle!  Attorney Steve, the business and real estate lawyer  http://www.vondranlaw.com

This place is pretty much the bottom of the food chain.  I just stopped by the drive through counter and ordered lunch.  First off, the gal at the window was REALLY RUDE and condescending.  Not sure why, I was just there to buy lunch and support the place and give it a try.  When I got the food home, the order was wrong, and the taco salad was tiny.  At any rate, I would recommend this place only to people I did not like!  Hahaha.  Seriously, would NEVER go back.  Don't let me forget, food was not very tasty, the taco shells sort of have that greasy taste.  Not for me.

Stopped in with my wife for a late dinner.   Bean and cheese burrito was good, but the rest was just so-so and for some reason the servers were not very friendly.  Projecting negative energy creates a negative environment.  We had been there one other time and it was better service-wise, but not very impressive this time around.  If you like friendly personal service, I don't think this place will impress you.  Food is okay, but in my opinion not amazing.  We wont be going back anytime soon.

I am going to update my review on the Garage.  This is a local place that we stop in to from time to time on our local bike rides.  I have to say, after going there yesterday I am pretty much done with the place.  The food is okay, not great, but okay.  We ordered the chicken wings and when we got the bill there was a $3 charge for celery.  Okay, I get it you have to make money, but that could at least be brought up in advance (which the waiter falsely claimed he did bring up).  I don't know any other restaurant that charges $3 for celery when you order the chicken wings.  Geex, if we would have got got carrots I guess it would be $6 just for carrots and celery.  Anyway, that was just one of the issues.  The other issue was the lack of energy and enthusiasm from the servers.  I know its not an easy job, but there was a general "doom and gloom" vibe which doesn't work for me when I am out trying to have fun.   For me, I won't be going back, and my guests were not overly impressed any more than I was.  For me, I would say hit the Vig across the street, The Whining Pig, or try the Swizzle.  I have reviews on those.  Much better in my opinion.  I would shut the garage door respectfully.

The woman sales rep who helped us buy over $1,500 in glasses a few months ago was very nice and helpful.  However, when one of the new glasses (an $800+ pair) lens recently popped out, customers should realize that after 30 days there is no return policy.  You would think at a high-end store like this, that they would care about you a tad bit more than the "that's and easy fix.....here just let me put a screw in that" response.  So this is just a general rating and tip - would have expected a replacement pair, or store credit, or maybe even a free lunch card for having to bring in a pair of glasses for repair that I HAVE ONLY WORE THREE OR FOUR TIMES.  I will steer clear from this place next time around.

Friendly people, but man, food is marginal at best and seating is not comfortable.  It's like they spent $500 buying furniture for the place.  Don't take your best guests here.  Not hitting the mark for me.  This was my second try, and that will be the last.

This place is basically a joke.  Bought a $6,500 jacuzzi and two months later pump goes out on one of the loungers.   We called them to get them to come fix it or replace it (seems to be a lemon) and although covered by a warranty there is a "$50 travel/gas charge" to come out and look at it.  Of course they don't explain that to you when you are signing the papers.  It's been almost seven days and they are still not out looking to fix it (now they tell me it will be another two days before they can come out).  Is this the type of customer service you want when you spend that kind of money on a luxury item?  They should be ashamed of themselves.  Last time I do business here. Disappointing for sure.

You have to be drinking the cool aid if you like this place.  Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere is charming and the staff is great (two things that are super important in dining).  But if you want a great meal and a fair price, this is not the place for you.  Portions were TINY in comparison to the PRICE.  Food was okay, nothing to write home about.    It's funny, at the end of the night my wife and I said "wow, the best thing we tasted were the french fries."  At any rate, after a $350 bill with tip NOT SUPER IMPRESSED.  I would not go back based on that.  If the food was AMAZEBALLS, then maybe, but it wasn't that.    When I got home I ate a Cliff bar so at least I had something to eat.  Place doesn't work for me, if you want to just blow cash and say you were there then fine.  For a great meal I would (and will be) looking somewhere else.    Again, no disrespect to the staff, which were very attentive.  Have fun, and Find Your Sizzle  Attorney Steve, the Business and Real Estate Lawyer.  http://www.attorneysteve.net

I haven't been here for a year or two.  We always drive by, and the first time I was there is was really good but for some reason we just never made it back. Wait, now I remember, it is the tough to find parking.  Well we popped by to see if they were busy yesterday and we got a parking spot right on front (what do you know).  We sat in the bar area and I have to tell you, this is a hidden gem in Phoenix.  Well not exactly hidden as it has a great corner property facing out toward Camelback, but I mean hidden as in you need to go check it out.   The service was TOP NOTCH (Hillstone caliber which is always my benchmark), but I have to tell you I think Central Bistro is right there.  The one downside, I ordered the thai steak salad, I have to say I didn't LOVE IT (if I would have loved it I would have dished out the FIVE STAR DADDY).  It was good but not great.  The bread and cheese dish there however is AMAZEBALLS and I will be back soon to try a few more things on the menu.  Its a very classy place and one I will bring my future business clients to.  Well done!!

This is a mixed review.  This place has some good things going for it, and they missed the mark in a few areas. First, great location.  RIght above Hooter's in downtown Tempe with a rooftop deck.  Very cool.  Will be back next time the weather is perfect (;like right about now) and hang out up there.  Next, the people were really friendly, which is another big deal when I deciding on whether or not I like a place.  SO good on this angle.  Very friendly and attentive.  Now, they only serve one type of food (brats) and my issue is (a) it took forever to actually get on (like 45 minutes) and (2) not very tasty on the brats (I didn't even see a condiments bar unless I missed it).    I bought two dawgs, one for me and one for a friend, and I took a bite of one and left them sitting on the counter (no good at all).  I think with due respect those need to be changed out PRONTO!!  Get some Kobe beef franks, and some sliders so you have at least a basic menu.  And it can't be that hard to crank out some nachos.  ONce you get that nailed, you should take on the hooters wings (the floor below).  Theirs are good not great.  So, hopefullly there willl be some improvements coming, and once that does, I will be a bigger fan.

I am going to have to join the mainstream on this one and give this place a TOP 5 Rating.  The pizza here is sooooooo gooooood.  The staff is amazing, good specials to choose from, and great location with fairly easy parking (sitting inside is cool, but I suggest getting a patio seat when the weather is rocking).    This is a great place to ride your bike too as well.  Didn't love the meatball appetizer and would not recommend that, but everything else was top notch.  Good enough to earn my highest rating.  Go there, get the pepperoni pizza straight up and tell them Attorney Steve sent you.  have fun and FIND YOUR SIZZLE.

Sam Fox restaurant.  Its the combo of a play-yard (ping pong and cornhole - no not that kind) and drinks, sometimes a band, and good peeps.  Good place to go hang out.  Fun lively atmosphere, etc.  Parking you should plan on valet due to good size crowds (even on sunday).  I cannot comment on the food much as I have only had a few appetizers, which were good.

I am adding an update. I went here again last night (okay, I might be an addict).  Yes, as always we rode our bikes along the canal to get here and hitched them up at the bike rack (yes, you have to love a restaurant with a bike rack inside).  We chose spoke and wheel for two reasons: (1) They have a bunch of TV's and we wanted to watch some sports in comfortable booths, and (2) We love their hot dogs and my buddy Dave and I wanted to do a "dog throwdown."  This is the place to do it.  Their sonoran dogs are amazing.  Whooops, I forgot, there is a #3 reason - you get 1/2 off pricing if you ride your bike.   I think most of us are now familiar with the amazing "Attorney Steve Dog" (no it's not on the menu and you might get some funny looks if you try to order it) which is a sonoran dog with an impressive mixture of nacho cheese and jalapeno - with a side of bacon to boot.  I know, your mouth is watering right?  Well my buddy Dave has been going on and on about "Dave's Dog" which he claims is the best sonoran hot dog in the world, (okay, at least the best dog on Central Avenue in Phoenix....hahahah I had to take him up on that).  Anyway, his dog has nacho cheese, mac & cheese and buffalo sauce on it.  I know, that is a pretty mouth-watering concept and a formidable competitor to the Attorney Steve Dog for sure, so we had to know who's was best.  We decided to conduct a sonoran dog throwdown and ordered a couple Dawgs for some other great folks at the bar (it was a birthday party).  The waitress Jennifer (awesome gal, best we have had) brought the Dave's Dog and the Attorney Steve dog over to the table of guests who were kind enough to help us resolve this pending challenge.  There was a lot of chewing going on, and a lot of back and forth raised eyebrows.   There was also a LOT OF FUN.....which is why we love this place.    If you want to know who the sonoran dog throwdown you will have to watch this video.  https://vimeo.com/75118756  As usual, this was yet another great time at the spoke and wheel.  Jason, the manager is also an awesome dude, and he came out to say hi and to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal adding a real nice touch to the evening.  What kind of sonoran dog can you create at the spoke and wheel?   Keep us posted!  - Attorney Steve -

This is a fantastic place.  I went here for lunch (first timer) just to check the place out and sample a few of their offerings.  Firs, our waitress was Francesca, and she is off the charts amazing, very attentive and personable.  When you go in ask for her and tell her "Attorney Steve sent you off Yelp"  As far food, I tried a few things I didn't love, but found paradise in the doublecheeseburger, macaroni and cheese (make sure you ask for double cheese or you will get a noodle dish).  There are sports TV"s EVERYWHERE, which is amazing, but also a very cool rustic cowboy theme that is really fun.  As for the beer, they had a nice selection, best bet is the "Manly size" (more bank for your buck - plus all those cute girls there will look at you funny if you roll up for the "woman's beer" as they call it.  Go big or go home as they say.  All in all, we will not be driving by and missing this place as much as we have done.  Its a great place to head to when you want burgers, beers, sports, and hot friendly waitresses in a cool environment.    Well done gang!  Attorney Steve Vondran, Esq.

Positives first.  Best sports bar in town.  More TV's per square foot than I have ever seen.  Place was beautifully done.  Ambience is very nice.  Negatives, if you are more into getting awesome food then you might be dissapointed.  Straight up, the food just isn't great for me.  This is a place I will only stop in if there is a big sports event.  Again, great place but "i've experienced better" sums it up nicely.

My wife and I dropped in for a bit Monday evening.  Place was not super crowded, but busy.  Service was horrendous.  We sat there unaknowledged (is that even a word) with no one saying hi, offering a water, or anything for like 5 minutes.  That being the case, we took our business elsewhere.  Not very impressed at all.  Head over to Richardsons if you want great service and good mexican food.  We won't be going back unless we get desperate for variety.

Okay, another SLAM DUNK to report in Phoenix area.  Bootleggers is a great place off Shea and the 51.  Get to Shea and you are there.  Environment was cozy, cool music, great prices and friendly staff.  Need I say more?  Probably not, but you know I will anyway.  The BBQ here is phenomenal.  I saw the BBQ smoker in the back and if that doesn't make you hungry there is something wrong with you.  We ordered the hot wings (good), the hamburger (great, right up there with my all time valley favorite Bobby Q's - of the 17) and the pulled pork with coleslaw on top (AMAZEBALLS)!!    The general manger Jacob came over.  Guy is as cool as it gets.  We enjoyed a cold beer (Oak Brown Nut Ale of course), oh yeah, and THEY SELL MOONSHINE!!  Oh yeah.......try the one with applce cider flavoring - DELISH.  At any rate, place is like one year old, great vibe, so get out there and give them some business.  Aside from Bobby Q's (which also gets a 5) this is a repeat visit waiting to happen and the best on this side of dodge.  Parking is a breeze and this place will not disapoint.  Thanks for making this fun guys.  Have fun, and Find your Sizzle.  Attorney Steve, the Business & Real Estate lawyer http://www.attorneysteve.net

Wow i havent dished our a one star in a while but this place definitely earned it.  Stopped in to try it out for a working lunch today.  First problem you have to park underground and get a ticket to park.  Next, negative vibe by the guy host at front door who also brings the negative vibe when he pours you water (no smile or talking).  I always say if you dont have a great personality that is okay, just dont have a job where you interface with the public.    Next chips and salsa.  Chips tasted stale or they might just use bad oil.  Salsa was okay but certainly not amazeballs.    Finally, steak and pork tacos.  YUCK both were really not very tasty.  Although we asked for a togo container after taking a few bites (just to be nice as i wouldnt serve it to a pet if i had one) we dumped it in the trash first chance we got.  Pinto beans were totally runny loke cafeteria food.  They do validate your parking ticket. so after yout dissapointing meal you can navigate underground road ragers.  Lol  On a positive note, decor was really nice, good internal vibe etc.  place is not for me.  Have fun, steer away from the Fuego. And find your sizzle amigos!

Real interesting place.  A little nook in a retail center transpired into something great.  Another example of Phoenix ingenuity by its owner (a father and son combo).  Go in here and check this place out.  They have games sitting on the counter, tight seating (yes, the back row is a little tight, and stools could be a bit more comfortable - when they are I bump this up to a FIVE STAR), and have a chat with the bartender/owner.  He is a real friendly guy, and he knows his beers.  This is a good place if you want HIGH ENERGY and GOOD SPIRITS.  Swizzle is across the street and you can bounce from A to B and hit the "mystery shot" there.  Fun little corner and a job well done by its owners.  ALSO NOTE - They have the game OPERATION - the old seventies classic.  Ask the bartender for the "free beer challenge."  There is one piece - (human organ, I forget which one) that if you get it out first time without making the light go off I believe you win a free beer.  My friend Dave and i tried.....but you guessed it, we ended up buying our beers!!! Hahahaha  Tell him Attorney Steve sent you, the business and real estate lawyer.  Have fun and FIND YOUR SIZZLE.

This is a real cool place to take a pit stop.  This is the old Aiellos Italian restaurant (a place I really liked) and I have to tell you they did a fantastic job of converting it.  Top notch, complete with co-ed bathrooms.  The happy hour is very appealing as well, and I would say this is a great place to stop in and have lunch (or what the heck, start your friday night).  Chips and salsa were very tasty, and the guacamole dip (with sliced jalapeños - brilliant)!  Good five dollar pitcher specials (sorry, I am never one of those helpful people that can quote you what the time frames are) but I think 11-5).  But worth looking into.  Couple things I will say on the negative side (yeah I know, wish ever review could be positive and amazing), the cheese-mas dip (basically cheese queso) was okay, but NWTC (not worth the calories in my opinion).    Tacos - if you love tacos and are really a connessieur, you might not love these.  The crunchy fish taco was okay, but really just like eating a fish-stick on a tortilla if you know what i mean.  Good, but not a huge fan.  The other tacos (carnitas, chicken tinga, and baja fish) were so-so, didn't seem to be served very warm and for me, just lackluster taste overall.  Alcohol - I tried the "hi-ball margarita" (supposedly their version of the cadillac as I was informed) in my opinion is (how can I say this nicely) not the greatest value.  Try one and see if you agree.  I think they need to up their game in this area.  So at the end of the day, I love the location, love what they have done with the place, great vibe, staff is friendly and very energetic, MUSIC ROCKS (possibly best in town, loud but I like it that way) and so I find myself a big fan, but looking for a go-to meal that I can call my own.  Yes, I will be back hunting for that in round 2 and open to any great suggestions.  And by the way guys, you need to sell some cool t-shirts (love bright colors, great to promote your brand), and give discounts to bike riders.  We like to ride our bikes with friends!!  Have fun, and find your sizzle!  Attorney Steve, the business and real estate lawyer. http://www.attorneysteve.net

Okay, this will be a rare review for me.  This is a review of a restaurant I have never been to.  My wife went there tonight to meet her mom and to see what all the rave was about.      Apparently, this place KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK.  My wife called me on the way home and said "Oh my god, this is the best place I have ever been to and it blow the Henry away (see my review on Henry).  I thought wow, glad you really enjoyed it.  She then informed me that she had a "take home surprise" for me.  Yep, there was a task little sampler platter she brought home so I could try it.  The sampler consisted of Short Ribs (AMAZEBALLS), and the Pork Belly Appetizer (also incredible), the grits with jalapeño pieces (WOWZA), the smoked salmon appetizer (TAH DYE FOH) and last but not least the Key Lime Pie (BEST KEY LIME I HAVE EVER HAD).  Needless to say, on a pure food level it gets my highest ranking (as it did for my wife and mother-in-law as well).  But if you have been reading Attorney Steve's "find your sizzle reviews" you know that food is only part of the equation, and service and environment must also be weighed and factored in.  Again, I was not there, but I have it on good information that they KILLED IT in these areas as well.  I will quote my wife (now this is hearsay, but I believe it is an exception to the hearsay rule "the excited utterance" if you are a legal buff).  Here is what she says:  1.  "When you walk in you feel like you are in someones beautiful comfy warm home";  2.  "The service, (including the chef coming over and asking how the meal was), to the friendly servers who did the same, and to Jordan who went above and beyond to make sure our first time there was phenomenal.  He hit the mark, as did all the others."  3. "I have been to a lot of very, very very nice restaurants in my life time and I have never been treated as well as I have tonight at Grassroots."  So there you have it folks.  If you don't go to this place you are MISSING OUT.  The only concern we now have is that with this and other positive reviews we will no longer be able to get a table when we go there (I am sure they would come up with a solution for that as well).  At any rate, this is a MUST TRY - get  out, get it done and go here!    Enjoy, and find your sizzle!  Attorney Steve, the Business and Real Estate Lawyer http://www.AttorneySteve.net

I always believe that people and companies are judged on the little things they do.  The small things that maybe nobody notices.  This place is amazing for sure, and lot's of fun (will be going back at some point).  HOWEVER, the valet guy was a TOTAL CHEESEBALL that pulled the "All I have is 8 bucks do you want to wait around while I run inside and get change" trick (in response to a $20 bill toward the end of the night).  I just find that to be so obnoxious from a classy place. If I were in management I would have a talk with the blond hair bozo and tell him to treat your best guests with respect, and not with some cheesy line to try to fool someone into giving a big tip.  You would have got the big tip anyway by not being a moron and being professional.  Poor reflection on the establishment and overall experience in my opinion.  Like we would really wait for him to run inside with a busy crowd, go see the cashier and run out.  Just ridiculous.
