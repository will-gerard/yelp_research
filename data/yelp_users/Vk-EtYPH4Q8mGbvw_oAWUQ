I LOVE Salon Karizma! The owner Pam is friendly, professional and is great at what she does! I took my husband to her for a pedicure for Fathers day once and he loved it.   I have been going to Pat for years for all of my hair needs. She is amazing! She has bright new ideas everytime I go in to see her. I have recommended my friends and family to her and they are equally as pleased as I am every single time. Pat listens to your ideas and you will always walk away with a style, cut or color exactly the way you want it.   Go see Pam or Pat to add to your every day beauty!!!!

A friend went in to get pierced by Shane and said it was a fantastic experience. He was very professional, friendly & the shop was clean.  I finally committed and made an appointment and got pierced by Lorna. She was a total doll. Took her time with me, explained everything and was most of all TOTALLY PATIENT. I would for sure recommend this shop for piercing AND tattooing. My husband and I have been tattooed here before and had an awesome experience with both Laney and Jimmy Gee.  Overall, go check out the shop, make and appointment and get some great work done by some great artists.

My husband and I have been going to Uncle Josh for years now. He is super friendly, super professional and most of all, an amazing artist. He has taken great care of us and many friends of ours.  I would reccommend everyone to go check out his portfoilio, his facebook page or go into the shop and meet him and throw him some ideas. You will be pleased with the results for sure.

Anxiously awaited the big opening and finally went. Not impressed. While sitting and picking through the food that we got, we overheard a female manager picking apart and employee! Right on the dining room floor at a few tables away from us. She wrote him up, suspended him and we overheard her disappointment in him.  Poor form lady. Wouldn't an office or even the outside patio be more appropriate?  It was embarrassing for the employee, her and the restaurant.
