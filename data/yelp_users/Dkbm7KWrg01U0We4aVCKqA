My wife and I went on Yelp's Date Night at the AZ Science Center during the final weekend for the Van Gogh exhibit.  What a fantastic experience!  The Van Gogh exhibit was amazing.  Kudos to Sensory4 (the organization that created it) for doing a great job of telling the story of Vincent Van Gogh's life through only his paintings, quotes from his letters to his brother Theo, and music.  It was very moving.  Van Gogh was further cemented in my heart as my favorite painter.  In addition to seeing Van Gogh, Yelp provided some light snacks, a scavenger hunt, and entrance to most of the museum and the Planetarium.  Thank you, Yelp, for arranging this.  it was the 2nd Yelp event my wife and I attended and can't wait to see more.

i love going here.  i'm a music snob/geek who desires the tangibleness of the CD or vinyl over the digital.  and i like supporting local businesses.  this makes places like hoodlums perfect.  they have a small but knowledgeable staff who go out of their way to help you...even to the point of offering somewhere else to purchase a CD if it's cheaper there.  i like honesty.  it encourages me to go back.  if they don't have an album, chances are darn good they can order it.  their always up for a chat about music and consistently have good tunes flowing through their speakers.    i truly don't have a bad thing to say about hoodlums.  they do a lot to support local artists (both music and visual).  it's a great record store with an impressive selection of new & used CDs and vinyl.  they also have a good selection of music-related memorabilia.

Having moved to the area a couple months ago, my wife and i decided to check out one of the neighborhood eateries.  tonight we chose tott's.  we read some of the reviews here on yelp, and they could not be more accurate.  we both thoroughly enjoyed our respective dishes and took advantage of their 2 meals for $20 deal.  1 appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entrees and 1 desert for $20.    the staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean and small but cozy.  there was a constant stream of people coming in for take-out.    the appetizer was 3 nicely cooked spring rolls that weren't greasy and perfectly cooked inside.  they came with a sweet & sour dipping sauce that complemented the spring rolls nicely.    my wife ordered the hong kong stir fry with chicken (sans the mushrooms) and i ordered the orange chicken (their most popular dish).  the portions are large...enough for 2 meals.    the hong kong stir fry was delicious.  the chicken was white meat and cooked well and no 'strange parts' like you sometimes find in stir fry.  the veggies were big chunks and cooked just right...not soggy and not crisp.  the orange chicken was wonderful also.  it had a spicy kick that built as you ate more.  the sweetness from the citrus evened the spiciness out for the most part, combining for a tasty balance.  both came with large portions of rice.    for dessert we ordered the almond cheesecake.  a perfect ending to our meal.  it was light and fluffy with a graham cracker crust that had almonds in the crust.    tott's provided a great experience with great service and tasty food.   a local restaurant that we will definitely go to again.

my wife told me to not go to filiberto's.  i should have listened.  but, being relatively new to the valley (moved here 2 years ago) and a big fan of mexican food, i wanted to try it out.  i'm never...eating...there...again.  large portions of bland, tasteless slop.  the refried beans lacked texture.  the burrito could have been made by a bobble-head doll.  it completely lacked any kind of thought behind it.  ground hamburger rolled up in an amateurish tortilla with the token green pepper.  that was it.  my one question is, how are they still in business?  i'm repulsed by their existence and continued success.  taco bell is an infinitely better option than filiberto's.

a friend and i went to mimita's a week ago for dinner.  it was only my 2nd time partaking in cuban fare, so my taste buds are still experiencing the newness of that region's palette.    we started off with the ejemplar de mimita's sampler (#108 on the menu).  wow.  it alone almost filled us up.  everything on the sampler was practically addicting.  i ordered the picadillo criolle (#302).  it was a bit salty, thanks to the olives it was a bit salty for my taste.  other than that it was a great dish.  i liked the slight sweetness the raisins brought to the tomato sauce.  the prices are reasonable and you get more than your share of food.  i am definitely going there again.    the staff was really friendly and willing to answer any questions we had about the food.

this is the perfect dive bar. it's right off the light rail so if you've had too much you don't have to worry about driving.   the service can be slow, but whenever i go it's with a bunch of friends so we're in no hurry anyway. the food is OK. it can be greasy. but honestly, i don't go there because of the food. it's a great location to hang with friends and have a great time. you never know what's going to happen while you're there. Something out of the ordinary always seems to happen. And it's next to an adult bookstore. what could be better? ;)   as for parking, park across Apache in the parking structure underneath the apartments. make sure you park in the metro/light rail spaces. it's free.

terrible. terrible. terrible. here's why.  several months ago i went to this location to get set up with a cpap machine for my sleep apnea. i i had been previously diagnosed with sleep apnea twice before, but i needed a new machine.   it started off fine. i met with dr. martinez to review my history & explain my situation. she was great. after the appointment, she explained what needed to be done to the 2 receptionists out front. essentially they needed to obtain my 2 prior sleep studies, then  submit to insurance for the approval for the machine. i was also in a bit of a rush since i was moving out of state within a month.  simple enough, right?  i followed up about a week later to get a status update. NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE. in fact, apparently no information was in my account regarding the places they needed to get the studies from. i had to explain everything to the person over the phone and provide the contact information again (i provided this during my appointment with dr. martinez also). the lady on the other end of the phone allegedly took the information down.  i again followed up, this time a few days later. they still had nothing. so i decided to take matters in my own hands. i called one place that the sleep study was requested from. they had the request and were going fax it the next day. i then called the 2nd place. they did not have the request. so, they emailed me the release of medical info form. i filled it out, faxed it back to them. they emailed me the sleep study right away. i then faxed to valley sleep center.   long story short, i did their jobs for them. i wouldn't recommend this location. the receptionists do not stay on top of things.

my wife & i went here thanks to a groupon. it's in our neighborhood so we thought it would be good to try out. it turns out that groupon was a great investment.  it's easy to compare I Sushi & Teppan to Benihana. it's the same type of restaurant. Except IS&T is more casual. and more relaxed. Our server was friendly and on top of our orders. We sat at one of the grilling tables. Our chef, Chu, was fantastic. He had some great tricks during his performance that included big flames of fire twice. The food he made for us was wonderfully seasoned and tasted fresh.    The fried rice was great. There were plenty of vegetables with it and it was almost a meal to itself. I ordered the steak for my meal. When Chu thought it was cooked to my liking, he gave me a small piece to taste test. I thought this was a nice touch. Good customer service. He had it right the first time and I enjoyed every bite.   We plan on going again, with or without a groupon.

I've been here several times, and you cannot go wrong here. the food is fantastically done in the MI coney dog tradition. the staff and the owner are extremely friendly and helpful. and they offer faygo. also you can wipe your dirty feet on an Ohio State floor mat.

AZ United is a professional soccer team in the USL, which is currently considered the 3rd tier of US soccer, behind MLS and NASL.  Their 1st season was in 2014, months after they gained the franchise rights from now defunct Phoenix FC Wolves.    They currently play at Peoria Sports Complex, the spring training home of baseball's Seattle Mariners & San Diego Padres.  This, while not a centralized location in the Phoenix area, does provide free parking and ample space.   I've been a supporter of AZ United since it's inception, thanks in large part to being a member of La Furia Roja 1881, one of 3 supporters groups for AZ United.  I love going to the games and enjoy supporting a local professional soccer team.    the team is still figuring out how to gain a solid foothold in the fickle Phx sports market, and a home stadium in downtown Phx would be a great start.  also advertising.  they do the bare minimum of that, which is ironic considering the main owner started Arrowhead Advertising. those are my main gripes about AZ United. oh, and the lack of merchandise.   every time I have the chance, i go to AZ United games.  if you're a fan of soccer, make the trip. it's worth it.
