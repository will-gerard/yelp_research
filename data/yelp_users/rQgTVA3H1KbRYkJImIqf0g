Not a fan of this airport. Gates are such a long walk from the baggage claim, and it takes FOREVER to get your luggage (yes, one day I will learn to not check my bags).  Decent food options, but not great. I think I'm just spoiled because I get to fly out the best airport in the country all the time....PDX.  Sorry, PHX, not looking forward to our next meeting.

I recently ordered some flowers for a memorial service, and I got exactly what I wanted. The arrangements were gorgeous, service was great, and they were delivered at the requested time.  I'm so glad this flower shop was recommended to me, and I would highly recommend them for any flower arrangements you might need in that area.  Thank you Apache Junction Flowers, for doing such a great job!

Ugh - not a fan of McCarran. I've had to connect flights twice here in the last few months, and not only is it incredibly crowded but the seating seems limited to me. Also, not a lot of decent food options for Concourse C, so keep that in mind.   I mean, it's great people watching and the slot machines let you know where you are so no mistaking that. Not looking forward to my next layover here, that's for sure.

Recently stayed at this new property (I was told that the just opened in January 2014), and was very impressed. It's much nicer than some of the other Residence Inns that I've stayed at, and you can tell that it's new.  It's located in Gilbert, which was convenient for me, and near quite a few things (the freeway, hospital, grocery stores, etc.). Bed was comfortable, nice seating area in the studio that I stayed in, and it had the feel of a boutique hotel, which I love.  Service was also really good, and they have both a nice swimming pool and workout room. I would definitely recommend this place, and will probably stay here again in the future.
