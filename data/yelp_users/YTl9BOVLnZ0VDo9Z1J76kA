Worst policy ever, my friend is out of town and needs cash now, I go to the branch to deposit $350 cash green American money not euros but authentic Ben Franklin's. They will not accept my deposit because I am not a signer on the account. Really worried about money laundering at $300 at a time? This is the worst customer service and left their client in a lurch

Went into the store and explained to Alex that I was trying to buy a bed for a single mother to be who was down on her luck and had nothing to sleep on.  He gave me a great deal so that I was able to help out this mother in need with out breaking my bank account.  This will be the place I come back to when I am ready to replace my King mattress because they took care of me on the little things.

I have eatten here a number of times at this new location and delivery and the food has allways been good. This time the service for delivery has been horrific. It has been 2 hours since I originally called and we are still not eating. When I called after the first hour and was told they had the order for pick up in error. This was after I know we discussed a gate code for delivery.  After being told they would only discount 20% for there error, I am still waiting for food 56 minutes after they realized their. You would think my order would have gone to the front of the line, but apparently not. May be my last time here.

I have been using Brothers pool service since last year and they are always on time or have called ahead to make other arrangements such as after a big storm.  Tyler and Greg take great care of my pool and have addressed any problems with my pool quickly and professionally.  It makes it easy to enjoy a sparkling pool year round.  I would highly recommend them to my friends and clients.
