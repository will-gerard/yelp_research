My son has attended this center since he was an infant- we have always loved how much the teachers seem to actually care about the kids.   My son is now a crzy 4 yr old and there have been behavior issues but the teachers and the preschool directors Shannon and Kim have been great in helping us and listening to our concerns- I won't say it's always been perfect but my concerns are always dealt with immediatly.  A few weeks ago my son snuck in a quarter from home-choked on it in class and everyone jumped to help- in the end it was the director Kim who was able to dislodge the quarter and save my son using her first aid skills-- This place is really the only place I would trust with my Lil ones! !

This place was ok-very bright and no music so felt a little odd hearing everyone's conversations-would be much better atmosphere with dimmer lighting asks some music-appitzer was great! Salad great! Dinner was a big disapoitment-had chicken marsala -was so salty I couldn't finish it-wasnt very hot either-if better atmosphere I'd go back and try other things but prob won't b back

I took my 9 yr old daughter to lunch- I was happy to see new sandwhiches added to the menu-- hostess pointed out kiosk on table - my 9 yr old immediatly scans it and checks out the kids games link -said to me O it says 1.99 I tell her O don't touch- we ignore - of course bill comes there is $1.99 charge snuck on there- waitress seems annoyed I asked for it to b removed- beware of these table side kiosks it's a rip off scam and it's completely redicioulous- food was  good- server was ok-

I only go to this Quiznos when I'm craving the brocalie soup since its the best! But I'm so annoyed at the rest of the food quality and the price for what you get! A small chicken sandwhich and med. soup cost me $9.80! Now, if it was actual chicken and not processed chicken pieces and real bacon and not freeze dried out bacon I probably wouldnt complain but with the quality of ingrediants I dont understand how you can charge such high prices. I think this place and company overall would do much much better if they would just improve quality of food they serve. This place doesnt even use real napkins anymore they use restroom like brown papertowls! I'm sure they are one processed chicken sandwhich away from shutting down like most others have.
