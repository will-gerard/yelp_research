Had the buffet.  Loved it!  Food was hot but not overcooked like so many buffets.  Will be back again.

Wonderful staff in a state of the art office. They were able to see us for a major procedure the same day we came in.   Top notch.

I went here for lunch with a few co-workers.  I actually liked the food.  Growing up in San Antonio, I prefer this kind of mexican food: no color only shades of brown, heavy on the cheese, heavy on the salsa.  Wow, now that I write that, I doesnt sound so great... but really, that's what I like.  And that's more or less what I got at Tee Pee's.  So food-wise, it's probably a THREE STAR.  But there were some real drawbacks.  The chips were slightly stale.  It should be a small thing, but you'd think a "landmark" restaurant could handle keeping fresh chips.  The decor is dated and cramped.  The old vinyl seats are ugly, but more importantly, they are uncomfortable and very small.  Two adults sitting side-by-side had better be very friendly.  Finally, the service is horrible.  And to me, that is easily the biggest problem.  The waitress constantly left our drinks empty and had to be reminded every time we asked for anything.  In reality, Tee Pee's should be right up my alley.  But their "we're too busy to worry about the small things" is a big problem.    I'm not sure they will ever get a second chance with me.

It seems like I must not have gone to the restaurant all the other reviewers experienced.  We went to Oregano's in Scottsdale for an office lunch.  There were about 10 of us.  BIG mistake.  We ordered.   We talked.  We drank our sodas.  We waited.  We talked. We drank more sodas.  But mostly, we waited.... and waited... and waited.    After an hour and a half and NO FOOD, half of our party left while the others continued to.... yep, you guessed it... wait.  Was the food good?  I didn't like it.  But then again, when it arrived at my office desk in a carry out box two hours after I ordered it, perhaps I just wasn't in the mood anymore.  One Star.  Sorry, but they earned it.

Thoughts while on the trail:  Nice short hike. Very rocky, uneven surface. Pretty sure half of Phoenix is on the trail with us!  So now that I'm off the trail and back home, I've got to say I really enjoyed the hike today.  The November weather was perfect and made the climb very pleasant.  I took my 7 yr old son with me and he did great.  Although the trail is very rocky and rugged (particularly for an "improved" pathway), it is a simple hike.  I saw a lot of people wearing running shoes, but I've got to admit there is no way that would have worked for me.  It would be super simple to roll an ankle on the jutting rocks.  Plus, I  would think that the soft sole of a running shoe would expose your feet to the rock points.  I wore hiking boots and was happy that I did.  I kept reading about having to scramble over rocks and had imagined needing ropes.  But the fact is, the only rock climbing we did was no more than running up a staircase two at a time.  It really was not a problem.    The real negative for me was all the "company" on the trail.  All my hiking experience up till now has been in more remote areas.  I suppose because Piestewa Peak is located inside a major city I shouldn't be surprised.  But I've got to tell you, there are A LOT of people there.  A few rude, but most very considerate and nice.  Still, hiking like ants in a line is a bit strange.  But I am a fan, none the less.

Love this tiny little airport. Easy parking. No lines. No need to be here hours ahead on departure.

Salty Senorita in Scottsdale... mexican food, football on flat screens, outdoor seating, margaritas!  Kinda sounds like a little piece of heaven to me?  What's not to like, right?  The horrible service.    You might have read the other reviews.  You might be asking yourself if it's really all that bad?  The answer is yes it is.  The little girls they hire to wait tables are across the board worthless.   After watching them I started to question whether or not they literally walk out of their way to avoid seated customers.    It's too bad, because Salty's has all the right stuff... but apparently also has all the wrong people.  If I'm wrong, I'll never know.  After eating there twice and having the same experience, there simply won't be a third time.  Too bad.

I've got to admit, fishing at the Water Ranch pond kind of makes me think of the Beverly Hillbillie's "cement pond".  But I really like it!    The location is perfect; right at the intersection of Guadalupe & Greenfield.  Parking is no problem.  The walk from car to water is little more than a skip, hop and a jump.  Very easy for my elderly dad to take my son fishing.    The fishing is easy too.  The pond is stocked with Trout, Bass, Catfish and Sunfish.  We've been catching nice trout (10-12 inches, Yum!) using nightcrawlers.  I'm keep hearing that white power bait works too.  Although the bottom of the pond seems to have several rocks, snags don't ever seem to be a problem.  Maybe best of all, the edge of the pond is a cement curbed sidewalk.  Like I said, Jethro Bodine would be right at home.  I suppose if you are gonna be an "Urban Fisherman" you might as well do it right!  Not much into fishing?  No problem.  There is a wonderful library with windows looking out over the pond.  There are paths for a nice walk.  There are birds everywhere.  There is even some kind of observatory (haven't checked it out yet, don't know the details).  All-in-all, this place is exactly what you'd want... and more.

I agree with the previous reviewers, this place is AMAZING!  I had the three piece spicy catfish. Outstanding.  Huge portions, lightly battered (not caked). Delicious. I love this place!  Service was great too.  The owner seems like a great guy and truly makes everyone walking in the door feel immediately at home.  If you are anywhere near here, don't miss out.  Note: It's got a small store front, blink and you'll miss it. And missing it would simply be awful.

This buffet is a couple blocks from my house.  My family and I decided to give it a try more for the location than for anything else.  We were all pleasantly surprised.    The food was good and hot.  Let's face it, in the end it's buffet food so it's never gonna be gourmet, right?  But if you hold China City Super Buffet up next to it's peers, it easily stands above the crowd.    The "sushi" (again, it's a buffet, so I didn't go with huge expectations) was good.  There is a BBQ station that was tasty.  The entree dishes were plentiful, varied and well prepared.  I read the review that mentions the servers speaking badly about the customers in Mandarin.  While I did notice that they were very hesitant to speak English with us, I did not get the sense that anyone was making derogatory remarks.  Who knows, maybe ignorance is bliss?  Bottom line, I will be back.  Probably often.  :)

Maybe it's me.  Maybe it was just bad luck.  But I've gotta say, our last (and unfortunately it will probably be exactly that) visit to PF Chang's was just horrible.  Service was slow as always, mainly because the place is typically packed with people.  No problem.  We weren't in a hurry and patiently waited the 30 minutes necessary to get a table.  Our server was attentive and had a fun attitude, so no problem there either.    It was the food that was just unacceptable.  Overpriced for sure, but poorly prepared too.  Orange Peel Chicken was soggy and tasted like it was a three-day old left-over pulled from fridge and reheated in a microwave (really).  My son ordered the salmon and we had to send it back not once, but twice due to being undercooked.  The center was literally raw both times.  The last straw was when one of the junior "managers" came to the table to say that, "We cook the salmon that way on purpose."  Really?  As if it was sushi?  Wow.    Sorry guys, you are just not worth it.
