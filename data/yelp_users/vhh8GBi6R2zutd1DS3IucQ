People keep saying how this place has the best burgers. Well not so for veggie burgers. Seriously, Denny's veggie burger is better. The patty was dry bland mush.

Eating a "Sometimes I'm Vegetarian" sandwich. AMAZING! I have found my new go-to sandwich shop. Such a wide array of things to choose from, no matter if you're a meat-eater, vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free. I little pricey with sandwiches around $8-10. But worth it!
