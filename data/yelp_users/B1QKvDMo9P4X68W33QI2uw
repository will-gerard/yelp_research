First time ever eating here and it was delish. I tried the chicken fried rice bowl combo , which comes with a egg roll and drink. It is a little on the expensive side but not too bad . The food is worth it . The establishment from what I seen of it was clean. The employee was a little gloomy though.  But over all experience was great

Cool concept and good customer service, but for the prices the food is not tastey.  My  brothers chicken was dry and my salmon had no flavor.
