Quaint and cute. But the service and attitude of the owner is far from that.  Its clear that the owner of this restaurant has never worked for any hospitality based business that has the customer in mind. If you've been to The Ritz Carlton...this is the opposite.  If you can slide in without much interaction with the hostess and have all the time in the world for an afternoon with your lady friends...then I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

Co+Hoots rocks for co-working space. Nothing like it in Phoenix metro in my opinion. It's a beautiful balance of creative + programmers + startups + supporting business types (PR, Marketing and the hippest bookkeeper you'll ever meet).  So if you're working at home in your PJ's with no drive, or just roaming from coffee shop to coffee shop, you really owe it to yourself to check out the space at CoHoots. You'll find a place to energize you, support your endeavors and grab some espresso (at the on-site coffee shop) to juice you up. There are multiple meeting rooms available and a flow of cool, passionate people.  If you want to see why I choose it over other options in the valley...check out my blog post at: http://per-se.co/blog/2012/10/21/assessing-options-for-co-working-in-phoenix-az
