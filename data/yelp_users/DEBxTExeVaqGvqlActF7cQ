If you live in Phoenix you need to eat this BBQ! I had the pulled pork and loved it I did need more sauce but I like a tone of sauce.

If you need gluten free this is the place!!! The owner has a plethora of options for you. If you want a special treat have the Turkish coffee. Oh and they have the best lemonade in town be sure to get the biggest one because you will want it.

This place has so much to offer! Talk to the owner he will guide you. If you are gluten free this is the spot where the option is just as important as the smiles. The pita is soooo good. I get 4-5 bags at a time also try the Turkish coffee with a special friend.

John is the best dentist I've ever been to see. I love how he treats me when I'm in his chair. He has never told me that I NEED anything done. I don't feel pressured. It's nice to call and have Todd answer the phone because I say hay Todd its Rion I need to get in and he remembers me. This is a top notch please run by people who know what they are doing. I've been a client for 5 years and my family and I will not go anywhere else!

Its not a easy thing to get this type of food right. My wife and I do mostly home curry sauces but when we go out we eat at Saffron. You will not be disappointed.

The food was average my service was below average the only thing that was consistent was the waitresses opinion of how bad the kitchen was doing and my Tea refills. If you choose to go eat at the crab you will need to use your patience skills.
