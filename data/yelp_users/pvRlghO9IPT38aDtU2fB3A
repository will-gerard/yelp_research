Tonight was our first night visiting Farrelli's - we had purchased a DealChicken coupon and used it as an opportunity for a "date night".  The atmosphere was awesome - chairs were incredibly comfortable and it was truly like watching a movie in the comfort of our home. Thankfully, the place wasn't too busy and it was an older crowd, so no interruptions or rude folks.   We had the queso as an appetizer - definitely not the best. The chips were reminiscent of a Costco-type bulk chip, not the most fresh. For some reason the queso tasted like cigarette smoke - a little strange. But not completely horrible.  I had the house salad for dinner and it was fresh and quite tasty. My husband had the burger which he said was good, but lacked any type of seasoning or flavoring. We did have the popcorn, which was ok, not great. As far as the prices, we found them appropriate.   Service was friendly but definitely not speedy. We hit the light on our table indicator but it took awhile for the waiter to come back. I have a feeling that since it was a slow night there was only a few people working both theaters.  If it were for food alone, it would probably be a 2 - 3 star deal, but the environment and the treat of having a glass of wine while being comfortable and watching a movie bumped it up to 4. We would definitely go back again.

Hard to get some help finding an item despite a lot of staff around. But major plus is they give a discount for products being sent to our military serving over seas!

This place is horrible.  Unfortunately,  because of my insurance,  I had no options.  They called me yesterday and scheduled the appointment for today,  told me to come in at 1:30. I arrived at 1:20, checked-in and paid my co-pay.  At 2:45, I went up to the window to find out sky I hadn't been called back.  She tells me my appointment is on Monday.  Apparently they were going to just have me sit there all afternoon.   The office manager gives me a sob story about how the girl is new,  how they are short-staffed, etc. Yet throughout my 3 hours of storing here in pain with a hip fracture,  the staff is hanging around,  socializing,  laughing.  No sense of urgency,  no courtesy.  At this point I'm a bit terrified to have such an unprofessional company handle my MRI. Stay away!

We are devastated. They were horrible... they were absolutely unprofessional and were, by far, the worst part of my daughter's wedding day. PLEASE do not risk your wedding or special event with this company. I agree with T.L. - I wish there were a NO STAR option.  I had a LivingSocial coupon for 3 hours of limo time. We needed two very short transfers to the wedding location - just 2.8 miles. The first trip was going to be the parents and grandparents of the bride. The second trip was the bride and her four bridesmaids. At most, it would only be about 45 minutes. We requested that the limo show up at 11:45, transfer the first group, and then return for the bride and her attendants.   Because we wouldn't be using the limo for the full three hours, the gentleman at Xavier gave me a "deal" and said he could offer a discount on a town car pickup to bring the bride and group from the reception to their wedding night hotel - 7.7 miles away. Again, a 30 minute trip, at most.  I received a pleasant call the day before her wedding confirming the pick up times and locations. I reviewed everything with the lady at Xavier Limo.  The first pick-up was supposed to be at 11:45 a.m.  I got a call from the limo driver at 11:10 asking for directions from Scottsdale - we live out in far northwest Peoria. The gentleman was quite rude and when he arrived with the limo he didn't come to the door or let us know he was there. We had no idea he was even out there. My parents arrived and said that the driver was out front and he was very impatient, wanting to know when they could leave.   We walked out with my parents to get into the limo and the driver asked where the rest of the party was. We explained that he would be their second trip. He absolutely refused and said that he was only making one trip. And he wanted to leave immediately. Because we didn't want to stress my daughter out and this guy was obviously unwilling to work with us, we just drove up in our car and had the girls take the limo. (And remember, this was only a distance of 5.6 miles round trip).   We left and met them at the location. We found out from my daughter and the bridesmaids that he had to ask her for directions to the location, was very unfriendly, didn't help them into the car, and when they arrived at the location, he wanted to immediately kick them out of the car (even though they were now there 20 minutes too early because of the driver not doing the first run). When they said it wasn't time, the girls said the driver got upset and that the air conditioning was turned way down. Keep in mind, our temperatures yesterday were 118 degrees. Our girls were so hot and sweaty by the time they were walking into the ceremony.   The driver stood outside the limo, texting and looking at his watch while we were preparing to start the ceremony. He kept rushing us along. It was not even 12:25.  Unbelievable!  The town car was scheduled to arrive at 6pm.... and the nightmare continued. The driver arrived shortly after 5 and wanted to have the couple leave immediately. We explained that they were not supposed to be picked up until 6pm. The driver was rude and impatient, just like the first driver. We could not believe that he had the nerve to ask them to leave their reception early!  When the bride and groom came out, he did not help them put their bags in the trunk. He, again, asked them where they were going (which they are both from out of town... is it just me or shouldn't a "transportation" company / drivers KNOW where they are going??).  This was, by far, the lowest class and most unprofessional company that we have ever interacted with. I'm so sad and disappointed that my daughter's very special day was impacted by my bad decision to use this company.
