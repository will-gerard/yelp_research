I only wanted a hand wash today. They REALLY pressured me to upgrade and add leather conditioner. After I argued my way out it, the guy tried to charge me $35 for a hand wash when it says directly on the ticket that it's $25. I had to have the cashier go outside and correct his "mistake." The guy thought I wouldn't notice. Ripoff.

Great food, terrible service. We were repeatedly ignored when we first walked in. It took 10 minutes to get a server and when as asked for extra plates and Parmesan for our pizza, the server just never came back. I have never written a negative review before so hopefully that says something. I will not be returning.

I want to love this place so bad! I like the idea of it but have never been happy when I went in. My boyfriend and I have gone 3 or 4 times and the owner is SO creepy! The first time we walked in he looked at me, then gave my boyfriend a "thumbs up." Then he placed our napkins in our laps for us! So weird. Every other time we went there he acted the same way. All of the other staff was uncomfortably eager to have customers. Its just really uncomfortable in there. And I also have never been that impressed with the food- especially considering the prices. I dont think I will try it again :(

This place is AMAAAAAZING! I feel so healthy after I eat here. The food is excellent, and the service is timely and welcoming. One employee in particular, I think his name may have been Rob, made my whole experience. I told him what  I was in the mood for, and he pointed me in the right direction. I will definitely be back!!!

This place is great! Very friendly and welcoming employees and authentic food.  I was surprised that we were the only customers for dinner on a Saturday. I will be telling my friends to come here!
