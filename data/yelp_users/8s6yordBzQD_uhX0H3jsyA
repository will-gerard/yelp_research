I don't usually feel compelled to review fast food, but this Wendy's location has disappointed me so many times, it deserves a review.  It fails at the primary goal of eating a CHAIN fast food restaurant: consistency.    Depending on when you go there, you might get  a great burger or an almost cold one where the cheese isn't even going to melt.  The staff, as nice as most of them are, seem overworked, frantic at times and poorly trained.  Asking them for a baked potato sometimes elicits a response akin to having asked them to predict the next set of lottery numbers.   This is an example of how to do a Wendy's franchise in the WRONG way.  I don't blame the kids who work there, I blame the management and franchise (?) owners.

I've been going to Thai Food Corner since 2005.   I'm a big fan of their Penang Curry Chicken, Pad Se Ew and Tom Ka Gai soup.  Service is always spot on, the food is consistently good and the prices are great.  If you are looking for a neighborhood style Thai food restaurant in east Mesa, Thai Food Corner should be on the top of your list.

I've been eating at Cafe Mix on a regular basis for the past 2 years.  The freshness of the ingredients and the consistency of the quality are what keeps me coming back.  The salad they serve with entrees is a perfect balance of greens, onions, tomatoes and feta cheese. Steak Kabob, Chicken Kabob, Chicken Shawarma are all good consistent winners for me. The staff has always been friendly to me. Definitely one of my favorite places to go in the East Valley.

1. Too hot/humid.  They must either have a swamp cooler or they are just really cheap about running the A/C.  2. Equipment starting to get old.  They opened about 4 years ago and some of the cardio equip is showing its age. I've been noticing some repairs (new treadmill belts) lately, so I think mgmt is starting to care again.  3. Music too loud.  If I can hear the gym music WITH good noise canceling headphones on, it's too loud.  4. The place kind of smells. This could be related to #1.  If there was someplace better in our area, I'd go there instead. But there isn't... that's what we get for living out in the boonies.

I've been going here for a few years, so I figured it was time for a review.  I usually get rolled beef tacos with guac.  8 out of 10 times I go, the food is spot on, but the other 2 times, it seems a little "off". Like maybe the rolled tacos were deep fried too long or the meat was old or the oil needed changing.  That's my only criticism.   If they were more consistent, I'd give them 5 stars.  The salsa bar is really good and they even keep it stocked during breakfast hours.  Their breakfast deluxe burrito is enough to feed two people and if you slice up some of their grilled chiles on it, you'll be in heaven (with a hot mouth).  Another favorite is the Carne Asada Torta.  Not a lot of places can do homestyle Mexican food right, but Senor Taco has AWESOME Tortas.  The food is reasonably priced, the staff is always friendly and the dining area is always clean.

I've eaten quite a few meals at Thai Patio.  I've tried probably 2/3 of all the items on their menu and I usually try their weekly specials, too. Everything I've had there is excellent. This is the best Thai food in north east Mesa as of Sept 2011.

The only positive thing this place has going for it is the decor.    I had Green Curry Chicken, but it was unlike any I had had before ... and not in a good way.  What I remember clearly is that the vegetables were cut/sliced too big, not cooked long enough and the sauce was very, very bland.   The food implied a technical familiarity with the the ingredients of Thai food but a complete lack of the artistry of it.   Thai food is all about a balancing of flavors and mouth sensations... 5 R Cha failed at that... miserably.  I've had frozen Thai dinners that were better.
