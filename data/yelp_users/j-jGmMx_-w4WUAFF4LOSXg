First time going here and was scared about the reviews but read this first before you cast judgement based on other reviews.....  I took my car in for an oil change, interior detail, and an exterior wax. They did a great job! Like everyone else has stated they did try to upsale on (engine detail, tranmission flush, wheel alignment, chip windshield, cabin filter change and etc) just let them do their shpeel and just say no. I went in and before the guy could say anything I said this is what I want how much can you do it for, he replied and threw in some extra upselling offers and I said no. I got what I wanted at a fair price and great service, don't stay away from this place just because they upsell, just say a firm and respectful no and they leave you alone. The service was great, fast, and the facilities are awesome! They have a dunkin dounts inside :) two computers and two t.v.s with plenty of seating as well as a play area for kids...if you have older kids they have a playstation that should keep them distracted for awhile.  Overall I was very pleased and is now my official new car wash and oil change place.  (If you are a manager reading this....in my opinion to be five stars lay off the upsellin.  Customers will get what they need its fine to inform them what they need, but do not do it in a manner that they have to get it or their car will explode)

Went in today for an Oil Change,  I had an appointment originally scheduled for 8:30am but due to some last minute unexpected work issues I couldn't make it. I called them back around 11:30 and asked to make another appointment. Rick (the gentleman I worked with today) said I can bring it in and they would still be able to get it done today. I dropped it off and they had it finished and hour later. I truly appreciated their ability to be flexible and were still able to get me in and out relatively quickly.  I have seen other posts regarding customer service. Yes, someone who has nice smile and a warm personality are pleasant to work with but I am don't  to mechanics to make friends. I want someone who knows what they are doing and someone who I know will get the job done. I will definitely be back and I highly recommenced you check them out. Sometimes the "yes man" with the huge smile are the ones who take advantage and try to up-sell you on things you don't need. Id rather have someone who is rough around the edges but at least gives me a straight and to the point answer.  In regards to Ronnie Auto, Rick was both upfront and helpful when discussing my vehicle needs and will happily return for my next service.

Well to start off just because someone tries to sell you something or talk about getting into a certain program doesn't mean the gym is poor quality. DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT CONTRACTS YOU SIGNED! If they say sign here, here, here, initial there, and so-on take the time to read every line and negotiate the terms you want. Don't sign something and then complain about the contract afterwards, and in all reality that applies to everything, but hey what do I know....  Service I hate when I read negative reviews and the only complaint people have is "they pressure you" Really!? Don't get me wrong I agree if you are asked every single day multiple times a day it is bad service. But stop equating someone doing their job with annoyance. Yes, they will try talk about the different memberships and yes they will have you do a "free" fitness evaluation wherein, they will try to get you into a personal training program.   Let them do their job and if you are completely not interested just respectively and assertively say no, and they will leave you alone. But on the other hand what do you have to lose from a fitness evaluation. You can actually get a great understanding where you are physically and where you want to be, after that do your own thing if you want. Plus, if you do want personal training evaluate how much you spend at Starbucks, or eating and drinking out and i'm sure you can budget the funds to start an investment for your health.   One great customer service story I can share was from one of their employees named Talib. He walked through every program available and never pressured me to sign up for anything I didn't want to. He explained how he thought I can accomplish my fitness goals and left it at that. I did not sign up for training because I would personally feel more accomplished doing something on my own. But if you are looking for someone to kickstart your fitness goals no matter what they are whether to bulk up, slim down, increase flexibility, gain endurance, and etc, he is the go to guy. If you currently go to this gym or thinking of signing up get to know him because he goes the extra mile to help anyone out.   Equipment- I really like all of the equipment they have to offer. I have been to other locations and other gyms where machines are out of order for weeks or on the brink of breaking. I have yet to see a piece of equipment out of order for more than a few days. They also do a great job of keeping the equipment clean.   Atmosphere- I have read that people dislike the atmosphere, but if you want a quite, peaceful, and relaxing workout stay outside or go to a yoga studio. Yes this place has music that sometimes increases in volume and yes there are a lot of people but it's a gym! I rarely have to wait for pieces of equipment and there are plenty of cardio machines to go around.   One annoyance you may encounter are the "gym rats"  I don't mean to be offensive but hear me out. If you go to the gym twice a day that's great and there is nothing wrong with that if that is what you want to do. But a "gym rat" in the context I am referring to is a person who isn't actually working out that much and is standing around looking at themselves in the mirror as they scream when lifting.  It is not that often of an occurrence but it does happen (but then again it can happen anywhere). I don't think that is representation of the gym but just individuals being obnoxious.   All in all I enjoy coming here and they have programs and classes for all range of fitness goals. They always have promo's for 3 day passes or 5 day passes so swing by and check it out.

Let me start of by saying do no be afraid of the prices!! Yes it is a bit steep for "just a burger" (as some of my comrades like to say) but it is much more than that, it is an experience  At Indulge you are able to try a number of combinations that you would never of even thought of combining on your own. They provide the opportunity to try something that you probably never have had nor ever will have again.   With that being said, if paying nearly $15 for a burger is still hard to swallow for some of you there are always groupons and living social deals floating around....so fear not all you couponing maniacs :p  I wish I could give a play by play to what we had but for this review my number one tip is "GO FOR IT!" Whether you try something completely out of the ordinary or stick with the classics you will not be disappointed.  All in all the vast ability to customize a great tasting burger with an upbeat atmosphere made for a great night.

We were greeted at the door and the host was nice but as soon as we sat down the service just stopped. After literally 20 minutes we decided to leave due to no one acknowledging us without even the slightest smile. The food looked decent but we will never know, and due to the lack of service we will never return. If you are looking for a place to be treated as if you don't exist then Mellow Mushroom is the place for you.

Stop your search for a car wash because this is the place to go!  After having problems with Danny's Family Car wash and having heard horrifying stories of automated car wash machines damaging cars, I gave up hope in finding a fast great car wash in the Valley.   I found this place by chance one day and saw the advertisement for a $6 dollar car wash. I was skeptical but my car was looking horrible from the snow/rain fiasco we had a couple of weeks ago.  I drove up and the staff was extremely friendly and they explained how the entire process works.  I decided to go for the $8 wash and could not of  been happier. The overall experience is kind of cool, it is like if you took what they do at a Danny's or other full service place, and put it on an assembly line, and as you drive through they hand wash your car and then towel dry it in the end.   After you drive through they do one more towel wipe and also clean the rims and tires (which I think only comes with the $8 package). Off to the side they have about 10 self -service vacuum spots. After walking around my car, I was willing to bet money that you cannot see the difference between this place's $8 wash to Danny's $25 one.   Also, this past weekend I took it in to get the $16 full service in which they do the interior as well, and once again I was impressed and found it even better than a Danny's or Francis & Sons. They also have detailing and shampooing that I will try in the future and  given the amazing precedence so far I am sure that I won't regret it.   All in all whether you are looking for a quick cheap wash or a full detail this place is faster, cheaper, and in my opinion better than any other wash I have been to in the Valley.
