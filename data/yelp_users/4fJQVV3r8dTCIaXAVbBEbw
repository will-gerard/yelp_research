The Pitts Again in Glendale, AZ is an amazing barbecue joint that I had, once again, heard of on Diners, Drive-ins', and Dives! Yes, it's one of my favorite shows and I plan on trying one of Guy Fieri's recommended restaurants in every town I visit...if they have one in that town that is!  From the outside to the inside, the decor in this place is rockin' and there's always something interesting to look at, and while you wait for your food they have a little book on the table with trivia questions that you can enjoy with your friends and family while you wait!  The people who work there are very nice and are always making sure you're taken care of. The food is fabulous!! Here's the menu.....I had the Pork and Slaw sandwich (check out the picture...that's it!). I wasn't sure about it cause I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw normally. But since Guy Fieri and the waitress recommended it I thought, 'why not'! OMG! Delicious! The pork was moist and the coleslaw was a winner, and the two together with some Brbq sauce on top with an onion roll for my bread.....Holy moley!! It was awesome! It was heaven dancing around in my mouth!  So I give this BrBq joint a thumbs up and would highly recommend it to my family and friends if ever in Glendale, AZ!

One of my FAVORITE places to visit in Las Vegas!  Get away from the Strip for awhile and go and enjoy some cigars, wine, cheese, good entertainment, friendly bartenders and staff!  Never a dull moment here! They have a full bar now so not only can you enjoy a great glass of wine along with your cigar, but now your favorite cocktail as well!  They usually have some type of entertainment going on, but it is a small venue so it's nothing too fancy.  Usually just singing or karaoke.   They do have events once in awhile as well.  Sign up on their mailing list to have events sent to you via email.  Some are RSVP only. I always have a GREAT time here and recommend this place all the time to my family and friends when they are visiting Vegas!

One of the best Steak Houses with one of the best steaks that I've had in a long time!  The service was exceptional as well and the wine list goes on and on!   Our steaks were made to perfection and my mouth waters just writing this review!  Wow!  It was our 2nd wedding anniversary and we had mentioned to them that it was.  So without warning they brought us a lemon 3 layer cake that was to die for!  So sweet!  Exceptional!  Wait, I think I already mentioned that, but it deserved saying it twice! It's a must go to!  Put this restaurant on your bucket list for sure!

Every time I'm in Vegas and want a pizza this is the place I go!  The pizza is fantastic! The crust is outstanding, the sauce is oh so yummy, and the toppings are fresh.  I always get take away so I can't tell you how the restaurant is, but the service is always good when I pick up my pizza or call to order by phone.  Very nice and courteous staff.  I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.

In Caesars Palace there lies a little restaurant called Mesa Grill.  You've might of heard of the owner, a guy named Bobby Flay?   Ok, so this restaurant is not so small, in fact it's huge!  But not in size, in popularity and for good reason!  The service was fantastic, the design of the place is spectacular, and the food?  OMG!!!  The food is some of the best we have ever tasted in a very long time!  Everything that we ordered was perfect and yummy!  We started off with appetizers:  Yucatan Chicken Tacos Grilled Red Onion +Peanut-Smoked Chile Barbecue Sauce  Goat Cheese "Queso Fundido Rajas + Blue Corn Tortilla Strips   OMG!!  Amazing!!  I ordered:  Mango + Spice Crusted Tuna Steak Green Peppercorn-Green Chile Sauce + Toasted Pine nut Cous Cous   My husband ordered:  New Mexican Spiced Rubbed Pork Tenderloin Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter   The Tuna was cooked to perfection as was the Pork Tenderloin.  The sauces that went with these dishes were amazing and I can see why Bobby Flay is one of the best Chef's in the World!  My Tuna came with Couscous which had a taste that was indescribable and cooked to perfection, and My husbands Pork Tenderloin had a Sweet Potato Tamale that came with it that was so delicious it was like eating desert along with your main course!  We shared desert.  A Banana Creme Pie!  Yummy right?  Not as impressive as the rest of the dinner, but good at that.  Wasn't real sweet and seemed to be lacking something.  But all in all our time spent at the Mesa Grill was a Fantastic one, and we will go back again and again

I'm giving this place 2 stars because it just doesn't have it.   First off, the energy in this place is lacking.....the food isn't anything to write home about and seriously, I could of made better in my own kitchen.  The SPINACH CON QUESO DIP was ok, but the chips that came with it were stale and the CHICKEN AVOCADO SANDWICH was dry and came out like a burger not a sandwich......The Skinny Margarita's are horrible and lack tequila and the bartender doesn't know how to make a good martini to save his life! As for the staff?  Well our first waitress was a little too friendly and just about sat in my husbands lap....oh, I know that a little flirting comes with the job and is what you do to get a better tip, but come on honey, how did you know that I was not paying for that dinner?  If I was, the only tip you would of gotten would of been a 'back off a little on the whole, I have daddy issues in flirting'!  I have to admit though, once we changed seats after our dinner and went into the lounge area of the Bungalow, our waitress knew exactly what she was doing when it came to her job and her flirting was exceptional.....she knew how to work it while still being a classy lady, and I respect that!  As for the clientele of this place, it's a younger crowd full of loud drunk guys at the bar watching the football game.  What you expect in a sports bar.....Outside the crowds quieter and more tolerable. All in all, I won't be back and I won't be recommending this place to any of my family or friends!

I love this place!  Every time my husband and I come to Scottsdale we have to eat here!  They have some of the best sushi in Scottsdale and the service and atmosphere rocks as well! They also have a great happy hour where you get great deals on sushi rolls and drinks! I'm giving this place a thumbs up and will be back for sure!

Always a great choice for Italian, and surprisingly, for being on the strip, they have the best prices in town! I'm never disappointed when I come here.  The food is fantastic, the service is great, and the ambiance is grand, with views of the strip throughout most of the restaurant! I recommend this place with two thumbs up!

In the past years I've gone to this place a few times and it's been fantastic!  The servings were huge and the food fantastic! But since they've opened up more restraunts the quality of the food has really gone down and I'm sad to say that I won't be back to any of the Vegas restaurants. The past few times, in the past year and a half, at different Vegas locations it just wasn't as good.  Service isn't as good and the food is just blah..... San Diego's location, they say, is still fantastic.  It is the original!  Next time I'm in San Diego I guess I'll have to stop in and see if still is as fantastic as everyone says it still is! But as for Vegas locations......it's a NO for me.  I wouldn't reccomend them to anyone.

Driving by this place you probably wouldn't even think twice to stop in, but you would be a fool if you didn't.  Inside isn't anything to write home about, but that's no big deal once you're greeted by one of the nicest staff in Las Vegas. Traditional Thai food at it's best!  Big portions and every portion was begging to be eaten.  So good!  I would totally recommend to my friends and family.

What can I say about the FireSky Resort & Spa, except that it's a wonderful piece of Heaven set directly in the middle of the Arizona Desert!   From the moment you arrive the valets are there to greet you and treat you like your royalty and the staff is nothing but Wonderful! The grounds of the hotel are inviting and totally make you forget that you are in Arizona, and the rooms are pleasant with beds like marshmallow clouds! FireSky is a luxury resort and spa that plays on the four elements thought to represent all that exist: fire, water, earth and air. You will find three towers in front with fire and water representing the juxtaposition of the beautiful Sonoran desert setting and the expansive tropical grounds. The hotel lobby living room, has a stunning stone fireplace and beautiful cathedral ceilings.    They have 2 inviting pools and a jacuzzi with waterfalls coming out of large pillars with fire coming out of the top of the pillars! Hence the name FireSky.....One of the pools even has a small beach with sand. There are Cabanas and fire pits as well!    Another plus is that every night there is a happy hour with free wine tastings! You can't go wrong with that!    The restaurant, Taggia, serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner and may I say is very good! You can choose to sit inside or out on the patio. Service is fantastic!    Also, if you are a Kimpton InTouch Guest member, which is free, you will receive FREE Internet and there are a couple of cute leopard print robes waiting in your room for your comfort as well!    You can't go wrong with the Kimpton Hotels, especially FireSky! I've never had a bad time here and will always return when staying in Scottsdale.   PS....The Kimpton Hotels are ALWAYS pet and gay friendly!!

This place is hands down the BEST Szechuan Chinese in Vegas! Authentic as you can get and amazing tastes that dance in your mouth! Try the Kung Pau Chicken for sure! I'll be recommending this place to all of my friends and family.

Just a quick review about some take out Cheesecake from this place...... My husband and I went by this restaurant last night to try some of their cheesecake that we heard 'Is To Die For!' We walked in and were greeted by the friendly bartender who told us for take out just go to the back where the cash register was and they could help us with our order.   First off, the ambiance for this place is really nothing to write home about and is very boring.  So we weren't impressed with that aspect of it. Like I said before, the bartender was nice, but I can't say the same for the guy at the cash register! He was rude.  No greeting, no smile, and seemed bothered that we were only ordering the Cheesecake to go.  We even told him that we heard that the cheesecake was 'To Die For', and he didn't even blink.....he took our payment and said, 'It'll be up in a minute'...... I wanted to come back at another time and try and entree or more, but not now. Service is a HUGE part of a business, and the service here made this customer not want to ever come back to this place again. We also will not be recommending this place to any of our friends or family..... As for the cheesecake.....My husband liked it, but I've had better!

I've lived in Vegas for a year now, and just down the street is quite a few restaurants that I've been wanting to try.  Barcelona Tapas & Bar is one of them. Finally last night my husband and I decided to go and try it before our move to London next month. I was not impressed! The only thing good about this place was our server. A very tall and handsome guy with a lot of enthusiasm!  I believe he may of been the owner. When we walked in the ambiance of the place was just 'Meh' and it took a few moments before anyone even acknowledged that we were even there.  Our table was at one of the bar 'booths' which was uncomfortable and the table was so short that we couldn't even cross our legs.  We had to sit next to each other, not across from each other, because one side of the booth was a booth like seat and the other side of the table were these short little bar type stools with no backs.  Very uncomfortable! The food was OK, not wonderful, but just OK. Although I must say that the  Pan Fried Dates................................$ 5.50  (Pitted dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon with merlot reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese crumbles.) were VERY yummy!!  But everything else, I'm sorry to say, was just not very good. I've had better! The House Made Sangria was delicious though! I would recommend a pitcher of that any time. Half off pitchers and certain foods are at Happy Hour (Monday-Friday's from 4pm-7pm). So I'm sorry to say that I'm only giving this place a 2 star rating because I agree that it is just that;  Meh.  I've experienced better!

These BEAUTIFUL men and women deserve a 10 star rating, not a 5, hands down!! They have been sent from a GOD!! For the first time in my 41 years of life, I have found a guy named Marshall who I will now call my 'Hair Angel'!  From the moment you call they are professional! When you walk in you're greeted by everyone, not just the reception.  My experience when I walked in? I was first greeted by a very nice handsome young man who took my information and got me a yummy glass of water with cucumber, and then I was greeted by the owner himself, Kelly!  All I can say about Kelly is WOWIE!  He's beautiful! Not only on the outside, but on the inside! He took the time to actually talk to me and get to know me a little bit before I was greeted by my stylist. Next I was greeted by my 'Hair Angel' Marshall.  Marshall is not only handsome and so Euro Magnificent, but he is one of the nicest people I have ever met!  Marshall took me on a tour of the salon and introduced me to the other stylist. The salon has a few different areas; The area you get your hair styled, a color area, and one of the best parts is the 'Zen Room'.  In the Zen Room you get your hair washed and conditioned along with, get this, a head, neck and shoulder massage! Everyone who comes into the salon gets one! So Yummy! Marshall then sat me down at his chair for the day, and really did something I've never had any other stylist do.  Now I went into this salon asking for someone who could look at me and know what would look  good on me.  He asked me questions about my, my life, my job.  He wanted to pick a style that suited ME!  Very interesting..... Marshall then sat me down in the color area where he took the time to really look at my hair, my facial tones, etc. and pick out the best colors for me. We went with a few different reds and dark browns.....Beautiful colors! After the color I was taken into the Zen Room to have my color washed out, a conditioning treatment done, and my massage! The conditioning treatment I received also came with a bonus hand massage! I was in heaven! The girl who treated me to this wonderful experience was a beautiful girl and way sweet!  Marshall then cut my hair.  Or should I say Artistically Styled my hair! He was so precise and Perfection should be his middle name! When my hair was done I almost cried!  I was EXTREMELY HAPPY with my hair style for the first time in my life!!! I can honestly say that my entire experience at this salon ROCKED!! Every person that worked there was WONDERFUL and so Professional! You HAVE TO go! I'm sure that everyone there is a fantastic stylist! Thank you Marshall!!!  You're my hero!!

One of the best views of the Valley, especially at night.   The food it's pretty good, but it's not the best I've ever had.  I had the taco's. As for the margarita's, they are made with sweet and sour and are horrible and weak.  I prefer mine to be made from scratch and at least have some tequila in them.  The ambiance is nice, but it's really loud.   The service is good. Would I recommend this restaurant to friends and family?  No.  There are better Mexican restaurants out there, but if you want a nice view this is the place to come.

My husband and I really wanted some good old fashioned barbeque after living overseas for awhile, but this place just didn't do it for us.   Sure the ribs were OK, but just OK, and the beans and coleslaw were just that as well.....OK. The service was friendly and at least and the place was clean, oh, and don't forget the free popcorn while you wait.....but this still doesn't make up for a not so good rib/barbeque experience. We won't be back and won't be recommending this place to family or friends.

As good as it gets in Vegas for breakfast!  Breakfast joints in Vegas are hard to find let alone good ones especially of the strip, so when I found this place a little over a year ago I was pleasantly surprised!  (They only serve breakfast and lunch here, by the way) Simply put, EVERYTHING is GREAT here!   I recommend this place all the time! Two thumbs up!

My first Thai massage and I will never get another type of massage again!  They have me hooked! The ambiance was amazing and made me feel so relaxed, the masseuse and the girl at the front desk were wonderful, but the massage I got from the masseuse was AMAZING! I have never experienced a massage like this ever! If you want to feel like jello and relaxed as ever you have to go here.  Don't go anywhere else.  This will be my go to place when in Scottsdale.
