I went to the ER on Tuesday evening with severe pain. All the staff were polite, super efficient and were genuinely interested in helping me.  The ER is also quite clean.  I'm not a fan of the hospital any day. However, if I had to go again, I would choose this one.  Well, it's now Saturday and I'm still here. And I'm told I won't be going home for a while. ~ug~  However, I wanted to say thank you to all of the staff I have met. It's obvious to me they enjoy their jobs because they have all been amazing.

Tonight I had the prime rib.  Our server told me they only had medium left. Really? We got here at 5:30pm and they are out of medium rare?  My prime rib and broccoli arrived cold. They tasted okay but cold.   Then our server left us for more than 15 minutes after we were done eating. I asked for a to go box and the check. She was gone for another 10 minutes.  ~ug~

Sunday breakfast. They are always busy Sunday morning after church. They have good food and (usually) good service. Because they were so busy, we sat at the bar. The waitress that took our order and served us was quite rude. She had a bad attitude and was even offensive when asked a question.  I wish I knew her name, I would include it, but they don't wear name tags.   Everyone else was great!

I really like this theater. It's clean, comfortable and the staff are very nice.  It's also a great location, P83 area. You can see a relaxing movie then have a wonderful dinner at any one of the restaurants nearby.

I eat here quite often but tonight was just terrible.  My $30 porterhouse steak was so salty I couldn't eat it. My baked potato was also so salty I could barely eat it. Someone new at the grill...  On a positive note, the service was great!

Great pizza. Sometimes the places you wouldn't expect are great. This is one of them. I had their pepperoni and black olive pizza and enjoyed it. Great crust, thin and crisp. The toppings tasted fresh. I would recommend this place.

Breakfast was just okay.  Weird bowl of fruit though. Really small cut on the fruit and it had a weird taste.   Service was also slow today. It took 45 minutes to get eggs, toast and fruit?  They have good dinners here but I'm going back to MiMi's or Black Bear Diner for breakfast.

I've eaten here quite a few times and have never had a bad meal. They always bring out fresh tortillas and 3 dipping sauces. Today I'm having their bacon wrapped beef tenderloin and bacon wrapped, jalapeño stuffed shrimp. This shrimp is dynamite.  I do recommend getting a table instead of a booth. The booth tables are high and not much room.

I do like KFC every now and then. The food is always good at this one; when you finally get the right food. The employees don't seem to enjoy their jobs at all. And they always make you feel like they are doing me a favor.  All I ask for is to pay attention, get my order correct and smile!

First time here; tonight for dinner. The service leaves little to be desired.  Our server wasn't pleasant at all. He acted as though he was doing us a favor.  The food wasn't bad. I certainly wouldn't call it stellar but it was eatable.  I think we will continue to look!

Very good food here. I had the bone-in filet and it was cooked to perfection.  Hands down, this place has great food.  I also have to comment on the service.  I don't recall our servers name but he was outstanding. I'd like to thank the Broiler, the service and Boulder Station for a great evening!

I've been to and purchased many products from Al's Meat Market and believe them to be the best in the valley. The top quality, corn fed, Iowa meats are fantastic!  I have purchased bone-in prime rib roast, bone-in rib eye steaks, porterhouse steaks, beef short ribs and so much more from them and it has all been fantastic. Just this morning I made their breakfast sausage links; just amazing.   The service is also the best in the valley. If they don't carry what you need, just ask and they will have it for you in no time!  I highly recommend Al's Meat Market!

This was our first time here. All in all the food tasted fresh, delivered hot and delicious.  I had the Creole Shrimp & Grits.  The Creole Shrimp was good but I've had better. It was a little bland, could have used a bit more salt. The andouille grits were fantastic.   Skyler was our server tonight. She was wonderful. Very attentive to our needs, took very good care of us.  There are some very good looking items on the menu so we will be back to try them!

Super cool grocery store.  This was the first time I have been here and I really like it.  Very unique products you won't find in your everyday grocery store.  Great looking fish, seafood and meats. I will be back!

I consistently have great meals here.  I've always had good service, the staff is friendly and prompt. My go to meal is the walnut shrimp with melon. Yum...  I also really like their Changs fried rice.   Tonight we came for a birthday, there were four of us. We had the cashew chicken, walnut shrimp with melon, orange beef and Changs pork fried rice.  It was all very good.   Lastly, if you like hot tea, as I do; try the Dragon Eye Oolong tea, it's delicious...

If you've never had a bone-in filet, I recommend you give it a try.  Unless you infuse a filet with flavor, most often they don't have a lot of flavor. Unless you get it bone-in. The bone-in filet at Arrowhead Grill is to die for. Cut with your fork tender and full of flavor.  Perfectly seasoned, the executive chef at Arrowhead knows what he's doing. If you want to top it off with more deliciousness, get their green beans. They infuse the beans with bacon, garlic and butter. Absolutely delicious!  Now for the service. Our server was attentive, on the ball and there when we needed.  So... Do I have anything negative to say? Yes I do... Leave the salt and pepper off the table. It's not needed. The chef has seasoned everything perfectly!

So... I take my wife to O2 lounge for a drink. Some guy, we've never met, comes up to my wife and tells her he's taking her home. Looks at me and tells me the same thing.  I'm being nice, he said he would take my wife home and "f" her. I defend the situation, knock him out and sent him to the hospital. Now I'm 86 from the bar? At least I now know the O2 management are jerks and don't support women. I would never recommend going to this establishment, unless you want to be womanized and are okay with your loved one being disrespected. I will always protect my wife. Be disrespectful and I'll send you to the hospital...

I wasn't impressed at all. I had their Shrimp Pad Thai and it was okay. Nothing that would bring me back.  Guess I'm spoiled getting great Thai food in CA...

My first time at this Jiffy Lube. Getting an oil change and tire rotation.  They really aren't any more or less than Firestone or other comparable oil/tire service places. This place has quick service, I like that.  They got me in and out quickly!  I'll come back...

Absolutely great food. Of course it would be, I expected nothing less than perfect, and the food was.  What I did learn is Gordon is a master at marketing himself.  To be honest, I can cook a steak as good as I had this evening.  Buy a 30-day dry aged ribeye, fast sear with lots of thyme, toss it in the oven and "bam" great steak!  The service wasn't as good as I expected.  I'll bet, if Gordon saw the lack of service we had, he would have been screaming! I spent $500 on a dinner and expect to have the best experience ever... I went there to enjoy the Gordon Ramsey experience...  Great food, not so great service. Gordon, if you read these, kick your service in the ass!

This was my first time eating from the Emerson Fry Bread food truck.  My wife and I both had the smothered burrito and it was very good. Their sauce and ingredients tasted very fresh.  They were at the Central Farmers Market and will be there every Wednesday evening. Stop by and give them a try...

I have been here for a pedicure many times. I really enjoy it, it's relaxing and my old, tired feet feel great afterwards.  The owner and staff here are also great. They take really good care of their clients.  I'll continue to come back here!

First time here. Today I came for brunch.  Being seated outside was quick and comfortable. Our server was prompt with our food order but it about 30 minutes before we actually got our food. My eggs were cooked perfectly, the potatoes were great and the apple chicken sausage is delicious.   The two people I am with both had omelettes. The both said they were delicious. One had the veggie omelette and the other had a chorizo, feta, tomato and salsa.  They both looked great.  There was a lot of great looking breakfast and brunch items on the menu so I'll be back to test more out!

Unfortunately, I won't come back. Clam chowder didn't taste like clam chowder. Chicken fried steak tasted like the cook dropped the whole jar of fennel in the pot of gravy.

First time breakfast here and very pleased with the overall service, food and cleanliness of US Egg. We were greeted with a friendly smile and seated in less than 5 minutes. Our server arrived shortly after being seated, again with a warm smile, less than 5 minutes later.  I remind you, this is all during Mother's Day breakfast and this place was packed.  Shortly after receiving our drinks, our server took our order. Our food arrived hot, fresh and delicious. I had the eggs Benedict and would definitely order it again. If I had anything to say about improvement, it would be a couple drops of lemon juice in the hollandaise sauce for added freshness.  This is just a personal preference.  The food was delicious, service was great; we will definitely be coming back!

Today Jon came to my home and detailed our 2005 Prius.  I wish I would have taken "before" pictures so you could get an idea of the transformation our car went through in just 2 hours.  Being a 2005 Prius, it had quite a bit of road-rash, dings and the head/tail light lenses were terrible.  Jon, and co-worker, were able to buff out most of the blemishes/dings and the head/tail light lenses look almost brand new!  In addition to detailing the exterior, they completely (and thoroughly) detailed the inside and under the hood.  They removed all of the carpet pads, washed/scrubbed them clean.  Jon and his co-worker were very professional, clean and described what they were going to do before they got started; no surprises (except how nice it looked when they were done).  I knew exactly what it was going to cost before they started and neither of them tried to sales-pitch me, at all, to bump the price.  I really like that; they did what they said they would do and I am a very pleased customer.  The did a very professional job and I already have them scheduled to do my pickup next week.  I would highly recommend giving Jon a call...

I had Jon come back and detail my Chevy Silverado this last week and it also turned out great.  We have certainly found a quality auto detail expert and will continue to use his services in the future.  Thank you again Jon!

I have been here a few times since I moved here and I like their food and service.  Today I started with the Gyoza Dumplings and they were delicious.  I could make a complete meal of these alone.  For dinner I had the Steak Katsu Box with a side Lobster Tail. They don't have the Lobster tail on the menu as a side; but they will do it for you if you ask!
