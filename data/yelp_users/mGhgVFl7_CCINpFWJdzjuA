Great wing specials on Tuesday and Thursday and their bottle beer specials make it for a cheap and very good night. We usually go to the Tempe location on Broadway but it is crammed with college students during the year. This location is much easier to find a table and the service is better as well.

My girlfriend and her mother used to go to this place so I decided to "cheat" on my shop and go here as well. BIG MISTAKE! My car was overheating and $450.00+ later, my car still had the same problems. They told me it was going to cost another $400+ to fix and I told them where to shove it. i am knowledgeable enough mechanically to understand cars... and especially enough to know someone is trying to rip me off. I took the car home and flushed the system myself. Problem solved. About a month later, my car started overheating again. I am sure if I tried to take it in to them they would have tried to pull $400 out of me. I went to my normal shop (Chapman's auto in north Phoenix at 40th St & Greenway... WORTH THE DRIVE! They are honest and don't charge you to guess at the problem). They showed me that one of the items that Dana placed on in their attempt to fix my overheating problem was not tightened and placed on right. Now my car works correctly and I will NEVER go back to Dana Auto. BIG RIP OFF!

Great food, great prices and great service. You can choose to sit at a normal table or on the floor (nearly) style. Lots of vegetarian choices as well. :)

The welcome we received walking in was colder than darth vader in outer space. As we walked to the table the hostess was not happy to seat us. We did not feel welcome and left to the Blue Nile on Rural and University. Blue Nile is great.... highly recommend over this place.

Completely over priced for what this is. Food is extremely hot to cover the lack of any type of flavor. Pitcher of beer prices are decent. Go somewhere else... this place is lacking in taste, service and quality..

Yasu sets your expectation and standards level for sushi all over the world.  I travel far and wide and love eating sushi everywhere to see what new ideas and ratings I can find.  I have told Yasu that I am trying to find a place better in the world and still have yet to do this.  Yasu sushi is more than a 5 star.  ** you must allow the sushi chefs to create a few items for you. Do not expect Ra Sushi prices.... it will be a little more but you do not want to eat at Ra sushi. That is a dare.  You want to taste heaven? Eat at Yasu.

This is my most favorite Irish Bar in all of Phoenix! The food and the staff are fantastic and the patio is great. The Chymist is my spot to watch all the football (soccer) matches as well. :)

I saw there was a groupon recently for this place and it reminded me that I had not reviewed this place on Yelp so I am here doing it. We went her for my girlfriend's birthday and the servers pushed us into ordering a premium Omakase menu where the chef picks different items based on your tastes. Everything tasted good and compliments to the chef but our bill with a couple drinks came out to $600!!!!  We were hungry less than an hour later as the portions were less than appetizer sizes. I wish we ordered a steak and sushi and called it a night. Instead, I feel like we got the Roka Akor hustle. If I was to have sushi, I highly recommend Yasu by PV mall. AMAZING... it is pricey but you will not reach anywhere near $600. The service was not $600 worth of service and there is no way I would ever want to eat or spend that much in one night on two people. Roka Akor got all its money it will ever be seeing from me.

Up until today, I regularly order food here. Today will be my last time stepping foot in this place.   Everything I wanted on the menu was not available and after a few more tries, I settled on a gyro (which is definitely not what I came in for). . The cook was very rude when I politely asked if he would be kind enough to throw in one of the tiny tahini sauces. This is the very least they could have done for not planning their ordering of food.  He became a complete jerk, all because i asked for an extra sauce (they never fill the ones you get anyways).  Attitudes like his have no place in the service industry. The energy of someone cooking food is  transfered  into the food and no one wants to eat douchbag!  I wondered why they have a sign asking for someone to invest in their business in the front (which is completely tacky by the way) and now I know why they need it. Bad attitudes lose business. Good luck. You will not be missed as there are plenty of great med. places in the area.

I usually like Wildflower, but last night, we walked in without realizing it was 2, yes TWO minutes after 9... (I could have sworn they stayed open until 9:30pm), Instead of the staff saying anything they just gave us dirty looks and the energy was very negative. I had to ask if we did something wrong and in that question I had to ask "oh, are you closed" and still had a passive answer. We ended up walking out. Sorry for being 2 minutes late! Maybe you should lock your doors or speak up next time. UPDATE:  The management contacted me immediately after and apologized and was very responsive to our problem. Great communication and sincerity! :)

Went for my first time today.  People have recommended this place and I do not see what there is to like. I had the huevos rancheros and the beans were soupy and the only thing that had flavor was the corn tortilla. The potatoes they talk about sound good on the menu but are also flavorless and soggy being partially cooked.  Less than half way through my food, I took a bite and CHOMP!, there was a large piece of a ceramic glass dish hidden between the eggs and flavorless beans. I stopped to make sure my teeth were not broken as I crunched the piece into 3 other pieces.   Asked for the manager and he came out. Very emotionless, he says he will comp the dish. You bet you are!  There was no apology, it was an "I will take it off your check" and walked away.   On our way out, I walked past him again and he didn't say a thing and I do not think he cared anyways.   Customer service is VERY IMPORTANT.  Without it, you get 1 STAR yelp reviews and breakfast eaters who will not return.

Beautiful view, terrible food. Go for drinks and avoid the food at all costs. I have eaten here several times and every time it gets worse!  This time, I ordered pizza and I took a bite and it was frozen! If I wanted red barons pizza, I would have stayed home. Asked for pepperonis, charged .50c and there was one pepperoni on it. Waste! These owners and food staff should retire.

Finally! An excellent Korean Market with a cafe in back. I love their kimchi selections and the cafe. This is well needed in the Phoenix metro area and I am happy it is close here in Tempe. A great addition to the city!!

Caribbean spice is great. If you like truly authentic jerk chicken dishes, this is for you! I highly recommend their Roti dishes!!

This place is a great find! The lunch prices are very reasonable and such great quantity and quality (I am very picky with food and quality). They could use a better lettuce than iceberg but that is my only request to change. Apparently, they opened in 2010 and I have been missing out.... missing out no longer. Great food and nice owners and staff. Scandinavian food is on!

This is a drinks only place. The food is extremely low quality and it is not good. Chicken tacos were two tiny tiny tiny pieces of dark meat with a big wad of shredded lettuce and a few bits of tomatoes on top. No sauce, no flavor, nothing. The shrimp skewers were $7 for 3 skewers and from the way it sounds there may be a few shrimp on each one. Nope, just one small shrimp on each. Not quality food, not quality chefs.

Burger was ok. This place is disgustingly dirty. If a health inspector came in today, that place would have been shut down. Fries were good, but will not return to this chain again.

Barrio Cafe in Phoenix and Barrio Queen have the best stylized  Mexican food in the state. They use healthy ingredients and they make their dishes with a fusion twist. I highly recommend their guacamole. I typically can't stand guac and I love it here. At Barrio Queen, they also have a sushi style street taco menu. It is fantastic and I find myself ordering on here more often than not. Highly recommend!

I highly recommend!  I have gone to a few places using a groupon for similar benefits and they have been questionable at best. Not at Mind, Body & Flow... the place is spotless and comfortable with a great environment and a fantastic staff. I will definitely return here :)

Food and server were good. I always find it hard to swallow a place that charges $10-11 for a burrito. I live close and I was hoping for a new drinking spot to walk to that may take the place of the loved Chuy's. Nope! They are serving Coronas for $4.50 each. A 6 pack is $2 at the store.Why bother. They need to reduce their beer prices and get better happy hour and reverse happy hour specials if they want business. Will not go back until I hear of better prices and specials. Chuy's was cheap and good... learn from the success of the company that was there.

I really dislike giving bad reviews but this place deserves it. I like the inside space and the bar expands along the wall and the artist bookings are great but there are major disappointments every single time I have been here.  I was there last night (10-30-13) for a show. Our group arrived early and the buzzkill started immediately when you walked in the place and there were 2 metal rails placed through the center of the place from the back right up to the front. This divide was to host an under 21 crowd on one side and the oldies but goodies on the other. Now, I understand there are laws and regulations that try to keep people apart in fear a sip of a tasty beverage may be had but come on people! How about a little more inventiveness to reduce the front part of the 21+ area (part of the bar they weren't using anyways) and move the rails to the left... thus creating a dance floor area where everyone can dance, party, have fun together.  Simple thoughts take only a moment and make so much difference.  The other, as it seems so many other comments have talked about is the sound. There is a great sound system in there with a below par sound engineer who EQs the place so that you leave with your ears ringing (and I am still hearing ringing the day after). This entirely has to do with good sound engineers.   Also, what is with the vents above rattling from the bass. Stuff some napkins up there for God sake! And if that doesn't work, maybe its time to think about placing a floating ceiling in between the ducts (i know its trying to look cool that way) to mute the rattling?   The last thing and so important... what is with the security guards posted up on stage at each of the speakers observing the crowd?? Arms crossed really trying to spot those no good people out in the crowd. Are you serious? Every  city around the world that I have traveled to has fun people from the crowds dancing up at the speakers and here in good ole Phoenix it feels like an extension of tent city with security there. Security should be strategically placed so they have their power control trip without dominating the scene.  Something really should be done as this is a good space and there is no reason for the lack of innovation and to over security control. Its not good representation for artists to see and leave with stories such as this either...

Blue Nile's Ethiopian menu is still served plus an addition of another menu. Great food! Average hummus though... I would pass on that, but everything else is great.

Finally a great Korean fix!  Spicy kimchi always hits the spot :) I ordered the chicken bulgogi and it was accompanied by small veggie side dishes.  The portions are good sized, the food is very flavorful and the service was welcoming and very nice. I am sure to be a regular here.  :)

While the food was good, the portions are extremely small. And when I say small, they are small. For instance, the beet salad was not a salad but a tablespoon of quinoa with one small beet sliced into four spread into an arrangement on a long thin plate. Cost: $13... it should have been around $4 for this. The beer glasses were small is well. This was good for a try but I will not go back. I give the owner less than a year for business. The current model will not attract long term or repeat business.

LA Casa De Juana is fantastic! Finally a place close by that actually serves authentic and fresh Mexican dishes in a fun environment.  This is our new go-to mexican in Tempe!! And now that I know they deliver on the weekends, they will get even more business. :)

It disappoints me to give Flo's a 1 star as the food at their Scottsdale location has been decent but I will not return to this one again. After ordering, we were sitting for an over extended period of time for our food. (Ordered carry out). After a while someone brought out a carry out order to the desk but the attendants were not there. Finally the girl walked back to us and said she was going to check on our order. the next thing I see is that she is coming out the other door and walks toward one of her friends working and strikes up a casual conversation completely forgetting about us waiting. I decide to get up to look at the order they brought out and it was ours! Talk about bad service.  So... we get home to eat (ordered the Lemongrass chicken. The dish was completely without flavor and was only a bunch of noodles and some small pieces of chicken. Everything else was left out including the flavor. Charging as much as they do for measly dishes is just plain out ripping people off.  I would never recommend anyone eating here. There is Yupha's Thai and many other delicious places around with much better service staff and quality of food.

The Aurit Center helps make a very difficult situation, bearable. In every way, they try to make the divorce mediation process comfortable for those involved. I don't understand why anyone would go to court when they can just use mediation. Especially, loved the snacks in the office. Michael is an excellent mediator. And Karen is always a pleasure to deal with as well. Unfortunately, lack of proper communication diminishes relationships through time and I occasionally have real estate clients who call and ask for a divorce attorney. I immediately send to the Aurit Center before things get out of hand and the return response thanking me for doing so is tremendous!!  Highly recommend!!

Rachel is my favorite of all the colorists and stylists I have been to in Phoenix/Scottsdale and I always leave feeling clean and sexy. The new salon is great! The space really focuses the attention on you during your time there. Great energy and friendly. I highly recommend Rachel! :)

Everything I have been wanting in a proper ramen house! I have eaten at the majority of others in the phoenix metro and the were average at best. This is Tokyo in your face and top notch from the noodles to the added items. The appetizers were excellent and I highly encourage to step out of your comfort zone and explore.  Definitely returning soon.
