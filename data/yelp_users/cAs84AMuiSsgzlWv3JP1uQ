I like this airport overall. Its huge and has tons of amenities for passengers. They have their own restaurant row which is really great for passengers looking for something to eat while on a long layover.   Only negative is the security. I fly in and out of this airport at least once a month and getting through security has always been an issue.  Airlines vary in suggested arrival times prior to departure but i have learned that time to get through security isnt included in that. Sometimes it takes 10 minutes to get through security but the last few times we arrived 90 min (to check our bags) prior but almost missed our flight. This last flight it took an hour and 6 min (yes i kept checking my watch) to get through security, my 10 year old son and i had to sprint to our gate and barely made it before they closed the doors. We heard our names over the intercom from the security. I had asked security if there was any way to get thru security faster and the response i got was "i cant do anyting for you its not my problem, sorry" (verbatim). First off, super rude and second, this is who im suppose to trust to keep us safe?!??? I understand and appreciate the extra attention to ensure my safety and the safety of others, but when a line forms that is over an hour why is only one TSA agent working to check boarding passes and ids? And why are only 2 security screenings open? Especically when i counted 15 TSA employees present.

I've only experienced the Buca experience one time years ago, so when it was mentioned as an option I was more than open. We decided to get it to go since we had tons of kids with us.   I just want to start by saying this place lacks the understanding of customer service and I feel it's been forgotten that these employees wouldn't be employed if it were not for paying customers, but just an opinion.   We walked in and passed 3 employees, one was even a host! Not ONE word in acknowledgement was spoken to us in the first 4 minutes. Worse, we walked up to the "to go" window and someone was actually standing there, she looks up and walks away.  FINALLY, Jacqueline says hello and begins to help us. We tell her our name, our order and that we have a coupon. She looks at it and first tells us that the coupon can't be used at that location. We show her on the coupon where it says that location SPECIFICALLY. She then says something along the lines that her manager told her earlier that they can't use them. I ask why, she says she doesn't know just that her manager said they can't. I then ask to speak to her manager, she comes back and says he's busy right now but he said the coupon can only be used on Easter Sunday. I then show her on the coupon that it says EASTER WEEKEND specifically on the coupon. She then begins to stutter (mind you she's already given me multiple reasons why it can't be used). She then goes on to say how again her manager says it cant be used and how SHE has no control over it. I then ask ok "so its just bad marketing then right, since it says easter weekend, only on to go orders and your location" (all requirements we met). She was definitely struggling for words at this point. Then I asked "and your manager is too busy right now to talk to a customer? Its ok, I just want to make sure we are on the same page, that's all?" She slyly shakes her head in aggreance and then I ask for her managers card.  She left to get one is what I assumed but within 15 seconds she returns with her manager, Dereck (I believe he mumbled his name was).   He then apologized and explained how there are so many coupons out there "people are using" that he can't keep them all straight. Just some advice, as a manager never admit you have no clue what is being used as marketing for your place of business. It makes you look unorganized as a business, with management that isn't fully informed.   Long and short, 20 min later and an irritated customer later we were able to use the coupon. Thing is it wasn't even about the coupon honestly we could have cared less about it since it was only a few bucks but the lack of concern, service and hospitality that we received from the get go was what topped off what I will classify as a horrible Buca experience. Doubt I'll go back and I wouldn't recommend it either.

This is my VERY first review where even the one star i gave is NOT deserved. I honeatly dont see how this place stays in business especially with Sura open right across the street.  Not only will we never be back, we didnt even stay for dinner, even after being seated. Yes, our large party up and left after we saw the menu and realized how expensive it was for such a small variety of food. They offer 3 menus. The $16 has about 8 items, the $20 about 12 items and the $25 has about 15 items. Problem #1 your entire party/table has to get the same menu. Problem #2 (more of a personal once because it is my fav) they dont have Kalbi on any of the menus. Problem #3 they charge full price for anyone over 7, now i want to meet a 7 year old who can eat just as much as a full grown adult.   We left and went to Sura where the selection is about 4 times that of Korean Garden, they charge half price for kids under 12 and yup they have Kalbi. The service there is great as well.   Truly a disappointment

So after allowing myself some time to cool down and contemplate the situation encountered with this store I am able to put my thoughts to words, enough for a review.   Let me start by saying this boutique is quite beautiful, inviting and full of amazing dresses. Having dealt with them on two very separate occasions (wedding dress & prom dress) and having had less than spectacular service, I find it to be more of a trend versus just a one off situation. I as an outsider would assume such a boutique would understand the importance and sensitivity required when purchasing such an item which I might add is NOT amongst the less expensive of purchases.   Focusing more on the most recent interactions, I had gone with my cousin to purchase a prom dress and on the first visit we were quite satisfied with the service, dress and quote from the seamstress for alterations. After some consideration we returned to purchase this gown for her prom. We had expressed our concern with the alterations since she wasn't from this state and would have to travel back to try it on again and pick it up. After recieving a much higher quote from another seamstress we still moved forward with the alterations, even though we were quotes much differently to begin with. After setting a date/time to come back (keep in mind she had to travel back to Nevada) AND confirming the appointment 3 days prior, we arrive and the dress is not only NOT ready, they inform us the seamstress JUST started the alterations. After having the dress for 2 weeks they start the alterations at the appointment time.   This clearly was a huge problem. Which was followed by a resolution of a refund! Now the clarity was not made on what the refund was referring to but my cousin promptly said "for the dress, um no I want the dress"... And then it was followed with an offer for her to ship it then after the alterations were completed. So i think it's fair she was offering a refund of the dress...totally not sure how that would fix anything and end with any resolution other than more frustration, money and time spent and wasted and in the end NO DRESS. So .. To sum this up we went back and forth and was totally annoyed with complete irritation. In the end we finally got the dress and walked out.   I hate to say it but after 2 unpleasant encounters with this company, it's not a coincidence.

If I could give them zero stars I would. The service is absolutely horrid. I don't even think that word truly defines the service. A lady straight up came to our table asked us "what do you want".. We told them and she shoke her head and walked away. We had to ask for food multiple times and only once were we actually listened to.  Fair disclosure we actually frequent this place a lot for dim sum but this one visit was absolutely the worst. I am sure we would go somewhere else of there was any other place that served dim sum in the phoenix area but choices are very slim.

Now this was definitely a new experience. A restaurant within a small, neighborhood type grocery store. When I way within I mean within. The tables are set up within the pockets of areas that they fit, next to the shelves of food, by the door, next to the kitchen , etc its really homey and a neat idea.   You go up to the deli counter and order. The deli counter has a huge variety of salads and sides within out for customers to see, which all look amazing by the way.   I tried the meatball sandwhich, tomato and mozzarella salad and Greek salad. All amazing!! The bread used for the meatball sandwich was crispy but soft on the inside. Meatballs were a generous size and full of flavor. Loved the tomato and mozzarella salad with basil and a balsamic vinegarette dressing.  Craving that again!!  Super cute spot, check it out if your in the mood for Italian yummy!

So I want to write this review before I forget all the horrendous details about the service we received. This was my first time here, I was meeting a few of my friends who attend ASU for dinner. Now being from a world that custimer service is pretty much everything I have to be honest and say that from the gate the service was lacking in every aspect. Let's start with the snotty, young hostess who THOUGHT she was being sly (by talking under her breathe and not looking directly at us but rather above our heads), about talking about our group and how (because one extra person showed up) "messed up everything" (her exact words). She continud to talk negatively about us and more so insult us by thinking we were deaf, maybe, because in her head I believe she didn't think we could hear her even though we were literally 4 feet from her. SMH! About 15 minutes later we were seated. Approximately 5 minutes later we were finally greeted and our drink order was taken, drinks dropped off....then almost 10 minutes later our server comes back and finally takes our order only to inform us that it's going to be about 25 minutes for our meal to come out. Now I guess it could take 25 minutes to make 4 pasta dishes, cheese bread and a sausage but that kinda seems long. Nonetheless, our food comes out but one entree short. The server then says it got messed up in the kitchen and it was going to be another 8 minutes. She then comes back and apologizes and says the manager is working on the dish and it will be out soon, about 10 min later the entree finally comes out....I'm going to cut this short as I sure you already get the picture. The experience of our dinner here simply for lack of better words, sucked.  Only reason I gave them two stars was because however horrible the service was the food itself was pretty good. Portions were large and can definitely be shared. Pretty sure I won't be coming back to this restaurant again, or maybe we will just visit another location with hostesses that don't start out the dining experience so negatively.

Let me start by saying subconsciously  have high expectations for this restaurant. I have been here for dinner quite a few times so I was curious to see what breakfast was like.   We were greeted by what I can only say was an absent minded hostess. I was a tad set back by her somewhat rude "hello", lack of eye contact, smile and simple customer service. Being the first person to set an impression on customers in such a fine restaurant you would think she would have better greeting skills. We were then taken to our table by another host who not only didn't say one word to us while we were walking to the patio dining but walked so fast we actually lost him going through the restaurant. Only positive experience about the whole entry and seating was our table was in a great spot on the patio with a great view.   We were then greeted by our server who I would say switched up my negative outlook thus far. She was friendly, personable and attentive. We enjoyed the salmon and Florentine Benedict. Both were very good, the eggs were poached just right topped with a rich Hollandaise sauce.  We then enjoyed a banana foster crepe for dessert.   The dining experience I would give a 4, the food a 4 and the hostess team a -1  Be careful too if your wearing black because the napkins leave lint all over your clothes. I was wearing a black dress and I was covered in white lint.

This review is just about the event center, not the hotel itself.  Love this venue!   Seen a few concerts here and had a blast each and everytime. The venue is easy to find and away from the casino so it's not super crowded when trying to locate it and get in. I think its a good size venue as well. Even the level 200 seats are not too far from the stage and still has a good view in my opinion.

Pretty cool Mexican food spot in the Hard Rock. Atmosphere is inviting, fun and enjoyable. Enjoyed lunch with co-workers and was quite happy...And full!   Queso, guac, chips and salsa to start. Watch out! Its so good it will be hard to stop. Guacamole is fresh topped with diced tomatoes. Queso served hot and addicting!   I had the chicken and shrimp fajitas. Tortillas were hot and fresh and  steaming chicken and shrimp with softened onions and peppers.

Love Japanese food? This IS the spot!   It is a more upscale, fine dining type of restaurant so the prices are a tad on the higher side but worth it. It's filled with a mix of clientele. Some dressed up, some ready to go to the club and a couple more casual. The atmosphere is inviting and the decor is pretty traditional.  This hands down my favorite spot for Japanese cuisine. Everytime I visit this restaurant I leave full, happy and 1000% satisified.   Tonight we enjoyed dinner herend experienced our first teppan dinner here. My son had so much fun which is already something to be said. He didn't touch his iPad once, and for those who have kids know that's a big deal nowadays, especially when you are trying to enjoy a nice, upscale dinner. Our chef Loy & David were entertaining, fun and kept us smiling with laughter.   Our server Aries & Ed were attentive and very friendly. They met our needs and made the visit extremely pleasant.   We enjoyed a variety of wonderful food tonight: *Australian Kobe Beef - a very generous portion cooked so well it melts in your mouth, served with fried garlic slices *Lobster, shrimp & Crab - cooked in butter and other spices (not sure what they were) *Fried rice *Shishito peppers *Jalapeño Ponzu Yellowtail *spicy scallop hand roll *Salmon Sashimi (with toppings again not sure what exactly they were) *Salad with candied orange and lemon ponzu dressing *crab miso *Chocolate coconut mochi  *Bananna cream puff with caramel and chocolate sauce (not sure of exact name)  All of it was amazing. I can't wait to go back!

This visit was one of those bittersweet ends. An end to what has always been a memorable experience. I remember discovering this place almost 9 years ago and since that discovery it honestly has been one of my favorite restaurants. The news of its closing saddended me a bit but I understand going out while still on top. They had a good run and I look forward to the new morimoto.   Dinner here the other night was like always exceptional. Service of course like every other visit was top notch. Ed, our server was pleasant, suggestive, friendly and even a little funny here and there. Service is a big deal in this industry and Ed has perfected that skill with his own added pizazz. I really hope I continue to see him even when Morimotos starts to create their legacy here in Vegas.  Hamachi jalapeño and kapachi sashimi never fails to satisfy. The shishito peppers were a bit different this time, it came with an added sauce drizzled on top. I always loved the shishito peppers how it came before but change isn't always bad. Best oyster tasting...still my favorite is the yuzu truffle. Cod was amazing softest fish I've ever had with so much flavor. Scallops cooked in uni butter still makes my mouth water.   All in all, it was nothing short of a perfect dinner. I will miss you Shibuya!!!

As a person who is always on the lookout for new crepe spots, this one was a true disappointment. I actually yelped a crepe restaurant while we were on the strip and we purposely went to Paris only to go to La Creperie. You would think a crepe shop inside Paris hotel would be really pressured to perform up to a certain standard. All I can say was it was DEFINITELY not worth the price.   The crepes itself didn't stand out. Mine looked like it was literally thrown together. The whipped cream was sliding off the crepe and pretty much off the crepe and on the side by the time we sat down. The nutella was plopped on the crepe like as a splatter. The presentation was simply just ugly.   As for the service, I was appalled by how rude the lady was. I had asked if they had a crepe with strawberries and bananas, she said they could do the fresh berries with bananas. She then proceeded to tell me they charge for extra banana, which I was ok with. After getting my order however there were no banana. I asked her and she replied with "oh you didn't order banana, you asked for nutella." I replied with an assuredness that I DID ask for banana and she continued to be rude saying I didn't. I couldn't believe it. So I walked away an unsatisfied customer.   Overall, never going back there.

I saw this show a few years ago and thought it was great. I had the pleasure of seeing the new revamped show and again....great! The musical talent and creative atmosphere displayed during the show definitely keeps your attention.   They get the audience involved and everyone on their toes.   Looking for a show to watch in vegas...this is a definite must. I see why they have been in Vegas now for so long!!!

Had seen some pictures of the food that a friend had posted and definitely felt my appetite growing. Had never heard about this spot that lies within a local casino but was intrigued. Nestled inside the Gold Coast Casino, this restaurant seemed extremely popular, after about an hour wait we were finally seated.   The carts came around fairly quickly, so we were able to eat right away. The food itself was pretty standard and comparable to any other dim sum restaurant. However, my favorite item bolo bao was definitely not the same and I was unfortunately dissapointed. It was only bread with no custard filling and the custard baked on top was extremely hard.   Service was prompt and though there was a bit of a communication barrier, they were polite and willing to help figure out what we needed/wanted.   Price was decent and actually considering all the food we got it wasn't as expensive as I was expecting. Overall, I wouldnt be against going back.

Our visit started out no smooth, but ended on a better note. I've only been here one time and it was years ago. My brother was visiting and wanted to check it out. A friend of his told him about it and how big the portions were.  The initial service when we went to put our name with the hostess was barely worth 2 stars. They were pretty busy so granted the girl may have been stressed but nonetheless she was rude, short & frankly put a sour taste in my mouth. Not a very good first impression. We were told it would be 45 min because we were a larger party bit we only ended up waiting around 25 so we were quite pleased.   Our server introduced himself to us fairly quickly and took our drink order.  As for the service overall, he did a good job in flipping our annoyance into a good time. He was attentive, informative and friendly.   Our food came out quickly as well. All I can say is once we saw the food, we understood the meaning of "huge" portions. The food looked like artistic work, we didn't even know where to start on some dishes.   The Benedics are overly large, but we found that it was all really just a bunch of carbs layering the whole bottom. Most of the good stuff was on the top And the sauce didn't even go to the bottom so needless to say we didn't really eat it.   Waffles were delicious! I want to try the bacon waffle next time.  Hungry? Check it out

First time visiting this place with my family. It is like a small carnival but indoors. They even provide you with food, all you can eat. Don't expect gourmet but pizzas, cookies, salad and ice cream kept the kids quite happy.  Games, cosmic bowling type lanes, rides and prizes! I even likes the place as an adult! Ha ha.   A definite cool spot for the entire family on the hot Arizona summer days.

Great place and healthy (depending on what you order). Shabu shabu style is not only fun but a different way of eating. Entertained some visitors at this spot and they had never done it before, so I welcomed them to a new world.   I ordered the mushroom party and I LOVED it. So good and felt healthy, fresh. Also enjoyed some prime rib and was a bit reluctant thinking it would be bland but surprisingly it wasn't.   Recommend this spot if you looking for a new way to dine!

Love everything about this place. The food is delicious, the ambiance is fun and welcoming and the staff is committed to top notch customer service.   Definite recommendations Apps: truffle chips, chili glazed wings, shrimp polenta pizza: mushroom pizza (a friend egg & sliced sheets of parmesan served on top), prosciutto Entrees: Ribeye with Brussels sprouts and potato's (Brussels some of the best I've ever had)  Desserts: Beignets are the best! Filled with nutella and a served with a banana cream dipping sauce.  Service is a pretty big influence on the experience overall and our server and bussed solidified the 5 stars. Robert, our server, was very personable and funny. He had some great suggestions as well.   Josh, our busser, was extremely polite, quick to clear any empty plates and/or ask if we would like refills.  I noticed two things he did that I have NEVER experienced before. The first was he a sked for permission to clear the plate, he didn't only ask if we were done he asked if it was ok if he clear it. The second was when he was setting up for our desserts to arrive. He set the women first, then the children and then last the men. Old school manners that get noticed and go along way!!

Great park!! It has everything from a pool to soccer fields, baseball fields and a huge playground with lots of picnic areas. The park has tons of space and always seems busy. Families everywhere and there is always something going on.

Everytime I visit this location I'm reminded why it is that I am willing to drive another few blocks west to the location on Durango. All the employees, except maybe 2,  act like they hate life/their job and its portrayed in their service. My last visit when I went to check out the cashier just stared at me while I put my items on the counter. He didn't say one word to me during the whole transaction. Then when I was leaving I said TO HIM, " thanks have a good day".. His response a blank stare and NOTHING back. After so many encounters of this magnitude...I felt it was time for a review. Customer service is essential in ever part of life, if not customer service simply being able to have polite human interaction.

Took my aunt and uncle here, every time they are in town they wish to visit this restaurant. We are never disappointed. Always wonderful to have some good Filipino food, makes me miss my own moms cooking.   Only negative, they didn't have adobo. Adobo is a traditional Filipino meal so was a little shocked they didn't have it. On the flip side they did have fried pusit, which I never see at any Filipino restaurant so that was a great surprise.

Great place! Recently had our truck repaired there and from the start John was amazing! Super friendly, constantly kept us in the loop with what was going on and really worked with us on the prices, since we were paying out of pocket. The truck looks great and we are extremely happy with the results. Best part John was able to actually even save us money.  Amazing and definitely a spot to use!

I am an avid Starbucks drinker. I am not sure if it's good or bad but I visit a Starbucks at least 4 times a week, some days twice. I had an early meeting by this location the other day saw the Starbucks and was overjoyed because I needed coffee bad!!!  Kinda wished I would have driven closer to my office and just went to my "regular" Starbucks because I experienced my first negative experience EVER at a Starbucks. I went through the drive thru and waited almost 10 minutes before I got to the window and got my drink. But that's not what made the experience negative because normally I don't care to wait especially if I go through the drive thru because hey it happens. It was when I got to the window and had to deal with the cashier, he said hi and that's pretty much it. He said "here" when he gave me my drink and then shut the window. I didn't get a "thank you, have a good day"...or even a "bye".  Now I know it was super early but WOW!!   I gave two stars because I still loveeee Starbucks! Might just not visit this location again.

My cousin introduced me to this place and I gotta admit this might be my new spot for my nails. The ladies are really nice and I inviting. The salon is clean and comfortable.   Had a pedi done here a few times and always left happy and even more important, relaxed!!  Check them out ladies!

Love this place!! The ladies are super nice and quick. Stopped by because my nails were in need of some help but only had a short amount of time. I was able to explain what I wanted and she got to work!  I wouldn't say she rushed but she was pretty quick. Best part my nails looked great. The gel was super smooth, even and shiny. Now I know you might be thinking they should always be, but trust me I have had them done (at other nail salons) and they were not so nice.   She was super friendly. I will be back for sure!!

Always wanted to try this place, still not sure how I never had in so long. Enjoyed a great lunch here and tried the shrimp fried rolls and silver noodle salad. They were both so delicious!!   I would be a little more cautious next time though with the spice. I ordered a 6 and it was a bit more spicy than I had probably wanted. I love spice and can usually handle it very well but this spice level threw me a challenge.   The service was friendly and attentive. They were quite busy too and they touched our table a satisfactory amount of times.   Can't wait to go back!!

Great family fun spot! Went for cosmic bowling and had a blast. The bowling area is definitely a great spot for all ages. The massive screens with music videos playing create a really fun, energetic atmosphere. The bowling alley is modern, clean and very inviting.   Will definitely be back!

Stopped by to get some pho and was really not pleased with our visit. We had been here a few times but granted it had been awhile. Half the things on their menu they were out of because they "were going to close for the holidays". I guess that was suppose to mean they didn't order food since they were going to close?!   We ordered the snoh and had asked for extra toppings. They gave us so much snoh and VERY little toppings (as you can see in pic below). Maybe it was just not the time to go since it was a couple days before Christmas, but if your not going to care about the food you serve before the holidays then you should just don't close for that time, just an opinion.  The service well let's just say it matched the food.

Love, love the family friendly aspect of this spot. My son always asks to go to Beach Cafe. It's pretty close to our house so we do frequent this place from time to time.   The decor is cute with swimsuits hanging from the ceiling. Beach boards and items all around and even more so the vibe of relaxation.   We rode our bikes since its not too far, enjoyed some yummy breakfast then worked off the calories on our bike ride home. Calories sooooo worth it. We enjoyed some amazing and fluffy French toast with some crisp bacon and sausage, and scrumptious Cali benedict.   We will be back for more reasons than the great food.

Cupcakes! Cupcakes! Our family has a thing...try cupcakes everywhere! Could be a lot of peoples thing lol. My sister in law saw them on cupcake wars so we had to try it.   Love the idea of being able to pick the filling and frosting. Create your own cupcake, fun idea! Tons of delicious flavors to choose from as well.   Aside from the idea of creating your own cupcake, the awe of their cupcakes ends there. Unfortunately the flavor of the cupcakes is a little on the bland side. I expected the sweet flavor of red velvet but it tasted like regular cake. The same for the strawberry, which I expected to be sweet, very bland..if it wasn't for the frosting the entire cupcake would be close to tasteless. The frosting saved the cupcake and was pretty much the entire taste.

Wanted to check out this burger place inside Paris. The place itself is pretty cool..TVs everywhere and a nice, upscale sports bar type spot. We went for dinner and it was pretty busy but we were seated within 15 min, not long at all. They were short staffed that night but the servers and manager were up front about it and let us know, more so we didn't feel forgotten or ignored.  Nice move! Though they were short our service was still very timely and adequate. Brittney & Alex were great!  Some must trys: Macaroni & cheeseburger bites Oreo Shake (really delicious) Turkery burger with egg Chicken wings Gravy fries (amazing)  Definitely a cool, must try spot

Visited this spot the other day with my family. We were trying to find something fun for the kids that wasnt in the AZ heat. We had some lunch and then played some games. It is a great spot for some fun and games for everyone in the family. The kid in me loves going for some fun. The games we play on our cells are now larger, more interactive and a lot more fun. Games we would play with regular household items are now score keeping and setup just for us. Kids will have a blast, my son always does. There is tons to do and play to keep kids occupied and happy for a few hours.   The place has food, drinks and games galore so its great for a night out with some friends or a nice, cool spot to take the kids. The one at desert ridge has a bowling alley and area for parties. Great place for company get togethers and social mixers.   Only downfall was the super slow service at the restaurant. We got there and there was only two tables sat but we waited almost 30 min for a salad and pretzel dogs. We had to ask about it twice before our food finally came. If it was busy thats one thing but with only 2 tables before us it shouldn't take 30 min to get out an app salad and 3 mini pretzel dogs.

Always drive by this place since it's close to my house and I love crepes so I'm always looking for a great spot. Tried it out today with my son after a bike ride and glad we did. I tried a chocolate, strawberry, banana crepe with whipped cream and my son had a milk tea boba. The crepe was delicious and not too sweet. Definitely hit the spot!  The boba was a bit soft and mushy but the milk tea was yummy.

This WAS the spot for our family for AYCE until our last visit. I know there was a change in management/ownership at some point in the last few months so I'm not sure if that is it but nonetheless, the restaurant and quality of food/service has changed a lot!   First, the portions of the plates on the AYCE menu have either shrunk or the plates they serve it on have gotten bigger. Second, coming from a family who is a coniseour of fish (raw and cooked) the quality of the fish is definitely not as fresh.   The service was for lack of better words confusing. They had maybe 4-5 people on the floor but only one was allowed to take orders?!? It took a long time for us to place our second round.  They kept saying she will be right with you. During our first order my son had ordered a California and Philadelphia roll, all of our food came out and after we asked about it they told us oh its coming right now. About 8 min later the rolls came....my family is in the F&B industry and we can tell when an item was forgotten to be placed. So just be honest and tell us you forgot to place the order it will be out soon vs. Oh ya it's coming right now.   Lastly, when it came to paying let's just say that was the last straw. I am really disappointed too since we did frequent this place ALOT. Have filled up numerous stamp cards over the last year or two.

Mother's Day Breakfast!! The elegance of Brio started off my day with ease. The host staff was welcoming and cordial. We had a reservation and we were seated within minutes so no real waiting.   I got to enjoy Berries & Cream stuffed French toast with applewood bacon. It was a bit overwhelming due to how sweet it was but what do you expect with stuffed French toast drizzled with honey and syrup. Nonetheless, it was yummy!!!   The service was ok. I felt like our server was getting irritated a couple times but then he would snap out of it. I get they were super busy so I just let it slide.   I have enjoyed happy hour at this venue many times and have always had a great time. Overall, still a satisfied Brio customer!

For reasons unknown my son likes to come here when we are at Town Square and each time we have gone I haven't really left thinking anything spectacular.   Service is hit or miss, mostly miss and food is good but nothing to really YELP about. Till our last visit...  We dined here last Friday night and our server, Brandi was awesome! She was friendly, attentive, suggested some good stuff and made us laugh. She touched the table just enough times for us to feel like we didn't have to search for someone if we needed something.   As for food, I tried the street tacos. The Korean short rib taco and chicken...really, really good! We also tried the poke stack, delicious!  I'm sure we will be back but I want Brandi's table

Enjoyed a wonderful dinner here a couple nights ago. Our server, Brandon, was attentive and had on the point suggestions throughout the evening. We started the evening with his personal recommendation of Gingo Shizuko "Divine Droplets" Sake, summed up, it was delicious!   Must trys: Big eye Tuna Pizza Lobster Carpacchio Seared Diver Scallops  To end the evening Cocunut Rice Cakes, Great!!!  Only downfall, the sommelier was a tad pushy. She didn't introduce herself as she approached our table and just jumped right into her "sales pitch". However, this was a minor detail to our overall evening, which was exceptional.

Had dinner with my friend here last night. Haven't really been a big fan of Thai food but really did like this place. Its a small, quaint place. We were welcomed right away and seated. They were not super busy but the place was adequately filled.    I had the duck salad very tasty. I love duck and had never seen it served as a salad so had to try it. It was served over a bed of spinach, not sure I loved that but the dressing was delicious.   I will have to try this place again!

I was at town square shopping and decided to stop in for lunch. I've always strayed away from this restaurant because the portions are huge! But gave it a shot to check it out since it's been awhile.  They have lunch portions still a lot but doable for a quick bite.  I had a wedge salad and fish tacos. Love the fish tacos, really good flavor with the mix of dressings. The wedge salad looked really pretty! Presentation of the salad was topnotch. Lots of toppings, definitely not just a wedge with salad dressing.   The widow burger was huge too!! There was a lot going on in the burger and was overcooked since we ordered it medium but overall the burger was really flavorful. A little overwhelming but I'm sure it will hit the spot for someone who's hungry and loves burgers!  Service was great. We got there a bit early so we avoided the rush but from the first hello to the final good bye, everyone was really nice and friendly.   They have a dessert fridge up front and oMg they all looked amazing!!! Too bad I was so full. Maybe next time!

Great spot to chill, watch the game and eat some great wings! My son loves this place and his favorite lemon pepper wings are always on our order.   The variety of wings they have is unreal, so much to chose from! Carribean jerk and garlic parmesan are my favorite.   We got to try this new sampler. It has so much good, honestly could be someone's meal. Mozzarella, flatbread, hummus, mushrooms...all so good!!!

Nice local spot. Pho is great on a cold, rainy day. We were greeted and seated right away.  The server was very friendly and attentive, granted they were not super busy.  The Jenni Phone we ordered was suppose to be a combination of everything but it maybe had 4 peices of rare steak and 3 strips of tripe. We were actually a bit disappointed because we have visited this location on several occasions and never felt the substance in the pho was insufficient. Maybe today was just an off day. Overall though the pho was still good. The spring rolls are always good!!

THE place for some great Hawaiian food!!   We came for lunch and they were just starting to pick up. The ladies who were working saw us come in said mahalo and were really inviting. We were seated right away and immediately our drink order was taken.   We had the loco moco and furikake poke. Bomb!!! The loco moco is huge!! This is definitely something tjay can be shared. The gravy smelled so good I could smell it while it was being carried to our table. The sunny side up eggs were a delicious and cooked just right.   The poke was fresh and good sized pieces with onions. The serving portion of poke that they give is very generous for the price. Definitely the spot for some great poke!

Amazing Filipino food in the phoenix area. I have been looking for a good spot in Phoenix and the food along with  the service I have experienced here, make it amongst my favorite places to go when I'm craving my moms cooking.  From the pancit, dinuguang, lumpia, adobo and lechon I can't ever decide what to eat. They serve as a 1, 2 or 3 item meal but also have the option to purchase single servings in various sizes.  Craving some good Filipino food....stop by

Sunday brunch!! Met some friends who were visiting from out of town, they call Serendipity "the place you just have to eat at when in Vegas". I love the ambiance of this place. Its fun, inviting and energetic.   The portions are huge and so delicious. Every entree has its own twist and is unique in its own way. We had he corn beef hash and hangover omelet. We didn't get the fries inside the omelete though. The omelet was definitely big enough to share.   The frozen hot chocolate is the signature item, if you visit you MUST try it.   Our server completed our experience. He was super friendly and welcoming. He checked on us and always made sure we were "doing great".

Seems each visit here tops the last. Enjoyed dinner here the other night and let me start by saying our server, Lance was quite impressive. He was on point in every way. From the first hello to the very last thank you and good bye he was super attentive, touched the table just the right amount of times and made sure we were truely enjoying our experience. The guests that were with me all commented on how great a server he was as well.   We all enjoyed different dishes and were all very satisfied. I was able to enjoy the mini tacos (listed as an appetizer but more than enough to fill in as a meal). The 3 bite tacos were topped with a mayo like sauce which added tons of flavor. Another guest had the ahi salad and was warned that the ponzu sauce can be a salty so don't pour it all on at once and FYI...That was a VERY good warning. Salad was good but be careful not to pour it all on. Kids were able to share a foot long hot dog and mini burgers, they enjoyed it.   Ended with a frozen Oreo hot chocolate! So Goooodddd!!!  Again..left a satisfied customer.

AYCE Korean buffet! Love this place. Been here several times and have to admit this time the food AND service were both up to par.  Love the kalbi and pork belly, the beef radish soup is delicious and the potato salad side dish is yummy!!!   Definite must try spot for some Korean bbq

Now this place was a true hidden gem! Secret now discovered.  A little history on this place (which I learned from a server) this used to be the hangout of the ratpack. Yes its that old, but the history behind the place and the aura it projects is a must tell and classic.   Unfortunately I only visited to enjoy and check out the raved about cocktails.  We enjoyed a few different cocktails and all were unique in its own way. I was a little skeptical because I am a vodka drinker and only 2 or 3 of the cocktails had vodka. The majority of the drinks contain gin. So I asked what they recommend and went for it.  Cocktails: Ramos Gin Fizz- Now this is a creamy creation. They warn you it will take awhile because there are 3 steps to making this drink all which require patience and time. I was really interested because one of the ingredients is egg white. Never seen or heard that being used. The drink was delicious, creamy, not too sweet and you couldn't even taste the alcohol. Definitely recommend this one!  Blood & Sand- honestly I only ordered it to see the presentation. They spark a mini fire blaze with the orane peel at the end. Get your video out! The drink was a bit strong and the scotch is pretty prominent, served like a martini.   Corpse Reviver No.2 - only thing I can remember is how much you could taste the absinthe  Vesper - it was one of the only ones with vodka. Served like a martini and definitely has that strong taste of alcohol.I guess with Gin & Vodka how could it not.   We sat at the bar and it was pretty busy so as far as service it was above average. The bartender was super busy the entire time, I wouldn't say he was the nicest guy but he made amazing cocktails.   I definitely want to go back and try the food. Half off all steaks for happy hour...FYI!

Really cute little hidden treasure. Located within a business complex this little shop is beyond cute. From the minute you enter you get the cozy, little neighborhood cafe feel. The place smelled amazing, full of fresh pastries, coffee and delicious sandwhiches and salads.   It is small so they can't seat many people inside so go early before the rush or you might end up taking it to go.  It's a fresh, unique cafe with a variety of sandwhichea, large portioned salads and thirst quenching coffees, juices and teas.   It does seem like a spot that is utilized mostly by the employees within the business complex, huge business complex so I am sure they get plenty busy. I'll admit that's why I stopped in, it's next to my building and I needed a quick bite. Sure happy I did stop in though, I'll be going back!  The service was great as well. We were welcomed right as we walked in, the girl who took our order was incredibly friendly , the guy who dropped our food off came back to check on us and as we left everyone said thank you and good bye! Awesome!!

First time here, we always pass this place so finally decided to stop in. The restaurant itself is a small, quaint place not a ton of seating but when we arrived we got sat right away. It did fill up quickly however so I'm going to chalk it up to good timing.   We intended to just go in for a few rolls but then we realized they had AYCE so why not. The AYCE menu is a smaller than some other AYCE menus offered at some near by sushi restaurants but pretty comparable to the type of sushis. The sushi was pretty fresh and came out fairly quick, which is a plus because nobody likes to wait too long in between orders.  Service was definitely one of the best I have had in any restaurant. I think the server was the owner or maybe manager, either way he was on top of it in every way! He made my son laugh a lot so that was another plus!

If it wasn't for their amazing sandwhiches I would be really inclined to leave them a big fat zero for their HORRIBLE customer service.   The service was bad from the minite we walked in. From the guy yelling (to the back) "2 customers up front" instead of a polite "hello, welcome to capriottis someone will be with you soon" (since he clearly didn't want to get up and help us) to the SUPER snotty girl behind the counter who looked at us like we were stupid when we asked for a cup for water. She replied with "oh we don't have anymore". Worst part she didn't offer any other solution or apology, she just said we are out PERIOD, gave us the "your dumb" look and giggled as we turned to the fridge with drinks since we had to now purchase a water bottle now since they were not able to ensure they had sufficient supplies to meet the needs of their customers.   Seriously one of the WORST experiences I have ever had. I understand restaurants run out of items at no fault of their own but the need to laugh and be rude is unacceptable. Definitely won't mind driving 10 min to the next Cappriottis to enjoy their great sandwiches minus the HORRIBLE service.

Customer service here is horrible. Ok, let me rephrase the floor help is horrible, cashiers were actually very friendly. Its unfortunate that by the time I got to the cashier, I was already so irritated the entire trip was over in my head.  If there was another pet store nearby that had what we needed I would have left but sadly the choices were slim and in the essence of not disappointing my son I dealt with it, paid and hope I never have to return again.

Let me start by saying the trip here started as a battle between my son and I. I wanted his hair cut, he didn't want to cut it. He's been wanting to grow out the top of his hair to get some look I wasn't clear of. We went and Sarah got to him right away. We talked and she pulled up a picture, showed it to my son and amazingly that was the hair do he was trying to get. She cleaned him up, taught him how to do his hair and with the biggest smile my son said "he really liked his hair". I REALLY liked his hair. He looked even more handsome than ever!! Now that I know the hairstyle he's been trying to get, thanks to Sarah!!   My son said he will go back now for a haircut as long as she does it. Haha. Deal!!!!

Love this spot. Super trendy & a great atmosphere. I am always looking for cute spots that are not on the strip, being a local of las vegas. We started with the chicken flautas which were served in a cream/guac sauce..super delicious with a tad bit of a kick. The kumbi shrimp linguine was amazing and the shrimp was true to its word "jumbo"(I've had shrimp linguine before that I had to hint for the shrimp in the noodles). Then to top it off we had a peice of red velvet, carrot and chocolate cake. They were moist, not super sweet and a great end to our meal.

First time visiting this location at Westgate. Showed up on a Saturday before it got too busy so we were able to chill for awhile and enjoy the music and atmosphere. Around 10 or so they started clearing the tables from the floor. The DJ was playing pretty good music and had the dance floor pretty full.   It was a cool spot to chill with some friends while visiting for a weekend.

Pretty good Korean food. Service was prompt and adequate.  Small, cute restaurant but the music they were blasting was a little odd considering it would go from Koran pop, to English slow jams and then edm, needless to say ambiance was a bit confusing.   Loved the kimchi fried rice, kalbi and bulgogi. We tried the spicy chicken wings with special sauce.  Still not sure what the sauce is but it was a little thick and not so spicy.  Its near my house so we will go back!

I actually used to really like this place and maybe this occurance was a one off with a bad seed (employee) but needless to say one bad experience can create a bad taste in your mouth for a very long time.   I came here for lunch and let me start by saying NOBODY was there yet. We ordered our food AT the same time but it came out separately. About 5 min passed between the first and second dish then about 10 min later we wondered where our 3rd dish was. Let me say the fact that nobody was around for 10 minutes isn't probably the best as far as customer service and/or possible revenue lossage for the risk of someone just walking out. So we finally find someone and we ask about our food, he said oh ya let me go check on it for you. He came back and asked us again what we were missing (so did he totally not hear us 2 min before)....we told him and then he said oh you didnt order that. We stare blankly at him and said yes we did, he continued to argue with us and even more INSULT us by pulling out his notepad and asked "if we wanted to see his paper". We stopped him right there and said no!  Are you SERIOUS?!? Customer service!!!   The food isn't horrible but with this incredibly insulting experience, I am pretty sure we will drive that extra 10 min to another Korean spot.

Great place for a quick, delicious breakfast. Stopped by with my son for a bagel sand which before his baseball game. The employee who took our order was friendly and full of smiles!! My son kept changing his order but she was patient and tried to help him through his decision.   I enjoyed a thinbagel with asparagus, mushrooms, swiss and egg whites. It was delicious and best it was under 300 calories (for those health nuts).   The cool thing I noticed they added a charging high top station in the middle. Cool spot to do some work whole enjoying breakfast. They serve coffee too so this could become a spot to check out now for some chill time!

Cool spot at town square. Stopped in for a quick lunch and the server was quick and friendly.    The place was filled with groups of men. The whole place is set up like a bar with high tops all over and wooden type booths, so the atmosphere is very chill and laid back. Definitely a place to go to watch the game while enjoying a few beers.   Tried to Pale Ale flight loved the Kona. The apple walnut salad was delicious and refreshing filled with crisp apple pieces, sweet walnuts and a very tasty mix of lettuce and dressssing.   I like trying new spots, glad I checked this one out.

Really enjoy this spot, its close to the house and when we are craving some Hawaiian food this is usually our go to. We had called in a fairly large order the other day for pick up. When we arrived the total seemed quite high but we didn't question it, then when we went through the food we realized the order was incorrect. When we brought it to the attention of the cashier she was beyond RUDE.  We reviewed our order and even had the person recite it back to us on the phone, so how the order was further messed up is unclear. Nonetheless, she continued to argue and make it our fault. I understand mistakes happen but in a service industry correcting the error is usually the best course of action.  Very poor customer service! Good thing their food is still delicious!

Always heard about this local spot and seen it many times driving by so we decided to check it out. After reading the reviews we were a bit weary with the kind of service we would receive. But we were pleasantly surprised, the service was welcoming, timely and we were checked on a good amount of times.   The food was amazing! I felt like pancakes and asked the server which ones she recommends. She recommended the LIPs & SMITTY. I'd never had mint chocolate chip pancakes so I ordered the SMITTY and it was, as my son would say, Bomb! The single pancake serving was huge (for one pancake). It wasn't too sweet so I was able to eat the whole thing, the whipped cream and mini chocolate chips on top were the perfect addition. Definitely recommend!!  My son had the French toast and he fully enjoyed it, he even asked if he could have more. The orange juice we had was freshly squeezed and actually a surprise since most restaurants don't have fresh juice.   Definitely try this place it's delicious!!!

Got there just before the rush so we were seated fairly quick. I am on this kick to try all their pancakes! Today I had the red lips and since I LOVE red velvet I was quite excited to try it. I was a tad bit disappointed however, the red lips are sold as being topped with fresh stawbwerrues and whipped cream cheese. Mine however did NOT come with fresh strawberries as a matter of fact it didn't come with strawberries at all. I was going to ask the server but I guess this was time the rush hit because i couldn't seem to be able to get the attention of one. It wasn't a huge deal so I just let it go and dug in. The pancake was delicious so in the end all was good. Maybe next time I'll get the fresh strawberries.   My son had the breakfast burrito and my newphew had the French toast...they loved it!!

I think this might just be our new breakfast spot. We were sat fairly quickly and greeted by our server right away. They were quite busy so that prompt acknowledgment was a plus.   This time we tried the Florentine eggs Benedict, Philly skillet, biscuit & gravy and a pancake with fresh strawberries. All of it was amazing!   Only thing we were sat in the back in a booth and it got pretty hot and very stuffy. Eating temperature hot food and sitting in a hot environment makes dining a bit uncomfortable. It might have been because we were next to the kitchen as well. Maybe next time we will just be more conscious and ask not to sit in the back.   Still really like this place!

Another impeccable visit!! What else can I say about this place? It's GREAT!! We got there when they were in their lunch rush but we were seated fairly quickly. I tried something new the veggie omelete (part of their healthier meals) and wow it was full of veggies!!   Kids enjoyed the French toast, cinnamon pancake, red velvet pancakes and biscuit and gravy. Everything looked and tasted wonderful. We all kinda picked off each others plate, I mean how could we not, HaHa!   Our server was so peppy and energetic, she completed our experience for sure!!!

Im always on the look out for pastry bakeries. I actually was looking for a place that made macaroons and so i yelped and found this local delight. The shop is small and I was expecting more pastries to be out but with the over 20 some flavors of macaroons I couldn't complain. I tried a good handful of flavors and I was quite impressed. They were very good, soft yet firm (as a macaroon should be) and quite tasty. The red velvet macaroon . I also tried the peach mousse it was so moist and delicious.   The bakery is kind of in an obsolete area but if your in the wear valley and feel like some sweets, check it out.

They have bottomings! Haha. Toppings but items to put on the bottom. FIRST time I have ever seen this so its memorable. Bottoming's such as oreos, granola, oatmeal cream pies and other fun stuff to put on the bottom and THEN add the yummy yogurt and fun toppings!   I was a little nervous because I had read all the reviews and the one thing everyone kept saying was they couldn't get their own samples and that when it's busy nobody is available to help. Maybe we came at a good time but we had no problem with this. Right when we walked in there was someone asking us if we wanted to sample anything. She was super friendly and not rushed, even though I do think she was alone. The place was full so again maybe we came after the rush.    The yogurt was all good, sampled the mint and it was delicious! Tried the salted caramel and it was definitely caramel flavored, a bit sweet for me but I'd get a little dapple.   Fresh fruit, chocolates, sauces, all only added to the sweetness of this yogurt trip!

Every time I stray away from my regular Starbucks I seem to be highly disappointed. Visited this location because of convenience and really wish I hadnt. I used to think Starbucks was the epiphany of quality customer service but lately I am realizing the consistency of "customer service" is not carried from location to location.   I am still confused when the barista tells me this isn't a "real" starbucks, when explaining why a reward, email promo code or app can't be used, but I have never really been bothered because sometimes that is just the way it is. Today's experience however was more shocking however.   I went to pay and buy a protein box along with a FRAP and when she told me the total I asked why it was so much. She told me the protein box was $8, when I went to point out to her it states $4.95 on the box it was blacked out with a sharpie. I was so bewildered since I KNOW I had JUST looked at it to see how much it was before I bought it. Then I noticed the sharpie in her hands. I didn't say anything but I wanted to verify, so I went to look at the other boxes and sure enough they WERE NOT blacked out and they were priced at $4.95!!!   I was so in shock that this employee tried to straight up rip me off!! NEVER going back and I'm not one to recommend against a place, but in this case I highly recommend against visiting this location.

Prosciutto & Arugala on a white pizza....amazing! If that's all I can say then that says it all. Let me start by saying I am not a pizza person so I was a bit reluctant to try this spot out but without a doubt I was quite pleased.   This pizza was really good. I loved the white pizza! We also got to try the caprese and ceaear salad. The cesear salad has chunks of Parmesan (I believe) sheds on it, yumm! The caprese mozzarella and tomato were very generous sizes. I wish the balsamic was put on it for us but I get that they want to allow patrons to put as much as they would like.   I wanted to try the dessert but I was so full, maybe next time!

Had some friends from out if town who wanted Japanese. Was looking for a late night spot and thought about this place. I had heard tons of great things about this place so was excited to try this place out. Sadly, as soon as we got there we realized it's not really a place for a group of people, we were only a group of 6. The restaurant is small, so after about 40 min we were sat. We got there in time for happy hour so we were actually able to try a lot of dishes.    Must trys: Yellowtail with jalapeño Tuna sashimi bowl Octopus dumplings (not the name on menu) Fried squid Mackarel sashimi salad  The salmon sashimi was really good and fresh!   Another thing that makes this place different is the variety of flavors they have for edamame! Definitely try the garlic butter, DELICIOUS!!  Service was pretty good,no real complaints. I'm not against going back again but probably wouldn't go with a group of people.

I suppose this location isn't big on customer service. After reading all the reviews clearly management hasn't caught on to the things they should fix to ensure they stand out from the other fast food places around. They are pretty lucky they are the only taco bell in about a 5 mile radius.  I'm sitting here in drive thru line, got in like at approximately 12:21 its 12:42 and I am still in like to get my good with one car in front of me. Its a good thing I don't have a 30 minute lunch.

Went for dim sum this past weekend.  Definitely different from the normal "China town" dim sum spots I've been too. The restaurant is fairly large so we were seated right away, even though they were actually quite busy. First thing I noticed was how modern and clean the place was, always a plus. The carts came around right away and the selection was great. Wasn't all the typical dumplings, steamed (3 peices) dishes.  There was actually alot I wanted to try but didn't get the chance to.   Definitely liked the duck, shrimp, egg custard filled and BBQ pork filled buns. I had asked for a particular dish 3 times, they kept saying it would be out but it never came. I finally asked a last time before we left and asked for it to go, didn't realize till I got home and opened the to go box how tiny the item was compared to other dim sum restaurants. Nonetheless, it was still delicious.   Only downfall was the extremely rude cashier at the end. Good thing our experience with her was super short SNF on our way out.

Super irritated with the lady working the counter. Maybe she didn't hear me when I said hello since her glaring stare pretty much started the 2 min interaction extremely uncomfortable. Or maybe it was the question I had about the blizzard that confused her to state at me yet again in complete dismay but oh my do I never want to see this lady again. Either she was incredibly out of it or she was just THAT rude...whatever the case never want to see her again.  Darn too cuz we love the blizzards.

Great breakfast spot!   Love their waffles with fruit and whip cream. Had the bananas this time and it was very delicious. The waffle was made just right! Definite must try!  The service here is always friendly and around when needed.  Love the egg card that's up that customers can flip if they need someone, cute idea!

Love the desserts here! What can I say I'm a sucker for awesome goodness!!!  Took some friends here who were visiting from out of town and introduced them to the yumminess of honey toast, not just any regular honey toast but with fresh fruit, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. Talk about mouth watering its great, just don't go if your on a diet. You know that they say the best things are usually not good for you.   We also shared shaved ice with strawberries and kiwi. It was different from some other shaved ice, added more condensed milk to make the ice softer and smoother but definitely not bad.   Want something good to eat after dinner....this is a definite contender!

THE spot to hit up for delicious pancakes. Not regular buttermilk pancakes biut a variety of delicious flavors ranging from orange dreamsicle, lemon riccota, cinnabun, chocolate chip, banana and of course RED VELVET!!  Cream cheese frosting   This place is always busy and once you have visited you know why. Their specialties are the pancakes so save your appetite and pick between a short stack (3), full stack (6) or a full breakfast with eggs and your choice of meat with a side (2) pancakes.   The service is par but the food more than maksa up for it.

Screaming Vengeance! That's all I have to say! Ramen & spicy...SUPER spicy this is for you. I am a big spice person and this was definitely among some of the spicest I have ever had. Everything in it was mouth and eye watering. The ramen here is delicious and full of flavor.   The menu is pretty small and really only consists of ramen choices so if your not going to eat ramen this isn't the place for you.

Cute spot! We don't have any revolving sushi places where I live and always wanted to check one out. The sushi wasn't amongst the freshest I've ever had but I guess you can't expect it to be super fresh if its revolving around for awhile.   Albacore was really good!  Definitely an experience that sushi lovers should check out.  After we got our bill I realized why there are no revolving sushi places where I live. When there are all you can eat sushi restaurants for $25 and the sushi is fresh and made as you order, revolving sushi probably wouldn't make it.

The place was a bit hard for me to locate especially since I don't know downtown well, I didn't realize it was inside the Palomar hotel. The ambiance of the restaurant is chic and very eye appealing, it's trendy & unique design and furniture make it a definite posh spot for an exquisite ladies night out or afternoon catch up sesh.   We were seated right away by a very personable host & greeted by our server within 2 minutes of being sat.  He started us with some cocktails and appetizers while we perused the menu.   Some definite must try- Fried Green Tomato: sounds a bit strange right, but they were surprisingly good. Up for a new treat, these are for you! Deviled Eggs: bacon jam I don't need to say anything else  Shishito peppers: the furikaki and aioli ... Yum! Seared ahi salad: the bed of lettuce they used was fresh and a refreshing variety when added with a piece of the seared ahi  Cocktails- loved my dirty martini but was shocked when I tried the Lawless. The drink is made with bitters, wild turkey and this awesome smoke type concoction that adds flavor to the glass itself. Honestly, watching it be made was the fun part!   Parts of the restaurant over look a part of city scape which can be beautiful so if ever on a date night be sure to request a window table.

We eat here often but lately I think they are slacking. We usually order the family meal so this last time we ordered the 12 piece with 3 sides.   Let's start with the chicken, it was literally stuffed into the styrafoam container. Ever see 12 pieces of chicken stuffed into a small container....ya who knew chicken could actually get to smashed.   Coleslaw, I would think that when you order a side the container would at least be filled to the top...nope try filled HALF WAY. Yup, so you order a large and pay for it but actually end up going home with a small.  The service was never top notch pretty sure its not stressed but when you can see the workers you would think they would at least act like they want your business.  So disappointing!

Heard about this spot and been wanting to try it, today i finally did. I LOVE crepes and have been on the lookout for a really good crepe spot.  Gotta say, happy I finally found one and close to home.   The crepe was delicious and not too sweet, which is even better. Fresh strawberries and a really creative way of assembling it.  Got to watch them make it from.the start and I was quite impressed. We also tried the eclairs and mini chocolate puffs, delicious!!  The service wasn't amongst the best considering nobody said hello when we walked in even though there were two people working up front, the guy that helped us didn't seem happy at all and we had to wait literally 12 minutes for our crepe AND we were the only ones in the place.   Good thing their pastries and crepes are yumm!!

As a donut fanatic this place islike heaven. The variety of donuts and how they are so different from the everyday donut shops is what I like.   Tried the strawberry shortcake with its fresh strawberries, creamy whiped topping and soft glazed donut base it was amazing!! Loved the Oreo donut with Oreo cream inside, wow!!  I keep hearing about the fat elvis but unfortunately did not see it when we were there, maybe next time.   Got to admit it was definitely worth all the extra calories I gotta burn off at the gym!!!

My lil sis is a frequent visitor of this spot and has tried almost everything on the menu. So when it came to suggesting a place to eat it was easy. I love sushi so I was totally open to try and new spot when I was visiting for the weekend.   The ambiance was nice, inviting and very open. I was greeted by a lovely hostess who seated us right away. We opted to sit outside since it wasn't super hot yet. It was nice to talk, eat and people watch.   Our server greeted us and took our drink order, we weren't very sure on what to order so we asked a few questions. She unfortunately didn't seem too knowledgeable on the drinks or what was or wasnt on the menu. Nonetheless we ordered some wine and a sparkling lychee. The lychee drink wasnt too sweet which was good but it didn't have a very prominent lychee taste, so that was a bit disappointing.    We had a few dishes and just shared them. A couple recommendations that stood out the spicy, chili tofu. Delicious, it had a crunchy outer layer which was just right. The spicy sashimi salad was really good as well. The dressing was light and not too overwhelming with the fish. Yellowtail jalapeño, definitely try! Who doesn't like Yuzu sauce?!!   To end your meal you must try the signature green tea waffle and ice cream. Sounded a lil different when they told me about it but I must admit, my curiosity paid off this time. Sooooooo good!!!!!!

First time to Jimmy Johns. Loved the idea behind the unwhich (sand which wrapped in lettuce). Had the beach club and really enjoyed it.    Other than the tad bit of unorganization with the sub making line (2 sandwhiches were made incorrectly, 1 was just not made) the service is very welcoming and friendly.

Super cute, posh spot in City North. Enjoyed lunch here after visiting M3V on our girls day. My friend had told us about this amazing taco flight.   The restaurant itself is really inviting, fun and enjoyable. We enjoyed a salsa flight along with the taco flight. 15 tacos (chicken, veggie, fish, pork and carne asada) so yummy!!! Perfect size and full of flavor! Definitely a must try!

Was in town again for work had some time before we were leaving so we decided to hit up this super cute spot for happy hour. Had been here before so was a little excited to have their taco flight.   The taco flight is definitely enough to share. 3 of each (chicken, veggie, carne asada, pork and fish) taco for a total of 15 tacos!! My favorite are the fish tacos topped with red lettuce and topped with their pico de hallo, amaaaazing!!! The carne asada tacos are filled with meat, definitely hearty.  I also enjoyed a hot mango margarita. Like spice and tequila, this is a must try!   Our server Yohanis was attentive and touched our table just enough for us to not feel negelected. He was on point and definitely defined great customer service! Thank you!!!

Great spot for some yummy drinks and some desserts. Tried a few items there but definitely love the house special. The mix of boba, pudding and jelly is great. Also love the volcano green tea.   They came out with more flavors for the house special that I definitely want to try.   The owners are super nice and friendly. I think its only the husband and wife who work but they are pretty quick and even when busy they are working as quickly as possible to get the goodness out to the customers.

I wanted to try something new, so I decided on the Sunrise slush. Mango slush with assorted jelly and green apple jelly on the bottom. I am so glad I tried it. It's really a refreshing and the assortment of jelly's are a great addition.   The place is chill you can play cards, jenga or just catch up with friends.  I have said it once and I will again, the owner is super sweet. Always smiling and welcoming.   5 stars!!

We frequent this pho spot every time we are in AZ (which is a lot). Gotta say for the price it is a pretty good deal. We started coming here after our previous pho spot started skimping on the food they put in the pho. That definitely isn't an issue here, the pho is filling and full of meat, noodles and great broth. The egg rolls and spring rolls are fresh and hot as well.    This is a go-to spot for delicious pho!

Great spot for boba & macaroon ice cream sandwiches! Fun spot to chill and hang out with friends. Its by my house so I'll definitely be frequenting this spot. Got to try the vanilla macaroon with mint chocolate chip. First, one of the best mint chocolate chip ice creams I have ever had. Second, macaroons were incredible. Macaroons being one more of my favorite desserts I'm pretty picky and I definitely like these ones.   They have many types of macaroons and lots of choices for ice cream. Stop by you won't regret it!!!   Service too..the guys where super friendly and nice. They were super busy too when we went on a Friday night.

First time here for dinner. Have to say I was impressed. The restaurant is very beautiful with great decor. The presentation of the food is very eye appealing and the service we received was top notch. The timing of the food was quite fast as well.  Overall, a very pleasant dinner was enjoyed.   Only disappointing fact was we had made reservations for the teppan table and after waiting for 20 minutes (in the lobby) we were told it would be another 30 minutes because they were behind and one cook had called in. We asked realistically how long would it really be and after the hostess told us there were still 3 tables the cook needed to attend to before he would get to the table we would be at, we decided to just sit at the regular dining table. We were a bit excited for the teppan table but we realized it would be too late, which we did see about an hour into our meal that the cook finally did get to the teppan table we would have been at.  (-1 on stars)  We tried the baked mussels and stuffed mushrooms, they were pretty tasty. Only thing it was a bit of an overload on the crab meat topping.   Loved the shishito peppers, yellowtail jalapeño carpachio and to end the night the honey toast was amazing!!!

Always seen this restaurant while driving on Rainbow, love crab so of course I was curious about the food. Went after my sons baseball game and wasn't really sure what to expect. There was 6 of us so we ordered some apps, calamari, bacon wrapped scallops and oysters. By far the bacon wrapped scallops were the best and accompanied by an amazing sauce (not sure what it is but its absolutely delicious).  I ordered the peel and eat spiced shrimp and other than being fairly large sized shrimp nothing else really stood out about them. We also tried the crab cake sandwich which was a decent sized cake on a bun. The crab cake was very tasty. My son ordered the popcorn shrimp and I'm assuming he liked it because he ate it all up.   The service was great. Everyone from the minute we walked in were very pleasent and attentive. It would be a good, chill place to watch sports games and enjoy some seafood.

This was a little hidden gem. Location isn't prime but I gotta say it kinda fits the experience. It's located off the corner behind sporting life bar so not very noticeable from the street but this quaint restaurant was a definite find.   The employees right off the bat were welcoming, friendly, full of smiles and so courteous. Kinda felt home like, we were seated right away and greeted soon after. We went during lunch so there were a good amount of customers.   We enjoyed quite a few dishes. Excuse me for I am not sure of the names they are called on the menu but I'll do my best. We shared a chicken katau meal, which is quite a large portion. We enjoyed the soft shell crab with tgis amazing ponzu sauce, octupus & cucumber salad, fried squid legs and these octopus cream type balls (no clue what it's called). Everything was so good and quite filling. They were all served fresh and hot and quickly too.   Cutest thing is you get to make your own katau sauce. You grind the seseame yourself and then add the sauce. Different right? I like different.   I'll be back for sure!

We are a huge sushi loving family. We have tried many Japanese restaurants on the strip & all over Las Vegas and this restaurant is a great local surprise. The food was really great, tasted fresh & definitely hit the spot. My 8 year old loves sushi and he has definitely told us when he doesn't like a place...he loved this place. Definitely recommend the yellow tail and whitefish ponzu, as well as the cute bite sized sashimi tostados. The staff was incredibly friendly and our server offered up some great "must try" suggestions.

Visited this spot and was yet again very pleased.  Tried the waffle with berries and of course the mini donuts. Both were amazing.   If your hungry definitely recommend the MTO breakfast. It has everything and more!!!  Mike, the GM was great, stopped by our table and made sure our visit was enjoyable.

Was up north and was looking for something to eat. We yelped and this restaurant came up. My cousin got so excited and was like we have to go there. I had seen their other location on rainbow before and had wondered about the place so I agreed and we went.  Super glad we did too!! We walked in and we were greeted right away, SUPER friendly guy, asked if we had been there before and explained how it worked. He was patient especially since we had kids who wanted to order on thier own. Service is definitely 5+stars!  So its kinda like chipotle/subway order as you move down the line and create your own item. I had a wheat flour burrito with chicken and kalua pig with seaweed rice and mango salsa (I believe). It was amazing!!! Ended my meal with the coconut bark, I'm not a big lover of coconut either but it was really good.

Ok so let me start by saying this place was a PLEASANT SURPRISE. The restaurant isn't in a fancy spot, but more of a corner of a hidden strip plaza. Not a place you would expect to find a hidden gem.   The menu at first glance is quite astonishing, the variety of food is all mouth watering. Appetizers I haven't ever seen in any other restaurant, so we ended up ordering  a few.   *Soft shell crab tempura - great sauce and generous size *Shrimp tempura- different BC it doesn't come with tempura sauce but rather lemons and salt, new! *Hamachi Kama - so much meat wow! So good! *Oyster spoons - like oysters? this is a must try! *BBQ Pork Belly - delicious *Yellowtail poke tacos - definitely a new one for me but so glad I tried it, it has a kick of wasabi! Yes!! *yellowtail with Serrano peppers - my favorite!!!! *Uni Trio - not a fan of the dumpling, the spoon was a little salty , hand roll was yum!! *Mochi- mango & strawberry *Tempura ice cream - vanilla  Topping it off was the great service, she was super friendly and always paid attention to our table.   Will definitely be back!

Actual visit would be more like 3.5  Our family is an avid Hot & Juicy visitor. We started going to the Henderson location because it was larger and didn't feel as congested as the other two locations, even though it is much farther.   The food like always is delicious!!!! Definite 5 stars. There were 10 of us and most of us got shrimp, different sauces and spice but were all very satisfied. We tried the new Cajun calamari, definite must try. It is just the right amount of spice. Oysters tasted fresh!   Unfortunately, the deduction of stars was for service. We waited for about 35 minutes for our food which wasn't too bad since they had told us they were a bit behind but one of the people with us didn't get thier order and after asking twice where it was (& everyone just saying I'll check)...another 20 min went by and his food finally came but was wrong! Additionally, we asked for another rice but they said it would be 30 min for rice (we said never mind). The server was apologetic but honestly she didn't even seem to know what was going on with our order.   It was a busy night so maybe that played a part, but overall the food is definitely worth coming back for!

Boom! This place is quite the discovery. So I had it bookmarked for awhile and I am really glad I finally got to try it. We arrived right before the lunch rush and when I say rush the place was packed when we left. No real motif to the place, more just like a local bar/restaurant with simple tables and no hostess. I love these types of places! We were greeted as we walked in and seated right away.   So the food is a mix of Mexican and Korean, two foods I really do enjoy so I was excited. We tried the dak bulgogi tacos with lettuce, the bulgogi bowl with fried eggs, spam masubi and the pork belly masubi with a fried egg. All of it.....amazing!   The masubis were a large portion and a definite reason to go back. Definitely recommend this delicious spot!

Customer service really needs help at this store. We walked in and an employee literally walked right in front of us (within arms reach) looked at us and said NOTHING. He went to continue to fold clothes or something by the entrance of the door. As we walked out I said to him "thanks have a good day" and again NOTHING!!! Wow now that's bad.

This cute, little, diner like custard shop is definitely a sweet spot! They only have 3 flavors a day (vanilla, chocolate and flavor of the day) and they are offered in a variety of ways (concrete, floats, cones, sundaes). The custard is way better than ice cream.   Definitely a good find for someone with a sweet tooth!

Some friends from out of town told me about this place, they raved and raved about this drink. Of course I had to see what it was all about. Its a cute, little shop with lots of choices as far as drinks. They have boba, smoothies and dessert drinks. I tried the #4 and my friends had the #10. Mine was more tart while thiers was more creamy. They were all filled with a lot of yumminess. Mine had lychee, grass jelly, red tapioca and jackfruit. It was definitely filling and tons of flavor.   In the mood for a great Asian dessert/drink check this place out. You will want to go back and try other ones.  I DID...we went again today and I got the #10

Quite shocked at how hot dogs can be done up to become gourmet. This spot does that, fancy hot dogs for sure.   Fancy cheeses, grilled mushrooms, specialty sauces topped on plump franks all equals delicious!   This quaint shop adds some flare and uniqueness to the linq. Its a small, casual shop that offers many different varieties of hot dogs, a couple burgers and crinkle cut fries.  I tried the fun-ghi and it was bomb! Grilled mushrooms, added some jalapeños, cheese and a special aioli sauce on top of a hot dog all equalled AWESOME!   It is a lil pricey but then again it is Vegas and it is different  I'll be back!!

Love this concept. They wash and style your hair for a very reasonable price. Have a night out and want to feel some glam in your hair style? This is the place for you. The wash, blowdry and style was well worth it.   I was attending a charity gala and wanted to get my hair styled. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she did a great job. I loved it!!!  Only reason for taking a star away was the initial service. Totally NOT my stylist fault, but definitely recommend some training on booking appointments and/or greeting. First, i stood there for almost 5 minutes and NOT one hello or anything. Ok, i take that back the person who opened the door for me said hello. Then i was told about 3 times I wasn't scheduled ONLY for her to find my name 5 minutes later. Uh, what were you looking at that you didn't see my name? Checking in literally took 15 minutes. It was really frustrating needless to say.

Tawainese hot pot!! I was super excited to visit this place especially since it is so close to my house. I read a lot of the reviews and many of them spoke of Boiling Point in California as a comparison. So since I happen to love Boiling Point I was extremely curious.   I had driven by this place so many times but with the name Pot Tea I really had no idea what kind of place it was.   Service was great. Super friendly and attentive. Not sure if its a family ran restaurant but they seemed to have plenty of workers and the food came out in a timely manner. We started with the chicken wings which were really good. Then I had the spicy miso seafood pot. So much seafood, seriously I was stuffed. The spice was definitely there and had tons of flavor. We also tried the rib eye pot again so much food. The pot doesn't look like a lot but it's filled with tons of yummy food.   I'll be back sooner than later!

Let me start by saying I LOVE DONUTS!!! I had heard of this place for awhile but I was finally in the area and got to try it. I loves the whole idea of creating your own donut. These are definitely not your typical donuts and since they make them as you order they are always fresh!   We created our own donuts; mint glaze with vanilla wafers, strawberry glaze with mini marshmallows, and peach glaze with cinnamon sugar.   We also bought a dozen of thier features donuts to take home. Definitely try strawberry shortcake & blueberry hill.  A must try spot!!

Super fun spot! My son always asks if we can go when we are in AZ. We really need one of these in Vegas. Its a chill spot to go with family, have a fun night out with friends or just by yourself to hit some balls, major stress reliever. The atmosphere is fun and exciting, lots going on.  Been here a few times and always left very happy!  Unfortunately, this last visit our service was short of horrible. We sat at the bay for almost 15 min before I finally tracked down someone and asked for our server. What made it even worse was the table right next to us (5 males) had been checked on by same female server 3 times (when we started counting) without even acknowledging us, imagine our surprise when we realized that same female server was the one who ended up attending to us before passing us off to yet another server (who BTW was actually really great).

Finally got to visit this restaurant after a long time waiting. Luckily for me it's open late!   We stopped in with some friends visiting from Hawaii after hanging at the LiNq for awhile. We were welcomed right away and seated at a table by the window. The atmosphere was popping and full of energy. We were greeted by Scott our server and he went over the late night menu and took our drink order.   Service was awesome. Scott was personable and attentive. He touched our table enough times that we felt acknowledged. Alex, the manager came to check on us as well which was nice to know the manager is involved as well in the customer service of the restaurant.   The food came out fairly quickly. I tried the fireball whisky wings and vegas fries. The fries are definitely different, a good different.  They are twice fried with buffalo sauce so its got a kick. The whisky wings sure give you a jolt of spice. Beware though if you are not a fan of spice. I love it so they were bomb to me!!!  Everything on the menu has its own twist which makes Guy Fieris menu one to stand out. Check out this spot for sure...

So happy I found this spot. I was in town visiting and I wanted to get my toes done. THANK YOU yelp!  Yup, I just searched for one on yelp and read some reviews. This place had some pretty good reviews and best yet it allows you to make an appointment right from the yelp site.   I made an appointment and I guess they were running a bit behind. I unfortunately didnt check my vms so I didn't get the message but they got me in pretty fast, they still got me started before my actual appointment time! Score!!   The man (manager I think) up front was so friendly and welcoming. We chatted for a minute while i picked my color then he lead me back to my chair.  I got an amazing pedicure and felt so relaxed after all was said and done. I kinda like the fact that use timers for the massages. Especially if you sell the pedicure package specifying a certain amount of "massage" time, it's a good way to ensure clients don't feel jipped if not alotted the entire time. I also like the fact they use anew liner and set of tools for each client. Makes me worry less about how sanitary the shop and tools are when they work on me.  When I'm back in town and looking for a nail shop this will be my stop!

LOVE this place! Been here on many occasions and have never been disappointed. Stopped in and had the Sunday Sundae, a special sundae they make up every Sunday. Started to frequent the Sundaes and attempt to make it as much as I can!  The warm, friendly greeting upon walking in to the sincere good bye as we leave all help create the epic delivery of customer service.  The vibe in the place carries and is honestly just a really hip, cool spot to enjoy unique entrees all throughout the day.  Still my favorite the Tu-Nuts!

Never fails, Skinnyfats hit the spot again!! Went for breakfast this time and enjoyed the Wrap Supastar. It was  a huge burrito but I didn't feel full and heavy after I finished. It had egg whites, avocado, chicken and spinach with a really yummy cilantro, lime dressing. It was really good and healthy!! Love this place more & more!!

Had always seen this place when I'm at Stacks and Yolks so I was more than eager to try it.   Honestly, it was really just like any other terriyaki/hawaiin/japanese fast food restaurant. The food wasn't bad don't get me wrong but nothing really stood out about it. The price however did, its actually a little bit pricey for what it is.   So there really is only 3 options on the menu but the concept of picking your own protein and side adds a little fun to the process. What I liked however was their "sauce bar". They had quite a few different sauces to pick from to add to your meats. My favorite the wasabi sauce, DELICIOUS! The sauce bar definitely made the experience different and worth the trip.

Love this place! Always my go-to spot for vietnamese sandwhiches. Love the baguettes, makes the sandwhich taste so much better! Never disappointed!   Best addition is the passion tea Italian soda. All the yumminess inside is great!!

Called to see of there was a wait and the man said no..gave him my name said I was on my way and he said great we have a table reserved. Get there and we wait about 3 min before someone actually acknowledges us (even though about 4 employees literally walked right in front of us), we were told it would be just a minute they need to clear a table (but we could clearly see there was NO empty tables so which one she was going to clear was a mystery)... Was told again by another employee it would be just another minute....after about 15 minutes we just walked out.   We called, left a name and then waited almost a total of 25 min...only to be ignored, lied to and leave super irritated.   Horrible!

Trendy spot in Scottsdale. Had dinner here with some friends and had a lovely time. Its a small place with mostly outdoor seating. It wasn't too bad the night we visited so it was nice to dine outdoors.   I had the duck wings. Anyone who knows anything about duck meat knows the wings done have a lot of meat so I was a bit worries it wouldn't be enough to fill me up, surpringsly it did,I didn't even finish it. It was really good and a must try for duck lovers! Like me!!   This is a spot I would think of for a chill night out with some friends!

Really happy I discovered this place.   Love Porto's in California and crave the cheese rolls, like I do? Well you are in luck...cuz the cheese rolls here are pretty much the same! So delicious.   Want something even more delicissssh? Malasadas! Yup and they have a variety of fillings they can put inside.   I not only tried the two things above I also enjoyed a lychee slush with boba. The lychee flavor stood out, which I tend to look for because I have had lychee drinks before where the lychee flavor was faint if at all.    I can't wait to go back and try more of their dishes, desserts and drinks!!!

Had an excellent lunch today in Downtown Summerlin at Wolfgang Puck. Upon arrival they were pretty busy but we were greeted with a warm welcome and seated promptly. We were able to enjoy a scenic, peaceful view and ambiance while we dined on the patio. Definitely recommend the truffle chips w maytag blue cheese and  shishito peppers with yuzu to start and the apple crostada to end. I was able to enjoy their special of the day which was a chicken salad sandwich with cranberry walnut bread and sprouts, amazing! Wolfgang yet again ceases to amaze!

Had lunch here with a group of people after spending the morning at Mt. Charleston.  We weren't seated right away, since we did come alt the peak of their lunch, but the manager and hostess adequately informed us of the status and we were seated in a reasonable amout of time.  I don't really remember many servers names but the one we had today, Walter was amazing!! He was slammed and we could tell,  but no matter how busy he was and how much running around he had to do (and he was running all over alot) he wasn't rude, he didn't forgot anything, he checked on us plenty and best part he was extremely friendly.   The food was your typical buger and salad place. We did try the tower of onion rings and doh-nuts...yumm!!!!

Friends in AZ kept telling me about this spot so we finally got to try it. I love Vietnamese sandwhiches so you understand why it was a must try.  Final analysis, very good. My son even liked it and he's not really into Vietnamese sandwhiches. He had the one with a fried egg, I tried a bite and it definitely added a new taste to the sandwhich. I had the special combo and truly enjoyed it. The bread is different from most Vietnamese sandwiches baguettes, softer and very tasty when served hot.

Excited I finally got to try this place. It is a mix of Asian infused with american classics, burgers and fries! I have to admit I was a bit reluctant but was surprised every bite of the way.   I started with a pomegranite ginger soda. Awesome and refreshing! It was killer hot out that day so it was a perfect drink.   Then we moved on the the oxtail fries. Now I had read o. Yelp that they were a definite must. The pictures looked amazing so we couldn't go and not try it. Glad we did!   I had the roast duck bao sandwhiches. Another dish I ordered from a picture lol. It was definitely different but one of those pleasant surprises. The duck mixed with the sauce they serve on the side was delicious!!!  Also tried the poke and bone marrow jam. Poke was good, nice chunky portions of fish. The bone marrow is a unique dish, not really seen in many restaurants so my curiosity got the best of me. It had a strong flavor, one that you might need to get used to.   I will be back!

Pretty cool spot! My son loved the concept of being able to make his own pizza. Reminded me of a chipotle with the way it moves you down the line as you add more to your pizza.   They have a variety of sauces, cheeses, meats and toppings. You can definitely make an assortment of pizzas, flavors and creations. My son loved that he could put more parmesan on his mozzarella.  It is a laid back restaurant and the atmosphere matches. The service was also on point. If you have never been there it can be a buy overwhelming, the menu from the beginning can be an eye opener but once you get started they all help you along the way (in respect to ordering).  The pizza came out pretty quick and were really good. Only thing is the crust was super thin, not sure if they offer thicker crust. So if you don't love thin crust this may not be the spot for you.   If you are at downtown summerlin stop by!

Had to try the new filipino restaurant in the neighborhood. After reading the reviews (though not many) I was a bit reluctant bit I have to say I was quite surprised and pleased.  The food was very good. The sinigang was different from the typical sinigang I have had at home and in restaurants but a good different, a very good different. The portions are large and adequately priced.   The service was super friendly and inviting. I had read a couple reviews about the horrible service but I did not encounter that at all.  Its going to be a toss up between Cebu and DTs now since they are both next to my house.   But that sinigang...I will remember yummmmm!!

Had to see what all the hype was about this burger joint. Coming from NY I have to say nice touch at locating themselves within the NY NY hotel and casino. When we got there the line was out the door but even though to was a pretty long line it moved fairly quickly. They had someone manning the door and letting people in as the line inside started to go down. And once we got up to the counter every cash registered was being used and you could see all the people proactively working hard.  The cashier who took my order, Donna, could probably tell I had never been there. She was extremely helpful, friendly and even though there was a super long line behind me she was incredibly friendly and full of smiles. She helped me with my order and i have to admit she started off my experience quite well.   The food itself was pretty good. I tried the shroom burger and it was definitely full of mushrooms. The sauce they put on the burger is very tasty and adds to the burger. We also ordered the bacon burger and it had tons of bacon. They have so many different flavors of shakes. I got a strawberry and it was delicious!!! Not too thick but not too thin..just right.   Only thing that didn't make it a 5 star visit was that there was no place to sit (inside or outside). It was pretty busy so I'm sure that factored into it but trying to savor and enjoy your lunch while cramped up (half sitting/half standing) kinda takes away from the total experience. The way they are set up I guess doesn't really allow for any other way but maybe one day.

Heard of this place through a friend so decided to check it out. I love donuts!! Right when you walk in the smell takes you over. The donuts were wonderful. Even two days later the donuts were still soft and tasty.   They have a maple long john donut with a strip of bacon on top   Definitely try their custard filled donuts and old fashioned, so good!!

My cousin was in town and mentioned Jo Koys restaurant so clearly I got curious. Aside from being my favorite comedians place, they really did earn a 5 star.   Its a traditional shabu restaurant with all the seating being in a U shape so everyone is facing inward. So there really isn't a lot of seats but we arrived at just the right time because as soon as we were seated a line started to form and their wait began. When you walk in they all greet you with something, not sure what it was that they said but they did it for every customer so it was really cool to see all the attention each person got from the start.   Our server was incredibly friendly, she explained the way the menu works and helped with some suggestions. I got the spicy broth with a combination of the beef and chicken. I loved the broth! I got to say I drank it all after I ate all the meat. My son and I shared he wanted more, lol. The food is brought out quick and off we go to eating deliciousness!! The food overall was one of the best shabu I've had. They let you pick 2 sauces, I had the ponzu and another sweet one (forgot the name). The ponzu was my sons favorite while I enjoyed the sweet one a bit more.   To end our evening we tried the green tea chocolate fondue with strawberries and bananas. Omg! Get it! You must!

Love love love this place!! Talk about a beautiful salon with all the amenities for a perfect girl day or just girl time. The ladies there are super welcoming and friendly from the minute you literally walk in. The decor is gorgeous and the additional services they offer, aside from the normal Mani and pedi make it all a perfect package. Enjoy a cocktail (or nonalcoholic beverage) of your choice while they pamper your toes and hands.   I went with my ladies for our girls day and we had a blast. I don't do my nails often so I was bit reluctant since I'm not used to color on my nails but my lady picked out the perfect color!! Definitely a great start to my morning!!

Let me start by saying I'm not a huge curry fan but I'm never against trying something new. I got the chicken katsu curry spice 6. The meal was surprisingly pretty good. The meal consisted of rice (brown or white) the curry sauce and one piece of chicken. Considering the rice is a pretty big portion and the amount of sauce they give you takes up half the container, my only suggestion is they may want to consider serving more than just one piece of chicken. When all the chicken was gone I was pretty much just eating rice with sauce.   The spicy daikon is a nice touch to the meal as well.   Be careful when picking the spice because though it goes from 1-10, 5 & 6 is still pretty spicy. This coming from a girl who carries hot sauce in her bag, orders everything extra spice and loves to just casually munch on jalepenos.

Ahhhhhhh I was so excited to come here!!! We got there early around 8 and the store was busy..you could smell the donuts and yumminess!   I can't remember all the donuts we bought (yes we bought a lot) but I can tell you they were all extremely good. The cream filled donuts were not over filled and the donuts were so soft and moist. They had a strawberry creme donut that was topped with a fresh strawberry! A cookie donut with a real cookie on top and flavor of the day was a donut topped with mini m&ms drizzled with chocolate.   I can't wait to go back!!!!!

Ok, so one of my friends told me about this place and she didn't really have the best of things to say. However another friend of mine wanted to check it out so I said hey why not. We went for lunch and it wasn't really that busy so we were able to take our time to figure out what we wanted.   The concept of using waffles instead of buns is different and definitely something everyone should try. I was a bit worried the waffle would be too thick and filling but it was just the opposite. It was thin and airy so it was actually lighter than some used breads used for sandwiches and burgers. I had the California, had turkey slices, avocado, lettuce and this cheese spread. Other than the turkey slices being a bit dry, it was pretty good.   The service was good. The cashier also seemed to be serving as the runner and busser. Again wasn't too busy but kinda felt bad for her. She checked on us a few times which was nice to see if we needed anything.  I'm not sure I love the waffle sandwhich but I wouldn't be against going again.

Local spot to definitely check out. I had this place bookmarked and told myself whenever I make it to the east side I need to try this place out. Needless to say I made it to the east side, finally. Glad I did too. This place is very "family"ish. Super cute when you walk in, not like a chain establishment, very warm and welcoming. We were greeted right when we walked in, there isn't an actual hostess stand so it was nice since we weren't sure if we sat ourselves or not. They were pretty busy since we came during lunch but we were sat right away. Our server was extremely attentive and friendly.   Bacon jam, yes this is what drew me to this place. And O.M.G was it amazing! So delicious & tasty. I seriously couldn't get enough. Sinful tots! Try them!! You won't be disappointed!

So this used to be Sugar Factory and the look is still somewhat the same but with a different concept. Instead of candy it is focused more on chocolate, with a mini chocolate factory inside. The gelato is amazing, tons of flavors and really tasty. I love all the miscellaneous items in the store area that they sell.   The restaurant has a cute bar located inside and the main room has the same layout. The prices are a bit high for the type of food served. $20 for a turkey club was shocking and $24 for a tiny lobster sand which was even more crazy.  The lobster sandwich used to be a good size, this time it was more of an appetizer serving but served as a main lunch entree. $9 for fries with pulled pork and melted cheese on top and $7 for crisp bacon.    We sat outside because it was a beautiful day but quickly grew to regret it because the chairs were horribly uncomfortable.  It was like sitting in a chair with 5 sticks placed vertically to hold you.   The service wasn't too bad, our server took about 10 minutes to take our order but we were enjoying the company so we didn't mind too much. Only thing when we were paying she asked if we needed seperate checks we said yes. But when she brought it back it wasn't seperated out it was just put on one check seperated by seat numbers. I suppose it still achieves the same goal but why even ask if we want separate checks if your not going to actually bring separate checks.    The theme of the restaurant was difficult to actually understand. The ladies were wearing decorated lip tatoos, which were interesting but unclear as to how they mix into the motif. The chocolate factory was also a little random.   I am not sure I would return but who knows.

So my previous review may so what contradict this one however, second chance are not always a bad thing.  Dined here the other night for dinner and was quite surprised considering my first experience. Our server, Kevin, was the first pleasant experience. He was knowledgeable, friendly,attentive and very personable. His first recommendation for a cocktail was right on point. He listened to what I wanted and described a delicious drink which tastes just as great.   Our apps were the crab cakes and beef tartare. Crab cakes were wonderful while the beef tartare was thick and a bit chewy. For an entree, we enjoyed the lamb oso bucco. I am on a lamb kick at the moment so this entree looked quote appealing, on the side we had the oven roasted mushrooms.   Mushrooms  Lamb  Pleasantly satisfied with this delicious dinner!!

Great breakfast spot, especially if your craving steak and eggs! And...fresh juices!  I was a bit turned off because as we walked up and saw the mass amounts of people waiting and being told it would be a 30 min wait, my confusion grew as I saw a LOT of tables were  empty. The front of the restaurant actually looked completely empty, counted 12 tables empty.  Now I understand there are circumstances that arise where some tables will be empty but this wasn't some and to have so many people waiting to incur a 30 min wait...just seemed a bit off to me. Anyhow...  We were actually called at the 30 min mark so the hostesses got brownie points per se.  Now the overall experience was set by our server, Mara. Greeted our table in a timely manner, checked on us just the right amount of times, and on top of that recommended one of the best breakfast dishes I've ever had.  Bacon-and-egg in a hole French toast! Wow yumm!  Recommendation: watermelon strawberry juice, bacon and egg French toast

So I have to say this is a prime example of how each visit can be a hit or miss. Service is hardly ever as consistent as it should be and how service can really put a sour taste in a persons visit.   Brought my brother and sister in law to this spot while they were visiting and I was really disappointed I did. They were busy so granted the wait was inevitable, not a big deal but when we were called we followed our hostess half way as she POINTED to where our table was. The menus were already placed so she didn't have to hand them to us but she couldn't even walk us to our table yet stop half way then point us in the right direction. Uhh what the heck?!  Next, our server says hello and then repeatedly asks if we want water, a couple of us said yes while the others said no. Then as she's about to leave (after only taking our drink order) she asks again if we want water because apparently "its just a lot easier if I get you all water now rather than later" (verbatim). First, I wasn't aware getting a glass of water was so difficult. From that point on, the service was pretty downhill since we (as the customers) were super uncomfortable asking her for anything. Not that she checked on us to see how we were doing except at the end to drop the check.   The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the food was great and yet again saved this review.

This was a good find! Located inside the premium south outlets on LV blvd. They have a huge variety of dried fruits with different flavors. I love the chili papaya, spicy kick is a must.  You can try all the fruits too before making a final decision. Try the banana BBQ chips, YUM!  The lady who helped us was super friendly, excited to help and really knew the products!   Check them out

When I saw this was opening up by my house I was super excited. I couldn't wait, we actually went once and it wasn't open yet, bummer.   So we finally got a chance to try it. I ordered the firecracker chicken bowl. Do you love spice? Well I do and this definitely hit the spot! There is a lot on the menu so I had to ask and the guy recommended it. He even asked if I wanted it medium or hot..I said hot!!! It came with brown rice, veggies and really good chicken tossed in spicy, sweet chili sauce. Only suggestion is maybe to put the sauce on the veggies too, they were a bit bland compared to the entire meal but still yum!!!My son tried the Korean steak bowl and I am assuming he loved it because he ate it all up without me having to tell him to finish it. Haha!   The service was good too, the guy welcomed us and helped us along with our order since it was our first time.

Gotta admit these macarons were really good. I've been trying out different bakeries and macaron shops and these are by far the best. Not surprising since they are from NY.   Its a small little stand outside VS on the bottom floor of the mall, can't miss it. Its in the middle of all the hustle and bustle. Pretty good location if you ask me.   So they had a marshmallow macaroni, different! Had to try it and was super happy I did! Yummmmmmmy! They had a few different flavors as well. They are a bit on the pricey side, but if you love macarons I'd suggest this spot.

Super happy to have a ramen house next to my house!!!!! Driving to spring mountain wasn't always so fun. The decor upon entering was eye pleasing. Traditional in a more modern tone. Cute!  The service honestly "on point" comes to mind. The minute we entered to the second we left our server was super attentive and extremely friendly. She suggested some great appetizers along with an entree that hit spot. We tried the karaage and shishito peppers as an app, then I had the spicy ramen. All delicious!!  The ramen was pretty spicy but I LOVE spicy!! So it was perfect.  I'll be back especially when winter arrives!!!

Check out this spot! From the service, theme, food, drinks and culture this is a must visit.   We arrived and were told it was going to be about 30 min but were sat in about 15. The hostess was friendly and even though she was talking to someone she was able to still look at us, smile and let us know she would be with us in a minute. Simple acknowledgement goes a very long way!  The menus were like black notebooks which immediately caught my eye and the beer list was typed on notebook paper. Very original.  Started with a vanilla, blueberry canned beer called the big blue van and surprisingly it was really good! They specialize in a lot of crafted beers so if you like beer I recommend this spot. Next we had the tuna nicoise salad and then the short ribs. The food was prompt and very good.   Service was 5 stars. Even though we had one server many others touched out table to make sure we were ok or to check if we needed anything. I will be back for sure!  Side note: cool spot for group gatherings that have a oudoor patio area with its own bar AND.... A beer pong table!!! Lol

Let me start by saying im not a big meat person but i have always wanted to try this place. All you can eat meats, who wouldn't. The variety of meats they offer varies from pork, steaks, chicken and lamb.   We were able to experience so many types of meats, cuts and flavors. The filet mignon was extremely tender, lamb chops with mint sauce full of flavor, bacon wrapped chicken definite delight, pork sausage cooked just right and the variety of extra sides at the salad bar was an overload of goodness.   Our server Amanda was amazing as well. She was attentive, personable and when we requested a certain meat she was quick to have it sent to our table. She was so polite, for instance she would ask permission to pour more sangria instead of just assuming we wanted more. She also used a splashguard while pouring. Now I know that's a standard in most restaurants but not followed all the time. Her recommendations were well taken.  Favorites: lamb chops, shrimp salad and filet.

So happy to have a crepe place by the house! Crepes, tea and boba all mean a frequent stopping place for our family.   The service is really wonderful here, very friendly, welcoming and attentive. My son and I stopped in one day while waiting to get his haircut and enjoyed some boba almond milk and a nutella crepe. My son is always wanting to stop here so this was a treat for him.   They do have a limited crepe menu so I can't wait till they expand their crepe menu. They are fresh and delicious.   We will be back!

Yummmmm! So the idea is like chipotle but hawaiian. Pick a bowl, burrito, tacos or nachos. Then you have a variety of rices, meats, sides, salsas and award winning guacamole to top it off.   Huli hula chicken, kalua pig....mango salsa, seaweed rice..and for dessert coconut bark! O.M.G!!!  So I had a chicken bowl with cabbage, hot tomato salsa, seaweed rice and guacamole with jalapeños. Amazing!!  The employees are awesome too. So friendly and fun!!!

Thank you Yelp for helping me find a donut spot by my house! Been trying to visit this place for sometime but I have a hard time since they close early. I know best time to go is early in the morning so they have a lot of variety and it's fresh. Luckily I was able to stop by one morning. So happy I did too!!  I had to get one of each donut it was a must! My ultimate favorite is the cookies and cream donut. OMG!!! So good!!!!! Its crumbled cookie topping is soft , the donut itself is super moist.  We tried the fruity pebble donut and even the next day it was still moist. I love that since we can't eat every donut in one day, it's good to know u can eat it still the next day.  Got a couple cream filled donuts and I must say the Bavarian cream wasn't overloaded and it wasn't too sweet. Usually donuts are so overloaded the minute you take a bite its oozing out and you either get it all over the place or you have to hurry up and eat it. Not with these donuts. I also like that they don't fill it until you actually purchase it. Fresh!!! Loved the red velvet cake donut as well, if you like red velvet you must try this one as well. Maple and bacon...I don't think I need to say anymore LOL!  Only donut we didn't love was the green tea pistachio donut. Maybe this is an acquired taste?!?   I'll be back!

Now I know what all the hype is about.  Clearly a sushi burrito grabbed my attention. Why wouldn't it?!!??   First off I was confused by the name some since on yelp and other patrons told me it was called something else, but after I cleared up the confusion I finally found it. The place was a little hard to find because of all the construction, but I'm sure it's only temporary.   The place is like chipotle. You pick burrito, bowl, nachos, etc....then on top you're choice of protein. New thing for me was a vurrito wrapped in seaweed. They do have a wide selection of sushi and sauces that was fun. You get to add your choice of sauce, vegetables and salsas at the end. Interesting to say the least.   I tried the yellowtail and spicy tuna with the ponzu sauce. The burrito is a tad on the slim side but overall not bad. I am a bit interested in the other sushis they have, so I'll be back.   Service was par, we did arrive at a busy time so maybe that was a played a factor in it. Nonetheless, really cool concept! Check it out

First timer! We went during lunch and it was super busy but even though the line was really long it went by pretty fast. Once we got to the front of the line we were greeted by an energetic, friendly man who explained how things worked and took our salad and sandwich order.  If you haven't been here before its very similar to paradise bakery. You order your salad and/or sandwhich first then move down the line to the soups. The service itself was fast and friendly. At the end all your food is on the tray and you are met with these delicous looking home made brulees. OMG! Its hard to resist.  We tried the California chicken sandwich, lobster bisque , turkey avocado sandwhich and Maui tropical salad.   Loved the salad...so refreshing and delicious. 5   The lobster bisque was a little of a disappointment. I was expecting a creamy, lobster pieced filled soup like I have had at other restaurants. This one was more like mass produced, a bit watery based, no lobster soup. I get it that they probably go through gallons of this soup and they can't have people chopping up fresh lobster in the back so maybe u expectations were a little too high.   I'll go back to try the rest of the food..there are tons of choices.

New burger spot and by our house, score! Had heard good things about this place so of course I got curious.   First thing I noticed was they served a lot more than just burgers so I was excited about that. They serve breakfast as well as a variety of salads (which looked huge) and sandwiches, in addition to their burgers.   I optes to try the turkey melt, which was by far the best I have ever had. It wasn't oily or greasy like some places I've had it at. The onion rings...all I have to say is the onions they use are not average onions. The rings were gigantic. They only serve a few peices but it's by far plenty to fill a person up.   I'd like to go back and try more items.

Gotta say, this place sure does have a great idea.   Cereal ice cream!?? Cinnamon toast crunch ice cream, seriously!!! Amazing! What's any better than that...I'll tell u put in between fruity pebble macaroons! Yup a delicious ice cream cookie sandwhich.  So I had seen a bunch of posts about this place so clearly I needed to see what all the hype was about. I was actually pretty impressed with the ideas behinds the ice cream flavors. I had never seen ice cream flavor a derived from popular kid cereals. Cinnamon toast crunch, fruit loops and cap n crunch. Pretty Smart! They also had some other delicious flavors, I personally liked the white chocolate raspberry and mangoneada.   They are popular for their ice cream cookie/macaroon sandwhiches which they top off with a fire roasted marshmallow. They have a variety of macaroons that are made specifically for them.   The location was a bit hard to find since it is tucked away and not easily visible from the street. Unfortunately after speaking with one of the owners they are not really permitted many options as far as signage by the city because of the direction the store entrance faces and rarity of their actual retail spot. This can make it a bit difficult for some patrons but they are close to a park which will make them a popular summer spot once they get their name out more.   Definitely check them out!
