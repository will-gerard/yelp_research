My first visit and first impression of this place is great! I felt welcomed and really enjoyed my restorative yoga class. They seem offer a wide variety of classes for all levels and as other reviews stated, there are no intimidating mirrors or loud music.  After spending some time in India,  I have a hard time attending "Western Yoga" classes, I felt a true sense of real yoga principals here.  I've been looking for a new yoga studio and I think I may have found it!

I really have to refrain from not going here more than once a week since it's right down the street from house! Huge portions that are sure to provide a full meal of leftovers for the next day. Their chips and guac are served with a giant amount of guacamole.  Cheese enchilads are the best! Fast drive through service too! Yummy yummy yummy!

GREAT experience buying our used Prius! No haggling, no tricks, no holding on to your license, etc. Great price for our trade in and wonderful, QUICK process! I would recommend to anyone looking to buy a car! Left feeling good about our purchase!

Soooo not impressed. Heard there were bargains here, guess I missed that section. Store unorganized, felt like I was digging around at last chance. Employees were scare and those that did make an appearance seemed less than thrilled to be here let alone provide any assistance.  Don't plan on coming back that's for sure!

Super impressed with this place! I needed a second opinion on a belt repair and choose to give Shadow Mountain a try based on their great yelp reviews.  They lived up to their 5 stars!  I felt they were honest and genuine. They didn't talk down to me or try to up sell me on needless things like many places do.  I even got a ride to work while they completed the repair!  This is now my "place" for repairs and oil changes. :)

Guuuuud! Great transition back into Indian food after suffering some Delhi belly on my recent trip to India.  The buffet had a great variety of vegetarian selections and a good array of authentic desserts.  Nan was fresh and warm and very good. I can't wait to go back again!

I never trusted anyone to give me a psychic reading before. Bob's friendliness and sense of humor made me feel good about it.  He was really spot on with many situations and continued to keep that track record in subsequent readings. I would highly recommend Bob!
