A great find in the neighborhood. The deluxe(turkey, ham, roast beef) & the turkey-ham on a wheat roll was filling and delicious!  We will be going back.

We stopped in for breakfast, and had the chicken fried steak.  The menu had a lot to choose from and the restaurant was spacious.  Parking is readily available.  A good family restaurant.  The service was quick.

Burger & fries! Enjoy all the time.  We stop by every time we're visiting Arizona since we don't have one in New Mexico.  The sauce on their burgers are delicious.
