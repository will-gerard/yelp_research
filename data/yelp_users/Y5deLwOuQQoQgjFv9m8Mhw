Been coming here since 2008. This place never disappoints. Great healthy choices everyday all day. Check out my Daybreaker egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms in the pic :) Delicious!

It was such a treat to be out here after a couple of days of rain in AZ. The dessert was in bloom and there is absolutely nothing like running dessert trails in the beautiful state of Arizona.   Because of time constraints, we opted to loop around Treasure trail for a short run/hike. I was really sorry not to have brought a real camera. It was so beautiful out there. Like any other state farms, I would not go on a weekend to enjoy the park more.

We ordered ours to go and they missed one order of sashimi plate and there was no wasabi in any of the other entrees/rolls we ordered :( Now who forgets wasabi???   Fish was fresh though and sushi rolls were delicious. We got spicy tuna, spicy crab, and some California rolls in addition to entrees.

This peak is pretty steep but fun to climb. Parking is a challenge especially on the weekends.  Please don't leave your trash in the park. This was the first park I've been to with the most number of water bottles lying around.

We got our reservation through Hotwire. They were the best in value giving us a mid-size SUV for 7 days for $293 with unlimited miles. Since they didn't have the mid-sized SUV when we got there, they upgraded us for free to a Chevy Suburban. The SUV was very clean, had a in-dash GPS, satellite radio, and a lot of room for two people. The desk personnel handling our rental were very courteous and friendly. No delay in getting our car.   I would rent from these guys again.

When a family member suggested this place to meet for lunch, I was almost afraid to come after reading horrible reviews. I believe that those lowly reviews were given a little too prematurely considering the place just opened.   When we arrived, we were pleasantly greeted by staff. I got a green goddess salad and a gardener juice. The veggies were freshly cut and tasted robust. My husband ordered the lobster cobb salad that he enjoyed. His daughters got the chestnut chopped salad that tasted delicious. All our salads just had the right amount of dressing allowing you to taste the freshness of the organic ingredients.  Seating is quite limited inside but they do have several tables at their patio area. They also have a flower shop in the restaurant. Before we left we ordered chocolate chip cookies to go after hearing how good they were. They were not greasy and a great munchy ;) please check my photos for ingredients of our salads. You will want to try their food out after viewing them. Give them a chance. These little places serving healthy meals are quite beneficial to the community and bad reviews could cause a loss in business that not only hurt business owners but employees as well. Please check them out yourselves before forming an opinion although I would stay away from anything with the English muffin that had been consistently bashed.   Here's a link to their menu:  http://chestnutaz.com/ChestnutMenu.pdf
