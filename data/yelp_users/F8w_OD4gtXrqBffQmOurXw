I can hardly believe how highly rated this restaurant/wine bar is. I have been twice and both times was treated to high prices, poor and condescending service and mediocre food.  Once I ordered a veggie plate specifically because the menu stated that it included haricot verts. When the plate came they were not on it. I questioned the server and she said they were "out of season", but had not bothered to tell me in advance that the menu item would not be as described.   Against my better judgment I went back a second time with a wine tasting group. Some political thing was to take place in the restaurant hours later. It was being set up for so we were shunted to some tables we didn't want, service was abysmal and the food and wine were really overpriced for what we received.   I will never go back.

Ok, to be fair, I am that rarest of breeds: a vegetarian foodie.   I realize that gives me a lot more challenges at many restaurants, but I have to say I was really disappointed with the food at Tarbell's. I had read all the reviews about how he was an Iron Chef competitor, etc, so perhaps I was expecting too much.  We dined very early, so there was no issue with parking or crowding in the restaurant as many other reviewers had mentioned. We were seated immediately. Server was pleasant and informative as well as prompt. I have no issue at all with the service. In fact it was quite exceptional. It was the food which disappointed.  I asked the server about vegetarian options. There was a seasonal vegetable mixture on the menu and the server convinced me that was the way to go. We discussed a few other options, but I went with his recommendation. When it came to the table the presentation was "interesting" but not especially appetizing.   The flavor wasn't disgusting but certainly not great. I ate about a quarter of it. The server asked if I disliked it. I told him it was edible but not great. He instantly offered to replace it with something else. Points to him. I declined a replacement because there really wasn't anything else vegetarian-without-alteration on the menu that evening. I declined having him take the item off the bill as I did eat part of it. Without being asked the server informed me later that he had taken my entree off the bill.   I forget what we had for dessert. That's a bad thing. Dessert should be memorable.   All in all the bread was really good, the rest of the food was only ok, the service was great, ambiance was ok and the price was WAY too high for what we received, even with my $22 veggie-pile entree removed from the bill. I'm not a cheapskate and I am no stranger to a $200 dinner, but it better be a darn good experience for that. Sadly it wasn't. Dinner companion and I will not be returning.

Let me begin by saying I *love* Middle Eastern food. I have tried many restaurants is search of great examples of this cuisine. Flaming Kabob serves excellent food from a family owned, local restaurant.   This restaurant offers friendly, knowledgeable service and help navigating the menu. There was a lot of selection available for vegetarians including hummus, tabouli, stuffed grape leaves, moujadara, falafel, spanikopita and more. Of course lots of choices for the carnivores too.  We started with an appetizer of flaming cheese served with warm pita bread which was decadent and delicious. For my entree I tried the vegetable gayalla, a sort of stir fry of onion, green and orange peppers, mushrooms and carrots in a butter-garlic sauce. It came with a choice of two sides. I chose the lentil soup and the rice as my sides. Other sides included Greek salad and french fries.  The lentil soup was good but not exceptional.   The rice was a moist and flavorful outstanding pilaf with golden raisins and slivered almonds. The gayalla was totally scrumptious. My dining companion, who is a meat eater, wished that she had ordered the same entree. I had been tempted to try several other items on the menu, but they were all items I had tasted before at other restaurants. I was very, very happy that I tried the new (to me) dish.   Service is not speedy because everything is made fresh, but it's worth the wait. Drinks were refilled and servers checked on us frequently  As other reviewers have noted, the ambiance is a tad strange since the restaurant is housed in an old "5th & Diner" building, and still has the original diner booths and long counter, but with the addition of some hookahs. All I can say is: get over it and enjoy the food. Flaming Kabob is not at all close to my house, but next time I am in the area I will definitely return.

I visited Cafe Istanbul for dinner on a Wednesday evening. The weather was nice so we sat out on the patio. Just a view of the parking lot, but outside is good weather is always better in my opinion and the metal chairs were comfortable enough with cushions.   Friend and I ordered and shared a variety of appetizers and they were all very tasty. I had moujadara, lubieh bezeyt, garlic dip, Haloumi cheese pie, and fresh mozzarella with tomato (sort of a middle eastern caprese salad). The spicing on the lubieh was excellent. The garlic dip was pungent...just the way I like it. My friend had the chicken shawarma with rice pilaf and salad. The rice was flavorful and she said the shawarma was excellent.   Service was spotty but not terrible. Portion size was decent, pita bread was fresh and warm, Turkish coffee was well done. I love middle eastern food (must have been Lebanese in a former life)  and this is the best place I have tried in a while. All in all I can't wait to go back and try a few more things like hummus and falafel and babaganouj.

Last night was my first visit to La Calabria and it was a delightful experience from beginning to end.   I was seated promptly and my drink order taken while waiting for my dining companion. I got a nice, reasonably priced, glass of Nero D'aviloa, and Italian bread and olive oil flavored with a chiffonade of fresh basil and some chopped sun dried tomato for drizzling. The basil was a nice, fresh touch.  Our knowledgeable server answered menu questions and took us through the extensive list of daily specials. I ended up with a gnochi, which was a plate full of potato pillows of cheesy heaven in a tomato vodka sauce. It was served with a salad with a house balsamic dressing which was well balanced and delicious.   My companion also had one of the daily special dishes, chicken picata, served with roasted potatoes and broccoli rabe. She said it was delicious.  Pacing throughout the meal was unrushed and good. My questions regarding the vegetarian-or-not properties of the meal were handled graciously.   Ambiance was unremarkable but nice enough for a strip-mall restaurant.   I would definitely recommend this little hidden gem to anyone. I will be back.

I agree with another reviewer who wished she could write two reviews for this place, but over all I love it. Just don't try it on a Friday or Saturday night unless you're under 30. Too crowded; too loud; too many pheromones, but on to the positive.  This place has a helpful and knowledgeable staff, a very decent wine list and a respectable beer list. I can't believe the generosity of happy hour which goes from 11am to 6pm. That's a dang long happy hour! $5 glasses of wine and $2.50 draft beers including my personal fave Kiltlifter. Those are great prices.   This great spot is under the same ownership as The Sushi Room next door, and if you ask nicely they will bring you a sushi roll while you have your happy hour beverage. That is "above-and-beyond" service in my book. Most of the waitstaff is quite young and of the short-shorts and low cut top variety, but personable even to old gals like me and the service (other than F&S nights) is great.   The menu choices are not extensive, but they are good. Excellent salads, soups and sandwiches. The Caprese sandwich is spectacular as is the Caprese appetizer. Fresh and delish.   Sitting outside in the afternoon on the covered patio areas is a treat. Bring a book, sip a glass, have a nosh. Life is good in the Living Room.

I was really disappointed in this place. I went for music with friends and the venue was new to me.   The set up in the long, narrow bar is bizarre, with high-top tables up close to the stage blocking the view of everyone at the low tables behind. The noise level was ridiculously high, with lots of TVs playing sports competing with the music. The acoustics were also very strange.  The service was atrocious. I waited 10 minutes to even catch the eye of a waitress. She immediately told me they were out of chips and salsa. This is a Mexican restaurant for heaven sake! How can you run out of chips and salsa.   Once I ordered my tableside guacamole it took over an hour to get it, and once it came it was unmemorable, bland with a couple of unexpected spots of fiery chili. My fellow music lovers had similar experiences with the service and food.  I hate to say it, because I love to support venues that feature live music, but I will not be back to this restaurant.

Very bad experience at Uncle Bear's last night.   I asked for water no lemon. Water came with lemon. I asked for a Kiltlifter beer. Wrong beer came. Sent back. Dining companion asked 3 times for no tomato on salad. Guess what. Salad came with tomato. Sent back. No refills were brought for drinks. We were never asked if we wanted dessert. Took a long time to get check.  We were there almost two hours for a "quick" dinner.  Once it finally got there the food was ok.   I don't know how much of this problem was fault of the kitchen, but certainly the server was clueless. I don't expect service this bad on a Tuesday night. I'll be going to Oreganos next door next time. The food is better there.

This was my second visit to the HSG. The first time I went for Blues In The Barn. The entertainment was my favorite local bluesman, Paris James. The barn was very cold and the servers insisted on leaving the doors open. Service was slow and the menu was limited, not the same as in the main restaurant. But the entertainment was wonderful.  When a friend suggested going for dinner I was interested to try some items from the full menu. I arrived early, not knowing how bad the traffic would be. It was 15 minutes before the restaurant opening time. The door was unlocked so I went inside, stated that I realized I was early, but would it be ok to just get a glass of wine and hang out until my dinner companion arrived. I was told "no" in no uncertain terms, so I went back outside to wait. Strike 1.  When my friend arrived she asked for a cocktail not on the menu and was told that they didn't know how to make it and wouldn't guarantee it would be any good, Strike 2.   As an appetizer we had the polenta fries, which were crispy and tasty with a zesty chile aoli.  For my entree I had the veggie trio. The presentation was beautiful. The portions were miniscule. For $16 I got 4 small slices of beets, a tiny tasting cup of delicious soup with toasted hazelnuts on top, and one arancini (fried risotto ball) with a tiny carafe of tomato sauce. The arancini was yummy and crisp on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. The beets were also flavorful.   In spite of having only three filled tables, service by two waiters and a wine steward was snail-like all through the meal, becoming surly when we asked for a coffee and a hot tea after dinner. We were never offered water, coffee or tea refills. Strike 3.   All in all, I will not be going back to HSG. I enjoyed the food, but the surly, slow service coupled with the expensive menu items make this spot a poor value in spite of the lovely old house and charming patio in which the restaurant is situated.

I am amazed and confused by the 5 star ratings by most reviewers of this coffeehouse. My first visit to SoZo Coffeehouse was a grave disappointment. I think they mean well, but the execution was quite flawed.   The menu board is cryptic at best, with no explanations or prices, so you have to waste everyone's time asking for explanations. At least the young woman who waited on me was very friendly and didn't seem to mind explaining the menu. Co-chata (a latte made with horchata instead of milk) sounded interesting, but I chickened out and ordered a small latte. It was not especially hot, and the flavor was mediocre at best. I'm not sure where they source their beans, but the final product was weak and did not have a good roasted flavor.  Some friends had heard that there would be live music at SoZo on Monday night. I love live music and was thrilled to hear that this local business supports it. Friends were told it was a national act, so we decided to check it out. The music started half an hour late (not uncommon with live performances I know, but still annoying). The band, such as it was, (normally 5 members, but only one regular and a substitute showed up) was definitely aimed at a younger crowd than my friends and I. Very screamy with uninspired guitar playing, but the lead guy sure could stomp his foot. We left as soon as we thought we could without being rude. I threw away over half my latte on the way out.  The place is quite large for a coffeehouse, however the ambiance was not inviting, comfortable or cozy, in my opinion.  I realize everyone's taste in music and coffee is different, but I thought both the music and the coffee left so much to be desired that I won't be going back. And, by the way, my two companions felt the same way.

Very nice place for a low-key birthday celebration. Per some of the other reviews here on Yelp the place is girl-heaven. Plants, dark wood, comfy booths and tables. Your eyes and taste buds are tantalized by delicious-looking baked goods on display just inside the door.   There were some excellent choices on the wine list, including Klinker Brick Cab. Mmmm.   Many of the menu choices sounded good. Plenty of salads, sandwiches and other tasty sounding entrees. I had a tart of caramelized leeks, mushrooms and spinach. The pastry was flaky and the filling was fresh and flavorful. On the plate was an assorted greens salad with a very tasty lime vinaigrette.   It wasn't super-cheap, but not outrageous either. Lunch with two good glasses of wine, two entrees and a "baby cake" to celebrate my big day. The total tab came to around $60.  My friend and I intend to go back when the weather is cooler and enjoy the charming greenery-filled patio.

House of brews is a great locally owned, non-chain, neighborhood bar with pleasant servers and a wide selection of good, cold beers, local, national and international brands. They book a lot of great (for my taste) local, live bands on the weekends.   It has a variety of comfortable seating: bar, booths and high tops.   What more can you ask from a bar? It has become one of my main weekend music hangouts.

Hate the noisy fast food atmosphere and decor. That being said the veggie burger was fresh and excellent. Cucumber slices gave an unexpected crunch. Honey mustard dressing was yummy. Additional cheese and avocado put this burger over the top.   Pleasant staff.    If you don't mind standing in line to order then picking up your food you'll probably like this place.

A very new restaurant arrived in South Chandler/Ocotillo area near my home in the space formerly housing Sautee Restaurant.   A friend and I went for lunch today. The decor is modern and fun without being cold. A nice outdoor patio with a really cool fireplace is a great feature for cool evenings. Booths were comfortable and a variety of other seating options were offered including high tops.   All the tableware is unique and attractive. Looks like the water glasses are sourced locally from DiSciacca in Chandler, but that's a guess.   Focaccia bread and water were brought to the table quickly with a delicious, herb-y compound butter.  We shared a wine poached pear rocket salad with candied pecans and fried feta. Yum! Dressing was the perfect tang to compliment along with a very decent glass of Petite Sirah. The wine list was interesting if not large. Tastes were available before purchase.  We also shared a brie and blackberry flatbread which was topped with the same rocket salad greens with balsamic dressing. I think this menu item was just ok. The greens didn't really add to the flatbread with that particular combination of ingredients. I will try their garden flatbread next time.  We also shared a dessert which was a cheesecake duo; one side was mandarin orange flavored and the other side was plain served in a bed of raspberry creme. The orange side was dense but still moist and the orange flavor was delightful. The other side was just dense and rather dry. Coffee was adequately strong and hot.   From their Chamber of Commerce entry: "Table 49 is a contemporary American restaurant on the cutting edge of ethnic cuisine fusion. Our menu is comprised of a vast array of modern style techniques and flavors resulting in one of a kind signature dishes that are sure to impress. Table 49 is beautifully designed around soft lighting, large leather booths, and a spectacular bar that encompass our family style Chefs table. Perfect for any occasion, Table 49 is your destination for comfort and style."  We will definitely give this place another try.

Just visited this place for the first time. I am happy to say that I agree with the 4.5 star rating. I gave it 5 stars, but if there were a 4.5 option I would do that only because the decor is uninspired. However, they got all the really important things right.   Pleasant greeting, comfortable booths, decent wine list, nice selection of intriguing craft beers on draft, a pretty decent happy hour menu, beautiful presentation, local sourcing, and excellent flavors. I will come back to try some specialty cocktails after reading the glowing reviews of their bar service.  I was going to post a photo of the baked goat cheese crepe which is gorgeous and delectable, but I see someone else posted that photo. Dining companion had the Margharita pizza which she enjoyed.  I highly recommend this place. Let's make sure they get enough business to survive this iffy location.

The Women Who Wine visited Salut Kitchen Bar yesterday. We had a lovely experience from start to finish.   Sunday's special is half-priced bottles, so the 6 of us shared a couple of bottles of one of my favorite Lodi, CA, Zinfandels, Klinker Brick, which is not all that common in wine bars.   Our server, Chris, an adorable cutie from Cypress, was attentive and helpful, even arranging for an extra portion of their signature appetizer, the hummus nachos. The nachos come in 5 portions, and there were six of us, so Chris went back to the kitchen and got us the extra at no charge. The appetizer was delicious too, with tasty hummus on toasty pita bread with pomegranate seeds, and some yummy balsamic reduction drizzle.  The prices were very reasonable, and for 6 of us sharing 3 bottles of wine, a very nice cheese platter and two of the Hummus Nachos, with a 20% tip cost us a mere $23 each.   The place is not far from ASU, and is obviously aimed at a younger crowd, but the manager was accommodating enough to turn down the music upon request. My only complaint would be the un-cushioned metal chairs, which were not all that comfortable for older lady bottoms and backs.   I will definitely go back.

I really love this place. The food is fresh, creative and excellent. I love the Smokey TLT with avocado. The tempe 'bacon' is made on premises and is crunchy and delicious. There are also wraps, plates, bakery items and more.  Their juices are interesting combinations of fruit and veggies that are delicious and filling.   The owner, Sasha, came to our table to greet us and insure all was well. Very nice lady who is dedicated to healthy eating and quality organic ingredients.   Great place for vegetarians, vegans, raw foodists, gluten intolerants and many others with dietary restrictions or preferences, and it tastes good for "regular" folks too.   The only two downsides are probably unavoidable. Number one, it is rather noisy with the blenders going to make the juices and smoothies, and no soft surfaces on the floors or walls to absorb the sound. The other is the price. This is not a cheap place to go, but you get what you pay for and I believe the value is there.  Best to luck to 24 Carrots in its new location!

I have known Dave for somewhere around 20 years. He has helped me purchase 3 cars and sell 3. He is one of the most honest and caring people I know, and holds himself to a very high ethical standard.   He has cultivated a group of service providers who are trustworthy for any auto service and repair needs you may have and will take care of your vehicle sales and purchases in every way. He has even helped me with car issues with a car I am not selling.  I have frequently and unreservedly recommended Dave to numerous friends for both sale and purchase of vehicles.   He always goes above and beyond to help his clients. I am so happy to have met him years ago. Since my husband passed away over 9 years ago, Dave has been my go-to car guy. I sincerely appreciate all his help, knowledge and experience.   He recently helped me sell my 2002 Toyota Highlander for top dollar, and purchase a Toyota Avalon for over $7,000 below sticker price.   If you need help buying or selling a car, Dave can save you time and money. Give him a call!
