Serrano's is one of those Mexican chains that just does it right. While it is slightly dirty and the staff can sometimes be lacking, their food more than makes up for it. It tends to be slightly on the spicy side so make sure you are prepared for that before ordering. I personally like this location over some of the others in the area too because they are more consistent with their food.   I sincerely miss being in AZ because of Serrano's!

I like shirts and I like things so it seems to make sense that I would enjoy this store. It is kind of a genre store with much of the merchandise being focused on the punk rock/alt rock lifestyle.   There are band tees a plenty and patches and belt buckles you'd be hard-pressed to find outside of those walls. I love window-shopping here and while much of it isn't stuff I'd wear, I can't help but admire the amount of stuff they have. I have purchased a few belt buckles and t-shirts that I couldn't find anywhere else when I stopped by randomly.  Some people might be quick to label it as a mom-and-pop Hot Topic but I don't think that does it justice. This place is more authentic and has much more interesting stuff for those who don't want to feel out of place with rock and roll tweens.

Golden Canyon is one of my favorite Asian restaurants in Arizona. When I lived in this area a few years ago, their dinner specials were often a guilty pleasure for my far too frequently. I have only eaten in once or twice but the take-out was always extremely delicious and steaming hot! The amount of food you get for the money is almost criminal.  At the time when I was frequenting Golden Canyon most often we would see the owners often enough that she always spent time chatting with us and made the extra effort to learn our names and get to know us. I even invited her to my wedding! This is the type of business owner that communities need!   Beyond that though, the food is consistently great and I have never had a terrible experience. It's not exactly fine dining but it is mouth-wateringly good Chinese food on a very small budget.

Schlotsky's is a refreshingly original take on the sandwich. Unlike most of the other sandwich shops (Subway, Quiznos), Schlotsky's is both more delicious and much more expensive. It is also completely different. I recommend the Turkey & Guac.

Simply one of the best antique malls I've visited. It is a MASSIVE 2-story shop and has a little bit of everything. There is a lot of junk but also a ton of treasures so don't be afraid to do some digging. The staff aren't experts in the field so you don't have to worry about getting bent over on prices (this also means that they aren't extremely knowledgeable though either, so you'll be on your own).  I highly recommend this place!

This is quite frankly one of the most disgusting chinese buffets I have visited. The food had nothing redeeming about it and was very cold. It was also extremely limited on selection. I am not extremely picky with chinese buffet - I'm a huge fan of even the mediocre ones- but this place is worse than bad. I would avoid it at all costs.

I want to give a disclaimer that I never actually got to stay at the hotel but I think most people will agree that my experience should be documented with a short review.   I booked a room at the Best Western Inn of Chandler nearly 1 month ago and paid in full upfront in order to get a low room rate. Today I was informed (just 2 days before my trip) that my reservation would not be honored as they were "overbooked" and they tried to divert my reservation to a much inferior motel nearby (with no offer of discount or anything). Their claim that they are overbooked is laughable as you can find available rooms for the dates I was staying at pretty much any travel site on the internet including their own site. My assumption is that they didn't want to honor the rate that I paid.   I demanded a full refund and will be staying at another hotel in the area. I wouldn't waste my time with this hotel in the future even if their rates are low because obviously they don't feel obligated to honor them.

Okay, as other people have mentioned, it's not a great place to SELL clothes, but it is awesome if you are in the market for buying some high end used goods. You can find pretty much any high end brand here that is slightly used.   Over the years I have seen a bit less high quality items and the prices have gone up a bit but I still love going here because there is always a gem or two to find. If you want high end jeans for a great price or an awesome new shirt, check it out.

My family ended up in this area and since I had seen a rave review for Deluca's on Man vs Food, we decided to hit it up. Let me preface this by stating that I'm a breakfast man. It is my favorite meal of the day so I get excited when I find a place that does it right.... unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed.   But, to be fair, I wasn't terribly disappointed either. I ordered chocolate chip and strawberry pancakes with whipped cream on them, scrambled eggs, and sweet sausage. My wife got that massive veggie and egg plate that they showed on MvF (I can't recall what it was). Both were acceptable, but underwhelming. My wife makes better pancakes and eggs, and the plate she ordered tasted under-seasoned.   It wasn't terribly expensive so I didn't feel that it was a total waste, but surely didn't think it was worthy of its claim of "Best Breakfast in Pittsburg". I also felt that the inconvenience of cash-only would make it not worth a return visit.  Also, the dining room is definitely not built for comfort. The tables were packed in so tight that we literally had to climb through another booth to get to our table and the benches were incredibly uncomfortable.

Quite frankly, there isn't a better breakfast in America (don't tell my wife). Although TC Eggintons is a bit expensive and always crowded, the breakfast food is second to none.  I am personally a fan of the french toast but pretty much everything on the menu is divine.   Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I would start it off here.

This is one of the best mexican restaurants in the valley. Although it isn't exactly authentic flavors, the food is delicious and cheap. I especially like their mango salsa tacos (I can't remember what they're called).  The chips and salsa come free here and are excellent. The green salsa and beans are especially good although they charge for extra beans.  This is a great place for smaller groups but large groups will want to stay away because it is a small restaurant and you'll end up waiting forever to be seated.

Bookmans is the Mecca of Bookstores. Seriously, there isn't a better bookstore anywhere that I've lived. All of the people who complain that Bookmans didn't buy their stuff obviously don't understand the concept of a place like this - if they need it, they buy it. Obviously if they have 52 copies of 'The Time Traveller's Wife', they aren't going to buy yours.  I honestly love everything about Bookmans! True, it is slightly dingy, but that is part of the charm. You can buy pretty much any book you could dream of for 1/3 the price you would at Barnes & Noble or any other bookstore.   But, book aren't the end of what they sell. Magazine, Movies, Music, Games, Video Game Systems, Art.... pretty much anything used that is in good condition and someone else might want, they carry.   Bookmans is a personal obsession! I would peruse every day if I still lived there.  I also think that their purchasing system is more than fair. I have gone many times and sold old books or video games that I was done with and have felt the credit/cash they gave me was acceptable. There have also been times that I took bags full of books like everyone else is complaining about and had them buy nothing... but I realize that this is part of the business.   I honestly think there should be a Bookmans in every large city on the globe. Life would be better and certainly world peace would follow.

Bookman's has changed a lot since I lived in AZ 6 years ago or so. It's still a fantastic mecca for book nerds... actually nerds or all kinds. But, some of the old charm has been replaced by a modern layout and some other changes that killed some of the nostalgia for me. As far as books go, the layout hasn't changed much - rows and rows of high shelves tower over the back of the store with used books of all kinds.   My favorite section of the store has always been the comics area which has been moved but is much larger and has masses and masses of used comics to peruse. The problem now, however is that the prices are extremely confusing. It used to be that all comics were 50 cents or something like that. Now they range in price depending on section, seller, and apparently some books are priced individually. I'm actually not sure exactly how it all works and gave up looking after a while because the few books I wanted were overpriced. It is apparent that the idea of gem hunting for comic books is a thing of the past here. There is some sort of arrangement with a comic book store which has its own little corner of Bookman's and keeps some it's stuff separate. The whole thing was very confusing and overwhelming. With that said, there were some new things I liked such as the figures, posters, etc that the comic store brought with them.   I'm not going to go too crazy on my review here but Bookman's is still a book lover and geek culture lover's dream. Some of the modern changes messed with the romance for me but it's still the best place to look for a good book.

Pei Wei = PF Changs - $10. Basically, if you like Changs, you will like Pei Wei. I am personally a huge fan and have never been disappointed over my many visits. Highly recommended.

Elephant Bar is a place we used to frequent for work meetings and although the food is decent, I never understood the interest in this place. In a city with a ton of diverse dining options, this would not be my first choice but it is definitely decent. Pricey but edible.

I stayed at the Firesky Resort before taking my MCAT and have mixed feelings about my stay. Now granted, I had extremely high anxiety at the time so perhaps I didn't get to see the full glory of this place, but in my opinion it is somewhat overrated. For the price I paid, I expected more.   The resort layout is more like a fantastically designed apartment complex. In fact, I am pretty sure that it was an apartment complex prior to being a resort. With that said, however, the lobby and grounds are absolutely phenomenal. They are stylish, comfortable, and luxurious without being ostentatious.   My room was a little bit less impressive though. It had most of the amenities that I expected, but nothing extra. The artwork wasn't overly impressive and the linens were just average. Also, the TV was small. It certainly wasn't nearly as glorious as the common areas of the resort.  The deck/balcony area was very nice though and I was able to study in the fresh air without any distractions.  If you are wanting to stay at a reasonably nice hotel that is close to everything, the Firesky fits the bill. However, don't expect to be wowed by your room. It is an average room. Nothing less, nothing more.

Now, I rarely get a craving for cupcakes, but I will admit that Sprinkles is about as good as it gets. They are well deserving of the publicity they receive. The frosting is probably the best I've ever had and the cupcakes are fairly large so you don't feel quite as raped when you plop down your life's savings for an afternoon treat.  All of the flavors I've tried are good but the red velvet is definitely the best.  It is likely that a place like this will kill you. But really, would that be the worst way to die...?

This place is one of the best Mexican restaurants you can find in AZ! Now, its not the fanciest, most expensive, or anything like that, but their food is mind-blowing! Depending on when you go, you may be in for a bit of a wait because the restaurant is small, but it is well worth waiting for. When I worked at the Bank of America across the street, I made a trip to Mango's on a daily basis.   My favorite thing on their menu is their Chimichangas but everything is worth a taste. Their seafood tacos/burritos are delicious and you won't be able to find better fruit drinks anywhere!   The price is fair and you won't be sad that you dropped the money.   Beyond this, the staff is amazingly friendly. While they don't speak very good English, they make up for it in great service. The owner is also nearly always there and makes it a very great experience. Mango's is one of those places you can't just go to once. My taste buds still yearn for this food even though I am thousands of miles away!

The Heart Attack Grill is definitely one of the gems of the valley. For all of the negative reviews about the food being greasy and bad for you, I'm not sure what you were expecting. They are exactly what they advertise - a deliciously quick trip to the grave. The burgers are dripping with lard, making them tantilizingly juicy. Of course this is not the place for someone looking for a light, healthy lunch, but for those of us who enjoy indulging in what might be our last meal, a double bypass burger is a worthy choice.   Personally i love the gimmick of the naughty nurses (who i may add are more than willing to sit on your lap while you sweat through a burger and fries) and Dr. Jon.  The Heart Attack Grill is well deserving of their recent fame. Ignore the whiners and try it out!

I personally like this Hooters. Granted, the girls aren't always mind-blowingly hot (although most are good looking), but they are some of the friendliest around.   This one is also in a great location for being close to everything in Tempe but parking is an issue and is metered so make sure you have change.  For being right next to ASU campus, it isn't the liveliest Hooters I've been to, but it fits the bill and offers nice scenery and edible food.

Rubios is the holy grail of Mexican fast food chain restaurants. It is a bit expensive and the portions are a tad bit small but there is quite simply nothing that compares for this type of restaurant in fast food. Now, it is definitely not authentic, but if you know that going in, you won't be disappointed.   Also, let me be clear, there are a ton of better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix but this is a place you can count on to fill your craving every time. It is the best Mexican FAST FOOD out there. I constantly crave the fish tacos and drool over the baha grill burittos. If you want quick fast food with a Mexican flavor, this is a great choice. The staff are very friendly at this location as well.

J. Alexander's was a nice surprise in the Scottsdale area. Not too expensive but classy atmosphere and great food. It was a bit crowded and fairly loud but the staff was wonderful and the food was beautifully prepared.   I would definitely take my wife here on a date.

Fili-B's is the closest thing you can get to real Mexican food in the Phoenix valley. It is dirty and slightly unnerving when you order the first time but in my opinion, it is well worth it. Some people violently disagree and aren't willing to chance getting the runs to eat here, but for me that is a chance I will willingly take.   My order is essentially the same every time: a massive carne asada burrito with a large horchata. So, the moral of the story is that Filibertos isn't for everyone, but for those who aren't afraid of possibly eating cat, it is a winner. It is also very inexpensive so it is popular with the college crowd. Try it.

YC's is a great place to hit up if you have a hunger gap that is bigger then a normal restaurant can fill. It is a build-it yourself mongolian grill and the possibilities are endless for what you can create. No matter what you get, if you are smart, you can manage to stuff enough food in your $12 bowl to feed a small village. The trick is to use the bottom of another bowl to smash your ingredients down.   They have been cracking down on that sneekiness as of late, but if you can get away with it, it is well worth it. Another important point is that they charge you 50 cents for a to-go box, but you will need one so just plan on adding that to the budget. Also, when you are building your meal, the red meats will be more flavorful and you will most certainly need to add more flavorings than the amounts listed on their ingredient list. Have fun because this place is worth it.

I salivate every time I think about this place. I now live almost 3000 miles away, but there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about making the drive for dinner.  Pho Nhat is quite simply the perfect Vietnamese restaurant. It is run down and dingy, but it is extremely cheap and the food is to die for. I could eat their Pho Ga for every meal if I had to.  Don't expect good service or a clean bathroom because neither are there, but what you CAN expect is to fall in love with the food every time you go.  WARNING: Do not order a drink other than water here. There is nothing wrong with the beverages, but you will not get a refill because no one will bring it to you so it will be a waste of your money. I can forgive this because the food is so good.

Let me preface this review by noting that I absolutely adore Carl's Jr! They make the best chain burger in the country and the lack of Carl's Jr in my current city of Cleveland,OH is enough to send a man into a deep depression.   However, since this review is for this specific location, I have to overlook my fondness for CJ to say that this is perhaps one of the most poorly run fast food restaurants I have ever been to. I used to work near this location so this is coming from regular visits to this specific store.   The staff are unfriendly (bordering on rude) and the service is slower than molasses in January. More often than not they get the order wrong as well.   So, as much as I love CJ, a short trip to a different location is well worth the drive.

La Escondida is in my opinion one of the best overall Mexican restaurants in the Scottsdale area. It is a great mix of ambiance, fantastic food, and great service.   I have never had to pay for the food myself when going here so I really don't know what the cost is, but I would certainly be willing to pay more than the average Mexican food rate for the flavors here.   This is one of the places I miss most in AZ.

Anasazi Foundation is one of the greatest companies I've ever had the opportunity to work for. I did a short stint as a Trail Walker and it changed my life.   Anyone who has the means to contribute to this charity, wouldn't make a better investment in our youth. I have seen many lives changed as a result of this program.  Considering the type of program it is, I was also very impressed with the way it was run. Ezekiel, one of the founders of the program, takes an active part in the programs and works directly with the family members of youth who attend.  Definitely a worthy youth rehabilitation program.

I came back to the Phoenix area on my short trip with one very specific task in mind: to eat lots and lots of Mexican food. Backyard Tacos was one step on my journey to taco fulfillment and I primarily went based on reviews from yelp. Apparently this place started off as a tiny little taco shack that was literally based out of someone's backyard (or at least that's the urban legend I was fed). Somehow it expanded into a full sized fast food taco shop with a full (but small) menu. I was told that their tacos were the best in the valley and with a claim like that, I was convinced to challenge it.   Sure enough, when I arrived at lunch time it was packed with a nice long line. I ordered 4 tacos with chips and salsa (which were free with a yelp check-in). I'm generally a carne asada guy do i got 3 of those and 1 of the birria tacos. The wait for my food was long after I placed my order and the staff seemed flustered and not too friendly. The salsa bar had its own long line which was mostly due to being poorly placed in the front corner.  Once my tacos arrived I sat outside along some counter seating (the only thing available). I immediately noticed a strong paint smell (from the counter, not the food) and found that my arms were coated with paint residue from the counter since they obviously didn't take time to put any form of sealant over the paint. It probably bothered me more than it should have so I tried to not let it distract me from the important part - the food.  I was impressed by the carne asada tacos. The meat was nicely flavored and tender. They were a bit small but the price wasn't terrible for what I got. The birria taco wasn't anything special but it was pretty good too. The offerings from the salsa bar were disappointing (I didn't love the flavors and found them relatively bland, especially the guac) but the tacos were good enough to stand on their own and I really only used the salsa for heat (the red salsa is quite smoking hot). My face was screaming for the rest of the day. The chips were good as well but the salsa that came with the chips was actually kind of gross so I ended up using stuff from the salsa bar instead.  Overall I definitely recommend this place but it is by no means the best tacos in the Phoenix valley. Better than Filibertos? No doubt.
