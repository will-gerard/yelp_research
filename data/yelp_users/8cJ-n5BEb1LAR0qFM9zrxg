Wow, what an excellent shop!  I called Bud at M B Motors for some help with an electrical problem on my 1983 300D. He asked me to bring it in, so I did on a Monday morning. He spent some time troubleshooting my issue and it turned out to be a simple fuse--what a relief. He also did an oil change for me and a general inspection of the car. He was very knowledgeable, up-front, honest, and informative. I asked several questions that weren't even related to the repair job at hand, and he gave me lots of good information. I get the impression that if you needed more serious work done, this is the place you'd want to visit.  Note that they work on only Mercedes Benz vehicles. There were several cars there, from 1970's models to current models.  Several other customers stopped by while I was there and seemed to be on a friendly first-name basis with the owner. That's a good sign in my book.

Consummate professionals.  I called at 8:30pm on a Saturday night with a broken A/C unit. They indeed called back within the hour (as promised on their web site) and offered to come out the same night. The woman who called clearly explained what the rates would be and what I could expect. I decided it could wait until morning (since one of our two units was still working) so we agreed on 9:00am Sunday morning.  The technician arrived promptly, was very personable and polite, and quickly diagnosed and fixed the issue. He explained that their technicians do not work on commission so they are not under any pressure to oversell or overcharge.  House is nice and cool now--everything is great. Huge thank you to AccuTemp. 100 degree heat + broken A/C = no fun.

"You guys have any specials running tonight?"   "Yeah 22oz domestic drafts for $3." "Okay cool, I'll take a Blue Moon."   "That's not part of the special." "Is it on draft?"   "Yes." "It's made by Coors."   "Yeah, well."   So... it's not ALL domestic drafts. It's just the cheapa-- domestic drafts.  I can't stand stuff like this. The guy was friendly enough though.

"Meh" across the board. It's a "meh" smorgasbord, if I may be so bold.  They vacuum the car, but neglect to vacuum any hard-to-reach spots. So, your floorboards will be clean but you'll still have french fries stuck between your seats.  They send the car through an automatic wash. Yawn.  They put your car through the "finishing" routine where people definitely appear to be working hard to scrub off bugs, clean the rims, polish the windows, and so on. Don't let them fool you--they're moving a lot, but they're not working that hard.  A spot inspection of your car may not reveal any obvious issues, but once you're five blocks away, you'll start to notice the windshield is streaked, there are crumbs in the leather wrap around your shift knob, and so on. Basically your car passes the squint test, but it doesn't hold up to any kind of scrutiny.  Pay the 10-year-old kid on your block $5 to wash your car and you'll get about the same result.

This Rock Bottom is awful. A poor example of an already poor chain.  What's comical is that we came here with gift certificates we got from the manager of the Desert Ridge location after our food came out cold after a 45-minute wait. We figured maybe another location would be better.  Dead wrong. I don't know if the food was an improvement because we went on a Saturday afternoon and waited a full 5 minutes inside before being acknowledged and seated. The place was deserted and we sat at our table for another 10 minutes before being approached by a waiter reeking of cigarette smoke. I guess this restaurant is being run by 1 or 2 people? I wouldn't be surprised if the hostess was back in the kitchen ready to cook our order.  We didn't wait around to find out. I eventually took my gift certificates to the Scottsdale location and blew them all on beer and filet mignon before they expired, but that's a different review.

Consummate professionals.  They were communicative, prompt, on time, and the job was done right in a minimum amount of time.   That's all you need from a plumber.

My wife and I have been talking about returning here for quite some time, and finally decided to make good on it. I was a bit wary of the price because it's clearly one of the most expensive places around. I had a coupon from one of those infamous "Entertainment" books, but that didn't soften the blow much.  We made a reservation, which they "strongly recommend", but showed up 20 min early and they were happy to accommodate us. The place was nearly deserted at 4:45pm on a Saturday, although it was Labor Day weekend when people are out of town.  Our coupon was good for the "Big Feast" even though I had doubts about being able to stomach the dessert after eating cheese fondue, salad, and a main course. We got the Swiss cheese fondue, which was excellent. Next, the caprese salad, which is very light and refreshing after all that cheese (however, it contains even more cheese), and then the main source which is basically a bunch of raw meats on a platter that you cook with your choice of liquids. We went with the coq a vin or whatever it is, and the basic set of meats because we don't like lobster enough to pay extra for its inclusion. Everything seemed fresh and the sauces they provide are good. Nothing that really hits it out of the park, but good. For dessert, we had the chocolate with marshmallows, which was mainly in deference to my wife because I despise marshmallows.  At some point, the manager came around to ask if everything was okay. I always enjoy this interaction at restaurants, as it indicates the manager is actually interested in the quality of service and food. Everything was good, and we left full and happy. They could work on those sauces and make the main course something that really pops -- as it stands, it seems like the cheese and dessert fondues are more the highlights of the meal.

Unfortunately I have to downgrade my rating of this restaurant after today's events.  I'll preface this review with the recognition that The Melting Pot recommends reservations. However, of the many many times we've visited this location, we've never had a problem getting right in without a reservation owing to the fact that we go at off-times. So we have a long history of going without a reservation, and have always been seated--maybe with a 30 min wait at most, but usually right away.  My wife and I walked in at 4:00pm on Sunday (our 12th wedding anniversary) and the parking lot was nearly empty. The hostess gave us the usual "Can I help you?" which I have always found odd, as if there is some other reason I would be there than to eat. We said we didn't have a reservation and she immediately told us we couldn't be accommodated. Apparently they had sold a "living social" and thus the restaurant was just impossibly booked.  This was (almost) comical because the place was deader than disco--not even a single human voice could be heard. I happen to know what Living Social is, but what if I didn't? Why is that my concern, and why is that being given as a reason for not seating me? Not "we're all booked up", which I can understand, but apparently they were saving empty tables in case people decide to come in and redeem their Living Social coupons. Shame on me, I guess, for not getting a coupon.  To be clear, I have absolutely no problem with being turned away at a restaurant that recommends reservations. That's my fault for ignoring the recommendation. I do have a problem with being turned away at a half-empty restaurant because they did a Living Social deal and thus they can't accommodate me just in case these hypothetical coupon-holders come in the door. If that's how you want to run your business, fine, but don't make it the customer's problem.  I've spent thousands here and won't be going back ever again. So, I hope your "Living Social" was worth screwing over your long-term customers.

Yuck, really?  I never go to Best Buy, but I went over the weekend to try some laptop comparison shopping with my wife. I just wanted to her try different models and see which ones she liked.  First, what are you doing at the door, Guy Standing At The Door? Are you a receipt checker? I can't stand that kind of gestapo B.S. If you are a greeter, and you did greet us, why are you standing at a podium, Richard Dawson?  Onward. They have the laptops arranged by brand... kind of? There are a couple laptops of each brand, but then they have endcaps of laptops or no known reason, and a whole row of "student" laptops for which the criteria is anyone's guess. The "Apple" section is also segregated 20 feet away with curtains, as if to prevent an infiltration of filth from the Windows PCs.   My wife managed to inspect a couple of the laptops for at least 30 seconds before being jostled aside by an associate trying to get into a storage cage. I marveled at the signs advertising the Geek Squad service of essentially turning on your laptop and uninstalling a couple unwanted apps for like $100. How many people have been suckered into this, I wonder.  Then... there is a Cox Cable guy roaming around? Why am I being accosted by a third-party vendor inside of Best Buy?

Overall I was happy with this shop.  It's always a roll of the dice when you choose a new repair shop. You're there because you lack either the expertise or the facilities to perform your own car repair, so you are placing your baby in their hands.   I looked this shop up on AAA, and they are a certified AAA shop that won a Top Shop reward last year. I figured that was relatively low risk, so I brought in my high-mileage Mazda whose CEL recently came on. They came back with a timely quote for work performed. They didn't present anything strange or out in left field from what I requested, so I felt secure accepting their quote and having them do the work. I got the impression I was being dealt with honestly, which is a huge plus.  The work was performed well and within the time frame they estimated. Overall, good experience. Their labor costs may be a bit higher than average, but it seems worth it for the good customer service experience.

We had a really good experience here.  My wife had the idea to go in and look for gifts for some men in my family, since I had been agonizing over what to purchase. We went in and I announced to the guy working that I was looking for gifts--I might as well hang a sign around my neck reading "Cigar Noob".  The guy was really cool though. He took time to answer my questions and to make suggestions based on what I said. What I really appreciated is that he didn't try to sell me expensive cigars--he suggested a modest selection that would be good for less experienced smokers.  I got the overall impression that his primary interest was gaining a customer. It worked, because I will definitely be back to peruse their selection and pick out some for myself.

Very affordable and friendly cleaners. After having done dry cleaning in Scottsdale for years at $5/item or even more, I was kind of stunned about how cheap this place is. You can even sign up for a club if you do a lot of dry cleaning/laundry and save even more.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the staff here is very nice--to the point of being out of character for cleaners. They will take time to inspect each item you bring in to ensure you are asking for the right kind of service for each fabric type. When you pick the items up, they will also inspect them in front of you to make sure you are happy with how everything turned out.  I recommend!

I've never had a bad experience with this location! Of course it's not the best pizza in the world, but it deserves to be measured against its own potential.  The online ordering process is really painless--don't bother calling. I was hesitant to do it at first, but they really have their system down. You can even watch a little progress meter that tells you when they are making your order, when they are checking it, and when they leave the store with it if you requested delivery. There are always coupons available online as well.  The orders we've placed have always been correct. We don't just order pizza--at times we've ordered wings, sandwiches, soda, and even specialty items like gluten-free crust pizza. They nail it every time.

Everyone's been to a Water & Ice franchise and there's not much to it. Jugs, water, candy, ice cream, shaved ice. Maybe a cart.  What makes the place freaking awesome is the Indian couple who run it. I've never seen them there together, but one or the other is always there. The woman is very friendly but not all that chatty. The man, however (I want to say he introduced himself as Max, but I'm terrible with names and since my brain had reserved a space for a more Indian-like name, it rejected Max.) is ultra cool and will converse seemingly indefinitely about any number of topics. He loves to talk about the contrasts between India and America, that much is certain. For example, he corrected my belief that people from disparate areas in India speak only English to each other. Only true in business and academia--else, it's Hindi.  I don't really mind. It turns the normally boring task of "getting water", something I'd never imagined when I lived in Michigan, into a potentially enlightening experience.  Oh... $3 minimum charge when using a debit card.

Revisited this place right at 5:00 when they open for dinner. They seemed a bit unprepared, like all the staff had not arrived. So, for the first 15-20 minutes we had what seemed like a "fill-in" server who did not know the menu.  I was all good though... had the Chicken Saag. It was fan-tastic. My parents ordered other dishes and we split two orders of naan among us. They pimp drinks here a lot--must be a high margin item for them. The only disappointing thing about the saag was that I asked for it spicy and it was not spicy. I mean it was Cleveland spicy, not Punjab spicy.  As an aside, this place is always good for people-watching. We had the pretentious neo-hippies next to us who couldn't be bothered to have their children sit down to eat, lest their creativity be stifled.

We returned to Star of India recently to enjoy the lunch buffet on a weekend. The restaurant was pretty empty the last three times we've been here--I hope that's not a bad sign!  The buffet is somewhat limited as others have noted. There is stuff to make salad, plus about 8 entrees, various sauces, rice, naan, a few desserts, and Indian tea. Everything is quite delicious, but if you are looking to sample a wide variety of Indian cuisine, this won't quite do the trick. The entrees are quite filling though--I really had to press myself to try a little bit of everything. You will leave feeling like you just ate enough to last for two days!  I find the staff to be quite helpful and friendly, as well.

Holy crap this place is good! I can't believe I've driven past it 89 times and went, "Meh, not just yet."  The people working there are super friendly, and you can tell they have a lot of regulars. The decor is spotless and tasteful.  The food. Mmm boy. Yes they have most of the "typical" food found at a Chinese restaurant, but guess what? It doesn't taste like they got it frozen off the back of a Chinese delivery truck like at other places. Really fresh, nicely prepared and presented, and delicious. I've ordered kung pow chicken at probably in the neighborhood of 50 restaurants, and this was easily the best. They also have specials written on the wall that look like unique and delicious creations, like spicy eggplant with prawns. I went with my standby meal to start, but I'll surely try something new next time.

Oooh what a treasure. 5 regular restaurant stars? Nah. 5 buffet stars.   This place does appear a bit on the pricey side if you go for dinner, but we went for lunch and it was very reasonable. Plus, look what you get: all the normal Chinese buffet stuff, PLUS the whole Mongolian grill table experience, PLUS all-you-can-eat sushi, made to order. You literally just walk up and order fresh sushi off of a fairly extensive menu, and it's all included in the price. It's better than all-you-can-eat steak night at the Sizzler.  The food is fresh and tasted great. They have a great selection that goes beyond a lot of the typical buffet stuff, like frog legs and lychee fungus. Trust me, it's very refreshing. The hot and sour soup is phenom. They had 99-cent bottled beers as well.  Also, the staff is really nice. The waiter assigned to our table swooped in at regular intervals to grab dirty dishes and refill glasses. He was friendly, efficient, and nearly invisible, which is pretty much the perfect recipe for a waiter.  Try it for lunch at the lower prices and see for yourself!

There is no reason to go to Olive Garden. None at all.  This place outclasses, outshines, outserves, and, more important, outcooks any other Italian restaurant I've been to in the valley. It is tiny for sure, but tiny in an intimate, cozy way that almost makes you feel like you're a guest in the owners' home. The atmosphere is great for family dining. The food is out of this world, seriously. We tried the fettucine and the ravioli, and we cleaned our plates despite protests from internal organs. Even the salads are money.  I can't wait to go back and explore the menu!

Try not to view Ironwood as an extension of the huge Burton Barr library and look at it for what it really is--a small community library. It is a great resource for Ahwatukee. It's clean, has free wifi and plenty of popular items, and is a great place to get out of the heat during the summer for any number of people.  Since they're part of the Phoenix library system, they have access to great services like the Overdrive catalog. Go online and log in with your library card to check out audiobooks and ebooks! You can check out 10 at a time. There are also plenty of great community programs like the Culture Passes mentioned in another review.  The one downside is that the staff is pretty unhelpful (and sometimes unfriendly). I've had my daughter ask for a book because it was listed as being on the shelf but it wasn't in its place. I don't need a staff member to walk over to the shelf, look at the empty spot, and then shrug, saying it must be lost. I could discern that myself. Some of the ladies working behind the counter (I don't know what their function is) are downright unfriendly and sullen. Retire and let some newer blood in, if you hate your job that much.  Ignore the staff and you'll be golden.

Um, something has happened to this place, and it ain't good. I felt like I walked into a Cronenberg film where you don't know if anything is real.  Every redeeming quality is now gone. The roaming singer is gone. They have a bar but don't even produce drink menus any more, and the waitstaff can't readily list drinks available. Not good when the wife is looking for drinks. The service is awkward and slow, even though they sat us at a table next to at least a half dozen servers who loitered around the kitchen area with the manager. I couldn't tell if they were off the clock or hanking or both.   The only reason we went here is because they take reservations and someone in our party was concerned about restaurants being crowded. The hostess made a point of telling us over the phone that they don't usually take reservations on such short notice, but they would accommodate us. When we arrived, the place was mostly empty. Inflated sense of self-importance, much?  The only reason I bothered updating this is because you might be like me: easily conned into going here when you're hungry. Well, resist the temptation and insist on going elsewhere.

I've been here twice now with friends and our kids and we really like this joint.  There is an important key to working yourself up to "liking" a bowling alley. You've got to get yourself into the bowling state of mind. It's not really even about the game itself. It's about the rental shoes (No, don't think about their rich and colorful history; you'll never touch your own feet again). It's about the music (Who controls the music? Seriously, they've got a schizophrenic's iPod set to shuffle up there). It's about the food -- food that will revisit you in various ways for days after you leave the alley.  Are you pumped up now? Are you feeling like some bowling? Now you may enter Mesa East Bowl. Get your shoes and order some french fries. Start the maddening routine of finding a ball that isn't either light as a feather but somehow with enormous finger holes or heavier than a white dwarf star with tiny finger holes. There, that one is just right... except the finger holes seem to be on opposite ends of the ball.   The people here are nice and accommodating. The kids have a blast. It's cheaper than some of the big commercial lanes. They have all the modern technology, even a fun thing that tells you how fast you threw the ball. Before entering into some kind of macho competition involving said speed indicator, consider whether you require the use of your arm for the next week.  But I digress. A great weekend diversion. Don't measure a bowling alley against anything other than bowling alley standards and you'll love this place.

Really nice place with a good inventory.  I don't have a bike yet, so I was here to round up some gear. They know when you don't have a bike yet... they can smell you like a fart in a car. But they were cool and offered to help with anything I needed. One guy helped me pick out a helmet that is shaped well for my head.   The prices are reasonable and a lot of things were are on sale--overall, I would recommend to any rider.

Pretty lame, even for Casa Grande. Went on a Thursday night when they are supposed to be open until midnight. They apparently decided they wanted to close early because hardly anyone was there, so the waitress told us it was last call at 9:30 even though we had not even been there very long and were clearly planning to stay for the evening. Awesome.  The beer selection is very basic. Maybe two of the taps rise above the level of barely tolerable, for anyone who's into flavorful beer. But, I guess that's a function of their clientele more than anything else. I'm not a beer snob by any means, but give me something more than light domestics.

Mi Amigo Ricardo is a Casa Grande staple. True, the food is not 5-star gourmet Mexican food, but it offers a tremendous value. It is great food, served fresh and fast. The prices are very reasonable. I have always found the staff to be friendly, and the owners are usually hanging around the front register to greet people and send them off after their meal. Regulars are noted and greeted as such.  The pizza-sized cheese crisp is a must! However, I'm not crazy about the salsa. It's on the tables in ketchup bottles, and is too runny for my taste. To each his own, though. The combos are the best -- a huge plate of good food for a price you can't beat unless you go to Taco Bell, whose food is inedible.

Great place to find some tasty goods that are difficult to locate elsewhere! If you are a bit of a fanatic for beer, wine, cheese, baked goods, or some higher end groceries, you will find a lot to be happy about here. They also have great iced tea, italian soda, dinners ready to eat, and a huge salad bar. It's great if you are looking for a light meal and dessert without doing the whole restaurant thing. They have plenty of outdoor seating for you to enjoy what you just purchased.  I have found some oddball stuff here like off-brands of pasta sauce, olive oil, and other "fine foods" as they mention. They also have premium meats and seafood, and hard-to-find things like British banger sausage.  DO NOT buy regular stuff here that you can get at a mainstream grocery store. Their produce and other everyday items are marked up by at least 50% just because you are at AJ's. No sense in paying $2.00 for a can of tuna when the exact same can is 79 cents at Fry's or Safeway.

This is a nice place to relax and have a drink or a meal while you're in the Chandler mall area. It's actually on the mall property, so it's easy walking distance from the mall itself and the nearby Harkins theater. I recommend hitting them for happy hour between 3-7 weekdays and then taking in some shopping or a movie.  The menu is rather extensive and most of the offerings are quite tasty. The avocado egg rolls in particular stand out, and they usually have interesting offerings like bratwurst sliders and other bar food.   Some of the beers really stand out, and this is why you'd want to visit BJ's in the first place. If they have the seasonal Grand Cru, definitely give it a try, but don't plan on driving anywhere any time soon, as it's a very strong brew (10% abv). The porter and stout are very good. The hefeweizen is a bit watery and underwhelming.

Overall, I was pretty impressed with Flancer's. There are a lot of interesting dishes on the menu and the restaurant has a cool vibe that makes you want to hang out for a while. I tried the hatch chile burger, which is served on a long roll and includes a very tasty brown mustard (which you can request they leave off if you are not a mustard fan). The burgers and a lot of the other things are on the pricey side.. this one was $10 and I can't say the quality of beef was quite up to par with what I'd expect at that price point.  I was on vacation when I visited, and when I'm on vacation I like to drink beer, and when I see a "beer" sign in the window of a restaurant, I look forward to beer. No, the selection of beer at Flancer's is lame, lame, lame. Pale and tasteless American lagers, with the exception of bottles of Kiltlifter. Mr. Flancer, diners have moved on, and these days are looking for interesting and tasty craft beers. Kiltlifter is a good, if very safe, start. Chuck the rest of them and make some deals to serve Four Peaks, Santan, Arizona Wilderness, and other local brewery's stuff on tap.

This place has really gone downhill over the last year or so. I don't know if it's the "economic downturn" or what -- but one used to get great service and a great wash here. No more.  First, a lot is missing/gone. They used to have a tinting business and a lively detailing team. Now, you're lucky to see anything getting detailed. The bays are empty most of the time. They used to have a decent selection of refreshments inside. Now, there are empty coolers and a huge one full of weird off-brand bottled water. They do have fountain drinks, as evidenced by the steady parade of employees coming in to fill their cups. No customers filling cups, though.  The customer service experience is awful now, at least at the front end. As you drive up, two sharks begin circling you. The first shark is the guy who used to just take your wash order and give you a receipt. Now, it is Upsell Man, a strange and powerful supervillian whose mission is to sell you detailing services... you know, to fill those empty bays. He will stop at nothing, offering free washes, discounts, all kinds of stuff. Today he was lackluster, only asking, "You okay on waxing?" I did just get my back waxed the other day, so I guess the answer is yes. He went back to the cigarette he was forced to set down when I pulled up. Cool.. I had gone all day without walking through second-hand smoke, so that was good. The second shark is Auto Glass Man. You know him. You've had to dodge him at gas stations, supermarkets, maybe even your work place. I need say no more about Auto Glass Man, but he is now circling your car looking for cracks and dings. If he spots one, Jebus help you.  If you make it past this gauntlet, the actual workers will start vacuuming your car. They are pretty good at this. Then the car proceeds through an auto wash. While this is happening, you go through a large depressing room to pay for your wash. Today was extra exciting because the cashier appeared to have her young children on hand. Why pay for child care? They sprinted around the room, yelling, crying, crashing into chairs, into myself, and so on. The boy of about 2 or 3 carried an open bottle of Sprite which splashed merrily about the floor as he ran. The cashier alternated between standing behind the counter texting and yelling things at the kids. I enjoyed this scene for a while and then paid my tab and proceeded outside. There are some sad remnants of further upselling that used to occur, the "wash booklets", but the cashier now has no time or interest for such things.  Now when you get outside, you witness the area where the real work is occurring. My car was shining with water and now being attended to by a man who dries it, cleans the windows and interior, scrapes bugs off the front, and so on. I paid $20 for the "Super Works", which is supposed to include a "deep clean" of the doors and dash, among other things. Like a previous Yelper, I considered this expensive but hopefully worth the money. I have kids and the car gets amess. One has to keep up appearances. The guy worked hard and appeared to pay attention to all areas of the car. He even covered some areas I don't usually see them cover. When he was finished, I inspected the car, tipped him, and left.  Now, 5-10 minutes after you leave the Auto Wash is what I like to call the "WTF Zone". I call it this because that's when you start noticing the stuff they missed, but you are too far away to go back because you have already burned your lunch hour. In this case, he missed the insides of the back windows (which are still covered with my kids' fingerprints), the leather wrapping of my stick shift (dirty/dusty), and roughly half of the steering wheel (half is glazed with protectant, half is dirty).   Well, whatever. No one is perfect. There used to be two or three people working on each car, in better days. Now you get one and they miss stuff. He did scrape off the melted wax that had gathered in my center console when my daughter left crayons in the car, which I had been avoiding for weeks. Worth $20? No way.

I was tipped off to this place by a friend I worked out with at the LA Fitness next door, so I decided to give it a try. The food is above average, for sure. It is possible to get a healthy, filling lunch for less than $10, so that's a huge plus for me. Way better than the crap they serve at Paradise Bakery masquerading as healthy, and more variety than Subway every day.  I got the roast beef bagel sandwich on wheat, toasted, with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, sprouts, and mustard. The lunch deal comes with a side (I got fruit salad) and a drink. Yes I know bagels are not the most healthy bread, but I love me a good bagel, yes sir.  The thing that really moves this place up to 4 stars from 3 is the service. They asked my name and were very friendly, asking if it was my first time in, an repeating my name several times as I checked out and left. I got the feeling they were interested in my coming back and probably would remember my name.

Excellent and friendly place to have a meal. The staff here is very very nice--a little out of character for North Scottsdale. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, especially if you go at peak lunch hour as there are a lot of office parks nearby.  The food is very good. You can get a lot of your traditional heart-stopping Italian grub here (like a meatball sandwich) but they have a lot of variety for those who like to eat lighter as well. There is plenty on the menu besides pizza.

As far as auto repair places go, Airpark Auto is one of the best. They are professional, organized, and most important, they don't seem to be out to rip people off.  I've never had a problem making an appointment at Airpark Auto, and they have a free shuttle service to take you back to work or home and pick you up again when your car is done. The desk staff is courteous, and sometimes the owner will even answer when you call.  The shop is AAA certified which means their repairs are guaranteed to some extent, and there is an arbitration process they must go through if you have a dispute. They are also certified as a "green" shop which means they meet certain standards of environmental responsibility.  I've brought several cars to Airpark Auto numerous times and I've always had a good experience. They are honest with their estimates and will not perform unnecessary repairs or inflate the work order. They post coupons on their web site but will give them to you automatically.  The only complaint I have about this shop is that the oil change technicians seem to lack a degree of attention to detail. I started bringing my cars here for oil changes so I could get certified mechanics rather than whomever they dig up to work at Jiffy Lube. On two occasions they returned my car to me missing valve stem caps, which baffled me because I was getting low tire pressure warnings at the same time. If they removed my valve stem caps, presumably to fill my tires, why was the pressure low? I brought it to their attention the first time and they replaced the caps. The next time I came, the caps were intact when I picked up the car. The time after that, two caps missing again, and low tire pressure. I was pretty annoyed and I didn't want to scream at anyone, so I just left.  Overall, great place, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. If I had gone in and complained about the caps that day, I'm sure they would have made it right.

Went here with a large group for a holiday lunch.  It was... just okay. We pick a different restaurant every year, and we've yet to hit a jackpot. But, hey, free lunch.  The server was really nice but made some noob mistakes like not writing down the table positions of who ordered what. What ensued was a bunch of people circling the table for 10 minutes going, "Turkey club? Turkey club?" No one ever did own up to that turkey club. I got the fish and chips which were Long John Silver-esque. Definitely not impressed.  Their beers are okay but I didn't order any on this particular trip. Maybe the food is more impressive after a few Kiltlifters?

All right, let's get something out of the way straight off: It's not easy for a man to decide that a) he could stand to have a bit less hair on his body, and b) a professional waxing might be the ticket.  If you're that man, however, you can't get any better than Just For You. They have a whole section on their page dedicated to men's waxing, and their professional attitude removes any doubt you might have that you're doing something odd. Men are getting waxed en masse, like it or not. And why not?  Sure it hurts, but they do great work, and your wife/gf/partner/whatever will love it. So get in there, you baby.

We were seated. We perused the menu. We chatted. We colored. We waited. We were not ever approached by a server, not in 10-15 minutes of sitting there.

Allow me to join the ranks of those who are stunned and disoriented over exactly how good a car dealership can be. I'm one of those people who bashes car dealerships whenever I can--I never met one that wasn't completely crooked and shady from asses to appetites. Until we went to Hyundai of Tempe, that is.  I know there might be dealerships out there that offer even better service--if you're buying a Ferrari or a Maybach--but for us commoners, I don't think it gets any better than this.  My wife and I purchased a vehicle here a few months ago, and I waited to write this review because I wanted to see every part of their business model, including follow-up communication and the service department.   The buying experience was amazing. The salesperson was very patient with us. My wife drove several vehicles before deciding on one, and the salesperson went along with us, switched out plates, explained features, and never once showed any sign of flagging interest or energy. He also talked to my wife when we made clear the car was for her--many salespeople will continue talking to the husband assuming "the man is going to make the decision". So, if you're a woman who's hesitant about stepping into this stereotypical "man's world", don't hesitate to visit this dealership. The negotiation process was tolerable as can be, and the financing segment was clear and painless. They didn't play the "what do you want your payments to be" game; they just came back with a set of options for financing that made the interest rate, term, and payments very clear. YMMV on negotiating and financing--do your homework and learn how to handle these things. After the sale, they stuck around even well past closing to do a full walk-around and show her all the features of the car. HER, not me. Good on them.  The follow-up communication has been very good. I think there was one contact to get feedback about the buying process, and one contact to let us know about a minor recall with the car and how to deal with it. Most everything has been by mail or email. Some dealerships will sell your contact information to third-party extended warranty companies, etc. but I've seen no evidence that this occurred.  This week I finally took the vehicle in for its initial oil change. I scheduled the appoint via the dealership's web site, but it did not go through to the dealership's system for some reason (despite my having 2-3 email confirmations about the appointment). This was absolutely no problem for Casey, the service adviser I got. Without blinking an eye, he took my keys and told me I'd be taken care of within the hour. Full oil change, checks, and they even washed the car. The first service is even free! They have a nice comfortable waiting area with free wi-fi as well.  You can't do better, unless you have way more money than I do.

Unfortunately I have to deduct a star due to the shenanigans that have occurred two of the three times I've brought a car here for service. Both problems were a result of my scheduling the service appointment online. They push their online scheduling tool as the preferred method of getting an appointment, but both times it has failed to pass my appointment information on to my service advisor. This means I show up when I'm not expected, which I hate doing.   Both times this has happened, my advisor has attempted to make it right by taking my vehicle anyway, but this means I have to wait 2 hours for an oil change rather than the 30 minutes it would normally take if my appointment had been recorded properly. I think it's been handled as gracefully as possible on the spot, but the fact that it's happened twice over six months means there are communication problems between the service staff and whoever is pushing the online scheduling tool.  Please, either fix it, or just have people call the advisors directly.

Bustling local watering hole with friendly staff and good food. They have off-track betting as well, if that's your bag.  We sat outside on a Saturday night and even though the place was packed, we received very good service all night. Our server was seemingly present whenever needed--any time one of the six of us was empty, she was at our table within the next minute offering another drink. The bar selection is somewhat limited, to my surprise--they have all the makings of everyday drinks, but a couple people in my party attempted ordering drinks they didn't have the ingredients for.  The food is really good. I got the reuben, which is fantastic. The kraut is just right, and everything was cooked to crispy perfection. It's no gourmet faire, but the prices are right and everything seems solid. The others in my group enjoyed their meals as well.

Really nice zoo! If you go via I-10 to the 303, you also get to gawk at the old Phoenix Trotting Park, which is a bonus.  Quick Tip: Park and enter through the East Entrance, which is near the aquarium. If you stay past the zoo's closing time (the aquarium is open much later), you'll want your car near the entrance that's still open.  It's admittedly a tad unimpressive if you enter through the West entrance. It appears that most of their older exhibits are there, many of them simply a fenced in dirt-and-grass area with a shabby wood shelter. There is also a sad little carousel that looks right out of a defunct North Korean amusement park.  The selection of animals here is really phenomenal; I don't know the exact numbers, but they have a sign up claiming to be in the top 30 zoos in the country in animal diversity. Some highlights are the immense bird collection, the Reptile House, the Baby Animal Nursery (Come on--is there anything cuter than a baby ocelot contemplating scratching your face off?), and of course, the Aquarium. They've done a great job on this new section of the zoo, and it looks like they have even more planned. The hands-on stingray exhibit was a hit with the kiddo.  There are a lot of "extras" that cost additional cash as people have mentioned in past reviews. We did the sky ride and the train ride, which were worth the few bucks they cost. The food at the little cafes is typically overpriced for any zoo. One difference between this and the Phoenix Zoo is that there is also a really "nice" restaurant on the property, the Tiburon. We didn't try it, but it looked like a great menu and a nice diversion even if you're not going to the zoo.  Overall a really nice place. The staff is exceptionally friendly. It's a bit pricey, but it's a must-see for any animal lovers. Plus, it's the only aquarium in the state. If you've been conned into one of those Entertainment Guides, there is a buy one-get one coupon for admission.

My family went here on Sunday morning for some breakfast before spending a day at the zoo. It was just okay -- the food was good but I've had better service at soup kitchens.  I believe everyone's order was satisfactory. No home runs but maybe a ground-rule double. The omelet was good and tasted fresh. Everything was hot and/or cold as appropriate. Everyone got white toast despite requests on the contrary. The iced tea was nice but tasted like the pot hadn't been cleaned in some time.  The service was plain awful. I knew it was going to be trouble when the server asked us if she was going to need a piece of paper to write down our order. It doesn't exactly instill one with confidence. What kind of question is that? Is that a way of asking us if our order is going to be complicated? For Pete's sake, lady, show some professionalism. Either you need to write it down or you don't -- that isn't our question to answer. She appeared to commit the order to memory, but see note above about the toast.  The food was sllloooooww to come out. Thirty minutes from walking in the front door, we did not have food. I'm not the sort of person that minds waiting for good food, but I at least appreciate status updates and attention from the wait staff in the mean time. No such luck. Glasses sat empty. Once the food came out, we had to ask for a place setting. And then salt and pepper. And then butter and jam for the toast. The glasses were still empty despite refill promises from two different servers. Finally I walked up to the bar and stepped behind it to fill our iced tea glasses. A server who was standing there monkeying around with the computer turned around with a pretentious, "Can I HELP you?" Hilarity ensued as this man tried grasping what was going down -- a customer dared sticking it to the man and getting his own drink refill lest he whither away from dehydration. We were going to the zoo, you see. The funny thing about this maneuv is that it never fails to get the attention of server...  She emerged very apologetic (and so did the other server who promised us refills) and even brought us a pitcher of tea with to-go cups so we could take some with us. So, all's well that ends well. I felt a bit sorry for this server, who was obviously repentant but still lacking the basic attention to detail and customer focus that should be a base requirement for anyone working in the service industry.  Although I'm tempted to see what this place is like at dinner, with the live music, we won't be back.

Halo is the absolute best place in the valley to get pierced, hands down. They are fanatical about cleanliness, as well they should be. They also take the time to inform people about the piercing decisions they are making. The staff there is no-nonsense and they are quick to let someone know if they are making a bad decision.   They are also quick to dispose of know-it-alls who don't want to take their expert advice. Some view that as a negative, but I think they need to take that posture to maintain their reputation.

Holy crap -- venues like this exist in Phoenix? Who knew?  My friends and I were waiting in an unholy line at the Rhythm Room to see Tommy Castro, and we started getting this dread feeling that we weren't going to get in. I used my handy-dandy Yelp BlackBerry app to look up what was nearby, and saw Char's, so close all this time that I could have thrown a sock full of manure and hit it. The Char's web site isn't exactly what you'd call "mobile friendly" but I could see from the Yelp reviews that it had music every night.  We decided to drive over and check it out -- best decision ever. The place is quite a bit smaller than RR, with an intimate stage and little dance floor. The band Soul Power was setting up, and we ordered drinks from the friendly waitress. There is a cool cat sitting at the door collecting the (considerably lower than RR) cover charge, who we later found out is the owner.   I can't adequately describe the effect Soul Power had on us. I could say I was blown through the opposite wall, but that doesn't quite sum it up. I was... funkified. Electrified. Wow, what a band. What a room. What a night.  Oh, and it's cheap to drink there.

I never knew this place existed when I lived in Phoenix, but on a recent visit to relatives we were taken there and I was quite happy with the quality of food. Maybe my tastes are "off" due to living in upstate NY for a year and no longer knowing the joy of good Mexican food, but I thought it was darned tasty. The entrees we got were all good, and even the chips and salsa they place on the table is good.  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because I thought the service, while quick and efficient, was cold and impersonal. The server was sitting at the bar and chatting with someone rather than attending to our table most of the time, and when he finally dropped off the check, he didn't tell us it's meant to be taken up to the front. I don't mind doing that, but I don't like restaurants that leave you guessing as to whether the server will be your cashier or not.  So... remember to take your check to the front yourself.

This place is crazy good. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's definitely a "mom and pop" place with limited seating and slower service. But your service comes with a smile from a nice old guy who seems genuinely happy to have your business, which is becoming rarer all the time.  If you don't know anything about Ecuadorian food, you will have a good time and a lot of surprises exploring the menu. They have some things you might recognize by name, like tamales and empanadas, but bear in mind they are prepared in a different style from what Mexican restaurants would serve.  Be a little adventurous and try some things that might be new to you--I don't think you can go wrong at Mi Comida!

A great little place to stop and have breakfast in downtown Chandler. Their menu is pretty extensive and they have a lot of things ranging from traditional American breakfast (pancakes, waffles, eggs, etc.) to Mexican offerings such as chorizo.  I got the chorizo and eggs which was very tasty but not exactly a great consistency. The chorizo was kind of runny and ground to a texture that's much too fine for my preference. The effect was not all that great, if you take my meaning. But everything tasted great and the service was quick and friendly.  This is a place that pushes a loyalty program on you, so if you are the kind of person who hates that kind of thing, I'd stay away.

There are two important elements to measuring a tattoo shop: the artists they employ and the service level of the shop itself.  Divinity has some top-notch artists, but like most other shops, they really have a knack for rotating some lousy people through there. Sometimes their art is great but they are obnoxious and unreliable, sometimes it is the other way around. Just make sure you check out the portfolios and pick someone whose art you like. Get a sense of them when you schedule your consultation. If they are flaky and non-communicative right off the bat, pick someone else.   There are a couple core artists there that really raise the overall quality. Dub is one of them. My wife and I have gotten three pieces from him, all of the highest quality, design, and thoughtfulness. Dub has a particular style and he will tell you if your design doesn't fit it. He is a fantastic artist in other media, so he excels at doing original drawings and designs. I have also heard great things about Paolo (the owner), but he wasn't taking new clients last time I looked.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the shop can be difficult to communicate with at times. They probably need a dedicated shop manager with good business communication skills, but this is a common problem across most tattoo shops I've been to.

Great dive bar!  I don't have a ton to add to what others have said. However, I will say that they have -real- bartenders here. Some of you will know why this matters, and some won't. If you only ever order bottled beer, you probably don't care. But if you've ever ordered a sloe gin fizz from a server and had her come back ten minutes later and go, "Um, like, what's in a sloe gin fizz?" then you do care. Great bartenders at Coach House know their shizzle from their fizzle.

The ultimate conundrum...  Good food -- weird and/or poor service. Some of us go out more for food, and some of us more for service. Well it just so happens that I'm a fan-tastic cook at home, so I go out more for service.  This time it was more about the people I was with, so I wasn't paying close attention, but our server was from space. She wasn't just spaced-out, she was literally descended from space. The food was good and I believe everyone got what they ordered, so that's two stars instead of one. That's where it ends, though. Every time she came to the table and interacted with us, after she left we kind of looked at each other wondering if we wandered into the set of Romy and Michelle.  The topper was when we asked for cappuccino after lunch and were told that the machine was broken. Way to grab hold of that customer experience for all it's worth, Mr. Tavern. Just to rub salt in our wounds, the server came back with the check and asked if anyone wanted coffee. Srsly? We confirmed the machine was broken and she informed us that Paradise Bakery was open. What? Do they even have cappuccino??  The crab cake sandwich is yum.

This place is very classy -- great decor and atmosphere.  The food is phenomenal. Starting with the pitas, hummus, main course, and Turkish coffee, everything was top-notch and far exceeding anything I've had from this genre of food. I'm not a lamb person but the chicken and beef were terrific.  A group of us went for lunch on a weekday and the lunch menu portions were large. I could easily have shared with someone. The service was slow -- it looked like they had two waiters covering the whole place. If you're in a hurry at lunch this might not be an ideal place. But, if you have time to loosen your belt and enjoy the atmosphere, check it out.

Overall, not worthy of all the hype.  I visited House of Tricks for a Friday business lunch. Although they didn't seem overly busy, everything was quite slow from the drink service through the food delivery to the process of getting the check. You know that part of the meal when all conversation is exhausted and everyone is glancing around wondering when they can go? You want your check before that point, usually.  The food is fresh-tasting but unremarkable. I had a Moroccan fruit and chicken shawarma salad. The dressing was OK but too little of it. The chicken was dry. The lettuce just seemed like garden variety (har har) boxed salad mix you would get from Costco or a food service. Pretty boring.  I won't be back.

Underwhelmed in almost every way.  I'll start with the good--the ambiance and decor is very nice. Sitting outside is relatively comfortable even in 90-degree whether. That's about where the niceness ends, though.  The service is painfully slow. My table sat down at noon. It was 12:20 before any of us saw drinks, and 12:50 before we saw any food. The refills were slow, table clearing was slow, the check was slow, etc. I just don't want to make a 90 minute investment in lunch, not even counting transit time. The waitstaff has essentially no personality--no friendly conversation, no check-ins, no nothing.  The food is rather atrocious. I ordered a tuna melt with sweet potato fries and mixed greens. The tuna melt was cold when it came out, and was so fatty and salty that I could barely eat it. The mixed greens, on the other hand, were for some reason warm. When greens are warmed, they wilt. The sweet potato fries were cold and limp.. absolutely disgusting. I should not be able to fold a piece of sweet potato in thirds without it breaking. I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.

Since there are more than enough reviews about the coffee, I'll add that the tea is very good here as well. The pastries are delicious and fresh. Overall the atmosphere is very comfortable but crowded. When we went there was an equal mix of single patrons on i-whatevers sharing tables, and large raucous groups.    Not a bad way to spend a rainy Saturday afternoon.

The good:  The location is very convenient to a lot of stuff you might do on the strip, to start. Although everything is under construction as of Oct 2015, which makes getting in and out a bit of a pain, you can access a lot just by walking. The dining selection is very good; there are several nice restaurants and many smaller things like Starbucks and Nathan's hot dogs. They have plenty of shopping if that's your thing. NY-NY souvenirs, plus themed shops like Hershey's World of Chocolate and Houdini's Magic Shop.  The casino itself seems to be very spacious and in good condition, offering a large variety of table games, electronic games, sports book, and more. There are bars around and plenty of stuff to keep you going all hours of the night including dueling pianos, Coyote Ugly, and much more. You could probably spend a whole weekend here and never leave the premises.   The less-than-good:  The room I got, a Park Avenue King, was just OK. The bed itself is good and very comfortable. Standard furniture and bathroom, nothing special. Lack of accessible outlets and newer light/climate controls gives this away as an older room. They've put a veneer of updates on it, but the whole thing needs remodeling and refreshing. Everything was pretty clean, but one of my pet peeves is hotels who still provide unwrapped drinking glasses in the bathroom. We have no idea where those have been or who cleaned them; please just give us a disposable cup in plastic wrap. At least we know it's clean, and not left from the last guest or wiped with a rag.   The bad:  The A/C unit in the room was noisy and inefficient, with an ancient thermostat and a loud metallic rattle. The shower temp dial was so hard to turn that I had to grasp it in a weird way and actually cut myself on the sharp edge underneath.  I don't think I met a single employee here that appeared to enjoy their job. The desk clerk at check-in was robotic and never smiled or addressed me by name. The attendants working the arcade and roller coaster looked like they could barely stand to be at work. Bored expressions, looking at their shoes, never smiling or interacting with guests. The dealers also looked glum and disinterested, even the ones who had guests and their tables. I went to another property and gambled where I got smiles and welcomes. Bad form, whoever hires these people.   I won't return because I can get a comfortable bed at any number of places on the strip. It's personal attention that makes the difference in this industry.

Unimpressed, sadly.  We stopped in for a nightcap on a Friday night and it was fairly busy. Everyone was clustered in front around the live music, and there were empty seats in the back and up in the balcony. We tried up there first, and after wondering aloud for 5 minutes, "Do you think there is any service up here?" we decided the answer was no and hiked back down. We then had to head for the back, where it quickly became clear why no one was sitting back there: The whole area smells like a urinal cake owing to its proximity to the restrooms.  A waitress came over and my associate asked about their Irish Whiskey selection. Safe question, no? Well, she looked horrified and proceeded to stumble through a list of 3 or 4 before admitting she didn't know the other ones. This is a place that advertises its Irish Whiskey... ho hum. My associate ordered one he recognized and I ordered a Guinness. We also ordered an "onion pile" to share. Sounds huge, right? Woot!  I'm afraid the Guinness was the only thing that didn't disappoint. She brought something in a whiskey glass that definitely wasn't whiskey; my associate sent it back while she explained it was "on the ticket". She was really nice, and I felt bad for her, because she was clearly not trained on listing or, indeed, visually identifying whiskey. The onion pile was a scrappy collection reminiscent of Burger King. Aye.  Maybe an off-nite for the place or the waitress or both, but I shan't be recommending it again.

Friendly service and interesting breakfast creations--can't ask for much more than that! I enjoyed some of the little touches such as putting a carafe of coffee and a pitcher of ice water on the table. It's nice to be able to refill your drink whenever the mood strikes you instead of waiting for a server.   Although it was a weekday, the restaurant was pretty crowded (including a large group that seemed to be doing some kind of event in their own room) and the servers looked harried. However, we didn't have to wait too long for the food or for the check when the time came.

Much better value for your money and much better service available elsewhere, even in the hipster doofus paradise which is the Scottsdale Fashion Square.  I should have known we were in trouble when I noticed an onion ring tower sitting in the kitchen area as we walked in, which subsequently disappeared when we ordered one ten minutes later. The server was very nice but overly agreeable and acted like everything we ordered was his favorite thing; I don't think he knew much about the beers or pairings. I probably could have ordered a Reichschwagger Golden Bandito which he would agree was the best beer on the menu until returning a few minutes later to inform me it's not something they carry.  The main dishes were pretty good, but didn't make up for the patchy service and disgustingly lukewarm appetizer.

Despite working about a mile away from this place for 7 years, I've never gone inside, mostly because I'm scared of places that are the only operational business in an entire plaza of empty stalls. I always think they must be moving counterfeit Matchbox cars out the back door or something.  But, I was at Pavilions for the car show and we decided to go to this joint. The hostess was super friendly, and set us up to go down the line. Tons of raw meats, very cold or frozen, and tons of fresh veggies and sauces. There is a huge board that tells you how to mix up various kinds of sauce. You can really pack a lot of meat and toppings into those bowls, even if you get the "regular". And don't worry about mounding it on there, because it all reduces when they cook it.  It is true that they throw water on the grill while cooking and I think this must temper the taste somewhat. I put tons of garlic on mine and I barely tasted it when I got back to the table. So, minus one star for that. But I'd rather water than butter, which is what you get at some places.  The price includes a drink, rice, soup, and some different toppings they have available after your stuff is cooked. We left stuffed and happy, so it's all good.

It's hard to beat the whole IKEA atmosphere and shopping experience. I still get a whiff of excitement when I step into the showroom -- less so than when I first set foot in the new store, but it's still there. Maybe it's the heady aroma of particle board, golf pencils, meatballs, and screaming kids waiting in line for Smland... not sure?  The upstairs showroom is really the best part of IKEA. They change it up enough that it's interesting on repeat visits. If I ever get crammed into a 300 sq ft living enclosure in Prague, I'll be all set as far as decorating ideas. The restaurant is still cool. Shame people can't seem to get on board with the whole "clear your own table" thing, because there are always messes around when I go there. Where else can you get lingonberry soda though, really.   One lingers in the showroom because you know that somewhere in the distant future you have to get to the downstairs part where you actually buy stuff and lift hundreds of pounds of flat, wide boxes into your cart and eventually your vehicle. They design the boxes this way so you can fit them in your Peugot or MINI, despite the fact that most Americans have more cargo space than your average Boeing 747. Frankly, I'd rather the boxes be shaped like dumbbells or body bags so at least I can lift something I've had practice with.  Oh, IKEA. Here is where you lose a star. The self check-out is absolutely revolutionary but it cannot dominate the commerce area. You have one full-service checkout for the absolutely soulless but everything else is self. I love it personally, because I can get out of there without the faffing and inane chatter that goes along with interacting with a clerk. But the masses simply cannot or will not bring their A-game when it comes to the scanners and payment devices. It requires a delicate symphony of grabbing merch, getting those lasers lined up right, bagging, paying. Lasers! People cannot merge onto I-10 correctly, let alone cope with lasers.  At least create Expert, Intermediate, Beginner, and Hopeless lanes so we can self-identify and get out of Dodge.

I haven't eaten a meal here for a long time, so I'm reviewing just the nightlife aspect of the place. It is divided roughly into a restaurant on one side and a bar/live music area on the other.  The live bands they have in here are very good, and not too loud, so if you want to enjoy some live music and still be able to have a conversation, this is a good place. There is also a large outdoor patio area with a bar. The bands I've seen here tend toward R&B, Motown, Blues, and similar genres.  The service seems very friendly and, as another reviewer mentioned, the whole place tends toward the upscale. If you've heard rumors that this is a "cougar" bar, I'd say that's pretty accurate. You won't see many folks under 40 here.

First time up to Cave Creek today, and I swung by this place to meet some biker friends and grab some breakfast.  Really friendly people, really good joe, REALLY good Big Ass and Half Ass burritos. Chorizo and avocado, homemade salsa. If I were Homer, I'd be drowning in a puddle of my own saliva right now. They roast their own coffee, and the house dark was fantastic.   Did I mention the people are friendly? Not just the people that work there--while I was sitting on the front porch, enjoying the mountain views, and eating my grub, no fewer that a dozen random people walking by said hello. A few of them said "have a safe ride" and so on. I practically want to move to Cave Creek just based on two hours sitting there.  Easy stop on Cave Creek road if you're passing through. Yum... I might just be back tomorrow for another burrito.

It seems that this was a nice theater, say, 6-8 years ago. However, the owners have clearly not spent any time or money on keeping it nice.  As mentioned in previous reviews, the parking situation at this entire plaza a somewhat comical. The engineers decided to make about half of the spots "compact" and they are marked so--but maneuvering into them even with my VW Rabbit is tricky. Trickier still since the "compact" designation is roundly ignored by your average Ahwatukee citizen driving his Super Duper Nissan Dreadnought or what have you. Then, you have the scene kids in zooped-up Honda Civics using the valet parking in front of the theater while they go to Harem.  When you enter the lobby, everything appears to be pretty nice. The people are nice as well. However, the facade doesn't hold up once you get inside the individual theaters. They smell bad, the chairs are horribly broken and stained, and sometimes it seems that the staff has completely given up the notion of cleaning the theater between shows. I've gone to matinees where I literally had to move garbage off seats (from the previous show) onto the floor to sit down. The management allows mobs of underage Ahwatukee brats into R-rated movies, making pretty much any popular movie unwatchable after 7 pm.

Wow. So I drive past this joint all the time and go, "A local bar. I should go in some time." I realize they are active on Twitter and whatnot, which is really cool.  Tonight I finally made it down there after tweeting to them to leave a TV on the Coyotes game for me. Not only did they do that, but the dude that apparently monitors the social media for CK's was actually expecting me and introduced himself to me. Do you get this kind of personal treatment at most any other place?  No, you certainly do not. It's like a modern-day Cheers, except no Woody, which is actually a positive. I always hated Woody.  Good food, good brews--they have Molson Canadian on tap, which earns them an extra-special place in my heart. Nice people. What else does a bar need?

It's been quite a while since I was at CK's, but I stopped in with a friend to watch a basketball game and I'm glad to say everything here is still top-notch.  The service is friendly and very efficient, as others have mentioned. The servers seem to be there when you need them without being intrusive, which is the thing every server should shoot for. The food remains good as well--I finally got a chance to try the raspberry chipotle sauce and it is excellent! Lots of local beers on tap as well.  CK's is definitely a sports bar and they have a lot of nice TVs around showing any sporting event that's on TV. It's quite a social place as well, and there are many groups of regulars that frequent the patio area and the bar area.

My family has visited this hotel several times, always on holiday weekends. As such, it's always busy. Overall, the property seems to handle crowds well, and problems are usually dealt with appropriately. The grounds are beautiful and the The Falls area is fantastic for just hanging out for the day. Kids love it - two huge pools and a water slide. When the companion resort, the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak, is not at full capacity, you can also take a shuttle to that property and enjoy their pool area with lazy river.  Our last stay was over July 4 weekend, and it was busy as usual. We rented a cabana at the pool area. They are worth every penny! You don't have to jockey for shade all day, and they include TVs, telephones, and a small fridge with water bottles. They are always booked up, so call ahead and reserve one when you make your reservation. We had a small issue where our reservation wasn't written down correctly on one of the days, but The Falls manager resolved it instantly. Great service. Don't let her catch you with outside food or beverages in those cabanas though! I think I saw her behead someone. On busy weekends, the poolside restaurant/bar pumps out food and alcohol at a frantic pace, but the service is always efficient and friendly. They do tack on 20% if you order right to your cabana or lounger via the roaming waitstaff. Give them a break though -- you're on vacation and they're sweating a gallon per minute to serve you.  The restaurants on the property are adequate but overpriced, like any resort. Drive a 1/4 mile north on 7th St to Safeway, AJ's, or Fresh & Easy and stock up on groceries. We always have our room full of outside food/drink with no complaints from the hotel.  We love the rooms because they have a separate front room with pull-out bed. Great for the kids and provides some privacy/quiet for the back bedroom if someone needs to pass out early. They're not exactly lavish, but you're not there to sit in your room, right?  I give 4 stars rather than 5 for two reasons. First, the parking is a royal pain in the butt; they have nowhere near enough parking for all the guests when at capacity. If you are in one of the upgraded rooms up in the hills, be prepared to navigate down a narrow road with SUVs lining both sides, and a decent chance you will be blocked in by someone. The fire marshal would have a field day. Either that or park in the main lot and hoof it all the way up to your room. Second, they shut everything down at around 9 PM, leaving all the adults on the property to either walk around in circles in their rooms or drive into Phoenix to locate some nightlife. This place seriously needs a bar to stay open late on weekends.

A nice diversion! A tad difficult to find amidst all the little businesses back behind Fry's, but well worth it.  The shop is quite cozy, shall we say... only 4 or 5 indoor tables and we took the last one. It has a nice atmosphere though and the people working there are friendly. Some Vermont subculture was imported for your viewing pleasure.  Sandwiches=good! I got the Long Trail and the combination of flavors was just perfect. There are a lot of ingredients on that thing, which makes for a tricky balancing act (flavor-wise, and holding the sandwich-wise) but they nail it quite well. I'm always leery of pickles overpowering the whole sandwich but they are really just complementary to the house-roasted beef and other stuff.  The only "area of opportunity" I see is that they could really improve things a notch by using fresh bakery type bread. When I asked how big the sandwiches are, the guy held up a bag of commercial bread that you'd find in the grocery store aisle--seems a little odd considering their emphasis on fresh ingredients. If you don't want to bake your own bread, maybe strike a deal with a local bakery?  Overall very tasty, fresh, and won't break the bank. Will return to explore other options.  P.S. Vermont guys: For Pete's sake, grab the nearest English major and have them go through your web site. :P

I really couldn't ask for anything more... from a tire store. I mean, free cognac and dancers on poles would be nice, but these guys are here to move some rubber and that's what they do.  They are efficient and professional--I brought my car in for four tires and I was out in under an hour. They do offer many other services, but I politely declined. I like that they ask first though--I hate taking my car in for one specific thing only to have the salesperson come back with a list of other unrelated items they are more than happy to handle for me. Just tires, thanks. They also present several options for tires, and don't just try to stick you with the most expensive ones while pretending they don't have anything cheaper. Again, kudos!  The thing that impressed me the most was that it turned out they only had three of the tire they sold me--so the manager upgraded me to the next level of tires for no additional cost. The tires now on my car were $20 more/ea than the ones I paid for.  Good people here--perhaps I'll return for other services.

Going a bit against the grain with this one, but...  On the surface, this Fry's is as good as the next. It's clean and well-stocked. The people "in the back" are clearly doing their job and well.  However, the "front line" is really what makes or breaks a place, if you ask me. Each time I've been here since I moved to the area, I've had problems checking out. The place is slow. The checkers move slowly, and the baggers move slowly. I've only experienced the weekday crew, so maybe the whole vibe changes when the evening and weekend people clock in.  I can forgive "slow", and I've usually forgotten it before I'm halfway to the car. However, one particular incident the last time I visited this store really stuck in my craw. I absolutely cannot stand listening to employees badmouth "they", AKA other employees or even the people that sign their paychecks. The cashier for my line was having trouble scanning things, and blaming the meat department ("THEY cannot stick proper barcodes on things, hence I cannot scan them.") Then the customer in front of me had purchased something enclosed in a security device... more problems ("THEY only do this to slow me down. I don't know who would steal this."), and so on.  Also, the bagger smashed all my produce under cans. You'd think bagging groceries is some kind of art form that humanity hasn't yet mastered...  Anyway, perhaps some believe that recreational complaining and smashed produce are all in a day's work at Fry's and I shouldn't complain, but I think it's downright unprofessional. An otherwise pleasant shopping experience shouldn't end like this.

Things have gotten a lot better at this Fry's over the years.  The selection is still great, and it has gotten even better. They have recently expanded their "health food" section to include selections that rival places like Whole Foods and Sprouts. They have lots of food for people with various dietary needs like gluten allergies, dairy allergies, and so on. They also have a rather extensive selection of alcoholic beverages for a grocery store--probably double that of nearby Safeway and Trader Joe's.  The service has gotten better as well. The front end manager does a good job keeping appropriate lanes open for the business of the store, and there are plenty of service clerks for bagging. They must draw straws to see who has to get carts outside, because the parking lot is always swarming with empty carts--not good if you don't fancy your car getting dinged up by a rogue cart blown into motion by the wind. Park far away!

This little place does a great job pumping out fresh Chinese food. It won't really blow you through the wall into the Avis rental office next door, but it's above average. Thus far we've tried several of the chicken and veggie dishes--they are all very good. The Garlic chicken and Mongolian chicken are favorites. Pei Wok makes everything fresh to order. There are a few clean, small tables you could sit at to eat (I think two two-tops and one four-top), but I always get it to go.  There are smaller lunch combos for a very cheap prices--cheaper even than going to Panda Express which is relative garbage. For dinner, you can get a "Large" which is just white rice and entree, or you can get the "Combo" which is fried rice, entree, egg roll, and cream cheese wontons. Look, maybe a better semantic strategy was in order, but they do what they can.  The guys running the joint are also very nice and friendly. They always banter with me about my tattoos, the weather, or anything else that comes up.

Amy's is a true "gem" in Casa Grande, a city where a lot of people would just as soon step on your face as look at you.  The shop itself has a great selection of what looks like quality jewelry, although I'm no expert. I wouldn't know a brilliant pear cut from a cubic macaronium. However, the service here is first-class. I have come in several times to make small purchases or get repairs. The staff is friendly, efficient, and clearly interested in the customer experience.   I mark a business like this by how they treat the small fries -- if I get great service when I come in to make a $50 purchase, I will give them the big sale when it's time. They understand this concept -- kudos to them.

The days of being dragged to Sears by your mother in ugly sweaters and suffering for two hours only to wait a month to get your photos back are over. This is an excellent place to get portraits for your kids or for the whole family, and they make some pretty impressive use of technology to make a great experience for everyone.  How it works: You show up and you are assigned a photographer who will work with you for different poses, different outfit changes, and so on. They are very good with children and I've seen them wrangle some pretty difficult little kids into great poses and happy smiles. They are good with older kids as well and know how to have everyone laughing. They even had my 18-year-old giggling. After they take tons of photos, they load them all up on a computer and guide you through the process of picking and discarding various photos. It sounds overwhelming, but they show them in groups of three and it's very manageable. They also edit and crop them on the fly, which is really neat to watch. After you've narrowed down your selection somewhat, they begin explaining what packages are available and what options you can pick.  After the first round of eliminations, you will still have photos amounting to $500-$600, since each pose is $20 and comes with 3 sheets of photos. This is where you have to be careful--keep thinning out the poses until you have the number you want and are happy with the amount you are spending. Their system is pretty ingenious, since you don't pick which photos you want--you pick which photos you DON'T want. As such, it's easy to end up with too many. Just remember to keep eliminating them until you have what you want.  You will then have all your prints along with a CD of digital versions of each photo, if your package included that, within 30 min. Pretty amazing.  Ask for Amber H. -- she's the best!

I registered for the Beginner course here after several recommendations from experienced riders. I was/am getting into the scooter or motorcycle market and took the advice that it's best to figure out one's confidence level before buying.  Boy am I glad I took this course!  There are a variety of schedule configurations you can sign up for, but I took one that met all day Saturday and Sunday. The morning hours were classroom instruction, culminating in a written exam. The afternoon hours were riding, culminating in a skills evaluation. Passing those allows you to waive the testing requirements at the MVD to get your motorcycle license or endorsement.  That's really the least of the benefits, though. The instructors were fantastic--really knowledgeable and positive people. Hell, fun to be around, even. They use an incremental approach to get your confidence up and build slowly up to riding. Before you know it, you're cruising all over the course, turning, swerving, weaving, braking, and so on. They teach you all kinds of stuff you would never figure out on your own. Did you know there are at least three methods of turning a motorcycle depending on speed and situation?  The other students were cool as well, for the most part. Mixture of experienced riders, new riders, younger, and older. Of course, the sportbike kids who talked about all their awesome riding experience, how light and powerful their bikes are, etc. are the ones who dropped bikes on the course and had trouble passing objectives.  On the way out the door, I has already discarded the notion of buying a scooter (unsafe at the speeds I would travel) and was confident of my ability to ride a basic motorcycle without killing myself.  Worth the price? Unquestionably. How much is your life worth? Surely more than $200.

Top-notch customer service here!  I didn't use the self storage, but I rented a Penske truck from this location. From start to finish, the communication was great and the service was exceptional. When I arrived the morning of the rental, the owner had it parked outside for me and everything was ready to go. He verified the condition of the truck, explained the best practices for driving it, and even threw in some free furniture pads. I had requested a hand truck and it was already in the truck. All the equipment was in top-notch condition.  This experience stood in sharp contrast to the times I have rented from U-Haul or Budget. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this location.

This is a really great place to get a haircut. The staff are very friendly and you get a lot for your $15, as Ian mentioned in his review. I've never had to wait when I went in, no matter if it was first thing in the morning or during the after-work rush hour.  Bring cash.

My experience at this place has changed quite a bit the last two times I've been there.  Both times, the only free barber has been a guy at the very end. I know some people wait for their "preferred" barber but I just take whoever is available because my cut is very simple. This guy is nice, but both times he's been sitting in his own barber chair eating a full-on meal when I walked in. So he'll set down his food nearby and start cutting hair, which seems kind of weird or unsanitary to me. Plus, I have to smell his food the whole time I'm sitting there. His station is also very unsanitary, with lots of other people's hair on the floor and even on the chair. It was quite noticeable when I was there on 11/16/2012. I guess I thought it was common for barbers to clean up their stations between customers.  The other barbers here are nice and professional, but unfortunately this guy is dragging the place down.

I wish I could say something about the food served here, but unfortunately, I was never served food.  I walked in one afternoon and it was deader than disco. A cashier was counting money in a drawer, and a large amount of cash was visible. A cook was bumbling around in the kitchen area, moving things around and doing busy work. I stood at the counter for a good five minutes while the counting was occurring, not wanting to speak and possibly mess up this accounting operation. However, when the lady was done, she looked up at me, then turned and started doing other things.  I just walked out at this point.  Oh, and their customer service infrastructure is broken too -- I submitted a web form telling about my experience and never heard anything back. Maybe they should bring back Carl's Sr -- Junior doesn't seem to be up to the task.

I had high hopes for this place due to the beautiful surroundings and great reviews, but our experience was below average. This is definitely a busy spot so we made a reservation for 6. When we got there, we were told that they didn't have a table available for our party, so we could cram into a table for 4 or wait. We just took the small table. It took around 10-15 minutes for a server to approach us, though she was quite nice. We placed our order and waited for quite a while.  The food was just OK. It was nice and fresh, but lacking much taste or creativity. The eggs, potatoes, and sausage were cooked without any seasoning. Take some fresh local ingredients and dump them on a flattop until cooked.... OK, they won't taste too bad because they're fresh, but they won't taste great either. I ordered the Cowboy Breakfast--two eggs over easy with chili. Very, very bland, and the beans were not cooked enough. I had to dump a sea of hot sauce on my plate to even taste anything.  They are also a bit tricky with their drinks. When they seat you, they will tell you to help yourself to a drink station that features lemonade, iced tea, and and coffee in huge decanters. They don't explicitly say you are being charged for these drinks, but when the check comes, you'll discover that the server has tallied up every cup at your table and charged you $3.50 each. A bit underhanded, if you ask me.

Lordy, I really hate this place. I'm using the word "hate" about a restaurant.  I really want to have a good time here. I have friends and co-workers that go here all the time. Mike, loyalty is a virtue, and I respect that. I'll never get what you see in this restaurant, though. It all looks so promising. Good location, busy professionals bustling in and out, free wifi!   The microcosm all shatters after that.  First off, as another reviewer mentioned, the line is straight out of junior high. You walk over, grab a tray, and then proceed to an utterly befuddling system of pre-made food, people making food, people waiting for pre-made and yet-to-be-made food. What the heck is going on in this line? I want a half sandwich and cup of soup. They have no sandwiches made, so they give me a giant number on a metal pole. I proceed to the logjam of people waiting for custom salads to be made. Do I go around them to get my soup? Do I wait? Some people seem to be waiting.   Someone asks me if I need soup. I open my mouth and manage, "I---" when a lady behind me shouts, "Cup of lemon chicken orzo!" Oh, you. You know the lady. Smart ponytail, pointy nose, voice that destroys and overrides every other sonic frequency.  Oh, people cut me. YES. Junior high. People are taking cutsies, for the love of Pete. People in skirts and people in ties. I realize that I've gone to the same place for lunch as salespeople and HR representatives who drive black Hummers and black Yukons with black Cardinals license plates, flicking cigarettes out the windows and failing to signal lane changes as they go. And they're cutting me in line. How did my judgment get so clouded?  Now someone hands me my sandwich and takes back my giant number. I am now at the cashier. Another bottleneck. The people here have no money handling skills--they are handed legal tender and they inspect it as if someone gave them kroner and they're mentally performing a currency conversion. Five more minutes go by, and my toes are getting numb from standing in line. Do I have a (mumble) card? No, no. Whatever it is, I don't have it, and I don't want it. I'll never be back here.  I get to the drink station and more people cut me as I try to set my tray down and get tea. I realize I overshot the silverware and try to step back that way. Someone heads me off at the pass and takes the last FOUR soup spoons.  I finally sit down and attempt to enjoy a few minutes of solitude. I'm in the north room. After 70 seconds, a woman asks me if I'd like to try some Thai salad. I decline, and hear card shuffling. I'm not in a dining room, I'm in a card room. Women are playing bridge or rummy or cribbage and they are laughing raucously. The uniquely annoying sounds of metal-footed chairs being drug across a tile floor reverberate through my eardrums as other women prepare to turn the room into a mahjong parlor. One of them dumps a whole box of mahjong tiles on a comically small table and they laugh as the tiles tinkle to the floor.  Somewhere next to me a guy's giant number on a metal pole tips over and clangs to the floor. Someone asks him if he's seen a set of Yukon keys.

This is a nice place -- the service is normally good and the staff is very friendly. The location is great because it is walking distance for some of the offices in the area and there are not many other offerings unless you want to hoof it all the way down to Scottsdale Rd.  The Doubletree Wally's is also in what I consider to be a cursed location. There have been several restaurants in and out of there that have all failed spectacularly. I approached Wally's with caution but I was rewarded with great food and great service. They are sometimes slow, and a couple of their menu items are questionable (some shredded BBQ burger nightmare comes to mind), which is my only reason for not giving 5 stars. The fish and chips are fab.  They also have a take-away menu of salads and sandwiches that are ready to go by the front door if you work in the area and forgot your lunch. They're above average and a great value. Forget Subway or Paradise Bakery!

Freakin' cool! Incredible value... huge breakfasts for under $10. Everything I've had so far has been prepared well--great way to start the day, no matter who you are.  The servers are friendly and come around constantly with refills. I've been there with larger groups as well, and they handle us with grace and professionalism.  Kudos. Will be back!

I'm sad to say that The Place has gone very much downhill since their move to a bigger location. I've given them a few chances hoping it was just growing pains, but it's taken way too long to get back on their game.  I am part of a regular group that used to go here every Friday morning. We always sat on the patio of the old place and always got the best service. Super friendly, fast coffee refills--they were just ON.  After they moved across the street, they began to make it clear that they would not be accommodating our group. They wouldn't set up a table for us and tried to shove us into individual booths, even when there were only 5 or 6 of us. They have a "back room" with larger tables that they wouldn't open at the time we got there (~6:00am) claiming staffing issues. They finally and begrudgingly let us back there along with several other larger groups facing a similar circumstance; we were basically ignored. They might has well just told us to our faces that they would not be serving us as a group and saved us all the trouble.  Don't read between the lines here--we are not a loud, annoying, or demanding group. We are just some guys that like to get together at breakfast.  Sadly, our concerns were not heard or passed on to anyone who cared, so I doubt we will ever be back. We've since moved on to places that will gladly accept our business.

Really nice concept!  Like a lot of other places in Scottsdale, it tries to be a bit more hip than need be, but I guess you have to play to your audience. The decor is interesting but definitely form over function. I felt like I did the time I accidentally sat in a chair at a modern art gallery that was actually meant to be an exhibit.  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, it's a tad annoying that the diet cola comes in a little glass bottle, basically preempting the possibility of any refills. As a diner, I like that soda to flow and flow. It's my method of portion control. It's not cute, at all. It's just annoying. So, minus one star for the uncomfortable decor and little glass bottles.  The rest of it was an easy "A". The sliders are awesome and there is enough variety to suit anyone (other than my vegan brothers and sisters, holla!). We also got an order of tots which was plenty to share. If you're a light eater, definitely do not order more than two sliders. But, if you're a might peckish or William "Refrigerator" Perry, go for three or more.  Actually, if you're The Fridge, get four or five.

Echoing the other reviews--as far as hair-cutting value, you can't beat this place.  The barbers are courteous and professional, and it's damned cheap. I got to watch World Cup soccer while I got my hair cut on my own little TV. There is a hot towel treatment, straight razor neck shave, and shoulder massage. The massage in my case was with one of those motorized massagers you used to see at Sharper Image, not a hand massage.  Did the fact that you get all this for $16 sink in yet?  Get over there, ya shaggy rascal!

I'm happy to say that, after 3 years, the level of service here continues to impress and amaze. They have a bit of a rotating staff--the only two barbers still working here since the first time I went are the owner and a very nice lady from Albania. Everyone here does top-quality work, so it doesn't really matter who you get.  The shop is very clean, and they accept credit/debit cards.

Really nice place in the apparently now-buzzing downtown Chandler area.   I went with a group at around 11pm on a Friday night and got fantastic service. The beers are pretty good, although the portions are on the small side. They seem much less than a proper pint. I tried the stout and the red, and both were tasty albeit fairly benign.  I didn't try the food, but someone in my group ordered wings about 15 minutes before the kitchen closed and they were very friendly about that. Some places will grumble when you try to order food that close to the buzzer.  Great ambiance and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.

I love Whole Foods. I take my kids here once a week at night to grab dinner and we can all get something healthy and fresh. The selection of food here, both ready-to-eat and packaged, is phenomenal. The prices are competitive unless you really buy the premium stuff, so there are a lot of choices.  The employees are knowledgeable and will help you find stuff. Many of them can spout off all kinds of information about their area of specialty. Think you can call a Safeway asking for some weird kind of apple, and not only have the produce manager know the growing season and geography of that apple, but offer to call you when they get it in? No, no, y no. Call Whole Foods, for sure.  Every time I've asked for something at Whole Foods, they go above and beyond. Last night I asked for corn syrup, and an employee practically hurdled the customer service counter in their haste to help me find it. They looked genuinely sorry that they didn't have it.  Also, they have a liberal return policy. This is good in case a naive and overambitious consumer accidentally buys a really smelly cheese and stanks up his car with it and then wants to return it just for being a huge mistake. Not that I know anything about that.  Anyway, you can't go wrong here.

This place is the pits.  There are no supplies in any of the racks unless you want to send something Express Mail. All of the Priority Mail stuff is constantly gone and they don't have any more. Not that there's anyone to stock the racks even if they did.  People used to leave reviews complaining that there were "only two" workers. Those days are long gone--there is now ONE counter person at all times. That means if you get behind someone that has questions, or can't understand a customs form, or wants to argue about mail being held, you are just stuck.  Why not use the automated machine, you ask? Because its printer has been broken for two weeks and you can't actually print the postage that you might buy. Not that there's a sign telling you this--you have to spend a few minutes going through the process only to be told at the end that the transaction can't be completed because the printer isn't working.  I know they are making cuts because they are out of money, but it's a vicious cycle they'll never get out of because they've now effectively made it impossible to patronize the postal service.  Stay far, far away.

Overall this is a very nice facility and a great place to work out.  The people are very friendly, from the staff to the people that work out there. I've never had an issue with anyone being rude or inconsiderate. The equipment is up-to-date and generally in very good working order. I go 3 times a week and I rarely see a machine out of order for more than a few days before it gets fixed. They have tons of classes that are included in your membership. Yoga, zumba, spin, step training, all kinds of other crazy stuff I don't know about, but it's there if you want it.  At peak times there can be a bit of jockeying for the latest and greatest equipment, but generally it's not an issue. They recently sent out a notice that they are upgrading and adding more machines, so they are definitely keeping up with demand. The only real issue that annoys me is that a lot of the people using the circuit weight machines ignore the signs asking that you vacate the machine while you are resting between sets. Some people will sit there for 5-10 minutes or longer between sets, which is inconvenient if you are working your way through the circuit. I don't blame the YMCA for this--all you can do is put up signs and hope people will be considerate.

Great place to bowl with the family!  These lanes do have the typical bar attached, but I got the feeling they are very family-oriented. We did not have any coupons when we went, and the guy at the counter was kind enough to let us use a coupon they had at the desk. We got two hours of bowling for four people, plus shoe rental and a pitcher of soda, all for $40. A pretty good deal for a Saturday.  Nice people, nice clean place, and non-smoking.

Kyrene Lanes has refreshed the facility and it remains a really great place to go bowling. Everything is in good working order and quite clean, including the tables and chairs and the bathrooms.   We went on a Monday so it wasn't very busy--just a senior league playing on some of the lanes and a few families. The guy made an effort to set us away from the groups of kids and give us plenty of space. One of the things I like about this place is they have very nice house balls, all color coded and organized. I've been to many bowling alleys where the house balls are people's old balls that got sold or traded in to the pro shop, so they are mismatched and in poor condition. Kyrene Lanes has what appear to be stock house balls from Brunswick.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the music is cheesy as heck and the pitchers of beer are cheap. Don't go without a coupon!

I am very happy with the service delivered by this company. Communication was very prompt and courteous. Scott arrived as agreed and was very friendly and efficient. My car is three years old with 120,000 miles and it's sitting in the driveway right now looking like it did the day I drove it off the lot. I would not hesitate to recommend Showcase.

This place is great and a lot of fun. We ventured over here on a whim because we were waiting for a show at the Rhythm Room across the way and the traditional Rack Shack BBQ was closed and locked.  The decor is quite fantastic and this little joint has a cool vibe. I was a bit guarded because it looks like the kind of place that might spring cheesy Ed Debevic's antics on you at any minute. But.. the guys were just cool.   One of the guys in my party is on a low-carb diet and the proprietor was very accommodating, making menu suggestions and whatnot. I got the Magic Mushroom Burger, another person ordered the Fat Ass Burger but what ended up in the bag was the Hot Ass Burger, and the low-carb person got a Greek burger with no bun. We all got the meal deal which is simply phenomenal at the $5 price point. You can't even get a crappy meal at McD's for that price any more. The burgers were absolutely awesome, and the fries were perfect.  There are bar stools inside and out in the the front. If you go around back, there are a couple larger booths by the parking lot. I wouldn't go back there again because a lot of people were standing around smoking and there was some tough-guy "Oh yeah? Well I'll kick your ass!" exchange going on behind the business next door. Give it a rest, guys. The proprietor did come around back and ask us how everything was, which was cool. I'd recommend to anyone.

We had a great experience at Lowe's.  Our refrigerator took a dump so we'd been involved in somewhat of a fire drill to get a new fridge. We had already been to Home Depot (takes two weeks or longer to get delivery), Sears (not a great selection of units under $1000), Great Indoors (only stupidly expensive fridges), Costco (like one fridge in the whole store) and on and on.  We were starting to get pretty discouraged when we walked into this Lowe's. We were immediately noticed and engaged by Carol, who was working in the appliance area. We told her our needs and she showed us several models that fit. The best part is that most of them are in stock, right at that store. They have their own delivery drivers and everything is handled locally.  We picked out a unit and Carol confirmed they had it. The computer told her that the first available delivery date would be several days away. However, we had told her it was somewhat urgent, so she went out of her way to make sure the delivery was scheduled for the following morning. She paid lots of attention to detail and really made us happy.  And I'm a grumpy bastard, let me tell you.  The delivery was also smooth. They showed up on time, hauled out the broken fridge, and installed the new one. They were professional and thorough, taking time to remove all the packing materials, attach the handles, and so on. They took all the junk with them when they left. Score!  The best part is that the delivery and haul-away is free. No rebates needed, just free.  You'd be nuts to buy an appliance anywhere else!

Ended up here before a Rhythm Room show because, as always, Rack Shack has the world's most bizarre business model and you essentially have to guess when they might or might not be open. If they're not open, head east down Indian School a few blocks and catch Stacy's. Actually strike that. Try Stacy's first, because it's way better.  The place is simple and to-the-point. It has a true city vibe like you might catch in Chicago or New York. It's not a restaurant that tries to be anything it's not, or tries to "create" a vibe with kitsch and pomp. No, someone just put up a chalkboard to tell you what's to eat, and put down some tables to let you eat it.  The eats are good so far. I got the brisket sandwich and sweet fries. The meat was very tasty and the fries were fresh and crispy. My only real complaint is that condiments are nowhere to be found. I would have liked ketchup and extra sauce for my brisket, since it didn't have enough for my taste. A nice lady walks out to the tables continuously asking how everything is and collecting empty baskets--I asked her but she must have forgotten. I would suggest they put condiments out so customers can help themselves. My associate got the same sandwich but with fried pickles and okra. I was skeptical on the pickles but they are actually really good if you like pickles.  Overall, a great way to fill up before you hit the RR or Char's. It's not quite over-the-top ringy-dingy five stars, but it's muy bueno (oh snap, here comes Sheriff Joe).

Wow cool place! It was a toss up between this and Roy's Fusion; I'm glad I checked the reviews on Roy's to discover it is a "nice" place before I walked in there looking like "The Dude" and embarrassing everyone.   The tastes are amazing -- got the Luau Pork Plate with Rumbi rice and it was fantastic. Spicy sauces were flying everywhere. My wife got the fish tacos which were excellent also. Overall, a way better bang for your buck than, say, Rubio's.

Just OK.  I wasn't very impressed with the knowledge base of the guy working. I asked for type of cigar and he replied that he didn't think they had it, but directed me to the section for that manufacturer. They did indeed have it, in several varieties.  On brands that I keep track of, their prices on individual sticks are at least 25% higher than another local shop.  I also purchased a butane lighter from him, which he said he would fill. He put the most meager amount of fuel in it possible, and it ran out literally that same night. I had lit it a couple of times to test and adjust the flame strength (because, what man doesn't want to "test" the flame strength?) and it didn't even have enough fuel to light my cigar that evening.  I won't be back. Please have someone working that knows the stock from front to back, and who knows how to fill a lighter.

This place has decent food, but the service has really gone downhill lately. I visited recently and was looking forward to trying one of the microbrews they advertise prominently on the building, in menus, and so on. Nope, the microbrews are unavailable because of some equipment problem. In fact, all draft beer is unavailable. Seriously? How long does it take to tap a keg?  The food we ordered was okay but the rice and beans were not hot at all. Then, we ordered fried ice cream. It tasted like rancid fry oil, a taste that does not leave the mouth for hours, trust me.  The waitress took the dessert off our bill but was wholly uninterested in our concerns about the microbrew or the ice cream. I doubt the message that the fry oil needed to make its way into someone's biodiesel made it back to the kitchen. Overall, disappointing and I'll think twice before going back.

An update is long overdue, since I originally rated Arriba two stars. I've been back a few times since, and they have really made a lot of strides toward improving the food and the service.  The servers are more "on" these days, the food is better, and the overall experience is more satisfying. Tonight I had the Hatch Chicken Especial, which is extraordinarily spicy (it's the spiciest dish they make) and really damned tasty. Pair it with an amber or bock microbrew to temper the spiciness somewhat.

Arriba has been through a lot since I last reviewed it. The original owner passed away and that must have caused some chaos in the background. However, the quality and service here continue to shine. We are regulars--I hate to admit how many times I've been here, but I have an app on my phone that ever-so-helpfully keeps track and tells me whenever I visit.  Some things have actually improved since my last review--the food seems fresher, so there might have been a change in the strategy for pre-cooking certain items or ordering produce. The quality of presentation is also somewhat better. When things come out, they are piping hot and very well arranged. The table salsa is also better and more fresh tasting.  I still can't give Arriba the elusive fifth star because they continue to present themselves as a microbrewery despite the fact that 2 of their 3 microbrews are consistenly "broken" or otherwise unavailable. The one that is working is a skunky brew that tasted like bleach the last time I had it. Whoever they have on the premises doing the microbrews needs to get a new career. So, stay away from those.

I have to reiterate what other Yelpers have written and also thank them for this recommendation. I used this company to move from Casa Grande to Ahwatukee based on their strong reviews here, and they didn't disappoint.  From the start, they were extremely communicative and let me know exactly what to expect and when. They anticipated problem areas and asked questions designed to give me the best experience based on my needs. They took the time to set me up with the crew and equipment that would be the best fit.  The crew foreman called early on the appointed day and let me know when to expect them. They were right on time, at the beginning of the time block I was quoted (8:30 - 10:00 am) or perhaps even 15 minutes early. The three-man crew was efficient and professional the whole time. They asked questions and took great care of my stuff from start to finish. They do a lot of "extras" that put them over the top in my book, such a providing free wardrobe boxes that I was able to pack with clothes and have moved for no extra charge.   The wrap-up was fine -- no expected charges or problems. My crap was moved in a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable price. Nothing was broken or lost. I couldn't be happier.

They've done it again.  I've really nothing to add to my review from last year, but that I used them again and they were equally awesome. I hate moving just a little less than being eaten alive by Egyptian scarabs, but they really go the distance to make sure everything is squared away.  Nothing broken, nothing out of place, nothing lost.

Something about this place always told me to stay far, far away. But by all rights, all of us should try every Italian restaurant around, because someone, somewhere, must be nailing "Italian Restaurant", the triple-Axel of the culinary business. I just haven't found them yet.  I should have listened to my impulse to stay away, but my wife has been wanting to try this place for years. For some reason we thought we would forgo some risk by using the To Go service and ordering online. Nay, the problems this place has pervade all its crevices. all the way out to the parking lot.  I ordered some junk online: A small Caesar Salad, a Small Quattro al Forno, and a Small Eggplant Parmesan. It would be ready from 5:00-5:15pm. I got there at about 4:50 and a friendly lady came out right away and gave me the bill to sign. She said my food was "not quite done". Fine, cool, whatever. I was early. I could wait a few.  A half hour later, it would dawn on me that "not quite done" in restaurant parlance actually means "We haven't started cooking your food." After I watched numerous people park at the To Go window and leave with their food, the harried lady finally came back out with my stuff, explaining that "they had to cut more eggplant". Ah, the mysterious "they" and their lack of kitchen management skills. An order for eggplant comes in online at 4:30.. why cut up any eggplant? Silly.  I got home and discovered that the rest of my order had apparently been sitting around while the eggplant dish was prepared. The eggplant was moderately hot -- however, the Quattro al Forno was room temperature and so was the salad. The eggplant was way too thin and not seasoned well, and featured chunks of uneven Parmesan that had clearly been cut instead of grated. The Quattro al Forno might have been good when it was designed to be served, but its temperature made me quesy.  When all was said and done, I realized that I'd consumed passable Italian food at quite a premium price with poor service to go with it. I felt full of lukewarm food and disappointed, which is really a strange sensation. I'm sure this place has its moments when it's hitting on all cylinders, but it ain't Sunday at 5pm.

Extremely bizarre to roll up on this place and see exactly one vehicle in the parking lot, front or back. It's right off I-10, so you'd think more people would roll off for a bite. Whatever... I'm willing to take a few things on faith at my age.  The host/waiter/etc guy (I think there -had- to be a separate cook in the back, but I'm not sure) was efficient and professional. Everything was quick including ordering, serving, drink refills, and so on. I wouldn't go so far as to say he was friendly, but he wasn't unfriendly either. He just... was. Really, though, isn't that enough? Do we need intrusive or annoyingly perky servers?  The food was very good. My wife had the Pork Birria and I had flautas. The pork was cooked well and the sauce was delicious. The flautas were very good with nice fresh toppings. They have a good recipe for mexican rice as well. Portions were reasonable, as you can see from some of the photos.  Check this place out. It's worthwhile to support a local place that's doing good by its customers.

Went here New Year's Eve at the suggestion of some friends. The place was jam packed as expected, and we got seated in about an hour.   The general ambiance of this place is quite nice. One gets the impression of being in an establishment that's a considerable cut above your average steakhouse. Of course, to me, an average steakhouse is Outback so you might take me with a grain of salt.   I was a bit pessimistic because I'm never really satisfied with the steak I get anywhere. I may not have ever had a really great steak. However, the steak and the general level of service here far exceeded expectations. They had a New Year's menu that we all ordered off which included a salad, entree, seafood side, and dessert. I had the Caesar salad, the New York Strip, the Tiger Prawns, and a brownie dessert. All were terrific, and the steak was cooked perfectly. It was so tasty I almost wanted to ask it what it was doing next weekend.  There was only one negative, and I'll preface my account by saying I've been a bartender so I have a certain level of expectation there. One of our party ordered a Singapore Sling from the bar while we were waiting for our table. I'll grant that it's a bit of an oddball drink to order these days. The waitress disappeared for 15 minutes only to come back with, "Uh.. what's in a Singapore Sling?" I was a bit floored, and said, "Don't you have a copy of Mr. Boston's back there?" See, back in the day, if someone ordered a drink you didn't know, you looked it up and made it without saying anything. She looked at me and replied, "Mr. Bostons, haha!" in a way that simultaneously told me that the answer was "no" and that she had no idea what Mr. Boston's is. There is no bartending pride anymore, apparently. At least not at "The Keg".  Anyway, excellent food, excellent service, amateur bartenders. If you're after the first two and don't care about the third, give it a try!

Stopped here today for a quick takeout salad. It was really busy, with every table inside and out occupied. However, the staff was friendly and got my order out within a reasonable amount of time for being made to order - about 5 minutes. The food tasted fresh and somewhat above average, although there don't appear to be a lot of healthy offerings here. Most things come with fries, or are drowning in sauce or dressing.  The whole vibe of the place is like a Chicago dive, as Michael M. said. It's funny to go in places that serve gyros because they always have those stock "gyro" posters that they must get from the food service guy or something.

An Open Letter to Filiberto's:  I don't know what caused your franchising department to approve this location in Ahwatukee, but I'm really glad you did. Everyone loves deliciously decadent and insanely cheap Mexican food. You're not the best food out there--far from. But you don't pretend to be anything you're not. You unapologetically peddle your wares to us enlightened folks that eschew the crappy breakfast food served at virtually any other fast food place.  Oh, and thank you for giving me hot sauce no matter how I answer the question, "Do you want hot sauce?" Because even though I always say no, I always want it by time I get home. And you give it to me. I love you.  Sincerely, Andy G.

I can't speak to any of the post-breakfast food here but the breakfast is definitely very good for the money.  Is it any serious gourmet s*%t? Heck no. It's a nice big, hot breakfast for a very reasonable price. The staff is very friendly as well, especially to groups. No grumbling about multiple checks, seating, anything like that.   Try it out!

Just okay. Reminds me of an modestly upgraded college house party.  Lots of men with Blackberries yelling at televisions. Tepid, domestic pitchers. Frightening fish and chips... hard and tasteless. That applies to the fish, the chips, and also the coleslaw.  Friendly crew is about the only saving grace.

We've been really happy with Ah-So both times we visited.   The first time, we sat in the regular section and ordered sushi, which was  well-prepared and tasty. Admittedly, I am not a sushi expert, but if it tastes good and doesn't fall apart, I'm happy. The service was good on a busy Saturday night.  We went again recently on a Saturday afternoon during a "dead period". A few people were in the bar area, but the hostess was doing double-duty as a waitress. I was a bit worried that it might be slow, but no problem. She was friendly and quick. This time we did the teppanyaki table and it was great! The chef that came out was very friendly and skilled. We got steak, chicken, and scallops, all prepared perfectly. However, everything is cooked with a lot of butter, which gives it a rich butter taste that is not to our liking (or good health). My wife ordered a mixed drink from the bar that had absolutely no alcohol taste - I think we paid $9 for mostly pineapple juice. Be safe and order beer.   Overall, great place. I highly recommend it if you want to try sushi or the teppanyaki experience.

The one redeeming quality of this store is that -some- of their teas are quite good. If you are an earl gray fan, the earl gray creme makes a nice diversion from an "everyday" earl gray. The earl gray white is pretty good as well. The quality of their teas is middling at best, and they have an over-abundance of fruity blends that won't appeal to most serious tea drinkers.  The store itself is obnoxious. They have hawkers out front trying to lure passersby into getting samples of tea, which is annoying in and of itself to the point that I go out of my way NOT to walk by their store. Once you get inside, they are very aggressive about selling you large quantities of tea in overpriced containers. The rest of their merchandise is overpriced as well--if you are looking for any kind of kettle, tea mug, or other accessory, shop around before you pay Teavana's prices. As others have noted, make sure you pay close attention to how much tea they are ringing up and request a regular bag unless you want to be charged for the container. You do NOT need a pound of tea unless you are a fanatical tea drinker going through 10-12 cups a day. 6 ounces of tea is plenty for almost anyone.

Not all that good, all things considered.  I know one is begging for trouble when visiting a donut establishment 30 min before closing. A lot of the donuts were out of stock, which I have no gripe about. I don't exactly expect them to cook a whole bunch of fresh donuts at night when no one wants them. I do wonder what they do with the leftovers when they close, and two robust older men loitering in the lobby gave me a clue.  The whole vibe of the place was "we're closing soon" which bothers me quite a bit. Chairs up on tables, and the counter jockey managing to work the phrase "we're closing soon" into his first sentence to us. Right, I get it. But no, my experience should be the same as the person who came in at 7 am, sorry.  We got a dozen donuts from the paltry selection (it doesn't look like even at peak times they have that many different kinds of donuts) and even the ones we ate that same night tasted stale and gross. I got the sour cream donuts and they left a strange coating inside my mouth that took about 12 oz of scalding coffee to wash away. Yuck.  The only reason it isn't one-star is because I already somewhat lowered my expectations due to going at night. However, if as a business you don't want to give evening customers a 5-star experience, then just save us all the grief and close at noon.

Eva's is a longtime family-owned restaurant business that has operated a location on Sunland Gin Rd for years. They recently built and opened a new location on Pinal Ave in Casa Grande.  The first thing anyone would notice about the new location is the striking architecture and decor. There is a giant sculpture on the roof near the front entrance that is reminiscent of an onion dome but it is made of decorative glass and metal. The remainder of the building has other interesting decor and architecture; they really went all-out on this project and it shows. Words cannot do it justice. It's no Guggenheim, but it's definitely bound to become a Casa Grande landmark.  When discussing the food and service, I have to begin by contrasting it with that of the older Sunland Gin location. The older location is borderline notorious for its slow service (although the food is worth it) and none of the waitstaff ever seemed particularly friendly to me. At the new location, they seem to have developed a new system for cranking out fresh food (same recipes) and, lo and behold, hiring friendly and efficient staff. Believe me when I say that Casa Grande is not known as a hub of good customer service, so this is no small accomplishment. From the smiles that welcome you when you walk in to the waitstaff, everyone is... great. I've been to the new location about 20 times and I've never had a bad experience.  The food is exceptional. A lot of Mexican food is available in Casa Grande and the recipes at Eva's destroy all of it. Some of their house specialties can get a bit pricey, pushing the $20 price point. There are plenty of options for under $10, though. Since we have kids, I also judge a restaurant by their kids' menu--do they have some good, creative offerings there, or do they just shovel the same cheeseburger/chicken strips/mac 'n' cheese as everyone else? Eva's has an original and thoughtful kids' menu, and they will custom make anything you can describe. Does your rugrat want a tostada with guacamole, beans, and lettuce? No problem.  Eva's also has live entertainment on weekends in the form of roaming mariachi bands and then a DJ later at night. There is a full bar area, a full dining room, and a smaller separate dining room that probably can be reserved for parties. There is an outdoor seating area as well with an outdoor fireplace. It's all gorgeous. If you're ever passing through on your way to or from Phoenix and Tucson, do yourself a favor.

A fun night out can be had here!  My wife and I went on a Saturday night because we heard they have Team Trivia. When we arrived the place was quite busy because there was an NCAA playoff game going on. So, we sat and had a beer until the game was over and trivia started. It is not electronic trivia like you might be used to in some bars--they actually give you a pad of paper and they have a host reading out questions and collecting answers. I'm not sure if you actually win anything but it was fun nevertheless.  The beer selection is quite nice and they have several things you're unlikely to encounter elsewhere unless you really make a point to visit bars that have a lot of craft beers. The appetizers are pretty good as well--we tried the chips and salsa and one of their quesadillas.  This is definitely a dressed-down sports bar so don't put on your Saturday best for a night out here.

I have a vague memory of eating at a Macayo's in downtown Phoenix long ago and it being good. However, now their food is akin to any food service garbage you might eat at a school cafeteria.  Even worse, the service at this location is awful. We have tried it three times. The first time, we had a table of eight and we were left unattended for 10-15 minutes at a time. The second time, it was four of us, including two kids. The waitress was nasty to the kids and kept giving us the stink-eye. Our kids don't make messes and are very polite. The third time, we waited in the entrance for a full 10 minutes without being acknowledged by any staff. The bartender made eye contact with us several times but didn't offer to seat us or get the hostess. We just gave up and left, and won't be returning.

How does one measure a little donut shop? As far as I'm concerned, one measures it by the friendliness of the staff, and the availability of fresh, delicious donuts.  The family that opened this donut shop is amazingly friendly. I've been in there at traditional times (Saturday or Sunday morning) but also odd times like Friday night. They always have an incredible array of fresh donuts that are way better than the competition, in my view. Krispy Kreme can go home.

I visited this gym once as a guest and now twice to work out as a member. It's way more impressive than the surrounding competition (i.e. Pure Fitness) in terms of selection of machinery, customer service, and amenities.  First of all, they have any kind of machine you could ever want to work out on. They have things that I've never seen the likes of, looking like they'd spin you into the wall or chop your head off. However, the staff have made it abundantly clear that they are willing to show anyone how to use these things, so that's good. They have tons of cardio equipment, free weights, nautilus, balance balls, punching bags with gloves, etc. They have a large area for classes (included with membership), a basketball court, and a pool. Well it's snowbird season and the pool is full of seniors with snorkels, but god love 'em. When I'm that age all I'll be doing is sitting in a rocking chair, alternating between sleeping and spinnin' yarns.  I haven't tried out all the crap yet, but I'll get to it. It's like yodeling -- you can't just start out yodeling, you have to build up to it.  The staff is really nice. They provide a friendly greeting when you come in, and when you leave. The guys that signed me up for my membership said hi to me and asked me about my workout, which is cool. They already have the sale, so as far as I'm concerned, anything extra is great customer service. The sales guy even said he would call me if he didn't see me coming in to work out. I'm tempted to test him on this. They offered to connect me with a personal trainer to do a fitness assessment, but I declined this service. Trainers are too much of a mixed bag, and I'd rather do my own research and workout planning.  The amenities are fantastic, at least compared to other gyms I've been to like Pure Fitness and the YMCA. They have a jacuzzi, a sauna, a nice locker area with semi-private showers, and so on. Even if I wasn't working out, I would totally stop by here if I needed a shower and shave and couldn't make it all the way home. This place also has child care if you bring your curtain climbers with you, for a nominal fee.   The only thing I would like to see, that they don't have, is towel service. I guess this is offered at some locations, but not here. I have to bring my own towel and deal with it wet in the car and so forth. Do not like.  One other thing -- if you do decide to sign up here, remember that both the initiation fee and the monthly fee is negotiable.  Overall, I am really happy so far.

Vaqueros is ostensibly part of a chain, since I have seen them around other places. But make no mistake -- the people cooking here have a brand of their own that Casa Grande locals may recognize.  Vaqueros is fairly new. When I pass it in the morning, there are always people in the drive-through. I finally got curious enough to stop by for dinner take-out. They are indeed open from 5 am to midnight most days, serving up breakfast burritos in the morning hours.  It didn't take long looking at the menu to recognize that it is almost identical to the menu of a long-time hidden secret in Casa Grande that closed last year, Ruperto's. I had heard that the Ruperto's staff had opened or was opening a new restaurant, and this appears to be it. Many of the same dishes Ruperto's was known for appear on the menu at Vaqueros. The most distinct is the 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. The guacamole is unique and extremely good -- it is a favorite of my daughter's and she recognized it at once as being the same as Ruperto's. We also ordered carne asada tacos, and a burrito and enchilada combo -- all were great. The rice is awesome, but the refried beans could use a little work.  All in all, a great and quick stop on Pinal, which has a dearth of good restaurants. Feed your family of 4 for under $20.

Not all that good, unless you're drunk and cutting the rug, I guess.  My wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and it was a decent-sized crowd enjoying the nice weather. I perked up when the server told me it was happy hour. However, this is the lamest happy hour I've ever seen or heard of. $3 domestic bottles? What kind of happy hour is that? Who is charging more than $3 for a bottle of Bud Light even at the worst of times? And of course, I go through the normal shenanigans with the server as I ask for other bottles that are made in the US but somehow aren't included in the special. Fat Tire, etc. These are domestic, but no, you can't have them for $3.  I order the carne asade tacos: $10, no rice or beans. No chips on the table. The meat is very sparse, and the rest of the taco is mushy stewed tomato. The tortillas are mushy as well, and there is a sad sprinkling of lettuce in the middle of the plate that would barely be sufficient for one taco, let alone the three that are on the plate. I took 2 bites and sent it back. My wife had a chimichanga which was OK. And by OK, I mean it's on par with what you might buy in the freezer at Safeway.  On the plus side, the server was really nice. So, yeah.

This store is not very good. The only positive is that they have everything out for you to test and play with, and not locked behind glass. So, if you're in the market for a Sony product, you can go here and get the hands-on experience.  However, the staff is completely inept. They do try to be nice, but they know nothing about computers. My wife was in the market for a Vaio laptop and had some basic questions to start, a couple of which the manager was able to answer, and most of which I had to find out myself by inspecting the laptops. We targeted the F series because my wife likes to play video games and to be portable. Once the manager got wind that she plays video games, he just kept repeating that they were running Starcraft 2 on one of the F series in the store, as if that's all we needed to hear to fork over $1300.  We decided to head up to the Microsoft Store to do some comparison shopping. They are very nice up there. They had the previous iteration of the F series in stock for $1000, and the specs appeared to be the same except for having 4 GB RAM compared to 6 GB on the newer model down in the Sony store.  We went back to Sony to verify what made up the $300 difference on their model, and the manager could not explain the price difference. It appears the newer one had only been redesigned, and had the aforementioned higher RAM. That's not worth $300 though. The manager referred me to another associate he referred to as "the Vaio expert" and drifted away. I guess he'd had enough of us and probably doesn't work on commission. I asked "the Vaio guy" if the newer model had faster RAM or a faster RPM hard drive, and his eyes glazed over with ignorance. He said he would Google it for me, and I watched the painful process of someone Googling when they don't actually know what they're looking for. I finally thanked him for his time and asked some follow-up questions I thought he should know: Do they offer an educator discount? He doesn't know. He thinks maybe a student discount, but he doesn't know if and how much. Are any accessories included? He doesn't know. He doesn't think so. I fish for a free laptop case or free mouse or SOMETHING, practically coming right out and saying, "I'm giving you plenty of opportunities to sell me but you're not taking any of them, dipstick."  No dice. I went upstairs and bought it from the Microsoft Store. 10% educator discount, nice. You stink, Sony Style.

I dig this place. Yes, it is clearly Microsoft's attempt at something like the Apple Store. Unlike at the Apple Store however, the associates here actually seem to have time to help you. Forget Best Buy, seriously. I won't even go there, literally or rhetorically.  We hit Microsoft Store after being given the runaround down at the Sony Style store. The staff is very friendly and the woman we talked to easily answered all of our questions. We bought a Sony Vaio from her. She offered the free "Out of Box Experience" in which they take out your laptop and show you the basic functionality, install Windows updates, and so on. They charge like $100 for this type of thing at Best Buy. They also have three-year Microsoft support plans on offer, but they don't pressure you with it at all. We declined these things and were on our way.  They offer a 10% educator discount, which saved us $100 on our laptop. Score! Great experience.

Fry's and Fry's Marketplace is ostensibly the first "suburbanite" grocery store to appear in Casa Grande, part of a wave of development a few years back that also brought us Target (yay), Dillard's (uck), Best Buy, Harkins, and so on. The rest of the grocery stores in town are either Wal-Mart or some other chain that has a mini-Wal-Mart vibe going on.  The Fry's has a few good things going for it. The food selection is awesome, and many things are represented that Casa Grande has never seen the likes of, like fresh sushi and an olive bar. Of course, I never see anyone buying it, so who knows how long the dream will last. The greeters are also friendly.  There are also a few things dragging this joint down to two stars. First, I've been there twice within 10 minutes of the posting closing time and found all the doors locked. Really annoying, considering this is the only place to buy groceries on the north end of town. Otherwise, you're looking at a 10 minute trek into town.   Second, the front-end manager is completely clueless or absent or both. Literally every time I go there, there are too few checkout lanes open. If you have a ton of stuff, you will wait forever since only 1 or 2 of the lanes are regular non-express lanes. If you have a couple things, prepare to wait behind gobs of technically inept people trying to operate the self-checkout kiosks.   Third, the baggers (if you manage to get a bagger -- unlikely) have not been trained properly and they will smash your goods into a pulp if you don't watch them like a hawk. I have seen them try placing a bag full of soup cans on top of peaches. Of course, then you can't watch the cashier for ringing errors. I don't know which is worse. Do you want to have bashed fruit, or do you want to pay extra when they ring up your Hungarian wax peppers as gold bullion? You decide!  Overall, they have good stuff. The produce stays fresh for days on end, unlike the almost-overripe stuff sold at Safeway and Albertson's in town. However, having good stuff is overshadowed by crappy customer service and the fact that half your stuff is likely to be obliterated and/or overcharged.

Hoooolllllly cripes on a popsicle stick.  Ever eat a full-course meal and then want to start all over again because it was just that damned good?   This place is a home run in every sense. Not just a regular home run, but one of the ones where the ball shatters the stadium lights and Robert Redford is running the bases with sparks falling everywhere.   I honestly don't even remember every bit of what was consumed. It was a blur of pure delight. There were these delicious peppers in cream sauce and tomatoes with goat cheese for appetizers. Oh, man. I could've eaten those until the act was criminalized. At some point corn on the cob with parmesan appeared. Then entrees came. I had the halibut (yes, you can get insanely fresh seafood in Phoenix, it's a myth that you cannot). It was so perfect and firm and tasteful... others got the lamb and it was sinful. You have to literally find a wooden booth and go to confession after eating it. I'm available for light penance if you can't find willing clergy.  Anyway, the desserts. I'm not a dessert-ordering person, but we got puddings and cakes and I wanted them all in my mouth immediately now. We polished everything off and I seriously wanted the menu back so I could start again. The drinks!  The drinks were off the hook. We tried ordering mint juleps but the bartender had other things in mind. He had invented a variation on the mint julep and would we care to try it? Of course we would. Oh, it was game on. So tasty.  Also, the ambiance here is just killer. The kitchen is right there in the middle of everything... and it's the quietest, most efficient kitchen I've ever seen. Ever watch those reality shows where everyone is shouting in the kitchen? How long till the risotto is done and whatnot? I didn't hear a peep from those geniuses all night. They just toiled back there and pumped miracles all night. Also, most of the ingredients for everything made are local!  Get thee to FnB.

I can't speak to the various deluxe and mixed concoctions available here, but the basic drip coffee is excellent. Every time I've been here I order just a drip coffee, black. If you add cream and sugar you are going to sully the taste of whatever beans they use--they are literally among the best I've had. Even if you hate drinking black coffee, I recommend it at least once.  The atmosphere at Lola is very laid back and welcoming. There are always available tables when I go in, and everything is kept clean and tidy. I have been to other coffee shops downtown in which this is definitely not the case (difficult to find a table, messes left out, etc.)  If you are in the area looking for a good cup, check it out. It is right next store to Pita Jungle as well, so might be a good destination for after-meal joe.

I was bracing myself to be grumpy about eating at Hillside Spot after reading the other not-so-stellar reviews. It has a lot of potential, for sure--potential to be great, but also potential to make people grumpy.  The bottom line is that the food is really good, at least at breakfast. However, they definitely have a "system" that can be unfamiliar or even unnerving to people. You place your order with a counter person (the one we had was neither personable nor rude... she just kind of existed) and they hand you a number. You have to get your own drinks, your own tableware, and so on. They don't necessarily tell you this. I had to bumble around like an idiot looking for everything because it was my first time.  The food was great. It was nice and fresh, cooked to order, and prompt. I recommend the Egg Torta or the Croque Monsieur. The Apple Compote seemed a bit rich for one person. Great coffee and... ta-da... great tea. Lots of places get tea wrong.  Read the other reviews (like Amy S's)  before you go and make sure their "thing" is your thing. If you have doubts about this service model or prefer full service, you probably won't be satisfied.

Great place that staffs people who definitely go "above and beyond".  I've been in twice to buy car batteries, and both times they offered to look up my information to see if I had a warranty on file. They also showed an interest in helping me get the lowest price battery available, instead of trying to upsell me a premium battery I didn't want.  The last time I visited I stupidly forgot to bring the right tool to get my old battery out of the car, so I walked in and sheepishly asked if they have any socket sets for purchase. The guy poo-pooed that idea and offered to just loan me the correct tool. A very nice touch.

This is a really good place to get a tasty, fresh sub. They have much better bread, in my opinion, that other sandwich chains. The staff is on the ball and friendly, and the facility is clean. If I must get "fast food", I'd rather get it somewhere clean...  To really get the Jersey Mike's experience, ask for your sub "Mike's Way". They will ask even if you don't. They basically douse it in oil and vinegar and then put some seasoning on top.. I think it's oregano, salt, and pepper. It makes for a great sub, and it's not as messy as you might think.  The location, right next to Starbucks, is also a great place to chill for a while and enjoy some free wifi.

This place is utterly fantastic--I'm so glad I went.  The staff is very nice and extremely knowledgeable. The prices are quite competitive and the ambiance is relaxing. There are plenty of places to light up and kick back if you buy a cigar there.  By far the best part of the place is the private club. As mentioned by other reviewers, it is $300/year. But, you get your own locker where you can stash cigars and some of your favorite bottles. The club areas are very nicely appointed and clean--the perfect place to sit down and forget about your worries for a while. There is Direct TV, internet access, a small kitchen, and other perks.  I hesitate to call it the ultimate Man Cave, because they are clearly very welcoming to women.  But... it's the ultimate Man Cave.

This place is a great diversion from the ho-hum subs and customer experience at Subway and Blimpie's. If you absolutely love the Subway experience of getting sugar and sodium-laden "fake" bread choices and you require your food be measured in inches, go back to Subway and you'll be happy.  JM's is a fantastic customer experience, first of all. The people working there actually engage you and ask things other than what you want on your sandwich. You get the idea they are there because they buy into the business model, which is really cool. Last time I was there, the manager was working the register and giving active feedback to the other people. "Hey man! You skimped on the oregano!" Love it. Yes, if you get it "Mike's way", it is covered in oil and vinegar. It's an experience and a taste. If you require assembly-line, dry, tasteless subs, again go to Subway.  There are plenty of great hot and cold subs on the menu, and a lot of them are healthy. "Mike's way" is a decent way to having a filling lunch that doesn't overload you in calories and saturated fat.  Give it a try. Chances are you'll not find yourself back at Subway any time soon.

This is a really great barber and I'm glad I found them because some of the other barbers in the vicinity have fallen into disorganization or poor service.  I walked in off the street today and although they were pretty busy, Andre was available to cut my hair right away. He did a great job and had really impressive attention to detail. There were a lot of other people in the shop and they have several TVs, video games, and quite a few interesting conversations going on. This is a place where you don't have to just sit silently and get your hair cut--you can join in the conversations and generally have a relaxing time.  I would recommend this place for any type of haircut. They also have a new salon in the back where they do ladies, although I didn't venture back there.  By the way, the Yelp map displays this shop in the wrong location. It's right off Chandler Blvd. and 48th street in the plaza with Waffle House.

This is a beautiful, clean branch with well-operating ATMs outside. If all you need to do is pull up and deposit a check, you're golden.  What I can't figure out is what's going on inside. I've been inside this branch three times, all of them to get something notarized. I was greeted by a friendly person, and noticed the comfortable atmosphere and other workers lingering around smiling at me. The only problem is that twice I was told no notary was available, and the last time I was told it would be a 10 minute wait, and then a 15 minute wait. There are no customers inside this branch! I don't know what they're doing, and why they can't notarize something for me in a timely manner.  All three times I drove down the street to Chase, where a nice guy notarized my stuff for free and told me there are always at least 3 notaries in the building at all times. I can't be buggered to switch my account over to Chase, but I would if it wasn't such a hassle.

Kathy is extremely friendly a good at what she does.  I had her alter my daughter's prom dress. Everything went smoothly--Kathy was well aware of the timelines involved in the various area proms and made sure everything happened in a timely manner. She was very nice to me and my daughter, and made sure to explain appropriate things to each of us.  Make sure you call ahead if you decide to use her services! I think she works by fitting appointment only, and only on certain days of the week.

Great place, very competent staff, and fast service.  I needed new tires for my Triumph Street Triple so got a hold of Danny on several positive recommendations from other riders I trust. He suggested some tires for me based on my stated needs and told me to come down any time.  When I showed up, he was finishing with some other customers. I only had to wait a few minutes and Danny was working on my bike. It didn't take long at all. He finished the job, took the bike for a spin around the parking lot to test the installation, and then we settled up.  Very happy with the price, friendliness, and speed of service.

We were really happy with our first visit to Pomegranate.  We went in for Sunday breakfast, and were very piqued by the menu and everything else this place has to offer. It's almost too much to take in at first--as you glance around, you see lots of interesting stuff that could take a while to explore. The unique menu aside, they have many types of tea and a great selection of coffee. The best part of the menu is that everything is fresh, and most things are configurable with different options depending on whether you're vegan.  I got the breakfast burrito, which is available with egg or tofu. I got tofu and the vegan cheese. I had a little moment with the cashier when I ordered coffee with cream. See, I'm not a vegan but I was trying the whole vegan experience to see how everything tastes. As soon as I said I wanted cream in my coffee, I realized the paradox and my folly. He kindly offered me vegan options and I chose soy cream after putting his mind at ease and letting him know I was just a vegan poseur. My wife got the french toast.  Hey, at least I don't claim to be vegan and go around sneaking bacon whenever it suits me.  Everything came out within a reasonable amount of time and was absolutely a home run. The burrito was so damned good that I considered eating the three beans I had dropped on the table. It came with fruit and a fresh pico de gallo type thing whose ingredients remain a mystery, but it was delicious.  Some criticisms I've read in here are understandable, and in the end this place isn't for everyone. If it gets busy, I could see the food taking a while, but this is a place where everything is made from fresh ingredients. It would take me an hour at home to make the burrito I had this morning.   All in all, I don't give out 5-star ratings often, but this place is deserving. If you want a fresh, delicious meal, whether you are vegan or not, and like a friendly, casual, non-pretentious atmosphere, check it out.

Everything we've had here has been delicious! It's a certain type of food--if you don't like strong flavors and sauces, maybe it won't be for you, but we think it's fantastic.   The appetizers are good--try the homemade chips with onion dip, or the onion straws. Both are fantastic but start filling you up fast. The sandwiches are awesome--I've tried the reuben and the pastrami. Whatever sauerkraut they use is delicious and not too strong. My wife has also tried the french toast, and it was decadent. Definitely at least two meals' worth. They also have a lot of gluten-free items, including desserts, in case you are with someone with an intolerance or allergy.  The service is mostly good, but a bit slow for my tastes. The last time we visited, our server would disappear for long periods of time, which can be inconvenient for some.

Really nice place to set up and rehearse if your band doesn't want to infiltrate someone's den or living room. I can't speak to the recording services they offer.  The equipment in the room we used was very nice. Studio K has new Krank amplification for guitar and bass, plus a full set of drums and PA. They have lots of other misc equipment that you might not be expecting, such as guitar, keyboard, and mic stands. We were short a mic and were able to check out one from the guy at the desk with just a photo ID.  The climate is nice inside and our practice experience was very good.

Went here for a late lunch on a weekday and it was fantastic!  The place was deader than disco when we walked in, but the staff was very courteous and the facility sparkling clean. We ordered an eggplant starter, which came out with hot, delicious flatbread. It was ungodly good--I don't know what I've been doing with eggplant, but it isn't this. We also ordered gyro sandwiches. Wow... the gyro meat was perfectly cooked, and they give you a LOT of it. The bread was absolutely stuffed with meat, lettuce, tomato, and onion. The yogurt sauce is fantastic and they give you plenty of it. Another reviewer mentioned that they are charging extra for the sauce, but that is only for "extra" sauce.   Give this place a try--I'm sure you will enjoy it.

Not all that impressive, as it approaches dive-bar status without having any of the charm and personality of a dive bar. About the best that can be said of it is that if you just want to get sloshed at happy hour with your friends while watching sports, it's probably cheap and easy to do so.  The beer selection is pretty poor, and it should be a crime to have Guinness on tap without the bartender knowing how to draw a proper pint. They come out with either 1/2 of head or 7 inches of head. Blech.  The biggest issue I noted is that everything is pretty dirty. They brought us to a table that hadn't been wiped down, and then pulled the trick where they ask you to sit down and then proceed to wipe all the debris off the table, half of which falls in your lap. The seats and other things in the bar are in dire need of a deep cleaning.  Despite cheap beer and decent service, you just don't want to sit and drink very long in a dirty establishment.

My wife and I had an excellent experience at 27 Tattoo Studio.  First, their communication is fantastic. I originally submitted a question by email and they were quick and thorough in their response. They answered all of my questions and helped me set up appointments that fit our schedule.  Second, the studio itself is gorgeous, clean, and really quite interesting to visit. The layout and ambiance are unique, and everyone we ran into there was cool.  Third, the quality of the work is really top-notch. We were actually tattooed by a guest artist, Ryan from Chicago. We are so happy with the work he did that we've already started trying to figure out when he might be coming back to Phoenix. The resident artists at 27 Tattoo Studio are excellent as well and I wouldn't hesitate to be tattooed by any of them.  Getting tattoos can be a scary experience. Whether you are getting your first tattoo, or are trying to find a free space on your body for your 30th tattoo, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this shop.

I agree with Jan S. that this place has potential.  The decor is nice. Not my style, but every restaurant can't be a recreation of Rex Harrison's study in My Fair Lady. I often wonder why restaurants choose to install a sit-down bar when they don't offer any intriguing drinks or a bar experience, per se. If the best liquor you offer can also be purchased at Safeway, just keep it in the back and skip the "bar".  The service was pretty good. The server was friendly and seemed knowledgeable about the menu. I witnessed a couple gaffes that can probably be attributed to growing pains.  The food... meh. It was average if cheap, but below average for this price point. Most of the plates are around $10-12 for lunch. Our table ordered a paupia yuan (a fresh roll with vegetable and prawns) for an appetizer. It was not very tasteful and the roll completely disintegrated upon biting. Some rolls are meant to be eaten in one bite, but this was cut much too large for that. I ordered the goong ma muang (wok-fried tiger prawns and mango in chili basil sauce). The presentation was not very appealing: a large ball of rice in the corner, and then a big mess of prawns, mango, and lots of onions spread around the plate and drowned in sauce. I dislike onions and was a bit cranky that about half the total mass of this dish was onions, despite not being mentioned on the menu. The flavor combination of the prawns and mango was decent... I just wish more of the dish was that, and not onions. Lots of work needed on preparation and presentation.  Overall, this is typical Scottsdale chic... lots of sound and fury, signifying not much more than other, cheaper Thai places.

Man, this stuff is good.  Yes they are a bit pricey, but you are getting really good quality and really good burgers. You'd pay more for a crappy burger at Applebee's, for sure. Five Guys doesn't really compare to fast food if you know your beef.  As an aside, the soda machines are a fascinating study in generational usability. Just sit over there and observe for five minutes.

This is an extremely good company. They are very clear about costs and factors that determine how much they will charge to clean your home. They are very easy to deal with in terms of scheduling.  The crews they send out are punctual and very personable. They take time to walk through the house both before and after the cleaning, to make sure you are satisfied. They are very thorough and include a lot of nice touches you wouldn't normally expect from a housecleaning company.  They might not be the cheapest around, but you will definitely feel like you got an excellent value for your money. Housecleaning is not something to skimp on.

There are few places where you can dump this much stuff in one vessel and not be in danger of messing up the taste. Basically it's just this place and the Chinese buffet.  I put a collection of things in my cup that, by all rights, should have been questionable... but it was soooo good. I was like a kid in a candy store. This is the kind of thing I would have begged my parents to take me to for years. And they would never take me.  Now I'm an adult and I can go all I want... muahahahahaha!  Really, really friendly staff. Really, really clean joint.

Super addition to the Ahwatukee scene!  I've been here a few times now, and every dish I've tried has been very good. I've tried their sandwiches, their pizza, and their pasta dishes. Oh, and the spinach and artichoke dip is divine--you must try it. They have good drink specials and all kinds of stuff going on every day of the week.  The service is very friendly--every server I've had has been great. One of the times they had a new person running food to the tables. After he was at our table, the manager came by literally 30 seconds later to ensure that he was polite and mentioned the things they wanted him to mention. I was floored.  This place can get quite loud at times over the weekend, especially if you are seated in the side of the restaurant where the bar is. It might have just been the night I was there, as there were three different donkey beasts braying 100 decibel laughter at regular intervals one Sunday I was there. If you are looking for a quieter dinner, ask to be seated on the other side.  I feel a bit bad for Bell'Italia across the road... they've already cut their hours, and I don't think Spinato's is going to make it any easier for the other Italian places in Ahwatukee...

Still very good, but...  This location has become extremely popular and they seem more or less ill-equipped to deal with it. The food is still excellent, and the servers are very nice.  However, there were issues the last three times we visited. Once was a Saturday afternoon and the entire contents of the soccer fields south of Pecos were eating lunch at Spinato's. They were extremely busy (good) but had run out of things (bad).   The next time we went, there were so many people jammed in the front entrance that we couldn't even get through to the hostess station. Again, glad you're busy--but you need to set up someone outside or do something so customers can at least get their name in or find out how long the wait is. We found out later that there was a beauty pageant in town and everyone was bombarding the local restaurants. That should be no surprise though if you operate a restaurant near hotels. Stay on top of what's in town and keep ahead of it.  The third time, they were moderately busy but had again run out of multiple menu items, one of which is our favorite. It was communicated at the time of ordering, but it should have been communicated at the time of getting the menus so we had time to plan on something else. It's also good form to offer an alternative to the customer, not just say, "We're out of A, B, and C. Sorry."  I'll probably go back from time to time, but will avoid any possibly busy time and will probably asking the hostess if they are out of things before I'm even seated.

I was literally scared of going in here for a few months after it opened, because I know nothing about cheese and wine. The place is so small that I thought as soon as I walked in, I'd be sniffed out as an amateur and tables full of socialites would begin laughing at me as they stared through their monocles.   Not at all! It is very friendly and unassuming. The staff is laid back and helpful, and they appear to have many great little plates on offer. My wife and I stopped in just for a glass of wine, and it was very nice.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their meat and cheese offerings--it looks like a great place to have a relaxed and quiet lunch.

New coffee place on Chandler Blvd and Desert Foothills Pkwy in Ahwatukee! I'm excited since there are not any good coffee offerings in the area unless you drive much further east. They are in the suite formerly occupied by Babaloo's Cuban Cafe.  Yes I know there is a Starbucks in the Safewa... yawn... I got tired just writing that sentence.  I stopped in this morning to get a cup and check out the remodeling job. The place looks nice--good selection of places to sit, inside and out. There is at least one larger table where a group could sit. The vibe is cozy but nothing special--looks like any other coffee house. The two employees were very friendly and chatted with me about the menu offerings and so on.  I ordered a regular drip coffee to check out the quality of their bean. It is very good--much better taste and quality than anything else available at this particular intersection. They also sell it in bags if you want to take some home. The prices are very good as well. I don't really go for the fancy drinks but if you do, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  This place has potential. Check it out and see if this could be your new coffee hangout. They are open until 7pm on most nights, so hopefully they will start doing some things like offering live music. They have free wi-fi as well.

Since this shop has been up and running for a couple of months now and had time to iron out the kinks, here's an updated review.  As others have noted, the staff is really friendly. Any minor logistical glitches seem to be a thing of the past. The drinks are good. I've tried most of their coffee drinks, plus the chai. They are professionally prepared, customizable, and very good! The food... eh, no so much.   I've been underwhelmed by the food quality and selection the few times I tried it. The scones are pretty dry. I ordered a breakfast burrito this morning and it was so comically small that I literally broke out in fits of laughter when I got home and took it out of the bag. Check out the photo I uploaded. Maybe call it a "breakfast bite" or something.  The shop had been hosting open mic events and other coffee-shop type stuff, although it's not well publicized and you pretty much have to go to the store and look for flyers. Recommend to the owners you get a web site and start engaging customers with email and social media.  I'm still a fan, and will continue to go here from time to time, but I won't likely order food again.

CLOSED  About two months ago I went to get some coffee and this place was closed, with signs posted from the landlord that the locks were changed due to rent delinquency. I was hopeful the owners would find a way forward and re-open, but it doesn't look like that will be occurring. Too bad! Back to gas station coffee, I guess...

Good place to stop on your way out of town if you need gas or a drink. Easy exit on Carefree Highway and easy to get back on the 17. It is a common meeting place for motorcyclists, so please watch where you're going and be mindful of them.  This is one of many gas stations that have for some reason gotten into the business of keeping kegs and filling growlers. Be forewarned that the way they fill growlers (straight from a tap and not using a hose) will cause your growler to go flat within 24 hours. Fine if you plan to drink it same-day, but don't fill a growler here expecting to put it in your fridge for a week.

Overall very happy with this location.  I will say straight away that they do have some growing pains--the location has been VERY popular right from the start and it takes a lot of work to grease all the cogs and get a very busy restaurant working properly.  The food has been very good--the service slightly lacking. It seems that they should have put more focus on hiring experienced food service workers rather "cool" or "cute" people.  I do encourage anyone to try it out--just have a little patience because while the big picture is good, there are "little things" that you need to look past to have a good time. Just give them feedback if something is missed, and they will make it right.

This is a great place to enjoy some beer and listen to live music. I went on a Saturday night and had no problem getting a great seat and great service. The bartenders are very friendly and will keep your drinks flowing.  The acoustics are also very good for listening to live music. The bands set up in one corner, and since the place is all on one level with no obstructions other than the bar in the middle, the sound travels well into the back corners. Some bars have lots of weird angles and walls that make it difficult to listen to live music unless you are sitting right up front.  I cannot speak to the food menu or to the waitstaff, because I'm the type of guy that just sits at the bar and orders beer. Because I love America.

Pros:  - They have groceries. - You don't have to drive all the way to 40th and Chandler. - You probably won't get killed by zombies while shopping here.  Cons:  - Very limited selection; this is some kind of "grocery store lite". The meat dept doesn't even have ground pork. - The produce dept is the absolute pits. Lots of what they put out is bruised and damaged. If it does look OK, trust me when I say that it's one day away from going bad. I've bought so much produce here only to behold a pile of mush the next day. - Lots of snotty Foothills biddies who would just as soon step on your face as say "excuse me". - The cashiers must be going for some kind of slowness world record. One guy in particular is so slow that I've literally contemplated calling him out on it. He's got to be doing it on purpose. - The baggers are inattentive something awful--they'll throw canned goods on top of fruit, chicken in with dish detergent, etc. One time they literally put a six-pack of beer on top of a loaf of bread. - The manager doesn't exist. Good luck contacting whomever it is, if you have a complaint.

Things have improved a little bit at this Safeway since last year:  - There is a bit more selection. - They are fairly responsive to concerns and there seems to be at least one manager roaming around at all times to ask if you need any help.  Some things are still very bad:  - The produce situation hasn't improved. There is still bruised, over-ripe produce everywhere that goes bad within a day of purchase, or is already bad. - The baggers are still recklessly inattentive and will bag dish soap with bread, milk on top of produce, and so on. They literally don't even look down... they just toss items into bags randomly until each bag is full.

I was very glad to be introduced to this place by some relatives that live nearby and are more plugged into the downtown scene. I was initially skeptical about the concept--I figured either the beer or the food was going to be middling. It's difficult to do both well. However, Angels Trumpet does not disappoint on either front.  The food is quite good. I went with a group of eight and got to try several things. Everything was quite good, although I'm very stubbornly against home-made or craft ketchup, which they give you here with the fries.   The beers are very good. You have to put a bit of thought into what you order, and either know what you like or be open-minded. Obviously an Imperial Russian Stout isn't for everybody. If you're going to order it, make sure you know something about it and know what to expect. Same goes for everything else they have.  Overall, a great place to enjoy some inventive menu choices and sample some beers you don't find easily or often.

This is an excellent little shop for shipping, printing, notary services, document shredding, and so on. It is a small independent business, and the staff is very polite and helpful. You can ship FedEx, UPS, USPS, etc. They will help with packaging, and will direct you to the best and most economical way to ship your things. At least twice I've walked in thinking I wanted to ship something UPS, but they pointed out to me that a different method would be cheaper.  Please note that there IS a surcharge for shipping here. This is how they make money, so don't be surprised. Just ask what the surcharge is for various things so you're not surprised. If you ask them to box something up for you, or repackage something, or add extra services, there are going to be charges. They are straightforward about them--just ask.  It might cost you $7 to ship something Priority Mail down the street at the post office, but you'll have to wait in line for an hour and deal with surly USPS employees. At Mailboxes & More, it might cost you $8 or $9, but you're paying for convenience.

This is a boutique in the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall that sells the NightRider jewelry collection manufactured locally by Ganem Jewelry. The jewelry is very high quality and mostly sterling silver, heavy, and in a hard rock biker style. It is design and hand made locally, and priced accordingly. Check out their web site for their full line and prices so you don't get too much sticker shock when you go in. However, I think everything is priced fairly for what you get.  The staff is extremely nice and helpful, and they definitely take the time to make sure you get the right piece in the right size that suits your style. They have rings, chains, necklaces, pendants, buckles, wallet chains, and many other things.

Best place around to watch a mainstream movie.  The prices are reasonable considering the costs movie theaters pay now to lease the prints. Harkins still has a reasonable matinee price and even a movie that starts at 5:00 qualifies as a matinee. The concessions prices are, of course, outrageous. In case you don't know anything about the theater business, this is how they make virtually all of their money. They don't make anything from ticket sales.  The theaters are pretty comfortable, and we have always preferred them to AMC because of the reclining chairs. They do a pretty good job cleaning the theaters between shows as well--there is very rarely any visible mess in the theater from the last show.  My only complaint is that they really need to get on some schedule of steam cleaning the seats. Maybe they do this already, but they need to do it more often. The seats get pretty funky with spills, stains, etc. after a while.
