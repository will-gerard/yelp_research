I love Big Jim! I mean, I love the sandwich Big Jim here at Welcome Diner. Gravy, Fried Chicken, biscuit, glorious.  Nearly all of the food here will clog your arteries, but it tastes so damn good who really cares about that.  I don't know what the hell a Jackfruit is but it tastes as good as any bbq meat sandwich I've had. The drinks are made to order too and are quite tasty.  Only real complaint is I think it's a tad overpriced for the amount of food you get with certain sandwiches.  Sometimes the line can be ridiculously long especially on first friday so just, ya know, prepare to wait for that Big Jim.

I dunno the food was fine, OK, average, whatever you want to call it. The baja sauce got old pretty fast as it was just too rich and I only had it on one enchilada.  The food wasn't inedible (think borderline 2/3 star) just completely pedestrian.  The prices are pretty affordable I suppose.  Service felt rushed when the servers did show up and super super slow otherwise (took us over 2 hours for dinner) which ultimately dropped it down to 2 from 3 stars for me.    The bar did seem pretty happening though so maybe i'll comeback just for drinks or happy hour earlier in the day.  Wish I coulda tried this place in the 1950s, 60s or 70s just to compare.

Nice cozy neighborhood brewery.  Friendly staff, bearded brewer with smiling face on website, what more do you need?  Ok, honestly the beer is nothing special.  Amber, ipa, pale ale, cream ale, yadda yadda, heard it all before.  But in this instance I don't mind.  I'm not looking for some ginger infused sour beer at Sunup.    I'm looking for solid drinkable beer at great prices with a friendly staff and a simple but satisfying menu.  And hey, every now and then they'll throw something interesting on cask.  Come and get it.

This is currently my go to pizza joint for Friday/Saturday night take out when I'm looking for that typical traditional crust style pizza (or in other words, when I'm in the mood to load up on a crapload of carbs).    As others have pointed out they also have vegan options and Italian style entrees.  Anyway, talking standard pizza here, the ingredients are quality, service is good (20 minute turn around whenever I take out), price is reasonable, and it tastes delicious.  There's really not much else for me to say.   Simply solid (aka really good!) pizza (and breadsticks).  Definitely much better than your standard big chain pizza places.

I'm not sure if it's the generic sounding name or if it's just the nature of your typical american grill type restaurants not sounding exciting to me anymore, but I seem to always forget how good this place actually is.  The Restaurant itself is located in a strip mall but the inside is very well decorated and service is always friendly.  I don't really have that much to say here - it's your typical American Grill with some Southwest flair but unlike most of those places it is actually very good! And it's local to boot!

It's a Trader Joe's so you probably already know what that entails.  if not, the selection can seem a little limited at first. Almost everything I've tried I end up liking.  The  Dark chocolate turbinado sugar almonds are amazing...   Sure, they repackage other brands as their own and half of the allure is probably good marketing/branding but whatever.  Be warned this location can get quite crowded on Sundays as it seems a little smaller than other stores I've been to. It can actually be a bit of a nightmare at times, including trying to find parking.

Still love it, but this location is really turning into a madhouse on weekends. I need to start waking up earlier to get over there or something...  At least we don't have lines out the door yet just to get in the store like in NYC...

You can really taste the difference between homemade fresh pasta and the alternatives here.  They had to have what seemed like at least 20 different pasta varieties at this place all with a plethora of meats, veggies, spices, and different sauces. The dim lighting, white tablecloths and red brick made for perfect decor for a romantic evening.  Back to the food - it was amazing. Lots of umami going on. OK, I don't know I just wanted to throw umami into a review at least once. What the hell is umami again? Anyway, the pasta just kind of melted in your mouth with all of the sauces/butter/whatever else cooking magic they performed in the kitchen.  Tiramisu was also delicious and a good size.  Know this place can be pretty pricey - they bring out a tray of pastas that aren't on the menu that of course sound delicious in the hopes that you will order one of those instead of the menu pastas that are 10-20 dollars cheaper.  With a bottle of wine/dessert/appetizer your  looking at $$$$ here.  I did get black truffle on my pasta though so I suppose you do get what you pay for. Mmmmm black truffle - that's umami right?

Milkshake was killer.  The food was okay, it was what you would expect - nothing special, terrible for you, fills you up but doesn't have a ton of flavor or character.  I just kind of think of this place as a slightly souped up and overpriced steak-n-shake.  It's okay for what it is...a 2 star joint.  Just be aware going in and it's perfectly fine.

I think Four Peaks has that nostalgia factor for me.  They don't have the best beer in the valley but there's something about their large wide-open space with the brewing tanks in the back that just 'feels' right.  The dim lighting at night adds to the vibe.  The food is pretty good for a brewery if your looking for standard american fare (ie. burgers, fries, wings).  Prices are reasonable on both beer and food and portions are filling.  If you're a beer snob (like me) there's definitely better breweries and beer bars in the valley.  But if you just want to kick back with friends or family, eat some solid food, and enjoy some drinkable albeit average beer - this place won't let you down.

The pizza is pretty tasty.  Solid thin crust italian style pie.  If i'm nitpicking they are pretty stingy on the toppings and I wish they were a dollar or two cheaper.  Biggest complaint here is the building itself.  If you get stuck inside one of those tiny little rooms that were built originally as someone's bedroom with like 7 tables be prepared to hear everyone's conversation but your own.  Ask for the crushed red pepper infused olive oil - it is glorious. Dump the crushed red pepper on that spicy sausage.  Heat lovers dream.

*Update* Replaced with Sid's Cafe  Just another place on my trip to Vegas where I realized that many of the restaurants here are distinctly mediocre to below average especially when you account for what you are paying.  I guess I'm just cheap and should have gone to nicer places although I stopped here out of convenience only.  Service was actually decent during a busy lunch rush but like the two star rating describes on Yelp the food was simply "meh".

I have been to El Portal multiple times and I really am not sure why.  I think it has to do with the fact that there aren't a ton of options within a 2 minute walk of work.  I try to go at slightly off hours to avoid the lunchtime rush and at least haven't had any issues with service, although a good number of the tables usually seem pretty filthy and haven't been wiped off.    The food is pretty bland and uninteresting.  I usually get a couple enchiladas, and the sauce, beans, rice, everything, just kind of melds together into a one-note bland mess.  I guess I shouldn't be expecting much though when the food is so cheap.  I guess that's a positive.  One time the rice was under cooked and crunchy...I still ate it.  Unless you are starving, want Mexican food (if you can call it that) and are within a 2 minute walk I don't really see a reason to go here.  Unfortunately, I seem to meet those 3 criteria every now and then.

My goodness this place was outstanding! I asked for the hottest spice level (5) and they actually delivered to the point where I didn't need to add any additional sauces from their free selections on the table.  This in of it self is an automatic 4 stars minimum since I've been disappointed numerous times at other thai, indian, mexican, etc. restaurants.  Past the outstanding heat level the curry itself  still had a great flavor and creaminess and was served with a nice side of rice in a separate container.  Can't believe it took me this long to finally try this place. I was missing out.

Outdoor seating is a big selling point here.  Sit out on central and watch the cars, light rail, and people go by.  Cocktails are solid and Caribbean themed with Happy Hour all day Wednesday is pretty good.  Mimosas are pretty cheap on weekend mornings.  Food is quite yummy, the Ahi Tuna Tacos are particularly delicious.  I do like the fact you can get things here that you obviously wouldn't find at other restaurants such as plantains, johnny cakes, etc.  Portions are quite filling.  Bring your friends, relax, laugh, and pretend the closest large body of water isn't actually miles from here.

Well after making sure to avoid the restaurant nearby sponsored by one Guy Le Douche (I mean Fieri) we made our way to Hash House A Go Go.  The portions at this place are massive and they love to stick giant branches of rosemary into your food - that's cool I guess.  Anyway, this place is good ol comfort food done right.  Meatloaf was delicious, mashed potatoes nice and whipped. It hit the spot...  For once I found a place that didn't seem overpriced and under flavored like most of the more affordable options on or near the strip.  My only regret is that entire half of a meatloaf sandwich went to waste since the refrigerator in my hotel room was too damn small to fit all our food in - ugh.

Yes, it lives up to the hype....Animal Style no onions is where it's at people. They need to open up one of these closer to central phoenix.  It's either this location or the one on Rural in Tempe.  High Schoolers working here are usually friendly (maybe since they actually make a decent wage).  I want to see someone order a flying dutchman animal style for the lulz and messiness.  Traffic around this location feels a little worse though than the Chandler & Tempe locations.

I don't claim to be any kind of Pho expert but I do know that I like my Pho spicy so I appreciate the three sauces they bring out along with sliced peppers so you can tailor your soup to your own tastes.  The big bowls are pretty massive while the smaller bowls I'd say are still very decent sized too.  The Pho itself is a nice ratio of lots of broth with just enough noodles/meats/etc. - the perfect pick me up on a rainy day here in Phoenix.  This restaurant itself is in an old converted house (like many of the other restaurants in this area) so it's not the biggest place but the wait's usually not too bad if there is one. Parking lot is tiny - you've been warned.

If you love pickles, olives, and hot peppers like I do then you need to check out their Bloody Mary bar during Sunday brunch.  It...is...glorious...!  I Love the gourmet (but not pretentious) take on comfort food. Corn dog bites? Yes please.  They are definitely going for a bit of a hip vibe and I think they actually pull it off well.  I usually always sit outside though so there's that.  Happy Hour prices until 5pm everyday are quite reasonable and all of their signature cocktails I have tried have been delicious.  I've never had bad service here (although there has been some variance between great and just average).

I never knew Vegan sweets could taste so good. The tSoynamis are amazing particularly the classic peanut butter and chocolate flavor combination.  These tSoynamis are similar to a blizzard in the sense that it is a soft serve type ice cream with mix ins...that's when comparisons end though.  The ice cream here is vegan although the texture isn't quite as soft as traditional soft serve it's still pretty smooth on the whole.  The baked goods are also quite delicious and quite massive.  The prices are a little on the high side though and would add up quickly if one came here all the time for a coffee or dessert. Still need to try the brunch.

One of my favorite casual restaurants in Phoenix...it's that good.  Obviously this is a vegetarian/vegan restaurant but I hardly give that much thought these days.  It isn't really the defining characteristic to me - it's simply the fact that the food is just so damn tasty.  Shoot, if I'm craving meat I wouldn't have any issues coming here and getting one of their outstanding mock meat burgers or sandwiches.  If mock meats aren't your thing then try one of their veggie bowls - outstanding!  The prices are also quite reasonable - not necessarily typical fast dining cheap (ie. chipotle/panera) but not as much as most sit-down places that I think are a more apt comparison anyway. I rarely find this level of quality at this price point very often.  Beer selection is great too!  They've had several sour beers over the past few months which is amazing since most places don't have that level of variety in their beer selection.

Not quite as amazing as it used to be - or maybe I've been here too many times and the luster has worn off.  No longer get sides with the sandwiches either and prices have gone up.  I do want to try their new in-n-out substitute animal fries though for sure.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this place, its just no longer close to 5star territory for me anymore.

I've been wanting to try this place for months ever since I heard the food is actually spicy here (unlike most mexican/new mexican places I've tried).  The complementary salsas and chips they set down almost immediately confirmed this.  Seriously, the two salsas (green & red) were probably two of the most flavorful and hottest (the red at least) salsas I've ever had at a restaurant.  The Main course (red chili) also had a really good spice level that you don't always find at  american mexican or new mexican restaurants although it wasn't quite as hot as I was anticipating after hearing about this place and seeing the warning on the menu.  If you don't handle spicy food well you might feel differently. The beef itself also had a lot of flavor and was quite tender.  They have pretty decent happy hour too.  As Arnold Schwarzenegger once said "I'll be back!".

One of my go to place these days if I'm looking to chug (I mean drink) some good beer. The selection here is one of the best I have found so far in the Valley and includes 20+ taps of a multitude of beer styles.  The offerings range from common year round beers and seasonals, to imports and some of the slightly harder to procure stuff (If only I had actually enjoyed that Bourbon County Brand Stout - woops).  Service is usually pretty quick even when crowded (as it can be on the weekends) and the food menu is delicious, sober or otherwise.  Definitely a fan of the wings, and spam sliders.  Need to try the tv dinners in the future.   They have a nice outdoor patio and seating area as well where you can enjoy a game of bags/cornhole.  Who doesn't like cornhole?  Honestly, if you are into craft beer or just beer-curious you need to try this place out asap.

I'm still not completely sold on the concept as a regular thing but these "Zooks" are pretty dang tasty.  They make the sandwiches to order (expect a couple minutes wait) using a few simple but fresh ingredient combinations (ie. mozzarella, tomato, greens or egg, bacon, cheese, beans).  The owner is very friendly (and the other staff for that matter) and the place is always clean (why can't all other fast casual places do this?).  I do wish the sandwiches were just a little bit bigger though.  If you're looking for a unique 'sandwich' option give it a shot for breakfast or lunch.

*Update* Replaced with Edge Steakhouse  Happened to be in the LVH around lunch time and decided to give this place a try.  The menu looked good and they had a lot of different burger options (lamb, tuna, veggie, etc.).  Our server was pretty mediocre and didn't come across as if he cared about anything.  He wasn't necessarily rude but he did a bunch of smaller things like pour water sloppily spilling it over the table, didn't utter a word, only stopped by once or twice - just a very disinterested attitude.  None of this would be a big deal if the food was good but unfortunately it was not.  The mac & cheese tasted like it was from a box.  The fries had absolutely 0 seasoning.  The burger I had  was OK - think 3 stars.  You can get an average to slightly above average burger here if you add some of the unique toppings but the whole experience with waiter, garbage side dishes and of course the Vegas pricepoint drop this place down to 2 stars from 3 for me.

I think I'm starting to take this place for granted - shoot I almost decided to give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't get quite as excited as I used to about this place since I have been here too many times and it is no longer "a treat"....what was I thinking.  Anywho, the pizza here is amazing Neapolitan style pizza.  I think they've even been certified by some Italian Neapolitan association (along with only a couple other places in the Valley) that relates to the methods of cooking the pizza - so that's pretty cool I guess?  Does it make the pizza taste any better than the Italian style Pizza down the street? Who knows, but it clearly isn't hurting!    If I had ever been to Italy this would also be the section of the review where I ramble on about how it reminds me of that little Pizza joint just outside of Naples I went to and yadda yadda.  Check it out for yourself - I don't care if you are a deep dish person it is worth it.

Not the most inviting space I've ever been to but the food hits the spot and made up for it.  This is a no frills attached diner type place for sure.  The food isn't going to be as fancy pants as you might find at some of the breakfast joints in the valley but that doesn't mean it isn't delicious!   Joe (I think?) was making the rounds and gave me some additional hot sauce that wasn't on the table (cholula/tabasco). I thought it was too vinegary personally but I appreciated the gesture and being referred to as "hot sauce guy" was amusing.  Of course, I finally came here the week before I'm moving farther/further(seriously which is it?) away.....I suppose I can suck it up and make the 7 minute drive.

Stopped by Pizza People Pub on a Friday night for some food and beer.  The place was packed and loud with a dj spinning tunes right near the entrance.  The wait was a little on the long side (they said 30 minutes but I think it was longer) and I did notice a number of people walk away once they found out how long the wait was.  There are a number of couches and chairs to lounge around in near the entrance and outside so with a couple beers in our hands the wait became a non-issue.  The wings were probably some of the best I've had with a lot of substance and a nice buffalo sauce with some added pepper kick.  The pizza was also quite delicious although not necessarily my favorite.  Prices were alright although the pizza's were a little on the small side I thought.  Staff was very friendly throughout the night.  Ultimately, pizza people is a great place to gather, drink, and eat good food.  If I am truly craving pizza I might prefer a more traditional american/italian style place but pizza people's atmosphere and other menu alternatives definitely serves another niche on my food craving spectrum.

I really like Joyride.  I like the enchiladas with half green half red sauce, I like the hip colorful casual vibe, and I most definitely like the margaritas - oh the margaritas.  I just don't know if I actually like the tacos...I've never tried them.  Therein lies my only complaint with Joyride (and gourmet taco places in general).  The tacos just never seem like they are worth the price (unless you are here on a Taco Tuesday night or I suppose have self control and don't need 5-6 tacos like me...)  The free chips and salsa are a nice touch and the service is usually outstanding.  Like I said, the food is delicious! I promise I'll try the tacos eventually...

I'm all about their red chile burrito.  Green chile and carne asada were pretty damn good too but there's something about the red chile mixed with the gooey cheese, rice, beans, meat, sour cream that hits the spot.  It essentially feels like mexican (or whatever...mexican-american..) comfort food.  Prices are good (comparable to chipotle/qdoba's of the world) but the flavors are not the same at all (burrito house is better...).  They do a good job mixing the burritos here too. No one bite of only plain white rice, one bite just beans, etc. Only complaint is it needs to be even spicier!

I like my food,especially southeast Asian food to be hot and thank goodness this is one of the few places I've been to where the dishes that say they are spicy actually have a good burn to them.  It's nothing outlandish but you do start to sweat and feel the spices in dishes like the hot and sour soup.  I can't keep track of the number of thai, vietnamese, mexican, indian, chinese, you name it restaurants where I order a "spicy" dish and I'm left disappointed in the heat level.  They put a unique twist on a lot of dishes which I appreciate.  The hot and sour soup was like no other hot and sour soup I've had and they sometimes even warn you when you order the Pad Thai that it isn't going to be exactly like the dozen's of pad thai you can find in any restaurant here in Phoenix.   The Anime behind the bar can definitely lead to some amusing conversations...

I prefer this location to the one in Tempe personally. Yes, it's smaller, the selection isn't as large, and the focus is more on new books (which I like personally) but I just enjoy the modern darker vibe to the lighter, fluffier, grandma's living room vibe in Tempe (OK it's not that bad).    Despite the smaller selection you can find a variety of classics, and genres that you would expect at your typical local bookstore. I don't think they have many out of print or more obscure books here though if you care about that.  Grab a beer from the bar and start browsing.

I enjoy conveyor-belt sushi.  It's fun, convenient, and usually tastes good enough. The same holds true here at the Sushi Station.  The sushi was OK - same type of stuff you see at any conveyor belt place.    Really, I come to these places for the experience and the value more than anything.  Unfortunately,  I did think the prices were a tad higher than some comparable conveyor-belt experiences and the rolls a tad dinkier.  The service was pretty bad too.  They sat us at the bar and then somehow forgot about us until we had to ask for a server.  Not a big deal since you can grab many things from the conveyor belt but just kind of killed the experience a bit.  I'll probably be back to give this place another chance since it is so conveniently located and the sushi was the typical 3 star that I expect at this type of joint.   For now though this place doesn't rise above a "Meh" for me.

I just the love the atmosphere here - it is a bookstore after all.  There's something about being able to read a book or browse the selection while sipping on a beer that just feels 'right'.  Speaking of beer, they always have a small but solid selection as well as wine, and things to munch on.  The beer does rotate somewhat regularly as well and they do tap-takeovers as well.  Also have a small but solid selection of wine. The bread always looks so delicious I'll have to try that next time.

I couldn't quite figure out what this lot used to be in a past life but it's a cool place with a unique set of buildings.  The buildings here sort of form a neat little courtyard walkway area that you can walk through or host events at while walking towards the main dining room/bar area.  The roasted cauliflower was the best thing of the night hands down - never thought I'd say that at a restaurant but it was damn good.  The Beef Ribs were massive!  Honestly, it was almost too much Meat and too rich, again never thought I'd say that but still worth it to keep my gluttony game fresh. I wish they'd let you substitute out the french fries though on the dishes because that was a little much with the Beef Ribs, it needed some sort of lighter veggie or salad or something.  This place would definitely make a good date night with the unique hip vibe, couple glasses of wine, and a few small plates.
