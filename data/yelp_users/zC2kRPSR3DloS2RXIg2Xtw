If you are looking for unique gift ideas or looking for that one band shirt you had a few years back but somehow got misplaced, this place will have it. From shirts to posters and from patches to new creepers, Shirts and Things has it all!!  I go here when I, in search of a new shirt, a purse for my lady, some patches, whatever it maybe, its my first stop. SUPER friendly and knowledgeable staff that focus on what you are looking for and making you their priority. I was chatting with the owner Larry and he is honestly one of the nicest people I have met since moving to AZ.  Thats customer service at its best!  If I could, Id give them 10 stars but I cant so 5 will do. Go check out these fine folks running a family owned business full of awesome goods. So so much to see and so so much to buy. They got it all!!!

Heard about Green from alot of friends of mine who are vegetarian or vegan. Thought I'd take the family to try something new. Glad we did!  Ordering was very easy and before we knew it, the food came out, super fast and hot! My lady ordered the kung pao bowl with mock chicken and brown rice. The kids got a burger with cheese. I got the Big Wac. All the food tasted very fresh and filling. Super satisfied.   As a whole, this place was great. Super friendly staff and great food. We will for sure be making Green a norm on our food outings.

I live close by to this location and I stop there for gas from time to time. But the last time I went here to get my car washed, which was a week or so ago, will be my LAST time I get my car "washed" here.   I was in a time crunch so I took it here to get washed before I was headed to my company christmas party. I paid 25 for the wash package. Waited for my car to be done. Got my car and went home. Got out to check my car. I have two small kids and there were still dirty foot prints on the backs of my seats. I looked at the bottom of my front fenders and there was still road dirt and such that they "forgot" to clean. There was also a new scuff mark on my passenger side door that I had to take care of. I then spent another 2 hours rewashing my car to how I like it.   I've had to do this a few other times but this time was the final straw. I will not be returning to this so called car wash. I've emailed them many times complaining about their service and performance but no replies. I do a better job washing it myself anyway but when time is of the essence and you need a quality service done, sometimes it's best to just do it yourself.

Just moved to AZ and I wanted something authentic, New York style. Rays is right down the street from me and I pass by it all the time! I decided to try it. WOW! Blown away!!  I had a large pizza to share with my family. The food is major quality. Crust was crispy outside and sot inside. The Cheese was real good anf melted. The toppings were fresh. Probably some of the best pineapple I've had on pizza. Still crunchy like it was freshly sliced!!! The wings were cooked to perfection and mildly spicy. The Cannoli was awesome too!!!  Very high recommended if you want that real, new york style pizza. You wont go wrong!!!

Never in my life have I experienced a more easier and courteous car buying experience. Chapman Hyundai did just that. From the start, Tim Mitchell and J.R. treated me with so much respect and had awesome service. He made it his goal to get me into a car that suited me at a payment that is reasonable. The finance team was stellar and so so awesome. They stayed late to get everything finalized for me and honestly just took really good care of me. I'm now in a 2014 Santa Fe and I couldn't be happier.  My kids have a safe car to get around in! Thank you!!!

These folks were and are awesome! Loved to food and the hospitality they offer. My tattoo shop had a benefit early this month for Cystic Fibrosis and we wanted to have a food truck to feed all of our guests. Not only we they punctual but they make great food. I had the Chubby Checker and the mosh fried. Out FREAKING standing!! Very fresh tasting food with great flavors all around. Fully recommend these folks for your private function or if you see em around, stop! You won't be disappointed.
