The staff here is very helpful!  I've taken my bikes in for minor repairs & purchased accessories. They are a friendly & knowledgeable group.  There was no hesitation when I purchased a helmet & needed help with adjusting the fit. I'll definitely return for my bike needs and future purchases. I'm not going to lie, I prefer to buy used bikes only because they're more affordable, but I wouldn't hesitate to support this shop whenever!

This is the best store in Old Town to shop for jewelry. They have so many pretty and unique pieces that it's hard to just decide on a few things. One thing I can say is that the prices are definitely better than others in the neighborhood.  For me though, what really keeps me coming straight back here everytime is the owners. They are friendly and knowledgeable. He goes above and beyond where customer service is concerned and will go out of his way to help. I've seen him switch the type of backs on a pair of earring for a customer until it was just what she wanted. They love what they do and love their customers. They are so sweet and funny and treat you like part of the family.  I'll keep going back for whatever I need. Perfect place to get gifts for anyone.

Loved the pizza here. We've had the blanco, Brooklyn and the one with pineapple and ham. Brooklyn is my definite favorite. I find a lot of places are hit or miss with a white pizza, this one was pretty good though. As a beer lover, they had tasty beverages from one of our favorite local breweries Phoenix Ale Brewery. Great pairing!

Went here for drinks with he spouse on a Tuesday afternoon. We didn't try the food so can't speak on that. It was gorgeous out so asked to sit on the patio. Short wait for that. We definitely enjoyed people watching from the upstairs patio on Mill.  The beer was good. Between us we tried the Pilsner, Marzen and Maibock. The latter two hit the spot for me, even if the Maibock was a bit sweet. It was exactly what I needed then. What I loved was the 21oz servings of the beer and since we went on Tuesday at happy hour, each set us just $2.50! I gotta say, this alone will be bringing us beer drinkers back for more and we'll definitely be trying the food next time! There was a regular running group meeting there as well so I am looking forward to checking that out.

Best pollo fundido and margaritas I have had in ages! I had given up on finding a good margarita. They were good enough to go for the pitcher. Thankfully,  I wasn't driving. The food was incredible. I plan on going back here everytime I'm in the neighborhood!

This is my new favorite movie theater! The remodel has made this place the most comfy place to curl up and watch a movie other than your own home! The seats are so huge and plush! With just the touch of a button the foot rests move up and down for your perfect comfort level. Also, if you are there with a loved one, the very wide arm rests lift up for a perfect snuggle session! The seats are also so big you don't feel like you're anywhere close to your neighbor. One bonus for me since I am hearing impaired is they offer BOTH headsets and closed caption options. I still can't hear with headsets so the closed caption system, which fits into your cup holder, was perfect!  The staff we have encountered here are also very friendly and eager to be helpful. At least that has been our only experience. Top Notch! My hubby and I both agree that this was our go to place for movies from here on out.

I really love the selection of subs here. The choices on the menu are different than what you typically find in a sub shop. There's definitely great hot and cold sandwiches here. My husband is a much bigger fan of this type of fast food and this is definitely his favorite sandwich shop. That being said, I really enjoy the food here. One thing I am impressed with is one of the employees is always an absolute delight. He has the best attitude and demeanor and makes going in for a bite here a treat.  I have never sat inside the shop as we usually get our food to go. There are also a few tables outside and I'd think this is the better option, if the weather isn't bad, than sitting in the little space that is this restaurant.

By far the best Rubio's we've been to. The food is perfection here at the Riverview location.  I've been to other locations and the burritos never come close. Usually, you get too much filler in the form of rice and beans with sparse protein. If I wanted that, I'd go to Chipotle!  Riverview Rubio's definitely packs the meat into their fare.  My favorites are the shrimp or chicken burritos and the salmon or ahi tacos. Enchiladas are okay too.  Service is always the deciding factor for me though and the staff and manager John are definitely ahead of the pack!

I have mixed feelings about this salon.  Upon entering I actually had to wait to be greeted while a regular who walked in at the same time was attended to. I don't mind waiting, but acknowledgment would have been nice The lovely young lady behind the counter was polite, though not overly friendly. I had an appointment so my appointed stylist came to greet me. She was very friendly! I loved her energy & enthusiasm right off the bat as we discussed what I wanted done. It's a nice space, the shampoo stations are great and relaxing. Honestly, one of the shortest head massages I've had, but good none the less.  The only argument here is that I feel she didn't have any experience with curls. She tried, but curly hair is notoriously difficult for someone who's not accustomed.  She offered to blow my hair straight, but seriously, women pay a fortune to get curls like mine so umm no. I've been around salons my whole life as my step mother owned several and has been in the extension business for decades (how I know what people pay for these curls) I did expect a bit more. I take full responsibility for not discussing that I need someone who can work with my hair type in advance when I made the appointment. I've never forgotten that step before and it did bite me in the end. Again, the stylist was a dream! I think her name was Kayla. I would recommend her to another hair-type in a heartbeat! She loves what she's doing & is eager to please.  I did walk away with a bit of a "pyramid head" lol. I'll have to wait until I get some more length to have that fixed. Meanwhile, I'm rocking some ponytails!  I do like the space, if I do go back I will discuss my needs in advance to see who I can be paired up with. Once you find someone who can handle spiral curls, hold on to them!

Hubby and I went to the Mushroom on Mill for Happy Hour. We had been there before, but never took advantage of the HH specials - half off drinks and apps.  This is definitely the times we will go back over and over for.  The food is good, though not necessarily great. During previous visits, we usually ordered a pizza and a beer or two. Any other time it seems as though the cost for this is usually a but higher than I would normally like.  During HH we were able to order a couple of things off the "Munchies" menu. 10 wings for me (under $5) and spinach dip with pitas for him (under $4) and we were able to have about 3 craft beers each. For all this, we paid much less than if we would have just gone out for a pizza. Bonus - We used a groupon $10 for $20 and it applied during HH!!!  The tap list is pretty decent as well.. Definitely not bad for a chain restaurant. Good stuff and they seem to update on taphunter.  The staff is a bit hit or miss at times with friendliness/attentiveness, but this trip we got to meet and chat with the manager Aaron. He is a superstar!! He was so friendly and nice and made us feel so welcomed and like we were old friends/regulars! He knew his craft beer as well and was able to recommend something amazing for my hubby who gave him 2 thumbs up. I really loved his demeanor and honestly, I will return to this Mellow Mushroom again and again because of him and those HH specials!

Hubby and I go to this brewery occasionally when we are in the area. We both love it. The beer is good, we have very different tastes and there's something for each of us here. We have never tried the food as we usually stop in for a quick pint. I think our favorite part are the people behind the counter serving. The lovely lady Margarita is always friendly and George is great to chat with as well. We will continue to go back.

Great and friendly service. The guys gave my car a good scrub down with brushes and then had me pull aside to finish drying the car.  I got the  $8 basic wash and I'm happy with it. I'll be back for sure.

The ambiance of this place is pretty good.  It has the typical sports bar feel and lots of TVs. I haven't been here in summer, so I have always asked to be seated on the patio where you can see all the TVs if you're interested and still hear the person you're with if conversation is more what you're after. The food was great! I am a sucker for a great burger and a great beer. Definitely one of my favorite burgers anywhere. The best selling point for me here is that that actually get it right on the cook! I cannot stand an over-cooked burger (read: well-done) and usually have a very hard time finding a place that can consistently get it right! I haven't been disappointed here yet whether I am in the mood for "medium well" to "still mooing" and anything in between. I would like to point out that the burgers are a bit pricier than your average bar burger. I have had the french dip here as well, and it was better than any of my other recent experiences in other places. I was about to swear off ordering french dip, but I might be convinced to hold on a bit longer. The beer list was great! Definitely something I think anyone can find something tasty on. I love being able to enjoy a tasty burger while enjoying a range of IPAs so I had a nice section of good beer to choose from. However, here's my complaint... chilled glasses! I realize that if you're just ordering a domestic lager from one of the Big Boys, then a chilled glass may be preferred. I mean, hey, those things haven't much flavor to begin with! But, when you have quality beers on the list, please honor my request for a NON chilled glass! Also, when ordering bottles, I request a glass with my beer. I have had to Remind my waitress several times that I have been waiting on a glass, and please oh please can you find me one that isn't chilled. Nope, I usually hold the empty glass in my hands to warm it up before I pour my beer. I love places that have a great beer selection for those of us who enjoy craft beer, but please know that there are appropriate ways to serve different things. It's not a deal breaker though, and I guess I can wait a few for things to warm up a bit before I start consuming. All in all, I do like this place and will return whenever I'm in the area, but the waitstaff can definitely use a bit of improvement in terms of friendliness, helpfulness, attitude.

Never going back! My margarita had zero tequila! I'm not exaggerating; zero! It cost me $6.00 when the sign says well drinks during happy hoyr are $4.00. When I asked about it, they told me "well" drinks ARE DRAFT BEER! I said no, it's the crap tequila, vodka, run, etc. in the WELL! Not that there was an ounce of tequila in the drink! We were handed a sheet of specials. We each ordered the burrito combo marked at $5.99. I asked for chicken, hubby asked for pork. We both got chicken. Ok, thanks! Not sending it back in a place where there's an obvious language barrier.  We're charged $15.98 for both our plates. Again, I ask why? I'm told the prices on the specials ended at 3pm. So why even had us that sheet? She points to the fine print on the bottom that says prices end at 3pm. My bad! I assume since I'm handed the sheet of specials, then there's some specials!  The food was terribly boring and I bit into an incredibly hard, black thing. I showed it to my husband and we couldn't figure out what the heck it was. At this point, I just want off this ride! My biggest regret of the day was walking past the Filibertos in the same parking lot to get to this place. I would have at least enjoyed my meal, gotten better service, and paid quite a bit less.  Please take me back Fili, I won't stray again!

The food is mediocre, but could be forgiven if the service was better.  The fries were so over salted I only ate about 2 or 3 before they were discarded.   The employees just don't seem to care!   The guy at the table next to us opened his burger to find everything but the beef! His burger was literally missing the beef patty! Serious lack of attention to detail here.

I am definitely a fan of the wonderful tap and bottle lists here. The beer selection is very impressive, which makes me a happy girl! Seriously, I can't say it enough... great selection! I didn't order any food since I am the rare weirdo who doesn't usually eat when I just want a pint or two. I'm prefer to nibble on something salty/crunchy so I have room for more beer. Maybe in the future when I stop in to Riverview for a movie I may stop in for a pint and a nibble.  The place is a bit small and seating feels a little awkward. Staff isn't overly friendly, but they are pleasant enough. I'll definitely be back to enjoy that tap list, most likely during happy hour!

I went to 3H to have extensions put in on the recommendation of a friend who had hers done there about a month earlier. She raved about the service and price, so I had to check it out myself.  The shop is located in that cute little hideaway area on Mill, which is like a little oasis in itself, just a few steps from the lightrail stop (3rd & Mill Ave).  It is definitely a cozy little shop with samples of the different types of hair, for every hair type & texture, hanging that you can touch and feel for yourself so you can have an idea of what you want. I appreciate that it was all 100% human hair.The lady doing the extensions, Toni, is very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. We had great conversation during the hours I was in her chair getting my hair done. It turns out she has been in the business for a very long time. I definitely felt like she was experienced and knew what she was doing.  I also agree with my friend about the cost of the extensions; definitely more affordable than I have seen elsewhere, especially for the product and service. The quality of the hair itself is exceptional; very pleasing to the touch & feel.  On a more personal note, Toni really takes the time and finds out what you want & need for your lifestyle and she really takes care of you. I'll be back!

I LOVE this event! Whether you're a serious runner, just getting started, or a walker looking to change up your routine, Adventure Run is a great event. The best part about it, other than being completely FREE, is that it isn't a set course or distance so everyone, regardless of ability, can participate. You start off by going through a mini expo and trying out gear, tasting samples, or checking out various local races and you get to earn raffle tickets as you go along. Then, they drop a map and it's up to you to find as many of those checkpoints listed as possible in an hour to get even more raffle tickets. Fast runners can go the distance and get a great, fun workout, while walkers are still able to get to the closer checkpoints. At the end of the hour, everyone returns to Road Runner Sports for a huge raffle! The prizes never disappoint and always include a free pair of shoes for some winners! I also love that you can get delicious craft beer at this event for $1 a pint and that all goes to charity! Let's face it, what other point is there to running than having a cold beer at the end. I can't imagine a better way to spend an otherwise boring Thursday night! All the runners are so friendly and it's so easy to meet new people and make new friends! I always recommend it to people who are new in town and this is Phoenix; there's always someone new in town ;-) My tip would be to register ahead of time to get an extra raffle ticket at check in.  They also have this event at the Scottsdale store so that makes for 2 great Thursdays a month!
