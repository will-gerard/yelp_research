I loooooove this restaurant!! The food is fantastic, and the prices aren't bad as well! The location is a little scary (downtown Phoenix) but don't let that deter you from an awesome Mexican food experience!!!

Living in this area I frequent Desert Ridge a lot, and have been to this Macaroni Grill several times... their food is actually pretty good which is why I let the horrible service slide a few times... My friend and I have had experiences such as standing at the host stand with no assistance for several minutes while several employees made eye contact. Of course, no one asked if we had been helped, until the hostess finally made her way back up to the stand and decided to ignore us for another couple of seconds before she even acknowledged us.   Another visit we were seated right away however it took over 15 minutes for our server to come to our table, and that was only after I had to get out of my seat and find one of the employees to ask for our server. I know several people saw us just sitting there, the least they could have done was asked if we had been helped or not.   This last experience, was about a year after the last. I thought maybe they would have changed. I most definitely thought wrong! We were seated promptly and the server was there right away this time. However, our food took FOREVER! Literally, it took over 30 minutes for a medium rare steak and a plate of pasta. I know for a fact they messed something up and ended up taking food out of a to go container and placing it on the plate that they then brought to me (you can see right into their kitchen from the dining room). The server never apologized nor did she come and tell us what the hold up was.   Overall, I will never go to that restaurant again.

Between the two of us my mom and I have 5 dogs who need to be groomed regularly. We have used this Petco to do this for some time now. I was hesitant to return to them after my dog was burned by their clippers (if they are used too long they get hot, need a spray to cool them down typically) however, my mom convinced me otherwise and for a while they did a pretty good job.   Unfortunately, this last time we used this will be the last time. I would not step foot in that store again. My mom dropped our dogs off at around 10 and the groomer said it would be about 5 hours (sounds about right, and hour per dog), at around 2, I believe, my mom received a call asking a question about one of the dog's cuts and it was then she was informed that there was one dog left and he should be done in an hour or so. At around 6 pm we were a little worried and decided to go check on our pups.   When we got there there was absolutely NO ONE in the grooming salon. The lights were even off! We had to walk out into the actual store to find someone to help us. That woman was very helpful, however they couldn't find the groomer!!!! Took them about 10 minutes to find her. Meanwhile we demanded our dogs back so they could go potty! Poor things were in there for 8 hours, and the staff cannot walk them. They finally found the groomer and turns out my 90 pound Goldendoodle STILL  had not been groomed!!!!! So we waited while the groomer and the manager went at poor Teddy with two sets of clippers. My Yorkie still needed his "finishing touches" as well, however, since he is 16 years old I did not have the heart to put him through that again.   I guess they were understaffed that day, however they shouldn't have taken that appointment if they couldn't handle it! The dogs who were actually done had patchy cuts and their nails weren't clipped either.  Worst part..... We still had to pay for most of it! We will be using another groomer, rest assured.

I love this salon! They are always super friendly and accommodating, even if they are busy. Their staff is very friendly and they do a wonderful job on my nails. They are very clean and even use the plastic tub liners for the pedicure tubs. They don't have to do this, however they have decided to step up the precautions to ensure the sanitation.  The designs they do are always super cute though.

YUMMMMMMY! I love, love, LOVE Sprinkles! I am addicted to their black and white cupcakes. The cake is always so moist and flavorful and their icing is simply to die for! Plus, my pups love their dog treats! :) The only reasons they are getting only 4 stars is simply because they are so expensive, and if you don't go early in the day all the good ones are gone! Boooo! But even the "bad" cupcakes are delish!!! It's a win-win.

I love Sushi Brokers! They have the BEST Happy Hour! Their drink specials are off the charts. I am not a huge sushi person.... However my best friend is... So good thing they have a diverse menu with lots of choices. Their burger is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I know right?? An awesome burger at a sushi joint... Weird right?? But it's delish! If you're in the area... Check it out!

My coworkers and I go to Blu a lot for lunch! We are addicted to the food. Their burgers are so awesome! They have a huge variety of different types of meat anything from black angus beef to bison. The burgers are fantastic! Now for your side... Try to zucchini fries YUMMM! The way Blu is decorated is pretty cool, offers an interesting dining atmosphere. The staff is always super friendly as well!   The only "negative" things I would say is sometimes there are not enough servers on to accommodate the busier times and the service suffers a bit. The other staff such as the bus boys and managers do help out though. Also, it is a tiny bit pricey. I will say that the quality of the food does make it a go to place! I highly recommend trying Blu out if you are in the mood for an AWESOME burger in a super cool environment.

If I could give this place less than one star, I would. My family and I had the WORST experience ever in this restaurant. My friends and I frequent the Kona at Scottsdale Fashion Square and we love them! So when we were looking for dinner by our house my dad suggested we go to this Kona, I jumped at the opportunity. BIG MISTAKE.   We walked into the restaurant and after a few minutes were greeted by a hostess. She said it would only be about 10 minutes, which was fine with us, so we waited. About 10 minutes later I looked around and there were several open tables, I figured the servers just needed a moment to catch up, so we continued to wait. However, 20 minutes after we were still waiting... The hostess said she would bus the table and we would be seated shortly. She started busing the table then left to talk to a gentleman, who I am assuming was the manager. After talking to him, she finished busing the table. Looking around the front room; I could see at least 5 open tables. However, we were still not taken to the table she had just finished cleaning off.   After waiting for over 30 minutes she finally took us to our table, where the hostess took our drink order saying our server would be right with us. The server stopped by about 5 minutes later to say she would be right with us. Where we waited for 10 additional minutes for someone to take our order. Needless to say, after spending almost an hour being ignored and not given service we decided they did not want, not did they deserve, our business. We left $5 on the table to cover the soft drinks ordered and left.   The absolute lack of organization and customer service at this location is appalling, and management needs to seriously reevaluate their practices. We will never be back.

This location is by far the best of chipotle!!!! The staff is all super friendly, they make work fun! I have been here a few times and tonight was awesome as always! One employee in particular (I didn't catch her name, but I wish I did so I could give her a shout out!) was super energetic and joking with everyone. If they didn't have a smile on their face approaching the counter, they did after their encounter with her!   The food is delicious as always.... My favorite oddly enough is their chips and salsa! They have, by far, the BEST chips. YUMMMMMM!

Yep... One star! This place is a doozy. I will never come back. The girls and I decided to get together on a Sunday for happy hour. We wanted to go somewhere a little different than our usual, but in the same general area. I thought of this place because a friend of mine used to work there. So we looked on their website to see what time happy hour was. They had one at the right time so we decided to check it out.   We were nicely received, however when our server came to our table she seemed like she was annoyed that she had to help us. We asked what was on the happy hour menu; her response, "it's Sunday, we don't have happy hour." We mentioned that the website said they did, her response "it's wrong." No sorry about that or anything. So despite the let down on happy hour we decided to go ahead and order.   When the food got there we were missing my friends pretzel bites.... No explanation. Our server didn't even check on us and we had to flag someone down to ask about her food about 10 minutes later. It really is a shame the service was so awful, because the food and atmosphere are awesome!! Guess a lot has changed since my friend worked there. We won't be back.

Katz and Dogs is amazing! I am so happy I have found this place. I work in rescue and needed a place that was not only cost effective but safe! I asked around and did my research. I was referred to K&Ds by the President of the Arizona Golden Rescue, and after talking with their knowledgable and friendly staff I decided to go ahead and get two of my available rescues spayed. They did an amazing job on both of them!   I was so impressed by their facility, customer service, and overall care of the pups when it came time to get my own dog fixed and vaccinated this was the only place that came to mind! I recommended Katz and Dogs to a friend and he had the same happy experience.  I work in the dog community and have been in contact with many different veterinary services avenues, and I highly, HIGHLY, recommend taking your dog or cat here for routine vaccines as well as spay/neuter services!
