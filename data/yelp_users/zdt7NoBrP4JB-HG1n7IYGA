We spent 20 minutes here tonight waiting to be sat only to walk out...  We were told it would be about 15 mins. We waited patiently at the hostess stand, while a seemingly harried and unorganized staff ran around between the indoor and outdoor spaces. Various tables were empty and not being bussed, and another table was actually cleaned and ready. No clue what was going on...there was no one at the hostess stand, no apparent 'leader' to be seen.   Hoping it was just an off night...when I return to give them a second chance I still update my review

Always have a good experience here. I want to venture into almond nail territory and Mike gave me a beautiful set!

Just graduated from VW to Audi at Audi of North Scottsdale and the experience from start to finish was top notch. John Jimerton provided excellent guidance and customer service throughout the entire process which included trading in my VW. I wasn't able to take the new car with me the first night once I had settled on it due to time constraints, so they arranged for me to come back the next evening. Everything was ready to go for me and it couldn't have been any easier. I even got a follow up call and email. Overall highly recommended and would return for my next purchase.

HomeSpec handled the inspection for my recent home purchase in the most ideal way. The added complication of me purchasing a home from out of state was not a problem for them in the least. They had excellent customer service, follow up, and the inspection report was thorough and complete. Would recommend to family and friends/use again.

Staff at Pharmacy didn't acknowledge me at drop off counter for literally 15 minutes, purposefully avoiding all possible eye contact, serving people at the drive up window 10 minutes in. Last I checked this place is called CVS *PHARMACY*. Get your customer service together, TERRIBLE!

For the love of God, please tear this location down or revamp it. The adjacent Campus Vista neighborhood is well kept up and this eyesore only serves to make the neighborhood seem run down and sketchy. There is always a security guard out front and a constant cast of unsavory characters every time I reluctantly venture in. Please make better use of this great real estate!

I recently moved from the Bay Area and considered myself to be a foodie there. The Tuck Shop was first on my list to check out to see if Phoenix is able to make food on par with Oakland. The answer is a hearty - YES!  I've been here a total of three times and they are simply consistently awesome in every way. Firstly, service is top notch. If you have a wait to be seated they have an awesome waiting area where you can sit down and order a cocktail, or you can grab a drink from the bar and wait in the outdoor seating area.   The food is unique, well prepared, and the menu changes regularly which makes me want to keep coming back. Ingredients are always fresh (even the seafood which was a concern of mine).   I really enjoyed their prixe fixe Valentine's Day dinner menu. Even though we got sat at the bar (last minute reservation), the experience was still just as good. Our bartender was super friendly and attentive.   Looking forward to their next menu and many more awesome nights!

Everything about my out of state move to the Bay Area with Just In Time was as easy as it could be from estimate to delivery. I had a great crew headed up by Jeff and two very hardworking partners who made me feel like my friends were helping me move. I threw a lot of questions and scenarios at them (possibly stopping at storage, needing a trailer for unsold furniture, not having a delivery address initially, adjusting the delivery date and time more than once) and through it all they were flexible and helpful. Their pricing couldn't be simpler and Jeff was super communicative and courteous. Not one of the large glass items I had were broken, all large electronics work perfectly, and so far during unpacking not one broken item! You're a fool if you pick any other company!

As is my experience with all Dutch Bros locations, the staff is super friendly which helps when you are up early. Despite their usually long lines, I always get in and out very quickly. If they are really busy they will have a runner come out to take your order. If I had this job I would forget after the second car - how do they do that?!  Location-wise I find it is best to come in on the Camelback side.

When I had made the initial call for a fix to my exterior sensor floodlight, Mike swung by within 10 minutes to take a look and provide an ETA for the fix. I awoke the next morning a to a ring at my doorbell announcing he was done. All I had to do was show him the location and he took care of the rest. Awesome.  I definitely plan to call on Mike for future projects!

I didn't end up going with these guys due to scheduling conflicts on my end but they were incredibly accommodating in willingness to work with me as well as reasonably priced.  Even when I canceled my walkthrough I was treated with respect and offered a 'let us know know if you need anything' - thank you for the awesome customer service!

Really impressed! Super professional, talented and friendly artists who clearly enjoy what they do.   Vicky was very meticulous and improved upon what I already had. Definitely worth the extra bit of driving, It's a great feeling to treat yourself and they make it happen!  Nerd alert: I especially appreciate how there is an option for the nail techs to stand while working, given all of the recent coverage on how unhealthy it is to sit for lengthy periods of time.

I needed a moving company within 7 days and Brandon made it happen. He was out of town for this particular move of mine back in August but he sent three guys who came in and killed it. I wasn't even done wrapping some things and breaking down furniture and they effortlessly went from room to room prepping everything and loading the truck. Before I knew it, I was racing them to the new place. All was said and done within a few short hours, and the rates were very reasonable and easy to understand. No hidden fees or anything crazy. They keep it really simple (like your friends are helping you move) which was a nice change.

Can't say enough good things about TNP  - I called for an emergency gate (creepers in the back alley) and Jim came out within an hour of my call to give me an estimate - Received an estimate within 20 minutes after we talked about my security and design needs - I was given an ETA of 3 days - he came out a day early with a helper and they had beautiful composite wood gates for the back and side of my fortress installed within an hour  Not only did all this awesome stuff happen, but he also noticed that my front door lock was not working properly and offered to install one for me.   Professional, on time (early, actually), and easy to work with for a reasonable price. What more could I ask for? Highly recommended!

I started seeing Bonnie in the late summer of this year. Since then, Bonnie has taught me incredibly important lessons in all facets of my life - professional, relationship, parenting, and most importantly understanding how I communicate with myself mentally and physically in each case. She provides the tools to improve thought processes but the real work starts after the session. Bonnie is both down to earth and incredibly wise. Her program is well organized and every minute is valuable. If something is top of mind for me she is able to switch gears and provide support where it is needed. I know there is so much more to learn and I look forward to continuing on this path of self-improvement. I highly recommend her to anyone looking to live a fuller life.

It feels odd writing this review for a business when my two experiences made me feel as if I was getting an awesome massage from a friend. Ani is warm, friendly, attentive, and strong. She did a sports massage the first time to help me with some trouble spots during my half marathon training. The recovery massage was gentler and perfect for post-run stressed out muscles. I am sad I found Ani right before moving out of state as she's fantastic. I hope to book a session next time I'm visiting AZ. Thanks Ani!

I order delivery from GrubHub and it always arrives on time. Always delicious, generous portions that taste like like a home cooked meal. Thank you!
