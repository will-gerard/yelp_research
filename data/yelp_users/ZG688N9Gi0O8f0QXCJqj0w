This store needs to get to it together. I will never come back to this location, ever. I waited 45 minutes for my first order the first time I came and they ran out of what I wanted so I didn't leave happy the first time...and this 2nd trip was the cherry topping- I called in my order to avoid having to wait..and make sure they would have wanted. 2 Asiago bagles with butter. Nothing complicated. They said ok and I got there...paid...and they made my order...waited another 30 minutes for the guy to call me over and say "Hey we don't have any Asaigo bagels"...my jaw hit the floor. Then why why did why did I why did I pay for that? And I wait 30 minutes to find this out? His response was the worst part..."I had 3 people call out today". That sounds like a personal problem & flaw in your business operation. I ended up grabbing the bag of plain bagels that I sufficed with and left the location telling the manager to their face I will never be back. Really disappointed Einsteins. No effort to recorrect my order.

My heart aches when I have to miss a Tuesday...I love every single staff member here as if they were my family. Tyler at the bar ...man you hook it up with hands down the best service in the industry!  Can't thank you enough for the friendly service, the amazing bruchetta..and even better wine! Again,  I love you postino! Thank you for making my date night surreal every Tuesday.

My checkout attendent Danielle was rude & unhelpful. The engraving machine is cool though.

Love this place, short wait on a Sunday. .friendly staff and great food! Not to mention they have mimosas! I came here a while back and they seemed tight and cramped for brunch...now I can tell they've done a renovation that really opens everything up and accommodates more. Well done BC!

Brendan behind the bar is awesome!  Slow Sunday or busy Sunday this guy rocks it! He is full of knowledge for the menu as well as the surplus of beers. He is friendly, and all around provides great service. The French dip, sweet potato fries  ( with the maple bacon dipping sauce) and french onion soup is all amazing...Thank you for the enjoyable dinner!

Not sure why all the reviews seem to be negative for this place. Yvonte is a deep tissue therapist here and he was able to lighten up and give me the perfect treatment for me! The reception was friendly and Nathan even looks like a mini J.Bieber  (I giggled a lot when he was doing my consultation for problem areas) the only suggestion I have (which will inevitably go against their selling techniques) would be to have the encouragement for sign up before the treatment -add more perks whatever it takes, but the last thing I want to do after I've zenned out and had a relaxing massage is be encouraged to sign a contract for a membership. I want to walk out and go continue relaxing. Just my opinion ! Take care of payment and encourage to enroll beforehand-  then let people soak in the beauty of relaxation after their massage

I Love sushi brokers they have a great tootsie maki roll that is to die for and their chicken fried rice must be made with love because I'm addicted. I'll order to go and sometimes it's a little lunch busy and I can tend to be forgotten about picking up food but otherwise- hit this place for happy hour and you won't be disappointed !

This is hands down my favorite store. It's priced appropriate for healthy & fresh food and the service is the best there is. Also, to the sweet employee who bought my flowers for me & said "pretty girls deserve pretty flowers" you made my week. Thank you for passing on your kindness. I will pay it forward and pass on the love like you do! Also, I'll be back to get your name and make sure you're recognized for providing the best service in the biz. Thanks Trader Joes!

These people are so friendly. I have a Starbucks in my resort and the people are amazing there too. I chose to come to this location out of my way because of the service & great smiles in the early morning.  Thanks guys!

I've always gone to the location in Arcadia (which I love) but this location is amazing too! What a beautiful patio with the fireplace in the middle & the best bruchetta around. Cant beat their $20 bottle & board deal here. So wonderful!

Complete waste of my time all I wanted was a maple doughnut, waited behind 4 people in line patiently with one cashier to find out they don't have any. No doughnuts, no maple bars. Nothing.  Furthermore, the cashier said "yeah, we are always out of those on the weekends. Sorry".  Sorry, but you're a doughnut shop..figure it out.

Nicest people here I swear.. This isn't just a tanning salon this is a place where people ask you how you're doing, how your day was ...and they genuinely mean it. I travel easily 15 plus miles to go to my resort tanning and spa being that I'm in the middle of two locations.  I'm sure I could go anywhere to tan but I choose to come here! keep up the amazing service guys and I'll keep coming to see you thank you for everything.

5 stars in my book! I came back and brought my mom..which means big things ;). They have my fave Zin- Manifesto,that plus their Zinburger..can't be beat. Especially before a movie across the street or some shopping in the Biltmore. See server-Marcus- he'll make sure you're taken care of. Thank you!

I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Dr. Kayce and everyone who works with Paradise Valley Foot & Ankle. To this staff you are not just another person being seeing with foot or ankle issues...You are a loved & cared for patient!  I am a ballerina, and Dr. Kayce carefully removed a bone spur from my right foot. He has changed my future in dancing and now I can perform with my Company. Thank you to the amazing staff in this office for talking me through this and helping me continue to do what I love pain free! You are the best!

Actually rather dissapointed with my experience.  I work at the hotel down the road and order for the whole office all the time..Im a huge fan of JJ. However, today I went to pick up an order up vs delivery because I wanted a little sunshine/drive to break up my work day..had I known I wasn't even going to be greeted or treated the way I was I probably would have done delivery or just not ordered at all. I asked if I could split the order since I was picking up the order for 2 of us in the office. The girl snuffed and said she already rang it in and she couldn't do that. I said okay...and she took my card for full payment..she just sat there with my card after swiping and didn't say a word to me, just stared at me. I asked if it came with a drink or anything and she answered plainly with a "no" and I said that's fine but can I get a drink too?  She snatched my card again and placed a cup in front of me. Awkward! Not going back inside that place anytime soon. That's too bad.

Great spot to hang out and watch the game! Chicken fingers are awesome and burgers are even better! Great beer/drink selection and the vibe is cool. Service is good and they even have heaters on the outdoor patio for us in az that complain about anything being cold

Modern Grove looks better than it tastes. Pretty blan. Had the mushroom and swiss burger for $10 and it was meat, Mushrooms cheese, no onions And the seating / table process is confusing. They have a hostess stand that says please wait to be seated but yet as you wait everyone else comes in cafeteria style and sits down.  Would have been nice for the 5 employees who passed me standing aimlessly at their hostess stand to ask me if I needed anything.  Oh well, I'm in no hurry back.

I love my nail lady & now friend- Tracy Giang at One Woman Day Spa. She does the best mani, pedis, eyebrow wax and much more more. She is super affordable and its in a convenient location. I trust her with anything and have awesome conversations while getting pampered. Best of both worlds  thank you for the awesome service!

This location has officially disappointed me for the second time. I got the best customer service from Fashion square then had to make a return, so figured I would do that at this location. The lady at check out must have been having a bad day because being welcoming and helpful was the last thing on her mind. Therefore, my customer service I received took the hit. She was rude, and unhelpful. Also, I'm pretty sure I didn't get the correct credited amount back to my card. When I questioned her she said "well, I rang it in and this is what it came up". Got that, but look at the receipt please? It says I got a discount per my gift card? Nothing...   Sad, I'm an angel card holder and religious shopper here. I was thinking I would even be back to checkout the labor day sales this holiday weekend but if friends chose to go to Kierland this won't be a store I care to shop in again.

I can honestly say this is the best spray tan experience I've ever had. I had gone to planet beach prior to luminosity and they had me wait 30 minutes to use their versa spa or whatever machine they use. The they turned me away last minute before closing saying they couldn't help me. Blessing in disguise for sure! Because next I called the luminosity spray tan with Christy & the sweetest , most warm and engaging voice came over the phone. She said "what can I do to help?" & "when can you come?" Not...these are the hours I'm available. ..not once did she say no. Just accommodating & happy to assist. Service was an A+ and I haven't even stated how beautiful the tan was that I got from Christy & Luminosity spray tan. The product is clean, not sticky, bronze & natural ..not orange. After tanning here I will never tan anywhere else. I'm confident I've found the best place for a natural nice looking tan in the valley & best service to boot! Go check out Christy at Luminosity tanning. You won't be sorry.

This place is awesome- and it's even better on a hot afternoon when they are running their 2 for $20 deal! Get a decent size pizza and a crisp refreshing Caesar salad, and 2 glasses of wine for $20!! Amazing ! And to top it all the staff is so nice and accommodating at this location! If aren't happy they aren't and will make sure you get what you need to feel satisfied and full! Thanks Sauce! I'll be back soon-
