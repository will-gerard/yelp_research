I'm a total pizza snob. I've had a hard time finding great pizza here in the valley and Sardella's is now my go-to pizza joint.   :D  You can tell by the food and the service that this place is a family owned small chain and not a big commercial business.   There are plenty of toppings on every pizza. When I eat at large chain places I often feel like I got ripped off because the toppings are so skimpy. I've seen other reviews saying the opposite but I have been impressed every single time about my toppings. Well...almost every time...  Once I ordered a pepperoni pizza with half sausage. It was delivered and when I opened it, there was 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 sausage. It was a good amount of sausage, but it was supposed to be sausage and pepperoni on that half. I was disappointed bc this was the first time I've had an order messed up with Sardella's. I called and was passed on to a manager. He was great, and more than resolved my issue.   When I find a place with amazing management as well as great food, I'm thrilled. Sardella's fits the bill!    Only thing I dislike is picking up pizza there. The kids who work the counter are sometimes...socially awkward. It's also located between a liquor store and a creepy dive bar. There are lots of...I dunno...creepy looking dudes hanging out in front of the building smoking and such. I just get delivery most the time to avoid this. It's worth the extra money to me.

This location never really disappoints. The waitstaff is friendly, a manager always asks how things are. I stick with Outback because the food is consistently delicious.   Today I ordered an 8 oz filet, classic cooked, medium. When my steak came out it was...just not what I pictured it normally looking like. It didn't have the dark crusty seared outside. It was thin. It was cooked about medium well/close to well, and probably due to this it was tough. The texture was the worst part because I get the filet for the texture. Despite the fact that it's not usually the MOST flavorful cut, it's worth the sliiiiiight loss in flavor for the tenderness. The classic seasoning & sort of crunchy seared outside completely makes up for the lack of flavor compared with other cuts.   I am NOT the type of person who sends things back, however, my boyfriend confirmed my concerns by telling me that he didn't think it looked like a filet. So, when Andrew the manager came by and asked how things were, I quizzed him about what cut he thought it was. He got it right...8 oz filet. I told him I only asked because it wasn't what I was used to a filet looking/feeling/tasting like. He agreed that it wasn't ideal and insisted on getting me a new one. I told him it wasn't necessary, and if it was the filet I'd eat it despite the lack of the usual Outback perfection. Nope...Andrew wouldn't have that. He brought a new one. The new one was undercooked, but since Andrew waited to see the inside before leaving it with me, he promptly took it back to be fixed.    This time it was PERFECT. It was thick like a filet should be, and was cooked exactly medium...red in the center but not bloody. The searing was precisely what I always look forward to at Outback. It was the best steak I've had in a long time.  I was very happy with the way Andrew and our server Shelby made me feel like a valued guest and made me feel like it was OKAY to let them make my order perfect. I don't think I'll become one of those picky sender backer types, but it was nice to know that at this Outback location I don't ever have to settle for anything less than perfect.   Between Andrew and Shelby, this location has secured me as a customer and I will be back next time I want a fantastic steak!

I'm not a big bowler, but when friends want to bowl, I'm down. I've been to this location a few times and I'm not impressed. Where do I start?  HOURS: You'll see hours listed here on Yelp, and some different ones on their website, and some on the door to the business, but when you actually go in and try to bowl the employees tell you earlier times. They informed us that management is trying to save money so they have the employees close early. It was disappointing to think we had 2 hours to bowl according to the website, then actually have less than an hour.   PRICES: We bowled on a Saturday night for $15/person which included 2 hours of bowling and shoe rental. It went slightly into the fun ultimate bowling or whatever they call it here. The kind w music, fun lights, etc... We had some beer at almost $20 a pitcher, which is kind of expensive. On Tuesday, we weren't really sure what the price was. It kind of seemed like the employees weren't sure how much to charge us for only being able to bowl for 45 minutes because they were closing early. They decided between each other to charge us a total of $10.66 for everything (2 people & shoes). They didn't know how to ring it up though, which led us even further to suspect that this was just a price they made up on the spot.  LOCATION: Unfortunately this alley is located in a questionable part of town. On Sat night there were some creepy looking people loitering in the parking lot. I imagine that if the INSIDE attracted better people, then the outside wouldn't be as creepy.  So...I'll probably try to find a nicer bowling alley nearby if possible and will encourage friends to go elsewhere too.  If your'e the owner or manager, please read on:  I saw several ways that an employer could cut costs to save money without having inconsistent hours.  -Turn some lights off: if people are only using 4 or 5 lanes, and you're not allowing them to be spread out even if requested (we requested a lane away from other rowdy bowlers but were given a lane RIGHT between them) then turn lights off on the other 90% of the lanes not in use. Or turn off every other one for 1/2 the building. I don't know how the electric is set up, but it might be worth getting it set up to be able to do this. - Cut staffing down: There were more employees working than lanes being used. That's ridiculous. 4 people working to run credit cards, hand out shoes, and spray them down after they're turned in? That's a 1 person job IF that person knows what to do. Maybe 2 are needed for safety and for the instances where one has to walk down a lane to fetch a ball or something. If the concession guy is closing early, that's a whole additional person who is being paid to stand around, but isn't available to make you money. -Turn off the video games early: that sucks tons of electricity and if nobody is even remotely interested in using them why have them on? You could leave a sign saying to ask an employee if you want to use the games and they'll turn them on.  -Turn down the AC: it was freeeeezing in there. I think the temp could be turned up at least 4or 5 degrees which doesn't seem like much, but in a place that size might be a huge monetary savings. -Prevent theft: I think in order to prevent people suspecting they might be getting ripped off, and to prevent employee theft, you should just have listed prices and signage that gives that info in black and white. It made us uncomfortable to just have the employees throw out a price that seems random like $10.66 for 2 people for 45 minutes. -Offset the cost of operation by selling drinks and food! When we were there, the concession stand lights were off and they stopped serving everything at least 1/2 hour before the closing time which was an hour and a half before the posted closing time. Nobody had the opportunity to buy overpriced bowling alley food or beer. Big mistake management. Big.  I never think that closing early is good for a business. You're the boss though and I guess you can do what you want, but at least have some respect for customers by listing times as "may vary by night and number of customers at employee discretion" so that we have fair warning that we might not get to stay until the advertised times. It sucks to arrive somewhere to find that out.

I was craving a milk shake and this is near my boyfriend's job so we went for lunch one day. The food was...meh. I would enjoy a burger from just about anywhere else more. The fries were not good...soggy, not crispy, and bland. The milk shake did not satisfy my craving.   The "$5 Buck" lunch was a good price but the name was driving me crazy. If you say "buck" then do you need the dollar sign? Seems like it reads "Five dollar Buck" which...is redundant and doesn't make sense. But...that's not why the bad review.   There was a table of people behind us. They had a little girl with them, and I'm not good with kid ages but I would guess her to be 2 or 3 maybe? They kept walking back into the back of the kitchen with her...sometimes with a woman, sometimes a man. I assume they were the owners or something, right? None of them are dressed like they work there. They are wearing clothes that clearly don't meet health department specs...tank tops, hair hanging all over the place, open toed shoes, etc... They walked past customers in line, helped themselves to ice cream and stuff while customers had to wait to get their orders because these people were in the way. They didn't greet the customers. They didn't acknowledge the customers. That was bad enough, but then I go to the bathroom, and the little girl throws french fries over the booth into my purse. My boyfriend saw her doing it! After watching them walk around the place so rudely ignoring customers and cutting in front of them for service, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that their child would do something like that.   The only thing that gives this place the 2 stars I so generously gave was the other staff. They were suuuuuuper friendly and very helpful despite the owners getting in their way. Until the issues with the owners began, I kept thinking that even though the food was just...ok, I might start going here more often because the staff was so pleasant. Doubt I'll go back now just because I don't want to support those jerks.

So for...15 years I have described PF Changs to people as: "If I had to eat at a restaurant every day for the rest of my life, I'd choose PF Changs." Well...after my last several visits, it is no longer my favorite, and frankly, I don't even care if I ever eat there again.  The chicken lettuce wraps have always been a MUST for me...but the last several times I got them, they were a smaller portion and different somehow. I don't know if there is a change to the recipe or they messed them up every time....all I know is I didn't feel impressed with them like I used to. Many times in the past I would eat lettuce wraps as my meal because I liked them so much...last couple times I didn't even eat 2 wraps. :(  The shrimp with lobster sauce has always been my favorite. Sure, it looks like snot with shrimp and egg in it, but the flavor was always sooooooo good. Last time I went there were TONS of peas in it (there used to be just a few...enough to give it a hint of flavor and color), huge slices of mushroom that overwhelmed the flavor of the entire dish (there used to be little cubes that just gave it a teeny perfect touch of flavor), and when I asked about the recipe change the waiter said it has always been the same. Uhhhh....NO. No it has not, sir! I don't know how long you have been working at PF Changs but I have been eating the SAME DISH probably 80% of the times I have visited since 1999 when I moved here and discovered PF Changs. I can tell you that it is very very different and has changed within the last...6 months maybe. It's most certainly a change and not a good one. I didn't like it at all. To make matters worse, I ordered it on my birthday last month and didn't even eat more than a couple bites because I was so disappointed with the flavor. No use taking leftovers home when you have no interest in eating them either. It sucked.  The beautiful Asian decor has always been appealing to me...one of my favorite parts of eating there. I used to imagine how awesome it would be to have similar decoration in my own home. But...they've recently begun remodeling to some kind of snooty contemporary crap. I don't like it at all. Feels very cold and Scottsdale-ish.  On top of all this, there was the credit card debacle. I had to get a new card because of it. I know it's not their fault and they did everything they had to once they found out in order to prevent it from happening again. However, it was just another negative in about a 6 month line of bad PF Changs visits that put a bad taste in my mouth; literally and figuratively.  I don't know if PF Changs business was down or if customers expressed some desire for all these changes, but whatever the reason, they have lost me as a customer. I'm sad about this. It was my absolute fave for 15 years.

Was told 15-20 minutes to wait for a prescription.  It took over an hour.  We were told that we could wait and that our name would be called over the speaker when it was ready. We walked around the store for probably 15 minutes then sat in the waiting area right next to the pharmacy. My brother has pneumonia (which is why we were getting medication) and his oxygen was low, he just got off work and was tired, and he was coughing up a storm the whole time. Hard to miss that a big man is sitting in your waiting area looking like crap and coughing like hell.  The reason this is important is that finally after an hour I went back up to the counter to ask how much longer it would be (because he was really feeling sick and wanted to lay down.) I told the kid that I'm sorry to nag, but we were told 15 minutes and it had been an hour. He looked it up and said it was ready; they must have just forgotten to call it out.  WHAT??!!   Ok...even IF you forgot to call it our right away, how did none of the 5 or 6 people working there think "Boy, that man over there has been the only person sitting in our waiting chairs for about 45 minutes now, coughing his brains out and looking like hell...I wonder if he might be waiting for something...Oh shoot! We totally forgot to call it out!" Nooooope.  I have a prescription to move from my old pharmacy across town but I think I'm gonna cruise over to a nearby CVS and see if they can do better.   Peace out, Walgreens.

If you want the best BLT ever, come to Blimpie! The bacon is AMAZING...crispy, not chewy, and LOTS of it! I always get it on the parmesan bread...it's fantastic. I don't get other sandwiches there because the BLT is so darn good, but I've seen them make other kinds and they always slice the meats and cheeses fresh.  This particular store is not the closest to my house, but I drive the extra couple of miles because the one on Tatum and Shea isn't dependable. This one on 64th and Greenway never opens late or closes early. They are quick, polite, and affordable.   The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that frankly, I understand the opinions of the previous Yelpers about the owners' personalities. (Forgive me if I butcher the spellings, but Prasad and Sailu are the owners. They are Indian and they do have accents as such so you'll know if that's who you're talking to. At least one of them is there at all times. I have only ever seen 1 other person on shift at a time with them.   Personally, I am always relieved when Sailu is working as she is much friendlier to me than her husband is and she has great customer service skills. She always remembers what I want...even down to asking if I'm going to get "regular mayo or chipotle mayo this time". I love it. It makes me feel like she really cares about her customers. I love that she wraps my foot long as 2-6 inch sandwiches. This makes it easy for me to eat half right away and save the other half for later if I wish. Prasad...well...I think maybe it's a cultural thing about women that causes him to come across as kind of unfriendly to me. My ex bf and I used to go in a lot and those two men got along famously...but I see a completely different side of  Prasad if I go in now on my own. He makes my sandwich well enough, but he doesn't really speak to me and it's slightly uncomfortable. I'll still go in either way though because the BLT is THAT good.  PS: They have Pepsi products so I'm an even bigger fan. I don't normally get a soda, but if I do, I want it to be Pepsi. :)

I was taken out to the Cheesecake Factory tonight, & hadn't been in quite some time. The last time was at a different location...Biltmore. That was an awful trip & between that and a sexual harassment lawsuit at the chain around that same time, I honestly wasn't sure I'd ever go back. Well, tonight I did and I'm glad I gave it another shot.  Lets get the negative things out of the way first:  The hostess was not very friendly & made me worry that it had been a mistake to go back. The bartender seemed like he was not happy to be there or to talk to us about drinks. It was a little cold in the dining area, but seemed to warm up as the evening progressed.  Now for good things: Of course, I got the chicken madeira because I ALWAYS get it and it's ALWAYS delicious. I think the portions are getting a bit smaller these days, but I still had leftovers. Drinks were...meh. I would love if they had a better draught beer selection myself. None of the beers were too exciting so I got a martini and it was...drinkable...maybe. For those prices I'd expect better. Calamari was decent. Cheesecake is always great.   Food was good, but what made tonight's trip overcome the few negatives and past experiences and warrant a 4 star rating was the service. Mandy was great...very friendly and not snooty like some servers in the Scottsdale area can be. She also did not flirt with the guy I was with hoping to get more tips. I hate when servers do that.   There was one mistake by the kitchen where peas were added to a dish that was requested without them, but they realized before it even came out and Greg (who I can assume was the manager on duty) came over to apologize personally and offer a soup or salad while we waited. We appreciated it but declined the offer. Mandy was attentive and was taking good care of us so we really didn't feel like anything was much of a wait. She mentioned that she is fairly new, but had she not told us, we wouldn't have guessed.   Overall a great trip. I will likely put the Cheesecake Factory back on my list of restaurants to choose from on a regular basis. I recommend it. Ask for Mandy...she's good. :)

I have been to RA a couple of times at different locations. My main thought is that it is WAAAAAAAY overpriced. $10 for a well martini? REALLY?? One trip, I got 2 drinks, peppers, and one or two sushi rolls (which are relatively small), and I paid $60!! Yes...60 bucks for ONE person to not even get full! I then heard from a friend that happy hour is the best time to go...prices on happy hour items are a bit more reasonable. So...I went to the late night (10-close) happy hour last weekend.  We walked up and saw a few tables of people outside, and inside there were no more than a handful more...good, not too busy. There was one other woman waiting at the host stand so we stood behind her. We stood there...and stood there...and stood there.   Several times employees walked by; one even gave a polite little head nod which verified that none of us were invisible. However, even after several times of poking our heads around the dining area and toward the bar tender, no host ever came. We even walked around the fish tank at the entrance thinking maybe someone would come over out of concern that we were essentially BEHIND the host table. Nope!   After at least 10 minutes of being completely ignored we finally gave up and left. That other woman stayed. That was about a week ago. She very well may still be waiting there. We went to a different restaurant where we paid much less than we would have at RA (even at happy hour prices) and where we were served very quickly.  I have had it with RA. Food is expensive and the taste/quality is mediocre...more presentation than substance. They use tricks to make the food appear larger than it is...spreading out the pieces of sushi roll, garnishing with sauces and some items to make the dish appear taller. It looks nice of course, but when you're hungry, the aesthetics don't fill you up! Happy hour was my last attempt at allowing them to win me as a customer...and I never made it past the entrance.

I have not been to any Rubio's in a long time. I used to go so often that the manager at the location near where I lived (Keith at Power & Baseline) used to know my name and my order and as soon as I walked in he'd call back to the cooks to get some Mahi going. It was great back then. I moved away from the area and have since tried different locations. My last few trips to different Rubio's locations were pretty disappointing.  Today, that changed!  I was at work and needed to grab something fairly quick. I decided to give Rubio's another shot. I'm glad I did. Most of the staff was clearly new, because the manager, I believe he said his name was Will, was sort of micro-managing everyone. At first I thought maybe he was just a jerk of a boss. Then it became obvious that he was doing it because it was necessary. He double checked every single order that came out of the kitchen and corrected the cooks (nicely) on whatever wasn't just right. I liked that. It assured me that quality control measures were in place and that he was making sure that the staff learned how things need to be done.  The young man at the counter was very new and he seemed nervous at first but the manager kept giving him pointers and pep talks about getting orders correct and asking questions if he needed to. The kid did a great job, and even made helpful suggestions to me when I couldn't decide things about my order. He did great.  I was not only impressed with the staff, but the food was great this time! It was better than I've had at Rubio's in a LOOOONG time. It's how I remember things being years ago when I frequented Rubio's multiple times a week. I switched it up from the Mahi to the new Tilapia tacos and they were delicious. They were a good size, and the fillings were generous like they used to be. The last few times I had been to Rubio's the tacos were really sad and hardly had any fish in them. This time they were perfect and fresh.  There were only a few things I didn't like, but none that would keep me from going back: 1-the wait time was kind of long. However, I'd rather have freshly prepared food, that is made correctly, than to have something quick and be disappointed, so I let that slide completely. 2-the limes in the salsa bar were a little sad. You can tell when sliced limes have been sitting because they get brown around the edges of the peel...that's how these were. Fresh limes would've been nice.  3-the bathroom smelled gross. It was very small and didn't seem well ventilated. I don't necessarily think it was dirty, but it definitely didn't smell good. Perhaps a better fan or an air freshener of some kind might help.  For the people who talk about the management change, Will did mention to me that he has only been at that location since March, so if you went before that and had a bad experience, maybe give it another shot because I thought it was great today.  :)

Used to be good back around...1999-2000 or so. I had great memories and used to love the food there. However, more recently a bf who had heard me make good comments about the food, took me there and the food was not good at all. It was edible, but there was more of a "fishy" not fresh taste this time. I know not to expect most seafood in AZ to be as fresh as if we were on the beach, but it used to be great. They no longer had some of the menu items they used to. It just wasn't impressive and certainly didn't live up to the memories I had.  Good news is I no longer crave it and have to travel across town and spend the money to go there. :)

Needed to rent a dethatcher for the yard. I saw good reviews for this place, and I believe I bought a used mower there many years ago. Anyway...I called and spoke with Jordan, who gave me the info I needed to make a decision to come to Mow Power as opposed to going to other home improvement stores who also rent out this equipment.  The price was great. The dethatcher was...well it was my first time experiencing a dethatcher, but it was easy to start, in good shape with freshly sharpened blades (as shown to us by Caleb when we arrived to rent it). It definitely dethatched our yards!   I brought it back without my boyfriend and I needed help getting it out of the truck bed. The gentleman working helped me get it out and was very friendly. I feel bad I didn't catch his name but he was super nice and even let me slide on about 5 minutes late to return. :)  Good man! I really didn't want to have to fight about a few minutes and it was a huge relief that they used common sense and weren't jerks about it.   Because of the great customer service and the fair pricing and treatment, we will certainly go back for any future lawn care needs.   PS: I got a sweet rake there too. I'm short. So is the rake. I'm happy with it...as happy as one can be when raking in the summer in AZ. :)

READ THE FAQ section!!!!   It contains crucial information that if you don't have, you could just lose out on the money you paid for tickets.  No idea how there aren't more terrible reviews based upon the issue I had as well as the terrible...no...LACK OF customer service.  Here's what happened to me. I know it's long, but it explains exactly the type of customer service and the type of shady business this place is:  A buddy of mine was opening for some lady I've never heard of. I didn't care about the main act, but figured for $12 a ticket, I could sit through whatever came after his opening act, right?  Bought tickets the week before so I would be sure to have a ticket for the 8 pm show. This meant an additional $1 per ticket but I figured that was worth it to guarantee a seat.   Day of, I had to work until 4 and again at 8 am, so I decided 8 pm would be better than 10. Ended up at work late, got home, showered, go ready, and hauled ass to the club which was about 30 minutes away. Got there at about 7:57 but the parking lot was full so we drove to a nearby parking area and walked over.   As we were walking a couple was walking away and said kind of angrily, "They're all sold out for this show!" My boyfriend said, "Thanks, but she already bought tickets." The woman replied, "Yeah...so did we!"  Confused, we approached the doorman, printed receipt/ticket in hand. He informed us that they were sold out...  ME: Riiiiiight...but we have tickets!  DOORMAN: Sorry. You can either come back for the 10 pm show or email them for a refund.  Meanwhile, the woman who warned us and her date came back over to ask more questions. We were all very confused about how buying tickets to a show doesn't mean that you have seats at that show. The doorman explained with the manager or owner or whoever the chubby old guy is, standing right there, that they recommend that you come a half hour before the show and get in line. Anyone in the front of the line with tickets at that time will get in, then they'll sell any remaining tickets to people in line who didn't pre-purchase tickets.  So...there is really NO point in purchasing tickets before showing up because it makes no difference as to whether you get into the show. If people with no tickets show up before you and buy your seats, you're just out the money.  Because I had to work the next morning, I opted not to attend the 10 pm show. I verified with the doorman that I could email for a refund, and he said yes. I told him the info regarding this reselling already purchased tickets should be on the receipt or should be made known to you. He informed me that "it's on the website".  On the way home, my boyfriend got on the website and tried to find it. He eventually did...15 minutes later buried in the FAQs! I think that's BS. Why would I read all the FAQs if I didn't have any reason to? A warning that they can sell your tickets to someone who shows up at the door before you should be more obvious and should be volunteered to you before you agree to purchase anything.  In the FAQ section we also found the warning that sales are final and no refunds will be given at any time. Since the doorman had CLEARLY told us multiple times that we could email for a refund, I wasn't sure what to believe at this point. So...I called the club phone number. I figured if that were true, maybe we should turn back and try and make the 10 pm show. I got their voicemail and just left my name and number and requested a call back. I didn't even say why I was calling and they still never called back. Not that night. Not the next day. Not Monday morning. Not EVER.   The next day I emailed the club for my refund just as the door guy said. Again...no response whatsoever.   My next step was filing a complaint with PayPal who immediately escalated it. Eventually they informed me that they gave the club so many days (I believe it was...10 days maybe?) to respond to several requests by PayPal to address my issue. They never responded (shocker!) so PayPal refunded my money.   Luckily I was protected by PayPal and would've been protected by my credit card company as well. However, if it hadn't been for that, I would have been out $26 for a show I never saw.   I don't know if most people read the FAQ section for every restaurant, venue, theater, stadium, etc... they attend but I don't. I probably will now, but I still think it's shady. When you buy tickets to a movie, baseball game, concert, etc...those tickets are yours  whether you show up early, on time or even late. I didn't know there was any place that buying tickets didn't guarantee you a seat.

The deli/bistro in this store is awful. Customer service is non-existent. I have been here on many occasions because I work close by and every time I get helped juuuuuust as I consider leaving empty handed because I've waited so long while being ignored.  The first really bad trip was for breakfast. When I finally got helped, I ordered a number 1 from the sign. She said "well what do you want in it?" I said..."whatever the sign said was in a number 1." She replied that she didn't know, and couldn't see the sign so I should just tell her what I want. So, I chose a few items I saw in the hot case. She charged extra for biscuits & gravy...you'd THINK that if she knew those didn't come with a number 1, that must mean she has SOME idea what DOES. As she scooped my food, she proceeded to talk to a co-worker saying "I don't even know why we MAKE breakfast anymore. Nobody buys it. It just sits around & gets old, then we throw it all away." That's just what I like to hear when I'm buying some of it, right? When I got to work with my breakfast I found that she was right on the money: potatoes overdone and dried out, biscuits & gravy was gross, & eggs were crusty/dry and old.   My last trip was the final straw. I stood in line behind 1 man. After he was helped, the woman completely ignored me, walked over to another part of the counter, helped a lady there, then proceeded to chat with her about some guy they both know, the day they are having, etc... I waited until they were finished socializing. She finally came back, looked at me, then looked at the man off to the side BEHIND me, and asked if he had been helped. He said he was just waiting. So finally she asked if I had been helped. Uhhh...well lady, you're the ONLY one helping people and you have helped everyone BUT me including people behind me, so NOOOOOO...I have not. I got a single slice of pizza, which was not very fresh. I also stopped by the seafood counter before I left. I thought I might get some Cajun crab dip. I stood there for a while listening to the seafood lady chat with a customer about how the government sucks and the economy is bad...finally I left with no dip.  It is my understanding that Bashas used to be the only store in town. They must still think they are because they certainly don't act like there is any competition. Unfortunately for them. there are lots of other stores that I am more than willing to drive a little extra to get to from now on to avoid the crappy customer service here.

I ate here with a friend last week. The look of the restaurant was nice. The food was...ok. It's kind of pricey for what you get I think.  Drinks were expensive as hell, but strong. Of course, strong doesn't necessarily mean they taste good. The feztini was pretty much like a shot in a martini glass w sugar on the rim. Haha.   I had a turkey burger that was...a strange consistency. It didn't taste bad, but was the strangest consistency ground turkey I've ever had...more of a finely ground turkey paste really. The flavor was...ok. I tried to give a piece from my leftover burger to my cat at home and he wouldn't eat it. I was surprised because it was a cat food kind of consistency. Lol. The bread was a ciabatta bread that looked like it was going to be crusty and hard, but was surprisingly soft and delicious. I got sweet potato fries which were good. Unfortunately when I asked for a box, the server boxed it for me and didn't put the leftover fries I saved into the box. :(   Only other thing I feel might be worth a mention is the parking lot...it was reeeeeeally creepy and dark back there at night. There are nice lit up spots next to the restaurant, but they belonged to the FedEx next door and there were signs about them being for their customers only. So...I parked out back in the creepy dark lot with the strange river of what looked like sewage flowing through it.   All in all, I would eat here if other people were going, but I wouldn't make the choice to go myself.

I would give more stars if I could!!!! Super impressed and recommend this place to everyone I know!  Dr. Halterman and all the staff at VCA PV were sooooooo awesome. My kitty Maverick is overweight and most vets scold us about this first thing. Not here. They were non-judgemental and so caring. They talked about Maverick like he was important and like they enjoyed him being there. They honestly treat pets as part of your family...even calling me "the mom" which was cute. :)  I also received fantastic follow-up care. They forwarded all pertinent information to his regular vet at VCA McCormick Ranch and called me multiple times to make sure everything was well. I have also called once or twice with questions and I have never ever felt rushed off the phone. They are AWESOME!  Not only did they NOT upsell anything, I paid for services upon dropping kitty off and when I picked him up they gave me a REFUND for a couple of tests & meds that he didn't end up requiring. I didn't even ask about it first...it was just volunteered to me as soon as I came in. That impressed me very much. I felt like some places might just wait and see if you ask for a refund, but not here! Very honest.  Of course when you bring a pet into an emergency vet it WILL costa little more. It's the same with human docs. But it isn't unreasonable at all and in my opinion it's worth every penny to be able to bring your sick or injured pet somewhere for great care even when their normal vet is closed. I don't know what I would have done without this service being available.  Without a doubt I recommend VCA Paradise Valley Emergency Animal Hospital. Now if I can find a doctor for ME who is as great I'll be all set!

I've been to D&B a few times. Time before last was nice...despite lack of seating in the dining area. I had a burger, which was decent. We discovered they have Coronaritas. Now...they come in a small, non-fancy glass, but...they get the job done. Luckily I only needed one because I apparently got the last "Coronarita lid" so they couldn't sell any more after that. Maybe they should consider the special clips most places use. They're inexpensive and reusable. Just sayin'.  Anyway...this last Friday we went back for dinner, and some of that Coronarita action. This time we were able to get seated in the dining area. That sounds like a good thing right? Yeeeeeah...No.   We were seated in a creepy mirrored booth by an unfriendly hostess. Our menus were sticky and dirty...had to pry some of the pages apart like a high school boy's porno mag. Gross. Then...we sat. And we sat. And we watched servers walk by over and over...not even giving us a glance...for well over 10 minutes. We made our drink and dinner decisions...and nobody came to take an order. So...we finally just left and had a fabulous steak dinner at The Keg. :)    So...I generously give 2 stars because the first visit was okay. That second time though...only good thing about it was that we got to discover a very tasty steakhouse and try something new due to the lack of...well...anything besides being seated.

Don't know what the food is like but the employees are kind of rude. We walked in right around closing time and there were at least 20-30 people in the restaurant. We stood at the door for a few minutes then someone yelled across the room "We're closed. We open at 11 tomorrow."   Haha. Great. That's real helpful when we are hungry right now. Your food isn't something we neeeeeeed so badly that we'll be back at 11 am. It's something we were settling for bc we were close & your dining room looked busy enough that maybe the food wouldn't be bad. But I guess I'll never know.   I also didn't realize it was a Fox restaurant. I don't know what the hype is about w those but I've been to others & wasn't impressed. Now sold to the owner of RA? Lol. Please see my review of RA at Kierland to understand why that makes it even less likely that I'll ever know what Sauce is all about.

I have always been a huge fan of Famous Dave's but over the past couple years or so the quality seems to have declined significantly.   I always get naked St Louis ribs. They used to always be fresh, we'll seasoned with the rub, tender, and perfectly cooked. The last few times they have been burnt, chewy, dry, underseasoned and just not up to par with what I've always gotten & loved at Dave's. The only problem I used to have was EVERY SINGLE TIME if I ordered a side of ranch for my fries, it wouldn't come out w the meal and it would take a long time for someone to ask if everything was OK so I could request it again. But... That was minor and even became kind of a joke to me bc I just knew to expect it every time.   Last night we got take out from there for the first time. We usually dine in but my boyfriend picked it up & brought it over. I ordered my usual naked ribs and decided to go with sides of corn & broccoli. I felt like some nice fresh veggies would be good for me. The broccoli was completely inedible. It was dry and about 90% brown and wilty. I can't even believe they would send something like that out to a customer. If I didnt live so far away I certainly would've taken it back.   This was just another bad experience in a long line of them for me. Sad to say bc it used to be one of my FAVORITE places to eat,  but I'll be looking for a new BBQ joint.

Beware using technology like websites and email with this company!!!  I would say you should call, or maybe send a carrier pigeon or something that they can handle better than today's advanced technology.  Unfortunately I never got to find out how they were in an actual move because there were 2 different times when they supposedly didn't get what I submitted (both via the website and through email.)  I ended up moving my furniture in near record breaking Phoenix heat with the help of my parents who are in their 60's because they couldn't manage to set up a move for me.  My recommendation would be to make sure you either do things by phone to confirm that they have in fact received the information you have attempted to send, or to ask for a return email to verify receipt of your message. If you haven't heard back in a few hours, send another one and another until they respond.   The first issue was with the website. I filled out the "Inventory Form" and hit "Submit". It then kicked me back to the company's home page, so I figured that was what it does when the form is submitted. I waited and waited. Several days later I emailed Lynette asking what the status was. She said she never received it. Awesome. Evidently the website didn't work properly, but there was no indication of that to me. So...if you hit submit, just know that you should get some kind of notification. I did it again and it worked. Gave me sort of a summary of what I sent so I could keep a record. That's nice, but when it doesn't work, there's no way to know that it didn't work.  The second issue was through email. I was back and forth a couple times with Lynette after the first issue, so I knew she normally responded promptly. I emailed to confirm that I wanted to schedule the move as quoted and asked at the end what my next step would be. Didn't hear back for a couple days. So I emailed again to ask about the status and again...she says she never got it. Well...it was sent via "Reply" on my side to an email that she sent me. It's in my stream of emails and shows that it went through so I don't know what happened to it on her end.   What I DO know is that by the time I emailed to inquire, they had booked up the time that had been quoted to me and she said she didn't have any dates available until a week after I have to be out of my place. She did add that she could do July 4th weekend but it would be at a higher holiday rate. I have to be out by June 30th, so even at a higher rate, I couldn't even consider that.   You would think that maybe if you gave out a quote and hadn't heard back from the customer, before you book up the time slot you quoted for, you might call them and ask if they still needed it? That might be a great time to find out that you aren't getting emails that customers are sending for whatever reason.   But I guess that would take 2 minutes so I guess that's an absurd idea on my part. Yeah...just book the time to someone else. The person who filled out the entire inventory sheet and did all the steps up to the part where you confirm and request a credit card number...that 34 year old chick who lives alone probably doesn't really neeeeed a mover. Maybe she was just throwing the idea around and changed her mind...decided to move her own furniture by herself in 115 degree temperatures. That's probably it.   All those good reviews are nice. I wish I would've gotten to find out what a great job the movers could do, but due to more than one clerical error I didn't get to the actual moving phase with them.

BF & I went as an initial dinner/meeting place for a friend's birthday. The décor seemed ok...kind of cute log cabin, fish on the wall, kind of vibe. We sat at the end of the maybe 15 people we were joining. I wanted a water sooooo bad. We waited. And waited. Finally a waitress who everyone later named "Lisa Turtle" (y'know...from Saved By The Bell?) came over.   BF asked what stouts they had.  Lisa Turtle looked confused and said "Do you mean draught beers?"  BF: "Sure...what stouts do you have on draught?"  LT: "Do you mean like a kind of lager?" I stepped in and said, "You know...like Guinness? Guinness is a stout. Do you have any other beers like that? LT (looking relieved to understand-ish): Ohhhh...yeah...Guinness and Newcastle. I explained to my bf that Newcastle is not a stout...it's a brown ale. BF: What else do you have like that? LT offered Kiltlifter, Coors Light, Miller Light, and finally PBR.  I laughed as he ordered a Blue Moon. I ordered a water (which I wanted more than beer at that point) and a Guinness. When drinks came, no water. She brought it later and all was well.  Paying the tab was a little rough too, but LT finally got it done.   In the end, I wasn't impressed. Between the server and the douchy customers filling The Lodge, I don't believe I'll go back if I can help it.

Chili's is Chili's...I don't expect toooooooo much.  I've been to this location many times because it's close to home. However, this last visit cost me over $80 for 3 people, and was somehow STILL so bad that I may not go back.  We sat at a high top in the bar. It was pretty busy and we waited a long time for a server. We couldn't even touch the table bc it was still dirty so we grabbed a smelly rag from the table next to us and wiped the stuff off the table.  When the server came, she was ok. I'm a good tipper, so I ended up tipping her 20% which was like, $13 and some change. However, she was very busy and seemed like she had too many tables. She was one step behind all night. We had already paid our bill using the table machine and about 5-10 minutes later she asked if we needed anything else. We said no. She informed us that she could either bring us a bill or we could use the machine. Yep...did that a while ago. Thanks.  :)   My boyfriend and I split a ribeye steak meal and a rib meal. Each of these was around $17 I believe. TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT. I have never gotten anything besides "fast food" type foods at Chili's. And I never will again. For that amount I could eat a delicious juicy steak, cooked properly and with fresh sides at somewhere like Outback.  The steak was ordered medium and came out well done. Absolutely NO pink in the middle...none. The sides were bad...dry yellow broccoli, first garlic bread I've ever had that I didn't care to eat, cinnamon apples were squishy and way too sweet & goopy, old brown lime in my beer...  Worst part was after spending so much money and eating mediocre food, we both got sick. Yep...for $83, we got bad food AND diarrhea. Thanks Chili's!

I suppose for people who insist of spending a fortune to get their pets some super duper organic cleansing foo foo magic food, perhaps this is a good place. I, on the other hand, just popped in to check whether they carry the cat litter that I use. It's unscented and regular stores like Walmart and Target tend to run out of it constantly. I ordered some online from WM but while waiting for delivery I thought I'd see if I could grab a box at this store.   I normally pay $11.67 for a 25 lb box. At this store...28 lbs was...$28 and some change!!!   Listen...I understand that it's a specialty store blah blah...but this is the exact same product sold at Walmart for 47 cents per pound and here it's OVER A DOLLAR A POUND! For something that my cat is going to pee and poo in, a dollar a pound seems pretttttttty steep! Marking things up more than double what other stores sell it for can't be good for business.   I honestly don't understand why someone would go to this store unless they had money just burning holes in their pockets and needed somewhere to throw it away.  The customer service was...ehhh....the guy looked up when we walked in, said hi, and said bye when we walked out. I would hope that if I had paid $30 for some kitty pee pee sand he might have been more friendly. They must do SOMETHING that makes customers come back after getting ripped off like that, right??  PS: All you people spending a bazillion dollars on bullshit fancy food for your pets...they're ANIMALS. In the wild, they would be eating dead rodents, birds, etc... Dogs eat turds for crying out loud! I'm pretty sure they can eat like, regular pet food from a pet store or even the vet where it's MUCH cheaper than this joint. Will I go back? Uhhhh...no.

I had an issue that I wanted to bring to the attention of management, so I went on the website and wrote out my issue, went to send it, and no matter how I wrote the date it said "format invalid" so I could never send my comment.   In order to help other people who might go to this location (or any filiberto's I guess, you should know that there is this potential for mix up.  Here is what I experienced:  On the menu there is a heading of "Breakfast Burritos" and underneath the first 1 is called "Breakfast" followed by other types of burritos. When a person orders "a bacon breakfast burrito" they likely want 1 burrito from the "Breakfast Burrito" list...the "Bacon" one. Unfortunately, when there is also a burrito called "Breakfast", the employee thinks you're ordering two burritos...a breakfast one and a bacon one. The person doesn't realize until the order is complete and the total is double the listed price. But by then the employee is no longer on the line to correct the order. When the customer pulls up to the window and tries to explain, the employee can't understand why the person thinks they only ordered one burrito and he argues that they ordered a breakfast burrito and a bacon burrito.   I imagine the breakfast burrito ends up in the trash or eaten by employees and the company loses money. I'd suggest a different name for the "Breakfast" Breakfast Burrito. Maybe "Deluxe" or "Special"? I dunno, but a breakfast burrito called "Breakfast" is like a taco filling called "Taco". What kind of taco do you want? Beef? Chicken? Taco? And how do you order these? I need a taco taco or a breakfast breakfast burrito? And how do I order the type without saying the heading? Like "I want a machaca"...uhhh...a machaca what? Can't say "breakfast burrito" because then you've just ordered a breakfast breakfast burrito! See how confusing this is? It makes no sense. Not my loss if you keep wasting food because of this issue, but I wanted someone to know.

If you are a human being and thus may at some point after midnight need to pee or poop, don't eat here. The restaurant is open until 3 or 4 a.m. and is quite willing to take your money and serve you food and biiiiiiiiig giant sodas, but beware...their restroom closes at midnight.   I couldn't believe that as a customer, eating in, I was not allowed to use the restroom. Is that even legal??   I asked where customers were expected to use the restroom after eating and drinking at their establishment. The girl informed me that customers can go "next door to Fat Tuesday".  There are 2 MAJOR issues with that: 1 - you can't get into Fat Tuesday (a bar) if you aren't 21, so late night 20 year old sandwich eaters better have big ass bladders. 2 - the line to get into Fat Tuesday is sometimes about 20 people long, then once you get carded, get inside, and navigate through the crowd, the bathroom line for the ladies room is another 10-15 long. This means if you leave Jimmy Johns in the middle of eating to pee, you must be 21+ and you will be gone for 20 minutes to an hour to take a leak next door. You can then come back to your crusty sandwich and your annoyed friends who have been babysitting your food while you went pee pee partying over at Tuesdays. Screw that.  I'll tell you right now, if I were a guy, I seriously would've pissed on their floor under my table. But...as a girl, that could be messy for me. So...lucky for you Jimmy Johns...I was born without a penis. You win the prize of no pee on your floor, but you will never win my business EVER again.

I know it's a long review, but I think you'll enjoy it:  This was a couple years ago, but the issues aren't anything that would have changed so I decided to write a review anyway so other people might know what they're getting into.  Bf at the time bought the ride for my bday. He paid full price & thought it was a private ride for 2. We ended up in a tiny balloon basket with a pilot & 2 young Asian girls. Lucky for him, he loved Asian girls...a LOT. I am not Asian. You can understand why this was an issue for me. I did not enjoy my bf smashing against 2 hot young Asian chicks in a basket for my birthday. Not the company's fault, but would be nice if they had informed him that there would be other people on our romantic champagne ride. He kept apologizing to me for this but it didn't help.  To make it worse, the girls kept complaining about having gotten up early & talking about how they only went on the ride bc their dad paid 1/2 price for the ride via Groupon. Nothing like knowing my bf spend the equivalent of more than half his menial paycheck on a gift when the other people paid half price. Again, I know it's not the company's fault that some people don't look at Groupon, but it was just another negative on our trip.  The pilot was...ok. Ex bf mentioned that I fly airplanes and from that point on the balloon pilot was very condescending toward me.  Aside from the questionable company, the ride was strange as well. There is no real launch site. We got up at like 3:30 or 4 a.m. on my bday, drove to a location where we met the crew, then rode around in a van while they tried to figure out where we would launch. I don't know anything about hot air balloons, but driving around for a couple hours was pretty annoying. Guess it's how hot air ballooning goes? So...expect that.  Guess what you do after you wake up early and drive around with the crew and the hot Asian girls for a long time? You put together their hot air balloon! That's right...it's a very Tom Sawyer kind of trick where they're like "Hey, you're going to ACTUALLY help us built the balloon you're gonna fly in! It's so fun!" Uhhh...It's not fun. It's work. And the little Asian girls were Scottsdale snobs and refused to help so...for my bday, I got to assemble a hot air balloon at the crack of dawn while one Asian girl stood and watched rolling her eyes and complaining and the other slept in the van bc these 18 year old girls partied too hard the night before. Ugh...  The flight itself was fine. Uncomfortable for me bc of the weird situation being squished into a tiny basket with my boyfriend's Asian fantasy girls.  I have never been in a hot air balloon before or after this, but the "landing" was pretty much a crash. We hit tree tops on the way down. We were told to brace for impact, and the touchdown was very violent. Dust and rocks flying everywhere while the ground crew tried to catch the ropes and help us to stop without tipping over.  The "champagne breakfast" was the crew throwing out a basket of packaged muffins on a tailgate...think Otis Spunkmeyer style and some Sunny Delight with the option of champagne to mix with the Sunny D. Well...for the two of us who were over 21. Fantasy Asian chicks were like 18 so no ghetto Sunny D mimosas for them. They got in the van and slept while the crew packed up the balloon.  So...it wasn't what he thought, wasn't what I thought, and we paid double the price of the other customers. It kinda sucked. Except for the Asian girls...their daddy bought them the ride and they got to sleep a lot and get checked out by my bf the whole time, so I guess it was ok for them. Hopefully they'll write a nicer review.

Wow...interesting that there is already a review about the store opening late, because they suuuuure are prompt with CLOSING on time!   A friend asked me for a ride to this Goodwill (I call it the ghetto Goodwill), so I Googled it and found that they close at 9:00 pm. It was just after 8:30, so we drove on over and upon walking in, instead of a welcoming greeting, we were met with a girl saying "Hey, we close in 15 minutes". 1-we already knew that because we Googled it and there is a sign on the door 2-I understand giving people a warning that they don't have toooo much time to shop, but maybe they could start with "Welcome" or "Hello! How are you?...Ok great...well just so you know, we DO close in 15 minutes so ya better get shopping!" Anything friendly would be great. I feel like the greeting we got basically said "I hate being here, and want to get out as soon as possible, so I don't care if you have shopping to do, you aren't welcome here for longer than 15 minutes. Hurry up."   Funny that the last guy complained about them opening late. Opening late and making people feel unwelcome early...great business model.  I don't hit up Goodwill much myself, but my friend has some nostalgic fondness for it. In the future I'll probably convince him to go to a nicer one in a nicer area, hopefully with nicer employees.

I had this for the first time today. I got a large vanilla one and a small salted caramel one to go. I liked that they were torched right when I ordered them and they came in cute little containers with lids. (Some things from food trucks are difficult to take home.)    I was supposed to share them when I got home, but I maaaaaaay have eaten more like 2/3 of each one. They were AMAZING. Perfect creaminess & custardy texture. I have had creme brulee in the past that was too runny or too chunky. This was perfect. The flavor was awesome...the vanilla was as expected, but the salt in the caramel really made it interesting...in a good way.  I saw in previous reviews that they were too burnt...not so for me. Maybe they do less bruleeing (that could be a word). They were perfect...light golden crunchy top that tasted just torched enough and cracked with a spoon in a magical way. :)  As I mentioned on their Facebook page, I am actually glad this is a food truck and not a brick & mortar business because if I could go get one every single day I would. Then I'd go more and more. Then I'd be too fat to leave the house and hopefully they'd have delivery by then.  Love it! Can't wait to try some more flavors. :)

Ugh...if this location wasn't halfway between work and home and I didn't already have my prescription there with some discount coupon thing I've had on file for years, I wouldn't go here EVER.   Customer service in the pharmacy is HORRIBLE. I would swear the people working there are actually TRYING to get rid of customers. Maybe they have a contest going of how many customers each of them can get to leave every day. They're unfriendly, judgemental, tell you to do things differently than your doctor told you (which reeeeeeally pisses off my doctors), and act like you're bothering them to have to do their job. Really sir? Is it terribly inconvenient for you to put my prescription back onto automatic refill once a year?? I'm soooooo sorry to have to make you do that.   I have pricing issues about...once every 3 months (even though I get the SAME medication EVERY SINGLE MONTH for the last...I dunno...6+ years?)   The last time I picked up my prescription I had just brought in a new paper prescription from my doctor so I had to wait. My prescription is in a box, just one box, no pill counting or bottle filling. Just...grab a box and slap a label on it. There was NOBODY in the waiting area, and only about 3 customers in the entire store and I was told "It will be about 45 minutes because we have to help the other customers who are waiting before you." I turned around and looked at the waiting area...empty. Not ONE person. I put a picture of that on Facebook and got some good laughs while I waited for ALLLLLLLL those invisible people to get their meds before me. That's good for them, because if I had a disease that made ME invisible, I'd want my medication PRONTO!   There is a lady pharmacist there that is rude to me for no apparent reason, but I've seen her suddenly switch gears and be nice to others...usually very young thin attractive women. I think it's really strange. Maybe she's a lesbian? Maybe she discriminates based upon weight? I don't know, but she's a biiiiiiiitch to me EVERY SINGLE TIME.  I hate hate hate going to this location. I use the drive-thru when I can, but even THAT is uncomfortable most of the time.

No idea how service or quality is because when I called for a quote I got the message "The mailbox belonging to Tom is full and cannot accept new messages"  Unfortunately that earns a company one star in my book because having a way for customers to get a hold of you in order to do business is a pretty darn essential part of doing good business.   It's pretty impossible to get "real fast auto glass" when you can't even get a hold of the company to begin with. Lol.  Guess I'll call the next guy on the Yelp list.  :)  PS: Hey Tom, you should check your messages, dude! There are probably lots of customers looking for auto glass, man! If you forgot your password or something I bet the phone company can help you out. Just sayin...

Yep...wish there was a zero star option.   They lost my tax return and there's nothing I can do about it because I didn't pay extra for insurance because it wasn't of monetary value.    :(       Well it's valuable to ME because it has my personal and financial info, but that doesn't count as valuable to the postal service. Keep this in mind when you send something by mail that has that type of info on it.  I brought it in so I could physically see it be stamped and taken by the hands of a trusty postal worker. I physically DROVE TO THE POST OFFICE, STOOD IN LINE, DEALT WITH THE GROUCHY POSTAL PEOPLE, AND SAW IT GET STAMPED. I even came on a day when the parking lot was being paved or something and had to park down the street and walk. Figured it was still worth it so my taxes didn't get lost. And...they lost it.   How did I find out? Never got my return so I just called to inquire about it. Nope. They never received it. Awesome! Thanks USPS! And you wonder why people are going to email, texting, FedEx/UPS, e-filing (which I will likely pony up the money to do next year even though I don't believe I should have to pay MORE to file taxes than the taxes themselves and the stamp cost), etc...?  Because you're incompetent!!!   What an obsolete, useless piece of crap the postal service is.

I had the food once. My boyfriend brought it over. I thought it was pretty awful. Anything ending in "berto's" beats the hell out of this crap. As a matter of fact, ANY Mexican food including Taco Bell, Del Taco, etc... is 10 times better than this food.  I proooooobably wouldn't have worried about doing a review but I happened to see this story:  http://www.eater.com/2015/5/8/8575881/arizona-restaurant-insults-woman-on-receipt  Uhhhh...wow. Seriously? You should appreciate that this Mia woman actually pays money for your nasty slop. But I guess being a jerk to a customer is about right if you want to keep the customer service on par with the flavor.

I tried the delivery service for the first time. I have never been inside this JJ location, but it's closest to my home so I ordered. My boyfriend made the order, which included a conversation about onions with Alyssa (I believe) that went something like this:  BF: (thinking he's just being funny & she'll understand) Can you make the Country Club extra country? And by extra country, I mean add onions? Haha. Alyssa: So...you want extra onion? BF: Oh...does it already come with onion on it? Alyssa: No. BF: Ok...well then put onion. Alyssa: Extra onion? BF: It doesn't come with onion already? Alyssa: No. BF: Ok...then just add onion...regular...not extra.  The $20 delivery of 2 sandwiches, one bag of chips, one cookie, and one drink arrived very promptly. Alyssa was the one who delivered it. BF joked & asked if the sandwich was extra country. She said she didn't know...she didn't make it.  We start eating. I take about 2-3 bites and realize I haven't tasted any onion. I open my sandwich...absolutely no onion. Good thing they had that big convo about it, huh?  I considered calling back to get it fixed but all the employees at Jimmy Johns stores seem to be high school kids that I have absolutely no doubt would spit in my food for complaining, especially 15 minutes prior to closing. I decided to give "Feedback" on the Jimmy Johns website instead. Using my smart phone, I wrote a small description, filled out my address, phone number, etc, etc... and finally hit "Submit". I got a message back that said "Bummer...could not submit. Error 404" or some crap. Bummer? Really???   This PLACE is a bummer. And the fact that I will not be eating there anymore...that's a bummer for them. And my sharing a crappy experience here on Yelp...yep...another bummer for them!

I am really torn about this place because the server Jillian was fantastic, the name is catchy, the smell when you walk in is good, and the atmosphere was nice, but unfortunately the food wasn't enough to make us want to come back, especially for those prices.  We went there for my birthday (and they did get us some cupcakes to go on the house-1 chocolate salted caramel and 3 maple bacon which were...pretty, but weird tasting).   I got the 2 meat platter...ribs and pulled pork with sides of cole slaw and mac n cheese. I always get ribs naked and if I need sauce I usually find a decent spicy one at any BBQ joint. Their spicy sauces were not good. I felt like they tasted like tequila for some reason. I'm not sure if they were meant to, but it wasn't a good flavor for a bbq sauce. Also...other reviews have talked about the ribs falling off the bone. Uhhh...mine did not. As a matter of fact, I only ate a little meat off the top and when my boyfriend asked why I explained that I couldn't get the meat off of any of the other parts bc it was tough.   So...the pulled pork was ok...not much seasoning or smoke flavor but y'know...tasted like pork. There were a few gristly floppy fat things that I personally don't like, but maybe some people do.     The cole slaw was bad...like...not creamy and had some really strange flavor. I don't know what it was but it was gross and I didn't eat it. Normally I love cole slaw on my pulled pork, but this one would've ruined the pork.  The mac n cheese was good (as recommended by Jillian) but one good side isn't enough to make me come back.  My boyfriend got a steak. It was cooked perfectly as he ordered it, but it had no flavor. I would swear it wasn't seasoned AT ALL. Just a plain steak, flopped on a grill for some nice grill marks and served just like that. It was pretty bad. He doesn't eat veggies much but I tasted his green beans...they were very uhhh...fresh? Is that the nice way to say that something wasn't really cooked or seasoned? They were almost raw. I personally don't like green beans like that, but maybe some people do. If so...get them here. He had mashed potatoes too and they were pretty bland too. I guess if you serve a bland steak and bland green beans it's probably good to have bland potatoes with them so you don't accentuate the blandness of the other two items.  I almost forgot about appetizers! My dad ordered some redneck tacos for an appetizer. They were...ehhh...I wouldn't order them again. They were basically some pork and that funky tasting cole slaw on top of what basically tasted like a pancake. I had to cut it up to eat it with a fork, and didn't finish it bc it was so weird tasting.  We also shared some burnt ends which I normally love at BBQ places. They had strange flavor. Not sure if it was the meat or the sauce. I didn't care for them.   So like I said, the server was wonderful, but the food's just not enough to make it a place I'll return to.

First I'd like to say that I love reading the reviews where dudes say "there just aren't enough options for free weights for me" or "can't do heavy lifting here". Lol. I challenge them to use the maximum weight of any dumbbells or machines in this gym. If you need more than 75 lb dumbbells, you. are. buffffffffff. and you should probably just start bench pressing cars or something in order to get a good workout.  Ok, so I went with this gym because of the price...$29 to start, $10/mo then up to $15/mo after a year. No contract, just $25 to cxl. I have since seen lots of Groupons and deals for it and that kiiiiiiiiiiind of pisses me off every time I see it. The prices are SIGNIFICANTLY lower on those sites and I wish I would've been able to take advantage of that when I joined. You can also do the higher level membership for something like $20/mo and get guest privileges and half price on products like drinks that you can buy. For me...I'd rather bring my own water anyway and since I don't bring anyone with me I don't need the guest privileges. But...it's an option.  I like the cardio equipment, treadmills and arc trainers (kiiiiiind of like an elliptical but with more of a stair climber motion than elliptical has). They all have TVs built in with basic cable to distract you from your boring cardio. Haha. They also have iPod capability where you plug in using their plug (which charges your iPod while you use it) and you can listen to it through the machine using the buttons on the machine to skip, play, control volume, etc...  Because the equipment is new, I haven't experienced many broken machines like I have at older gyms. I have reported equipment that was malfunctioning in various ways and the employees are always prompt about testing them, putting "out of order" signs on them, and I have never seen something broken for more than a day or two.  They do have some equipment like medicine balls, kettle weights, and the big inflatable exercise balls. I don't personally use these things, but they ARE available and some people dig them.  There are no classes or pool, which I never used at other gyms anyway so I'm glad not to have to pay to not use them.  The employees are...cool for the most part. Most of them are friendly and willing to help you figure out a machine or exercise, spot you, or answer questions about workouts. There are a few rude ones, but I won't be too specific about those for fear that they will read this. Hey, I have to keep going here! :P   The gym is constantly being cleaned by the employees...vacuuming, wiping things down with spray, and checking and lubing up cables are things that seem to constantly be going on here. I like this a lot. There are also cleaning stations where you can grab your own spray and paper towels to wipe things down if  you wish. They offer hand sanitizer as well, which is nice at a place like a gym where everyone is touching everything.  As I read as a complaint in another post, they DO ask that you bring a towel. I too think this is a little annoying because I'm not one of those people who sweat all over the damn place, BUT...I get why it's a policy. There are some sweaty ass people at the gym and there's nothing worse than getting on a treadmill with nasty sweat droplets all over it or trying to sit on a weight bench that has someone's ass crack sweat on it. Gross. Just bring the towel people. There's no rule about the towel...it can be a little 2x2 square if you want to be a smart ass, or a beach towel if you like to maybe wear a towel cape while working out.  I've heard of a couple people getting double charged for their memberships, but staff is pretty quick to resolve these issues.  Overall, this is a good gym. It certainly offers enough for anyone to get a decent workout. I guess if you're a professional body builder who needs 1,000 lb machines and 200 lb dumbbells, it's not good enough, but for NORMAL people it's sufficient.

Got a coupon for a free charburger. I heard from a friend that the flavor "is similar to In-n-out but better". I'm not a HUGE In-n-out fan but it's OK so I tried the Habit. Of course you get the burger free but pay to add fries and a drink as expected. We then apparently made a mistake and asked for "cheese fries". (Which, btw, every restaurant I've ever been to can, and does, make.)   Cashier said "Uhhhh...I don't know if we can do that. Let me ask the manager." Manager comes out and asks what we want.  I explain again..."cheese fries...you know...fries with cheese melted on top."  She says no...that they don't have that.  ME: "Ok...do you have fries?"  MANAGER: "Yes."  ME: "Do you have cheese?"  MANAGER: "Yes."  ME: "Soooo...can you just put the cheese ON the fries?"  MANAGER: "No."  ME: "Is it about the cost? We can pay for the cheese separately as an extra piece of cheese for a burger and you can just put it on the fries. Would that work?"  MANAGER: "We can't put cheese on your fries."  ME: "Ok...can you just sell us a piece of cheese?" MANAGER: "Yes."  Food comes out, and sure enough in a separate cardboard fry container...a single slice of cheese which we promptly flipped over on top of the fries and VOILA! Cheese fries!  We made the amazing transformation right at the counter and showed them. I still don't understand why they couldn't just put it on the fries and skip the step and extra trash incurred by putting it in its own container, but whatever. Lol.  So...aside from the cheese fry incident the Habit was...eh. The taste wasn't anything special...probably rather go to In-n-out. The fries (even with cheese on them) weren't very good. The burger patty was very small. I wished I had gotten a double and I don't normally get doubles. The meat to bread/lettuce ratio was terrible. The prices weren't a great deal. I would say I probably wouldn't go back unless I got another free burger coupon and even then, because of the inflexibility of the cheese fry issue I believe I can safely say I won't go back at all. It's not the cheese specifically, it's the inability of the staff (especially the manager) to be helpful and figure out a way to do something so simple that would make a first time visitor want to come back.

Why not 5 stars? The location. I was a little creeped out by the location and the strange building next to it. There were some real sketchy lookin' dudes hanging out over there. Parking lot was kiiiinda small, but we found a spot.  Other than location, it's great! I was craving Indian Fry Bread and Googled restaurants...this seemed like our best bet. I'm so glad we chose it. The fry bread taco was faaaaaantastic (exactly what I was craving), and the posole was AMAZING! I didn't really like the chocolate butter dessert frybread; I'd probably go with honey & powdered sugar next time.   The decorations were very nice. The customer service was...decent. There was a nice Indian lady outside (despite the sweltering heat) making and selling jewelry. It was nice to look at & if that's your style she had some good prices.  I would definitely go back. However, I might bring a gun or pepper spray next time. Lol.

The food we actually GOT was okay.   We asked for recommendations on appetizers and the server recommended some kind of buffalo chicken eggrolls...said they were her favorite. We took her suggestion and ordered those and one other appetizer.   We then put in our order for food.   Appetizers never came.   Then the food came out...well...3 of the 4 meals came out.  Haha. The 4th was a few minutes later which was super awkward for the 3 of us who got our food.   Mine was a burger and the burger was good...cooked as ordered, etc... but I ordered sweet potato tots and got regular. When the 4th meal finally came out, we asked about the tots. They brought a bowl of sweet potato tots out. Thank goodness they left me the regular ones because the sweet ones were cold, soggy, and pretty gross.   The server never noticed that she didn't bring our appetizers. Of course, she didn't come back very often, so maybe that was why. Luckily they weren't on the bill, so we didn't have to argue about that. It took long enough to get the check and get it back that any additional delay would have been torture.    OH! And the parking was AWFUL. It was Wednesday so I can't even IMAGINE what it must be like on a weekend! We had to drive around the entire shopping center three times and finally ended up parking at another restaurant (BLD) and walk through some kind of smelly drainage area to get to the restaurant.   In the end, even though this place was close to my house, I don't think I'll go back unless someone else reeeeeeally wants to go.

PROS:  1-Aviation Theme - love it!!!  2-Stan our server was pretty cool  3-Interesting beers  4-Food was decent - rattler bites were awesome and the PB&J wings (recommended by Stan) were actually surprisingly good.  CONS:  1-HIDDEN CHARGES- Don't be surprised to be billed $0.50 for a side of mayonnaise for your burger (or bring some mayo packets with you in your purse! haha) & another $0.50 for carrots and celery with your wings. (I guess I always assumed servers were asking if we wanted carrots and celery because they didn't want to waste it if we weren't going to eat it. Nope...here they're upselling you to purchase garnish. Lol. I guess I never thought to ask if I would be charged. From now on every place that asks me will experience me asking if they are charging me for it. I'll munch a carrot or two for free but I'm not paying for that. Aaaaaand another $0.50 for each side of ranch. No free dips with the wings here, people!  PS: if you're a blue cheese fan, evidently that costs half as much so you can shell out only $0.25 for blue cheese. I would have made so many different decisions had I known these things. Could've saved a couple bucks!  2-Seems that the beers change a lot so you can never think "Oh, that place has _________ and I love that so I'm going back to get one!" because they might not have it. The good news is they'll let you sample some beers to find one you might like that they DO have in stock. :D  3-The menu is pretty small. Check it out before you go because it's very limited.   Bottom line...I'll probably hit this place up in the future for happy hour, daily specials, and appetizers.
