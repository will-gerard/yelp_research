I went with my daughter for lunch. I had passed by many times and figured I give them my business Instead of going to Da Vang where I usually go for Vietnamese food.   The lady who was hosting was very attentive she pulled out a chair for my daughter and came to help us right away. She answered all my questions and was friendly. Usually at these establishments staff is efficient but not  more than that.   The place is very clean and organized all the tables had the utensils neatly arranged. My order of spring rolls came out first with peanut sauce, in used to the vinegar dip w shredded carrots which is the more authentic dip.   The soup had rice noodles as they were out of egg noodles she said. I ordered a spicy pho with vegetables and the dumplings were stuffed with mushroom. I have never had pho with dumplings but this made it more filling and I loved the different tastes. The toppings to my pho were generous and the vegetables were fresh. I would definitely return to try more of their menu.

So went here for lunch. Looks like a sad deserted place. The small tables had their chairs out of place. If my acid was that empty you better believe I would have at least straightened up the place.   Anyway I ordered the Mexican  sandwich (torta) with carne asada. My friend ordered a red chile tamale combo w rice and beans. We waited a few minutes and it was delivered to out table. My torta looked huge and was wrapped in sandwich paper I was happy about that.  My plate included the torta w a side of rice abs beans. I opened the torta and it had lettuce, tomatoes, jalape√±os, and very little meat and was smeared with beans. It tasted ok so I squirted a large punt of salsa on it yo Mack the blandness. My sandwich (torta) was a high ratio of bread and very little meat.   My friend said her food was "lukewarm" but not hot. So this place is less than mediocre wily only recommend it if you are right there in the area and you really need to eat Mexican food.

Shop Devious is great for small business needs as well as marketing consulting. Shop Devious really took the time to show me the ropes on how to implement marketing into a business and how to use websites and cards to expand your product. I am not very proficient at computer applications but they did a wonderful job at educating me about the functions in a basic way that I can learn and put those skills into practice. Thanks to that and their willingness to help I have expanded my business and grown.

We went due to a friends birthday celebration.   The waiter was a young man he wasn't horrible but he wasn't good either.   They fee is several bowls of chips before we got our orders. Two of the people In my group said their food was not hot it wasn't even lukewarm. I tried a piece and it seemed as the prepared the dish and let it sit there for minute until the rest of the orders were done.   Ordered tortilla soup, liked great presentation wise but once I had of realized it was 98% tortillas that we're soggy and hardly any broth or soup in there.   It wasn't my choice to go here but the least this establishment could do is put effort into their service and efficiency and kitchen staff needs to be re educated or trained.

I meet my friend for weekday brunches here. As soon as I walk in we are seated right away by the host. Now carrying a baby carrier on my hand the host right away suggested a larger table and as soon as we were seated they brought out a sling to place the baby carrier in. I loved the fact that they had the initiative to do it I didn't have to ask them.   As far as service goes the staff is mostly young college age women who are very polite and prompt. I asked for my eggs cooked a certain way and they never mess up. My friend was on Whole 30 eating plan and they accommodated and adjusted her order.   The taste is good I've had a few different breakfast variations and everything was tasty never bland. I will have to try linch next time. Their pancakes are very unique as they have oatmeal or home made granola in them. They also have whole wheat pancakes and other options.   You will pay more than the typical franchise breakfast/diner but this place is worth it. Good service and clean, as well As good food.

This coffee is AMAZING and no I'm not exaggerating.   Get the Matador coffee it is a creamy latte with different flavors. Free Wifi and the pastries are not delicious.

I remember many years ago this location was a Taco Bell.   Well I was surprised a few years back when I saw that the closed TB building had when turned Into a donut shop. I first tried Bosa donuts as a coworker brought them in. They were so soft and pillowy.    Ever since then I had to try and try again. The inside of the store still has the TB color scheme tables and chairs but it is immaculate. I have to give Credit where credit is due and this location keeps everything so nice and neat. The OCD in me loved all the little milk containers in the fridge facing the same way.  Their donuts are not dry like DD nor are they crusty with glaze like KK, sorry. These donuts are soft and flavorful. You can distinguish the different flavors between them and they are big. A sign they are made in house out of real ingredients. I have also tried their coffee and Boba and those don't disappoint. I am happy to say that we have a local donut shop that has a superb product and it is not a corporate chain. I'm about taste, cleanliness, and quality. Not about paying for the decor.

I was really excited to try this place as I wanted a natural drink and lunch. I asked the guy at the counter what he would recommend drink wise since I wasn't very familiar with the drink menu and I said I will try his suggestion abs get it in a medium size, then for my food I also placed an order. I went to take a seat and saw how several to people who were treated very friendly like regulars come in order and leave. I waited so long and finally asked the guy who took my order if he knew anything about my drink order. Turns out her forgot and asked me for my drink order again. So he charged me but didn't put in the order. I was so hungry, thirsty but didn't say anything. He called me to get my drink. I drank it went back to my table and after waiting for 25 total got my food which I had to drink with water since the juice was drank way before that. I go to so any places and restaurants maybe I was expecting too much who knows. Bad customer service and so so product. I will not return no matter how modern or hipster this place is.

I really like this place for lunch as they are much quicker than traditional Vietnamese restaurants where you have to wait to be seated. I've been here three other times and the taste has been consistent with the Beef Pho, shrimp spring rolls, and the egg rolls. It's around work so this place is on my lunch rotation.

I gotta say I was skeptical to eat clean and healthy for lunch ad most places are bland and a bit disappointing.  I arrived with friends and wasn't sure what to order but the employee was very nice and offered some suggestions. They were not snobby they were very polite and patient as I browsed the menu.   I ordered the chicken kebabs with rice pilaf and a salad. The kebabs had large pieces of grilled chicken and were lightly seasoned. My fave part about the kebabs were the cherry tomatoes as they were roasted. The salad was fresh and crunchy. They have house dressing on every table. It's a light vinaigrette blend which added more juiciness to the meal. I think I paid a total of $12 for my plate which was so filling and a slice of their house chocolate cake to go.

I saw this new place in my area and we went to try it out since we felt like Asian food. It's small and has a cute little patio. Modern Asian flair on the decor. We were greeted and seated by the waitress who recommend the pork bone broth ramen to me and my friend had the bento box. The bento box was beautiful and had quite a bit if food I really liked that. The ramen was very tasty and amazing it was actual pork vibe broth. It did take a few minutes but I can see that they take their time putting the plates together that's the reason why.
