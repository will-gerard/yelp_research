I've been a customer for more than almost 10 years. This USED to be a place where personable employees met agreed upon dates at reasonable rates.   Today was the second in a row and final time they failed to execute on the promised date and time to have my cleaning ready.  The owner's response was to ask me for my ticket (I've been ticketless with them for years) as if that was the discussion to have.   There is too much competition in the area for this kind of sloppy service.

After 4 days with half of our AC system on strike and 3 fairly useless A/C service providers, Kilter Mechanical has solved our issue.  They are actually fixing it now.  Previous providers either could not diagnose or repair it.  Steve from Kilter Mechanical rocks!  He was professional, interested in understanding my problem, clear in his intentions, and most importantly, FIXED THE PROBLEM!  While other companies focused on what could not be done, Steve and Kilter focused on the solution.  I highly recommend Kilter for your AC repair needs

Mountainside Fitness at Desert Ridge is a great gym.  I've been a member at a few gyms here in town and have been going to MSF 5-6x per week since Feb 2016.  Let me tell you why MSF @ DR rocks:  1.  Membership - no BS.  No special deals or hidden fees.  Unlike some gyms that believe themselves to be upscale, everyone at MSF pays the same.   2.  Team - I met the GM, Ralph and told him that I have never walked in or out without a nice greeting from the desk crew.  The place is kept very clean and all the staff walk around with smiles.  This is rare and refreshing. 3. Equipment - State of the art stuff, almost always in good repair.  When something breaks, it's out of service for a day or 2, not weeks as in other places. 4.  Cleanliness - Yes!  Sure, when it's Saturday morning at 10AM, there's a rush and it tends to get a bit hectic to get towels out to the locker rooms, but every other time, the place looks AND SMELLS good.  I can't speak to any other Mountainsides, but the one at Desert Ridge rocks!
