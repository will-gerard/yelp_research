Went here tonight for dinner for AZ restaurant week, very good choice. The whole process takes about 2 hours but it is always nice to just relax during the meal. Both my boyfriend and I decided to get the cheddar cheese fondue and the bouillon fondue for the meats. Both very good. We also got the house margarita and a strawberry lemonade. Very good portion size for what you pay for and the slow pace of it makes so that you get full. We noticed that service was suuuuper slow though to get our main meal, but our server took the liberty of taking care of our drinks because of the wait. Great service! Hoping to be back soon to try the happy hour!

Always even a fan of this place. Took my boyfriend here last minute at 2:45 even though they close at 3.. Right away we order, me the regular breakfast and my boyfriend the lox plate. I have always remembered they have fast service, and they lived up to my expectation once again. Everything was perfect and so fresh. Must come back again soon. I forgot how good it was!   I also love the ambience. Very clean and has a good Scottsdale feel. I remember a few years ago when they revamped the place, and it's looking better than ever.

I usually love this place. It's been a great little spot of good dessert after a meal up in old town. But after doing much research and reading the other reviews, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. The fact that multiple people have said they have encountered cockroaches at this establishment, no way Jose for me.

Went here on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy! Only downside is that they got rid of their outdoor seating.. Which left us to sit inside of the freezing icebox that is the seating area. Our ice cream was delicious though! I will be back very soon!!! The ice cream cakes are delicious and my go to for birthdays!

Such great food every single time. Always a good mix of company in there, and so authentic. The first and best Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to

I really enjoyed the older ambience at this place. Kind of an 80s old diner feel, but very clean and not dingy like some other diners of this sort. Got the Jims special with home fries... Surprisingly good as well! There are many other good looking things on the menu, but I definitely have to come back again soon to try! It's a great distance away from my boyfriends house to walk, see you again soon coney!

Such a great place with great ambiance... the food was amazing. My boyfriend and I came here for our Valentine's brunch and everything was perfect. The service was a tad slow, but everything else knocked it out of the park! Be warned, the Bloody Mary is spiccccyyy! But good spicy :) Will be here again very soon, definitely waiting for it to be a little warmer at night to try and dinner menu, which looks awesome!

My grandparents are locals at this spot. I always come here when I'm in town! Last night I had the lemon pepper chicken and let me tell you, it was very delicious! I really like how there is a different section for smokers and non smokers, and the ambiance is also very inviting. They have live music and that really gives it that old school feel.

I'm always a fan of Yard house, great food and great service. Our server Matt was great and very attentive. We started off with beers; me with the Four Peaks Peach (always great) and my boyfriends tried two hefes. Although he did not like that, Matt was able to quickly change the order to exactly with my bf wanted. We got the spicy tuna roll (substituted with the ahi poke, as recommended by Matt) and the chicken nachos (amaaaazing & so much leftover). Great decisions by us! Also, Matt saw that it was our anniversary and brought us a complimentary dessert (the chocolate cake with ice cream) which was a great way to end the night. The food was amazing, but still can't beat the happy hour prices, which will probably lead us to come back on a weekday instead of a Sunday night. Great food, great service! Will be back!

A great place for amazing food! Right when we walked in, the place was filled with people and a great view of the kitchen. I knew right away that it was going to be tasty with how many people were seated instead and even at the bar eating their dinner.  To start, we started off with the mozzarella, tomato and basil plate. So fresh and all the ingredients just melted in my mouth. I got the chicken and my boyfriend got the steak. Absolutely loved every bite of it. The service was a little slow towards the end and it took us a while to get ahold of our server, but more talking time for us.

Great service and great pizza! Came here with my uncle and mom for a late dinner and it was pretty good! Sat at the bar and the bartender Jill was very personable and took of everything that we needed. If I were ever back in the area, I would definitely come back here again!

By far my favorite hotel in all of Vegas. Being a local, I have seen them all, and this place is perfect for the younger 20-30 crowd. Located right in the middle of the strip, it is so close to so much good nightlife and food places as well. Their ambiance is absolutely beautiful and the staff will tend to your every need. The wrap around suites are breath taking and it really helps if you have a big party to get that suite. I will stay here time after time!

Very very disappointed. It was movie night at my neighbors place and we decided on pizza. My friends had told me that this was the best place to get pizza so how to give it a try. First, the pizza took more than hour to get to us. We were pretty starving by that point. Second, the pizza was cold when we got the box... What a miserable fail. I just ate it because I was so hungry, but after this experience, I'll probably go somewhere else as my first call for delivery pizza.

Every time I come back into town, I absolutely have to stop here. My go to is the taco salad. I would recommend that most definitely. I used to go to the Sahara one, but this one is always closer when I visit now. The service is always great and I wish I was more hungry to get a dessert, but I always love the chocolate chip cookies, no matter what the calorie count is... Love that it's on the strip. Go if you can, it's a great lunch spot in between shopping

My uncle picked this up to go for my mom and i. We really enjoyed the sashimi plate of 20 pieces. All of the pieces were very think and very fresh. The fish practically just melted in my mouth. The 20 pieces were not enough for all three of us, so we ended up going back and getting two rolls, Ohjah roll and the Las Vegas roll. I would definitely say stick with the sashimi. I will come back when I'm back in town most definitely

A typical Starbucks but STAY AWAY from all Starbucks on campus. For some reason they have the WORST service..

Arizona Donut Co has to be the best donuts in all of Arizona!!! When I am craving a donut (which is often) this is the only place that I will go. Their donuts are only 89 cents each, but it is a downfall that you have to charge at least $3 on a card. The only place to go if you have a sweet tooth! I love the cinnamon roll & the pink sprinkled donut the best. So good!

Thoroughly enjoyed my night here tonight! Right when we walked in it was super packed. We couldn't find our own seat in the bar area so moved on to the dining area for 8 people. The zipparita is actually very good for the happy hour at only $3. When it says there's a limit on the menu, I knew I would get my money's worth of alcohol.  When we ordered food, we got the mild buffalo wings and the chips and guac.... Not a bad wait for both of the items with how busy it was. The buffalo wings in mild were way too bland for me so we had to get a side of medium sauce for the extra kick. For the chips and guac, both very good but had to a season the guac with much more salt and pepper. For the rest of the night it was just more drinks.  For it being March Madness, I would love to be back here again during this week. A great place to watch games as TVs are absolutely everywhere. Keep up the nice work as a new sports bar on Mill and people will continue to come in! Be back soon!

I absolutely love it here. The ambiance, openness of the restaurant and the service are all great; I wouldn't expect anything less than fox. Been here two times now within the week and both times have made me want to come more. The first time I had the raw vegetable salad with chicken and the next, the Mediterranean salad. Both were very very good! I'm on a mission to try them all.  The drink choices are also very good as well. No matter what you choose, they all will quench your thirst. I'll be back very soon !!!!
