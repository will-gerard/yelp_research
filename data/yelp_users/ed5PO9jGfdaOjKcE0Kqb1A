We used to really like this place and have taken at least two dozen people here, some of which are regular diners now. That was then..  My husband tried to use a coupon from Dine4az.com and the owner refused to take it, saying it was a fake coupon. First of all, Dine4az.com is a site that restaurants sign up to promote their restaurants. Not just anyone can create a fake coupon and post on that site. The owner completely embarrassed my husband in front of a very large group of friends tonight and made my husband pay for the cheese crisp on the coupon.   We will never be back!

The ladies at Desert Vista Dental West are professional, knowledgeable and fun. They are punctual, give full attention to patients in the chair, explain procedures and are thorough. The office is clean and up to date. From the initial call to schedule my appointments, the friendly greeting when I walk in, the care in the back and checking out afterward, I've had nothing but pleasant experiences 'at the dentist'! I have referred family and friends to this office and will continue to do so. Thanks, ladies!

4/17/16: While waiting for our food, another patron noticed a MOUSE in the kitchen. We all asked for refunds, and the employees said they were calling an exterminator and closing down for the day. We went across the parking lot to another restaurant and watched cars being served in the drive thru, and as new cars pulled up to dine in, they were not turned away. Ew!!!

I have spent a pretty penny in this store, but not because they are expensive! They really need to add "& Home Decor" to their name because they have much more than hobby supplies. Half of my home decor has been bought at Hobby Lobby. No joke.  Pros:  Christian based Nice music playing in store 40% off coupon on webpage Everything goes on sale. If you want something and it's not 50% off, wait 1-2 weeks and go back. Seriously. Wide variety of products If you're in the market for Halloween decor/craft supplies in June, they have it and probably at 50% off. Thanksgiving decor is already 50% off in September. You can buy your Christmas tree and decor in July. The pro of this is that you can buy it at 50%-75% off in November & December.    Cons:  Closed on Sundays, but it's so their employees can go to worship services. Close at 8:00 pm No bar codes. The cashier manually enters prices and sale prices. Watch carefully, especially if you get a lazy teenager as a cashier.

We've been 3 times in the last 8 days! It's that good.  The first time we went was a Saturday around 4:00pm. The place was packed and we almost didn't get a seat before our food was ready. We were instantly hooked on their food. My husband orders their BBQ Burger and I love the Classic Smashburger. The produce used is high quality and actually ripe. No yellow tomatoes here! The pictures you see of the burgers are a very good representation, not just some prop. Their Smash Fries, regular fries and Veggie Frites are yummy.   The cashiers have been a little off each time we've been there, but probably because they are crazy busy. The servers have been super great, always accommodating and friendly. They also keep the place very clean.  As I stated before, the place needs more seating! Last night, we invited about 25 friends with us. (Not kidding!) The place was crowded inside, so we were trying to figure out seating arrangements on the patio. The manager came out to check on us & seemed a little frustrated by our large group, rather than grateful for the business.   My husband tried to order a frosty mug root beer float, but they had run out of their IBC Root Beer. They also told him they ran out of meat earlier in the week because they have been super busy.   I think once they get all the small kinks worked out, it will be even better.

Great atmosphere, friendly staff, reasonable pricing, pretty good food. There is a wide variety on the menu. The burgers taste like what I make at home, but saltier. I think their secret (as is mine) is Montreal Steak Seasoning in the patty. I could be wrong, but it tastes like mine, but much saltier. They need a diaper changing station in the bathroom - at least they have highchairs! The mac n cheese is yummy, the coleslaw is bland, the fries are pretty good. Ask for the dipping sauce to add an extra bite.  (As far as burgers go, I prefer Smashburger.)

My husband & I took our kids here last Sunday, with another couple. We had a Groupon Now, which was why we decided to try it.   Sundays, they have a delicious brunch buffet that includes champagne or Horchata. They have a lady making fresh tortillas (that are just okay) and an omelet station. The buffet had two varieties of soup, waffles, churros, mexican pudding, fresh fruit, beans, rice, flavorful meat, several desserts and all the juice and Horchata one could want. Kids 3 and under eat at the buffet for free, which is a big plus in our book!  We must have had the same waiter as Lucky T., because we had to ask the manager for menus, what the price of the buffet was, etc, as the waiter would just nod and walk away. He'd come back empty handed and with a puzzled look on his face.  The mariachi band was great to listen to and very friendly. They played a couple of songs at our table, and played a special chicken song for the kids.   We will probably go again on a Sunday.

We drove 45 minutes from the West Valley to buy "Dill Pickle Popcorn" from Bubba Corn. I fell in love with that stuff at the Yelp Science Center event. It was 4th of July weekend and so stinking hot outside. I'm not sure if the market is usually as tiny, or if vendors were out of town... or hiding indoors somewhere.  We bought yellow tomatoes and sweet corn that were amazing! I'd eat the tomatoes like apples, but with a dash of salt. (Yum! Now I'm craving them.)  I can't wait to go again once it cools down, so it will be more enjoyable.

We had a party of 17, of which 8 were children. The chopped salad and wood fired pizza were delish! The waiter was beyond GREAT with the kids, and suggested a kids table so the adults could chat. With the "Kids Eat Free" on Sundays, I can see this becoming a regular after church outing for our group. Only suggestion is a changing table - if possible in the tiny bathroom. We are regulars at the Arrowhead location.

Great food, but kinda steep on pricing. ($1/inch on subs.) Got 1 wrap and 2 regular sized subs for $22!

Beat selection of soup, salads and sandwiches. Even the pickiest eater can find something here! Love that we can sample the soups before ordering. Best price & value for combinations vs competition. The chocolate strawberry is a delicious touch, and healthier than a cookie.

WOW! The reviews were not wrong. The $2 Teriyaki Chicken Bowl is HUGE! It's plenty to feed two kids. We ordered one for each of our kids, and will have leftovers for 1-2 more meals. My husband and I shared a Large Chicken Fried Rice and had more than enough for him to take for lunch the next day. Friendly owners.
