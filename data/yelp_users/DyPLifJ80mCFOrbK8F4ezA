Excellent little restaurant! The food is of great quality. The Thai tea and the mocktails are delicious. The presentation of the food itself is stunning.   We went around 3:45 in the afternoon on a Tuesday and the place was empty. The quiet atmosphere and the decor were a plus. The decorations add a nice touch of classic Thai culture. I definitely recommend this place. I know I'll be returning!

The pizza is not the problem here, but the service is. I walked into the store and was not greeted. Instead the employees continue chatting about their conversations. When I was about to ask a question, the cashier walked away from the register to make another joke with a fellow employee.   The entire store seems to be run by immature teenagers. The lobby area was not particularly clean either, yet there were more than enough employees there that could maintain it. I gave this review two starts until I witnessed workers eating in the kitchen which is a health code violation. I came in to buy pizza for my employees but I don't think I will be returning to this location ever again.

My man Edgar! He's finally opened his own place where he can focus on his clients his way. There are few people that offer the quality and service that Edgar does. He's passionate about his work and puts 110% into each cut, trim, and style.  The Manner is the ideal place for your hair and beard needs. There are a variety of options available that you can book directly through Yelp. I recommend you book well ahead of time, as this man gets booked quickly! Edgar is a genuine gentleman who will treat you like family.
