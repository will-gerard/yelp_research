This is one of my favorite places to eat. I think that their uni is always the freshest and creamiest compared to other competitors. Only place so far that gets good quality monk fish liver. Very consistent in good quality. There is always a wall of the their fresh catch of the day where you have the opportunity to try something you usually would not. They are priced very fair.   The restaurant has a very authentic feel to it all well. The staff is very friendly. The restaurant is small though and fills up fast.

food here is so good. Just make sure you are really hungry. The plates are hearty and heavy. Love that the door is sort of hidden. A more intimate and bar feel. If you want bigger space go down the street to Richardson's where the menu is the same.   Shrimp appetizer is basically like a whole meal. I thought it was just going to be 4 pieces but it was served on top of a tortilla that was covered pizza style in different types of beans, cheese, and salsa.  The rib appetizer is spicy good.

Went on my birthday last Wednesday for the first time and it was surprisingly busy for a Wednesday. Ordered the spicy tuna roll, quail egg shooter, hamachi Kama, and some squid nigiri. The spicy tuna was good giving a little extra per piece after the sushi was already cut. Quail egg shooter was delicious. Hamachi Kama was disappointing because it was over cooked and burned at some parts leaving certain parts of the yellowtail collar to be dry and not as mouth melting as it should be. The squid nigiri was good but not the best. I was disappointed they gave me a specials sheet but was out of some things I wanted to try. Especially the monk fish liver. The service was very quick and friendly. I would definitely come back and eat here again to try other things on the menu

Ordered the fried tofu which was good and crispy, did not like the peanut sauce that accompanied the tofu. Whoever dropped my food off was so quick to leave I seriously couldn't tell who did it since they were all wearing black.  Ordered the pho with steak and meatballs for my entree. Pho came out not even hot- mildly warm. It was very bland. I rarely send food back but it was just terrible. When I told the server it wasn't hot and I didn't really care for it she took it away. She came back immediately and dropped  my check off. I was planning on ordering the hot and sour soup instead but I was really given no option. It was a little disappointing. Most likely never coming back to this restaurant.  I felt bad, all the staff looked irritated that evening. I felt like a burden being a patron at the restaurant.    *update: the owner reached out and was very understanding and apologetic. Even offered a refund. I appreciate the concern and just may give it another try

Terrible sushi. Couldn't finish it at all. Ordered quail egg, sweet shrimp, spicy tuna roll and a salmon skin hand roll. When the chef gave my server the shrimp heads to deep fried he went and showed people and his co worker how it looked and how weird it was before bringing to the back. When my order came out I was given tamago instead of quail egg and told him I thought it was wrong. The server said that he asked the chef and he said it was quail egg. I once again said it wasn't quail egg and they corrected it for me. The decor was dark and depressing. I will never go back again

My favorite Thai food that I've eaten in the area so far. Some competitors around botch simple dishes. I get the bento for lunch but I'm always too full to finish the entire thing. You get an appetizer, salad or soup, and a choice of three meals.  Tom yum soup is great. Sweet, sour and hot.  Also I love the flavor of the green curry catfish.   My favorite thing about this restaurant is when you ask for hot sauces you get many options: you get paste, chili powder, pickled jalape√±os and Thai Chili's in fish sauce. All very good.   Happy hour is all week. I need to come back for dinner service sometime!

My favorite place to go. Foot massages = full head to feet massage but primarily focus on your feet. Yoga massage= focuses on upper body and lots of stretching. Done both and love them both.   I only do the yoga massage when I feel I really really need it cause it cost more.   They open late so you can even make an appointment to afterwork.

Scott did a great job mounting our TVs! He even went to ace to make sure we had extra sturdy rods cause he didn't want to risk it with the ones we had. For our bedroom, without even asking he was able create a new outlet behind the TV so that our wires wouldn't show. He also provided us with Velcro so we could hide our direct tv box behind it.   Very nice man. He was on time to the appointment as well. Would definitely use their services again

A little diamond in the rough. I would never have come in here if it werent for its yelp reviews. The place was located in a strip mall and its sign only said sushi until you got to the front door did you see "sushi catcher"  The decor is average for your standard hole in the wall. But food was great. There was a complimentary crab and cucumber salad. I ordered the chirashi bowl for lunch which was a huge portion. The fish was surprisingly fresh. The rice was seasoned as well.   I've been trying out lots of sushi places in the glendale area and I have not wanted to go back to any sushi restaurant but i will definitely return to this one!

My boyfriend and I love going to eat here. Hidden restaurant in the back of a plaza behind the dominos. The food really taste authentic. Prices are so cheap. Two big bowls of soup, an appetizer,2 drinks, and Togo pre made food for under 30.   Banh xeo as an appetizer - crispy Vietnamese crepe. I got the bun bo hue and my boyfriend got the pho Tai nam. Both great and flavorful.  Took the mam trung? Togo (not sure if I spelt it right) which is a steamed eggloaf. Very hard to find, I was so happy they had it!   We will always come back!

best dish on the menu isnt even a dish! its an addition to a dish that you can also get on the side. i love the garlic noodles and always add the grandmas sauce to it  (which is spicy and addicting)!! my favorite spring roll is the dragon lady spring roll which has shrimp tempura and jalapenos in it. Food is always consistent. the owners are always in the restaurant and super friendly.   Poke spot for Pokemon players!

Place is amazing!!   Small restaurant in the center near subway and frys. The decor was very fun and cute.   We came in for brunch. I got the florentine Benedict and added avocados and my boyfriend got the Italian sand which. Both meals were accompanied by a side salad. My boyfriend said after his first bite "so simple yet soooo good". We would definitely come back again for dinner because we have to try the French onion soup next !   Chai latte lacked a little flavor but not a huge deal. They gave me a huge mug.  They have a bunch of macaroons -- we got oreo, blueberry, chocolate on the way out

Food was just ok. The eggplant I found really good. But when asking questions about the menu, the server didnt know how to help at all. She barely spoke english and was confused when asking if we could get beef instead of chicken with ramen. She then suggested beef noodles. It didnt have ramen though, we didnt know that. My friend didnt really like its texture that much.   We ordered a soju alcoholic drink. It was good but when we ordered another one, the server came back 15 minutes later and said that the manager made the last drink, she didnt know how to make it and she wasnt sure if the manager was coming back.   I did like the hot pot, i thought it was spicy and adding extra toppings werent expensive  We ordreed a side of beef tongue which we were pretty sure it had a bad smell.  Although I thought the hot pot was good, I probably will be very hesitant to come back because of all the other entrees and the restaurant's service.

Uber Fresh and Delish!  I always sit at the bar and talk to the owner. If the fish isnt fresh, they dont have it. Uni is from Santa Barbara. They get toro in usually too. They are moving locations in the same plaza.  M-Th they have happy hour all day

My boyfriend is from Wheaton, which is the next town over from warrenville, il (the original two brothers) so when this place opened he was so excited. Finally, after months we finally made our way over to the new brewery in old town Scottsdale. Big open floor plan, parking can be a little annoying though because they don't have their own parking lot. We parked across the street.   We ordered a ceasar salad, Cuban sandwich, truffle fries and sonoran cole slaw. Everything tasted great the Cuban came out nice and toasty. Fries were hand cut but crisp. I drank the Scottsdale shandy made with their EPA while my boyfriend enjoyed the domain dupage draft.  We will definitely come back. We'll make sure to come earlier next time because happy hour is only from 3-6 so we barely missed it

Great new restaurant with ample outdoor space. I got pasta and tuna which was really good. Food is a generous portion as well. The girl across the bar was raving about this Thai coconut soup so that will be next on the list.   Good location near downtown / central Phoenix but has plenty of parking . Park off flower.   If you're a wine connoisseur then this is your place. There are little icons next to the each wine to explain the flavor.   It was pretty busy so thumbs up to the curly brunette food runner working his butt off and running around

It's so nice to have a part of Tucson in Phoenix. This place is a Tucson staple. We drove 30 minutes to get here. I don't know if it's just nostalgia but I still felt tucson was better but nonetheless it's still delicious. They own the corner and they have a large room that you can se e through to  view how they are making their food from scratch.  Always get the Sonoran dogs. That's the best and main attraction. Bacon wrapped dog with beans, mustard, avocado paste, tomatoes, onions, sour cream. It's so amazing. Followed with a real sugar Coke in the glass.

Beautiful modern decor! Located near the starbucks drive thru and smoothie king. They have a large selection of gel colors and my polish didnt chip after 2 weeks so that is a great sign. Will definitely return
