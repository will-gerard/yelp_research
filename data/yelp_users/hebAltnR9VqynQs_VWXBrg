We have been to this location a few times with varying levels of success.  None have ever been great. We actually hadn't been there for about a year when we decided to give it another shot a few nights ago. We walked in about 8:30pm and it wasn't busy. Stood around for at least 5 minutes before we were seated. Once seated we waited 8 to 10 minutes for our waitress to even come over. We placed our order and when the waitress brought our food she just set it down and quickly walked away. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal except one of our meals was the total wrong thing. She was no where to be seen for several minutes. In the time we were waiting I took a bite of my steak and spit it back out. It tasted bad. It was gray looking inside and had a funny taste. So the waitress finally comes back and we tell her one of the orders was wrong and grabs a menu and procedes to debate what we ordered. She just wrote down the wrong thing. We ended up not eating. Our meal was ruined. This is the worst Applebee's ever.

Very reasonable and very fast. I run a shoe store and have taken some customer repairs to them. Always friendly!

So we have been here since September 2013.  When we decided to move here there were several reasons that made us decide to make the move.  First, we looked at the model apartment for the newly renovated apartments and it was very nice.  Everything was top of the line, it looked fantastic.  We toured the apartment twice.  Both times we were told the apartments get "all new appliances".  We were told our apartment would have new windows.  We specifically asked if there would be a ceiling fan in the bedroom, they told us yes there would be one.  The apartments will be all repainted with new fixtures, new counter tops etc.  We were very excited about moving in to a nice apartment.  We put down our deposit and waited for move in day.   Move in day came and we go to the office at 9am to pay the rest we needed to pay and get our keys.  We had movers waiting on us.  We get there and we are told we have to have a money or cashiers check.  This was news to us because no one ever told us that or explained that at any time.  She told us it was in the packet they gave us earlier.  Maybe it was our fault because we missed that.  I never saw it in the packet and they took our personal checks when we applied for the apartments.  It just didn't make much sense.  This made us a little upset because we had movers waiting on us.  We had to run to the bank to get a cashiers check and come back.  Once we had that handled and brought it back we were advised we had to have something printed from the insurance company about our renters insurance.  Once again, no one told us this.  Luckily they let us get the keys and I had the insurance company fax something later in the day.  It was an annoyance at the lack of detail from the leasing office.  Finally we go to look at our new place.  We walked in to find a mess.  I have never been so upset upon moving into an apartment in the 22 years I have been renting.    We walked into the apartment to find so many things wrong.  Let me say this, these are far from luxury remodels.  Yes, I am pleased with the kitchen appliances.  They work well and they look very nice.  One thing that is a bit disappointing for this apartment is there is no ice maker in the brand new refrigerator.  This seems like something that would be there for a nice apartment.   Upon inspection of the counter tops there are big bubbles around the seems of the counter.  They do not put new counter tops in.  It is a spray coating on the old counters and it is done very poorly.  It looks bad.  Next, the paint is done horribly through out the apartment.  It was peeling off the wall around the light switches.  The painting on the cabinets was peeled off at the bottoms by the floors in the kitchen and in both bathrooms.  Now let's get the bathrooms.  The grout in the tubs (both of them) was yellow and parts of it missing.  They put brand new fixtures in  but left the old nasty yellow grout.  They obviously didn't even make an attempt to clean it.  Once of the brand new shower curtain rods was completely bent.  In the bedroom no ceiling fan.  This was the one thing we specifically asked about.   When we asked about this they told us they never said there would be one in there and if we wanted one we could buy it and they would put it in for $25.  Seriously?  This really just pissed me off.  We were able to get them to not charge us the $25 and just to save myself the aggravation I went to Home Depot and bought one.   Now there are other things that were not right.  No screen on the sliding door.  They did fix that finally.  No new windows.  The window are so old, there is no insulation, they leak air and you can hear everything outside.  It is terrible.  All screens on the windows that open are full of holes.  We are still waiting for these to get fixed.  We don't open the windows because bugs will get in.  The holes are that big, not to mention they are horribly dirty.  The last item at move in that was a problem was the washer and dryer.  In the model they have a nice brand new washer and dryer, they tell you "all new appliances".  We took two tours and were told that on both tours.  We look in the laundry closet and we find a kind of new washer and a dryer that is so old it is not white anymore, it is yellow.  We contacted the office and they said they only put new kitchen appliances.  That is totally not they way the advertise it and not what they tell you.  We feel like we were lied to.  The dryer overheated the first time we used it and they ended up getting us a "newer one".  Also, the first time we went to use the washer it went out on us and we had to go to the laundromat to do our laundry.  They finally brought us a washer. It was "newish". Other problems: Passive manager, LOUD every monday lawn service, trash people are loud.  Stuff going on every day that makes this place horribly loud.  No peace and quite.  Overpriced for the level they provide.

I am giving my update after living here a year.  If I could give a 2 1/2 star I would.  Let's start with the positive.  We hardly ever hear our neighbors on the top or bottom of us.  The space between floors is insulated well.  It is a great location.  Easy to get places.  They have done a few cosmetic upgrades to the grounds.  The staff in the office has improved and really seems to make an effort.  The maintanece staff fixes things very fast when there is a problem.   Ok, now lets get to the things that are not so great.  We got our lease renewal and they want to raise our rent nearly $100 more a month!  (We did talk to them and get that lowered but it is still really expensive).  The place is still very loud around the apartments.  DO NOT GET AN APARTMENT FACING ANY OF THE STREETS! The windows are like paper and leak air like crazy.  Super loud.  Security is still a joke.  Do not live here if you think the illusion of the gate makes this a secure apartment complex.  I have never had a break in but people are consistantly sneaking in the gate that do not live here.  We still have not had any of the stuff on our move in list (from a year ago) fixed.  They promised us if we resign our lease they will get fixed.   We are unfortunately in no position to move right now so we are stuck signing another lease and paying the crazy increase.  This will be our last year if things don't get better.  Or we will move out before our lease is up.

Upon moving to Arizona I had been using Frist Credit Union to do my banking because they offer shared banking with my credit union in Nebraska.  The process was easy to just go in and deposit money into my Nebraska account.  After awhile I decided I should open an account here in Arizona.  I went in and opened my account and everything was good for a short time.  I would bring in my checks and be able to have my funds available right away.  One Friday I brought my paycheck in and they said they had to verify my employment in order to put the check in my account.  Weird since they did that the first day I opened my account and weird since they had already cashed a couple of my paychecks.  Also, the company I work for is a huge company and has been in business since 1974.  So they called my work, verified my employment, deposited the check and the funds were available.  Next payday I go in and the same thing happens, they say they have to verify my employment...I am a little over it at this point.  They call and do their thing and deposit the check.  Next payday, same thing.  At this point I am getting upset because there is no reason to keep having to verify my employment.  I have worked there for 7 years!  I ask about this and tell them I am getting upset by this and the acted as though they really didn't care.  I needed my money so she calls, verifys my employment and comes back tells me there will  be a 10 day hold on my check. Seriously???  They have been cashing my checks since day 1 with no problems.  I put up a fuss and she tells me she will cut it down to a 4 day hold.  What???  So she can just make her own rules???  I told her to forget it and deposit it in my shared account in Nebraska.  She got really rude with me and told me they would put a hold on it also.  I looked her in the eye and told her to do it and I assured her they would never put a hold on any deposit in my account.    She deposited the money and guess what??? The money was immediatly available.  I told her to close my account because I was so pissed off.  She then told me I would be charged $35 to close it!!!  What???  She said it was stated in the paperwork I got when I opened my account... I looked through it all and I have nothing that states this.  To sum this up, DO NOT GIVE THIS CREDIT UNION YOUR MONEY!  They seem to have forgotten that they need our money, we don't need them.  There are a lot of  banks out there that are happy to have your money.

We ate here for the first time the other night.  We were at a friends house up the street and decided to go have some dinner.  It was pretty late and close to closing time.  When we walked in we were greeted by the staff who was very friendly.  I really enjoyed having the tea at our table.  When our food arrived I was quite suprised.  It was great!  Decent portions and very deliscious.  I live in central Phoenix but I will make the drive to eat here again.  It was a little pricey but the quailty of the food was worth it.  Yummy!

The other day I was hungry for a burger and had never been to Delux so thought I would give it a shot.  So let's start with the good, the fries were great.  They tasted good and love the little shopping cart.  Our waiter was really nice and friendly.  That is about all I was really impressed with.  My first impression on walking in was "it is very loud in here". Then looking at the seating I was thinking it should be fun sitting elbow to elbow with everyone in here.  Seats are very close together.  Not much room to enjoy your dinner and have a conversation.  Now the food.  I guess I just was not impressed by the food.  I had the Delux burger and it wasn't bad but not worth the price.  The beef may be good quality but it was not the best burger I have ever had.  I would probably not even put it up on the top 50% of burgers I have had.  I feel like if you say you have amazing burgers, then you should at least live up to the expectation.  My opinion is the burger fell short.  Other things that were not up to par was that the AC was not working very well.  I will say the owner came around and appologized for that and I think that was nice of him.  A confusing part of the place is the whole sushi thing.  Are you a burger place or a sushi place?  From what I have heard neither are amazing so maybe focus on one and do it well.  Also while our waiter was very friendly I would not say the service was great by any standards.  Not sure if I will try it again... maybe a sandwich next time???

We have been here several times and have had very good food each time.  It is a fun place.  The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is that it can get very loud sometimes.  It is a very good place to eat!

Always get great customer service here!  If you ever go here just ask for Janelle or Mitch.  They both are amazing.  So nice and helpful!  As long as they work there I will be shopping there.

We decided to try Switch for the first time on a Sunday afternoon.  It was at 2:30pm that we got there and the dining room was very empty, just a few tables of people.  We came in and there were several people working doing busy work, cleaning, rolling silverware, etc.  One of the yelled from a table she was sitting at that the host would be there to seat us in just a second.  5 or so minutes later the host comes up and seemed very annoyed.  He barely said two words to us and took us to our table.  He was pretty short and said "It is going to be a little bit because your server just got double sat".  I was kind of surprised by this because the dining room was very empty and there were at least 3 servers working.  Our server came over several minutes later and took our drink order.  He was very friendly but through the course of our meal he was not very attentive.    Now on to the food.  I was not very impressed.  We had the Switch burger and the  Spartan Chicken Pita.  The burger was just ok, it was not bad.  The chicken pita was dry, and just not good.  There was nothing that I would say was great.  It was more like on the edge of mediocre.  We were also with two friends, I can not speak for their food.  At the end of our meal our server brought our check and it was divided up for each person.  The problem was that he mixed everything up.  He didn't pay attention to which person had what items.  Things that I ordered were mixed up with things our friends ordered so we had to try to figure out our bill on our own.  Since there were only four of us I thought it wouldn't really be that hard for him to do but I guess I overestimated how difficult it was. Once we figured out what we needed to pay he picked up our money and when he came back he messed it all up again.  I just don't understand why it was so difficult.  We didn't have that many items.   I guess with all that said, I won't be back.  If you are into bad service and mediocre food you can get that at a number of other restaurants and pay a lot less.  Good luck if you go here.

I wanted to write an update to my previous review.  After my last review the owner sent us a gift card so we could try Switch again.  On Sunday we decided to try it again after we flew in from our vacation.  It was about 1pm and we were there during brunch.  We were greeted and sat right away which was great.  We had a different waiter this time and just like the last waiter we had he was very friendly.  The difference this time was that he was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  Also, I didn't say anything about having a gift card or about our last experience so he just flat out did a good job.  I believe his name was Angel.  He also did a good job of helping us decide on what food to get.  Both of our meals were good and our drinks were good as well.  I am pleased that we had a really good experience this time because I really like to support local businesses.  It really is nice to know that the owner cares about his business also.  Thank you again for the gift card and thanks to the staff for doing a good job.  We will be back.

Love Red Robin...just not this one.  Worst service I have had at any Red Robin.  We were there on a Monday night when it was not busy at all.  Our server was just plain slow.  Not sure what she was doing but we waited and waited to get anything from her.  Our drinks ran out several times.  Food was ok, my burger was over cooked.  It was well done instead of medium.  When we went to pay the server took our card and proceeded to take other orders before ever even running our card.  So once again we waited and waited.  She was standing at the bar after that and then finally went back by the kitchen got some drinks for another table and finally brought our card back...nearly fifteen minutes later.  No exaggeration. I will choose another Red Robin next time.

Nice place!  Really good drinks.  Love the art work... they may get me to buy something sometime!  It is just a nice place to come and drink and listen to music.  It has a really good vibe.  Great place to come if you just want to get out of the dance club bars and have a good drink with friends!

We decided to try this place on a Tuesday evening since we were staying at Caesars palace.  This place is no place you want to go.  This place is in need of remodel first. Second, the cleanliness is definitely in question.  Third, not one person on the staff smiled or was friendly.  From the hostess, to the manager, to the wait staff.  Last, our food was gross.  I have never had this bad of food at anywhere on the strip.  It was disgusting.  Do not take your kids here or yourself here.  Horrible experience.

First time here the other night. The food was really good. We both had a pasta dish and the flavors were great. The bread you get before the meal is delicious.  Not really feeling much of an Italian vibe from the restaurant but the food makes up for it. If you want good fresh Italian food at a reasonable price this is the place to go. There is no need to ever go to a chain Italian restaurant when you can go here. They also have good happy hour specials!

We went for our first time the other day for lunch. I really don't have a ton to say other than turkey burger was really good. Very flavorful. The truffle fries are amazing! The service is pretty good. The only complaint is if you sit on the patio beware of the flies. I have eaten outside alot at places but the flies here were out of control. I think the patio may be close to a trash area for the mall because it was really bad. With that said, eat inside because the food is worth it.

Have lived here a year and wish I would have never moved here. Unresponsive staff, trash always piles up (and you pay extra on your lease for trash removal), loud neighbors, etc.  While this place is very close to the light rail and businesses, it is stressful living here because you never know what kind of crap is going to happen.  We recently had a water main break which of course is not the fault of the complex.  We called at 7:15am to report we didn't have any water.  Five calls later still no response.  Finally got a call back around 11am from Scott. His message said they had a break and were hoping to have it fixed by the end of the day.  That is fine except in that message he said there are over 200 people without water and it is not possible to get back to everyone.  What he failed to realize is that we went to the office at 10am and the girl in the office had no clue what was going on and was sitting there doing nothing. You mean you could not have relayed the info and had her start calling residents??? This is just par for the course with living here. Don't move here!!!

We have been here twice and both times had really good food and decent service.  It is a small place but never has felt closed in.  When the weather permits they open the front doors to the patio to give it an open feel.  I really like the decor also.  We will be back again!

We decided to try Fuego because we had a Restaurant.com certificate.  We went around 4pm so the place was not busy at all. We were promptly helped.  The cocktails came very quick and were great.   The food came shortly after the cocktails and the food was extremely good.  I would recommend eating here.  I feel like the prices are reasonable and the food is very good.  Another bonus was the wait staff...super good looking!  :-)

I really loved the food.  The salads were very fresh and the options are incredible.  You can basically do anything you want!  I have not tried the other items yet but I really thought the salad I had was very good.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful when we were trying to figure out what we wanted.  One of the managers Emily came to our table after about 10 minutes and made sure our food was good.  You don't expect that in a "fast food" environment.  The store is a little off the main road but super easy to find!  We will definitely be going back soon!

Nice place!  Very good drink specials.  Music could stand to be a little louder just for the fun factor.  I think they were having some music player issues but I am sure they will get that all figured out.  I have been here a few times and I really like it!

I am still keeping my rating at 4 stars because I really like this place.  I am just updating my review because the last 5 or 6 times in I have been disappointed by the bartenders.  The drinks have been mediocre and they have not been that friendly.  I don't mind waiting for a drink if I have to on a busy night but if I have to wait I do expect my drink to be good and the bartender to be nice.  I know there are always kinks to work out in the first year of business so I am going to continue to support this establishment.  The one thing that has been consistent is the owner.  Stacey is always very friendly when we come in. It is still a nice fun place!

Went here for the first time a week ago.  Got sat right away on a busy Saturday night even though they were pretty packed.  We ordered drinks and the waitress looks at my ID and says "wow you are old.  I mean that in a good way because you don't look that old."  Hmmm...  really?  Anyway, the food was really good, the drinks were good, and we enjoyed our meal.  So all in all it was a good experience.

My friend Emily and I decided to stop in and see this store.  I already have an ecig and Emily wanted one. Neither of us knew much about them (even myself since a friend gave me mine).  Brian was the person working and he took the time to show us the different products and explained to us how they work.  He was knowledgeable about everything and helped Emily find the one that would work for how much she would use it.  He was also very knowledgeable about the different kinds of juice.  I really appreciate good customer service and I hope people will frequent this business.  p.s. Blackberry Champagne is the juice to get!!!!!

What an amazing place!  If you want jeans made right for you then this is the place.  You have a couple choices for your jeans.  You can buy the premade styles they have there and they will hem the lengths to fit or you can pay a bit more and get exactly what you want from the denim, to the stitching, to the buttons.  It is so great!  We walked in on a whim and we were greeted right away and had things in the store explained.  They use 100 year old machines to make jeans the old way and they are incredible quality.  I can not wait to get some jeans here!  Prices are so reasonable!!!

When Mejico opened I was very happy to have another nice restaurant in the area.  My friend and I were able to finally get in a try the food.  We went on a week night so it was not very busy.  There were two other tables that had people eating.  We sat right down and looked at the menus.  It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to actually get to us which is a long time considering it was not busy.  We placed our order and got our food in a reasonable time.  The food was really underwhelming.  The flavor was just ok.  The price was terribly high for the amount of food and the taste.  There was nothing that made this food stand apart from anywhere else.  I got the enchiladas and they were around $15.  I could have gotten the exact same meal at about 10 other places in the area for about $7. I asked for sour cream because the food wasn't very flavorful.  They didn't have any???? The waiter brought out some kind of salad dressing?  Not quite sure what it was.  As for the service, our waiter was friendly but really did not take very good care of us.  We waited for everything.  Water, service...everything. All the while we could here him talking up a storm around the corner from the bar.  Our entire experience was just not good.  It is a real shame because it is very cute on the inside and inviting. I was really hoping for much more.  Disappointing.

If you are looking for good BBQ at a reasonable price then this is the place to go.  When we walked in we were greeted and we decided what to get. I got the two meat platter. It comes with 2 side dishes which you have a lot of options to choose from. I picked brisket and spicy cheddar sausage. Both were very good. The brisket wasn't dry which is sometimes hard to do. The platter was $12.  I think if you just want a good and fast BBQ plate just come here. Food is good and service was friendly and fast. Plus you get free ice cream!

This was my first time there since it changed to Los Diablos.  We walked in and sat with our friends and the waiter came over and asked us what we wanted to drink.  We were not ready for alcohol yet since we were going to eat.  We ordered two waters and a coke.  He seemed annoyed that we didn't order drinks.  He asked if we were going to get food and we said yes.  At that point he brought menus.  We looked over the menus and waited for our drinks.  He quickly came over and brought the drinks and hurried away without asking if we were ready to order (which we were).  A conservative estimate is that we waited 10 minutes... maybe even 15 minutes and he never came back.  I asked another server if we could order food.  He then went and go our server.  When he came back he was confused that we wanted food even though we told him we wanted food and he brought us menus.  Two of us wanted the hangover burger that was listed on the menu.  He was quite rude and told us that was on the brunch menu and we could not have it.  (The menu is really hard to read so you don't really know what you are ordering.) After he told us that then my friend asked if we could have that burger made just buy using the "build your own burger" part of the menu.  Everything that is offered on that brunch menu burger is available on the build your own burger menu so it seemed like a pretty easy request.  He was just not understanding.  I told him once I just wanted was offered on the hangover burger.  My friend told him the same thing.  He was so incredibly rude and snapped at my friend and said, "You are being incredibly difficult!"  My friend said, "No we are not, we are just ordering what is on your menu."  At that point I told him we no longer wanted food and I paid for my coke and we left.  I won't be back.  This was unacceptable service and there are lots of other options for food and drinks in the area.  It was a real shame because the place looked really nice and it looks like it could have been a cool place to go.  My other observation was the size of the menu for such a small place.  It was a huge menu.  I would be surprised if this place stays around for any length of time.  Hopefully my incident is isolated.. who knows!

So here is the skinny. We tried out this place today. It is kind of weird. I guess you seat yourself.  There is no one to really seat you and no sign directing you. We got a menu and sat down. We ordered water to drink since it was very hot outside. We decided on some food and it came out fairly quick. I had the sandwich with a mix of meats. I had to order the side extra, for the prices a side should have come with it. My sandwich with a side was over $14 dollars. My friend ordered a platter which as 2 meats and includes 1 side. It is $13. His meat was very dry and it was two small slices of beef. The chicken was a small pile of chicken. It is all served on a cafeteria tray with plastic silverware. These prices are nicer restaurant prices. We asked for refills on our water and Stacey told us the drinks are self serve but he would get it for us this time. Self serve? For these prices our food should be on plates, with silverware, and we shouldn't have to get up, walk clear across the restaurant and get ourselves a refill. Bottom line, go to Famous Dave's. It will cost you the same and you will get better service and not leave wondering why you paid so much for so little. (Service and food)  Side note...they should probably cover the wires hanging from the ceiling. The place looks not finished.

I will start with saying the food we ordered tasted good.  It was flavorful and was ok.  I had the burger with mushroom on it and I liked it.    This is what you need to know when you eat here.  I had a burger and fries... NO DRINK.  My bill just for myself was almost $14.  There was nothing about this food or the service that warranted being 14 bucks.  I was not impressed with the service and the food was not larger portions by any means.  I can get the same caliber burger or better at nearly any restaurant in Phoenix.  Think about this, you can get a steak with sides and salad for that price at Texas Road House.  Just a thought.  I probably would not go back here because their prices are those of a sit down restaurant... this is a fast food burger joint.  The prices should match.  Not worth it at all. Also, for the price they are charging they can do way better on the cleanliness of the dining area.

Positive: Nice decor. Seated right away. Not so positive: Let's start with cocktails. 9 dollars for cocktails. Not very good ones at that and they were very small. I am pretty sure there wasn't much for alcohol in the Austin Mule. I am a light weight and I didn't feel a thing. We ordered the appetizer fried green tomatoes.  They were just ok. Not great. If southern food is your thing then I think fried green tomatoes is something you should do absolutely amazingly.  They just weren't.  We opted not to order any more food because it was priced rather expensive from the start. Price is not an issue when you get value for your money, but when  there didn't seem to be much justifying the high prices we skipped the rest of meal. I am not sure if we will go back. It is disappointing because we high hopes for a new restaurant in the neighborhood.  On a positive note, go have a glass of wine at the cute bookstore next to the restaurant.
