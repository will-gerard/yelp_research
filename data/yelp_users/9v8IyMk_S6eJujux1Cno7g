Great place to sit outside & enjoy an afternoon with a friend, especially since the AZ weather is startin to cool slightly!  There were mostly business types and tourists dining around us.  We chatted over drinks while taking in the water fountains @ the AZ Center and soaking up comfortably warm sun rays.  While waiting for our food, we grazed on chips that resembled a mix of real tortilla chips and some potato puffs that reminded me of Munchos.  Except the things that looked & crunched like Munchos had a slightly sweet taste.  I ordered the blackened fish tacos.  My plate came with the double shelled tacos with a zesty sauce and a choice of toppings for you to spoon yourself--black beans, spicy coleslaw mix & Spanish rice.  AT the end of the meal, they brought out white chocolate that had been chilled & wrapped in a corn husk.  It was just enough to satisfy a dessert craving without making you feel like crap, if you'd decided to order dessert after a deliciously filling meal.  The only drawback is that the prices are a lil high--$10.95 for my Orange Beso margarita, which was poured @ the table.  (The server left the remainder in the shaker for me to imbibe).  And my taco plate was around $10 too.

K, so I'm totally mourning the official end of the Suns 2007-08 Season.  I wanted to rip off my O'Neal 32 shirt & sub-in for Nash, especially during the 4th last night---rrrrrrr!  My lovely San Antonio siblings are sending me a broom & Parker jersey as I write.  Anyway, I wanted to end it on a positive note, so I've decided to post about my Suns experience at the center....  Parking--You know, I never realized how much impact parking has on my overall experience until I started writing reviews...Anyway, parking for an event is a non-issue if you don't mind walking a few blocks to the center.  I parked off of 1st & Lincoln near an economically depressed area , with streets in serious need of repaving but @ the end of the night, my car was still there, unharmed.  Definite plus.  Seating/visibility--We sat in the 'upper deck' but with the way the center is designed, I had decent visibility of the court, despite the dismal lighting.  I felt slightly dizzy seated so high, with the low lighting and constant action all around me...And IMO, I felt there was entirely too much seating allocated to "CASINO ARIZONA". They pretty much take up an entire section.  I don't know who gets to sit there but it pissed me off.    Entertainment--I appreciated that they didn't do the random cam that identifies people on a jumbotron with the caption instructing people to '________'--you fill in the blank.  I've seen this @ hockey games, baseball, etc & always wondered how they avoided selecting two totally random people sitting next to each other to hug/kiss.  Or why the jumbotron always makes people actually get up and do the funky chicken dance.  Maybe it's magic....Anyway, I thought they did some cool stuff like give away a car, launch a jilion shirts into the crowd, and of course the gorilla was on hand to impress us with his slam dunking skills.  He was of course, aided by a trampoline, but who cares?  It's a slam dunking gorilla.  At the end of the night, the Suns beat the Blazers, so it was alllllllll goooooood!  Oh yeah AND I won some arena football tickets.  Yea.  I think.

The first time I went to OT's was a Friday night with a small group that frequented this place and thought I'd like it.  Parking is always a concern and I appreciated that there was ample space in a well-lit structure nearby.  There was no cover that night and we end up posted at the bar, since there weren't any tables left, while the jazz band was still playing.  The bartenders definitely took care of us that night and we made sure to tip well.  The music was good and we were all enjoying the vibe and the opportunity to celebrate the wknd!    After the band wrapped up, it got really crowded and a DJ started playing a lot of bangin' hip hop.  They even took it old school during last call with Blackstreet's "Before I let you go".  We had a great time dancing and met a lot of cool people.  Generally, the crowd is pretty laid back and chill.  I'd definitely make the long trek again.

I was surprised to find myself driving in an industrial area seeking an address among rows of non-descript buildings, assuming mapquest was leading me to a normal storefront.  After a few wrong turns and confirming with a trucker that I was supposed to enter through the loading dock door, I finally arrived. Pruitt's converted a section of their warehouse into a makeshift show room, sans the typical room exhibits. Although the showroom furniture was cordoned off by rope, it was a little distracting to see/hear the staff whiz around with forklifts.    As shoppers continued to sit/lay on/inspect various furniture pieces, warehouse staff kept unwrapping additional stock.  Many of the items were brand new and consisted of discontinued items.  The best deal was a vanilla colored love seat for $97 however I was on a mission for a sectional, that seemed doomed for failure.  Just as I was about to leave, someone began removing plastic from a large L-shaped couch and I held my breath with anticipation....It was love at first site....Chocolate colored, velvety fabric, and a jillion inviting pillows.  I sat in the corner of the sectional; then stretched out fully to ensure it was the right fit--It was perfect.  When I pulled myself up, I flagged down an associate to confirm there was one in stock for delivery.  Less than a week later, the deliverymen set up my new sectional in front of the big screen.  I've fallen asleep on my comfy sectional many, many times.

Love Nordy's.  Love the Nordy's Rack.  Lived here for 2 yrs before I realized AZ had a 'Rack'!  I thought the only discount Nordy's was the horrendous 'Last Chance' store on Camelback.  Ew.  So, after a night of fun and wakin up on a couch @ a friend's place in Phx, I take the short trip to Scottsdale to check it out.  Compared to the LBC Rack that I used to frequent back in the day, the Scottsdale version was a lil more cluttered.  The layout reminded me of a geometric puzzle--the entire store was a square box but the way the sections were organized inside were jagged shapes of various sizes (See this link for an example http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Make_a_tangram.svg/585px-Make_a_tangram.svg.png).  Despite the oddly shaped layout pertaining mostly to the women's/juniors sections, the store was well-kept with great signage.  I didn't find any potential career pieces but did manage to find an awesome pair of ass huggin Lucky jeans.  For 1/2 price.  And didn't look like they were from my high school days.  That alone made it worth the trip!

Never been here despite all the people I've heard that raved about it, especially during my LA days.  So, on my last day as an AZ resident a friend recommended we meet there for lunch, which I looked forward to with excitement.  For a Tuesday, it was hella crowded with old peeps.  I thought I'd left Sun City behind but apparently the ones that have alternate forms of transportation (e.g., a real car vs the golf cart) all descended on Mimi's the day I went.  I agree with Kimberly S on decor--super tacky.  It was like a french cafe and american diner mated & the offspring resulted in a Dennys frame with a French Quarter and generic diner inspired outfit.    They brought out a small basket of assorted sweet breads before our meal--pumpkin bread, sourdough roll & something resembling a dark but sweet bread with raisins.  I ordered the split pea soup with ham bits--standard fare that was thick but tasty.    We decided to share dessert & ordered the classic ensemble.  Included in this sampler were an apple crisp served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a bread pudding doused with too much melted butter, and a brownie with with another scoop of ice cream & chocolate syrup.  Definitely more sugar than one should consume in a month, even if you don't consume the small portions in their entirety.    The crowd of demanding, cranky faced old people, slow waitress, and average food has inspired me to stay away.  Unless I'm hungry & someone offers me a free meal.  And no other places are open within a 100 mile radius.

Last Cinco de Mayo wknd, I decided it was time to replace the factory tires that originally came on my '03 Highlander.  Yeah, I know.  Most people are more ahead of the game than I am on car maintenance but at least I got in there before I blew a tire...  Staff get bonus points for friendly, customer service.  The guys in there helped me select practical options within my price range.  No pushy sales tactics to get me to buy something I didn't want or need.  My estimated wait time was a little over an hour despite the hoard of people in the shop on a Friday night.    They accidentally 'recycled' the regular sized spare tire I recently placed on my front wheel axel instead of returning it to the trunk area--when the new tires were added.  After I explained the situation, they ordered a brand new regular sized tire for me--free of charge for their error.  AAA has also told me that if you purchase tires here they patch flats for free.  These guys rock.  You gotta go there next time you need tires.

HH is the kind of place you go to when you're low on cash, it's Monday night & you are willing to drive to pick up your food.  They used to offer a medium 1-topping pizza for $5.55 on Monday nights.  Last wk when I called to order the special, they said it changed to a large for $5.99.  The beauty of this offer is that you don't have to buy 3 pizzas to get that price like the other chains!!!!!  With the economy in the toilet, I was astounded that they increased the size thereby improving the value for my hard earned dollars.    As for taste & quality--it's pretty good.  I like to order the thin crust and usually get sausage or pepperoni anything extra, I add on myself (e.g., red onion, black olives, etc).  They don't glop on the sauce or skimp on the cheese & I've never rec'd a burnt/nearly burnt pizza.  It's even pretty good reheated.

Beware:  The photos online are much better than reality.  Compared to the perfectly lit hotel shots, it was as if I were wearing a set of tinted glasses when I actually saw it with my own 2 eyes. The hotel entrance is grand with art sculptures but gave the impression it had seen its heyday in the early 80s. The furniture & decor were in muted tones of coppery brown.  It all seemed very blah.  I zipped up to the 16th floor in a speedy glass elevator and on my way to the room, appreciated a spectacular view of Chase Field and surrounding area below.  Downside -Free WiFi is only on the first floor -Water bottles in the room are $6 -The pool had ample lounge seating for the sun worshippers but was only 3 ft deep.  The entire configuration of the pool was awkward at best and discouraged any lap swimming.   -Elevators are small and seem smaller when riding with people don't have a sense of personal space boundaries  Upside -Pristine white down comforters and luxurious pillows made me feel like I was sleeping on a puffy cloud -Location is walking distance to the mall, US Airways Center, starbucks, Matt's Restaurant (see review on Matt's) and a few nightspots  -There's a decent hotel restaurant with spacious outdoor seating and a bagel shop on the premises -Even on a busy Friday night, I was able to locate street parking that saved me $10, had I parked in a public garage -Check out is noon but the hotel graciously gave us an additional hour to check out since my friend's conference ended at noon  Overall, I wouldn't stay here if I had a choice.  I only ended up here b/c I was crashing my friend's last conference night in the hotel and it made it easier for us to do hang out in Phx that night.

OMG--I love this place.  My new AZ friends host an annual Mardi Gras party with a live band and I received my invite at the end of December, reminding me to start thinking about a costume.  I had no idea what to wear and decided to find a costume shop online for ideas.  Easley's presented itself as the only real option that was close (even though it took 40 mins to get there from Surprise) and boasted a host of costumes that could be rented or purchased.  This was great for 2 reasons--I didn't want to buy a costume that I'd only wear for 1 night if it were going to cost more than $30 and didn't have the time/patience to throw something together as I heard many of the past partygoers suggest.  (I do have a normal day job & sewing is not one of my domestic skills!)  Upon arrival, the storefront looked smaller than I imagined.  I assumed it would be like a Costco warehouse b/c there were so few costume stores in the Phoenix area, and if this were 'it' for costume stores, I just thought it would be aisles and aisles of costumes where I might have to push around one of those oversized carts and then buy a polish hotdog afterward b/c I'd be so famished from shopping.  But that was not the case.  In this compact little space, they organized the store very well and utilized every possible inch of wall space to display what they didn't have room for on the floor.  Since Mardi Gras was a few weeks away when I was shopping, they had racks of rental costumes and an entire section with accessories.  I found what I needed quickly--a floor length cape for $25 and a huge gold crown.  It was perfect.  (Please note, that although the Mardi Gras costumes were my main concern & the focus of this post, they had a ton of other things in there).  While I was waiting in line, I couldn't help but notice how many different varieties of bunny head masks they had for rent.  There must have been about 15 different bunny heads mounted on display.  Who knew bunny costume renters would be so particular about the facial features on a bunny head....?

Furio's is fabulous on Monday nights for Martini's & Mani's.  I absolutely loved having my nails done while sippin on a cosmo.  We were scheduled for 5PM enabling us to be the first nail customers.  Then we had a few more martinis while gabbing & waiting for our nails to dry.  We didn't dine there but heard they have great food.  An added plus was the flat screen over the bar that allowed us to keep an eye on the MNF game.  Would definitely return if I get the chance!

After reading many posts about great places for cupcakes in Phx, I set out on a quest to find a local bakery to brag about near me.  I spied this bakery on the way home and decided to check out the goods one afternoon.  It was completely empty except for a 6 year old boy bored out of his mind waiting for his late 50s granny to quit reading the weekly Basha ads.    Despite the underwhelming crowd, 2  1/2 of the 4 display cases were packed to the gills with everything from: black & whites, fruit pies, canolis, fruit tarts, GIANT petit fours (aren't petit fours supposed to be bite sized?), chocolate éclairs on steroids, muffins, danishes, loaf cakes, biscotti, and too many types of cookies to list.  All items seemed priced in the 75 cent-$2 range, which isn't bad.  Behind the counter were bread baskets with freshly baked breads--french, sour dough, rye, etc.    The woman behind the counter reminded me of Seinfeld's soup nazi.  If the soup nazi had a cousin, it would be this lady.  She was stern and impatient even though the shop was empty.  When I probed her about the items, she was curt and offered no real recommendation on popular items.  It seemed like all the things I selected were made with the same "cookie bottom" and different topping/filling flavor--apple, blueberry, raspberry, cinnamon. I could've missed it but I didn't see ANY cupcakes...  I settled on a raspberry linzer cookie and a sugar free apple pie.  The cookie was thick and cakey--slightly crisp around the edges and spongy in the thickest parts.  The apple pie was empanada sized and was made with real apples that gave it some tartness--no goopy canned crap here.  Both were 'g-double-o-d' good.  They also had whole cakes in a refrigerated case next to the carbonated beverages.  While this place had plenty of seating, it didn't give an inviting impression.  The seats and tables were like something from an 80s office break room void of comfort and style.  However, I will admit that I thought the baked goods were definitely worth putting up with the militant counter person.    Oh yeah they're open on the 4th, so stop by if you don't know what to bring to the soirée/pool party/BBQ you're going to.

The NECS is located in a strip mall area anchored by a Coco's Restaurant and other popular stores frequented by the geriatric crowd (e.g., shoe repair store, HR Block, etc).  The two small, Asian women working the shop were pleasant, greeting all customers that entered with soft, cheerful voices.  They seemed like the type of people you just wanna hug, even though you know absolutely zero about their lives/personalities.  Store layout--When you walk in, the small storefront is covered wall to wall with clocks of varying themes, designs, and prices.  They also carry a nice selection of grandfather clocks and sophisticated desk clocks that you might present on a special occasion to an office colleague or employer.  Watches--The register is directly in front of the door about 20 feet in, and once you make it to the register, to the right is an entire section of mens & womens watches with a multitude of bands and colors imaginable.  They are all priced between $10-14 and for fashion watches, are fun to peruse.  I believe I spied a few glass cases with some higher priced watches of the Seiko brand.  I didn't look closely but doubt this place had any designer watches, which probably speaks to their clientele.    Other inventory--They also carry an assortment of things I imagine are appealing to their main demographic--the 65+ crowd.  They had fancy, marble covered pill boxes, rings with large gemstones that hid digital watches underneath, and little table top trinkets in the shape of objects you'd find in a home (e.g., piano, toilet, etc) that incorporated a miniature (and functional!) clock face into the design.  If my grandmother, who resides deep in the South Pacific, had use for a dollhouse-sized toilet with a clock, I'd definitely buy one.  Hours--They're usually only open 8-5PM, M-F and 8 or 9-4PM on Sat.  So, if you're too busy to check it out during lunch hour and can't make it before 5PM, you're out of luck.  Customer service--They are pretty darn fast, even when there's a crowd.  You can watch them replace your battery while you wait and that takes about 5 minutes.  I even had them remove some of the links on a watch I purchased from their store.  They didn't charge me for removing the links and for my other watch, it only cost $2.50 to replace the battery.  I'd definitely recommend this store for expediency and customer service!

Small, easily accessible, clean, and all around fantastic.  Reminded me of my all time fave airport in the OC, John Wayne without the LA traffic.  No drama from arrival to the baggage check, rental center, check-in and security.  Convenience and comfort are the 2 descriptors that are top of mind when thinking about my experience there, which isn't the regular in most airports.  Luv it!

First, I must state that I am not a baseball fan.  I love playing &/or watching most sports (e.g., NCAA football & NFL, NBA, UFC, pro-boxing, volleyball, pro-tennis, world cup soccer, and occasionally will watch pro-golf) but baseball has been one of those sports I can only enjoy when I'm actually at a game.    So, when my cousins (who are HUGE baseball fans) asked if I wanted to go to the Season Opener for the Dbacks, I naturally agreed, especially since I had never been to Chase Field and wanted to check it out.    I worried about parking b/c having lived/attended many sporting events in LA, parking was always a nightmare in terms of traffic & cost.  (If I went to a USC football game, I usually ended up paying $25 to park on my own campus!)  However, I arrived about an hour before the game started and was able to park about 5-6 short blocks away on a side street--FOR FREE.    We meet up and as we walk into this mammoth place, I am amazed at how brand-spanking new everything appeared for being 10 yrs old.  (I was recently in the Cardinals new stadium but all the concrete and redzone lighting made it seem a lot older than a few years).  There seemed to be a variety of food & drink options available and although there were about 50K people there I didn't feel claustrophobic walking around before/during/after the game.  There were a few irritating moments during my visions of grandeur: 1.  I paid $8 for a large miller lite--which was about 20 or 24 oz. and 2.  The BRAND NEW plasma movie sized screen only showed replays.  Now, I KNOW I was there and to watch the action on the field but it would've been nice to have that option, especially since we were sitting in the nose bleed section off the first base line.  Getting to our seats was simple but the climb up/down those steps was a little scary.  I'm not afraid of heights but it seemed pretty damn steep.  Overall, though I had a fantastic time!!!!!  The weather was perfect, as the game started at 6:30 and with the roof open it wasn't ridiculously hot.  There were fireworks.  The D-backs hit a few homers & crushed the Dodgers.  And...I got to spend quality time with my family ; )  I would definitely go again.

I've only had 'good times' @ Barcelona so I have very few complaints about the joint.  There is definitely an eclectic mix of people that go there but I think that's what makes it fun.  I met an Eastern European fighter, slow danced to Sinatra with the owner of a foreign auto dealership, and encountered a funny old man who must've been about 90 that somehow got on stage to shake his groove thang with the female singer.  He later came to our table and after my friend complimented his dance moves, he blew in her ear and said "You know what that was?  I just gave you a blow job."  Whoa--LOL!  I do agree that it's strange to buy drinks in the ladies room and that some chicks seem to lounge on the couch in there, checkin out other chicks when they walked through the door.  I felt like I was bein judged before a panel, whenever I passed the couch!  And I haven't seen the cougars but have definitely come across my disproportionate share of the 'J. Howard Marshall' types.    All in all, the only reason I can't give this place 4 stars is b/c of the outrageous drink prices.

TOTALLY GAUDY BUT GREAT! Spent my 26th birthday wknd here.  It also happened to be my first trip to Vegas, despite living in LA since I was 18--imagine that!  Anyhow, we stayed in suite with a step down living room and all the gold in that place made me wear my stunna shades--LOL!!!  Definitely check out the V-Bar.  The drinks are unique and this place is definitely for the 'grown and sexy'.

After a late night out with a few college buddies, we woke up @ the downtown Hyatt starving for a hearty meal.  Einstein Bro's Bagels located downstairs, wasn't gonna satisfy our insatiable craving for some rib-stickin, home cooked food.    When we arrive, there are people milling about the exterior of this tiny restaurant, sipping orange infused water provided by the staff.  We assumed it must be excellent, if these people were willing to wait in the sweltering heat for a coveted seat.  After 15-20 minutes, we feel like celebrities on the VIP list as we're escorted through the door.  I order the Hog & Chick, which provided more than enough hash browns, eggs, toast, and sausage to quell the lumberjack appetite I developed.    The staff was friendly & fast, attentive to our dwindling water glasses and clearing plates quickly.  We were more than pleased with the meal, hospitality and price point--happy to walk a little of this hearty breakfast off, on the way back to the hotel.

"It looks shady outside but trust me--It's fabulous inside!"  When a friend guarantees 'fabulous' who can resist?  So, after taking 17S (when I shoulda taken the 17N) from the 10 and showing up 20 mins late, I'm irritable b/c it's blazin hot outside, I've wasted gas, and the skepticism starts to set in, as I pull into the small parking lot next to what looks like an abandon 3-story motel.  The front door is unmarked and fashioned out of the metal commonly seen on tool boxes embedded in pick up trucks.  For all I knew, it was the service entrance and after wandering to the Grand Avenue side, where I assumed the front door was located, I return to the shiny metal door.  The door flies open and I step into a swank little place with a beautiful mahogany bar, flat paneled screens, and various paintings on the wall.  My friend introduces me to Renee, (the owner) and in an instant I go from being the 'new' person to feeling like a regular.  At one point in the evening, the generous man seated next to me, buys everyone at the bar a shot and we all toast to making new friends.  Before the night is over, I sing back up with another regular, while my friend takes lead vocals on a song during karaoke.  This is the kinda bar where the patrons make you feel like an old friend and you don't have to worry about dress code or obnoxious aholes.  The crowd is a mix of couples & singles, twenty-something's and older folks that just want to hang out and relax.  I didn't go outside but noticed a pleasant looking patio with misters.  Happy hour is technically from 4-6PM but the drink prices are so modest, it's a non-issue.  They also host various events during the wk.  Wednesday is karaoke night, Thursday live bands play and Fridays there's a DJ.    I absolutely adore this place and agree with my friend--it IS fabulous!  (4 stars only b/c the bathroom accomodates 1 person @ a time)

The restaurant has open, spacious seating and I was immediately overcome with deja vu.  Then it hit me--this is the islander's version of Chipotle!!!  The only difference between Rumbi & Chipotle (well besides the food!)--is the tableside service.  You get your order/pay for your food and they bring your food to your table.  Interior--There is a huge menu mounted on a waist high podium near the front door and as you walk along the wall to the front counter, there are plenty of opportunities to pick up a paper menu.  The decor incorporates faux bamboo, dried palm leaves strategically draped and many surf/island related motifs.  Food--The menu selection is great.  Not too many items to overwhelm and just enough of the staples to appease most appetites--rice bowls with several protein options (including tofu), sandwiches, soups, salads, and a few island plates.  They even offer a select variety of wines and beer.  One of my new favorites is a Kona Lager you can of course, purchase at Rumbis.  (I bought a 6 pack @ Bevmo a while ago and it's phenomenal!)  I ordered the half size rice bowl with luau pork.  This portion is actually large enough to feed 2 small children or a really hungry adult.  The pork was served with teriyaki sauce on the side, which I discarded because the seasoning on the pork was sufficient.  I appreciated that they offered varieties of rice (including brown & a rumbi version--not sure I recall reading what was in that but it was nice to have options).  They provide a nice serving of mixed veggies to round out the meal.    My experience--I enjoyed the casual atmosphere, the service was speedy, and the food was great for no more than $8.  It's a great place to grab a quick lunch or chat leisurely over a meal.

This is definitely one of my favorite grocery stores b/c I can usually find everything I need here at better prices than even the larger 'discount' warehouse across the street.  The bulk section is my favorite b/c it allows me to try out new things without committing to an entire package of something that I may not ever want to use/consume again.    The other benefit to shopping here is that the portions are usually for things I can handle as a single person.  For example, I bought a 5 lb bag of flour for a recipe that required 1 cup.  Now I have a 5 lb bag of flour on my shelf minus a cup.  This was back in the day before I discovered the bulk bins @ Sprouts.  Now, I can buy cheese in small containers anywhere from $1.25+ and heck, if I wanted flax seed, I could get as little or as much as I wanted from the bulk bins.  I probably won't buy flax seed anytime soon but the point is I have reasonable options people!!!!

Ok, so this ISN'T new.  It is actually a correction.  I didn't realize until I dropped off my car this morning that there's another place with a VERY similar name--SORRY!    I kept getting coupons in the mail for this place, so I decided to check it out.  I recently had an auto repair shop tell me I needed to replace both front & rear brakes and wanted a second quote before forking over cash I didn't really want to part with.    They did a full inspection and not only negated what the first auto place told me but provided a report showing how much 'brake' life I had left before I needed to bring it in for replacement.  They could've just taken my money but this demonstrated they wanted to keep me as a customer and that's exactly what they got.  I now take my car there for routine oil changes and other work (e.g., engine flush, etc) when necessary.  7/1/08  Just dropped off my car for routine service.  They've now added free wifi for customers who want to wait @ the shop.  I luv me some free wifi.

I went to Sportsman's for a networking event last wk & really liked it.  We were able to use a section near the door that had cushy seating and oversize chairs.  It was a good spot for our group of around 20-30.  It's difficult to comment on cost b/c the event was complimentary and we ordered a few plates with fruit, cheeses, meats and olives that were perfect with the wines.  They even had a wine tasting area in the rear of the store that was a nice feature I haven't seen at the other local wine bars.  Service was great and I had no complaints there.

Our wknd suite was the bomb like dot com!  We had 6 girls posted in 2 large rooms over Pro Bowl wknd.    LOCATION:  was PERFECT for us, since most of us have frequented Vegas over the years and walking the strip wasn't a 'must do'.  Plus the indoor mall provided tons of shopping opportunities.  We literally didn't have to drive anywhere if we didn't want to.  CUSTOMER SERVICE:  We flew a red eye & arrived by 10AM.  Being exhausted from the flight, we asked if we could check in early & they not only let us, they didn't charge a fee.  They were really nice about everything the whole wknd & we definitely thought the 'ANYTHING/ANYTIME' speed dial was a great touch!  SUITE:  AMAZING!!!  A 2 bdrm w/a living space in between was fabulous.  We had a small kitchen with a fridge, convection oven, & dishwasher.  The living room shades doubled as a projection screen & there was a slide projector mounted from the ceiling.  The master bedroom had less living room furniture than the other room but that was largely due to the fact that 1/3 of the room was taken up by the jacuzzi!

When our bus/tram from the airport rolled up, the site was still partially under construction but nearly done.  This meant that the slot machines in the lobby weren't operational and some of the entrances were closed but all the car rental desks were open.  We were able to access our rental quickly and like the Phx Car Rental Center, it was fab!

Food--The fire roasted garlic tomato soup is excellent.  They sprinkle tortilla chips for garnish over a tiny dollop of sour cream.  Mmmmm.  Yummy.  The mixed green salad with albacore tuna is also a delightful choice, as is the turkey wrap and CA Chicken sandwich with pesto mayo.  Drip coffee and espresso drinks are good, too.  Overall, everything tastes great because it's made fresh.  No pre-packaged items here.  Seating--Lots of booths and tables inside and out.  They have a cozy little set up with what looks to be 'lounge' chairs that accommodates 6 with swivel tables perfect, for savoring your beverage of choice.  The rest of the dining area looks like it has capacity for about 100 people, if all seats were filled despite a placard declaring the maximum capacity is '311'.  Peak times--avoid lunchtime during the weekdays.  It would appear that all of Surprise is feenin for a sandwich or soup/salad special from PB during 11-1PM.  The lines are long and you can forget about getting back to work in under an hour if you factor in commute time, food prep & consumption.  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.  The only time service has been 'fast' is during breakfast.  I've been there for a breakfast networking event and on a Saturday.  During these times, I received my order promptly and had little trouble locating a table.  Free stuff--this would include WiFi, bread samples with tasty spreads, muffin and/or cookie bits.  Bonus points for free stuff!  PB is open Mon-Sat 7AM-9PM and Sun 7AM-6PM.

Great place for drinks & sports viewing.  There are about a jillion huge screens with everything from football, baseball, surfing, racing, etc on tv.  Nice outdoor patio, comfy lounge chairs, some video games & pool table.  Reverse happy hour from 10PM-2AM is a plus!  Would totally come back.

I've been here a handful of times now.  The atmosphere is one that invites you to stay a while and hang out with friends or enjoy a solitary time out from the world "over coffee".  There are local groups that organize meetings onsite and a host of activities designed to bring people together.  I've hosted a few meetings there and appreciate that Over Coffee is using their business to foster a sense of community in the rapidly growing west side.  Other positives: -FREE WIFI!!!! -Wall outlets I could plug my laptop battery into -Clean, open space with lots of tables/seating (including outdoor seating) -4 Oversized comfy chairs, with board games on the coffee table -Friendly staff -Smoothie menu -Prices comparable to the national/chain coffee shops -They promote other small businesses  Negatives -Food not so great.  I had an apple pastry once that was somewhat stale.  The other minimal selections in the pastry case didn't seem so appetizing (e.g., cake donuts, cold danishes, plastic wrapped bagels).  Overall, I'd definitely recommend checking this place, when you need a break from the Starbucks & CBTLs.

Attended a networking mixer here.  The venue was perfect for the group and we milled about in a room that was filled exclusively by the guests, while others sat at the L-Shaped bar.  It's the first coffee house where I actually felt like lingering as long as humanly possible, with its low lighting & swank decor.  Everyone enjoyed the varieties of wine, desserts & staff hospitality.  Now, if only they had another one closer to the Surprise folks!

In CA, Cracker Barrel was associated with a block of cheese at the grocer not a restaurant with country cooking. My first tummy luvin encounter with CB was in WI a few yrs ago. Imagine my delight when I spied one in Peoria right off the 101.  Went there for dinner and ordered the sampler, which featured a little bit of everything--chicken & dumplings, a small slice of meatloaf, and a thin piece of ham with 2 sides of your choice. While we waited, we entertained ourselves with the Peg Game to determine whether our college years taught us anything of value. It confirmed that any aspirations to be a professional math-lete or economist at RAND were hopeless.   The food was delicious and did not disappoint--the chicken & dumplings had white gravy and the ham complimented the greens I ordered.  Unfortunately, the meatloaf seemed a little dry and bland, despite the tomato based sauce on top. As if we didn't have enough food, the meal was also served with cornbread and biscuits.  The sampler was a great way to evaluate options without committing to a single entree.    After dinner, we socialized outside on the rocking chairs with our east side friends. I engaged in a checkers challenge on the oversized board and soon became painfully aware that the low table was forcing me to mimic the posture of the hunch back of notre dame.  At that point, the quaint little rocking chairs lost their appeal as I strategized my victory.  Overall we had a pleasant time & definitely recommend CB when you're in the mood for comfort food in a family style restaurant.

CHOCO-YUM-YUMS are here!!!  This specialty shop showcases select, handmade chocolates all hand crafted in the store.  A wall of pre-packaged chocolates in various sizes and prices are displayed on multiple shelves along one wall.  In the center of the room are glass cases, exhibiting all the truffle possibilities available.  They also sell blocks of fudge, if you're not in the mood for truffles.  I inquired as to the most popular selections and was directed to the raspberry stardust & Arboli truffles.  To round out my 4-pack, I also selected the hazelnut toffee & Madagascar caramel fantasy.  They packaged my tiny cacao inspired goodies in a shiny black box & tied it up with a wide ribbon.  I almost felt guilty opening the box when I got home because most items you purchase for yourself don't come wrapped in such manner.    I just had the Arboli, which was the most exotic of my sweet surprises.  It had South American chili and Saigon cinnamon with a smooth dark chocolate.  If I had a signature chocolate it would be this one because it was sweet and spicy--loved it!!!!    The only downside is that these tiny treasures are not cheap, as previously stated.  However, the high quality ingredients, freshness and presentation make it worthwhile.  These truffles make great gifts for others or yourself.

This little place is great for a quick work lunch.  You get in, you get great food, you go back to work full but ready to finish the 2nd half of your day.  The salads are HUGE and last time I went, I split the regular sized salad with my friend & we shared the tiramisu for dessert.  My faves: Mandarin spinach salad--tons of spinach, mandarin oranges, tossed with a light dressing Steak and blue salad--loaded with thinly cut steak, walnuts & blue cheese Quattro formaggi pizza--4 diff cheeses, thin crust, & excellent re-heated Steak panino sandwich--tons of thinly sliced steak, bell peppers, onion, on their signature focaccia, served as an open faced sandwich.    Tiny but decent bar, good wait staff, quick service (even for groups), and reasonably priced food!

I needed a pet sitter for about 2 wks and nobody I knew could make a referral.  So, of course, I get online & start researching the in-home pet sitters that provided service in my city.  There were a handful but Kimbur Pet Care received my business for several reasons:  1. The owner loves pets--of all kinds.  When I called her initially to confirm availability, services, & prices, her warm/caring personality could be felt over the phone.  She spoke about her pets as 'family members' so I knew my precious babies were going to be 'cared for' not just 'looked after.'   2. Professional--The owner agreed to come to my house a week before my trip to meet me & the pets.  She brought many forms for me to complete, including info on health history, contact info, their likes/dislikes, etc.   3. Service excellence--She offered to do additional things beyond care for my pets, like collecting mail and even washed the pet dishes a few times over the course of my absence despite the fact that I provided additional bowls and told her not to worry about leaving dirty dishes in the sink.  She also graciously cleaned up after one of them when they got sick on my carpet--more than once! 4. Pricing--A full list of her services & prices are listed on the website.  Many of the sites I researched asked you to call for quotes.  That just drags out the research process, which I wanted to avoid.  In addition, I found her rates to be the lowest.   5. Flexibility--Related to pricing, she doesn't mandate daily visits.  Some pet sitters require that you have them come in daily and my pets don't require quite as much care.  I arranged to have Kimbur Pet Care come in every other day to provide fresh water/food and just make sure everyone was ok.  They have also been extremely flexible in terms of my travel schedule.  She even came out on Christmas Eve & New Year's Day! 6. Follow up--On the last day of the visit, she summarizes any key points and leaves a little note.  After her first job, she even left me a complimentary coupon for the local coffee house as a thank you.    I now use Kimbur Pet Care anytime I go out of town because of the excellent service I received the first time and recommend Kimbur Pet Care to everyone!!!  (Check out the website for additional information & list of their entire service area).

"PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN EATING AS THESE ARE BLISTERING HOT" is the warning printed under the fried pickles in the menu.  Ever wanted to try fried pickles?  How about cheesy beer soup?  Well, look no further because you can order both at Dillon's.  In fact, I've tried both.  The pickles were cut into bite-sized pieces, lightly battered and served with ranch & a 2nd spicy sauce.  As for the cheesy beer soup, it's viscosity was better suited for a plate of warm nachos.  In fact, the waitress provided soup samples a few times to aid in my decision making process.  Brisket is tasty but a little on the dry side.  I can definitely vouch for the beef stew, chicken tortilla soup, & diet Pepsi.  They also offer catering services and I suppose if you're 'starvin' like Marvin', you can order a gallon of potato salad.  However, you might have to call it in, before you get there...  This little gem is tucked inside the Sun City Grand.  Whether you sit inside or out, you have a great view of the golf course and water.  The scene provides a low key atmosphere where you can enjoy a meal.    Since I've only been there during lunch time, I can't comment on the happy hour environment, which runs from 2-7PM.  Yes, that's 5 whole hours of happy fun time, instead of the usual 3 hours at most places.  Drink deals are usually on a white board near the entrance and the best deal I read offered 10 oz drafts for $1.  I always forget they have HHs and need to check out the $1 drafts...

Before Starbucks saturated the market in non-traditional locations such as grocers, airports, and university campuses, it was one of the first things I researched before I traveled to any new city.  In fact, my first job in college was as a Barista, where I learned the art of brewing espresso on Thursday nights for students on break between classes, studying, or on late night coffee runs.  There's comfort knowing that a venti, skim, non-fat, no foam, hazelnut latte, will be the same product I've come to know and love regardless of the Starbucks site.  Seating--they have a pair of comfy seats in the corner perfect for secluded conversations or pouring over good reading material.   Several tables outside are protected from piercing sunrays by the structural design of the building.  Very few smokers frequent this shop, so you may enjoy your caffenated beverage without being assaulted by smoke.  Outlets--if your laptop battery longevity, you'll appreciate the numerous outlets all over the store.  Heck, they even have outlets near the ceiling.  The purpose of those outlets is unclear but who cares?  They HAVE outlets.  Ambiance--the background music is soft, the lighting is low, and the furniture consists mostly of chestnut colored tables for 2.  The store is painted in earthly greens, browns and other neutral tones.    Hours--A lil early this one closes @ 9:30PM nightly.  Drive thru--avoid this queue at all costs between 7-8:30AM.  WiFi--Without a contract with T-Mobile, you can get online for $6 p/hour or $9.99 for a 24-hour period.

I heard they had a great selection of beers, wine, & spirits but wasn't prepared for what I saw when I entered the store.  It's like the alcohol section at Costco on steroids.    Near the front of the store is a section with stem/barware, wine chillers, kegorators etc.  Walking toward the rear from that section are aisles of wine with great signage enabling customers to find items quickly.  In the rear of the store are the refrigerated cases for beer and some juices.  In the rear-mid section you'll find more shelves with beer and a few aisles with snackie-cakes and yum-yums to accompany your beverages.  Then from the beer section going toward the front of the store are the spirits and liquors.    I found a great Hawaiian beer there!  If you spend $250, you get a 5% discount toward a future purchase after you sign up for a store discount shopper card.    Gold stars for the great customer service, variety, affordable prices and store appearance/layout.  And it still has that 'new store' smell....

To put it simply--THIS PLACE ROCKS.  Why you ask?  Well, for starters, you won't waste half your life waiting in line, which is the usual if you frequent the the 'real' USPS on Bell.  Second, they're open til 9PM, so you aren't confined to a 5PM close--you can drop off packages after work!  Third, the people that work there are always pleasant and friendly.  Fourth, Party Planet is the 'Ultimate party super store'.   So, in case I forgot to pick up a grass skirt or need to rent a margarita machine, I can take care of it, after I send my care packages.  What more could you possibly want!

This place is phenomenal!!!  There are 24 regular courts and an amazing center court with blue surfacing and pristine white boundary lines.  The guy behind the counter asked if we wanted to play center court since there weren't many people out.  After contemplating whether we wanted an 'All-Star' experience, we declined realizing that we'd have a larger surface area to shag balls.  Most of the regular sized courts are built in tandem with an adjoining court, separated by a waist high, chain link fence.  In between the openings of the fence you'll find a shaded bench with water holder and small trash receptacle.    Water fountains are found throughout the complex and you could rent an automatic tennis 'tutor' if you just wanted to practice your swing.  Indoors, there are 2 raquet ball courts and some ping pong tables.  The complex has seasonal hours but from now until Aug 31st, they're open 7 days a week from 7:30AM to 11:30AM and 4PM to 10PM.    They also have a small 'pro shop' with select items.  If you're a Surprise resident you can rent a court for $2 and play for 1.5 hrs.  It's $3 if you're non-resident but the cost is minimal for a top notch facility.

After checkin out my fave NY&Co in AZ @ the ghetto fab Metro Center, I have a lil time before I hafta get to my next location & am starving.  Lookin for something quick & easy, I initially intend to go to Subway.  Then I see Z Pizza a few doors down & decide to check out the menu.    They had a pretty extensive menu with salads, pastas, & sandwiches offering something for everyone.  Instantly, I'm persuaded to order the $5.95 special--2 slices of pre-made pizza & a fountain drink.  Looking @ my choices in the warmer, the pizzas had just come outta the oven, so I figure the special is a decent choice.  I go with 2 slices of the napoli with fresh tomatoes, basil & mozzarella.  It was fantastic!!!    Location is nice too.  If you're in the mood for dessert, there's a coldstone, smoothie place, & starbux within walking distance.

Been here for lunch a few times.  Today was exceptionally disappointing.  We asked to be seated in a location with a little more privacy, suggesting a table.  After the hostess seats us, we wait for 5 mins while servers buzz around all the other tables.  My friend decides to go up to the hostess area to let them know we'd actually like to get served in this century.  We order the 'Bottomless Soup & Salad'.  It comes with bland tortilla chips & some decent pureed salsa.  The tortilla & baked potato soups are cream based, so it's pretty rich.  The house salads are ok but nothing to brag about.    The best thing about this place was our assigned server Jeff.  He was extremely apologetic about the 'rocky start' as he called it.  Our food came out within minutes of placing our order & I think he checked on us @ least 6 times.  We really appreciated his effort despite the food quality.

Two walls from the front to the rear of the store front are covered with rows of frames from Versace, Burberry, Gucci, A/X, Prada etc (no Coach) to other lower end styles.  I visited 2 other eye wear stores on Bell and The Village had the biggest selection of styles.  With a ceiling to floor glass front, the store was infused with lots of natural light.  I also liked the many different mirrors--framed, unframed, portrait--positioned so you could check out various options without having to search for a mirror.  The staff were extremely helpful, researching different color options for a few frames I liked.  They didn't exert their unwanted opinions about style selection or try to talk me into buying a lot of additional crap.    I just rec'd my glasses, less than 2 wks after I ordered them ; )  And they told me to return anytime, for a free adjustment, if I start to feel the glasses start to slide down the bridge of my nose or feel too tight around my ears after wearing them a bit.  A+ for selection & service!!!

Woke up to the man of the house weasing & barely able to lift his furry lil head.  After a few hours his condition seemed worse & he wasn't drinking.  The last time I saw a kitty with these symptoms, he was on the verge of renal failure at 17 yrs of age.  This lil guy is only 5, so off we go to WTAH.  The vet techs were extremely comforting as I was near panic wondering why it seemed like Aslan couldn't breathe.  When we were able to see the vet, she offered multiple solutions for diagnosis answering many of my questions.    Vet consultation:  $45 X-rays: $129 General health panel: $91 Feline Leukemia screen: $76  The general health panel included 31 lab results so that we could identify any immediate areas of concern.  All of his results returned in the normal range & they provided a copy  for my records.  Leukemia also returned negative.  Aslan was sent home with an antibiotic and the vet informed me if I didn't see improvement in a few days, to return for a procedure similar to a contrast test humans might get in radiology.  The lil guy is ok now.

Loved this place with its mod yet minimalist decor.  My friend wanted a spicy roll with scallop but didn't see it on the list.  When we asked the waitress, she had it made for us.    We also ordered spicy salmon & tuna rolls, salmon and yellow tail sushi and a large bowl of seafood soup with soba noodles.  The fish was great & the rolls were also fabulous but I wasn't a big fan of the soup.  The noodles were over cooked and too thick but the broth was flavorful and light.  The fish was about $3-5 for 2 pieces and rolls were on average $4-5.  All entrees seemed moderately priced.

I love the Yard House.  (I used to live in LA & the Yard House located on the pier in Long Beach is my absolute favorite place to lounge with friends).  The Yard House @ Westgate also has great ambiance.  The bar is always a fun place to sit and outdoor seating is enjoyable especially when the weather is nice.  Outdoors you can choose to sit in comfy patio chairs with cocktail tables or at regular tables that allow you a view of the center fountains.  Service--I've always had great service from the staff, even on a crowded night.  They always seem friendly and fun.  They do their best to accommodate and make decent recommendations when you're not sure what to order.  Food--The spinach dip is wonderful as an appetizer.  I usually order the thai chicken or walnut pear salad which I always get with the dressing on the side, in case I don't finish. I tried the roasted turkey pot pie once, which is HUGE and could feed 2 easily.  It held up well and wasn't half bad reheated....Beer is ALWAYS good.  I've never had a beer there that I didn't like and a while ago, you used to be able to buy a whole 'yarder', where they served you a beer in a yard long glass.  My out of town guests loved ordering the 'yarder' b/c it was a unique experience.    Cost--I do have to agree with some of the other posters--the prices could be better but I enjoy it there so much, that's just the trade off.

I'm looking for a comfortable environment, close to home (b/c I hate driving the distance to Phx & Scottsdale), where I can have a few drinks with friends, listen to music, & maybe dance.  I was hopeful that Crookside would be that place but I'm gonna have to go against the grain on my review...  Layout/Amenities--they have a couple pool tables on 1 side, the bar sits in the middle and on the other side is a large area with pub tables.  A raised platform with additional seating caused my friend & I to debate whether this place was a former strip club.  All that seemed missing were the poles...Lots of flat screen tvs & projection screens tuned to ESPN and various sporting events.  A definite plus.  They even had a flat screen mounted in the ladies room.  But the best thing they have goin for them is the 'Free WiFi' notice etched in block lettering on the tinted window out front.    Food--is so-so.  I haven't had many meals there but the quesadilla I had was a little on the greasy side, directly correlated to the cheese quality (or lack thereof).  The Italian wedding soup was decent but they could've scaled down the sodium content.  Food prices were reasonable despite my assessment of the quality of the food, especially if you're ordering during happy hour.  And if you stick to beer, there's no way they can screw it up (which has happened to others ordering off the drink menu).  Wait staff--were decent.  They made sure we had drinks and checked on us several times.    Crowd--a mix of older adults on double dates and single males.  I haven't been there @ night to assess the 'club crowd' so maybe the crowd is a little more balanced but after feeling 'leered at' during my few visits, I'm not convinced I want to check it out.  ...And so, the search for the local 'hot spot' continues....

Mamason was visiting and loves bingo, so we end up going since I hadn't been either.  Before we get through the door, I'm stopped for ID.  I think I look like an old bag but still got branded with the gigantic "Over 21" stamp--WTH!  It was smokey as hell and I found it amusing that while smoking was permitted indoors, there was a designated 'non-smoking' section in the bingo hall.  I don't play bingo & don't get excited about slots or card games.  It pisses me off to lose money.  So, I decide to ditch Mamason for a bit and grabbed a mlite, just as 2 people set up on a mini stage near 1 of the bars.  There was a tiny dance floor surrounded by seating.  People mostly listened to the duo trade off btwn vocals & the keyboard, singing contemporary, old school hip hop, and some 70s funk.  The crowd was disproportionately geriatric and there was one old lady who got up to dance to a Justin Timberlake song with some young stud, while everyone else pretty much gawked.  Emergency Medical Staff were on standby near the dance floor in case of cardiac arrest or hip injuries.  I'm being totally serious.  The only good thing about this place is that fountain drinks are free in the bingo hall (so bring your empty 2-liter bottles to fill up) & beer is $3.  Would I bring my mom back?  You bet.  She loved it & that's all that mattered.

Our wknd suite was the bomb like dot com!  We had 6 girls posted in 2 large rooms over Pro Bowl wknd.    First, the staff let us check in @ 11:30AM for free, when we explained that we traveled from HI on a red eye for our sister's b-party.  Then she moved us from the 6th floor to the 24th, which we didn't care about but when we arrived & saw our floor to ceiling windows, we appreciated the view.  The 'shades' were automated & both guest suite & the living room in btwn had projectors.  The master bdrm had a jacuzzi and plenty of space for me to spread out w/the bride to be.  Our kitchen had modern appliances with an island that doubled as a kitchen table, where we were all able to sit comfortably for pre-bridal shower activities before our official b-party @ Tao.  Another awesome feature is the 'Anything/Anytime' speed dial button.  Literally, you can anything you need @ anytime (within reason).    Most of us had been to Vegas before so we didn't care too much about staying directly on the strip.  In fact, we didn't walk the strip @ all that wknd but were close enough that it wouldn't have been an issue.  Plus, we were literally in the center of the strip and there was a huge mall downstairs for plenty of shopping.    Initially, I lobbied for stayin @ my top 4--Venetian, Bellagio, Mandalay or Wynn but this location was PERFECT for our trip.  I'd definitely consider stayin there again.
