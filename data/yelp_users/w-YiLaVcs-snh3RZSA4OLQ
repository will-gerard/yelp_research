I arrived at the airport a little over 2 hours before my flight in the evening. It was not busy at all. I got my bag checked in to United and then I procedded to security. There was a First Class line on the left side of the D gates. That line was totally empty so I got through security in a few minutes.  As I arrived at the gate, I found many power outlets under the seats so I plugged in my computer and attempted to get online. I turned on my WiFi connection and found that they provided free WiFi. I connected up to the Internet and the speed on the connection was great.

I took the Monorail multiple times this week and had a great experience.  The monorail was clean and all the signs were clearly marked.   Since the price is the same if you take it 1 stop or 3 stops, I like it when I go a little further. It's more bang for the buck.

We pulled up to the front of Fatburger and there was only 4 parking spaces which were like 15 minute zones. As there was a security guard watching the place, I asked her if we could park there and she said go right ahead.  Anyway, I went in to order some take out and I picked out a Large Fatburger. The menu was easy to understand and when I got my food it tasted great.  I'll be back for some more the next time I'm in Las Vegas.

I've been to the Buffet at Bellagio many times in the past. During my last visit last month to the Buffet at Bellagio, I was really disappointed. Since it was the Thanksgiving Holiday, they had a special holiday price that was a little more expensive. I don't mind paying more for quality, but the food wasn't up to par.  Starting with the Cesar salad, it wasn't fresh and very soggy, The Kobe style steak at the carving station was not very soft and moist. The sushi was good and fresh, but the selection was smaller than expected. I had a few of the other dishes, but nothing really satisfied me.  I think the dessert selection was the highlight. These was a large variety of desserts and I tried a bunch of them.  The drink service was good as the waiter was friendly, helpful, and quick to refill our cups.

I though this place was suppose to be good from what I have heard, but I was sadly disappointed. As I walked up to the cashier, she gave me the price which was about $28 per person, I gladly supplied her with my credit card. She gave me the charge receipt and I wrote the tip amount into the receipt. She took the receipt from me and said there is a problem with me tipping on the card because she already closed the transaction. She said it would be difficult for me to tip on the receipt because she would have to void the transaction and then recharge the transaction. I said that was a silly thing to do. Then she suggested that we just charge the tip amount on the card as a separate transaction. I finally said we would just pay in cash at the table. The service wasn't very helpful to accommodate my payment method.  The seating area was not very spectacular. It felt like a HomeTown buffet, but with a little more class. The food was not very fresh. The lettuce in the salad was rather wilted and didn't taste very good. I tried a little sushi, but the rice was very hard. My sister told me that when she picked the sushi up, the rice already cracked in half.  The prime rib and ribs were average. I do have to say the duck was rather tasty. I think this was the best part of the meal.  I tried some of their dessert, but was also disappointed. I felt the chocolate covered strawberries were rather mushy. As I walked toward the soft serve ice cream machine, I saw the machine being serviced.

I just saw this performance a few days ago. It was great. The stage was awesome, the actors were great, and I loved the music. But I think O at the Belagio is still my favorite.

I had lunch here today and it was nothing special. I had their dim sum and I think the the taste was just mediocre.  The quality of the food was alright as it didn't taste bad, but was not super tasty as well.   I only waited for about for about 5 minutes for my table. The food came about relatively quick, but I didn't see the waiter come by again until I finished my meal.

I've stayed here multiple times over the years. It used to be pretty good, but this time the hotel seemed pretty run down.   The internet service was very spotty and the tech support wasn't very help at all when I called in for t heir help. The front door of my room was always jammed so I called the front desk to fix the problem. The first thing they told me was that there shouldn't be a problem and told me to recheck it. I said I already did and they finally sent a person to change the lock which took another day. Then I also reported that my shower didn't drain properly. That work was completed in the same day so that was a good thing.  The free breakfast service lasted to 10am in the mornings, but if you come toward the last 15 to 20 minutes they take away some of the food and don't refill the rest like the scrambled eggs, yogurt, etc.  On top of everything, my sister got her gold compact taken from the room. I reported it to the front desk and housekeeping, but they weren't able to help out.

We used their taxi line today. We were surprised about how fast we got a taxi today. With the CES tradeshow, it was a good idea to go to the Renaissance to catch a cab.

We stopped by here for a quick lunch. The place was kid friendly and had high chairs. The menu was pretty standard with the rest of the L & L Hawaiian BBQ restaurants.   The service was great and they even brought our food to our table. We are used to just waiting to pick up the food at the counter.  We tried the mixed plate with BBQ short ribs, chicken, and pork. It was very tasty.
